Fractures intersecting two stimulation wells, PX-1 and PX-2, were identified through a comprehensive analysis of various data produced from drilling and hydraulic stimulations, including injection flow-pressure and seismicity data. Coupled hydromechanical numerical modeling of five stimulations performed in the PX-1 and PX-2 wells, showed that injection-induced hydraulic jacking and fracture shearing induce immediate stress transfer that plays a significant role in understanding seismic response at the Mw 5.5 fault. The friction coefficient times fluid pressure change by the PX-2 stimulations accounts for only 20% of the total CFS change at the location of the Mw 5.5 earthquake. The absence of seismic events at the Mw 5.5 fault by the PX-1 stimulations is attributed to the transfer of reduced shear stress at the PX-1 fracture due to shear slip. Kaiser effects in the seismic response observed during the PX-1 stimulation is explained by the irreversible nature of shear slip of the PX-1 fracture for the first time. In addition, post-injection seismicity, observed during the PX-2 stimulations, is attributed to a low permeability of the PX-2 fracture. The current modeling study suggests that coupled hydromechanical analysis with appropriate consideration of fractures is a powerful approach in understanding the mechanism of injection-induced seismicity in fractured geological media.\n               ","1":"\n                  Intersecting discontinuities are often encountered in rock engineering and sometimes associated with damaging geohazards. Our understanding of intersecting discontinuities instability remains vastly insufficient due to difficulties in comprehensively monitoring the failure process. Here we use microseismic (MS) monitoring to virtualize the MS events in the rock masses surrounding a powerhouse crown and investigate the effect of geological features on the occurrence of MS events. We subsequently build a three-dimensional numerical model and validate this model using the in-situ measurements by multipoint displacement meters. The numerical results demonstrate how the displacements of surrounding rock masses near the fault and the dyke increase and reveal possible causes, such as stress condition as well as geometry and orientation of rock discontinuities. We also discuss the correlation between the tempo-spatial distribution of MS events and the failure pattern of rock masses and confirm the weakened dyke as the main cause of the rock collapse. This study highlights that the stability of intersecting discontinuities can be controlled by both the geometrical and mechanical properties of individual discontinuities, and attentions should be paid to key properties favorable for rock instability.\n               ","2":"\n                  The relationship between velocity, acceleration, and dynamic fracture toughness during rapid crack propagation is difficult to effectively capture. In this study, a novel semi-circular holed disc bend is proposed to achieve a long fracture path. Hopkinson pressure rods with crack growth and strain gauges are used to impact the semi-circular holed disc bend specimens and to monitor the cracking process of a mode-I fracture. The experiments show that the crack growth speed increases to a critical value after crack initiation and then oscillates as a result of the reflected stress wave. The dynamic propagation fracture toughness (K\n                     IC\n                     d) increases with increasing crack velocity for steady crack propagation; however, this does not apply for unsteady propagation.

This provides support for predicting the location of the fault during the in situ stress tunnel construction when ignoring the shape and width of the fault. The results show that the effective wave velocity of the jointed rock masses increases with increasing in situ stress when a normally incident P-wave impinges upon a single joint. Considering multiple parallel joints, the magnitude and time of the maximum peak of the transmitted wave are decreases and delayed correspondingly with the increase in the number of joints, respectively. Moreover, multisource seismic interferometry is used to predict the location of the fault at different surrounding rock wave velocities and dip angles of the fault, which contribute to the identification of unfavorable geological bodies on the tunnel advanced geological predictions.\n               ","4":"\n                  Flooding induced uplift for abandoned coal mines is monitored mainly by satellite data and geodetic levelling. Predictions are based on empirical formulas, but nowadays numerical simulation procedures provide an interesting alternative, because it is physically based and allows to consider complex mining, geological and hydrological conditions. According to the key driving mechanisms, the uplift process can be classified as either confined\/unconfined (in respect to the mine water), isolated\/connected (in respect to ponds) and with\/without faults (in respect to the tectonic situation).

Using 3D fully coupled fluid flow-geomechanics simulations, it is shown that when time-dependent deformation occurs in the caprock, the shear stress decreases in the caprock but increases in the reservoir. The magnitude of this transfer of shear stress from caprock to reservoir is affected by the characteristic time scale of the time-dependent deformation of the adjacent formations. Compared to an elastic response, viscoelastic deformation of the caprock produces a higher possibility of fault failure within the reservoir during and after CO2 injection. The implication is that if the time-dependent deformation of the caprock is neglected by assuming the purely elastic behavior of the caprock, the geomechanical risk will be underestimated.\n               ","6":"\n                  The presence of geological faults is a significant contributing factor to coal burst in underground mining. In this study, a large-scale discontinuum model was established based on geological and geotechnical conditions in a mine site, where a longwall face passed through a major fault. Four model indicators were calculated during the longwall retreat: model seismic energy (energy released by the model system), fault seismic energy (energy released by fault-slip only), peak abutment stress and maximum strain energy density in coal seam. The change pattern of model seismic energy in the discontinuum model was calibrated against the seismic energy recorded in the mine site. It aims to verify that the model seismic energy can properly demonstrate the seismic energy observed in practice. The model results showed that the peak abutment stress and maximum strain energy density in coal seam increased when the longwall face approached the major fault, and then both of them experienced a most significant reduction when the largest fault-slip event occurred. A coal burst risk classification was then developed using multiple model indicators for the case study. A parametric study was conducted based on the calibrated model, which aims to investigate the impacts of various conditions on both fault-slip behaviour and stress and strain energy distributions around longwall excavations. Four factors were studied: the static friction angle of fault, the cover depth of fault, the dip angle of the coal seam and the mining direction. This study and the proposed model indicators can provide an improved understanding of fault-slip burst mechanisms and insights into the associated coal burst proneness assessment.\n               ","7":"\n                  Fluid injection into a rock mass from industrial processes can cause perceivable seismic events that may raise public concern. This seismicity can be caused by injection-induced fluid pressure in the rock mass causing slip on faults. Here we provide a method to distinguish between aseismic and seismic mobilisation and to predict fault movement due to anthropogenic fluid injection. This was achieved by extending a two-dimensional fully coupled fluid and mechanical loading extended finite element model (X-FEM) via development of a dynamic analysis module as a standalone code in Matlab. This code considers fluid flow along the fault as well as into the rock mass and uses a directly proportional equivalent injected flow rate into the fault as the input. This model was validated by comparing the resultant pressure and normal and shear displacements calculated at the centre of the fault against observations from a decametre-scale in-situ experiment. The main results were that not only the mechanics of the fault could be simulated using this approach, but that the simulation correctly predicted the onset of seismicity and transition to dynamic analysis and at similar seismic magnitudes to observations. Parametric studies investigated the influence of the flow rate (when injecting a constant volume of water) and the effect of rate and state frictional parameters in representing modes of seismicity. The main conclusion is that this modelling technique using X-FEM provides an accurate method in accurately predicting modes, location and timing of fault remobilisation due to fluid injection inclusive of important precursory aseismic fault movements. These results are important, since they demonstrate the applicability of this X-FEM approach in accurately predicting the mechanics of fault reactivation and the resultant seismicity, aiding in the design and scheduling of fluid injection operations and in the optimisation of operational parameters.\n               ","8":"\n                  Cyclic fluid injection has been demonstrated as a plausibly effective and controllable strategy to mitigate the seismic risks during hydraulic stimulation. The mechanism involved remains largely unconstrained, and our ability to control the activation of critically stressed, locally undrained faults is still limited. Injection-induced activation of these faults can be one of the most threatening scenarios as they likely perturb the stability of nearby faults beyond the stimulation volume. Here, we perform a series of laboratory fluid injection tests on critically stressed, locally undrained faults in low-permeability granite to offer insights into cyclic fluid injection as a possible solution for seismic risk mitigation. Our results show that cyclic fluid injection promotes fluid pressure diffusion on the faults, but a reduction in seismic moment release depends on several cycle-related factors, such as the critical injection pressure and injection frequency. Particularly, cyclic fluid injection could be inefficient for fluid pressure diffusion if the critical injection pressure is very close to the predicted pressure at fault failure, or over-reduced to cause excess fluid injection and long-term frictional healing. A proper design of injection parameters is thus essential to balance the energy budget between the seismic energy and hydraulic energy. Our study reveals that the effectiveness of cyclic fluid injection is also dependent on fault drainage conditions, stimulation requirements, as well as dynamic responses of faulted reservoirs, which could guide the future development of cyclic fluid injection.\n               ","9":"\n                  The instability caused by the fault slip is one of the main factors that induce the occurrence of coal bursts. To in-depth understand the mechanisms responsible for coal bursts during the underground coal seam mining, a mechanical model used to calculate the stress distribution on fault surface and illustrate the fault slip characteristics is proposed by considering the mining-induced stress. In order to verify the validity of this model, a set of comparative analyses with experimental results which have been published in the previous studies are carried out. The results show that the normal and shear stress distribution on the fault surface calculated by the mechanical model is approximately consistent with the experimental stress results. According to the calculated stress distribution on the fault surface, normal and reverse faults formation mechanism are explained by this mechanical model when the lateral pressure coefficient is greater than 1.0 and less than 1.0. Meanwhile, fault potential energy is proposed to research the energy storage and further explain the mechanism of fault slip. In addition, the coal bursts occurrence induced by fault slip is also discussed according to the engineering background and this mechanical model.\n               ","10":"\n                  Hydraulic stimulation in an enhanced geothermal reservoir (EGS) often creates a complex fracture network. It is understood that a fracture network includes both preexisting natural fractures and newly formed fractures. Analyzing the interaction between preexisting fractures and newly formed fractures during hydraulic stimulation is thus necessary to better understand the creation of a fracture network.\n                  In this study, we conducted laboratory scale hydraulic fracturing experiments to investigate how a fracture network is created when a propagating hydraulic fracture and a preexisting fracture interact. We observed that a secondary fracture (wing crack) was initiated and propagated from the tip of one side of a slipping preexisting fracture when a propagating hydraulic fracture follows the preexisting fracture. The laboratory experiments were analyzed by a numerical model that fully couples fluid flow between fracture surfaces and fracture deformations. The numerical analysis shows that the stress field induced by an upstream hydraulic fracture causes asymmetric distributions of normal and shear stresses along the preexisting fracture when they intersect, which resulted in initiation of a wing crack from the fracture tip on the side with larger angles. If a preexisting fracture is sufficiently large so that those tips are far from the strong effect of stress shadowing by an upstream fracture, it is possible that wing cracks propagate from both tips of the preexisting fracture. The wing cracks observed in the experiments are an important factor in improving reservoir permeability in an EGS reservoir because it has been observed in the field that secondary fractures that form as a result of fault slip can link originally discontinuous faults and enhance hydraulic conductivity underground. This type of reservoir permeability enhancement may be expected to occur by hydraulic stimulation because slipping preexisting fractures are better connected to one another by the formation of wing cracks.\n               ","11":"\n                  Swarms of earthquakes during shale gas exploitation in the Changning area of Sichuan Basin indicate that hydraulic fracturing induces seismicity both within the target reservoir but also to depths of several kilometers below the horizontal well. These remote earthquakes are possibly triggered by total stress perturbations resulting from the hydraulic fracturing. We use a dislocation-based analytical model to simulate multistage hydraulic fracturing of three horizontal wells at a single well pad to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of total stress perturbations. Results show that the number and distribution of fracturing stages affect both the distribution and magnitude of stress changes and that the stress change diminishes with distance. The undrained injection-induced stress change is below 10-3\u00a0MPa\u00a0at distances \u22651\u00a0km for first-stage fracturing but reach 10-1\u00a0MPa for multistage fracturing of 30 stages in three wells. Undrained stress changes scale linearly with the magnitude of fluid leakoff into the formation \u2013 halving the effective fracture width halves the induced stress magnitudes and with an identical distribution \u2013 limiting the potential for fault reactivation. Scaling analysis for pressure diffusion distal from the reservoir indicate that the short-term impact is indeed essentially undrained. Estimates for long-term depletion identify a similar induced stress signal of opposite sign but with similar Coulomb potential for reactivation in the long-term. Such magnitudes of Coulomb stress changes suggest the possibility of fault reactivation on critically-stressed faults at kilometer separation from the injection both in the short-term due to stimulation and in the long-term resulting from depletion.\n               ","12":"\n                  The extraction of shallow ore deposits using underground mining methods rather than open pit mining is not uncommon nowadays, especially with the increased environmental constraints. Such scenario results in the creation of a surface crown pillar - the rock cover consisting of ore rocks that separate the uppermost stopes from the overlying surface. Although the problem of surface crown pillar stability has been researched for more than 30 years, the design guidelines are still limited. This is largely because of the wide variety and complexity of site-specific conditions. Thus, empirical and analytical methods are only used for preliminary design and more comprehensive methods such as numerical modelling must be adopted for the final design. This paper investigates strategies for the design of a surface crown pillar at a gold mining operation having a shallow, steeply dipping orebody that extends underneath an existing tailings storage facility. The orebody is in the vicinity of two regional faults. In this study, numerical modelling approaches are developed using the finite difference code FLAC3D 7.0. Critical factors such as in-situ stress regime, major geological structures, mining sequences, slanted surface topography and surcharge are considered. A model parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of fault properties and horizontal stress ratios on surface crown pillar stability. Mining-induced surface subsidence is then analyzed to shed light on the anticipated maximum differential settlement and distortion developed in the tailings dam foundation as a result of the mining activities. Predicted differential settlement results could serve as another criterion for crown pillar sizing from the perspective of overlying infrastructure stability. The reactivation of two nearby faults due to mining activities is also explored. It appears that larger shear displacements occur on the fault that is parallel to the orebody strike compared to the cross fault.\n               ","13":"\n                  Crystalline rock has been tested\/selected by many countries for developing underground nuclear waste repositories at ~500\u00a0m depth to achieve geological isolation of high-level, long-lived radioactive waste. During the assessment period of up to one million years, large earthquakes may occur around the repository and trigger coseismic displacements along secondary fractures, jeopardising the integrity of the buffer-waste canister system. It is, therefore, of great importance to understand the coseismic behaviour of the repository site during large earthquakes. In this paper, we develop a finite element method-based seismo-mechanical model to simulate the response of fractured rocks subject to both in-situ stresses and seismic activities. The model can well capture the fracture displacement behaviour under dynamic loadings involving alternating regimes of contact loss, partial slip and total sliding. We model the earthquake-induced displacement field according to the seismic source theory in combination with a generic source time function. We apply the model to the nuclear waste repository site at Forsmark, Sweden, and analyse the coseismic responses of both single fractures and fracture networks during a potential post-glacial earthquake with a moment magnitude of M\n                     w\u00a0=\u00a05.6. The shear dislocation of a single fracture is strongly dependent on the fracture length and dip angle, while the displacement pattern of a fracture network is dominated by its \u201cbackbone\u201d structures. We observe that significant coseismic shear displacement occurs if the fractured rock is close to the hypocentre and located in the dilational quadrant of the primary fault due to reduced shear resistance. However, the earthquake-induced shear displacement decreases drastically with the increased distance to the hypocentre and a distance of ~700\u00a0m may be needed for a fracture up to 100\u00a0m long to not displace beyond 5\u00a0cm. If two repeated earthquakes would occur, a distance of ~1200\u00a0m may be necessary.\n               ","14":"\n                  The open question of asymmetric large-scale pulverisation of fault zone was experimentally investigated in this paper. It is found that the transition of rock fracture from local splitting to pervasive pulverisation is controlled by strain both in quasi-static and dynamic conditions. This can explain the asymmetric damage in the fault zone as the strain threshold to pulverisation for stiffer rock is lower. In terms of the cyclic dynamic loadings, four types of fracture patterns (lateral tension, axial split, spatial fragmentation, and pervasive pulverisation) were developed with the increase of strain. Subject to the long-term quasi-static and dynamic load, the cumulative damage to the fault zone broadens the scale of pulverisation. In light of the linear correlation of energy absorption to strain, the damage relationships between strain and loading cycles were established and found to offer a good prediction of experimental data.\n               ","15":"\n                  Fault reactivation due to water injection is assessed within the scope of nuclear waste disposal design.

A conceptual model is first presented to understand the hydro-mechanical coupling behavior between water pressure and rock joint movement. The model simulations show that the dominant factors on fault slip are shear stress and frictional resistance. Moreover, modeling shows that fault reversible opening in the normal direction occurs first at a lower pressure, whereas shear displacement as a result of shear slip is produced once a sufficiently high pressure is reached. We demonstrate that a coupled numerical analysis of the rock displacement trend and fluid pressure measured at the injection point allow an in-situ estimation of the principal stresses.\n               ","16":"\n                  The presence of fault gouge and the generation of wear material between two sliding rock surfaces plays a critical role in slip weakening and propagation of ruptures along underground brittle shear fractures forming ahead of tabular excavations in deep and high stress gold mining. We performed two types of friction experiments: one with a fault gouge layer between two sliding surfaces, and the other without a fault gouge layer \u2018rock-on-rock\u2019, both under room dry conditions at slip velocities ranging from ~1.0\u00a0mm\/s to 1200\u00a0mm\/s. These friction experiments revealed a remarkable difference in the frictional weakening behaviour, e.g., rock-on-rock friction experiments show weakening behaviour at lower slip velocity (~5\u00a0mm\/s) and generally has lower frictional strength than those with the intervening fault gouge between sliding surfaces. This study shows that the existence of the fault gouge layer between sliding rock surfaces delays the onset of fault weakening (i.e., slip weakening displacement of gouge layer experiments is larger compared to rock-on-rock experiments). It is proposed that flash heating may be the main active weakening mechanism within both our gouge and rock-on-rock experiments, and provides a feasible account for the observed weakening. The observed slip weakening displacement (Dc) differences may be attributed to the presence of a gouge layer between sliding surfaces, which has many more contacts during sliding compared to rock-on-rock experiments, thus reducing the average slip velocity per contact, consequently, the potential for activation of flash heating which delays the onset of weakening. Here we suggest that we may be able to describe brittle shear fracture rupture propagation process along underground brittle shear zones by conducting low, intermediate and high slip velocity friction experiments with and without an intervening fault gouge between sliding rock surfaces. These findings should have important implications for the modelling of rupture propagation processes in underground shear zones, a phenomenon that influences the severity of rockbursts, and hence the safety of mine workers and mining operations.\n               ","17":"\n                  Fault reactivation may lead to induced seismicity, damage to wells and loss of containment of potentially harmful and economically valuable fluids or gas in the subsurface. For this reason, fault reactivation is assessed in hydrocarbon development projects, in particular when injecting water, gas, or steam, but also when disposing of (contaminated) water or CO2 in depleted oil or gas reservoirs. In this paper, we compare the results obtained by a Mohr-circle evaluation and two-dimensional Finite-Element (FE) analysis that are commonly used to assess the likelihood of fault reactivation. It is found that Mohr-circle evaluations provide a non-conservative estimate of the allowable reservoir pressure in cases where the reservoir is offset by a fault. In practice, this may comprise virtually all imageable faults, as the limited seismic resolution does not allow interpretation of faults with no or small throws. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the maximum (vertical) element size for capturing the onset of fault slip with sufficient accuracy is about 2% of the reservoir thickness. Finite-element models with larger vertical element size increasingly over-estimate the depletion pressure required to cause fault reactivation or won't predict fault reactivation at all, thereby under-estimating the hazard associated with fault reactivation. This paper concludes with recommendations for evaluating onset of fault slip using Mohr-circles, and two- and three-dimensional finite-element analysis.\n               ","18":"\n                  Most onshore basins have experienced one or more phases of burial and erosion.

The changes in strains and stress state and the displacements, including bedding slip, which occur with changes of the overlying load, are tracked. Changes of mechanical properties to represent diagenesis are included. Development of the widely reported \u2018high\u2019 horizontal normal stresses results from the changes of vertical load and does not rely directly on applied horizontal tectonic shortening strains. Lateral gradients of normal stress associated with faults are described. The final basin stress state is related to the magnitudes of the burial and erosion, diagenetic or otherwise changes of mechanical properties and pore pressure changes during burial and at depth. The magnitudes of the horizontal stress developed for the 1\u00a0km and 2\u00a0km burial and erosion cycles tested here exceed the magnitude of the vertical stress for a range of depths extending downwards from the surface unless the horizontal stress is reduced at shallow depths by failure during erosion.

The model simulations focused on (1) an experiment activating a discontinuity (fracture or minor fault) within the damage zone of the main fault, and (2) an experiment activating discontinuities close to the core of the Main Fault. The experimental data consist of coupled hydraulic and mechanical responses monitored at an injection borehole and a monitoring borehole located a few meters away. After overcoming several modeling issues along with necessary model developments, a reasonably good agreement was achieved between the modeling results and the field observations. The fault activation experiments displayed an abrupt flow rate increase associated with a sudden fracture opening and rupture propagation after the injection pressure reached above the estimated normal stress on the fracture. This was followed by an abrupt flow rate decrease, indicating hydraulic closing, once the injection pressure decreases to an estimated 1\u20132\u00a0MPa below the stress normal to the opened fracture. The models were able to capture this abrupt hydromechanical behavior, including an observed dominant opening behavior along with the rupture propagation, while the spatial extent of the shear rupture and the quantity of peak injection flow were the most challenging to predict.\n               ","20":"\n                  Rock samples obtained from excavation and fault damage zones are friable, and it is challenging to obtain cylindrical specimens from such rocks using coring bits in the lab. On the other hand, preparation of prismatic specimens may be less destructive because it does not exert excessive rotational torque around the sides of the rock as in the preparation of cylindrical specimens. Therefore, prism-shaped specimens could become a more favorable sample geometry when working with highly fragile rock samples. However, prism specimens may experience shape-specific boundary effects during mechanical deformation due to the presences of corners and edges, which might cause differences in the measured rock strength and elastic properties compared to a cylindrical specimen. This study aims to investigate how the corners and edges of prism specimens affect the apparent strength and moduli of samples via comparison of laboratory data and finite element modelling results. We find that the prismatic samples can have higher apparent elastic moduli due to the enhanced confinement at the sample edges, which in turn also increases the measured compressional strengths of prism samples compared to cylindrical samples. Whether this apparent strengthening effect influences laboratory data interpretation will also depend on the degree of sample variability and how well specimen edge boundary conditions are controlled.\n               ","21":"\n                  Fault zones are key features in crystalline geothermal reservoirs or in other subsurface environments due to the fact that they act as main fluid pathways.

To address this topic, we demonstrate a novel experimental set up (Punch-Through Shear test) that is able to generate a realistic shear zone (microfault) under in-situ reservoir conditions while simultaneously measuring permeability and dilation. Three samples of intact granite from the Odenwald (Upper Rhine Graben) were placed into a MTS 815 tri-axial compression cell, where a self-designed piston assembly punched down the inner cylinder of the sample creating the desired microfault geometry with a given offset. Permeability was measured and fracture dilation was inferred from an LVDT extensometer chain, as well as the balance of fluid volume flowing in and out of the sample.

Formation of a microfault increased the permeability of the granite rock by 2 to almost 3 orders of magnitude. Further shear displacement led to a small increase in permeability by a factor of 1.1 to 4.0, but permeability was reduced by a factor of 2.5 to 4 within 16 h due to compaction and fault healing. Effective pressure cycling led to reversible permeability changes.

Cracks propagate to the fault zone eventually, leading to asymmetrical collapse. The stress loosening zone (SLZ) in the surrounding rock after tunnel excavation is significantly influenced by the fault zone near the left shoulder of the tunnel, showing the occurrence of stress redistribution.

We proposed a modeling approach for simulating the processes using the TOUGH-FLAC simulator, and modeled a fault reactivation experiment conducted at Mont Terri Rock Laboratory in Switzerland. The first step of the study involved benchmark calculations considering a simplified fault plane and geometry. Fluid flow along a fault was modeled using elements of aperture-sized thickness on the basis of Darcy's law and the cubic law in TOUGH2, whereas the mechanical behavior of a single fault was represented by zero-thickness interface elements in FLAC3D upon which a slip and\/or separation is allowed. A methodology to connect a TOUGH2 volume element to a FLAC3D interface element was developed for handling the hydro-mechanical interactions on the fault during fluid injection. Two different fault models for describing the evolutions of hydraulic aperture by elastic fracture opening and failure-induced aperture increase were considered in the benchmark calculations. In the coupling process, the changes in geometrical features and hydrological properties induced by mechanical deformation were continuously updated. The transient responses of the fault and host rock to stepwise pressurization were examined during the simulation. The hydro-mechanical behavior, including the injection flow rate, pressure distribution around the borehole, stress conditions, and displacements in normal and shear directions were monitored in the surrounding rock and along the fault. The results of benchmark calculations suggest that the developed model reasonably represents the hydro-mechanical behavior of a fault and the surrounding rock. This modeling approach was applied to the fault reactivation experiment of the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory. In this interpretive modeling, a parametric study was conducted to examine the effects of input parameters regarding in situ stress and fault properties on the hydro-mechanical responses of the fault to water injection. Then, an optimal parameter set to reproduce the field experiment results was chosen by trial-and-error. The injection flow rate and pressure response during fault reactivation closely matched those obtained at the site, which indicates the capability of the model to appropriately capture the progressive pathway evolution during fault reactivation tests at the site.

Our results indicate that the sharp extension of velocity-weakening zone occurs before the nucleation of fault rupture, which could be an indicator to avoid the reactivation of other fault patches beyond the stimulated zone. The dynamic rupture is estimated to extend much faster than the maximum speed of the velocity-weakening zone front.

The developed methodology starts by defining various fault categories present in the Dutch subsurface based on reservoir setting and fault properties, such as throw, dip, strike and transmissibility. For all fault categories initiation criteria for fault re-activation have been developed based on a new Coulomb stability relationship. The depletion-induced poro-elastic stress changes depend on the reservoir geometry and the fault transmissibility while the induced shear stresses are determined from differential vertical displacement profiles. The induced shear stress is either caused by the fault throw or by the pressure difference caused by the (partly) sealing fault or at the boundary fault. Analysis of the Coulomb stability function allows determination of the relative importance of poro-elastic stressing relative to differential compaction. The critical reservoir pressure depletion for fault re-activation to occur has been determined for open, intra-reservoir faults with or without a throw, (partly) sealing intra-reservoir faults and boundary faults. Satisfying this Coulomb criterion is the first necessary mechanical condition for seismicity to occur.

It is apparent that the dyke had caused a stress redistribution in its vicinity, which led to a stress concentration in the \u201changing wall\u201d and stress release in the \u201cfootwall\u201d.\n                  Three-dimensional numerical modelling was conducted with both a panel-scale large model and a roadway-scale small model to investigate the stress distribution and strain energy concentration in the vicinity of the dyke during longwall mining. The modelling results agreed well with the monitoring data, further clarifying the mechanisms of the dyke influenced stress distribution.\n               ","29":"\n                  Similar to the damage zone in the vicinity of faults, rock joints are composed of single or multiple fracture process zones, highlighting a high crack density and a decrease of Young\u2019s modulus. Here specimens of limestone joint and granite joint were subjected to cyclic tensile stress of increasing amplitudes, up to failure. The cyclic tension tests were to study the elasticity and crack density adjacent to rock joints. Results show that the vast majority of tensile strain accommodates in the vicinity of rock joint, and rock joints have a nonlinear mechanical behavior during loading while a nearly linear behavior during unloading in the tensile stress-strain curves. A gradual reduction in Young\u2019s modulus is seen with the increase of tensile strain. The cumulative crack damage after each stress cycle also induces a decrease in Young\u2019s modulus. A stiffer response is found when switching from loading to unloading. During the unloading, a recovery in tensile strain and crack damage is observed, but some unrecoverable damage remains in the rock joint sample after each loading-unloading cycle. Based on the differential scheme, a constitutive model using two crack-related parameters, i.e., initial crack density and crack density increment, is developed. The model can give a micromechanical explanation and well reproduce the nonlinearity and hysteresis of tensile stress-strain curves.\n               ","30":"\n                  Traditionally in seismology and in acoustic emission (AE), full moment tensor (MT) is applied as a default model of the mechanism. We present an alternative - an application of shear tensile crack (STC) source model to AEs generated by uniaxial compression loading of Westerly granite. The advantages of STC over the conventional MT are as follows: (i) contrary to the MT, the STC is physical source since it describes straight and simple fracture modes anticipated inside a loaded sample, namely the shear-slip and both of opening and closing tensile cracks; and (ii) the STC is simpler because it is described by fewer parameters (five instead of six required for an unconstrained MT), an essential feature for stabilizing the inverse problem.\n                  Better suitability of STC over MT is demonstrated by three exemplary AEs (tensile, shear, and combined). The obtained results were confirmed using a statistical analysis of 1630 reliably determined source mechanisms. The STC, as compared to the MT, provides smaller confidence regions for orientation and even smaller regions for decomposition parameters. Thus, the STC solution appeared to be substantially more useful than the MT, namely for mechanisms with a high content of non-double-couple (non-DC) component, as it allowed better distinction between tensile and shear AEs.\n                  Grain scale cracks of tension and combined source type, localized within the middle-height circumferential portion of the specimen, dominated fracturing. Azimuthal distribution of fault planes was found to be approximately uniform for all three source types. The fault dip increased with increasing content of the non-DC component. The average values were 16\u00b0, 21\u00b0, and 26\u00b0 for the tensile, combined and shear source types, respectively. The specimen failed by flaking in areas of a high AE activity. AE locations and failure mechanisms indicate a perfect confinement end-boundary conditions between the tested specimen and the loading platens.\n               ","31":"\n                  Fault deformation or slip activated by underground mining, hydraulic fracture stimulation, and construction activities can cause devastating earthquakes or rockbursts. Fault deformability is significantly affected by the distribution and evolution of non-uniform stress around the faults. However, quantifying the continuous evolution of the full-field stress near natural rough faults using conventional methods is a challenging task due to the difficulties in discriminating and extracting stresses near a rough fault. This study proposes an optical characterization method to extract and quantify the continuous distributions and evolutions of the full-field principal stress difference and shear stress around a rough fault model. Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology and stress-sensitive photopolymers were utilized to fabricate a transparent rough fault model according to Barton's standard rough profiles. A planar testing device was designed to mimic geostress conditions and fault deformation. The conventional phase-shifting method and unwrapping algorithm were modified to quantify the continuous evolution of the principal stress difference and shear stress near rough faults. The effect of fault roughness on the distribution and evolution of the full-field stresses around the fault was also evaluated. A positive relationship between the undulating angle and the near-fault stress was established for the rough fault model. Results show that the proposed method works well for quantifying and visualizing full-field stress distribution and evolution during fault deformation.\n               ","32":"\n                  There are many uncertain factors impacting stability analyses of rock structures. Quantification of these factors significantly impact the engineering decision making process. Some of these factors are spatially distributed within the geological domain, and the quantification of the spatial uncertainty is beneficial for stability analysis of the structure. This paper proposes an integrated methodology for a stability analysis of rock structure by incorporating spatially varying factors. This research models two key factors: one categorical structural parameter (fault zones) and one continuous geotechnical parameter (rock quality designation (RQD)). Two geostatistical simulation algorithms i.e., sequential indicator simulation and sequential Gaussian simulation are applied to quantify the spatial uncertainty by generating multiple equiprobable simulation maps of fault zones and RQD values. A slope stability analysis is performed by modeling the spatially varying fault zones and RQD. The proposed method is validated using a synthetic data set. The results from the synthetic data show the stability value of the synthetic data closely match with stability value calculated from simulated data. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a slope stability analysis for an open pit mine design where limited exploration data is available. Geostatistically simulated RQD maps from the case study mine are analyzed to determine a safe slope angle of 44\u00b0 for the open pit mining operation. The proposed method can be applied for quantifying other geotechnical risk and integrated within any stability analysis framework.\n               ","33":"\n                  The process whereby a brittle fault was activated by mining is not only significant for disaster prediction, but also for earthquake prediction. Thus, it was necessary to study their activation process. In this study, stress state, AE (acoustic emission)\/MS (microseismic) activities during brittle fault activation, stages of brittle fault activation, and the relation between AE\/MS activities and brittle fault parameters were analysed and it was feasible to identify buried brittle faults, determine their parameters and activation process based on MS monitoring. The No. 22517 working face in the Dongjiahe Coalmine was taken as an example. Firstly, a buried brittle fault was identified in No. 22517 working face by the MS monitoring method. Secondly, the buried brittle fault parameters were determined. Its azimuth angle was 307.5\u00b0 in the orbital roadway and 357.5\u00b0 on the haulage roadway. Its dip angle was 73\u00b0 and it was a reverse fault. Thirdly, the activation process of the buried brittle fault was determined. The buried brittle fault was not affected by the mining activities when the distance (from mining activities to the buried brittle fault) was over 300\u202fm, the \u2018disturbance stage\u2019 was from 300\u202fm to 80\u202fm, and the \u2018local activation stage\u2019 from 100\u202fm to 30\u202fm, and the \u2018whole activation stage\u2019 around 30\u202fm. The b value decreased during the process of brittle fault activation and reached a minimum value at the whole activation stage; it was concluded that these changes are related to the stress distribution around the brittle fault. The results demonstrated that MS monitoring technology can detect small buried brittle faults ahead of the working face, and is also an effective method to study the process and mechanism of brittle fault activation.\n               ","34":"\n                  This paper provides an overview of an international research collaboration for advancing the understanding and modeling of coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in geological systems. The creation of the international DECOVALEX Project, now running for over 25 years, was initially motivated by the recognition that prediction of these coupled effects is an essential part of the performance and safety assessment of geologic disposal systems for radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Later it was realized that these processes also play a critical role in other subsurface engineering activities, such as storage of CO2, exploration of enhanced geothermal systems, and unconventional oil and gas production through hydraulic fracturing. Research teams from radioactive waste management organizations, national research institutes, regulatory agencies, universities, as well as industry and consulting groups have participated in the DECOVALEX Project, providing a wide range of perspectives and solutions to these complex problems. Analysis and comparative modeling of state-of-the-art field and laboratory experiments has been at the core of the collaborative work, with an increasing focus on characterizing uncertainty and blind prediction of experimental results. Over these 25 years, many of the major advances in this field of research have been made through DECOVALEX, as evidenced by three books, seven journal special issues, and a good number of seminal papers that have emerged from the DECOVALEX modeling work. Examples of specific research advances will be presented in this paper to illustrate the significant impact of DECOVALEX on the current state-of-the-art of understanding and modeling coupled THMC processes. These examples range from the modeling of large-scale in situ heater tests representing mock-ups of nuclear waste disposal tunnels, to studies of fluid flow and chemical-mechanical coupling in heterogeneous fractures, and to the numerical analysis of controlled-injection meso-scale fault slip experiments.\n               ","35":"\n                  We introduce a new miniature double direct shear (mini-DDS) apparatus, housed within a standard-triaxial (TEMCO) pressure vessel, capable of concurrently measuring the evolution of frictional strength, stability, healing and along-fault permeability under in situ conditions of stress and temperature. The apparatus accommodates gouge samples (25\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f32\u202fmm) and intact rock samples with confining and shear stresses and pore pressures up to \u223c26\u202fMPa.

We describe protocols and procedures for calibration and experiments and note the potential of the apparatus for both rapid and extended-duration measurements of friction-permeability evolution and healing. The apparatus returns measurements of friction and stability of reference materials of F110 quartz consistent with the literature while additionally allowing the concurrent measurement of permeability. Permeability of F110 quartz evolves in slide-hold-slide (SHS) experiments with increases during holds and decreases during subsequent slides. These observations are consistent with grain crushing and resultant wear products that reduce that permeability by clogging during slides with unclogging of the major fluid channels occurring during shearing.\n               ","36":"\n                  Hydraulic fracturing has been a successful stimulation method for enhancing recovery in very low permeability shale gas reservoirs. Proper modeling of multistage hydraulic fracturing in shale reservoirs requires an accurate representation of the pre-existing natural fractures in the shale. The objective of this study is to utilize a 3D discrete fracture network model to simulate hydraulic fracturing in five horizontal wells A-E in the Barnett Shale. Each horizontal well had 10 stages of hydraulic fracturing stimulation. Only the well C has comprehensive logging data including an FMI (Formation Microresistivity Imager) log of the well. We characterize stochastic realizations pre-existing natural fracture network in the reservoir integrating different types of data from limited wellbore data to the geologic setting. Two fracture sets clustered using Fisher distribution after correcting for the observation biases. Fractures size constrained by induced microseismicity magnitude happened during hydraulic fracturing while fracture intensity correlated to clay contents (Gamma Ray) and distance from the fault crossing the well C.

The profile of minimum principal horizontal stress, Shmin, is constrained by hydraulic tests, but the magnitude of the maximum horizontal principal stress, SHmax is uncertain. Here we derive estimates for SHmax by analysing breakout width data from an acoustic televiewer logs run in the granitic basement section of the BS-1 borehole. Some 81% of the borehole in the granite is affected by breakouts. The approach employed to derive SHmax magnitude from the estimated breakout widths is taking into account all stress components at the borehole wall including the remnant thermal stress arising from the cooling of the borehole wall by the drilling. In BS-1, breakouts width tends to decrease with depth. Assuming there is no significant systematic change in the strength characteristics of the rock along the length of the hole, for which there is no evidence, the large-scale trend has the consequence of implying a small gradient of the SHmax profile. A low Shmin gradient was also implied by a stress analysis that additionally considered the occasionally coincident presence of drilling induced tension fractures. The absolute values of SHmax depend upon the failure criterion used. Criteria that consider the strengthening effect of the intermediate stress (Mogi-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown 3D) yield profiles that violate frictional limits on the strength of the crust above 4\u202fkm, whereas the profiles of the Mohr-Coulomb and Rankine criteria do not. The Mohr-Coulomb criteria profiles indicate a trend in SHmax from favoring strike-slip faulting above 4200\u202fm to strike-slip\/normal faulting below. This is consistent with focal mechanisms recorded during the reservoir stimulation which show a mix of strike-slip and normal faulting throughout the depth range considered.\n               ","38":"\n                  It is essential to quantify the ground motions induced by seismic events with different focal mechanisms in underground mine. To quantitatively calculate the induced ground motions, we expressed the motions as the convolution of the seismic source and the wave propagation path using seismological method. Firstly, we investigated the theoretical ground motion patterns using four idealized focal mechanisms. Results show that the pure compressional failure source and the pure tensional failure source induced the same ground motion patterns. The vibrations they induced attenuate extremely fast. The pure shear failure source shows closely azimuth related pattern with four quadrants around the source. The pure explosive failure source induces vibrations attenuating toward all directions away from the source. But the vibrations are not attenuated gradually with the increasing distance. Then, we investigated the ground motions under complicated focal mechanisms using recorded fault slip events, cavity collapse events, and tensional failure events. The fault slip events show a four quadrants ground motion distribution in the horizontal plane and a two quadrants distribution in the vertical plan. But the cavity collapse events show a two quadrants distribution in the horizontal plane and a four quadrants distribution in the vertical plane. It is concluded that the induced ground motion at a certain location is controlled by the dual effects of the azimuth and the source focal mechanism as well as the distance and the source magnitude.\n               ","39":"\n                  In this contribution we show the variation of the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and petrophysical properties of different architectural elements of fault zones affecting poorly lithified coarse sandstone and conglomerates of the Rio do Peixe basin, NE Brazil. We worked on three distinct outcrops; (1) non-deformed (protolith); (2) single fault zone, presenting moderate strain; and (3) complex fault zone, presenting a high strain intensity, where multiple and well developed fault cores occurs. To characterize the structural domains, we performed scanlines and uniaxial geomechanical survey across deformation bands and clustering zones. We combined geomechanical data with porosity data acquired thru image analysis and gas expansion analysis. We acquired data on deformation band cores and zones between deformation bands (i.e., deformed zones that do not present deformation bands). Our results show that the complex fault zone exhibits a strong increase on the rock resistance, thus presenting UCS values three times higher than those obtained on the single fault zone outcrop and four times higher when compared with the non-deformed outcrop. It suggests that there is a direct relation between strain and rock resistance. The porosity is also strongly affected by the deformation, exhibiting an inverse relation with the strain intensity. Complex fault zone presents up to 75% of porosity reduction, while single fault zone, only about 10% of reduction. The petrophysical properties were calculated in the complex fault zone, where the resistance of the DBs was as high as twice that of the zone without bands, which had effects on the Young\u2019s and the incompressibility\u2019s moduli. The results suggest that even though DBs generate up to a 40% increase in the UCS and a 75% decrease in the porosity, the structural domains where the rock is located strongly controls the geomechanical and petrophysical properties, thus, directly affecting the anisotropy of a reservoir.\n               ","40":"\n                  The initiation and development of fractures in rocks is the key part of many problems from academic to industrial, such as faulting, folding, rock mass engineering, reservoir characterization, etc. Conventional ways of evaluating the fracture historical deformations depend on the geologists\u2019 visual interpretation of indicating structures such as fault striations, fault steps, plumose structures, etc. on the fracture surface produced by previous deformations, and hence suffer from problems like subjectivity and the absence of obvious indicating structures. In this study, we propose a quantitative method to derive historical shear deformations of rock fractures from digital outcrop models (DOMs) based on the analysis of effects of fault striations and fault steps on the shear strength parameter of the fracture surface. A theoretical model that combines effects of fault striations, fault steps and isotropic base shear strength is fitted to the shear strength parameter. The amount of fault striations and fault steps and their occurrences are estimated, and the historical shear deformations can be inferred. The validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method was proved by testing it on a constructed fracture surface with idealized striations and a fracture surface with clear fault steps. The application of this method on an example outcrop shows an intuitive idea of how the rock mass was deformed and that the distribution, occurrence and mode of new fractures are strictly controlled by preexisting fractures, and hence emphasizes the importance of preexisting fractures in modeling the development of fracture systems.\n               ","41":"\n                  In natural rock masses, joints or flaws usually occur in sets that are more or less parallel and regularly spaced. Many problems occurred in tunnel engineering mainly result from the failure of joints or faults because they are weaker compared with the rock matrix. Therefore, it is important to study the interaction of joints with the tunnel, as well as the interactions between themselves. In this research, rock-like specimens of non-persistent jointed rock masses containing a circular hole are prepared and tested under uniaxial compression. The test results show that the peak strength and elastic modulus of the non-persistent jointed rock specimens display a \u201cU\u201d type variation with respect to the joint inclination. The multiple joints can be simplified and regarded as a combination of three types of two-joints relative location, and the crack coalescence types and failure modes are in accordance with the classic crack coalescence types of the two joints. The crack coalescence between the joints and a circular hole can be categorized into three modes with respect to the joint inclination. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) model of the jointed rock specimen that contains a circular hole is established in particle flow code 2D (PFC2D). The simulation results show a good agreement with the experiment results. Furthermore, the displacement fields at the crack zones reveal that the coalescence of joints is mainly caused by tensile cracks and that shear slipping cracks easily occur at the sidewalls of the circular hole. By comparing the parallel-bond force fields in jointed models containing a circular hole with no a circular hole, it is shown that the circular hole can change the stress state at the top and bottom. The joints at a joint inclination of 90\u00b0 have the smallest effect on the mechanical behavior of the rock specimen.\n               ","42":"\n                  Blasting process causes deleterious effects on a mine and affects stability and pace of production if not properly designed and controlled.

The situation gets grim in the mines, specially the open pits, traversed with numerous prominent geological structures like faults, shears, etc. The blast damage inflicted upon such geological structures is difficult to be measured by conventional techniques like mapping, drilling core, etc. because of in-accessibility rendered to these fault site due to blast damage. In order to investigate response of such geological faults to blast vibrations circumventing these problems, applicability of slope stability radar deployed at Rampura Agucha mine (RAM) for slope stability monitoring was extended to capture sliding movement of faults also. During the investigation, three faults situated on hang wall of the RAM open pit were monitored for sliding movement caused by a number of blasts (20\u221230) carried out in their vicinity while the corresponding level of blast vibrations generated was calculated by predictor equation established in the area.\n                  Analysis of the instant observations revealed a definite threshold value of ground vibrations triggering the fault sliding across all the three experiments depicting consistency of the investigation. Secondly, with rise of level of ground vibrations, the magnitude of sliding movement increases linearly with varying degree of correlation.

A commercially available distinct element code with its explicit time-stepping scheme is adopted for modeling the initial quasi-static and the subsequent dynamic response of rock burst in compression and shear. Ground reaction curves are introduced to discuss criteria for stability of a failure through stress analyses. Energy balance equations are analyzed for assessing the rock burst intensity by estimating radiated seismic energy once conditions of instability emerge. Two methods are discussed for estimating radiated seismic energy: tracking of the energy conversion during failure; recording the kinetic energy that is damped by mechanical damping schemes. Modeling approach and methodologies for studying compressive-type rock burst are developed and calibrated against available analytical solutions with respect to radiated seismic energy and excavation convergence. Factors participating in the intensity of rock burst in compression are examined by modeling a rectangular tabular excavation supported by a single pillar with ductile, semi-brittle, and brittle failure responses under different compressive loading. A shear-type rock burst along a strike-slip fault model is simulated and modeling approach is calibrated by checking the resulting slip distribution, radiated seismic energy, and seismic moment against analytical solutions. Factors contributing to the occurrence and intensity of shear-type rock burst are explored by simulating different slip scenarios under different loading conditions. With presented analyses, this paper provides a computational framework calibrated for studying rock burst events and, as a reference for treatment of more complex cases, shows how Young's modulus of the rock, failure stress drop, rock brittleness, and slip-weakening behaviors of faults govern the rock burst occurrence and intensity.\n               ","44":"\n                  Mining operations in the Schlema-Alberoda uranium mine located in south-west Saxony (Germany) stopped in 1990, and the mine was then allowed to flood. The region is seismically active and has been monitored for a long time. We have located some of the microseismic events which occurred between 2005 and 2012 in the mining area to investigate the nature of the seismicity, as well as the long-term role of mining-induced and triggered seismicity. In this study, we used pseudo-synthetic data obtained from the vertical component records of a local seismic network, to accurately locate the hypocenters. The location procedure is based on a Kirchhoff Prestack Depth Migration approach. In order to assess the accuracy of the migration results, a homogeneous and a 3-D velocity model are tested in the migration algorithm. Both of these velocity models were previously used to migrate data acquired by a 3-D reflection seismic survey in this area. The resulting images were comparable, with minor differences to the reflectors in our area of interest. In contrast, we found that the errors in the velocity model can strongly affect the migration-based earthquake localization. The located hypocenters are compared to the 3-D reflection seismic image of the area to determine possible correlations between the seismicity and reflectivity. This comparison shows that some of reflectors can be directly correlated with the induced and triggered seismicity of the area. The results also indicate that the main causes of the post-mining seismicity are changes in the mine flooding level and the consequent changes in the pore pressure of the subsurface structures. Finally, we confirm that the hypocenters are often bound to preexisting subsurface structures like faults and fractures in the area. In particular, the spatial pattern of the hypocenters proves the existence of a previously unmapped extension of the Ruhmvoll fault. This pattern also suggests a connection between this structure and the Roter Kamm fault, a major component of the larger Gera-J\u00e0chymov fault zone.\n               ","45":"\n                  Fault heterogeneities such as bumps, bends, and stepovers are commonly observed on natural faults, but are challenging to recreate under controlled laboratory conditions.

An idealized asperity is added by emplacing a precision-ground 21\u202fmm-diameter solid granite dowel that crosses the center of the fault at right angles. This intact granite \u2018pin\u2019 provides a strength contrast that resists fault slip. Upon loading to 80\u202fMPa in a triaxial machine, we first observed a M -4 slip event that ruptured the sawcut fault, slipped 40\u202f\u00b5m, but was halted by the granite pin. With continued loading, the pin failed in a swarm of thousands of M -6 to M\u00a0-8 events known as acoustic emissions (AEs). Once the pin was fractured to a critical point, it permitted complete rupture events (M -3) on the sawcut fault (stick-slip instabilities). Subsequent slip events were preceded by clusters of foreshock-like AEs, all located on the fault plane, and the spatial extent of the foreshock clusters is consistent with our estimate of a critical nucleation dimension h*. We also identified an aseismic zone on the fault plane surrounding the fractured rock pin. A post-mortem analysis of the sample showed a thick gouge layer where the pin intersected the fault, suggesting that dilatancy of this gouge propped open the fault and prevented microseismic events in its vicinity. Recorded microseismicity separates into three categories: slip on the sawcut fault, fracture of the intact rock pin, and off-fault seismicity associated with pin-related rock joints. We found that pin fracture events were exclusively implosive (anticrack) even though the shear process zone was overall dilatant. This shows how aseismic effects can lead to unexpected seismic manifestations of certain faulting processes.\n               ","46":"\n                  The true triaxial test, which can simulate in-situ stress fields of nature which have different scalar quantity along three principal axes of stress, is the most effective experimental method for obtaining the mechanical and permeability property of rocks under overburden and tectonic stresses. The intermediate principal stress (\u03c32) is a control on the fracture strength, mechanical behavior and crack distribution of the deformed rocks. Thus, understanding the effect of the stress on the development of permeability anisotropy is crucial. To evaluate the influence of the \u03c32 on the permeability anisotropy, the permeability measurement lines in the \u03c31 and \u03c32 directions were added into an upgraded Mogi-type true triaxial test apparatus. We measured the permeability of Berea sandstone and Amatsu mudstone in the \u03c31 and \u03c32 direction under the conditions of true triaxial compression (\u03c33 < \u03c32 < \u03c31) with a constant \u03c33. In the Berea sandstone, we found that the permeability reduced with increasing mean stress and the magnitude of permeability anisotropy correlated with the intermediate principal stress. Photomicrographs and X-ray computed tomography observations for post-failure Berea sandstones revealed a phenomenon related to permeability: under high \u03c32 conditions, the fault gouge generated along final fractures causes permeability reduction of \u03c31 direction. For the Amatsu mudstone is too soft to be subject to brittle deformation.

Shearing and the corresponding displacement caused by rock shearing and fault activation during hydraulic fracturing may enhance proppant embedment, and the influence may vary under different fluid and joint roughness conditions. Rock shear performance is worthy of study as it has an important role in the development of proppant embedment. In this study, a direct shear machine is utilized under constant normal load, and proppant embedment and rock shear strength are recorded by transducers with increasing rock horizontal displacement. Based on the experimental results, rock shearing has a detrimental effect on proppant embedment, and proppant embedment increases almost linearly with increasing horizontal displacement. Fluid affects proppant embedment by altering the interaction between the proppant and the rock mass, and fluid with high viscosity helps improve proppant embedment by maintaining even proppant distribution, especially for rock shearing along undulating surfaces. Rock shear strength, associated with rock friction angles, decreases with the addition of proppant. The addition of proppant also greatly alters rock dilatancy, enhancing rock dilation angle reduction through a large amount of proppant embedment. The reduction of rock shear resistance is believed to be a threat to proppant behaviour.

Therefore the failure process starts close to the injection well, where the pore pressure is the highest, and propagates away from the well as more fluid reaches the tip of the damage zone.

The calculated equivalent permeability with varying shear displacement of the fault is compared with that of in-situ measurements in the Wenchuan earthquake fault zone. Based on the best-fitted shear displacement, the closure of fault aperture over time in the post-earthquake stage is calculated and presented. We define a dimensionless permeability and a dimensionless aperture that is the ratio of permeability\/aperture at a certain shear displacement and a certain depth to their original values recorded after an initial earthquake. Our analysis suggests that the dimensionless permeability decreases over time following linear functions, while the dimensionless aperture decreases following quadratic functions in the post-earthquake stage. The ranges of dimensionless permeability increment during an earthquake and reduction afterward are approximately twice of those of dimensionless aperture increment and reduction, respectively. The results revealed an increasing manner of closure rates of the fault in each post-earthquake stage, which cannot be effectively accommodated by previous experimental observations and theoretical\/numerical models that generally obtain decreasing closure rates over time.

This study attempts to investigate quantitatively the effect of mineral cement and particle dissolution through numerical modeling and validation of triaxial tests performed on unaltered and geologically altered Entrada Sandstone. We utilize a numerical model that couples the discrete element method (DEM) and the bonded-particle model (BPM) to perform simulations of triaxial tests on synthetic rocks that mimic tested rock samples under various confining stresses. Numerical results, in agreement with experimental evidence, show that both cement and particle dissolution significantly contribute to rock weakening in sandstone samples with carbonate\/hematite cements and pore-filling carbonate. Sensitivity analyses show that the brittleness of DEM numerical samples is mostly conditioned by the cement bond size among all cement microscopic parameters. An alteration path that mimics the mineral dissolution under subsurface boundary conditions leads to (1) vertical compaction and horizontal stress relaxation in the reservoir rock and (2) transfer of stresses to adjacent strata that results in bond breakage and potentially natural fracture reactivation at a large scale.\n               ","52":"\n                  To discriminate the type of the induced seismicity in the underground mine, full waveform inversion and statistical methods were used to investigate the different microseismic source mechanisms in a more quantitative way.

Firstly, the expected prior probability functions for mining blast, cavity collapse, fault slip, and tensional failure were defined, which are related to the percentage of the double couple, the compensated linear vector dipole, and the isotropic components. Secondly, the likelihood of a given candidate event to a certain source model was calculated, and the source type was determined according to the moment tensor decomposition of the case with the highest probability density. Tests with synthetic datasets were performed to evaluate the stability of the inversion in case of poor data quality and inaccurate source location.

Meanwhile, a comprehensive evaluation function expressed by the sum of dilution and loss rates of bauxite was utilized to determine the optimal cutting heights (1.71\u20132.69\u202fm) and a suitable diameter (1.5\u202fm) for the cutting drums mounted on a double-drum shearer to achieve no-waste and high-recovery mining of the demarcated 106,026\u202fm3 bauxite orebody. In addition, a numerical model of strata containing geological defects (a karst cave and fault), discontinuities (joints and stratifications) and a mountain was established to simulate the discontinuous motion and overburden fracturing disturbed by the longwall mining in the modelled bauxite seam. The results indicated that the overburden presented reliable stability and impermeability, in which no large-scale caving in goaf, no water influx, no cave collapse, no fault slip, and no mountain slope landslide occurred.

The mechanism of formation and preservation of pore structures in fault-zone fractures can be explained by local shear-induced tensile stresses, and pore structures in discrete shear fractures may form in the same way. I investigated, therefore, whether the DI model can correctly predict the highest transmissivities of shear fractures recorded in fractured Neogene diatomaceous mudstone (Koetoi Formation), where fault zones and joints are rare but discrete shear fractures, without mineral fillings, are abundant. Analyses of the shear fractures reveal that the detected states of paleostress are nearly equal to the current stress state, implying the shear fractures have potentially been tectonically active. Thus, the highest transmissivities detected at fractures by flowing-fluids electric conductivity (FFEC) borehole logging may potentially be treated as the highest potential transmissivities in terms of the given DIs.

We employed a multi-scale modeling approach in which the CO2 injection was simulated in a large-scale model of reservoir and the results were then exported into a micro-scale model of the fault shear zone which incorporates the TP effect. A poroelasticity finite element model was created in the large-scale model to determine the stress and pressure changes in the reservoir and within the fault zone during CO2 injection. The fault slip, pressure, and stresses obtained from the large-scale model were fed into the small-scale model to define hydraulic and mechanical boundary conditions of the shear zone of the fault. Two small-scale models were developed to compare the response of the fault shear zone with and without considering the TP. For the model with the TP effect, a simple constitutive law was implemented to couple pore pressure changes with temperature rise due to frictional heating. The results indicated that, in general, TP can lead to a significant increase of pore pressure build up due to CO2 injection. The effects of hydraulic diffusivity, slip velocity, shear zone thickness as well as injection rate on pore pressure, temperature and fracture energy prediction were evaluated. It was found that temperature and pore pressure rise decrease significantly by decreasing the slip velocity and increasing the shear zone thickness. For the values which were examined, hydraulic diffusivity was found to have insignificant effect on pore pressure and temperature changes which can be attributed to high compressibility of CO2.

The calliper surveys were depth shifted against the open-hole reference depth used in Geoscience to accurately identify the interfaces along which the deformations occur. The deformations have been found to be distributed at the top of the Fulmar Formation reservoir, in the Late Jurassic shales, in the Early Cretaceous Cromer Knoll Group, and the Late Cretaceous Chalk Group. For each deformation feature, the relative displacement of the well was estimated using the calliper tool eccentricity resulting from the movement of the toolstring through the kink in the pipe. Maximum relative displacements were estimated at 3.7in. in the 7in. liner and at 1.2in. in the 9 7\/8in. production casing. The analysis of the calliper surveys show that the deformation features result from slip displacements along various discontinuities such as bedding planes, reservoir faults extending in the overburden, and overburden faults.

The AE characteristics were analysed, and a method based on the AE b-value was developed to predict stress drops and the fault-slip rockbursts induced by the stress drops. The b-value continuously decreased before the stress drop and dropped to approximately 0.8 or less at the point of the violent post-peak shear stress drop. Moreover, the b-value tended to decrease to a relative minimum during the stick-slip period when the energy increased sharply if the energy rate was greater than 104, and a lower b-value was associated with a higher rockburst probability and intensity. The b-value generally decreased as the normal stress increased, which increased the risk of rockburst induced by the dynamic shear failure of granite joints.

To date, few studies have assessed the potential role of the DZ characteristics (anisotropy, complex spatial distribution, etc.) on the shear behavior of the whole system, the main challenge being the proper (numerical) integration of fracture networks in reservoir simulators.

We propose here a methodology relying on homogenization techniques for deriving the spatial distribution of effective anisotropic hydro-poro-elastic DZ properties from these stochastic fracture networks. Using them as inputs of 2D finite-element coupled hydro-mechanical models of a reservoir-scale fault zone, the key role of the spatially-varying DZ stiffness and Biot's coefficients are highlighted: neglecting them might lead to a high over-estimation of the maximum sustainable injection pressure (by nearly 50% in the considered cases).\n               ","62":"","63":"\n                  This study presents an investigation of the excavation damaged zone (EDZ) around roadways under dynamic pressure during longwall mining.

The results of the investigation indicate that the EDZ width around roadways under dynamic pressure was larger than those under static pressure due to mining-induced disturbance and the effect of unstable overlying rocks in adjacent goaf. The existence of faults and other adverse geological conditions can also contribute to the expansion of EDZs. The findings were incorporated in designing a more appropriate roadway support system. If the width of EDZ is larger than the bolt length, then the employment of bolts alone will not be sufficient to maintain roadway stability. Reinforcement with cables must be added to the support system. The reason is that cables have an overhanging effect and can be anchored in the excavation influenced zone (EIZ) which is adjacent to the EDZ in stable surrounding rock masses.

It is widely recognized that dynamic behaviour of fault-slip is largely affected by slip-weakening behaviour. In the present study, the effect of the slip-weakening behaviour on selected seismic source parameters of fault-slip is investigated using a mine-wide numerical model encompassing a fault running parallel to an orebody. A linear slip-weakening law is employed in a parametrical study with respect to characteristic slip-weakening distance, d\n                     0, assuming two types of fault-slip: (a) zonal fault-slip taking place across the fault; (b) local fault-slip taking place within limited areas of the fault, i.e., it is assumed that fault-slip is arrested by surrounding rockmasses. Results obtained from the dynamic analysis indicate that seismically radiated energy and slip rates are significantly affected by d\n                     0 for both types of fault-slip. On the other hand, the seismic moment is susceptible to d\n                     0 only for zonal fault-slip, given that d\n                     0 is smaller than the maximum shear displacement increment during the fault-slip.

The model we developed was calibrated by comparing the simulated THM responses to field observations, including ground-surface deformations, well pressure, and microseismic activity. Of particular importance was the comparison between the observed temporal and spatial distribution of microseismic activity, and the calculated shear reactivation of preexisting fractures inferred from simulated elasto-plastic mechanical responses in the short fault zones. Using this approach, we could identify when fault zones were reactivated (as manifested in the field by a surge of local microseismic activity within the fault zone), and we could back-calculate the in situ stress field as being close to the stress conditions required for shear reactivation. Our results show that the main mechanisms of inducing seismicity are related to injection-induced pressure increase and cooling. During injection, the reservoir expansion caused by the pressure increase led to mechanical stress transfer through the reservoir, which prevented or delayed the reactivation of preexisting fractures. After injection stopped, there was an inversion of the mechanical stress transfers that favored shear reactivation, which may explain why microseismic activity occurred after the cessation of the injection.\n               ","69":"\n                  The design of an underground hydroelectric power scheme in northern Portugal has required the characterisation of the local stress field. Nineteen hydraulic tests have been conducted in two, 500m deep, vertical boreholes. In addition twelve overcoring tests together with twelve flat jack tests have been performed from an existing adit located some 1.7km away from the location of the hydraulic tests. Results have been integrated into a stress model that takes into account both topography and tectonics effects. Most of the data are consistent with a linearly elastic, gravity loaded model, provided a very soft geomaterial is considered. This implies that the stress field in this granite rock mass is controlled by gravity alone and shear stress relaxation along faults and fractures but is unaffected by present-day tectonics.\n               ","70":"\n                  We review ten historical Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) projects and find that typically, during injection: (1) flow from the wellbore is from preexisting fractures, (2) bottomhole pressure exceeds the minimum principal stress, and (3) pressure-limiting behavior occurs. These observations are apparently contradictory because (1) is consistent with shear stimulation, but (2) and (3) suggest propagation of new fractures. To reconcile these observations, we propose that, in many cases, new fractures do not form at the wellbore, but away from the wellbore, and new fractures initiate from open and\/or sliding natural fractures and propagate through the formation. Fracture initiation from natural fractures is aided by concentrations of stress caused by the fractures\u05f3 opening and sliding. The propagating fractures may terminate against natural fractures, forming a complex network of both new and preexisting fractures. We perform computational modeling with a discrete fracture network simulator that couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation. The modeling results demonstrate that several geological conditions must be in place for stimulation to occur only through induced slip on preexisting fractures and to avoid significant opening of new or preexisting fractures. These conditions cannot be expected to be present at every EGS project, and our review of the literature shows that they typically are not. The simulation results indicate that pure shear stimulation is more likely to be possible in locations with thick faults present, and our review of the literature shows that EGS field experience is consistent with this hypothesis. We discuss field experiences from several EGS projects and describe how they are consistent with the idea that significant propagation of new fractures has occurred.\n               ","71":"\n                  This preliminary investigation into carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in a Brazilian offshore oil field has the objective of assessing the potential risk of caprock failure for CO2 geological storage in deep aquifers. The technical evaluation of a carbon storage site requires the sustainable pore pressure to be defined. CO2 injection into a hydrocarbon reservoir or aquifer alters the stress locally and also in the surrounding rocks. This brings with it the risk of geological fault reactivation, which would create a likely path for the escape of CO2 to other rock layers, or even to the surface. Several methodologies have been developed to estimate fault reactivation pressures; however, even the most sophisticated solutions depend on data reliability. The aim of this study was to investigate the loss of caprock integrity due to fault reactivation by geological carbon sequestration in a real aquifer using a probabilistic approach that considers the variation of the material properties and the initial stress state. The probabilistic response of the model was evaluated using the integrated nonlinear finite element simulator AEEPEC2D\u00ae and NESSUS\u00ae probabilistic analysis software. The random variables in the probabilistic model are the average effective vertical stress gradient, elastic modulus, Poisson\u05f3s ratio, the lateral earth pressure coefficient, and the cohesion, friction angle and thickness of the fault. The uncertainties in the properties both rock layers and faults were incorporated into the analysis using the mean value and advanced mean value plus methods. Geomechanical 2D finite element models of the formation were developed to evaluate the stress changes associated with pore pressure variation in cases where an induced fault slippage would be a threat to the integrity of the seal. The proposed methodology was applied to three realistic geological sections with several faults cutting the aquifer. The cumulative distribution curve of maximum admissible pore pressure variation was derived. In addition, the most influential variables for each fault were identified.\n               ","72":"\n                  This study describes a systematic analysis of breakout occurrence, variation of breakout orientation and fracture characteristics.

Breakout orientation anomalies are found to concentrate in the immediate vicinity of fault cores and to decrease with distance to the fault core. Patterns of breakout orientation in the vicinity of natural fractures suggest that the breakout rotation, relative to the mean S\n                     \n                        hmin\n                      direction, is strongly influenced by the fracture orientation. Even a direct relationship between fracture and breakout orientations is found in some depth intervals. In highly fractured zones, with different fracture families present, breakout orientations are especially heterogeneous, resulting from the overlapping effects of the fracture network. Additionally, breakouts are typically found to be asymmetrical in zones with high fracture density. Borehole breakout heterogeneities do not seem to be related to the principal stress heterogeneity only, but also to the effect of mechanical heterogeneities like weak zones with different elastic moduli, rock strength and fracture patterns. Consequently, care has to be taken when inferring the principal stress orientation from borehole breakout data observed in fractured rock.\n               ","73":"\n                  We present the description of a fully coupled simulator FEHM for modeling coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes in geomedia.

The simulator is designed to address spatial scales on the order of tens of centimeters to tens of kilometers, and time scales on the order of hours to tens of years. The governing coupled nonlinear equations are solved using a Newton\u2013Rapshon scheme with analytically or numerically computed Jacobians. A suite of models is available for coupling flow and mechanical deformation via permeability\u2013deformation relationships. The coupled simulator is verified by comparing with several analytical solutions developed for this purpose. A subset of the simulator capabilities is benchmarked against commercially available simulators. We also demonstrate a good match with data from Desert Peak geothermal field in Nevada, USA.

However, in practice, the infill materials are often partially saturated generating matric suction within the joint that can contribute to increased shear strength. To the authors\u2019 knowledge this is the first study to examine the influence of compacted (unsaturated) infill on the joint shear strength. A series of laboratory triaxial tests on idealised model joints and imprinted natural joint profiles was carried out, with constant water contents of the infill being maintained. From the laboratory results, it is observed that the peak shear strength of infilled joints increased with the decrease of degree of saturation from 85% to 35% for both idealised joints and replicated natural joints. Based on the laboratory observations an empirical model for describing the infilled joint shear strength was developed.\n               ","75":"\n                  An investigation is made of the characteristic strata movement and mechanism underlying fault\u2013pillar induced rock bursts (FPIRBs) in order to mitigate rock burst damage in fault areas. A mechanical analysis of the fault\u2013pillar model is established and roof rotation criteria is obtained. A formula is derived for the average static stress in the pillar through theoretical analysis, physical simulations, and engineering practice. The results show that when a coalface approaches a fault area, two or more roof strata simultaneously fracture in the fault area, leading to an increase in the dynamic and static stresses in the pillar. The most important factors affecting FPIRB are the static stress in the pillar and the dynamic stress induced by fault slides. The roof block rotates more easily when the pillar width is smaller, the roof thickness larger, and the roof subsidence smaller. The average static stress in the pillar increases with decreasing pillar width and\/or increasing roof fracture length. The stress is greater if there is a voussoir beam structure, in which case the stress is directly proportional to the squared length of the fractured roof, and inversely proportional to the squared width of the pillar just before rotation occurs. After rotation, it is directly proportional to the roof fracture length and inversely proportional to the pillar width. Based on the FPIRB mechanism and analysis of the mechanical model, six methods of FPIRB prevention are proposed. Also, we find that FPIRB occurrence can be effectively reduced by the use of de-stress blasting and large diameter drilling.\n               ","76":"\n                  Fontainebleau sandstone specimens have been tested in a true-triaxial geophysical imaging cell under hydrostatic (\u03c3\n                     1\n                     =\u03c3\n                     2\n                     =\u03c3\n                     3), traditional triaxial (\u03c3\n                     1\n                     =\u03c3\n                     2>\u03c3\n                     3) and true-triaxial (\u03c3\n                     1> \u03c3\n                     2>\u03c3\n                     3) stress regimes.

Based on the results obtained from the numerical analyses, seismic source parameters are calculated and compared for each case. The results show that faults having rough surfaces tend to cause much larger seismic events than faults with smooth surfaces. In addition, parametrical study with respect to fault-surface roughness shows that seismic moment and radiated energy significantly vary with the fault-surface roughness and the seismic moment does not necessarily correlate with the radiated energy. Peak particle velocity excited by seismic waves arising from the simulated fault-slips is also examined. It is found out from the results that peak particle velocity is strongly dependent upon the fault surface roughness and has a correlation with the radiated energy, but not with seismic moment.\n               ","78":"\n                  We evaluated the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) in detecting karst cavities and discontinuities that could form potential landslide surfaces in flyschoid rocks of the Rode\u017e open pit mine in Anhovo (W Slovenia).

This overpressure may induce microseismic events if the rock yields. Yielding of the caprock could open up a leakage path for CO2. Rock mechanical integrity is strongly related to fluid pressure evolution, which is significantly different for vertical and horizontal wells. While CO2 pressure builds up sharply at the beginning of injection, but afterwards drops, when injecting a constant CO2 mass flow rate through a vertical well, a horizontal well leads to a continuous CO2 pressure increase. Thus, for a vertical well, the less stable situation in the saline aquifer occurs at the beginning of injection. However, the changes induced in the effective stress field are small, so unstable conditions are unlikely both in a normal faulting and a reverse faulting stress regimes in extensive saline aquifers such as the one considered in this study. By contrast, fluid pressure becomes larger than that of a vertical well for a common length of horizontal wells (around 2km), which causes a significant increase in horizontal total stresses that improves the reservoir and caprock mechanical stability in a NF stress regime, but worsens it in a RF stress regime. Though in general the caprock integrity is unlikely to be compromised, fluid pressure evolution should be always monitored and mitigation measures should be carried out if it deviates from its expected evolution.\n               ","80":"\n                  A model of the Ventersdorp Contact Reef (VCR) orebody at Kloof Gold Mine was derived by integrating 3D reflection seismic data with information derived from underground mine mapping and exploration drilling.

The 3D seismic data provide an accurate geometric model of the VCR orebody and its offsets. The underground mapping datasets help to define minor faults and dikes that are below seismic resolution limits. The integration of the these datasets allowed (1) for better mapping of fault architectures and distributions within the lease area, (2) definition of the likely zones of difficult ground conditions around seismically imaged dikes and faults, and (3) better predictions of the number and spacing of faults that offset the VCR within minable blocks.

The results obtained from the analyses show that the maximum dynamic shear displacement increment induced by stope extraction is significantly affected by the friction angle of the fault, as well as mining depth and position of fault with respect to the orebody, while the stiffness and the dilation angle of the fault do not have as much influence. Seismic source parameters are computed based on the numerical results and as is the case with the maximum relative shear displacements, the position and friction angle of the fault appear to have the strongest influence on seismic moment and energy released by fault slip. The limitations of Mohr\u2013Coulomb criterion as applied to the dynamic analysis of fault slip bursts are discussed in light of the results obtained. Lastly, slip rates and rupture velocity are investigated. The results show that the maximum slip rates are associated with the maximum increments of relative dynamic shear displacement.

This model addresses the effects of the diffuse fluid pressure increase, and is useful for engineered applications such as the injection of fluid into a reservoir that may cause an increase of fluid pressure beneath a caprock, and for sedimentary sequences during normal digenetic processes of burial and fault activation. Analytical and numerical elastic stress strain solutions are compared to provide a robust normalised standard relationship for predicting the spacing of fractures.

Strength and Young\u2019s modulus increase with increasing confining stress and permeability is hysteretic in the initial reversible deformation regime. As deviatoric stress and strain increase, permeability first decreases as pre-existing cleats close, and then increases as new vertical dilatant microcracks are generated. Post-peak strength the permeability suddenly increases by 3\u20134 orders-of-magnitude. During loading, the inflection point where permeability begins to increase occurs earlier than the turning point of volumetric strain, which may be explained by the competing processes of axial crack opening and closure of oblique and transverse cracks.

Due to this redistribution, the zone closest to the mining-face may experience tensile failure. Interior to this zone a region may develop with gas overpressures induced by desorption and this may contribute to the occurrence of coal and gas outbursts. Beyond this, an overstressed zone may initiate shear failure driven by gas pressures if the desorption rate outstrips the rate of drainage.

Flow anisotropy is investigated under various applied stresses and matrix permeabilities. In-situ stress conditions that encourage a closing of fractures together with a more pervasive matrix-dominated flow are identified. These are compared with conditions supporting more localised flow where fractures are prone to dilatational shearing and can be more easily exploited by fluids. The natural fracture geometries modelled in this work are not perfectly straight, promoting fracture segments that dilate as they shear. We have demonstrated the introduction of several realistic processes that have an influence on natural systems: fractures can propagate with wing cracks; there is the potential for new fractures to connect with existing fractures, thus increasing the connectivity and flow; blocks can rotate when bounded by fractures, bent fractures lead to locally different aperture development; highly heterogeneous stress distributions emerge naturally.

Fresh intact samples from surface outcrops yielded a similar range of permeabilities as did intact samples from drill cores, within lithological variations. Comparison of laboratory and in-situ measurements has revealed that the permeability of Wakkanai Formation (middle to late Miocene, siliceous mudstone) from in-situ measurements is bounded by the permeability of brecciated specimen on the upper side and by the permeability of intact specimens on the lower side. Fragments in fault breccia are smaller than sample size and laboratory data should be applicable to natural fault rocks. Permeability of fractured specimens falls in between those upper and lower bounds, and complex scale issues will not be important in determining upper and lower bounds of permeability. The hydraulic conductivity values from in situ tests for Koetoi Formation (late Miocene to Pliocene, diatomaceous mudstone) are similar to those of the gas permeability of intact specimens. Effects of faults and fractures on permeability seems to be minor for this formation, and this was confirmed by permeability measurements with fractured samples. The hydraulic conductivity values from in situ tests for Yuchi Formation are lower than estimates from laboratory tests by within an order of magnitude.

From the acoustic survey data, which required a high energy acoustic source to emit high frequency signals (21, 25, 31 and 38kHz), the rock mass was observed to be anisotropic and heterogeneous at the scale of the experiment. P-wave velocities were determined to be, in average, between 3300m\/s along a structural bedding plane, and 2700m\/s at \n                        \u03b8\n                        \u2243\n                        70\n                        \u00b0\n                      incidence relative to that. Assuming a transversely isotropic shale formation, the P-wave velocity dependence versus \n                        \u03b8\n                      was modeled using Thomsen's Weak Transverse Isotropy model (Thomsen, 1986) [36]. Thomsen's P-wave anisotropy parameter was found to be \n                        \u03f5\n                        \u2243\n                        0.15\n                     , and the fifth Thomsen's parameter controlling the deviation of the wave front from an ellipsoidal geometry was found to be \n                        \u03b4\n                        \u2243\n                        0.16\n                     . The S-wave velocity was estimated along a single direction of aligned receivers and turned out to be around 1560m\/s at \n                        \u03b8\n                        \u2243\n                        30\n                        \u00b0\n                     . We also show that the rock mass acts as a frequency filter for acoustic waves, related to the rock mass heterogeneities, i.e. the inter-bedding structure, which induces wave scattering and refraction. From the micro-seismicity data, we identified a large number of micro-seismic events (MSEs) detected on the acoustic arrays during and following the excavation. Most of the MSEs were induced on the excavated face but we also located some MSEs inside the rock mass itself. We show that these events are located close to a major fault, which seems to be reactivated by the excavation process.\n               ","93":"\n                  Hydrocarbon production, \n                        \n                           \n                              CO\n                           \n                           \n                              2\n                           \n                        \n                      subsurface sequestration, and gas storage in exhausted reservoirs are a few anthropogenic activities involving the extraction or injection of fluids underground.

The geomechanical parameters needed to simulate and predict the above processes can also be indirectly inferred by Interferometric Synthetic Apertur Radar (InSAR)-based techniques that are used to monitor the land surface displacements. In the present study, the InSAR measurements above two exhausted fields of the Po River plain, Italy, presently employed for seasonal gas storage, are used to develop, set up, and calibrate a transversely isotropic geomechanical model of the porous medium. It is shown that only assuming transverse isotropy allows for a satisfactory reproduction of both the vertical and horizontal displacements that cannot be simultaneously matched by a simpler isotropic model. Moreover, similar parameters prove correct for both the reservoirs, located about 30km apart, providing evidence of the regional range of the above model applicability.\n               ","94":"\n                  We present the recent results of our work which is concerned with the determination of the spatial locations of faults, fractures and heterogeneities around a tunnel by advanced seismic imaging techniques.\n                  So far we have extended existing 2D imaging techniques to 3D.

The 3D P- and S-velocity models required for the calculation of the Green's functions have been generated by using the 2D first-break tomography velocity models and rotating them around the tunnel axis. The 3D images were obtained by stacking the migrated data taking into account either the true phase or the absolute value.\n                  The application of the mentioned imaging techniques to data from the Gotthard Base Tunnel (Piora adit) shows significant improvements compared to standard (KPSDM) processing. The 3D RIS approach suppresses scattering effects in the low frequency band and increases resolution in the high frequency band so that some of the geological structures are much better visible. The 3D FVM technique uses slowness and polarization based estimates of the emergence angles at the receivers and restricts the imaging to the region around the actual reflection or diffraction point. We observe less spatial ambiguity and a higher resolution of most structures.\n                  The integration of both approaches (RIS and FVM) exploits their advantages and delivers an even more pronounced and clear image of the tunnel environment.\n               ","95":"","96":"\n                  A new type of direct shear apparatus has been developed to allow for deformation of large and intact rock samples under fluid-sealed conditions. The sealed cell was specifically designed to monitor changes to fluid flow across the evolving rupture surface to large displacements (\u2264120mm), and effective stress conditions up to 36MPa. To maintain a seal for the pore fluid during deformation, a viscous and immiscible sealant fluid was injected at the interface between the rock specimen and the inner sample cell. Finite element modelling was conducted in parallel to verify the stress distribution in the specimen, notably the effect of geometrical constraints on the fault zone development and mechanical data.

The brittleness variation in this case follows a typical pattern of initially increasing, reaching a maximum and then ultimately decreasing. The harder the rock, the greater is the effect of embrittlement. A shear rupture mechanism discussed in the paper shows that the embrittlement results from reduction of friction within the rupture zone with rising confining stress. Transient \u201cnegative friction\u201d, which can be generated within a certain range of confining stress renders rocks superbrittle. The similarity in variation of rock brittleness with confining stress, and aftershock activity with depth, leads to the supposition that the aftershock process can be caused by generation of new faults in the intact rock mass surrounding the main fault where superbrittle behaviour determines the depth range of earthquake activity.\n               ","98":"\n                  This paper focuses on the stress field that produced a fault system in the Horonobe area of Japan, and considers the relationship between the fault system and the rock mass response to shaft excavation in soft sedimentary rocks.

Slope instability and rockfalls are the most frequent instability problems that may be encountered at tunnel portals. Such instability problems can be triggered by dynamic effects such as earthquakes, blasting, etc. This study investigates the stability of the portals of the Dorukhan Tunnel connecting the provinces of Zonguldak and Bolu in the close vicinity of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), which is a well-known strike-slip 1500km long fault. The effect of an earthquake that may occur in the NAFZ on the extent of failure has also been studied by numerical analyses. In the analyses, a three-dimensional dynamic analysis computer code, based on the finite difference method, has been used. According to results of the dynamic numerical analyses, the Devrek portal was found to be more stable than the Mengen portal. Moreover, it was found that, for acceleration values of dynamic wave higher than 0.5g, tunnel portal slopes and the areas as far as 20\u201350m from the tunnel entrance may suffer serious damage. Wave propagation perpendicular to the tunnel axis was established to cause more damage around the openings and in the portal slopes as wave compared to propagation parallel to the tunnel axis.\n               "},"Text":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nDuring the past three decades, extensive studies have been undertaken at Sweden on safe geological disposal of high-level, long-lived radioactive waste generated from nuclear power plants. The Forsmark area situated 120\u00a0km north to Stockholm is chosen by Svensk K\u00e4rnbr\u00e4nslehantering AB (SKB) as a suitable site for developing a KBS-3 repository at a depth of around 500\u00a0m in the crystalline basement.\n1\n The planned KBS-3 repository is based on a multi-barrier concept such that spent fuel is stored in copper-shelled iron canisters which are emplaced in deposition holes and isolated from the surrounding granite by high-density bentonite clay buffers.\n1\n The safety assessment of the KBS-3 repository needs to cover up to one million years because the radioactivity persists for a very long period of time.\nThe Forsmark site is located in Fennoscandian Shield (also called Baltic Shield), which is associated with low seismic activity in the present day.\n2\n However, the future occurrence of larger earthquakes in this region has to be expected and one or two seismic events with a moment magnitude \u22655 within a 5\u00a0km radius around the repository should occur during the one million year assessment period.\n1\n\n,\n\n3\n Such earthquakes may be triggered by deglaciation processes,\n4\u20136\n during which significant coseismic slips on secondary fractures (e.g. joints and faults) may occur and jeopardise the safety of waste canisters.\n7\n It is considered that a canister fails when the induced shear dislocation exceeds 5\u00a0cm1 as a result of e.g. the sliding of a natural fracture that cross-cuts the deposition hole. This 5\u00a0cm threshold is based on an integrated experimental and numerical evaluation of the capability of buffer and canister to withstand external shear loads.\n1\n Thus, it is crucial to understand and quantify the potential coseismic behaviour of secondary fractures in crystalline rocks at Forsmark during potential large earthquake events. The mechanisms of coseismic responses of secondary fractures\/faults have been the focus of many previous theoretical, observational, experimental and numerical studies,\n8\u201313\n which indicates that static and dynamic stress changes following the causative fault rupture may both play roles in triggering coseismic activities. The static effect permanently adjusts the state of stress in crustal rocks,\n8\n while the dynamic disturbance may alter fracture properties\n11\n or generate instantaneous failure.\n10\n In order to predict the coseismic behaviour of fractures at Forsmark, F\u00e4lth et al. (2015)\n14\n used a distinct element code 3DEC to model the rupture of a primary fault and analyse the coseismic responses of an array of isolated secondary fractures at the repository depth. This model has been further applied to conduct sensitivity analysis and estimate slip magnitude of individual fractures under different earthquake rupture scenarios.\n15\n Their simulation results suggest that most of the secondary fractures (assumed isolated) at the Forsmark repository site would not exceed the safety threshold, i.e. 5\u00a0cm, except for those located very close to the primary fault (e.g. the fracture-to-fault distance is less than 200\u00a0m). However, whether this conclusion still holds for the actual ground condition at Forsmark involving non-isolated, highly-intersected fracture networks\n16\n\n,\n\n17\n needs to be examined.\nIn this paper, we develop and apply a seismo-mechanical model to study the displacements of secondary fractures and fracture networks in crystalline rock during large earthquakes and provide implications for the safety of the nuclear waste repository at Forsmark as well as other repository sites worldwide. We limit our scope to the dynamic triggering effect in the current research. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the numerical approaches for geomechanical and seismological modelling. Section 3 shows the model setup and boundary conditions for numerical simulations, with the results further elucidated in Section 4. Finally, a discussion is given and conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\n\n2.1\nGeomechanics model\nWe develop a finite element method-based geomechanics model to simulate the deformation of intact rocks and displacement of natural fractures under combined static and dynamic loadings. The governing equations and constitutive relationships included in the geomechanics model are summarised in this subsection. Note that we use the rock mechanics sign convention, such that compressive stress and strain are positive, while tensile stress and strain are negative.\nThe equation of motion of the fractured rock is governed by Newton's second law\n18\n as:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\nu\n\n\n\u2202\n\nt\n2\n\n\n\n=\n\u2207\n\u22c5\n\u03c3\n+\n\nF\nv\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density, u is the velocity vector, t is the time, \u03c3 is the stress tensor and F\nv is the body force. The stress-strain relationship of rock materials follows Hooke's law as \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a0C:\u03b5, where C is the compliance tensor and \u03b5 is the strain tensor given as \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a0[\u2207u+(\u2207u)T]\/2.\nWe categorise the displacement behaviour of natural fractures into three different regimes: contact loss, partial slip and total sliding.\n19\n In the contact loss regime, the opposing walls of a fracture are physically separated (or open) so that no normal or shear stress is transferred across the fracture. In the partial slip regime, the fracture walls are in contact and under static friction. In the total sliding regime, the fracture walls are in contact and under kinetic friction. The normal stress-normal displacement relationship of a natural fracture is given by:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n=\n\n{\n\n\n\n\n0\n,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nu\nn\n\n<\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\nn\n\n\nu\nn\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nu\nn\n\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c3\nn is the normal stress imposed perpendicularly to the fracture, k\nn is the fracture normal stiffness and u\nn is the normal displacement (positive value indicates fracture closure). The shear stress-shear displacement relationship of a natural fracture is governed by Coulomb's law of friction as:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n=\n\n{\n\n\n\n\n0\n,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nu\nn\n\n<\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin\n\n[\n\n\nk\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nu\ns\n\n\u2212\n\nu\n0\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n]\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nu\nn\n\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c4\ns is the shear stress along the tangential direction of the fracture, k\ns is the fracture shear stiffness, u\ns is the fracture shear displacement, u\n0 is the origin displacement at which the partial slip starts or restarts (more explanations of u\n0 can be found in Appendix A), and \u03bc is the friction coefficient. It can be seen that, the contact loss regime corresponds to the condition of u\nn\u00a0<\u00a00, the partial slip regime corresponds to the scenario of u\nn\u00a0\u2265\u00a00 and \u03c4\ns < \u03bc\u03c3\nn, and the total sliding regime corresponds to the state of u\nn\u00a0\u2265\u00a00 and \u03c4\ns\u00a0=\u00a0\u03bc\u03c3\nn. In Appendix A, we verify the implementation of this fracture constitutive model for simulating the stress and displacement evolution of a single fracture subject to constant\/cyclic normal and shear loadings, demonstrating that this model can well capture the switch of fracture displacement manner between different regimes as well as the irreversible sliding behaviour (manifested by the hysteresis loop). Under earthquake-induced ground vibrations and dynamic loadings, a natural fracture may experience an arbitrary combination of the three displacement regimes.\nThe coupled system of governing equations and constitutive formulations is solved using an implicit time-dependent solution scheme based on the generalised-alpha method.\n20\n We discretise the problem domain of a two-dimensional fractured rock using an unstructured grid of quadratic, triangular finite elements, in which natural fractures are represented by joint elements embedded in between the opposing triangular elements (Fig. 1\n). The properties and behaviour of individual fractures (e.g. stress, displacement and stiffness) are thus explicitly represented in our model.\n\n\n2.2\nEarthquake model\nWe derive the earthquake-induced displacement field based on the seismic source theory.\n21\n The radial displacement component induced by the P-wave propagation is given as:\n\n(4a)\n\n\n\nu\nr\n\n=\n\n1\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\u03c1\n\nV\nP\n3\n\nr\n\n\n\nM\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\n\nt\n\u2212\nr\n\/\n\nV\nP\n\n\n)\n\nsin\n\n2\n\n\u03b8\n\ncos\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\nand the two shear displacement components caused by the S-wave propagation is described by:\n\n(4b)\n\n\n\nu\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\n1\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\u03c1\n\nV\nS\n3\n\nr\n\n\n\nM\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\n\nt\n\u2212\nr\n\/\n\nV\nS\n\n\n)\n\ncos\n\n2\n\n\u03b8\n\ncos\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4c)\n\n\n\nu\n\u03c6\n\n=\n\n1\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\u03c1\n\nV\nS\n3\n\nr\n\n\n\nM\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\n\nt\n\u2212\nr\n\/\n\nV\nS\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\u2212\ncos\n\n2\n\n\u03b8\n\n)\n\nsin\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density, r is the epicentral distance, \n\n\nM\n\u02d9\n\n\n is the seismic moment rate or source time function (i.e. time derivative of the seismic moment function M), t is the time, \u03b8 is the polar angle, \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle, and V\nP and V\nS are the P- and S-wave speeds given, respectively, as:\n\n(5a)\n\n\n\nV\nP\n\n=\n\n\n\nE\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03c5\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n(\n\n1\n+\n\u03c5\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03c5\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5b)\n\n\n\nV\nS\n\n=\n\n\nE\n\n2\n\u03c1\n\n(\n\n1\n+\n\u03c5\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere E is the Young's modulus, \u03c1 is the density and \u03bd is the Poisson's ratio.

Thus, based on Eqs. 6\u201310, we can derive the seismic moment rate for earthquakes of different moment magnitudes (Fig. 3\n shows an example for M\nw\u00a0=\u00a05.6), which can be further substituted into Eq. (4) to calculate the temporal and spatial evolution of the earthquake-induced displacement field. In this paper, the use of the seismic source theory in combination with a generic source time function aims to provide a first-order estimation of earthquake-induced off-fault displacement field, whereas more accurate calculations may be possibly achieved by incorporating more realistic (or even site-specific) source time functions into the general modelling framework developed here. It is worth pointing out that previous studies suggest that the ground motion seems to only moderately depend on the source time functional form, but more controlled by the seismic duration and maximum moment rate.\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nModel description\nIn this section, we apply the methods as described in section 2 to study the coseismic displacement behaviour of secondary fracture systems at Forsmark site, Sweden during a potential post-glacial large earthquake. Below, we first compile the site characterisation data important for our analysis, and then describe the model setup and calculation procedure.\n\n3.1\nModel parameters\nExtensive site investigations have been conducted at the Forsmark area regarding its geological, geomechanical, hydrological and seismological conditions\/properties,\n2\n\n,\n\n24\u201327\n based on which a detailed site descriptive model has been developed by SKB (Fig. 4\n).\n28\n The key parameters that are relevant to the current modelling study are summarised as follows.\n\n3.1.1\nRock and fracture properties\nThe bedrock at Forsmark mainly formed between 1.9 and 1.85 billion years ago, during the Paleoproterozoic Era.\n28\n The planned repository is located inside a relatively homogeneous rock volume consisting of medium-grained metamorphic granite. The entire rock volume can be divided into several fracture domains named as FFM01-06 and the repository is within the fracture domains of FFM01 and FFM06\n23\n (Fig. 4). In this study, we focus on the fracture domain of FFM01, which is close to the potential seismogenic fault ZFMA2 (more description about this fault can be found in section 3.1.3). The material properties of intact rocks and natural fractures in FFM01 are as given in Table 1\n.\n23\n\n,\n\n25\n The P- and S-wave speeds in intact rocks are then derived using equations (5a) and (5b) as 5580\u00a0m\/s and 3264\u00a0m\/s, respectively, which are similar to those adopted in previous studies of the Forsmark site.\n14\n\n,\n\n15\n Four sets of fractures, i.e. NE, NS, NW, SH, are globally distributed in FFM01 and their orientation statistics may fit to the Fisher's distribution with the scattering defined by a dispersion factor. Table 2\n gives the mean pole trend, mean pole plunge and the dispersion factor of all these global fracture sets. Here, we do not include the so-called local fracture sets that only occasionally appear in some local regions and tend to play a minor role.\n23\n The lengths of fractures in FFM01 may follow a power-law distribution with the probability density function defined as\n29\n:\n\n(11)\n\n\nn\n\n(\nl\n,\nL\n)\n\n=\n\u03b3\n\nL\nD\n\n\nl\n\n\u2212\na\n\n\n,\u00a0for\u00a0\nl\n\u2208\n\n[\n\nl\nmin\n\n,\n\nl\nmax\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nwhere l is the fracture length, L is the domain size, a is the power-law length exponent, D is the fractal dimension, and \u03b3 is the density term. The only intrinsic characteristic length scales are the smallest and largest fracture lengths, i.e. l\nmin and l\nmax, respectively. In numerical simulations, L is the scale of the modelling domain, which usually meets l\nmin\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0L\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0l\nmax.\n30\n Outcrop data mapped at the Forsmark site suggest that D\u00a0=\u00a02, a\u00a0=\u00a03.0 and \u03b3\u00a0\u2248\u00a04.0.\n29\n\n,\n\n31\n The relative density of each fracture set is also indicated in Table 2, according to which the length data can be proportionally assigned to the different sets when constructing discrete fracture networks (see section 3.2).\n\n\n3.1.2\nPresent-day and end-glacial stress fields\nThe present-day in-situ stress state at the Forsmark site has been characterised through comprehensive stress measurement campaigns,\n1\n which indicate that the magnitude of principal stress components at the depth between 400 and 600\u00a0m tend to follow\n32\n:\n\n(12a)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nH\n\n=\n29.5\n+\n0.023\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(12b)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nh\n\n=\n9.2\n+\n0.028\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(12c)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n=\n0.0265\nz\n\n\n\nwhere z is the depth (unit: m), \u03c3\nH and \u03c3\nh are the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses (unit: MPa), respectively, and \u03c3\nv is the vertical stress (unit: MPa). The mean orientation of \u03c3\nH is 145\u00b0 clockwise with respect to North. We assume the pore pressure is hydrostatically distributed in the granitic unit with the water table located at the ground surface. Then, the pore pressure is calculated as p\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c1\nw\ngz, where \u03c1\nw\u00a0=\u00a01000\u00a0kg\/m3 is the water density and g\u00a0=\u00a09.8\u00a0m\/s2 is the gravitational acceleration. We define a Biot coefficient of 1.0 so that the effective principal stress components, i.e. \u03c3\u2032\nH, \u03c3\u2032\nh and \u03c3\u2032\nv, can be further derived by subtracting the pore pressure value from the total stress components (Fig. 5\na).\nDuring the repository assessment period, multiple glacial cycles involving ice sheet advance and retreat may happen.\n1\n The growth of the continental ice sheet will increase the mechanical load on crustal rocks, leading to elevated vertical and horizontal stresses. During the deglaciation, the ice sheet retreats much faster than the isostatic rebound of the lithosphere, such that the glacially-induced vertical stress diminishes rapidly while the horizontal stress remains for a long period of time. The resulting high stress anisotropy, together with potential pore fluid overpressure, may cause fault destabilisation and trigger earthquakes.\n6\n Using the reconstructed Weichselian glacial cycle as a reference condition,\n33\n the magnitudes of excess maximum and minimum horizontal stresses that remain after the ice retreat have been estimated as \u0394\u03c3\nH\u00a0=\u00a011.0\u00a0MPa and \u0394\u03c3\nh\u00a0=\u00a07.6\u00a0MPa, respectively, within the upper 1\u00a0km depth.\n23\n We assume the glacial processes do not significantly alter the stress orientation, i.e. \u03c3\nH still trends 145\u00b0 with respect to North. Furthermore, the glacially-induced residual overpressure (unit: MPa) may follow \u0394p\u00a0=\u00a00.0022z for the depth z\u00a0\u2264\u00a0450\u00a0m and \u0394p\u00a0=\u00a00.0109z-3.91 for the depth z\u00a0>\u00a0450\u00a0m.\n34\n Thus, the end-glacial effective principal stress components can be further estimated based on the present-day stress state and the excess stress or pore pressure values, as shown in Fig. 5b.\n\n\n3.1.3\nEarthquake scenarios\nDuring the assessment period of up to one million years for the KBS-3 repository, one large earthquake (at most two) having a moment magnitude \u22655 within a 5\u00a0km radius around the repository may be expected.\n1\n Such an earthquake is considered to be probably triggered by post-glacial processes that destabilise some of the fault zones around the repository.\n33\n Based on the established site descriptive model of SKB (Fig. 4),\n28\n most fault zones at Forsmark are steeply dipping (80\u00b0-90\u00b0) and are therefore anticipated to be stable under the present-day\/post-glacial reverse faulting stress regimes.\n15\n However, a few gently dipping (20\u00b0-30\u00b0) reverse fault zones, e.g. a shallow fault zone called ZFMA2 (Fig. 4), may potentially be reactivated by post-glacial activities,\n14\n\n,\n\n15\n producing large earthquakes threatening the integrity of deposition holes and waste canisters. Thus, in this study, we assume ZFMA2 as the primary fault that accommodates a post-glacial earthquake rupture, whilst all other major fault zones are stable. The ZFMA2 fault zone\n1\n\n,\n\n14\n\n,\n\n15\n\n,\n\n28\n has a strike of N80\u00b0E, a dip angle of \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a024\u00b0, a maximum depth of 1.1\u00a0km, a surface trace length of 4.2\u00a0km, and a maximum rupture area of 12\u00a0km2. According to the previous rupture modelling results in the literature, the ZFMA2 fault tends to accommodate a maximum earthquake moment magnitude of M\nw\u00a0\u2248\u00a05.614,15 with the corresponding seismic moment M\n0 calculated as 3.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01017\u00a0N\u00a0m according to equation (10). Thus, we may estimate the average shear displacement \u0394U on this seismogenic fault to be ~0.92\u00a0m (similar to the values calculated in previous studies\n14\n\n,\n\n15\n), according to the definition of seismic moment M\n0\u00a0=\u00a0GA\u0394U,\n35\n where G\u00a0=\u00a0E\/[2(1+\u03bd)] is the shear modulus and A is the rupture area. Hereafter, we assume M\nw\u00a0=\u00a05.6 in our study for the potential earthquake at the ZFMA2 fault. We acknowledge that this value might be slightly larger than that predicted from the empirical relationship between moment magnitude and rupture area, which gives M\nw\u00a0=\u00a05.1\u20135.5 for reverse faulting.\n36\n However, it is reasonable to assume a larger M\nw as a limiting case\n14\n to account for large uncertainties and potential extremes involved in the long-term safety assessment of nuclear waste repository. The hypocentre is assumed at the centre of the fault, i.e. 550 m depth. The planned repository (at the 500\u00a0m depth) is in the footwall of ZFMA2 and northwest to the hypocentre (Fig. 4). Note that the considered post-glacial earthquake has a much shallower hypocentre than most earthquakes of tectonic origin; however, shallow earthquakes with hypocentral depth <1\u00a0km may still occur, even in the current day.\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nModel setup and calculation procedure\nWe model a two-dimensional (2D) square domain of fractured rock (i.e. named as problem domain) with the domain size L\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0m and the domain centre situated at the 500\u00a0m depth (Fig. 5a). We choose the 2D cross-section in the plane of the maximum horizontal stress \u03c3\nH and the vertical stress \u03c3\nv, where the highest in-plane stress anisotropy is expected given the reverse faulting stress regime (\u03c3\nH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c3\nh\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c3\nv) at the Forsmark site, favouring the shear reactivation of secondary fractures. We define a polar coordinate system oriented along the intersection between the primary fault ZFMA2 and the \u03c3\nH-\u03c3\nv plane (Fig. 6\na). In the context of such a coordinate system, the problem domain is embedded within a larger auxiliary cell (Fig. 6a) of the same material (for the ease of imposing seismic loads) having a radial size of 2L and an angular size of 2L\/r\n0, where r\n0 is the distance between the centre of the problem domain (O\u2032 in Fig. 6a) and the hypocentre (O in Fig. 6a). We run the 2D plane-strain simulation in three stages: (i) the present-day stage, (ii) the end-glacial stage and (iii) the earthquake stage. During the loading stage (i), the present-day effective stress components, i.e. \u03c3\u2032\nV and \u03c3\u2032\nH (Fig. 5a), are orthogonally imposed to the problem domain (via a ramp to avoid spurious oscillations) with the gravity-induced body forces applied as well, such that the fractured rock reaches an equilibrium under the contemporary static loading. During the loading stage (ii), the end-glacial effective stress components (Fig. 5b) incorporating the excess horizontal stress and residual overpressure are applied to the fractured rock (also via a ramp). Here, we omit the effect of stress history during glacial advance and retreat, considering that fractures tend to be more stabilised when ice sheet grows\n33\n and negligible displacements are expected (this is confirmed by our results of very small pre-earthquake slip in section 4). During the loading stage (iii), an earthquake of M\nw\u00a0=\u00a05.6 is assumed to be generated by the reverse faulting of the primary fault ZFMA2 and the resulting displacement field is imposed to the boundaries of the auxiliary cell that encloses the problem domain (Fig. 6a). The auxiliary cell boundaries are also conditioned with a low-reflecting treatment\n20\n to suppress unexpected spurious reflection waves. This low-reflecting approach absorbs outgoing waves by imposing a viscous damping force at the model boundary aiming to achieve a perfect impedance match for both P and S waves.\n20\n Since \u03c3\nH trends 145\u00b0 with respect to North while the primary fault ZFMA2 has a strike of N80\u00b0E, the azimuth angle \u03c6 of the \u03c3\nH-\u03c3\nv plane is thus calculated as 25\u00b0. According to the SKB's plan, KBS-3 repository will be built in the footwall of ZFMA227 and northwest to the assumed hypocentre of ZFMA2 (Fig. 4). We explore a number of distance scenarios where the centre of the problem domain is away from the hypocentre (towards North) by r\n0\u00a0=\u00a0400, 500 \u2026, 1600\u00a0m (Fig. 6b). We model the crystalline rock embedded with either a single fracture or fracture network. For the single fracture scenario, the fracture centre coincides with the centre of the problem domain and we consider four fracture length values of l\u00a0=\u00a025, 50, 75 and 100\u00a0m, and a range of apparent dip angles (i.e. in-plane dip angles) of \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0, 20\u00b0, \u2026, 180\u00b0. For the fracture network scenario, we generate discrete fracture network realisations (Fig. 7\n) obeying the power-law length scaling and orientation\/density statistics as described in section 3.1.1. We define the maximum fracture length l\nmax\u00a0=\u00a020L\u00a0=\u00a02000 m; however, it is worth pointing out that the actual maximum length in the problem domain is controlled by the domain size L and thus the selection of l\nmax is not essential as long as it is much larger than L. We explore two minimum fracture length values of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a0L\/10\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0m or L\/20\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0m with the two cases sharing exactly the same large fractures of l\u00a0\u2265\u00a010\u00a0m (same locations, orientations and lengths) (Fig. 7). It may be expected that the small fractures of l\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0m tend to accommodate less shear displacements compared to large fractures, but they may still affect the bulk connectivity\n37\n and therefore the deformability of the fracture network,\n29\n which may need to be examined. We stochastically generate ten sets of fracture network realisations (i.e. ten realisations for each l\nmin setting) to minimise the potential random effect via configurational averaging. We run numerical simulations using the finite element method-based solver COMSOL Multiphysics,\n20\n and the simulation results are reported and analysed in the next section.\n\n\n\n4\nSimulation results\n\n4.1\nSingle fracture\n\nFig. 8\n shows the simulation results of a single secondary fracture with a length of l\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0m and an apparent dip angle of \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00b0 at a distance of r\n0\u00a0=\u00a0400\u00a0m to the hypocentre of an earthquake with a moment magnitude of M\nw\u00a0=\u00a05.6. We set a monitoring probe at the fracture centre (where the maximum shear displacement is expected) to record the temporal variation of fracture normal stress, shear stress and shear displacement. The rupture of the primary fault starts at t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0s, and the radiated P- and S-waves successively arrive at the fracture, resulting in strong fluctuations of normal and shear stresses. The normal stress in general decreases because the fracture is located in the dilational quadrant during the reverse faulting of the primary fault. The reduced normal stress tends to weaken the shear resistance of the fracture, while the earthquake-induced differential stress attempts to reactive the fracture for shearing. The shear stress exhibits temporary fluctuations during t\u00a0=\u00a00.12\u20130.25\u00a0s due to the alternating phases of partial slip and total sliding. Then, both the normal and shear stresses stay at zero (i.e. fracture walls are not in contact) during t\u00a0=\u00a00.25\u20131.95\u00a0s, after which they gradually recover after the passage of earthquake waves. The earthquake-induced shear displacement does not occur instantaneously when the P- or S-wave arrives, but starts to significantly increase when the fracture is reactivated for total sliding (after t\u00a0=\u00a00.12\u00a0s). The shear displacement reaches its maximum value (~11.3\u00a0cm) at the earthquake peak time (at t\u00a0=\u00a01.1\u00a0s) and then gradually decreases to an irreversible value after the earthquake (after t\u00a0=\u00a02.1\u00a0s). It can be seen that the shear displacement-time curve exhibits small local fluctuations, which are related to ground vibrations during the earthquake. Furthermore, in Fig. 9\n, we show the spatial distribution of shear displacement along this single fracture both at the earthquake peak time and after the earthquake rupture, where a symmetrical displacement profile is observed with the maximum shear displacement in the vicinity of the fracture centre (slight asymmetry is also noticed). We use the maximum value of shear displacement along the entire fracture in the following sensitivity analysis.\nWe compare the maximum shear displacement of the single fracture (denoted u\ns,peak for the peak value at the earthquake peak time and u\ns,resid for the residual value after the earthquake rupture) for different values of fracture length l, apparent dip angle \u03b2, and fracture-to-hypocentre distance r\n0 (Fig. 10\n). When r\n0\u00a0=\u00a0400\u00a0m (Fig. 10a), the fracture shows very large displacements u\ns,peak in many dip angle scenarios, well beyond the safety threshold of u\nsc\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0cm, especially if the fracture length l\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0m. The displacement also shows a strong dip angle-dependent behaviour with the largest values occur if \u03b2\u00a0\u2248\u00a0100\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. Most of the coseismic displacement is reversible and the irreversible component u\ns,resid is much smaller than u\ns,peak in most dip angle cases. It can be seen that high residual displacement occurs in the case of 60\u00b0 for which the peak displacement is low; this is because the fracture in this case is less open (i.e. stays in contact) such that frictional resistance significantly restricts the recoverability of shear dislocation. When r\n0 increases to 700\u00a0m (Fig. 10b), the maximum peak shear displacement u\ns,peak reduces significantly. However, the large fracture with l\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0m may still marginally exceed the safety threshold for certain dip angles, e.g. \u03b2\u00a0\u2248\u00a0120\u00b0. When r\n0\u00a0=\u00a01000 or 1300\u00a0m, the shear displacement stays below the safety threshold irrespective of the dip angle (Fig. 10c and d). On the other hand, the residual displacement u\ns,resid shows a much less sensitivity to the fracture-to-hypocentre distance. We further extract the maximum peak and residual shear displacement among all dip angle scenarios, and examine its variation as a function of the fracture-to-hypocentre distance (Fig. 11\n). Clearly, a longer fracture tends to accommodate larger maximum peak shear displacement. Very large shear displacements occur in fractures of l\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0m located close to the hypocentre, e.g. r\n0\u00a0=\u00a0400\u00a0m. The shear displacement drops significantly with the increase of r\n0 and becomes below the safety threshold when r\n0\u00a0>\u00a0700\u00a0m. The residual displacement seems to be invariant in the distance range of r\n0\u00a0\u2264\u00a01100\u00a0m, and then gradually decreases as the distance exceeds this range.\n\n\n4.2\nFracture network\nWe then study the coseismic shear displacements in the realistic fracture networks generated based on the site investigation data of Forsmark (as described in section 3.2). Fig. 12\n illustrates the temporal and spatial variations of the shear displacement distribution in the two fracture networks associated with different minimum fracture lengths of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0m and l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0m and located at a distance of r\n0\u00a0=\u00a0400\u00a0m to the hypocentre. Prior to the earthquake rupture (i.e. t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0s), the fracture network accommodates almost negligible shearing in the system. Significant shear displacements start to emerge during the earthquake and reaches the maximum values at the earthquake peak time (i.e. t\u00a0=\u00a01.1\u00a0s). It can be seen that only a small proportion of the fracture network is reactivated for sliding and the most sheared segments seem to belong to the interconnected \u201cbackbone\u201d of the fracture system. Here, the backbone is a subnetwork of fractures that form connected structures spanning the domain and often dominate the bulk behaviour of the system.\n38\n Interestingly, unlike in the single fracture scenario, the dip angle seems to play a less important role and the most reactivated fractures may dip at a wide range of angles. Certain difference is observed regarding the reactivated multi-segment cluster pattern in the two fracture networks with different l\nmin values. This is because the inclusion of small fractures (5\u00a0m\u00a0\u2264\u00a0l\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0m) slightly alters the connectivity structure of the system such that a fracture \u226510\u00a0m may be suppressed for shearing in the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0m (because it is not connected to the backbone) but then become connected to the backbone in the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0m allowing large displacements. Thus, the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0m seems to have more reactivated fractures than the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0m. After the earthquake (t\u00a0=\u00a02.1\u00a0s), some irreversible displacements remain in the system and the two networks show similar patterns. Note that the location of high residual shear displacement does not necessarily corresponds to that of high peak shear displacement. During the passage of seismic waves, some fractures may experience reduced normal stress or even lose the contact between opposing walls (like the single fracture in Fig. 8) such that high peak shear displacement is produced but this displacement can be mostly recovered. On the other hand, the shear of some other fractures may be mainly driven by differential stresses while the fracture walls remain clamped, so that more irreversible component develops. Furthermore, the stress and strain redistribution after the earthquake rupture may also cause some fractures to have the residual displacement larger than the peak displacement (Fig. 12). In Fig. 13\n, we further show the spatial distribution of peak and residual shear displacement along a fracture (~66\u00a0m long) that exists in both fracture networks. Due to the interconnection with other fractures, the displacement profile of this fracture exhibits a strong discontinuity characteristic that is very different from the elliptical-shaped displacement profile of an isolated fracture (Fig. 9). It can also be seen that the fracture in the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0m accommodates more shear displacements compared to that in the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0m, suggesting that the inclusion of small fractures (5\u00a0m\u00a0\u2264\u00a0l\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0m) tends to enhance the shear reactivation of large fractures.\nWe compare the shear displacement field at the earthquake peak time in the fracture networks located at different distances to the hypocentre (Fig. 14\n). When r\n0\u00a0=\u00a0400\u00a0m, considerable shear displacements beyond the safety threshold of 5\u00a0cm are accommodated in the system. With the increase of r\n0, the shear displacements become gradually suppressed, especially when r\n0\u00a0\u2265\u00a0700\u00a0m. Note that some fractures at a larger distance may become slightly more reactivated for shearing, which is caused by the change of relative orientation between fractures and the earthquake rupture plane with the distance. However, the trend of reduced shear displacement with increased distance in general holds. In Fig. 14, it can also be seen that large shear displacements are mainly accommodated by fractures belonging to the backbone. Some fractures of similar sizes and orientations but not belonging to the backbone show much smaller shear displacements compared to their counterparts inside the backbone. More fractures are reactivated in the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0m compared to those in the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0m. In Fig. 15\n, we analyse how the maximum peak and residual shear displacement (among all fractures in the network) varies as a function of the distance to the hypocentre. In general, the maximum shear displacement declines with the increase of r\n0, and drops below the safety threshold when r\n0\u00a0\u2265\u00a0700\u00a0m. The selection of l\nmin, however, has a minor impact on the maximum shear displacement. This is possibly because the maximum shear displacement is controlled by the large fractures that constitute the core part of the backbone, such that the inclusion of small fractures (e.g. l\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0m) may introduce more fractures into the backbone (resulting in more reactivated segments) but does not fundamentally change the connectivity architecture. In other words, the inclusion of small fractures may locally change the shear behaviour of some large fractures (as shown in Fig. 13), but the maximum shear displacement is still ruled by the preferentially-oriented, dominant large fractures. It has to be clarified that these small fractures still play an important role in the deformational behaviour of the system as demonstrated by the fact that more shear displacements are accommodated in the network of l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0m compared to l\nmin\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0m. It is just the inclusion of these small fractures tend to have little impact on the maximum value of shear displacement. By comparing Fig. 15 against Fig. 11, it can be seen that the fracture network accommodates larger maximum shear displacements (both peak and residual displacements) than an isolated single fracture, which is because the interconnected fracture network tends to significantly reduce the bulk modulus and enhance the deformability of the rock mass. For the fracture network, the fracture-to-hypocentre safety distance with the maximum shear displacement starts to drop below 5\u00a0cm is about 700\u00a0m (Fig. 15), which is similar to that for 100\u00a0m-long single fractures (Fig. 11). It is noted that the maximum residual displacement of the fracture network exhibits a much stronger sensitivity to the fracture-to-hypocentre distance compared to that of a single fracture, which may be attributed to the interlocking effect in the fracture network making coseismic displacements more difficult to recover.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion and conclusions\nIn this paper, we conducted 2D numerical modelling of the coseismic response of secondary fractures in crystalline rock during large earthquake events. We investigated the scenario of isolated single fractures with various lengths and dip angles located at a range of distances to the hypocentre of an earthquake with a moment magnitude of M\nw\u00a0=\u00a05.6, and observed significant earthquake-induced shear displacement when the fracture is close to the hypocentre. For example, if the fracture-to-hypocentre distance is 400\u00a0m, the maximum peak shear displacement of a 100\u00a0m-long fracture may exceed 11\u00a0cm; however, if the distance is 700\u00a0m, the peak displacement is only marginally beyond the safety threshold of 5\u00a0cm (Fig. 11). It seems that the maximum peak shear displacement derived in our study is higher than the maximum values reported by F\u00e4lth et al. based on their numerical simulations of the Forsmark site (i.e. only ~7\u00a0cm for a 150\u00a0m-long fracture 200\u00a0m away from the primary fault).\n14\n\n,\n\n15\n One reason is that different distance metrics were used: in our paper, we measure the distance between the fracture centre and the hypocentre (for the convenience of using the seismic source model), whilst F\u00e4lth et al. presented their results based on the distance of the fracture centre to the fault plane. In their model, a fracture 200\u00a0m away from the fault plane has a nearest distance of \u2265500\u00a0m to the hypocentre.\n15\n In our simulation, the maximum peak shear displacement at the fracture-to-hypocentre distance of 500\u00a0m is ~8\u00a0cm, which is in fact very close to that derived by F\u00e4lth et al.\u2018s model. Although our 2D model tends to underestimate the connectivity of 3D systems,\n39\n this dimensional effect may be somewhat compromised by the assumption of an in-plane hypocentre in the 2D model (i.e. the normal vectors of 2D fractures are all in the same plane with the hypocentre), which may overestimate the seismic response of the fracture system. This possibly leads to the similar estimates of fracture shear displacement in our 2D model and in F\u00e4lth et al.\u2018s 3D model. In addition to the peak shear displacement, we also emphasise that it is important to characterise the residual component, which can be a critically important parameter for repeated earthquake scenarios. Our results indicate that, if two earthquakes are expected, a fracture-to-hypocentre distance of \u22651200\u00a0m may be needed.\nIt should be admitted that the 2D seismo-mechanical model developed in this paper has some limitations, such as the assumption of an in-plane hypocentre and the simplification of fracture geometries omitting their 3D nature. However, this 2D model is computationally much more efficient than 3D simulation, so that we could further explore the coseismic responses of realistic fracture networks involving highly-intersected fracture sets and fracture length\/orientation variations. We found that the earthquake-induced displacement field in a fracture network tends to be dominated by its backbone structure. This phenomenon is consistent with previous studies showing that the shear displacements of a fracture network are often localised into a few dominant fractures or clusters (i.e. interconnected sub-networks) in the system.\n40\u201342\n An interesting finding from our 2D fracture network modelling is that the fracture-to-hypocentre safety distance (beyond which shear displacements stay below 5\u00a0cm) is around the same value for single fracture scenarios. Thus, the respect distance estimated for single fractures in previous SKB investigations\n7\n\n,\n\n43\n may also be applicable for fracture networks, although more research efforts are needed to confirm this. It is worth pointing out a few other aspects that may also need to be addressed in future modelling efforts. First, fractures in rock may not be planar structures and usually show strong irregularities, undulations and heterogeneities,\n44\n which may have important impacts on the shear displacement behaviour.\n45\u201347\n Second, the constitutive behaviour of fractured rocks may also be much more complex in natural systems,\n35\n which may involve brittle failure in intact rocks (rather than obeying linear elasticity) and rate- and state-dependent friction along rough discontinuities (rather than obeying Coulomb's law). Third, realistic (or even site-specific) source time functions may be used to achieve more accurate prediction of the coseismic displacement field; however, high-resolution characterisation of detailed source time functions of natural earthquakes may not be a trivial task, which may reply on comprehensive recordings of strong ground motion near the causative fault with broadband seismometers.\n21\n Furthermore, static stress change may occur following the mainshock and play a role in coseismic triggering of nearby fractures,\n9\n the analysis of which may require a direct modelling of the rupture process along the seismogenic fault.\nTo conclude, we observed that the coseismic shear displacement of an isolated secondary fracture tends to be strongly dependent on the fracture length and dip angle, while the coseismic displacement of a highly-intersected fracture system is more governed by the connectivity structure of the network. Profound coseismic shear displacement occurs when the secondary fracture or fracture network is close to the hypocentre and located in the dilational quadrant of the primary seismogenic fault, where significantly reduced normal stress and shear resistance may occur along the fracture. However, the earthquake-induced shear displacement decreases drastically with the increased distance to the hypocentre and if the distance is more than 700\u00a0m, the coseismic shear displacement of fractures with lengths \u2264100\u00a0m tends to stay below the safety threshold of 5\u00a0cm, above which the shear failure of waste canisters may occur. If two repeated earthquakes would occur, a distance of no less than 1200\u00a0m may be needed to avoid the accumulated displacement exceeding the safety threshold. The observation and analysis of coseismic responses of secondary fracture systems as presented in this paper have important implications for the long-term safety assessment of planned nuclear waste repositories in crystalline rocks in many countries worldwide.\n\n","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFault reactivation is associated with (incremental) slip displacement along existing natural faults after a long period of inactivity (e.g\n1\n), and is evaluated because slip displacement may cause an increase of fault permeability, earthquakes and damage to wells. An increase of permeability along fault planes may cause leakage of potentially contaminated or economically valuable fluids and gases out of a subsurface reservoir. This is a concern during production from oil and gas reservoirs, in particular in case of Enhance Oil Recovery (EOR) operations when injecting water, gas or steam. The same concerns are present when disposing water or CO2 in (depleted) subsurface reservoirs. Recorded earthquakes in areas with such activities may be induced or triggered.\n2\n\n,\n\n3\n Earthquakes generate ground velocity and ground acceleration that could damage houses and other infrastructure (e.g.\n4\u20136\n). Finally, slip displacement caused by fault reactivation may deform injection or production wells to such an extent that they become inoperable. This may again result in leakage of tubulars (loss of containments), inability to re-enter the well for maintenance operations, or complete failure.\n7\n\n,\n\n8\n\n\nFault reactivation is caused by shear failure and is described by a stress-based failure criterion.\n1\n\n,\n\n9\n\n,\n\n10\n Slip displacement along a plane in the subsurface occurs if the resultant shear stress \u03c4 exceeds the shear strength \u03c4max in the point of evaluation. The shear strength is most often assumed to adhere to the Mohr-Coulomb friction law\n9\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\nmax\n\n=\nC\n+\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, C is the cohesion stress, \n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\nS\nn\n\n\u2212\n\nP\np\n\n\n)\n\n\n is the normal effective stress on the fault plane, with S\n\nn\n the normal total stress and P\n\np\n the pore pressure, and \n\n\u03bc\n=\ntan\n\n\u03d5\n\n is the friction coefficient with \n\u03d5\n the angle of internal friction. Faults are generally assumed to be planes of weakness relative to the surrounding rock formations (e.g.\n10\n). This implies that the shear strength \u03c4max of a fault is assumed to be smaller than adjacent rock. Based on the work by Byerlee,\n11\n the cohesion C of geological faults is often considered to be negligible, while the fault friction coefficient \u03bc is assumed between 0.6 and 1.0, where a value of 0.6 is used as a default in many studies.\nThe slip tendency\n12\n is a convenient metric to assess the criticality of faults and is defined as the ratio of the resultant shear stress to the normal effective stress on a pre-defined surface:\n\n(2)\n\n\nT\ns\n\n=\n\u03c4\n\/\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn the absence of a cohesion strength, the slip tendency T\n\ns\n can be compared with the (often unknown) fault friction coefficient to identify the most critically stressed faults. The slip tendency T\n\ns\n depends entirely on the orientation of the considered surface and the magnitude and orientation of the assumed stress field and does not include any assumption on the shear failure criterion nor its constants.\nIn the 1990's, the slip tendency was used to explain the episodic migration of fluids in the Earth's crest by an increase of fault permeability due to reactivation of faults (earthquakes) on a geological time scale.\n13\n The implied fault-valve mechanism assumes a homogenous, slow but pervasive increase of pore pressure P\n\np\n or reduction of total normal stress S\n\nn\n due to geological processes that brings faults to a critical state of stress (slip tendency). The slip tendency proved to be a useful parameter to assess the risk of seismicity in the Yucca Mountains (Nevada, USA\n12\n), and to infer the paleo stress condition from the preferred orientation of natural reactivated faults and slip lineations.\n14\n\n\nSubsequent studies also addressed human induced hazards using the concept of slip tendency. The notion that critically stressed faults could increase fault permeability, provided Wiprut and Zoback\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n the basis to evaluate hydrocarbon leakage (top seal integrity) of the Visund and other fields in the Northern North Sea. In the latter evaluation, leakage was assumed to occur at an incremental reservoir pressure \u0394P, which would satisfy the Mohr-Coulomb failure condition (1). This approach assumed a constant total horizontal and vertical stress condition and is graphically represented by a shift of the Mohr circle (Fig. 1\n).\nWork by Segall et al.\n17\n\n,\n\n18\n and Grasso\n19\n showed however that pressure depletion by oil and gas production causes stress changes in the reservoir as well as in the overburden. Measurements in the Ekofisk field (Norway) and Groningen field (The Netherlands), supported by laboratory measurements and elasticity theory, led to the introduction of so-called stress path coefficients \n\n\n\u03b3\ni\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n,\n\n20\u201322\n:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03b3\ni\n\n=\n\u0394\n\nS\ni\n\n\/\n\u0394\n\nP\np\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u0394\n\nS\ni\n\n\n is the total stress in any of the three principal stress directions and \n\n\u0394\n\nP\np\n\n\n is the change in reservoir pore pressure. The horizontal stress-path coefficient can be directly related to Poisson's ratio \n\u03bd\n and Biot's \n\u03b1\n if uniaxial compaction in an extensive reservoir is assumed\n10\n:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03b3\nh\n\n=\n\u03b1\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe different stress-path coefficients for the vertical and horizontal total stress was incorporated in subsequent assessments of the allowable reservoir pressure for CO2 storage projects,\n23\n\n,\n\n24\n the seismic hazard caused by depleting reservoirs\n25\n and hydraulic fracturing operations.\n26\n This is the approach also suggested by the IEAGHG\n27\n in the assessment of top-seal integrity in CO2 storage projects.\nFacilitated by the increasing computer capacity since the 1990's, two-dimensional finite-element (FE) studies on simplified, but realistic geological structures were conducted to assess fault reactivation as an indicator for potential leakage of CO2 out of geological storage sites,\n28\u201330\n as an indicator for seismicity induced by oil and gas production,\n31\u201334\n or by hydraulic fracturing.\n35\n All these studies show a much more complex distribution of shear stress along the fault plane compared to analyses based on an analytical Mohr circle evaluation. The 2D analyses over the last two decades make it clear that the subsurface structure and, in particular, the reservoir offset have a prominent influence on fault reactivation caused by reservoir depletion or injection.\nIn this study, the results of a conventional Mohr-circle evaluation is compared to the results that are obtained from an equivalent 2D finite-element analyses, and advice is formulated on the appropriate use of both methods. Also, some modelling requirements are formulated when assessing fault reactivation, particularly when a 3D FE model is used. In chapter 2, the Mohr-circle evaluation and the two-dimensional finite-element modelling approach are briefly summarised. In Chapter 3, fault reactivation is evaluated using both methods for reservoirs without offset, considering a depleting gas reservoir as situated in the Northern part of The Netherlands. The influence of the fault dip angle, the horizontal in-situ stress and Poisson's ratio, which influences the stress-path coefficient, are highlighted. The impact of the reservoir offset on the value of the depletion pressure that causes fault reactivation is discussed in Chapter 4 using finite-element techniques only. The minimum element size for meaningful (3D) finite-element analyses on fault reactivation is determined in Chapter 5 by showing the influence of the element size on the computed depletion pressure required for fault reactivation.\n\n\n2\nEvaluation approaches\nThis chapter provides a brief outline of the conventional Mohr-circle evaluation in section 2.1, followed by a description of the two-dimensional finite-element modelling approach and selected constitutive relations and parameters in section 2.2.\n\n2.1\nMohr-circle evaluation\nThe effective stress condition in a single point of the subsurface is evaluated for shear and tensile failure in a so-called Mohr-circle analysis (e.g.\n10,36\n). The total principal stress components \n\n\nS\ni\n\n\n, which can be measured in the subsurface, are related to the principal effective stress components \n\n\n\u03c3\ni\n\n\n, which are used in the failure assessment, according to Terzhagi's law\n9\n:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nS\ni\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\ni\n\n+\n\nP\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \n\n\nP\np\n\n\n is the pore pressure in the point of evaluation, while the subscript \u201ci\u201d denotes any of the principal stress directions (1, 2 or 3). Note that compressive stress is considered positive under compression in equation (5).\nThe stress condition of an arbitrarily oriented fault is located between the three Mohr circles that can be drawn between the three principal effective stresses \n\n\n\u03c3\ni\n\n\n (Figs. 1,\n36\n). In a relaxed structural basin with a normal faulting stress regime, the point \n\n(\n\n\u03c3\n1\n\n,\n\n0\n)\n\n on the Mohr circle represents the effective stress condition on a horizontal plane that is exposed to the vertical effective stress, whereas the point \n\n(\n\n\u03c3\n3\n\n,\n\n0\n)\n\n represents the stress condition on a vertical plane with its normal vector in the direction of the minimum horizontal stress. Shear failure along a fault plane occurs if the shear stress \n\u03c4\n reaches the shear strength (or shear stress capacity) \n\n\n\u03c4\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n. Two different metrics are frequently used to express the tendency of shear failure and fault slip, namely the Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) and the Shear Capacity Utilisation (SCU). The CFS considers the difference between the shear stress and shear strength\n\n(6)\n\n\nC\nF\nS\n=\n\u03c4\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nmax\n\n=\n\u03c4\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nC\n+\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\ntan\n\n\u03d5\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nand has the dimension of stress. Note that the CFS is negative if no shear failure occurs. The SCU considers the dimensionless ratio between the shear stress and the shear stress capacity\n\n(7)\n\n\nS\nC\nU\n=\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\nmax\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\nC\n+\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\ntan\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SCU is defined on the interval [0; 1] and shear failure occurs if SCU\u00a0=\u00a01. The SCU is used for evaluating fault slip along specified fault planes in this study.\nThe total stress in the subsurface changes inside as well as outside the boundaries of the depleting reservoir.\n17\u201319\n\n,\n\n37\n The stress change in the reservoir is assumed linearly proportional to the reservoir depletion as defined by the stress-path coefficients \n\n\n\u03b3\ni\n\n\n in expression (3), where the total vertical stress is assumed to be one of the principal stress directions that does not change with reservoir depletion or injection. Furthermore, it is assumed that the two horizontal principal stress-path coefficients are the same and adhere to expression (4) with Biot's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a01:\n\n(8)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n=\n\u2212\n\u0394\n\nP\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(9)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\nh\n\n=\n\u2212\n\u0394\n\nP\np\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03b3\nh\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to highlight that Biot's \u03b1 may be smaller than 1, thereby influencing the actual stress path.\n38\n Furthermore, it is noted that these expressions are only valid for points within the depleting or injecting reservoir. The change of stress outside the reservoir is dependent on the location of the evaluation point relative to the reservoir, on the geological structure and on the formation properties.\n\n\n2.2\nFinite-element modelling assumptions\nA reservoir-fault configuration representative of the gas fields in the Northern Netherlands is selected for the comparison of a Mohr-circle analysis and a two dimensional finite-element analysis. The Base Case configuration is comprised of a horizontal, 215\u00a0m thick depleting gas reservoir at a depth of 2830\u00a0m, which is intersected by a fault dipping under 65\u00b0 (Fig. 2\na). In the sensitivity analyses of this study, reservoir offset is varied by keeping the top of the foot wall reservoir at the same depth and adjusting the top of the hanging reservoir. The reservoir thickness is varied by adjusting the bottom of the depleting reservoir on both fault blocks by an equal amount.\n\nFig. 2b shows the pore pressure in the fault as a function of depth under initial and depleted reservoir conditions. The dark-blue line indicates the initial pore pressure and shows an over-pressured reservoir and aquifer compared to the pore pressure in the overburden. The green vertical bars on the left-hand side of the graph indicate the depth interval of the depleting reservoir formations. The gas pressure gradient of 0.018\u00a0kPa\/m is based on the gas density in the reservoir formations, with an initial pressure of 35.2\u00a0MPa\u00a0at the gas-water contact at 2995\u00a0m depth. The pore pressure gradient in the aquifer below the reservoir is in pressure communication with the gas reservoir and is 11.66\u00a0kPa\/m. A fresh water gradient of 10.0\u00a0kPa\/m without overpressure is assumed in the overburden. The gas column causes a step-change in pore pressure across the top-seal due to the low density of the gas. The fault follows the equal and uniform pore pressure reduction in the foot wall and hanging wall reservoir (\n\n\u0394\n\nP\n\nh\nw\n\n\n=\n\u0394\n\nP\n\nf\nw\n\n\n\n). Fault intervals that are not exposed to reservoir depletion in any of the two fault blocks are assumed to maintain the initial pore pressure. Reservoir depletion is considered up to 30\u00a0MPa in this study, which implies that reservoir pressure is reduced up to 5.2\u00a0MPa\u00a0at the gas-water contact at 2995\u00a0m depth.\nThe total vertical stress gradient is 21.4\u00a0kPa\/m and is based on density log data representative of the Northern Netherlands. The minimum and maximum total horizontal stress in the reservoir formations is assumed to be 16.0\u00a0kPa\/m and 17.1\u00a0kPa\/m respectively. This implies a ratio between the minimum total horizontal and vertical stress of about \n\n\nk\n0\n\u2032\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a00.75 and a ratio of the two horizontal stress components of about 1.07. In this study, the cross-section in Fig. 2a is assumed to be perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress, so that the fault is exposed to the largest ambient shear stress.\nThe onset of fault slip is compared for two values for the cohesion C and friction angle \n\u03d5\n. In the normal-friction case, the friction angle is set to 31\u00b0 (friction coefficient of 0.6) in combination with a cohesion of 0\u00a0MPa, while in the low-friction case the friction angle is set to 10\u00b0 in combination with a cohesion of 7\u00a0MPa. In both cases the fault shear strength \n\n\n\u03c4\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n at 3000\u00a0m depth is about the same.\nA finite-element model generator was built for the DIANA software\n39\n to efficiently evaluate a large number of geometrical configurations with different thicknesses for various formations as outlined in Fig. 2a. The model generator identifies eight different horizontal formation layers, four on each side of the fault, that can be assigned thickness, density and mechanical failure properties independently. Thickness of the eight layers was assigned in correspondence with Fig. 2a, while reservoir offset was modelled by adjusting only the thickness of the overburden layer in the hanging wall. Reservoir thickness was evaluated by adjusting the thickness of the hanging wall and foot wall reservoir formations simultaneously.\nLinear plain strain continuum elements are used for all eight formation layers with identical linear-elastic properties (Young's modulus E\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0GPa, Poisson's ratio \u03bd\u00a0=\u00a00.25). This means that the shear modulus G is 4.0\u00a0GPa. Linear, one-dimensional interface elements are used to simulate fault slip behaviour (Fig. 3\nb). The normal and shear stress along the interface elements adheres to an elastic-perfect-plastic relationship with differential displacements \n\n\n(\n\n\nu\n\nx\nl\n\n\n\u2212\n\nu\n\nx\nr\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n and.\n\n\n(\n\n\nu\n\ny\nl\n\n\n\u2212\n\nu\n\ny\nr\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n.\n39,40\n The elastic normal and shear stiffness of the interface elements is taken identical to the Young's modulus and shear modulus of the continuum elements respectively.\nThe length of the interface elements is 1\u00a0m over the reservoir interval in order to accurately calculate the development of critical stress conditions in cases that include a reservoir offset. The size of the linear continuum elements next to the interface elements have the same height and increase in length towards the boundaries of the model. The fault zone and the four formations on each side can be recognised by the small element region in the middle of the model in Fig. 3. The top surface of the model has a zero stress boundary condition, while the normal displacements of the nodes along the two vertical sides and the bottom of the model are prohibited. The finite-element analysis comprise of a two-dimensional plane strain static analysis, in which reservoir depletion is simulated as pore pressure loading, applied in 30 increments of \u22121 MPa. Compressive stress is positive in this paper.\n\n\n\n3\nReactivations of faults intersecting reservoirs without offset\nIn section 3.1, the Base-case configuration, without reservoir offset as described in section 2.2, is evaluated for fault reactivation using the Mohr circle approach and in section 3.2 using the finite-element model.\n\n3.1\nThe Mohr-circle analysis results\nA Mohr-circle analysis was conducted for the stress condition on the fault plane in the reservoir interval at 2875\u00a0m depth under initial and depleted reservoir conditions. The green Mohr-circle in Fig. 4\n represents the initial effective stress condition at this depth and is determined by the vertical effective stress of 26.5\u00a0MPa and the minimum effective horizontal stress of 11.0\u00a0MPa (see section 2.2 for the stress gradients). The green dot on the green Mohr circle reflects the initial effective normal and shear stress condition on a fault plane dipping under 65\u00b0 with a horizontal plane. The initial SCU is 0.63 for the low-friction case with a friction angle of 10\u00b0 and a cohesion stress of 7\u00a0MPa (black solid line), while the SCU is 0.71 for the base case with a friction angle of 31\u00b0 (black dashed line).\nThe blue point on the blue Mohr-circle in Fig. 4 represents the fault stress condition at 2875\u00a0m depth after 19.9\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion and is calculated using equations (8) and (9) and a Poisson's ratio of 0.25 for the horizontal stress-path coefficient in equation (4). The vertical stress path coefficient is assumed to be zero. In the low-friction case, the SCU is 1 because the stress condition is on the Mohr-Coulomb shear failure line, implying that the fault reactivates (starts slipping). The SCU is 0.80 after 19.9\u00a0MPa depletion in the normal-friction case. Similar results have been obtained by other authors previously (e.g,\n38\n).\n\n\n3.2\nImpact of Poisson's ratio\nThe normal effective and shear stress condition on the fault plane at 2875\u00a0m depth progresses with increasing reservoir depletion along the path indicated by the light-green line in Fig. 5\na. Every subsequent marker along the stress path indicates an incremental depletion of 5\u00a0MPa. The light-green line for a Poisson's ratio \n\u03bd\n of 0.25 intersects the Mohr-Coulomb failure line for the low-friction case after 19.9\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion. The stress path is steeper for smaller values for Poisson's ratio in accordance with equations (4), (8) and (9), and requires a smaller reservoir depletion to intersect the failure line and cause onset of fault slip (slightly more than 10\u00a0MPa if a Poisson's ratio of 0.05 is assumed). Onset of fault slip is not reached up to a reservoir depletion of 30\u00a0MPa if Poisson's ratio is increased to a value larger than 0.30 for the low-friction case. For a friction angle of 31\u00b0 (dashed black line in\u00a0Fig. 5a), the Mohr-circle analysis only predicts fault reactivation for a reservoir depletion smaller than 30 MPa if Poisson's ratio is smaller than 0.25. The strong influence of Poisson's ratio on the reservoir depletion that causes fault reactivation is shown in Fig. 5b. The vertical axis is truncated at 30\u00a0MPa, because this is close to the maximum possible reservoir depletion.\n\n3.2.1\nImpact of fault inclination and minimum horizontal stress uncertainty\nThe initial stress condition, and thereby the starting point of the stress path, is influenced by the fault dip angle as indicate in Fig. 6\na. No shear stress is present on a vertical fault plane (dip angle 90\u00b0) under the assumed initial stress condition. The initial stress condition on a fault plane moves along the Mohr circle in clock-wise direction with decreasing dip angle and reaches the maximum initial shear stress under a dip angle of 45\u00b0 (green markers are plotted every 5\u00b0). It is noted that the stress paths are also influenced by the fault dip angle: the length of the stress path up to 30\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion is shorter for steeper fault planes. As a consequence, a fault dipping under 65\u00b0 starts slipping after slightly more than 10\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion if Poisson's ratio of the reservoir formation is 0.05, while a fault dipping under 80\u00b0 will remain in the elastic regime up to 30\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion in the same reservoir. This is also reflected in Fig. 5b, which shows that no fault slip is predicted within 30\u00a0MPa depletion for faults dipping steeper than about 75\u00b0.\nThe impact of the minimum horizontal stress on the stress path and the onset of fault slip is shown in Fig. 6b. The solid green circle represents the Base Case with a minimum effective horizontal stress of 16.0\u00a0kPa\/m (11.0\u00a0MPa\u00a0at 2875\u00a0m depth), whereas the smaller, dashed circle represents the case with a minimum horizontal stress gradient of 16.6\u00a0kPa\/m and the largest, dotted circle the case with a value of 15.4\u00a0kPa\/m. It is seen that the reservoir depletion required to cause fault reactivation increases with decreasing size of the Mohr circle (decreasing deviatoric stress, see also e.g.\n36\n).\n\n\n\n3.3\nFinite-element analysis results\nThe Base Case is also evaluated using the general purpose DIANA finite-element software that is commercially available.\n39\n The model with interface elements representing the fault, the loading and the boundary conditions are described in section 2.2. Fig. 7\na is identical to Fig. 2b and shows the prescribed pore pressure distribution for different depletion levels. The reservoir pressure is assumed to be equal in both fault blocks and is reduced in steps of 1\u00a0MPa from 35.2 to 5.2\u00a0MPa (reservoir depletion of 30\u00a0MPa). The evolution of the normal effective stress is shown in Fig. 7b and the evolution of the shear stress in Fig. 7c. Negative values for the shear stress indicate a down ward pointing shear stress on the foot wall formations, thereby confirming the normal faulting environment. The Shear Capacity Utilisation in Fig. 7d is calculated from the normal and shear stress in Fig. 7b\/c using equation (7), while assuming the low-friction case. Fault reactivation occurs if SCU\u00a0=\u00a01 in any interface element and is found at the same reservoir depletion of 19.9\u00a0MPa as in the Mohr circle analysis (section 3.1). Note that the fault SCU reaches a value of 1 almost at the same reservoir depletion over the entire reservoir depth interval. An inelastic relative slip displacement across the fault develops, adhering to the assumed elastic-perfect-plastic fault slip relationship, if depletion is increased beyond 19.9\u00a0MPa as shown in Fig. 7e. A maximum Relative Slip Displacement (RSD) of 0.079\u00a0m is calculated after 30\u00a0MPa depletion. Unlike the Mohr-circle analysis, the SCU remains 1 once the Mohr-Coulomb shear failure criterion is met, in accordance with the assumed plasticity rule in the finite-element model (section 2.2).\n\nFig. 8\na shows that the finite-element solution (green markers) exactly follows the same stress path as the analytical approach (light-green line) until the onset of fault slip occurs after 19.9\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion. At this depletion level, the maximum SCU reaches 1 (Fig. 8b). Upon further reservoir depletion, the stress path departs from the linear-elastic trend line and starts following the red Mohr-Coulomb failure line, adhering to the requirement that stress conditions above the failure line cannot exist. Fig. 8 also shows the shear failure line and SCU development corresponding with the normal-friction case, with a friction angle of 31\u00b0 and negligible cohesion. It is seen that fault reactivation does not occur even if reservoir depletion would reach 30\u00a0MPa, because the stress path runs virtually parallel to the failure line.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThe Mohr-circle analysis based on the low-friction case shows the strong influence of Poisson's ratio on the depletion pressure that causes onset of fault slip. A smaller Poisson's ratio implies a smaller lateral expansion of the depleting reservoir formation, and therefore a smaller increase of the horizontal effective stress due to reservoir depletion. This explains the steeper stress path and the smaller depletion pressure required to cause onset of fault slip. The normal-friction case shows that a realistic value for the friction angle in combination with a realistic value for Poisson's ratio does not lead to shear failure along a 65\u00b0 dipping fault plane. Fault reactivation along more steeply dipping faults is even less likely. A Mohr-circle analysis for the Groningen gas field, where the majority of the faults are dipping under an angle between 75 and 80\u00b0, would conclude that fault slip and induced seismicity is unlikely.\nThe Mohr-circle and finite-element analysis provide exactly the same reservoir depletion pressure for fault reactivation if a linear-elastic and homogenous subsurface is assumed, in which the fault does not offset the depleting reservoir. Identical results are also found when varying the fault dip and azimuth angle, Poisson's ratio and the initial stress conditions. Young's modulus does not have any impact on the stress distribution along the fault, because it does not appear in the stress-path coefficients in equation (3). The analytically derived stress path for uniaxial compacting reservoirs is accurate until the shear failure condition is met and onset of fault slip occurs. Under these assumptions, a Mohr-circle analysis is the preferred method for the calculation of fault reactivation, because it provides more insight into the response of the subsurface to reservoir depletion (or inflation), but also because it is much faster to evaluate, thereby facilitating the evaluation of uncertainties in all modelling parameters.\n8\n\n\n\n\n5\nReactivation of faults intersecting reservoirs with offset\nThe finite-element model is used to evaluate the depletion pressure that causes fault reactivation in reservoirs with offset. To this end, the overburden thickness of the hanging wall is increased, while keeping the depth of the foot wall reservoir and all other modelling parameters the same as in the Base Case (section 2.2). The results for the case with 80\u00a0m reservoir offset is discussed in detail in section 5.1, while the fault reactivation pressures for a large number of reservoir offsets between \u2212300 (up-thrown) and +500\u00a0m (down-thrown) are presented in section 5.2. The results are compared with the Mohr-circle evaluation for the case without offset.\n\n5.1\nCase study: 80\u00a0m reservoir offset\nThe stress distribution along the fault plane is discussed for the case in which the hanging wall reservoir is 80\u00a0m deeper than the foot wall reservoir. Similar to the Base Case, reservoir depletion is equal in both fault blocks and is increased in steps of 1\u00a0MPa up to 30\u00a0MPa.\n\nFig. 9\na shows that the fault is exposed to reservoir depletion over a larger depth interval due to the fault offset. This reflects the assumption that the fault pore pressure follows the pressure of adjacent formation. The normal effective stress (Fig. 9b) is significantly smaller over the juxtaposed reservoir interval where the fault is exposed to reservoir depletion on both sides, compared to the intervals that are exposed to depletion in either the foot wall or hanging wall reservoir only. The shear stress and SCU distribution (Fig. 9c and d respectively) show peak values at the top of the hanging wall reservoir and at the bottom of the foot wall reservoir. The small peak value at the top of the hanging wall is caused by the larger gas pressure in the foot wall reservoir compared to the hydrostatic pore pressure in the overburden above the hanging wall. Onset of fault slip occurs when SCU\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0at the bottom of the foot wall after 5.9\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion slightly before fault slip starts at the top of the hanging wall. Furthermore, it is noticed that the shear stress and SCU is reducing due to reservoir depletion at the top of the foot wall and at the bottom of the hanging wall. This means that the fault stress condition becomes less critical at these locations due to reservoir depletion. The relative slip displacement in Fig. 9e is negligible and elastic (recoverable) until onset of fault slip occurs after 5.9\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion.\n\nFig. 10\nb shows the stress paths at different locations along the fault plane due to increasing reservoir depletion. The locations are indicated in Fig. 10a, which also shows the SCU distribution along the fault plane after 0 and 6\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion (similar to Fig. 9d). After 6\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion, a small slip patch has appeared at the bottom of the foot wall reservoir where SCU\u00a0=\u00a01. This is confirmed by the position of the second marker of the purple line in Fig. 10b, which lies on the Mohr-Coulomb failure line specified by a cohesion of 7\u00a0MPa and a friction angle of 10\u00b0. The (red) stress path at the top of the hanging wall (at \u22122910\u00a0m) reaches the shear failure criterion at a slightly larger depletion pressure, as the third marker (representing 7\u00a0MPa depletion).\nThe other three stress paths in Fig. 10b are significantly less critical. In particular, the green and blue stress paths, which represents the points at the top and bottom of the reservoir interval at \u22122830\u00a0m and \u22123125\u00a0m depth respectively, develop a reverse shear stress condition with increasing reservoir depletion. This is also seen by the changing sign of the shear stress in Fig. 9c. A positive shear stress means that an upward shear stress is exerted on the foot wall formations. Also, the yellow stress path for the point at 2875\u00a0m depth is less critical compared to the stress path for the case without offset shown in Fig. 5a (light-green line for Poisson's ratio \n\u03bd\n\u00a0=\u00a00.25).\n\nFig. 11\n shows the increasing total length of the slip patches (red line) and the maximum slip displacement (yellow line) with increasing reservoir depletion. Two slip patches develop along the fault plane after the onset of fault slip at 5.9\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion. This is recognised by the two intervals where SCU\u00a0=\u00a01 (light-blue line) in Fig. 9d. The total length of the two slip patches accelerates with incremental depletion until they merge after about 12\u00a0MPa depletion, covering the entire juxtaposed interval. Thereafter, the slip patch extension continues at a slower pace with incremental depletion over the shallower part of the foot wall, and the deeper part of the hanging wall. Furthermore, Fig. 11 shows a gradual increase of the maximum relative (inelastic) slip displacement up to 0.25\u00a0m after 30\u00a0MPa depletion (see also Fig. 9e).\n\n\n5.2\nFault re-activation as a function of reservoir offset\nIn a similar way, the stress and slip distribution along the fault plane has been evaluated for a large number of cases with a reservoir offset between \u2212300 (up-thrown) and +500\u00a0m (down-thrown). Note, however, that the initial stress conditions are the same in all cases, reflecting a normal faulting regime. For each case, the reservoir depletion that causes onset of fault slip has been determined assuming a friction angle of 10\u00b0 and a cohesion of 7\u00a0MPa (the low-friction case).\n\nFig. 12\n shows the reservoir depletion as a function of the normalised reservoir offset, which is defined as the absolute reservoir offset divided by the reservoir thickness (215\u00a0m in the Base Case). Fig. 12 shows that fault reactivation occurs at substantially smaller depletion pressures in cases with offset compared to the Base Case without offset. A Mohr-circle evaluation represents the case without offset, in which fault reactivation occurs after 19.9\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion. Fault reactivation occurs at a decreasing depletion pressure with increasing offset of the hanging wall. The smallest depletion pressure is found if the normalised reservoir offset is 1, which is if the offset is equal to the reservoir thickness. The depletion pressure increases again for an offset larger than the reservoir thickness. The depletion pressure required to cause fault reactivation is also significantly smaller than found in the Mohr-circle analysis is cases with negative offset, where the hanging wall is shallower than the foot wall. For the assumed fault orientation, fault strength and initial stress condition it is found that reactivation may be only 30% (5.9\u00a0MPa) of the reservoir depletion calculated using the Mohr-circle analysis (19.9\u00a0MPa) depending on the reservoir offset.\n\n\n5.3\nThe influence of reservoir thickness on fault re-activation in depleting reservoirs with offset\nThe series of analyses for a reservoir thickness of 215\u00a0m discussed in section 4.2 were repeated for a thickness of 165\u00a0m and 265\u00a0m. This range largely covers the thickness of the depleting reservoir formations across the Groningen gas field. The absolute reservoir offset was varied for each series of analyses such that the normalised reservoir offset covered the range between \u22121 (up-thown) and +2 (down-thrown). All other modelling parameters were taken to be the same as in Chapter 4 (i.e. fault dip and azimuth angle are 65 and 90\u00b0 respectively).\n\nFig. 12 shows that the depletion pressure required to cause onset of fault slip is dependent on the normalised reservoir offset (absolute offset divided by reservoir thickness), but not on the reservoir thickness. This implies that the incremental normal and shear stress distribution along the fault plane induced by reservoir depletion scales proportionally with the reservoir thickness. Also, the length of the slip patch and the (maximum) slip displacement scale proportional with the reservoir thickness.\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nThe importance of a small element size\nIn this section, the element size requirement for an accurate computation of the reservoir depletion pressure that causes fault reactivation in finite-element analyses is evaluated. The shear stress concentration at the top and bottom of the foot wall and hanging wall reservoir formations require sufficiently small elements to be captured accurately. In particular, for three-dimensional finite-element analyses it is important to balance meaningful results (small element sizes) with computational effort (large element sizes). To illustrate this, a case describing a 140\u00a0m thick reservoir with a bounding fault dipping under 65\u00b0 is evaluated (Fig. 13\n) using an element size ranging from 0.5\u00a0m to 50\u00a0m. So far, results are obtained using an element size of 1\u00a0m along the depleting reservoir, whereas it is not uncommon that only a few elements over the reservoir height are used in 3D analyses.\n28,32,42,43\n\n\nThe model in Fig. 13 has different elastic properties for the reservoir layers, the top seal and overburden formations, while the fault friction angle is 31\u00b0 and the cohesion is 0\u00a0MPa. The reservoir is situated in a normal stress regime with the total minimum horizontal stress being 72% of the vertical stress. Pore pressure is slightly over-pressured at 11.66\u00a0kPa\/m, with a gas pressure gradient in the reservoir of 1.8\u00a0kPa\/m, similar to specified in section 2.2. The objective is to determine the maximum element size that allows for an accurate assessment of the depletion pressure that causes fault reactivation. The 140\u00a0m reservoir formations in Fig. 13 are evaluated using an element size of 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1 and 0.5\u00a0m in the vertical direction. The horizontal size of the elements is also adjusted to maintain an aspect ratio of less than 2 close to the fault.\n\nFig. 14\na shows that the element size does not influence the pore pressure loading on the fault. In this particular case, reservoir pore pressure is decreased from about 35\u00a0MPa to 5\u00a0MPa in the foot wall reservoir only (right-hand side of the fault). The normal effective stress on the fault over the reservoir interval (Fig. 14b) increases due to depletion. However, the largest element size of 50\u00a0m only captures the gradient and absolute value over about a third of the reservoir height. The shear stress concentration at the top and bottom of the reservoir interval (Fig. 14c) is not well captured for an element size larger than 10\u00a0m. The peak value increases with smaller element size, but the difference in shear stress can be as large as 12\u00a0MPa. The Shear Capacity Utilisation (Fig. 14d) shows onset of fault slip at 9.0\u00a0MPa reservoir depletion for an element size smaller or equal than 2\u00a0m (see also Fig. 15\n). For a larger element size, onset of fault slip is found at an increasing depletion pressure, while no fault slip is calculated in case of an element size of 50\u00a0m.\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\nThe stress distribution along the fault plane can be determined by superposition of the incremental stress caused by depletion in both the foot wall and hanging wall. In a normal faulting environment, this leads to an increase of shear stress at the top of the hanging wall reservoir and at the bottom of the foot wall reservoir (Figs. 9 and 14). This study shows that fault reactivation occurs at these locations. The peak values in the shear stress distribution vanish in the absence of reservoir offset. This explains why a substantially larger reservoir depletion is required to cause fault reactivation in cases without offset. The main reason why a Mohr-circle evaluation estimates a depletion pressure which is too high is because the evaluation does not consider reservoir offset and is not conducted for the most critical point along the fault plane. The reason why a normalised reservoir offset of 1 requires the smallest reservoir depletion to cause fault reactivation is because the shear stress peak at the top of the hanging wall coincides with the shear stress peak at the bottom of the foot wall.\nOn the other hand, the shear stress is reduced at the top foot wall and at the bottom of the hanging wall. A similar shear stress distribution is found along the vertical edges of a rectangular depleting reservoir.\n44\n This reduced shear stress provides a barrier for fault slip propagation outside the depth interval of the fault that is exposed to reservoir depletion (Fig. 9c\/d). This is also found in other studies.\n45\n\n\nSome of the modelling assumptions in the finite-element analysis influence the magnitude of the shear stress concentration and thereby the depletion pressure that causes fault reactivation. The discontinuous pore pressure between the depleting and the non-depleting reservoir formations across the fault can be expected to be more gradual when incorporating formation and fault permeability as shown by Zbinden et al.\n34\n Also, the normal and shear stiffness of the interface elements influence the computed shear stress concentration along the fault plane and can be used to account for the width of the fault core and damage zone.\n46\n Despite these modelling assumption, this study demonstrates that the shear stress along a fault plane is not uniformly changing over the depletion interval when the reservoir is offset along a fault plane or when the depletion occurs on one side of the fault only. For these cases, a Mohr-circle evaluation based on stress-path coefficients as outlined in the introduction provides an underestimation of the depletion pressure that causes fault reactivation. The observed induced seismicity in the Groningen gas field\n41,45,46\n and the inability of a Mohr circle analysis to predict fault reactivation provides further support for this finding.\n\nFig. 12 demonstrates that the normal and shear stress distribution scales with the reservoir thickness for given normalised reservoir offset. This implies that the minimum size for linear elements to accurately calculate of the onset of fault slip can also be scaled to the reservoir thickness as considered in section 5. The results therefore suggests that 3D geomechanical models with a vertical element size of more than about 2% of the reservoir height are not able to accurately capture fault reactivation in cases with offset. An element size of more than 30% of the reservoir thickness may even miss the possible onset of fault slip.\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that a Mohr-circle analysis under-estimates the risk of induced fault reactivation in depleting reservoirs that contain faults with offset. Practically, this statement holds for any mapped fault, as formation offset is a prerequisite for the recognition of faults through seismic interpretation. The explanation for this under-estimation is found in the fact that a Mohr-circle evaluation does not consider the most critically-stressed fault location, which are located at the top of the hanging wall and at the bottom of the foot wall reservoir in a normally stressed environment. The case with an offset equal to the reservoir thickness constitutes the most susceptible configuration for fault reactivation and requires the smallest reservoir depletion. We also conclude that reservoir depletion on one side of the fault does not constitute the worst-case scenario as explained by cases with a very large (positive or negative) offset (see Fig. 12). In stead, a reservoir offset equal to the reservoir thickness and depletion on both sides of the fault constitutes the worst-case scenario. In the current study, the required pressure drop or depletion is only 30% of the reservoir depletion computed using a Mohr-circle evaluation representing the case without offset. A Mohr-circle evaluation should therefore be avoided in hazard analysis as it provides a non-conservative result.\nThe occurrence of shear stress concentration at the top and bottom of depleting reservoirs also imposes a requirement for the minimum element size in 2D and 3D finite-element evaluation. This study shows that the normal and shear stress distribution along the fault plane scales with reservoir thickness for given normalised reservoir offset. A vertical element size of more than about 2% over the reservoir height is not able to accurately capture fault reactivation in cases with offset. An element size of more than 30% of the reservoir thickness may even overlook the onset of fault slip.\n\n","18":"","19":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe potential for activation of faults and fractures in low permeability argillaceous (compacted) claystone or shale is relevant to a number of geo-energy activities, such as to ensure caprock integrity of geologic sequestration sites,\n1\n for improved stimulation and production from shale gas reservoirs,\n2\u20134\n and for safe permanent geologic disposal of nuclear waste in argillaceous clay formations.\n5\n The main concern associated with nuclear waste disposal is the potential for repository induced or natural perturbations to create permeable flow paths through the initially impermeable host rock barrier. If such a flow path is created and remains open permanently, it could provide a transport path for radionuclides if released from a waste package.\nIn geologic nuclear waste disposal in argillaceous clay, fault activation may be caused by repository-scale thermally-driven stress changes and so-called thermal pressurization.\n6\n\n,\n\n7\n Thermal pressurization is a process of pressure increase by thermal expansion of pore-fluids trapped within pores of the low permeability host rock (Fig. 1\n). If not carefully managed by an appropriate repository design, the repository temperature and associated thermal pressurization could become so high that it could potentially cause hydraulic fracturing or shear activation of existing fractures and minor faults.\n8\n The impact of such thermal pressurization with respect to shear activation is two-fold in that it can (1) reduce the effective stress and shear strength of fractures (or faults), and (2) increase the shear stress across fractures (or faults) (Fig. 1). Other potential causes of fault activation or fracturing of a low permeability host rock include gas generation within the engineered barrier system of a repository\n9\n or seismic motion from a distant earthquake.\n10\n Distant earthquakes produce dynamic strains that give rise to pore pressure changes\n11\n that could potentially trigger shear slip on faults that are stressed near instability.\n12\n\n\nIn this article we present results from an international modeling comparison study of controlled fault activation experiments that were conducted in Opalinus Clay at the Mont Terri Laboratory, Switzerland.\n13\u201315\n The study was part of the international collaborative project DECOVALEX-2019 (from 2015 to 2019) where it was denoted Task B.\n16\n While this article aims at synthesizing some of the most important results and findings related to interpretative modeling of observed hydromechanical fault behavior, a complete coverage of all the results and model comparisons are reported in Graupner et al.\n17\n In the next section of this article, we introduce the DECOVALEX-2019 Task B, the international modeling teams and their models. This is followed by results from an initial benchmark model exercise, before presenting the modeling of two controlled fault activation experiments at Mont Terri. We end with a discussion on the results and conclusions with implications to nuclear waste disposal in argillaceous clay formations.\n\n\n2\nDECOVALEX-2019 TASK B description\nThe objectives of DECOVALEX-2019, Task B, were to develop, compare and validate models for fault hydromechanical behavior in argillaceous clay (shale) formations, relevant to deep underground nuclear waste disposal.\n16\n\n,\n\n17\n The main task was to develop models and perform interpretative modeling of water-injection fault activation experiments at the Mont Terri Laboratory. The model simulations focused on (1) one experiment activating a discontinuity (fracture or minor fault) within the damage zone of the Main Fault, and (2) a second experiment activating discontinuities close to the core of the Main Fault. The experimental data from these fault activation experiments consist of flow, pore pressure and three-dimensional fault displacement continuously monitored at an injection borehole and a monitoring borehole located a few meters away.\nIn DECOVALEX-2019, Task B, the modeling teams were tasked to conduct modeling in three steps of increasing complexity:\n\n\u2022\nStep 1 - Model inception and benchmarking using a simplified setup\n\n\n\u2022\nStep 2 - Modeling fault activation experiment in the fault damage zone, and\n\n\n\u2022\nStep 3 - Modeling fault activation experiment at the fault core\n\n\n\nThe Step 1 benchmarking involved modeling of a single discontinuity, a simplified version of the Step 2 fault activation experiment, whereas Step 3 involved modeling of several connected discontinuities. Here we use the term discontinuity as a general term that includes fractures, faults (fractures or discontinuities with previous shear offset), bedding planes, as well as interfaces between rock units, such as the discontinuity that may exist between a fault core and surround rock.\nThe objective of Step 1 was to provide modeling teams with a well-defined benchmark exercise considering a detailed specification of the discontinuity plane, including a pre-defined hydromechanical model with clearly specified material properties and model geometry. This was intended as a model inception for the modeling teams to familiarize themselves with the problem and allow for necessary model developments and testing. During the course of the three-year project (2015\u20132019), more benchmarks were defined, including uncoupled flow problems that were used to help the teams identifying technical issues with their models.\n17\n\n\nStep 2 and 3 were focused on interpretative modeling of the actual field experiments and in addition to providing model valuation they are modeled to advance our understanding of fault activation processes based on measured data. Both of these experiments involved activation of discontinuities at the scale of a few meters, within the Main Fault (Fig. 2\n). The activation experiments were carried out by water injection into isolated borehole sections (2.4\u00a0m in length) that were intersected by a number of discontinuities of various types and orientations. These boreholes were drilled vertically downward from a tunnel in the Mont Terri Laboratory, with the borehole test sections far enough away from the tunnel to avoid any related stress perturbation. Stepwise increases in borehole pressure were imposed until the pressure was sufficiently high to cause an activation of one or several of the discontinuities. Injection rate, fluid pressure and three-dimensional borehole deformations were measured at high frequency with a specialized borehole monitoring equipment.\n13\n\n,\n\n14\n\n,\n\n18\n A protocol for measurements with this borehole monitoring equipment was described in Guglielmi et al.\n18\n The protocol was presented as an International Society of Rock Mechanics (ISRM) suggested method for step-rate injection method for fracture in-situ properties (SIMFIP). The two fault activation experiments are further described in Sections 5 and 6 related to the Step 2 and Step 3 modeling activities.\n\n\n3\nModeling teams and numerical simulators\nSeven modeling teams of the DECOVALEX-2019 initiative participated in analyzing the experimental data using different modeling approaches and computer codes (Table 1\n). The fault activation models can be categorized into models representing a fault by an interface and models representing a fault by finite thickness solid elements. In all models, the fault geometry is simplified as a plane cutting the entire model. The differences between interface and solid element representations of faults are conceptually described in Fig. 3\n. That is, a fracture or fault represented by an interface or discontinuity explicitly models normal and shear displacements as a function of changes in effective normal and shear stress.\n13\n\n,\n\n19\u201324\n Transmissivity for fracture flow can be directly related to fracture aperture through the parallel plate flow assumption.\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n For a finite thickness solid element representation of a fracture or fault, a fracture aperture is considered implicitly within the element thickness and equivalent properties are calculated to represent fracture stiffness and flow transmissivity.\n27\u201332\n This includes equivalent elastic modulus and permeability, both of which may involve anisotropy through constitutive models. Another variant is the linking of mechanical codes representing fractures or faults with interface elements to porous media flow in finite thickness elements.\n33\n\n,\n\n34\n\n\nA diverse set of numerical simulators (or computer codes) where applied in this study (Table 1). The TOUGH-FLAC simulator\n35\n\n,\n\n36\n used by KIGAM and LBNL is based on sequential coupling of the TOUGH2 multiphase flow simulator\n37\n with the FLAC3D geomechanical simulator.\n38\n TOUGH-FLAC has previously been extensively applied for modeling fault activation associated with carbon sequestration,\n39\n\n,\n\n40\n stimulation of shale gas, and geothermal reservoirs,\n41\n\n,\n\n42\n and during production from hydrocarbon reservoirs.\n43\n For the finite thickness fault element approach, an anisotropic elasto-plastic model is used such that shear failure occurs along the fault plane, considering normal and shear stress across the fault. This is based on the so-called ubiquitous joint model available as a constitutive relationship in FLAC3D, considering failure along weak planes.\n38\n KIGAM applied both finite thickness elements and interface elements to represent the fault mechanical behavior in TOUGH-FLAC. In the case of interface elements, KIGAM developed new coupling routines between TOUGH2 and FLAC3D through fracture mesh aperture changes calculated in FLAC3D.\n22\n\n\nOpenGeoSys (OGS) is an open source finite element simulator\n44\n\n,\n\n45\n that was applied by the BGR\/UFZ and ENSI research teams, respectively using interface and solid element fault models. BGR\/UFZ extended OGS towards the capability of dealing with discrete approaches for the simulation of hydraulic fracturing and fault activation. To this end, lower-dimensional interface (LIE) elements with local enrichments have been implemented in OGS.\n23\n\n,\n\n46\n The ENSI research team developed and implemented into OGS an elasto-plastic constitutive model that includes sliding failure along weak planes.\n32\n\n\nTwo modeling teams, INER and LBNL, developed models for the fault activation simulations using 3DEC, a code that is based on the Distinct Element Method (DEM). 3DEC handles coupled fluid flow and geomechanics by considering fractures or faults represented by interfaces between deformable blocks.\n47\n\n,\n\n48\n Finally, the DynaFrax team applied a three-dimensional (3D) particle flow code (namely, Particle Flow Code 3D, PFC3D) to model fault activation.\n49\n This is also based on DEM, with faults formed between particles through variable bond strength and porous media fluid flow.\n50\n DynaFrax researchers have in this task extended their particle-flow fault activation modeling to full 3D from previous work in 2D.\n51\n\n\nIn all of the above models, whether finite thickness solid elements or interfaces, a Coulomb criterion was used to evaluate shear failure.\n52\n As an exception, CNSC considered shear failure using a Drucker-Prager yield criterion.\n31\n CNSC calculated permeability evolution based on the elastic and plastic strain normal to the finite thickness fracture plane model, including a damage enhancement factor to enhance the effect of plastic normal strain on fracture permeability.\n31\n This fault activation model was implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics\n53\n for fully coupled hydromechanical modeling.\n\n\n4\nStep 1 - model inception and benchmarking\nA set of well-defined benchmark calculations was first defined to allow for necessary model developments and testing related to fault activation modeling.\n17\n As opposed to Steps 2 and 3, here the modeling problem is exactly specified, from the model geometry to the rock properties and constitutive relationships such as the fault permeability as a function of aperture and shear. In contrast, in Steps 2 and 3, modeling teams were expected to move from simple benchmarking to complex conceptual model building and comparison of model results with the field experiments.\nIn the benchmark, the model geometry was defined to broadly represent the geometry and stress conditions for the subsequent Step 2 fault activation experiment. A 3D model domain was defined to have side-lengths of 20\u00a0m and to contain a discontinuity dipping at 65\u00b0 (Fig. 4\n). The initial fluid pressure is set to 0.5\u00a0MPa, as estimated from site-specific measurements in the Mont Terri Laboratory. The stress field, somewhat simplified from current site-specific estimates\n54\n, assumes that the maximum compressive principal stress is exactly vertical at a magnitude of 7.0\u00a0MPa, whereas the intermediate principal stress (and maximum horizontal stress) is oriented exactly normal to the strike of the fault at a magnitude of 6.0\u00a0MPa. The minimum horizontal stress is parallel to the strike of the fault at a magnitude of 3.3\u00a0MPa, but because it is parallel to the fault this stress does not impact the potential for fault activation. For simplicity, the pressure and stress fields are assumed to be uniform over the 20\u00a0m cube domain, neglecting gravity. The outer boundaries of the 20\u00a0m cube model are defined to be held at constant fluid pressure of 0.5\u00a0MPa and mechanically the displacements normal to each boundary are fixed to zero (roller boundaries). The benchmark injection is conducted in controlled pressure steps as shown in Fig. 5\n. This injection schedule is the same as was applied in the field during the Step 2 fault activation experiment. A number of monitoring points and profiles were defined for comparison of simulation results between the different teams.\n17\n Here we focus comparison on injection rate, deformation at the injection borehole and pore pressure at monitoring point P2 located within the fault plane at 1.5\u00a0m radius from the injection point (Fig. 4). Borehole deformations where evaluated from relative anchor displacements corresponding to Fig. 2e and with coordinates of anchors defined in Fig. 4b.\nThe benchmark host rock properties are listed in Table 2\n. These properties are representative of the Mont Terri Laboratory, but simplified in the sense that isotropic and homogeneous properties are assumed over the model domain except for the fault discontinuity. For example, mechanical properties are assumed to be linear elastic and isotropic with a bulk modulus of 5.9\u00a0GPa and a shear modulus of 2.3\u00a0GPa, which represent average values at the Mont Terri Laboratory.\n54\n\n,\n\n55\n Moreover, the host rock is considered impermeable, which is reasonable considering the very low permeability of undisturbed Opalinus Clay and the relative short duration of these experiments.\nIn these benchmark simulations, a single fault or fracture plane is defined with opening as a result of changes in effective stress assuming a linear elastic normal stiffness, but with a tensile strength of 0\u00a0MPa. That is, effective normal stress is governed by (assuming compressive stress is positive)\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u2212\nP\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c3\u2032\n\nn\n and \u03c3\n\nn\n are effective and total normal stresses [Pa], respectively, and P is fluid pressure [Pa].\nShear displacement is assumed to be governed by a linear elastic shear stiffness and a shear strength according to the Coulomb criterion. Based on site investigations at Mont Terri and some initial test simulations, the friction angle was set to 22\u00b0 with a cohesion equal to 0.\nFluid flow along the fault is governed by Darcy's law with cubic dependency between flow rate and hydraulic conducting aperture, i.e. the fluid flow per unit width is calculated as\n\n(2)\n\n\nq\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\nb\nh\n3\n\n\u03c1\ng\n\n\n12\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u2207\nh\n\n\n\nwhere b\n\nh\n is hydraulic conducting aperture [m], \u03c1 is fluid density [kg\/m3], g is the acceleration due to gravity [m\/s2], h is hydraulic head [m], \u03bc is dynamic fluid viscosity [Pa s], and \u2207 is the gradient operator. For simplicity, it is assumed that the hydraulic conducting aperture is equal to a mechanical aperture with the change in fracture aperture being equal to fracture normal displacement.\nThe hydraulic aperture is comprised of an initial aperture [m], b\n\nhi\n, an induced fracture creation aperture [m], \u0394b\n\nhc\n, an induced elastic aperture change [m], \u0394b\n\nhe\n, and an induced aperture change due to shear dilation [m], \u0394b\n\nhs\n, according to:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nb\nh\n\n=\n\nb\n\nh\ni\n\n\n+\n\u0394\n\nb\n\nh\nc\n\n\n+\n\u0394\n\nb\n\nh\ne\n\n\n+\n\u0394\n\nb\n\nh\ns\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo different models or parameter sets are applied for dealing with shear-induced hydraulic aperture changes, and associated changes in fracture transmissivity.\n\nFM1: An elastic (normal) and plastic (shear) opening of the fault is only possible when shear failure occurs.\n\nFM2: An already existing aperture of the fracture, where elastic (normal) opening is allowed from the beginning with propagating pore pressure, while shear (dilatant) opening is only possible when shear failure occurs.\nFM1 (Fault Model 1) is defined based on experience with modeling similar fault activation experiments at the Tournemire site in Southern France.\n56\n It is a simple model, but one that reasonably reproduced measured responses at the Tournemire site. In this model, as soon as shear- or tensile-failure occur, an induced change in aperture of \u0394b\n\nhc\n\u00a0=\u00a028\u00a0\u03bcm occurs, signifying that an open fault surface has been created. The value of \u0394b\n\nhc\n\u00a0=\u00a028\u00a0\u03bcm comes from the modeling and evaluation of similar field experiments at the Tournemire site.\n56\n Thereafter, the fracture can respond as a function of effective normal stress [Pa], \u03c3\n\nn\n, depending on the fracture normal stiffness [Pa\/m], k\n\nn\n, according to:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u0394\n\nb\n\nh\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\u2032\n\n\n\/\n\nk\nn\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relations used in FM1 were applied by Guglielmi et al.\n56\n at the Tournemire site because measurements indicated substantial permeability increases with shear displacement despite an apparent lack of shear dilation.\nThe second fault model (FM2) could be viewed as a more conventional hydromechanical fracture model in which hydraulic aperture is equal to the mechanical aperture that in turn depends on opening as a result of reduction in effective stress, fracturing, and shear dilation governed by\n\n(5)\n\n\n\u0394\n\nb\n\nh\ns\n\n\n=\n\nu\ns\n\n\u00d7\ntan\n\n\u03c6\n\u22c5\n,\n\n\n\nwhere u\n\ns\n is shear displacement [m] and \u03d5 is the dilation angle [\u00b0], which in FM2 is set to 10\u00b0.\nThe model parameters for FM1 and FM2 are listed in Table 2. These parameter values have been developed from the site investigations at the Mont Terri Laboratory, including laboratory and field testing.\n54\n\n,\n\n55\n Therefore, the parameters listed in Table 2 were used as a starting point for the subsequent Step 2 and Step 3 modeling.\n\nFig. 4b shows a view of the fault plane for FM1. The figure shows that an initial fracture exists around the well to a radius of 0.5\u00a0m which has an aperture equal to the creation aperture of 28\u00a0\u03bcm. In the case of FM2, a uniform initial aperture of 10\u00a0\u03bcm exists in the entire fault plane from the injection point to the outer boundaries. The 28\u00a0\u03bcm creation aperture is taken from Guglielmi et al.,\n56\n whereas the 10\u00a0\u03bcm initial aperture is arbitrarily defined as a small initial aperture for the benchmark calculations. These differences in the fault hydromechanical models cause strongly different hydromechanical behavior between FM1 and FM2.\nEach of the modeling teams listed in Table 1 used their respective numerical simulators to build the models according to the benchmark description. For comparison of the modeling results between the teams, a number of monitoring points and profiles were defined. These included the injection flow rate, as well as the pressure at the injection point (P1) and the monitoring point (P2) located 1.5\u00a0m from the injection. Moreover, the relative displacements between two points bracing the fault vertically at the injection point were compared corresponding to a SIMFIP measurement (Figs. 2e and 4b). Such output results and comparison between the modeling teams are shown in Figs. 6 and 7\n\n for FM1 and FM2, respectively.\nIn the case of FM1, an abrupt increase in the injection flow rate (Fig. 6a) and pressure at the monitoring point P2 (Fig. 6b) occurs after about 420\u00a0s. This is followed by an abrupt decrease after around 450\u00a0s. These abrupt flow and pressure responses are a result of the fault hydromechanical model assumed for FM1. Before 420\u00a0s, the initial 0.5\u00a0m radius fracture is pressurized step-wise which causes elastic fracture opening locally, as observed in the calculated anchor displacements (Fig. 6c) and normal displacements (Fig. 6d). At about 420\u00a0s, the pressure is sufficiently high to cause the rupture to propagate from the initial 0.5\u00a0m radius to and past the monitoring point P2 located at a radius of 1.5\u00a0m. Along with this rupture propagation, shear failure and shear slip occur, as was calculated by most models (Fig. 6d). At 450\u00a0s, the injection pressure is stepped down, the fracture closes, and the injection flow rate decreases to a small value.\nIn the case of FM2, the hydromechanical response of the fault follows the step-wise increase and subsequent decrease of the injection pressure (Fig. 7). This behavior reflects the FM2 fault hydromechanical model where a fracture with an initial aperture of 10\u00a0\u03bcm exists that connects the injection point at P1 with the monitoring point at P2. Thus, the injection flow rate (Fig. 7a) increases with each injection pressure step at P1 as a result of increasing pressure gradient and permeability caused by fracture opening, and a pressure increase at P2 is recorded almost immediately after each increase at P1. At the peak injection pressure of 6.3\u00a0MPa, shear failure occurs with some calculated shear slip for most models (Fig. 7d).\nOverall, the different models applied to this benchmark show a general agreement in the modeling results regarding the activation mechanisms and trends, though some discrepancies occur, especially for FM1. In the case of FM1, the agreement is very good during the first 420\u00a0s, when pressurization of the existing fracture around the injection point results in elastic opening. The timing of the rupture and flow increase is also in good agreement. However, the extent of rupture propagation, the magnitude of shear slip, and the total injection volume differ significantly for some models. Two teams, BGR and KIGAM, did not achieve rupture propagation all the way to P2 and consequently no pressure increases occurred at P2 (Fig. 7b). The two teams that used the DEM code 3DEC calculated much larger shear slip displacements than other teams. Also in the case of FM2, the biggest disagreement between the modeling results occurs for the shear slip magnitude towards the end of the simulation (Fig. 7d). This shows that the greatest model uncertainty will be on the modeling of shear slip, whether slip does occur and if so what it\u2019s magnitude will be. Shear failure is a hydromechanical response that can depend on very small differences in shear stress and shear strength on the fault. These evolve over time and are sensitive to modeling choices, such as the mesh discretization or the fault modeling approach, including interface versus finite thickness elements. In FM2, some disagreement also occur in the flow rate response (Fig. 7a), which is affected by the very sensitive cubic-law relationship between flow rate and aperture.\n\n\n5\nStep 2 \u2013 modeling activation experiment in the fault damage zone\nIn the following subsections, we first present the Step 2 field experiment and data with some general observations and interpretations, followed by the models and their parametrizations, and finally the model results with comparison between simulated and experimental data.\n\n5.1\nField experimental data\nThe Step 2 fault activation experiment was conducted by fluid injection into a 2.4-m long isolated injection chamber of borehole BFS2 with monitoring of fluid pressure responses in borehole BFS4 located at a horizontal distance of 1.5\u00a0m (Fig. 2 and 8). Guglielmi et al.\n14\n describes 12 discontinuity planes intersecting the injection chamber of BFS2 being pressurized during the experiment (Fig. 8\n). Most of these discontinuities strike N030\u00b0-060\u00b0E and dip 50\u201370\u00b0SE and thus one or several of these discontinuities could be opened and activated during the borehole pressurization. Also, the monitoring borehole BFS4 is located along the strike of those discontinuities and signals measured there can indicate when flow paths form along one or more of these discontinuities (Fig. 8c). The stress field estimated at the Mont Terri Laboratory\n54\n\n,\n\n57\u201359\n is oriented such that the maximum stress is approximately vertical at a magnitude of 6\u20137\u00a0MPa, while the intermediate principal stress is approximately horizontal at 4\u20135\u00a0MPa and oriented approximately perpendicular to the average strike of the discontinuities observed in the BFS2 borehole section (Fig. 8a and b).\nThe specific injection cycle analyzed for Step 2 was the first of several injection cycles performed using an electric motor pump. However, this borehole interval had previously been pressurized using a hand pump, which resulted in a fracture created along an intersecting discontinuity plane. This fracture corresponds to the created fracture shown in Fig. 4 for the FM1 benchmark example, which indicates that activation must have been initiated along one of the discontinuities (weakness planes) intersecting the injection interval. The motor pump injection would result in further propagation of this initial fracture to beyond the monitoring well according to the conceptual model in Fig. 8c.\n\nFig. 9\n presents the field data during this injection experiment in which the injection pressure followed the schedule similar to the one shown in Fig. 5. Injection flowrate, injection chamber pressure and borehole displacements were monitored at a 500\u00a0Hz sampling frequency. The borehole deformations were measured between anchors, fixed to the borehole wall in a 0.5\u00a0m vertical section of the injection borehole (Fig. 2). Thus, the deformation measurements are anchored within the central part of the injection chamber. The anchor displacements shown in Fig. 9b are the displacements of the upper anchor relative to the lower anchor, in vertical up, northern and western directions. Moreover, the relative displacements shown in Fig. 9b have been corrected to filter out elastic deformations of the equipment and injection chamber in order to deduce the displacement of the discontinuity itself.\n15\n\n\nThe fluid flow data in Fig. 9 show a sharp increase in injection flow rate at about 430\u00a0s, which is about 10\u00a0s after the injection pressure was increased to the peak pressure of just above 6\u00a0MPa. At this point in time, a sharp increase in fluid pressure can be observed at the monitoring point in borehole BSF4, located about 1.5\u00a0m horizontally from the injection point. Thereafter, as the injection pressure is reduced below about 4\u00a0MPa, an abrupt decrease in injection flow rate is noted at 453\u00a0s. The anchor displacements in Fig. 9 indicate that fracture deformation occurs already during the first few injection pressure steps, with displacements correlated to injection pressure steps. This may be interpreted as opening of the small fracture around the injection borehole that had been previously created during the initial hand pump injection. The displacements shown in Fig. 9 indicate opening of a steeply dipping discontinuity with a strike and dip similar to those shown in Fig. 8. However, these anchor measurements can be a result of complex discontinuity opening and shear that can be analyzed in more detail with coupled hydromechanical numerical modeling.\n\n\n5.2\nModels and parameters\nThe teams applied similar models to those that had been developed and verified in the previous benchmark tests. Also, most teams assumed a similar geometry, i.e., activation of a discontinuity dipping 65\u00b0 and with the strike being approximately parallel to the minimum principal stress direction. As seen in Fig. 8, this is consistent with the estimates of the in-situ stress field at Mont Terri.\n46\n This means that the potential for shear activation of the fault would depend on the shear stress as a result of the difference between the vertical and maximum horizontal stress magnitudes.\n\nFig. 10\n shows the mesh design for the six different models applied by various teams for the Step 2 modeling. CNSC's COMSOL and LBNL's TOUGH-FLAC models are half symmetric, which is possible considering the orientation of the fault relative to the stress field, with the minimum compressive stress oriented along the strike of the fault. Other models, including KIGAM's TOUGH-FLAC model, ENSI's OGS model, as well as LBNL's and INER's 3DEC models include the entire 20\u00a0m cube and can therefore be exposed to a stress field that is not exactly orthogonal to the strike of the fault.\nAll teams, except CNSC, considered a fault hydromechanical model based on FM1. That is, rupture propagation along an initially impermeable weakness plane formed by the discontinuity. As soon as rupture occurs, a fracture creation aperture is added, which results in a substantial increase in the local fracture permeability. The CNSC team used a model that is more similar to FM2, but with the addition of a \u201cdamage enhancement permeability factor\u201d associated with plastic strain. This damage enhancement factor correlates with failure and thus may have a similar effect on local fracture permeability as the fracture creation aperture model adopted by other teams.\n\nTable 3\n summarizes key parameters of all the six models. As learned from modeling of the previous benchmark experiments, the key for predicting the timing of the rupture is to accurately calibrate the parameters to induce shear failure or tensile failure and rupture propagation at 420\u00a0s. All teams applied a friction angle of 22\u00b0, which was a parameter given to the teams in the earlier benchmark calculation and this value is based on laboratory testing on Opalinus Clay within the Mont Terri project.\n54\n\n,\n\n55\n A number of teams also followed the benchmark calculation by assuming a cohesionless fault, i.e., cohesion was set to 0. Note that this would also imply a tensile strength equal to 0. Considering such strength properties, teams then varied the stress magnitudes and orientations to calibrate for rupture initiation and thereby attempted to achieve the best possible match with observed data.\n\n\n5.3\nModeling results with comparison to field data\n\nFig. 11\n presents comparison of the field data with the simulation results obtained with the six models that were applied to the Step 2 fault activation experiment. A good agreement with field data is obtained by all the modeling teams regarding the timing of the abrupt flow rate increase at 430\u00a0s and the subsequent flow rate decrease at 453\u00a0s (Fig. 11a). A similarly good agreement is achieved for the timing of the pressure response at the monitoring well (Fig. 11b), as well as the trends of the borehole anchor displacements (Fig. 11c). Some systematic difference can be observed between the teams that used the FM1 approach with rupture propagation along an impermeable weakness plane compared to CNSC who was using the FM2 approach with reopening of an initially slightly permeable discontinuity. The CNSC modeling shows a smoother pressure response at the monitoring borehole with a final pressure at the end (800\u00a0s) that is closer to the field measurements.\nThe total injection flow volume and the evolution of the injection rate is captured very well by most teams (Fig. 11a). The key parameters for matching the measured peak flow rate are the creation aperture (or damage enhancement factor) and fracture normal stiffness. These parameters determine how much permeability and flow rate can increase as a result of rupture and subsequent changes in effective normal stress as fluid pressure propagates into the created fracture. CNSC who uses an FM2 model, substantially underestimates the peak flow rate and total injection volume. Further sensitivity studies would be required to determine the exact reason for the lower injection rate achieved by CNSC, though it could be a matter of the choice of damage-permeability factor. Finally, there is an apparent disagreement between model results and experiments related to flow back. As observed in Fig. 11a, the modeling resulted in a significant flow-back volume seen as a negative flow rate after 453\u00a0s. In the experiments, fluid was released by opening a valve and letting the fluid flow back to reduce the injection borehole pressure, but the rate of flow back was not measured. Thus, we have no means of comparing modeled and experimental flow-back volumes.\nGood agreement is achieved regarding the relative anchor displacements, especially for the north and west relative displacements (Fig. 11c). The north and west displacements are each at an angle approximately +45\u00b0 and \u221245\u00b0 off the discontinuity dip direction, but are approximately equal in magnitude. This fact, together with the somewhat smaller magnitude of the vertical relative anchor displacements, indicates a fracture opening rather than shear as the dominant mechanism. The key parameters to match the measured anchor displacements are normal stiffness, shear stress, shear strength, and the dip of the discontinuity. The normal displacement determines the fracture opening that occurs at each pressure step during the initial 420\u00a0s of the injection. Thereafter, around 420\u00a0s, the rupture occurs, which induces some additional displacements and this is followed by a rebound when the injection pressure is reduced.\nWhile the modeling results are in very good agreement with the two horizontal displacements (northern and western), the vertical displacement is generally overestimated. The teams that are closest to match the vertical displacement are INER and ENSI who are using a fault dip of 82\u00b0 or 80\u00b0, respectively, rather than 60\u201370\u00b0 used by other teams. In fact, the initial elastic opening was used by INER to determine the exact orientation of the opening discontinuity. The INER team noted a slightly larger initial elastic displacement in the northern compared to the western direction and therefore set the dip direction of the discontinuity to N145 rather than N135 that was used by most other teams. However, the steep fault dip of 80 or 82\u00b0 is steeper than any detected discontinuity on the borehole wall.\nAfter reaching the peak injection pressure of 6\u00a0MPa, most teams calculated a shear failure with a relatively small shear displacement (Fig. 11d). For most teams, such shear displacement impacted the vertical displacement, leading to a rebound that is most obvious in the results for ENSI, who obtained the largest dip-slip shear displacement. Several modeling teams found that a large shear slip upon shear failure needs to be prevented in order to match the observed anchor displacements. This was achieved by some of the teams by either keeping the shear stress on the fault relatively small (i.e., limiting the difference between \u03c3V and \u03c3H), or by considering an increased cohesion. INER and LBNL-3DEC used a horizontal principal stress field not exactly parallel and normal to the strike of the discontinuity to capture an observed dominant (though small) strike-slip shear displacement.\n\n\n\n6\nStep 3 \u2013 modeling fault activation experiment at the fault core\nFor the Step 3 fault activation experiment, we first present the field experiment and data with general observations and interpretations, followed by the models, their parametrization, and results for the two modeling teams who completed the Step 3 fault activation modeling.\n\n6.1\nField test data\nThe Step 3 fault activation experiment was conducted by injecting into another interval of BFS2 closer to the core of the Main Fault (Figs. 2 and 12\n). During this injection experiment, fluid pressure and deformation were monitored at the injection borehole BFS2 and at the monitoring borehole BFS1 (about 3.5\u00a0m away in horizontal direction), at an interval which straddles the upper boundary of the fault core. The Step 3 fault activation experiment is more complex than Step 2, involving opening and shear deformations first along a discontinuity in the damage zone of the Main Fault which then connects with a prominent discontinuity along the interface between the fault core and the adjacent fault damage zone.\n14\n\n\n\nFig. 12 presents a detailed view of the injection interval, which is located in the fractured damage zone, about 3.4\u00a0m above the fault core interface. As determined by a borehole optical log, the injection chamber is intersected by 13 subparallel fault planes with a strike of N40-50\u00a0E and a dip of 35-55SE (Fig. 12c). As noted in Guglielmi et al.,\n13\n the displacement sensor is anchored across a 2-to-3-cm-thick minor fault that is striking N42E with a dip of 36SE. In the monitoring hole, the displacement sensor is centered at 35.9\u00a0m depth (measured from the overlying tunnel) across the upper boundary of the fault core, which is locally oriented N50\u00b0E and dipping 61\u00b0SE (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 13\n shows experimental data of injection flow rate and pressure at BFS2, as well as pressure and displacements at BFS1. An abrupt increase in flow rate occurs in the injection chamber of BFS2 once the pressure increases to between 5.4 and 5.7\u00a0MPa. A hydraulic connection establishes quickly between the injection (BFS2) and the monitoring chamber (BFS1), about 21\u00a0s after the rupture occurs at the injection hole. At this instance, a pressure increase of up to 4.2\u00a0MPa is observed in the monitoring borehole at the fault core, about 3\u00a0m away from the injection hole.\n\nFig. 13C shows a temporal close up of the pressure evolution, as well as the shear and normal displacements evaluated from the borehole deformation tool in the monitoring chamber BFS1. Included is also the occurrence of a swarm of small micro-seismic events. A millimeter sized shear displacement is triggered, which is partly aseismic since seismic events were only recorded after the main shear. These displacements are about 2.4 times larger than in the injection fault segment, corresponding to a normal fault activation. In detail, hydromechanical coupling effects are very complex, potentially occurring on several different fault planes affecting the BFS1 interval. For example, a large pressure drop is observed at the onset of the main shear displacement in BFS1, but not in BFS2, indicating a hydraulic de-connection between the injection and the monitoring points. Following this pressure drop, an apparent closing of the fault while shearing is observed.\n\n\n6.2\nModels and parameters\nIt was found early on that a successful simulation of the Step 3 fault activation experiment requires to include at least two intersecting discontinuities: one representing the fracture or minor fault connecting the injection well to the fault core, and another discontinuity representing the interface between the fault core and the surrounding damage zone. Four modeling teams, LBNL, ENSI, CNCS and DynaFrax attempted to model this experiment and provided some results for comparison.\n17\n The LBNL, ENSI and CNSC applied the same conceptual relationships for hydromechanical coupling as used and validated against the Step 2 experiment, whereas DynaFrax applied a newly developed three-dimensional fault hydromechanical model using the PFC3D code. Here we present comparison for two teams, LBNL and ENSI, that managed to model and provide a complete set of results for comparison of hydraulic and mechanical responses at both the injection and monitoring wells.\n\nFig. 14\n shows the models of LBNL-3DEC and ENSI, containing the two main discontinuities, with an additional discontinuity added in the LBNL-3DEC model. This additional discontinuity belongs to a discontinuity set observed mainly in the fault zone while not common in the injection interval. The discontinuity intersecting the injection interval in BFS2 is described in Guglielmi et al.\n15\n as a minor fault consisting of a discontinuity plane and a centimeter thick layer of shaly scale (Fig. 12). This minor fault intersects BFS2 with a dip of 36\u00b0 to the SE at a strike of N42E, which is approximately parallel to the minimum compressive horizontal stress (\u03c3h). In both LBNL-3DEC and ENSI models, this discontinuity is assumed to strike parallel to \u03c3h, while the dip is set to 37\u00b0 in the LBNL-3DEC model and 30\u00b0 in the ENSI model. The discontinuity at the boundary of the fault core has a dip of 60\u00b0 to the SE in both the LBNL-3DEC and ENSI models. However, the strike has been somewhat simplified in the ENSI model to be exactly parallel with the minor fault in BFS2 and hence parallel to \u03c3h.\n\nTable 4\n lists the key parameters used by the ENSI and LBNL teams to model Step 3. Both LBNL and ENSI used an approach based on the FM1 concept, similar to what these teams applied in the Step 2 experiment. The Step 2 parameters were used as a starting point, but then fine-tuned to match the Step 3 experimental data in terms of timing and magnitudes of flow rate, pressure and borehole deformations. The final set of parameters are very consistent between the two teams (Table 4). These include an equivalent stress field, with exactly the same values of \u03c3V\u00a0=\u00a05.5\u00a0MPa and \u03c3H\u00a0=\u00a04.7\u00a0MPa, as well as the same friction angle and creation aperture, whereas there are some small differences regarding fracture normal stiffness and cohesion. The cohesion is higher in the case of ENSI (0.85 vs 0.5\u00a0MPa), which may be a result of a different dip of the minor injection fault (30 vs 37\u00b0). The main difference is the model architecture with the additional discontinuity in the LBNL model, which also very much favorably oriented for slip.\n\n\n6.3\nModeling results with comparison to field data\n\nFig. 15\n presents selected results from the ENSI and LBNL-3DEC simulations with comparison to the field measurements. The simulation for LBNL-3DEC was stopped after about 900\u00a0s as the fluid pressure had propagated toward the outer boundary and was thereafter impacted by boundary effects.\n15\n The simulation results are in reasonable agreement with measured data, in particular the timing of the sudden increases and decreases of the flow rate, which occur after 800 and 1050\u00a0s, respectively. The simulated evolution of pore pressure in the BFS1 monitoring chamber also agrees well with the measurements with respect to timing and pressure magnitude. The simulations show that a high permeability connection has formed along the two connected discontinuities and is held open at a pressure of about 4\u00a0MPa. Water is injected at a high rate until the injection is shutdown at about 1050\u00a0s when the injection pressure is reduced below 4\u00a0MPa. Whereas both LBNL and ENSI accurately capture the timing of the injection rate, ENSI's modeling results show only about one third of the measured injection rate. In contrast, LBNL's results agree well with the observed injection rate.\nFor Step 3, the field data include relative anchor displacements at both the injection and monitoring boreholes, via two SIMFIP probes installed at these locations. Here we compare simulation results with the relative anchor displacements at the monitoring point in BFS1, at the fault core boundary (Fig. 15c). LBNL's results display larger magnitudes than ENSI results although both models reproduce well the orientation of the displacements. At 800\u00a0s, LBNL displacements show a sharp displacement variation followed by a partial more progressive reverse effect. This is in good agreement with what is observed in the measurements at 820\u00a0s (the model rupturing 20\u00a0s before what is observed in the field). This is not reproduced in the ENSI model results for the reason that it corresponds to the activation of the additional discontinuity which is only included in the LBNL model.\n\nFig. 15d shows the displacements in Fig. 12c re-plotted but here in terms of shear and normal displacement on the main N50\u00b0E and dipping 61\u00b0SE fault plane. A larger shear slip of ~300\u00a0\u03bcm is observed in the LBNL data, compared to the ENSI results. Nevertheless, this calculated slip still underestimates the in situ one which is about 850 \u03bcm (Fig. 13). The LBNL model reproduces reasonably well the complex opening \u2013 closing observed in the field. As mentioned before, this event is explained by the additional plane considered in the LBNL model. Comparison between these two models thus highlights the strong effect of the fault zone structural complexity on the local displacement measurements. Both models reasonably well reproduce the activation of the fault as a normal fault. The LBNL model which considers an additional local complexity much better reproduces both the magnitudes of displacements and the injected flowrate showing the strong effect of a local complexity on fault leakage. This is also the reason why the LBNL model is stopped earlier that the ENSI's one. A leakage flow path preferentially formed along that structure that fast reached the boundaries of the model. Main reason for that is that this structure although secondary is favorable oriented for shear than the main fault.\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\nIn the following we discuss the overall model comparison and parameters (Section 7.1), the relevance of the findings to the performance assessment of a nuclear waste repository (Section 7.2), and finally we discuss more advanced fault friction models that were not applied in this model comparison study (Section 7.3).\n\n7.1\nOverall model comparison and key parameters\nThe different numerical simulators and fault hydromechanical models applied in this study were all able to model the hydromechanical behavior observed in the field with reasonable accuracy. These include hydromechanical models that are fully coupled or sequentially coupled, and models with fault behavior represented by either an interface or by finite thickness solid elements. The hydromechanical behavior of the fault was represented best when modeling a propagating rupture along an existing weakness plane (that has very low initial permeability) which causes sudden permeability increases, simulated by an aperture opening or damage enhancing factor. Such models capture the observed behavior of abrupt flow increase when pressure increases over the pressure required to propagate the rupture, and the subsequent flow decrease once the injection pressure is lowered below a threshold pressure to hydraulically close the fracture.\nThe model parameters applied by the various teams are realistic; in many cases these are based on and agree reasonably well with the best estimates of properties of Opalinus Clay from the site investigations at the Mont Terri laboratory.\n54\n\n,\n\n55\n As mentioned, the timing of the rupture for both Step 2 and Step 3 experiments was captured by balancing the applied shear strength and shear stress on the fault. While all teams used the same values of friction angle there were some differences in the cohesion and applied shear stress. The applied shear stress is determined by the dip of the modeled discontinuities and by the values \u03c3V and \u03c3H, which vary significantly for the different models. This indicates a degree of non-uniqueness of the calibrated parameters.\nIt is relevant to compare the stress input applied by the different teams with estimates of the Mont Terri stress field, such as given in the comprehensive analysis of Corkum and Martin\n54\n, who reviewed previous stress measurements and suggested \u03c3V\u00a0=\u00a06\u20137\u00a0MPa and \u03c3H\u00a0=\u00a04\u20135\u00a0MPa, leading to a differential stress (\u03c3V - \u03c3H) averaging 2\u00a0MPa. While ENSI and LBNL-TOUGH applied a stress field within this range with a differential stress of 1.8\u00a0MPa for modeling the Step 2 experiment (Table 3), other teams applied a stress field with much less difference, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0\u00a0MPa. A low stress difference was necessary in some cases to prevent too early shear failure and too large shear slip magnitude. ENSI and LBNL-TOUGH could appy \u03c3V and \u03c3H within the range of estimates of Corkum and Martin\n46\n by impeding shear through a higher cohesion value.\nFinally, for the Step 3 models, both ENSI and LBNL-3DEC applied a stress field of \u03c3V\u00a0=\u00a05.5\u00a0MPa and \u03c3H\u00a0=\u00a04.2\u00a0MPa, therefore with a vertical stress below the 6\u20137\u00a0MPa range estimated from previous studies. In fact, Guglielmi et al.\n13\n performed a detailed analysis of the displacement responses at the injection borehole to back-calculate the stress field, which indicated that the smaller value of 5.5\u00a0MPa is a better estimate for the test location. It is possible that this could reflect a stress disturbance around the Mont Terri Main Fault, leading to slightly different stress compared to the general stress field at Mont Terri. Note that the Step 3 experiment was conducted well within the damage zone of the fault, and close to a section where the fault core bends, meaning that the maximum principal stress may not be exactly vertical as has been assumed in the current models of DECOVALEX-2019 Task B. Models in step 3 also highlighted the importance to choose the model complexity that best represents the fault zone in order to get a relevant estimation of both fault displacement and flow rate.\n\n\n7.2\nRelevance to repository performance\nIn the performance assessment of a repository, the evolution of the isolation barriers should be estimated.\n60\n In this case we have to estimate the evolution of the host rock barrier function. As illustrated in Fig. 1, thermo-poroelastic stress changes may lead to hydraulic fracturing or shear activation of faults and fractures that may impact the host rock barrier function. These processes have to be considered in the thermal management and repository design.\n61\n\n\nWe found that certain input parameters impact different processes and events during the Mont Terri fault activation experiments. In Table 5\n we relate these key parameters and events to the repository performance associated with the sealing capacity of the host rock barrier. We found that the timing of the shear activation was determined by the balance between the shear stress acting on the fault and its shear strength. The key parameters for the balance between shear stress and strength include the three dimensional in situ stress field, the orientation of the fault or fractures relative to the principal stresses, and the shear strength of the fault (cohesion and friction angle). On top of this, the thermo-poroelastic stress changes and their impact on fault shear stress and shear strength will have to be estimated.\nAccurate determination of the initial three-dimensional stress field will be critical for predicting when a fault could be reactivated or when more wide spread activation of fractures could occur. As experienced from the Mont Terri site, stress determination in claystone is difficult and there could be significant uncertainty in the estimate of the three-dimensional stress field, especially related to the magnitudes of the principal stresses.\n58\n Model parameters such as friction angle and cohesion can be estimated based on laboratory tests on rock cores from the site such as have been done at the Mont Terri Laboratory.\n55\n Finally, if fractures and faults are activated, the potential changes in permeability depends of whether the fractures dilate and open during shear, or if they rather compact without any significant permeability increase. The modeling of the field tests in this study showed that most significant permeability change occurred when fluid pressure approached and exceeded the estimated initial stress normal to the opened fractures. However, as soon as the pressure was reduced to about 1\u20132\u00a0MPa less than the estimated normal stress, injection rate declined to close to zero indicating hydraulic closure. The fact that the activated discontinuity closes as soon as the pressure decreases provides an important and beneficial feature for nuclear waste disposal in argillaceous clays, i.e., demonstrating a self-sealing mechanism which keeps the host rock barrier tight and limits the longevity of transport pathways.\nThis study demonstrates how these types of in situ experiments can be used to evaluate potential permeability changes and the self-sealing performance. The tests can provide for an in situ determination of fracture and fault properties not impacted by sample disturbance. Moreover, these in situ characterization tests can also be used to better constrain the three-dimensional stress field.\n15\n\n,\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n7.3\nConsideration of advanced fault friction models\nThe modeling performed in this study could reproduce the overall hydromechanical responses observed from the experiments using basic constitutive models, such as the Coulomb criterion, a linear normal stiffness, and the cubic law for fracture flow. The models were sufficient to model observed elastic opening and shear activation of the fault, the abrupt changes in injection rate, as well as hydraulic closure when the injection pressure was reduced. However, a more detailed examination of the different stages of the field data reveals more complex behavior. For example, Park et al.\n22\n examined the benchmark cases under slightly different stress conditions and found an initial stable shear slip event prior to the main shear slip. Moreover, Guglielmi et al.\n14\n examined in detail the transient fault displacement evolution of the Step 3 experiment and identified a small slow slip event. Such slow slip events have been observed in the past at similar field experiments.\n56\n The phenomena of stable to unstable slip have been quite extensively studied and modeled with slip weakening models,\n19\n\n,\n\n41\n\n,\n\n62\n\n,\n\n63\n or with rate-and-state friction models.\n33\n\n,\n\n64\n\n,\n\n65\n This is related to an aseismic to seismic slip transition in which rupture extent and the stress transfer from asseismic slip at the center can drive the seismic front at the edges of the rupture zone.\n63\n\n,\n\n66\n A rate frictional law combined with a rate-and-state permeability law have also been applied for reproducing some of the complex behavior at the Mont Terri fault activation experiments.\n67\n This is an active research area which to a large part has been triggered by the need for a better understanding of induced seismicity mechanisms associated with underground injection activities. One questions is whether such complex fault constitutive models are necessary for the performance assessment related to nuclear waste repository; simplified models for bounding estimates of possible changes to the sealing barriers may be sufficient. However, subtle aseismic changes in permeability as have been observed in some of the Mont Terri experiments may be relevant and should be assessed over the long-term repository performance period.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nOverall, this DECOVALEX-2019 task has (1) resulted in important model developments and adaptations of numerical simulators to simulate fault activation and (2) provided an increased understanding of the hydromechanical behavior of minor faults and fractures in low-permeability shale formations. Two different injection experiments which activated discontinuities within the Mont Terri Main Fault, including parts of the damage zone and close to the fault core, were successfully modeled by a variety of research teams. The key for accurately representing these two activation experiments is a hydromechanical fault model that captures the abrupt activation behavior. The first characteristic of this activation behavior is a sudden increase in fracture permeability and flow rate along with a rupture propagation that is triggered at a certain injection pressure magnitude higher than the estimated stress normal to the discontinuity. The second characteristic is a sudden hydraulic closure of the discontinuity that occurs when the injection fluid pressure is reduced to about 1\u20132\u00a0MPa less than the stress normal to the fault. This behavior was modeled by permeability enhancement resulting from damage induced plastic failure and a subsequent permeability reduction as a result of elastic fracture closure. The fact that the activated discontinuity closes as soon as the pressure decreases provides an important and beneficial feature for nuclear waste disposal in argillaceous clays, i.e., demonstrating a self-sealing mechanism which keeps the host rock barrier tight and limits the longevity of transport pathways. The models developed and tested within this DECOVALEX task can now be applied to predict such behavior at a repository site in an argillaceous claystone, but the hydromechanical fault activation models would ideally be tested and validated by site specific experiments of the type conducted and analyzed in this task.\n\n","20":"","21":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe permeability of fractures and faults, or, more generally, shear fractures in crustal rocks has been a substantial research topic in the past. It is not only important in crustal faulting processes or earthquake mechanisms, but is also key in understanding the fluid flow in faulted or enhanced geothermal systems,\n1\u20134\n as well as the stability of underground constructions, such as tunnels or nuclear waste repositories. Fractures control the hydrological and mechanical behaviour of rock masses, such that any changes in fracture properties have a large impact on the bulk transport properties. Laboratory experiments with fractured rock samples are a substantial element to better understand and physically characterise fractures in order to imply physical relationships for the larger scale.\nConventional tri-axial compression tests are classically used to generate shear fractures or shear zones. Since measuring fracture permeability in such experiments is difficult and fracture permeability cannot be isolated from the rock matrix, other experimental approaches are required. The fractures used for experiments are commonly generated in tensile mode, for example by Brazilian Disk splitting,\n5\u20137\n or existing, as well as artificial joints are used.\n8\u201310\n The sample halves are then placed together at a certain offset and are installed in a tri-axial cell or shear-box tool to study the permeability evolution. Although the term shear fracture is often applied to such geometries, they do not represent the complex structure of a single shear or fault zone. Several attempts have been made in the past to reproduce a single realistic fault zone in the laboratory. Watanabe et al.\n11\n used a shear-box tool to apply mode II loading to an intact rock sample, but pointed out that it is difficult to generate a single shear fracture from shear-box experiments due to the occurrence of multiple fractures. However, experiments by Frash et al.\n12\n using shale and anhydrite samples highlighted the importance of features, such as en echelon structures, for the aperture anisotropy. Recently, Ye & Ghassemi\n13\n used a conventional tri-axial setup with cylindrical double-flawed samples connected to pumps using two injection holes. By increasing the injection pressure, they generated a complex fracture network including shear and tensile fractures and compared the permeability before and after fracture generation.\nBesides the challenge to generate a single shear zone while flowing fluid through the sample, permeability is rarely measured during the initiation and propagation of a fracture under in-situ pressure conditions. First attempts to measure permeability while generating a shear fracture in high permeable rocks have been made for example by Zhu et al.\n14\n or Crawford.\n15\n De Paola et al.\n16\n measured the permeability of anhydrite samples during tri-axial testing and subdivided the permeability evolution into three stages of compaction, dilation and brittle failure. Others measured the permeability in tri-axial tests using the pore pressure oscillation method.\n17\u201319\n Mitchell and Faulkner\n20\n quantified the permeability enhancement to about 2 orders of magnitude with the same experimental procedure for granite and granodiorite. However, the shear fractures in these tests were not parallel to the flow direction or the entire sample integrity was lost during failure, which makes it difficult to isolate the mechanical and hydraulic behaviour of the fracture from the surrounding rock mass. Watanabe et al.\n11\n fractured granite samples in a shear-box tool and measured the permeability of these samples in another flow-through apparatus. Although a flow parallel fracture geometry is given, no fluid flow was applied during fracturing and the sample had to be removed from the shear apparatus after fracture generation, which highly alters the hydraulic-mechanical fracture properties.\nThe permeability during shearing is substantial for the understanding of the processes involved in hydro-shearing or the permeability evolution in active faults. In some experimental studies, asymmetric loading conditions on a pre-existing tensile fracture in cylindrical samples with different end cap designs were used to displace a fracture while measuring permeability.\n17\n\n,\n\n21\n\n,\n\n22\n Shear-box tools were also used to displace a fracture under normal loading conditions,\n23\n\n,\n\n24\n but the normal effective pressures in these tests were too low to make meaningful conclusions or additional fractures formed. Watanabe et al.\n11\n compared the permeability of displaced tensile fractures and fractures generated by shearing and found that displaced tensile fractures have a higher permeability and a higher resistance to closing compared to shear fractures when increasing normal stress. More frequently, tri-axial set ups with injection-holes are used to generate a shear displacement on a pre-existing planar shear plane in different materials.\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n Other authors performed performed stick-slip experiments with artificial surfaces,\n27\n\n,\n\n28\n which are sheared while measuring permeability. Although it is possible to accurately quantify permeability, the experimental set ups mentioned involve unrealistic planar fracture surfaces, which lead to only marginal permeability changes or are performed at very low normal stress.\nThe longevity or sustainability of the generated permeability enhancement by fracturing is crucial for engineering applications, in which, for example, pore pressures change due to production and injection schemes, or the fracture aperture changes due to stress relaxation when the well is not operated. In experimental studies with granite\n5\n\n,\n\n11\n\n,\n\n29\n\n,\n\n30\n the effective pressure was varied by changing the confining pressure cyclically using displaced tensile fractures in granite and found a progressive reduction in permeability with each cycle. However, manually displaced tensile fractures might have a different initial strength during the first loading stages compared to faults. Furthermore, a variation in confining pressure is different compared to changing the pore pressure when considering effective pressure coefficients.\n31\n Zangerl et al.\n32\n evaluated the fracture normal stiffness of several granite samples and provided a range of values, without finding systematic changes, but highlighted the importance of surface geometry and asperity deformability. Lastly, permeability losses are often observed in experiments and are related to mechanical compaction\n17\n\n,\n\n27\n or fluid-rock interactions.\n33\n Therefore, effective pressure cycling, fracture stiffness characterisation, as well as compaction induced permeability reductions need to be considered for complex shear fracture or fault geometries. There is too little quantification of permeability enhancement in granite during shear fracture generation or permeability evolution during shearing and only a few of those studies account for a realistic shear zone geometry, or they are limited in terms of the displacement magnitude.\nWe present an approach to combine most of the above-mentioned experimental technologies in a single experiment. The evolution of permeability during initiation and propagation of a circular shear fracture (referred to as a microfault in the following) is presented, using the Punch-Through-Shear (PTS) test, originally developed to measure mode II fracture toughness.\n34\u201338\n The existing experimental setup has been supplemented with the possibility of saturating the sample and allowing fluid flow-through to measure the pressure gradient across the sample. This enables us to determine the permeability of an artificially-generated microfault with flow oriented parallel to the fracture. The PTS test allows for the quantification of the permeability during fracture initiation, propagation and effective pressure changes, an analysis of fracture properties and geometry, as well as an assessment of its hydraulic-mechanical sustainability.\n\n\n2\nMaterials & methods\n\n2.1\nTesting equipment\nThe Punch-Through-Shear (PTS) test was carried out in a conventional MTS tri-axial compression cell. The stiff, servo-controlled loading frame (MTS 815, Material Testing Systems Corporation) holds a loading capacity of up to 4600\u00a0kN (load cell calibrated to 1000\u00a0kN, calibration error\u00a0<\u00a01%) and a servo-controlled maximum hydrostatic confining pressure of 140\u00a0MPa applied via an oil-filled pressure vessel coupled to an external pressure intensifier. The pore fluid pressure was applied via four Quizix fluid pressure pumps (Model C6000-10K-HC-AT) with a maximum fluid pressure of 70\u00a0MPa. Flow-through was continuously applied at a minimum of 2\u00a0MPa confining pressure using two paired upstream pumps and two paired downstream pumps. The differential fluid pressure, which is the difference between in- and outflow pressure, was measured using a differential pressure sensor (Honeywell HL-Z; range: 1\u00a0MPa; line pressure max. 35\u00a0MPa; precision: ~1%). Changes in circumferential strain were measured using a LVDT extensometer chain. All experiments have been performed at ambient conditions, i.e. temperatures of 25\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C. Data were recorded at a frequency of 1\u00a0Hz. A detailed description of the machine is found in Pei et al.\n39\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nSample material\nThe testing material is a granite from the Odenwald region (International Geo Sample Number (IGSN): GFTRE0033) taken from a quarry in Rimbach, Germany. The fresh granite shows no signs of strong alterations or microfracturing (Fig. 1\nc\u2013f). It is composed of quartz (Qtz) with a grain size ranging from 1 to 3\u00a0mm, feldspar (Fsp) between 2 to 3\u00a0mm and mica (Mca) between 1 to 3\u00a0mm, suggesting a very even size distribution of minerals. Quartz, as well as the darker and brighter mica are the main constituents, feldspars have a less frequent occurrence. Microfractures are only partially present and either cut through grains, or propagate along grain boundaries with no visible shear offset. The porosity of less than 0.6% is mostly intra-granular and rarely connected. The intact rock properties of the Odenwald granite, in the following labelled as PGR6-RI,\n40\n are summarized in Table 1\n. Three granite samples have been tested with their testing conditions and sample dimensions listed in Table 2\n.\n\n\n2.3\nSample geometry & experimental setup\nThe idea of the Punch-Through-Shear (PTS) test is to have a notched intact cylindrical sample, of which a smaller inner part (inner cylinder) is punched through the surrounding hollow cylinder. The main objective is to generate a shear stress concentration at the notch tips generating a circular shear fracture (microfault) connecting the bottom and top notch of a cylindrical rock sample. The experimental set up and sample geometry are illustrated in Fig. 1a and b.\nThe set up consists of a piston assembly that applies a load to the top inner cylinder and the bottom outer annulus of the sample, as well as a core-holder system supporting the sample at the bottom, both made of stainless steel. The cylindrical samples were drilled from larger blocks to a diameter, \nd\n, of 50\u00a0mm using a diamond drill bit and water as lubricant. The samples were cut to length, \nL\n, of 50\u00a0mm using a diamond saw, and the end-surfaces were ground plan-parallel. The notches were then drilled using a diamond drill bit with an inner diameter, \n\n\nr\n\nI\nD\n\n\n\n, of 25\u00a0mm and a wall thickness, i.e. notch width, \n\n\nW\nN\n\n\n, of 1\u00a0mm. Top notch depth and lower notch depth were 5 and 15\u00a0mm respectively, resulting in an intact portion, \n\n\nL\n\nI\nP\n\n\n\n, of 30\u00a0mm. This intact portion, \n\n\nL\n\nI\nP\n\n\n\n, was larger compared to the 15\u00a0mm suggested by the ISRM International Society for Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering,\n35\n but was used to enable the proper characterisation of the hydraulic, mechanical and geometrical properties of the microfault. This deviation from the recommended design is acceptable, as no variations in fracture toughness up to a length of 35\u00a0mm were previously found.\n35\n\n,\n\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n The mechanical integrity of the top-notch walls was supported by a 0.3\u00a0mm strong steel ring (2\u00a0mm shorter than the top notch length \n\n\nL\n\nU\nN\n\n\n\n) to prevent breakouts and compaction that were observed in pre-tests without a supporting ring (Fig. 1d). Due to its shorter length the ring is assumed to not cause axial stress to the rock sample itself. The sample was covered with a heat-shrink tube to prevent confining fluid from entering the sample.\nThe loading assembly, shown in Fig. 1a, consists of a mobile steel cylinder of 25\u00a0mm in diameter (I), guided by a surrounding hollow cylinder (II), which is 2\u00a0mm shorter than the mobile inner cylinder. The space in between the two parts is sealed by O-rings to prevent oil from entering the sample. The lower part of the assembly consists of a rigid core-holder system with a hollow cylindrical shape to counteract the applied load from the top (III). A movable smaller core-holder in the middle (IV), also sealed with O-rings, is mounted on a set of springs in an air-filled chamber. This is to prevent the inner cylinder from falling down instantly after failure and allows for a controlled displacement along the fracture. Fluid ports were incorporated within the loading assembly and core-holder system, sealed from the confining fluid by O-rings. A grid across the surface of the end caps allows for uniform in- and outflow across the entire cross-sectional area (top and bottom) of the sample. An extensometer chain (LVDT) attached at the centre between upper and lower notch is used to record the bulk circumferential strain throughout the entire duration of the test. Furthermore, the integrity of the sample wall during one experiment was monitored (PGR6-RI-01-07). Silver paste was applied to the circumference of the sample connected to an electronic circuit, such that any fracturing of the wall would result in an interruption of the electric signal (Fig. 1d).\n\n\n2.4\nExperimental procedures\nThe sample was installed in the measuring assembly and an absolute pore pressure of 10\u00a0mbar was generated using a vacuum pump (Laboxact SEM 820). The confining pressure was increased from 0 to 2\u00a0MPa\u00a0at a rate of 0.5\u00a0MPa\/min with the dry sample. After applying the vacuum, the system was saturated by applying a constant fluid pressure of 0.2\u00a0MPa from the upstream side. That way, water flew into the sample under nearly vacuum conditions, such that all pores were saturated. Saturation was finished when no more water flew into the sample to avoid effects of the saturation process to govern the permeability at later stages of the experiments.\n5\n For all permeability measurements, a constant flow rate (0.4\u20131\u00a0ml\/min) was applied to the bottom of the sample and a constant pressure was applied at the downstream side (10\u201330\u00a0MPa) to determine the sample permeability. Steady-state conditions were reached when the flow rates and pressure difference reach a constant value. Sample permeability, \nk\n, was calculated by equation (1) using Darcy's law,\n41\n where the length, \n\n\nL\n\nI\nP\n\n\n\n, is the distance between the lower and upper notch which corresponds to the maximum pressure gradient in the microfault. The sample permeability, k, corresponds to the permeability of the rock portion between the notches, assuming there is no pressure gradient along the 1\u00a0mm wide notches:\n\n(1)\n\n\nk\n=\n\n(\n\nQ\n\/\nA\n\n)\n\n\u2217\n\n(\n\u03bc\n\n\nL\n\nI\nP\n\n\n)\n\n\/\nd\nP\n\n\n\nwhere \nQ\n is the volumetric inflow rate in m\n3\n\/s, \nA\n is the cross-sectional area of the sample in m,\n2\n\n\n\u03bc\n is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa s), \n\n\nL\n\nI\nP\n\n\n\n is the distance between the notches of the sample in m and \n\nd\nP\n\n is the differential fluid pressure in Pa. The minimum measurable permeability of our apparatus is around k\u00a0=\u00a010\u221218\u00a0m.\n2\n It is important to note, that steady-state permeability, \n\n\nk\n\ns\ns\n\n\n\n, was measured during the hold phase (C), during shearing (D) and before pressure cycling (E), as well as during the constant pressure phases during cyclic loading (F). In contrast, flow conditions were transient, \n\n\nk\n\nt\nr\na\nn\ns\n\n\n\n, during the fracturing process (B) and during pore pressure ramping (F). These measurements were labelled as apparent permeability in the results, although they were calculated using equation (1). Comparing the minimum measurable permeability and the permeability after the hold phase, the fold of increase in permeability, \n\n\nk\n\nF\nO\nI\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nk\n\ns\ns\n\n\n\n\nh\no\nl\nd\n\n\n\/\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n18\n\n\n\n, was calculated to infer the permeability enhancement by fracturing.\nDuring the fracturing process, an elevated effective pressure state is desired, where Terzaghi's effective pressure,\n42\n\n\n\n\nP\n\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\n (equation (2.1)), is defined as the confining pressure, \n\n\nP\nc\n\n\n, minus fluid pressure,\n\n\n\nP\np\n\n\n. The pore fluid pressure was estimated by the outflow pressure, \n\n\nP\n\np\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n\n, and the differential fluid pressure, \n\n\nP\n\np\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\u2013\n\n\nP\n\np\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n\n, divided by two (equation (2.2)), assuming a linear pressure distribution\n5\n\n,\n\n6\n:\n\n(2.1)\n\n\n\nP\n\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n=\n\nP\nc\n\n\u2212\n\nP\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.2)\n\n\n\nP\np\n\n=\n\nP\n\np\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n+\n\n(\n\nP\n\np\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\nP\n\np\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n)\n\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe change of volume of fluid in the sample, \n\n\nV\nb\n\n\n (bulk volume) was determined according to equation (3) from the difference of cumulative inflow (\n\n\nV\n\ni\nn\n\n\n\n) and cumulative outflow volume (\n\n\nV\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n\n) in ml:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nV\nb\n\n=\n\nV\n\ni\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\nV\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter saturating the sample at 2\u00a0MPa confining pressure, the fluid pressure and confining pressure were simultaneously increased to 20\u00a0MPa and 40\u00a0MPa, respectively, within 1\u00a0h to an effective pressure of 20\u00a0MPa (Fig. 2\n, A). Afterwards, an axial displacement rate of 0.001\u00a0mm\/s was applied to the top of sample (Fig. 2, B), which pushed the inner loading cylinder down relative to the guiding hollow cylinder until the point of failure. A drop in axial load, \nF\n, indicated the formation of a fracture. Up to this point, the inflow and outflow pressure were kept constant at a differential fluid pressure of 0.5\u00a0MPa. The fracture geometry was intended to initiate from the outer lower notch tip to the inner upper notch tip,\n35\n resulting in an overall conical shape.\nThe mode II fracture toughness, \n\n\nK\n\nI\nI\nc\n\n\n\n, or critical stress intensity factor, is a material parameter obtained by the PTS test, and depends on the type of rock material and its physical boundary conditions, such as confining pressure and temperature.\n36\n\n,\n\n37\n The fracture toughness (\n\n\nK\n\nI\nI\nc\n\n\n\n) was calculated at the point of failure by the following empirical relation (equation (4)) based on the ISRM Suggested Methods\n35\n:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nK\n\nI\nI\nc\n\n\n=\n7.74\n\u2217\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n\nF\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\u2212\n1.80\n\u2217\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\nP\n\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\u2217\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nF\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n is the peak load in kN and \n\n\nP\n\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\n is the effective pressure in MPa. Using the circumferential extensometer, the mechanical fracture dilation (\n\n\ne\n\nm\ne\nc\nh\n\n\n\n) can be calculated by converting the change in circumference (\n\nd\nU\n\n) in mm to a change in radius:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\ne\n\nm\ne\nc\nh\n\n\n=\nd\nU\n\/\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fracture dilation is assumed to approximate the fracture aperture during the test. In addition, the changes in volume (equation (3)) were used to calculate the volume balance-based dilation \n\n\ne\n\nv\no\nl\n\n\n\n. This was only possible during phase B, since the change of cumulative fluid volume could be measured when a constant differential fluid pressure was applied. During fracture generation, additional void is generated. This is composed by the opening of the fracture itself, as well as the widening of the notches. The widening of the two notches is considered at the outer notch radius, \n\n\nr\n\nO\nN\n\n\n\n. The additional volume can then be approximated as follows:\n\n(6.1)\n\n\n\u0394\n\nV\n\nn\no\nt\nc\nh\n\n\n=\n\u0394\ne\n2\n\nr\n\nO\nN\n\n\n\u03c0\n\nL\nN\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nr\n\nO\nN\n\n\n\n is the radius to the outer notch, \n\n\nL\nN\n\n\n is the total length of the upper and lower notch and \ne\n is the dilation with all units in m. The fracture has a shape of a truncated cone with a mantle surface area of \n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\nO\nN\n\n\n+\n\nr\n\nI\nD\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u03c0\n\nL\n\nf\nr\na\nc\n\n\n\n. Here, \n\n\nL\n\nf\nr\na\nc\n\n\n\n is the fracture length measured from the lower outer and top inner notch, \n\n\nr\n\nI\nD\n\n\n\n is the inner radius and \n\n\nr\n\nO\nN\n\n\n\n the radius to the outer notch wall (Fig. 6c).

After that, the axial displacement was again increased at a slower rate of 0.0001\u00a0mm\/s leading to an increase in shear displacement until a maximum of around 1.2\u00a0mm was reached (Fig. 2, D). Finally, the axial displacement of the loading cylinder at the top was maintained to measure changes in stress and was kept in this position for at least 16\u00a0h (Fig. 2, E).\nAfter that, the effective pressure was varied cyclically by changing the mean fluid pressure in the sample by\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 or\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0MPa (Fig. 2, F). A constant ramp operation of fluid pressure (0.5\u00a0MPa\/min) was applied to the outflow side of the sample with the inflow pressure following the given ambient pressure change without active operation. Steady state flow conditions were achieved when the inflow and outflow pressure and rates reached a constant value, which took about 10\u00a0min considering a hydraulic diffusivity of about 4.5*10-6\u00a0m2\/s for a length of 0.05\u00a0m calculated according to Nicholas et al.\n43\n For the diffusivity we used a conservative matrix permeability of 1*10-19\u00a0m2, Biot and Skempton coefficients of 0.4 and 0.6 and a bulk compressibility of 30\u00a0GPa reported for granite.\n44\n During pressure cycling, the vertical load, \nF\n, was transformed into shear stress,\n35\n\n\n\u03c4\n using equation (7):\n\n(7)\n\n\n\u03c4\n=\nF\n\/\n\n(\n\u03c0\n\n\nr\n\nI\nD\n\n\n\n\nL\n\nf\nr\na\nc\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nr\n\nI\nD\n\n\n\n is the inner diameter in m and \n\n\nL\n\nf\nr\na\nc\n\n\n\n is the fracture length in m. This equation assumes and simplifies that the fracture to be a single plane. The fracture stiffness describes the fracture closure behaviour under increasing effective normal pressure. For a semi-logarithmic closure law\n45\n only one free parameter, the fracture stiffness characteristic, \n\u03c7\n, is required and was obtained from the slope of the effective normal pressure versus fracture aperture change\n32\n\n,\n\n46\n following equation (8):\n\n(8)\n\n\nln\n\n(\n\n\nP\n\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\u03c7\u00a0\u0394\n\ne\nmech\n\n+\nln\n\n(\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\nr\ne\nf\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\n is the normal effective pressure in MPa, \n\u03c7\n, the fracture stiffness characteristic in mm\u22121, \n\n\u0394\n\ne\n\nm\ne\nc\nh\n\n\n\n is the change in mechanical dilation in mm and \n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\nr\ne\nf\n\n\n\n is any arbitrary reference value of normal stress in MPa. After effective pressure cycling was finished, the testing conditions were kept constant for another 12\u00a0h, until the axial displacement, fluid and confining pressure were decreased simultaneously at similar rates as at the loading stage (Fig. 2, G).\n\n\n\n3\nExperimental results\nIn the following, the process of microfault generation and propagation is described and the results for permeability evolution, flow rate changes, fracture dilation and volume balance during loading are given (Figs. 3\u20135\n\n\n\n). The evolution of shear stress, dilation, permeability and fracture stiffness for cyclic effective pressure loading are also presented (Figs. 7\u20139\n\n\n). Furthermore, the fracture geometry is described using the computed x-ray CT imaging (Fig. 10\n). The overall results are summarized in Table 3\n.\n\n3.1\nFracture generation\nThe loading and failure process can be subdivided into five regimes with different dominant processes (Figs. 3\u20135). The stages of fracture initiation and propagation are illustrated in Fig. 6.\nDuring stiffening and compaction at the first stage of loading, the volume of the sample was reduced and water was squeezed out of the sample. Between 0.60 to 0.65\u00a0mm of axial displacement, the inflow rate started to increase, the load curve flattened and the volume balance reached an inflection point (Fig. 3a and b; 4a, b, c and 5a, b, c). At this point, fracture initiation took place from the bottom of the sample, indicated by an increased inflow rate and a misbalance between in- and outflow, leading to dilation and a consequent increase of fracture volume of the sample (Fig. 6). Using equations (5) and (6.3), the mechanical fracture dilation and the volume balance-based dilation was calculated, respectively, since it was assumed that a fracture is introduced into the sample. The mechanical dilation, which represents the change in mechanical aperture, increased faster than the volume-based dilation, since it took longer for the pore fluid to progress through the sample and the circumferential strain was only measured at the centre of the intact portion.\nAt the point of failure, the axial load reached values of about 212, 203 and 197\u00a0kN which is equal to 424, 406 and 394\u00a0MPa axial stress, which corresponds to 384, 366 and 354\u00a0MPa differential stress for sample PGR6-RI-01-07, PGR6-RI-01-08 and PGR6-RI-01-09, respectively. The load then dropped and the increase in outflow rate indicated a hydraulic short-cut between the lower and upper notch, suggesting a fully developed fracture system. Calculating the mean fracture propagation velocity, \n\n\nv\n\np\nr\no\np\n\n\n\n, which is simply the length of the fracture, \n\n\nL\n\nf\nr\na\nc\n\n\n\n, over the time span of fracture initiation to the point of failure, \n\n\nt\n\np\nr\no\np\n\n\n\n, the velocity was in the range of 0.1\u20130.3\u00a0mm\/s (\n\n\nv\n\np\nr\no\np\n\n\n=\n\nL\n\nf\nr\na\nc\n\n\n\/\n\nt\n\np\nr\no\np\n\n\n\n). After failure, at a displacement of about 0.7\u20130.8\u00a0mm, the inner cylinder was punched down and most of the aperture was created, indicated by a rapid increase in mechanical and volume-based dilation. The measured load was now controlled by the frictional properties of the fracture. Shortly after the point of failure the displacement was put on hold for about 30\u00a0min (hold phase) such that the fluid pressure field could reach steady state flow conditions. The final value for dilation and fracture volume were reached during the hold phase when fluid pressure diffusion was finished. After restarting the displacement up to a maximum of 1.2\u00a0mm all samples showed no drop or rapid increase in axial load, i.e. no \u201cstick slip\u201d behaviour, but rather approached a limiting value of about 75 and 100\u00a0kN. This behaviour of fracture generation and propagation was similar in all three experiments. The fracture toughness values (equation (4)) for the saturated granite samples ranged between 15.3 and 16.4\u00a0MPa*m0.5 (Table 3).\n\n\n3.2\nPermeability and dilation evolution during failure\nDuring all tests, the permeability was measured simultaneously during loading and failure. The flow conditions during failure were regarded as transient (apparent permeability, \n\n\nk\n\nt\nr\na\nn\ns\n\n\n\n), but steady state after the hold phase (steady-state permeability, \n\n\nk\n\ns\ns\n\n\n\n). The permeability evolution during fracture generation is shown in Figs. 3b, 4d and 5d, where all experiments showed a pre-failure increase in apparent permeability of half to almost one order of magnitude, coinciding roughly with the inflection point of the volume balance as well as with the onset of yielding. For all granite samples, the increase in permeability was about 2 to almost 3 orders of magnitude at an effective pressure of 20\u00a0MPa (Pc\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0MPa, Pp\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0MPa), comparing the pre-failure permeability and the permeability during the hold phase (\n\n\nk\n\nF\nO\nI\n\n\n\n, Table 3). As explained before, the main dilation and consequent permeability was generated after the point of failure, with values of 0.06\u20130.07\u00a0mm (PGR6-RI-01-08) and 0.07\u20130.08\u00a0mm (PGR6-RI-01-09), while mechanical dilation and volume-based dilation were in very good agreement, suggesting that the measured dilation corresponds to the mechanical aperture. After the hold phase, the microfault was displaced up to 1.2\u00a0mm, resulting in a gentle increase in mechanical dilation to about 0.1\u00a0mm for sample PGR6-RI-01-08 and 0.09\u00a0mm in sample PGR6-RI-01-09, while permeability was consequently relatively constant. The maximum additional increase was between a factor of 4.0 for sample PGR6-RI-01-07 and 1.1 for sample PGR6-RI-01-09. No additional fracturing was inferred from the mechanical-hydraulic and electrical data (PGR6-RI-01-07) during this period. Permeability decay curves measured for about 16\u00a0h were similar for two granite samples at 20\u00a0MPa effective pressure and showed a reduction by a factor of 2.5 to 4 (inset Figs. 4d and 5d).\n\n\n3.3\nPermeability evolution during pore pressure cycling\nTo simulate reservoir operation procedures, such as injection or production, the pore pressure was cycled in two samples in order to monitor possible changes in shear stress due to slipping of the fault, permeability and strain at varying effective pressure (Figs. 7 and 8). The starting pore pressure of 20\u00a0MPa was varied by\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0MPa (PGR6-RI-01-08) and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0MPa (PGR6-RI-01-09), corresponding to a change of around 500\u20131000\u00a0m in the water column in a geothermal well. In total, six cycles of pore pressure increase and decrease were performed for each experiment.\nThe permeability was reduced when the pore pressure was reduced (effective pressure increase), while the permeability increased for increasing pore pressure (effective pressure decrease). The total variations in permeability for the pressure changes of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0MPa (PGR6-RI-01-08, Fig. 7b) ranged from 8.53*10-17 m\u00b2 to 2.57*10-16 m\u00b2, while permeability varied from 3.84*10-16 m\u00b2 to 6.0*10-17 m\u00b2 for pressure variations of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0MPa (PGR6-RI-01-09, Fig. 8b). Permeability was slightly increased from 1.10*10-16\u00a0m2 to 1.58*10-16\u00a0m2 after six pressure cycles for the variations of 5\u00a0MPa (PGR6-RI-01-08). Similar, a minor permanent increase from 8.65*10-17\u00a0m2 to 1.17*10-16\u00a0m2 was observed for the effective pressure variations of 10\u00a0MPa (PGR6-RI-01-09). Comparing the mechanical dilation evolution (Figs. 7c and 8c), both samples showed a similar behaviour, which is opening during the pore pressure increase (effective pressure decrease) and closure during the pore pressure decrease (effective pressure increase). Doubling the pore pressure change led to a doubling in magnitude of the dilation change.\nDuring the pore pressure changes, the load cylinder was maintained at a constant vertical position after the maximum displacement was reached. This way, the shear stress evolution was obtained from the measured vertical load (equation (7), Figs. 7a and 8a). When the pore pressure is varied, the effective normal stress is also changed, which can lead to slip events when a failure criterion is exceeded, resulting in a change in shear stress. For the 5\u00a0MPa effective pressure variation, a reduction in shear stress (\u201cslip event\u201d) was observed in the 5th and 6th cycle, reducing the shear stress by about 5\u00a0MPa. For the 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure variation the decrease in shear stress occurred in the 2nd cycle already with a larger magnitude of reduction of about 10\u00a0MPa. The vertical stress in the system could only be released towards the bottom of the sample, where the core of the sample was mounted on springs (top load piston was fixed). Since the dilation change suggested only small changes in lateral direction (Figs. 7c and 8c), we assume that this stress release resulted in a downward movement of the inner cylinder, such as a \u201cslip event\u201d, i.e. a small vertical displacement along the microfault. The friction coefficient could not be calculated since the normal stress was possibly disturbed by the sample and fracture geometry and needed to be determined numerically. The slip events resulted in a small reduction of permeability for a change of 5\u00a0MPa in pore pressure, accompanied by further fracture closure. Conversely, the slip event for the 10\u00a0MPa pore pressure change resulted in a slight increase in permeability and a dilation increase. However, the mechanical dilation was only measured at the centre of the intact portion (\n\n\nL\n\nI\nP\n\n\n\n), such that opening or closing during slip depends on the orientation of the fracture at this location.\nThe fracture stiffness, \n\u03c7\n, was obtained at each loading cycle during pore pressure reduction (equation (8)). It was observed that the fracture stiffness increases with each loading cycle and that fractures stiffness was higher when the initial effective pressure level was higher (Fig. 9), while the permeability was not significantly changing with an increasing number of pressure cycles. Generally, the permeability changes and fracture stiffness suggested a mechanically and hydraulically sustainable fracture.\n\n\n3.4\nFracture geometry from x-ray micro-CT scan analysis\nComputed x-ray CT scanning was performed using the entire sample after testing to visualize the deformation within the sample. We used a nanotom\u00ae ultra-high resolution nanoCT system with a 360\u00b0 scanning projection, providing a resolution for our sample size (50 by 50\u00a0mm) of about 25\u00a0\u03bcm. Computed x-ray CT scanning images of the microfaults in samples PRG6-RI-01-08 and PGR6-RI-01-09 revealed a complex microfault zone connecting the upper and lower notch of the sample (Fig. 10). The major fault zone was characterised by step-over structures, clearly displaced fracture faces with a visible self-propping effect, fracture branching, as well as particles or breccia distributed across the shear zone. Radial fractures and horizontal fractures were secondary features that formed during the unloading to atmospheric pressure at the end of the test and therefore do not contribute to permeability. They usually terminate against fracture branches of the central shear zone and are found in areas where the two fracture faces are in contact, thus minimising permeability.\nTrue apertures were measured at defined distances of about 0.5\u20130.8\u00a0mm along the fracture in x-y oriented cross sections at different height levels (21 levels with about 2300 measured apertures, \nN\n, for each sample) between the bottom and top notch (Fig. 10). Closed sections (apertures smaller 0.01\u00a0mm), as well as open sections were measured in order to obtain a contact-area ratio, \n\n\nR\nc\n\n\n, which was defined as the amount of contact points (zero aperture) over the total number of measurements, \nN\n. Based on the aperture distribution, mean aperture, contact area ratio and the structural features of specific areas along the vertical fracture, three specific zones were identified (zone I, II and III).\nFor sample PGR6-RI-01-08, zone I showed mostly apertures between 0.05 and 0.2\u00a0mm with mean apertures indicated in Fig. 10. The top part of the fracture was highly damaged and crushed. Below, a zone of transpressional features was visible with a mean aperture of 0.087 and a contact area ratio of 20% indicated as zone I. Zone II was characterised by almost vertically oriented fractures (simple shear zone) showing the highest contact area ratio of about 34% and a mean aperture of 0.089\u00a0mm. The largest zone was zone III characterised by an inclined fracture orientation and consequent transtension showing a highest mean aperture of 0.17\u00a0mm and a contact-area ratio of 31%.\nSample PGR6-RI-01-09 showed a similar distribution of zone I (transpression), zone II (simple shear) and zone III (transtension). However, the mean apertures were overall higher (0.175\u00a0mm), with zone II showing the smallest mean aperture of 0.110\u00a0mm and highest contact area-ratio of 41%. Furthermore, zone II was largest, meaning that the largest portion of the fracture was oriented vertically with simple shear features, and only small portions at the bottom show transtensional features.\nComparing samples PGR6-RI-01-08 and PGR6-RI-01-09, the latter had an overall lower mean aperture and higher contact-area ratio with the largest portion showing simple shearing, while the other had a larger zone of transtension with overall higher mean apertures and smaller contact area ratios. For both, shear zones cutting through feldspar minerals resulted in apertures of mostly zero while the largest open zones were found in quartz dominated areas. Fracture breccias or other fine and detached particles were found in every sample. The fact that they were located mostly in the bottom part of the fracture at the inflow zone indicates, that the particles were distributed and transported along the fracture, causing a further reduction in permeability.\nComparing the mechanical dilation (equation (5)) and volume-based dilation (equation (6.3)) with the aperture measured from the x-ray CT scan images, the post-testing CT images gave the largest mean aperture ranging from 0.09\u20130.18\u00a0mm while the mechanical dilation measured in-situ with extensometers gave 0.08\u20130.1\u00a0mm after failure.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nMicrofault generation\nShear fracture geometries generated in conventional fracture permeability experiments sometimes do not represent the complex geometry of single fault zone on a laboratory scale. In this section, the fracture properties, the fracture geometry regarding structural features, as well as implications of the aperture distribution for the overall permeability and strength, obtained by the PTS test, will be discussed.\nOur results suggest a sufficient reproducibility for this testing procedure in terms of mode II fracture toughness, yield point, as well as permeability and dilation evolution. Monitoring the changes in inflow and outflow volume of the pore fluid during failure allows for a good control of the fracturing process and reveals similar processes as described by Backers,\n37\n where the fracture initiated from the outer bottom notch and propagated towards the inner top notch. However, it is not clear from the experiments whether wing fractures, as described by Backers,\n37\n cause the initial increase in inflow rate and that the actual shear fracture might form later and more rapidly at the point of failure. The fracture toughness values of about 15.3\u201316.4\u00a0MPa*m0.5 were slightly higher compared to other granites, for example \u00c4vr\u00f6, Aue or Mizunami granite with values between 10.9\u201311.5\u00a0MPa*m0.5, tested under dry conditions.\n35\n While these experiments were performed at non-hydrostatic conditions, our experiments were performed with a confining stress acting on the top and bottom annulus of the sample. Furthermore, we were able to produce a single fracture at high effective pressures, which has been proven to be difficult in the past when applying mode II loading conditions in, for example, shear-box experiments.\n11\n\n\nWe favour the term \u201cmicrofault\u201d for the structures produced in our experiments, although Crider\n47\n suggested differentiating between shear fractures (experimentally produced) and faults (field structures). The reason is, that most of the existing experimental studies applied the term \u201cshear fracture\u201d to describe tensile fractures with offset, which is not adequate. Although there is a discussion about whether fracture initiation in PTS experiments is in shear mode,\n34\n the ongoing displacement of up to 1.2\u00a0mm clearly generated a principle shear plane with common features found in larger scale faults.\n48\n\n,\n\n49\n The microfault geometry of the PTS test is rather complex and can be subdivided into three domains that are also found in natural fault systems: transpression, simple shear zones, transtension.\n50\n\n,\n\n51\n The location of these systems along the fracture are assumed to control local permeability variation and depend on the fracture orientation, as well as on the degree of bending of the fault zone between top and bottom notch, and can also occur very locally. Transpression occurred mostly at the top of the sample, while transtension was found in the middle and lower section of the fracture zone. The fault zone structure is highly dependent on the stress and displacement magnitude, protolith and fluid flow.\n49\n A fine grained fault core (zone of reduced aperture), a fracture dominated damage zone and damage of linking damage structures\n49\n or \u201cdilational jogs\u201d\n48\n were found in both our samples (Fig. 10). Detailed thin section analysis and a comparison with other rock types might provide more insights into the development of a fault zone, microfracture density or fault zone dimensions using the PTS test, to be able to compare this to general shear zone developments.\n52\n In addition, the permeability can be adequately quantified due to the flow parallel orientation of fracture, meaning that compared to conventional tri-axial testing geometries, the fluid is not required to flow through a matrix before entering the fracture. Computed x-ray CT images also did show additional fractures such as radial fractures present in the matrix (Fig. 10). Due to the displacement and the interlocking of asperities the inner cylinder was pushing against the outer cylinder, which resulted in brittle radial fracturing exclusively during unloading to atmospheric pressure at the end of the experiment (secondary feature). There was no indication of radial fracturing during displacement or pore pressure cycling since they would result in a larger permeability increase. Monitoring the electric conductivity of a silver paste applied to the circumference of the sample suggests an intact sample wall during fracture generation. To reduce the possibility of radial fracture generation, we recommend to increase the diameter of the sample while keeping the diameter of the notches. Furthermore, the top of the inner diameter needs support (steel ring) for hydrostatic pressure conditions, as hydrostatic conditions reduce the difference of compressional and tensile forces at the bottom notch, which are required to initiate shear fracture growth.\n37\n This possibly also explains the slightly higher load, or more precise, higher fracture toughness values, required for fracture generation.\n\n\n4.2\nPermeability and dilation evolution during fracturing and shearing\nQuantifying and understanding the physical properties and processes that control the hydraulic-mechanical properties of fractured rocks are crucial for any engineering application in the subsurface. Experimental data of the generation and displacement of a single shear fracture zone under in-situ reservoir and fracture parallel flow conditions while measuring permeability are limited in the present literature. In the following, we will discuss our results of the permeability of microfaults framed in the context of existing approaches and outcomes in existing literature (Fig. 11\n).\nIn order to compare the measured permeability pre-, during and post-failure, the measured value should represent a pseudo steady-state value. To ensure these conditions we calculated the hydraulic diffusivity and the additional fluxes caused by the fracture formation. The diffusivity of 4.5*10-6\u00a0m2\/s was calculated according to Nicholas et al.,\n43\n resulting in a pore pressure diffusion to take less than 10\u00a0min. Furthermore, the generated fracture volume was measured to be maximum 0.2\u00a0ml within 90\u00a0min, while the applied flow rates varied between 0.4\u00a0ml\/min and 1\u00a0ml\/min. We concluded that both effects could be neglected for the permeability evolution during shearing, but consider the permeability during fracturing as transient.\nOur results show that the magnitude of permeability enhancement is about 2 to almost 3 orders of magnitude, from less than 10\u221218\u00a0m2 to more than 10\u221216\u00a0m,\n2\n for a medium grained fresh granite such as the Odenwald granite with a sample diameter of 50\u00a0mm. This is more than the 17 to 35 times permeability increase reported by Ye & Ghassemi\n28\n on Sierra White Granite for their double flawed samples with a complex shear zone. However, it is similar to the experiments on Westerly granite and Cerro Cristales granodiorite by Mitchell & Faulkner\n20\n (Fig. 11b) using the pore pressure oscillation technique in conventional tri-axial testing at effective pressures of 10\u201350\u00a0MPa. Similar to their study, we assume that the damage in the surrounding rock matrix is negligible and that permeability is exclusively controlled by the generated microfault. The fracture volume evolution in the experiments by Mitchell and Faulker\n20\n shows a similar inflection at about 70\u201390% of the peak stress, although permeability increases already at lower strain, i.e. at about 60% of peak strain. The differences in fracture volume (Fig. 11c) arise from the sample and fracture geometry, or more precise, the fact that pore fluid can hardly travel through the rock matrix at the bottom and top of the sample in a tri-axial test, while there is an instant hydraulic connection and flow-parallel conditions in the PTS test. Generally, both results demonstrate that measuring permeability over more than three orders of magnitude experimentally during fracture initiation and propagation remains technically difficult. Still, similar to the experiments by De Paola et al.,\n16\n the permeability evolution can be subdivided into three stages: compaction, dilation and post-failure, with the transition from compaction to dilation between 60 to 80% of peak strain. Assuming that Mitchell and Faulkner\n20\n rather measured pre-failure permeability evolution and that our results show the permeability increase during failure and at post-failure state, the total increase by brittle faulting can exceed 3 orders of magnitude (Fig. 10).\nThe bulk permeability of a fault is controlled by the size of the fault zone and the aperture resulting from shear dilation. The mechanical and volume based dilation, as well as fracture volume, are commonly used to determine the aperture changes in fractures due to changes in load,\n5\n but present only bulk measurements for certain locations along the fracture. The x-ray CT images (Fig. 11) showed that local permeability is controlled by the distribution of aperture, which is again controlled by the fracture geometry and grain size. Similar to the study by Frash et al.,\n12\n aperture and therefore permeability are highly controlled by the presence of en-echelon or step-over structures, as well as fault particle transportation along the fault. Experimental studies with planar structures might simplify the processes involved,\n25\u201327\n but do not reflect the evolution of permeability in active faults.\nWe demonstrated the ability to shear a fracture at an effective pressure of 20\u00a0MPa using the PTS test. Permeability increased by a factor of 1.1 to 4.0 by shearing under in-situ conditions right after producing the shear zone. Such an increase is comparable to experiments with sheared tensile fractures in other studies.\n21\n\n,\n\n24\n A high dependence on the grain size is involved in the mechanical processes during shearing of a microfault, due to the sample size on a laboratory scale. The applied displacement did not exceed the grain size of the material and therefore no stick-slip behaviour, commonly observed in large scale fault mechanisms, was observed in our experiments. The realistic microfault geometry causes a heterogeneous aperture distribution, which highlights the importance of structural features, such as en-echelon or step-over structures, in faults during the displacement. We therefore also support the assumption that local pressure gradients play an critical role in controlling local permeability perturbations, when fluid is directly injected into a fault zone,\n53\n as well as when fluid is injected in an adjacent well.\n\n\n4.3\nSustainability of permeability\nThe sustainability of the permeability of fault structures, in other words, the resistance of a fracture towards closing caused by pressure changes, is crucial for several underground applications. In the following chapter, we will discuss our results of longevity for microfault permeability and compare those with data from tensile and displaced tensile fractures published in literature (Fig. 12\na and b).\nFault compaction due to elevated normal stress can significantly reduce the permeability of a microfault. Because of the relatively short testing period, we assume that no chemical rock-fluid interactions impact the hydraulic properties of the fracture. However, we could not consider possible particle redistribution affecting permeability. We therefore recommend to analyse the effluent in future studies. The observed reduction in permeability over time after shear fracture formation by a factor of 2.5 to 4 might be related to three possible mechanisms: (a) chemical rock-fluid interactions, i.e. dissolution or precipitation of minerals, (b) fines migration leading to a blockage of fluid pathways within the fault, and (c) mechanical creep, i.e. compaction or rearrangement of fault gouge particles. Mechanical back-slip is not possible, since the axial displacement piston was held in place after reaching a maximum of 1.2\u00a0mm.\nRock-fluid interactions, re-crystallizations or cementations are unlikely to influence permeability in our short-term experiments (several hours). Such processes evolve over long time-scales of several weeks\n33\n and require saline solution as the pore fluid while we used distilled water, such it is unlikely that this impacted permeability. For longer term experiments, such processes should be considered to impact fault permeability. Possible fines migration cannot be assessed in this study since it requires a microstructural analysis of the microfault. Comparing our data to literature data, the permeability decay curves over time are similar to those in literature\n5\n\n,\n\n27\n for exponential or power law decay, although the normal effective stress range conditions (from 3 to 60\u00a0MPa) and fracture type (smooth saw-cut or displaced tensile type) differ to our study (Fig. 12a). Other authors suggest a linear decay\n54\n of permeability over several days, which did not fit our data. This might be caused by an insufficient resolution of permeability of the first 24\u00a0h in these tests. The main factor controlling the permeability decay cannot be explained by the data we obtained, but permeability losses up to one order of magnitude are possible within the first 16\u00a0h.\nConsidering pore pressure changes of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0MPa to\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0MPa that simulate injection and production procedures in geothermal systems, permeability increased with decreasing effective pressure and decreased by less than one order of magnitude. This process was rather reversible.\nIn Fig. 12b we compared our permeability during the effective pressure loading to fracture permeability data from literature for displaced and non-displaced tensile fractures. To be able to compare our sample permeability data, we need to calculate the fracture permeability, \n\n\nk\nf\n\n\n, assuming that the permeability relates to the area of flow following Hofmann et al.\n5\n:\n\n(9.1)\n\n\n\nA\ns\n\n\nk\ns\n\n=\n\nA\nm\n\n\nk\nm\n\n+\n\nA\nf\n\n\nk\nf\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nk\n is permeability, \nA\n is area of flow and the subscripts \ns\n, \nm\n, \nf\n relate to sample, matrix and fracture, respectively. The area of the sample is approximated by \n\n\nA\ns\n\n\n=\n\u03c0\n\nr\n2\n\n\n and the fracture area is calculated from the circumference of the fracture multiplied by the aperture \n\n\nA\nf\n\n=\n\na\nh\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n(\n\n2\n\nr\n\nI\nD\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n, with \n\n2\n\nr\n\nI\nD\n\n\n=\nr\n\n. If we now assume that the matrix permeability of the granite is negligible (\n\n\nk\nm\n\n=\n0\n\n), we can rearrange equation (9.1) for the fracture permeability, which is given by the cubic law (\n\n\nk\nf\n\n=\n\na\n2\n\n\/\n12\n\n):\n\n(9.2)\n\n\n\na\n2\n\n\/\n12\n=\n\n(\n\nk\ns\n\n\u03c0\n\nr\n2\n\n)\n\n\/\n\n(\nr\n\u03c0\n\na\nh\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis provides an equation for the hydraulic aperture similar to Hofmann et al.,\n5\n but for a circular fracture:\n\n(9.3)\n\n\n\na\nh\n\n=\n\n\n12\n\nk\ns\n\nr\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInserting the hydraulic aperture, \n\n\na\nh\n\n\n, into the cubic law we obtain the fracture permeability (\n\n\nk\nf\n\n=\n\na\n2\n\n\/\n12\n\n), that we can now compare to the fracture permeability from the literature. The permeability reference value for normalisation at 10\u00a0MPa for our data is 1.97*10-12\u00a0m2. Comparing the permeability loss during the first loading cycle to other studies\n5\n\n,\n\n11\n\n,\n\n29\n\n,\n\n30\n the permeability loss at the respective effective pressures are similar in magnitude with displaced fractures, during the first loading cycle when normalizing permeability to the permeability at 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure (Fig. 12b). Permeability loss at lower effective pressure is strongly affected by the experimental set up and is usually higher, such that those pressures are not considered here. Generally, displaced fractures and the microfaults in our study have a higher resistance to fracture closure compared to fractures without displacement. Higher displacements result in a higher sustainability of fracture permeability when comparing our results to those by Watanabe et al.\n11\n and Chen et al.\n29\n This implies, that the type of fracturing (matched tensile, displaced tensile or shear fracturing) is a key aspect when assessing the performance and sustainability of, for example, a geothermal reservoir. Moreover, all literature values presented here\n5\n\n,\n\n11\n\n,\n\n29\n\n,\n\n30\n result from increasing confining pressure while in our experiments the pore pressure was decreased at constant confining pressure. In this context, we recommend to consider effective pressure coefficients\n31\n\n,\n\n55\n instead of using Terzaghi's effective pressure. However, these coefficients are highly dependent on the rock type used and need to be determined experimentally.\n31\n Changes in pore pressure, as in our experiments, are likely to have a smaller impact on fracture permeability, meaning that the change in permeability per step effective pressure is larger, assuming a coefficient of 0.9 for granite.\n56\n Considering several pressure cycles, the permanent permeability change in the presented experiments with six pressure cycles was an increase by a factor less than 1.4. Other studies suggested a reduction in permeability of up to one order of magnitude after two cycles, with the highest permeability damage during the first loading stage.\n5\n We argue that the permeability of a microfault generated under in-situ conditions might be reversible due to the lack of plastic energy in the system. In experiments with displaced tensile fractures\n5\n for example, the fracture preparation, i.e. placing two sample halves together by hand, causes a high amount of plastic energy. Under external load asperities break and the fracture re-arranges itself, causing a permanent permeability decrease in every loading cycle. This is not the case for in-situ fracture generation in the PTS test. Furthermore, aperture closure analysis suggests a stiffening of the fracture zone, i.e. less closure at similar stress,\n32\n with an increasing number of cycles, indicating compaction and stiffening effects during pressure cycling. The observed slip events when increasing the pore pressure lead to a minor permeability increase, as well as in a further stiffening of the fracture. Long-term permeability changes at high pressure and temperature of such small faults are required in the future to compare their behaviour to, for example, displaced tensile fractures.\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nOur experiments demonstrated an innovative technique to quantify the changes in permeability by introducing a shear fracture (microfault) in a previously intact rock sample simultaneous to fluid flow and at elevated effective pressure (pore and confining pressure). We modified the PTS setup by allowing for hydrostatic loading conditions, for the application of a controlled displacement after failure using a spring-supported core holder system, and for continuous fluid flow by introducing fluid ports to the end caps. A meaningful interpretation of the magnitude of fracture permeability change by introducing a realistic microscopic fault zone was therefore possible. Our results help to better understand and characterise the hydraulic and mechanical properties, as well as the sustainability of faulted reservoirs in general.\nThe following general conclusions can be drawn from our results: (1) the microfault geometry produced is rather complex but contains features that are commonly found in large scale fault zones, (2) the spatial distribution of aperture suggests a very local permeability distribution along the central shear zone, (3) permeability enhancement by brittle faulting in crystalline rock is about 2 to almost 3 orders of magnitude, while permeability increases at 60\u201380% of peak load, (4) shearing causes a slight increase in permeability by a factor of 1.1 to 4.0 which is possibly caused by the displacement magnitude being below grain size, (5) after compaction has ceased, which can cause reductions in permeability by a factor of 2.5 to 4, the generated microfault is hydraulically and mechanically sustainable when varying pore pressure by\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 to\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0MPa, (6) permeability is rather reversible and slight changes during pressure cycling are mainly caused by processes altering shear stress, (7) the resistance of a microfault to fracture closure at increasing effective pressure is in the range of displaced tensile fractures, and (8) the fracture types are a significant aspect when assessing the reservoir performance on a larger scale.\nIn the future, the dependence of fracture permeability on confining pressure and different rock types should be tested in order to quantify microfault permeability depending on rock type and rock physical properties. Additionally, acoustic emission monitoring would allow for better description on possible induced seismicity and permeability distribution of brittle fault zones in crystalline rock during effective pressure change.\n\n","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAs a result of hydrocarbon pore pressure depletion the reservoir rock starts to compact, causing changes in stresses and strains inside and surrounding the reservoir.\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n One of the consequences can be mechanical re-activation of faults, posing several geomechanical hazards such as causing new intra-reservoir hydraulic communication pathways\n3\n or in extreme cases the fault slip can continue to propagate outside the reservoir posing cap-rock integrity problems. If the re-activated fault plane is crossed by a well, serious well integrity problems can occur, as observed in the HPHT Shearwater field.\n4\n Fault slip can also cause seismicity as has been observed in many depleting hydrocarbon reservoirs worldwide.\n5\u201311\n In addition, several authors have addressed fault mechanics in relation to reservoir pressure changes resulting from injection or depletion\n12\u201318\n and related to micro-seismic monitoring during (hydraulic fracture stimulated) injection processes.\n19\u201321\n In these studies the initiation criterion is usually based on a Mohr-Coulomb stress analysis, assuming the earth stresses are principal stresses thereby neglecting the possible consequences of differential compaction. Geomechanical aspects of depletion-induced seismicity in the Netherlands have been studied analytically and numerically.\n22\u201328\n In many studies, however, the role of differential displacement-induced shear stress (called \u201cdifferential compaction\u201d) has been neglected.\nThe main objective of this study is to describe the mechanics of fault re-activation in depleting reservoirs using the fault geometry and properties as a starting point. The article starts by describing the geological setting and various fault categories present in the subsurface of the Netherlands. A new Coulomb stress function has been developed to determine the reservoir pressure depletion necessary to re-activate pre-existing fault planes of weakness. Two mechanisms are considered: Poro-elastic stressing and differential displacement-induced shear stress. During the development of the Coulomb stability relationship these two mechanisms are not combined by transferring the problem to principal stresses but are rather kept separate for better analysis. The relationships are developed for the full dip range from normal dipping to reverse dipping faults. The poro-elastic stress effects are then determined for open, (partly) sealing and boundary faults. The induced shear stress is derived in terms of differential displacements on either side of the fault plane, also termed \u201cdifferential compaction\u201d. Thereafter the slip tendencies and the stress couples are analysed, important for the analysis of earthquake focal mechanisms. The article describes, in a stepwise manner, the full methodology used to determine the critical reservoir depletion pressure for fault re-activation. Finally the results are applied to determine analytical solutions for critical depletion pressures for three fault categories, open intra-reservoir faults, (partly) sealing intra-reservoir faults and boundary faults. For each category the critical depletion pressures are presented in relation to the fault dip. A summary including discussion and conclusions is given at the end.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting, assumptions and fault categories\nThis study applies to the Permian Rotliegend gas fields in the Dutch subsurface, which display a depth range of 2000 to 4700\u00a0m, although most are situated at depths between 2800 \u2013 4000\u00a0m.\n29\n Generally the underlying Carboniferous coal seams serve as source rock and the overlying Zechstein halite acts as the reservoir seal. Gr\u00f6tsch et al.\n30\n give a geological overview of the Groningen gas field and Ligtenberg et al.\n31\n demonstrate how the origin of the Rotliegend faulting is related to the regional tectonic history that also has led to the observed reservoir compartmentalisation. Kortekaas and Jaarsma\n32\n give a fault characterization of the Groningen field based on seismic attributes. As shown by Dost and Haak,\n33\n The Netherlands has some natural seismic activity in the South-East, where some faults in the Roer Valley rift system are active.\n34\n The system is part of the Lower Rhine Graben and started to be tectonically active from the Miocene onward.\n35\n For this study that area is excluded and the normal faulting stress regime is assumed with the vertical stress being the major principal stress. Only reservoirs in a passive basement environment are considered far away from tectonic plate boundaries, major faults or diapirs, assuming no horizontal stress anisotropy, \n\n\nS\nH\n\n=\n\nS\nh\n\n\n. Based on analyses of sonic scanner and borehole breakout inversion a very low ambient stress ratio in the range of \n\n\nS\nH\n\n\/\n\nS\nh\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n1.2\n\n has been reported by Van Eijs\n36\n for the Permian formation in the Groningen field.\nThis justifies the use of a two-dimensional model. Furthermore, to arrive to analytical solutions also a planar simplification is applied to reservoir faults characterized by its location (intra reservoir\/boundary), fault dip (normal\/vertical\/reverse), fault throw and hydraulic transmissibility (open\/partly sealing\/boundary). The presented results apply only locally as long as the planar fault simplification holds. Fig. 1\n shows a typical Rotliegend reservoir setting in the Dutch subsurface, having a horst-graben structure with some strike-slip faulting. It is also assumed that pure dip-slip occurs during normal\/reverse fault re-activation, without any strike-slip component. For this study, ten fault categories are categorized, eight intra-reservoir and two boundary faults. Table 1\n lists the fault categories together with their dominant stressing mechanisms and Fig. 2\n shows them in profile.\n\n\n3\nShear stress on a fault plane of weakness\nA shear-stress based criterion is defined to determine the initiation of re-activation along pre-existing fault planes of weakness in depleting reservoirs. The basic Mohr-Coulomb criterion can be applied to both the initiation of shear failure of intact rock as well as re-activation along pre-existing fault planes of weakness\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n and to post-failure frictional sliding.\n39\n The general Mohr-Coulomb criterion reads:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nm\nc\n\n\n=\n\ns\n0\n\n+\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c4\n\nm\nc\n\n\n\n [Pa] is the shear strength of the fault, \n\n\ns\n0\n\n\n [Pa] is the cohesion or the intrinsic shear strength, \n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n [Pa] is the normal effective stress on the fault plane and \n\n\u03bc\n=\ntan\n\n\u03c6\n\n, the friction coefficient where \n\u03c6\n is the friction angle. The Coulomb stability function CS [Pa] is defined as the difference between the shear stress loading of the fault and the shear strength of the fault:\n\n(2)\n\n\nC\nS\n=\n\n|\n\u03c4\n|\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\n\nm\nc\n\n\n=\n\n|\n\u03c4\n|\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n\ns\n0\n\n+\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stability criterion states that mechanical fault re-activation and subsequent sliding can only occur when the fault shear stress loading exceeds the shear strength of the fault. For stable faults \n\nC\nS\n<\n0\n\n while the fault becomes unstable if \n\nC\nS\n\u2265\n0\n\n. From a balance of forces and moments the shear stress and the normal effective stress on the fault plane can be resolved by\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u03c4\n=\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n\nsin\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\n+\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n\n\ncos\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\nm\n\n+\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n\ncos\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\n+\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n\n\nsin\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n\n\n [Pa] is the (induced) shear stress and the poro-elastic stress components, the maximum shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n\n [Pa] and the mean effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\nm\n\n\n [Pa] are:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\nh\n\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\n\ns\nv\n\n\u2212\n\ns\nh\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nm\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n+\n\n\u03c3\nh\n\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\n\ns\nv\n\n+\n\ns\nh\n\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b1\n1\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parameter \n\n\n\u03b1\n1\n\n\n will be defined and explained later in Eq. (16). The geometry of these stress components are resolved on the fault plane as shown in Fig. 3\n. Here \u03b2 [rad] is the angle between the fault normal and the maximum stress direction. The dip angle has a full range between \n\n0\n<\n\u03b2\n<\n\u03c0\n\n for both normal and reverse dipping faults. For normal dipping faults in a normal faulting stress regime the vertical stress is the maximum stress and \u03b2 equals the dip of the fault. Reference 38 shows that normal failure is only possible for \n\n\u03c6\n<\n\u03b2\n<\n\u03c0\n\/\n2\n\n. In case of the presence of an induced shear stress, \n\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\nh\nv\n\n\n\u2260\n0\n\n. Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) are generally valid but the Coulomb stress function (Eq. (2)) requires the absolute value of the shear stress. The shear stress changes sign for dip angles at which the shear stress (from Eq. (3)) becomes zero:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n=\n0\n\n)\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n\ntan\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n=\n\n\u03b2\n\nr\no\nt\n\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \n\n\n\u03b2\n\nr\no\nt\n\n\n\n is also the rotation angle for the co-ordinate system for transfer to principal stresses, as shown by.\n37\n It will be shown later that the magnitude of the induced shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n\n\n depends on the reservoir depletion pressure. Its sign, and thus that of the rotation angle, can be positive or negative depending on the slip tendency, which will be described later. Fig. 4\n shows an example calculation of the shear stress on the fault plane in case of a positive induced shear stress, a negative induced shear stress and when the induced shear stress is absent. Equation (7) shows that the stress rotation influences shear stress sign changes around two horizontal dips (0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0) and the vertical (90\u00b0). The validity range for failure and slip requires \n\n\u03c6\n<\n\u03b2\n<\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n\n. Since usually \n\n\n|\n\n\n\u03b2\n\nr\no\nt\n\n\n\n|\n\n<\n\u03c6\n\n, only the stress rotations around the very low-angle fault planes are neglected. Around near-vertical fault planes, for fault dips in range of \n\n\u03b2\n\u2264\n\u03c0\n\/\n2\n+\n\n\u03b2\n\nr\no\nt\n\n\n\n (so for most normal dipping faults) the absolute value of the shear stress (from Eq. (3)) becomes:\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n|\n\u03c4\n|\n\n=\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n=\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n\nsin\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n\n\ncos\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n\n\n\nFor fault dips in range of \n\n\u03b2\n>\n\u03c0\n\/\n2\n+\n\n\u03b2\n\nr\no\nt\n\n\n\n (so for most reverse dipping faults) the absolute value of the shear stress becomes: \n\n\n|\n\u03c4\n|\n\n=\n\u03c4\n\n. For a vertical fault, Eq. (3) shows that a shear stress can only be generated in the presence of an induced shear stress, since \n\n\u03c4\n\n(\n\n\u03c0\n\/\n2\n\n)\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n\n\n and the normal effective fault stress (from eq.

The extreme value of the shear stress on the fault plane is given by:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\u03c4\n|\n\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c4\nm\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03c4\n\nv\nh\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is deliberately not transferred to principal stress axes for several reasons. Firstly, this methodology allows independent analysis of the contributions from poro-elastic stressing and differential strain-induced shear stress. Secondly, the main variable remains the real fault dip and not the rotated fault dip. Thirdly, this methodology allows a more simple determination of how the two contributions depend on reservoir pressure depletion. However, this methodology requires very careful consideration of the signs of the shear stresses. Since the model relates to the Earth's stresses, the Earth coordinate system is chosen (vertical and two horizontally perpendicular) rather than to rotate the near-fault stresses to principal stresses. As a consequence, in the presence of an induced shear stress the Earth's stresses are not principal stresses while in the absence of differential strain, the earth's vertical and horizontal stresses become principal stresses. The general criterion for fault re-activation is developed for all fault categories by introducing Eq. (3), Eq. (4) and Eq. (8) to Eq. (2). The new Coulomb stability function is written in terms of the maximum shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n\n, the mean effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\nm\n\n\n, the induced shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\nh\nv\n\n\n\n and the fault friction coefficient \u03bc and its cohesive shear strength \n\n\ns\n0\n\n\n:\n\n(10)\n\n\nC\nS\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n,\n\n\u03c3\nm\n\n,\n\n\u03c4\n\nh\nv\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\nq\n\np\ne\n\n\n\n\u03c4\nm\n\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\nm\n\n+\n\nq\n\nd\nc\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nh\nv\n\n\n\u2212\n\ns\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Coulomb stress increases the hazard for fault instability increases.

The vertical displacements of the different compacting reservoirs are \n\n\nu\nI\n\n\n and \n\n\nu\n\nI\nI\n\n\n\n, which are defined positive upwards. Fig. 6\n shows two differently compacting reservoirs, with reservoir I having the largest compaction.

Note also that the shear stress can be positive or negative, controlling the slip tendency. The vertical displacements u are defined as upwards positive (see Appendix A). Fig. 6 shows that in this example the slip tendency is sinistral, i.e. having an \u201canti-clockwise\u201d rotation direction. Section 7 will demonstrate how the sign of the shear stress determines the slip tendency and the resulting stress couple.

Direct application of Eq. (26) to generate the shear stress profile requires knowledge of the shear influence distance, which can be related to the reservoir dimensions, but can also be location-dependent along the fault-plane. Several authors\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n analysed the influence distance in relation to earthquake moment strengths and found for this application the effective influence distance to be related to the smallest dimension of the fault slip plane. For analysis of slip along fault planes crossing the entire reservoir the authors suggested the influence distance to be proportional to the thickness of the reservoir, \n\n\n\u039b\nf\n\n=\nc\nH\n\n. Numerical simulations performed by Platteeuw\n42\n showed that \n\nc\n\u2192\n0.5\n\n for large distances from the fault plane, while \n\n0.25\n<\nc\n<\n0.4\n\n was found to best match numerical simulated shear stress profiles with the analytical solution for typical reservoir dimensions.

The calculated shear stress profile is shown in Fig. 7\n, based on the input parameters and results shown in Table 3\n. It is noted that the solution is not accurate in detail, since both vertical displacement profiles (zero outside the reservoir and uniaxial strain-based inside the reservoir) are poor approximations close to the boundary fault plane, especially in radial direction and close to the reservoir corners. Nevertheless, it is believed that the presented maximum shear stresses and the average shear stress are applicable as first-order approximations. The extreme induced shear stresses occur at the top (upper signs) and the base (lower signs) of the reservoir and can be approximated by\n\n(36)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nh\nv\n\n\n\n(\n\nD\n\u2213\n\nH\n2\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\u2212\nd\ns\n\n(\n\n\u0394\np\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\nr\nc\n\u00b1\n\n\n\nf\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince under depletion the driving stress is negative and both functions rc and f\n3 are positive, the maximum shear occurs at the top of the reservoir and has a positive sign. This explains why, for all other factors being equal, the top of the reservoir is more prone to seismicity than the base. In summary, the full equations (29) and (31) gives insight in the factors and mechanisms contributing to the magnitude of the shear stress induced by differential strain. It is controlled by the difference in driving stresses, the reservoir geometries and the fault throw. For (partly) sealing faults or boundary faults the driving stress is proportional to the pressure difference over the fault plane. Equation (32) demonstrates the relative importance of the contribution of the average (central depth) displacement (through the rc function) compared to that of the compaction (through the term with f\n3 function). Equation (33) shows that the fault throw adds a constant (depth-independent) contribution to the shear stress. The presented analytical model results apply directly to intra-reservoir faults with reservoir-to-reservoir contact and boundary faults. Faults with a throw will also separate reservoir rock from non-reservoir rock at the top and base, such that the boundary fault analysis will be more applicable. Table 4\n summarizes the induced shear stress mechanisms and the relationships in the expected sequence of increasing magnitude.\n\n\n7\nSlip tendencies and stress couples\nBefore the fault slips, force balance requires the shear stress on one side of the fault to be opposed by the same shear stress in opposite direction on the other side of the fault plane. The resulting stress couple either causes a sinistral (anti-clockwise) slip tendency or a dextral (clockwise) slip tendency. For the differential displacement component the slip tendency is controlled by the displacements, which for a depleting reservoir is downwards at the top and centre of the reservoir and upwards at the base of the reservoir as shown in Figure A.2. Fig. 8\n shows two cases of slip tendencies, one for the normal dipping fault plane (towards the largest compacting reservoir) and one for the reverse dipping fault plane (towards the least compacting reservoir). For a single formation the amount of compaction is given by \n\n\u0394\nH\n=\n\nC\nm\n\n\u0394\np\nH\n\n (see Appendix A). Results are summarized in Table 5\n. If the fault dips towards the largest compacting reservoir, at the top and at the central depth of the reservoir both the poro-elastic stress and the differential strain-induced stress have the same slip tendencies and their contributions add, leading to an anti-clockwise stress couple. The base of the reservoir experiences opposite slip tendencies. In this case the maximum shear stress occurs at the top of the reservoir and at this location the initiation of normal slip will occur. If the fault dips towards the least compacting reservoir addition of the two slip tendencies occurs at the base, causing initiation of normal slip in clockwise direction. The top of the reservoir and the central reservoir depth experience opposite slip tendencies. Fig. 5 shows that for fault dip angles around the critical dip the poro-elastic stresses are dominant but for very steep faults the differential compaction loading could become the dominant mechanism. These slip tendencies can also be used to determine the generated stress couple that could be important to both the localization, source mechanism and the strength of earthquakes. It is concluded that for faults dipping towards the largest compacting section, earthquakes are expected to be initiated at the top of the reservoir while for faults dipping towards the least compacting section, earthquake initiation can also initiate at the base of the reservoir.\n\n\n8\nMethodology to determine the critical reservoir depletion pressure for fault re-activation\nTo determine reservoir pressure at which mechanical fault re-activation occurs the Coulomb stability function in Eq.

The condition for fault instability to occur is that the Coulomb stress function becomes positive during depletion:\n\n(39)\n\n\nC\nS\n\n(\n\n\u0394\np\n\n)\n\n=\nC\n\nS\ni\n\n+\n\n\n\u0394\nC\nS\n\n\n\u0394\np\n\n\n\u0394\np\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe initial Coulomb stress reads (the subscript i refers to the initial, pre-production state):\n\n(40)\n\n\nC\n\nS\ni\n\n=\n\nq\n\np\ne\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nm\n,\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\n\nm\n,\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\ns\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the initial (pre-production) earth stresses are free of induced shear stresses and if all reservoir faults are initially stable, then \n\nC\n\nS\ni\n\n<\n0\n\n.

Fig. 9\n shows an example calculation of the initial Coulomb stress demonstrating the influence of the friction angle. The cohesive strength causes a constant reduction of the initial Coulomb stress, independent of the fault angle. Initially the faults with a critical angle \n\n\n\u03b2\nc\n\n\n are the most prone to re-activation. In this example weak faults with a friction angle of 24\u00b0 will re-activate quickly after depletion. Note that if the factor \n\n\nq\n\nd\nc\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\nv\nh\n\n\n\u0394\np\n>\n0\n\n in Eq.

Since under depletion \n\n\u0394\np\n<\n0\n\n and for normal faults steeper than the critical \n\n\u03b2\n>\n\n\u03b2\nc\n\n\n, \n\n\nq\n\nd\nc\n\n\n>\n0\n\n (see Fig. 5) this can happen only if \n\n\n\u03b3\n\nv\nh\n\n\n<\n0\n\n.

Our example plane of weakness friction angle of 24\u00b0 is well below the critical, confirming the re-activation potential. Application of the appropriate poro-elastic sensitivities of Eq.

(49). Applying the input numbers listed in Table 3 and initial stresses shown in Fig. 9 to relationship (54) results in the re-activation depletion pressures shown in Fig. 10\n. The results are summarized in Table 6\n, showing that as the fault throw increases, the induced shear stress and the stress rotation angle increase and the critical reservoir depletion pressure for re-activation decreases for faults dipping at angles above the critical. Fig. 10 also shows that as the fault throw increases, even vertical open faults become prone to mechanical re-activation. Appendix B shows that for laterally extensive reservoirs there is no stress arching and the vertical stress path approaches zero (\n\n\n\u03b3\nv\n\n\u2192\n0\n\n). In that case the frictional stability criterion (52) results in the following necessary critical horizontal stress path for instability (see also\n44\n):\n\n(55)\n\n\n\n\u03b3\nh\n\n>\n\n\u03b3\n\nh\n,\nc\n\n\n=\n\n\n2\n\u03b1\n\nsin\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n1\n+\nsin\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis relationship was also applied by Addis et al.\n45\n with \n\n\u03b1\n=\n1\n\n as well as by Holt et al.\n46\n to determine the minimum stress response in an active normal faulting region. In general, Biot's coefficient \u03b1 plays an important role when the critical friction coefficient is related to stress paths. Fig. 11\n shows the critical friction angle in relation to the horizontal stress path for various values of Biot's coefficient. For sandstone reservoirs Biot's coefficient from Eq. (18) ranges from about 0.6 (low porosity) to 1.0 (unconsolidated) due to the porosity-dependence of the bulk modulus and using a grain bulk modulus of 37\u00a0GPa.\n41\n For carbonate reservoirs, however, Biot's coefficient can have a very large range from very high (up to 1.0) for highly porous chalk reservoirs having a very low bulk modulus,\n47\n but Biot's coefficient was estimated to be very low for low porosity limestone reservoirs (\u03340.25),\n48\n having a grain bulk modulus in excess of 70\u00a0GPa. Fig. 11 demonstrates that towards higher stress paths the critical friction angle increases rapidly, favourable to initiate re-activation of faults. Santarelli et al.\n49\n report reservoir stress paths ranging from 0.4 to 1.0, but for sandstone reservoirs typically limited within the range of 0.5 to 0.8. A very high stress path of \n\n\n\u03b3\nh\n\n=\n0.8\n\n has been reported by Teufel et al.\n47\n for the Ekofisk chalk field in the North Sea. The friction coefficient may typically vary between 20 and 40\u00b0, with lower-end values for clay-mineral rich shale and chalk while the higher-end values are for clean quartz-rich sandstone, dolomite and limestone (\n37\n \u00a73.4,\n50\n). Fig. 11 shows the results for a reservoir with a vertical stress path of 0.9 only applicable to faults in categories 1 and 3 in the absence of stress arching. The example reservoir with a horizontal stress path of 0.65 and Biot's coefficient of 0.9 would require a minimum fault friction angle of 31.6\u00b0 to rule out intra-reservoir fault re-activation. However, the slip activation could lead to dilation of the fault plane causing opening of and full hydraulic connectivity along the fault plane. As a consequence, the dynamic mechanical stability is best described by a sudden increase of Biot's coefficient to 1.0, causing the critical friction angle to drop from 31.6\u00b0 to 26.1\u00b0. Note that this \u201cBiot-effect\u201d can cause slip-controlled post-failure frictional weakening of the fault. For laterally extensive reservoirs the horizontal stress path approaches the uniaxial strain stress path, which can be written in terms of material parameters (see Eq. (B.9)), such that criterion (52) results in the following instability criterion in terms of a critical Poisson's ratio:\n\n(56)\n\n\n\u03bd\n<\n\n\u03bd\nc\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n\n\u03b3\nh\n\n\n\n2\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n\n\u03b3\nh\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nsin\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when expressed in terms of Poisson's ratio, Biot's coefficient plays no role. It should be noted that Eq. (55) and Eq. (56) assume no stress arching and the vertical stress path being zero. However, when applied to real reservoirs this assumption will lead to a systematic under-estimation of the hazard for fault re-activation and it is therefore recommended to always estimate the vertical reservoir stress path from the reservoir geometry as suggested in Appendix B. This analysis shows that for throw-less intra-reservoir faults the main controlling parameters are the friction angle, the stress paths and Biot's coefficient.\n\n\n10\nRe-activation analysis for (partly) sealing intra-reservoir faults\nIn this section the fault re-activation analysis is presented for (partly) sealing intra-reservoir faults of categories 2, 4, 6 and 8 in Table 1.

The results are summarized in Table 8\n. From this example it is concluded that re-activation of boundary faults is only possible under very special conditions, namely for steeply dipping faults with a small range of relative low friction angles between 21.5 and 23.5\u00b0. With these initial conditions applied, a fault with a low friction angle above 23.5\u00b0 can not be re-activated even when depleting down to 0\u00a0MPa absolute pressure. Conversely, the presence of faults with a friction angle below 21.1\u00b0 is unlikely in a pre-production stable earth.\n\n\n12\nSummary, discussion and conclusions\nA new general Coulomb stability relationship has been developed that allows the determination of the stability of all fault types in depleting reservoirs in a normal-faulting stress regime. The critical reservoir pressure depletion under which mechanical re-activation along fault planes of weakness can occur has been developed analytically. The analysis shows how the fault dip controls these two contributions for both normal dipping and reverse dipping faults. The poro-elastic stresses have a maximum sensitivity at the critical angles while the induced shear stress has a maximum sensitivity at very steep reverse faults with a dip angle equal to vertical plus half the friction angle. The ratio of the induced shear stress over the poro-elastic stress has a maximum for vertical faults. The depletion-induced poro-elastic stress changes depend highly on the fault transmissibility. Results are presented for three fault categories: open intra-reservoir, (partly) sealing intra-reservoir and boundary. Important input are the reservoir stress paths, which are analytically estimated for simple geometries suggested in Appendix B. The induced shear stress profiles are developed based on the analysis of vertical displacement profiles from either side of the fault plane, derived under the assumption of cylindrical-shaped, homogeneous reservoirs. These induced shear stresses are written in terms of the driving stress and two dimensionless geometrical functions. The driving stress has been related to both the reservoir compaction or to the pressure depletion and its magnitude was shown to be equal to the depletion-induced horizontal stress change under uni-axial strain boundary condition, which can be in the same order of magnitude as the poro-elastic stress changes. It is concluded that the induced shear stress has the potential to significantly influence the fault reactivation depletion pressure. However, the total shear stress is the result of the sum of the contributions from and the induced shear stress and the poro-elastic stresses, both strongly depending on the dip of the fault.\nThe applied methodology resulted in a criterium for fault re-activation expressed in terms of a critical reservoir depletion pressure. Also, a fault instability criterion has been derived in term of the friction coefficient and stress paths (Eq. (43)), which can be used to determine whether or not there is a hazard for fault re-activation during reservoir depletion. Practical application requires knowledge of the fault dip, the poro-elastic stress paths, the induced shear stress path and the friction coefficient. The criterion has conveniently been re-written in terms of critical friction angles for specific fault dip angles. Bourne and Oates\n27\n also found frictional stress path criteria by assuming uniaxial strain and small variations thereof but neglecting the vertical stress path. Analysis of re-activation of open intra-reservoir faults showed that the controlling parameter for differential compaction is the normalized fault throw. With increasing normalized throw both the induced shear stress as well as the critical angle increase. For faults steeper than the critical dip the critical re-activation depletion pressure decreases. An additional finding is that the Biot-effect can cause slip-controlled post-failure weakening. Analysis of (partly) sealing intra-reservoir faults showed that increasing the depletion ratio over the fault plane changes the poro-elastic stresses as well as the induced shear stress. As the depletion ratio decreases, the induced shear stress increases and the critical angle increases, but the critical re-activation depletion pressure also increases. This is an unexpected result, since for (partly) sealing fault it was expected that both the poro-elastic stressing as well as the induced shear stress would increase. However, the poro-elastic stress analysis shows that for (partly) sealing faults the depletion-induced horizontal and vertical stress changes are reduced compared to those of the open faults (or the reservoir as a whole). Although both mechanisms cause an increase in the Coulomb stress, the combined effect nevertheless results in an increase of the critical reservoir depletion pressure with increasing differential depletion ratio. Analysis of re-activation of boundary faults showed that the induced shear stress is at its maximum and can be a significant fraction of the driving stress, especially for thin and wide reservoirs having high values for the geometrical functions rc and f\n3. Nevertheless, the results also show that the (non-rotated) critical-oriented faults are nearly impossible to re-activate and also that vertical faults are prone to re-activation. The poro-elastic stress changes are half of those at the open, intra-reservoir faults and as a consequence, the boundary faults tolerate larger pressure depletions before they have a hazard for re-activation.\nOf the three differential compaction mechanisms investigated, only the fault throw leads to a reduction of the critical depletion pressure. The cases of (partly) sealing faults and boundary faults lead unexpectedly to an increase of the critical depletion pressure. These results seem to contradict the conclusion of van Wees et al.\n24\n who stated that at the edge of the reservoir the strongest destabilization occurs. However, most observed seismicity in the Dutch gasfields has been attributed to centrally located intra-reservoir faults and not to boundary faults. Satisfying this mechanical Coulomb criterion for mechanical fault re-activation is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for seismicity to occur, since the rupture can also occur a-seismically. These results can be used to determine the necessary initiation depletion pressures for seismicity to occur in depleting gas reservoirs in the Netherlands. Also a methodology has been shown to determine the maximum seismic moment magnitude based on compaction-induced differential displacements and the fault dip. For the Groningen gas field many major tremors have been attributed to faults having a dip angle between 75 and 80\u00b0,\n51\n which is significantly higher than the critical dip of around 60\u00b0. The fault characterization performed by Kortekaas and Jaarsma\n32\n for the entire field resulted in average dip angles ranging from 60\u00b0 to vertical, with the majority of dips between 74 and 81\u00b0. The presented results demonstrate that all differential compaction mechanisms (fault throw, differential depletion for (partly) sealing faults and boundary faults) result in a stress rotation, which in turn cause an increase in the critical fault dip towards vertical. For the Groningen gas reservoir, it seems plausible that the abundant presence of these fault geometries has facilitated the extensively observed intra-reservoir seismicity\n52\n attributed to relatively steeply dipping fault planes.\n32\n\n\n\n","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\nBackground\nCoupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in the deep subsurface refer to processes in geological formations at a depth of a few hundred meters or more, under the joint influence of thermal gradients, hydraulic pressure changes, rock mechanical stresses and geochemical reactions. Processes that occur include heat transfer and temperature variations, liquid and gas flows, rock mechanical deformation and fracturing, and chemical sorption, dissolution and precipitation. The term \u201ccoupled processes\u201d implies that each process potentially affects and is affected by the initiation and progress of the other processes.\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n Thus, the response of a rock mass cannot be predicted with confidence by considering each process individually or in direct succession. In the field of rock mechanics and rock engineering, many studies have been made on binary couplings between TM and HM processes, but for a number of major geoengineering endeavors, it is essential to understand and be able to model processes with THM coupling, and even full THMC coupling.\nThe present paper provides an overview of a long-term international research collaboration for advancing the understanding and modeling of coupled THMC processes in geological systems. The international collaboration, now running for over 25 years, is the DECOVALEX Project. It was initially motivated by the recognition that prediction of these coupled effects on potential transport of radionuclides from a subsurface repository of heat-releasing radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel is an essential element of the performance and safety assessment of such a disposal system. But, later, it was realized that such coupled effects also play a critical role in a range of other sub-surface engineering activities, such as geological storage of carbon dioxide, creation and exploration of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), and unconventional oil and gas production through hydraulic fracturing.\nSociety has imposed special demands on the safety assessment of geological disposal of radioactive waste not commonly encountered in geoengineering projects. Firstly, the time frame of prediction required in safety assessment typically reaches into hundreds of thousands of years and more. Secondly the evaluation of potential migration of radionuclides must consider very low concentration levels to conform to stringent international regulatory dose limits. Thirdly, a sufficient understanding of the key processes and their effects must be attained in order to provide confidence in the safety assessment.\n3\u20135\n\n\nTHMC processes have a critical input into the confidence building required to underpin safety assessments for most radioactive waste disposal concepts. Elements of demonstration of safety (often referred to as \u2018safety functions\u2019) can have very different constraints in terms of modeling requirements, evaluation confidence, and timescales. Numerical modeling of these safety functions can range from long-term whole-system type analyses for time periods of up to one million year (for example the performance assessment modeling of radionuclide transport from the repository to the biosphere to calculate dose\/exposure) to detailed analyses of specific perturbations within a disposal facility which often occur during the first hundreds to thousands of years after repository construction (such as evaluation of excavation damage zone and changes in permeability, modeling of the early thermal transient and induced coupled processes, evaluation of seal performance etc.). Modeling laboratory and field experiments at different scales can help build confidence in process understanding to support long-term safety evaluations in general, but is considered particularly useful to answer key \u2018questions\u2019 posed by specific safety functions (and related impacts from early-time perturbations) via numerical prediction compared directly with experimental observation. Blind prediction of experimental outcomes can be the most powerful demonstration of confidence for a given aspect of a disposal facility or set of relevant coupled processes, but is also the most difficult logistically and practicality, given the incomplete constraints on even simple experiments. Evaluation of the limited effects of such incomplete constraints can probably be considered as part of the confidence demonstration.\nIt was with this background that the need for improving our understanding and modeling of coupled THM and THMC processes was recognized and the DECOVALEX Project was initiated.\n\n\n1.2\nModeling THMC processes: approaches, complexities, and uncertainties\nFor the performance assessment of a radioactive waste repository, model analyses of coupled THMC effects has to account for, either implicitly or explicitly, heat release from the waste, rock mechanical changes due to repository excavation, as well as changes in water pressure and chemical reactions that affect water and gas flow paths and contaminant transport characteristics (Fig. 1\n). Many of the modelled processes are non-linear and the constitutive relationships between them are not well known. Often alternative constitutive relationships exist, with the different alternatives suitable for different geological settings. However, details of the geological settings and site characteristics cannot be known completely due to practical limitations on site observations and field tests. The appropriate level of necessary site measurements is a question which modeling is often asked to help to answer, and regions of the site where measurements are sparse would have to be represented by some average or representative characteristics. Thus, coupled THMC modeling of geological processes is a complex and challenging task.\nNot all coupled processes occurring in a geological formation need to be represented explicitly in a simulation model. Some may have small impacts even for predictions into thousands of years and can be ignored. Others may be \u201clumped\u201d with one another by the use of effective parameters. What are the major coupled THMC processes to include and what effective parameters can be employed in a simulation model depend on the specific safety criteria, scenarios and site characteristics.\nAs can be seen from the discussion above, there are many choices research groups have to make in performing modeling studies of coupled THMC processes, such as selection of processes to be included, choice of constitutive relationships, representation of areas with sparse data, definition of boundary conditions and model properties, and use of alternative numerical techniques. Model comparison studies by multiple research groups using different approaches are very useful for understanding the uncertainties arising from such conceptual model choices. In this context, a method of evaluating the confidence level of model outcomes needs to be developed.\nThe uncertainty arising from conceptual model approaches is not unique to radioactive waste repository performance assessment. It is also found, for example, in the field of geological carbon storage, where it is important to understand the underlying physical and chemical processes that control the movement of CO2 in the subsurface. Mukhopadhyay et al.\n6\n point out that, while building conceptual models for these complex and often coupled processes, modelers make various choices regarding implementation of multiphase behavior of the fluids and their equations of state, approaches for coupling of processes, modeling techniques, and selection\/interpretation of site characterization and monitoring data. These model choices often lead to a wide range in system evolution, even if each of the models is considering the same operation scenario at the same CO2 storage site. This may be termed as model uncertainty, which is one of the greatest sources of uncertainty and risk for predictive modeling.\n7\n\n\nThe various sources of uncertainty lead to the realization of the crucial role of validating model results against laboratory and field data. In the field of radioactive waste repository safety assessment, many laboratory experiments have been designed and carried out using small core samples as well as large rock samples with sizes up to about 1\u202fm in diameter. Field measurements and field tests are also conducted on experimental sites, some of which in locations where repositories have been proposed to be situated and others in suitable areas with representative geologic conditions. A number of underground research laboratories (URL) have been constructed in major countries as specific dedicated facilities to conduct tests to investigate various concepts, study processes and check modeling results,\n9\n often at the spatial scale envisioned for the ultimate waste emplacement in subsurface tunnels. Experimental work, be it in the laboratory or in the field, is mainly conducted for a particular scenario under particular well-defined driving forces such as changes in stress, pressure or temperature gradients. Numerical simulations with different modeling approaches are then performed to test particular aspects in the capability of the model against measured data, which if successful provides confidence in the evaluations made for safety and performance assessments. The goal is not only to improve model approaches and increase model confidence, but also to allow an estimate of uncertainty ranges. It is to be noted that acquiring the necessary field data\u2014in underground research facilities or other field measurement campaigns\u2014is typically a major multi-year undertaking which requires major national financial resources.\n10\n\n,\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n1.3\nThe DECOVALEX project\nRecognizing the need for a deeper understanding of coupled THM and THMC processes and development of modeling techniques, as well as the importance of model comparison and testing against laboratory and field data by multiple teams using multiple approaches to estimate uncertainty ranges and to enhance confidence of model results, the DECOVALEX Project was initiated in 1992 (www.decovalex.org). It is an international cooperative project of primarily nuclear waste management organizations, including implementers, regulators, and research institutes involved in national programs (from Switzerland, Japan, Canada, France, Czech Republic, Sweden, United Kingdom, Finland, China, Korea, Germany, Spain, Taiwan and the United States), plus a large number of associated modeling teams. Under this project, the research teams have been able to share and study data from major and expensive laboratory and field experiments. In-depth and detailed discussions among the teams have yielded insight into the coupled THMC processes and have stimulated development of modeling capabilities and measurement methods which would not have been possible if the data had been studied by only one or two groups.\nSince the project initiation, the project has been operating in several four-year phases, each phase featuring a small number (typically three to seven) modeling tasks of importance to radioactive waste disposal, together covering a large number of theoretical, numerical, laboratory and field studies. Six project phases were successfully concluded between 1992 and 2015, results of which have been summarized in several overview publications\n12\u201314\n and described in detail in a series of Special Issues in the International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences (Vol. 32 (5) in 1995, Vol. 38 (1) in 2001, and Vol. 42 (5\u20136) in 2005), in the Journal of Environmental Geology (Vol. 57 (6) in 2009), in the Journal of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (Vol. 5 (1\u20132), in 2013), and in a 2018 Topical Collection \u201cDECOVALEX-2015\u201d in the Journal of Environmental Earth Sciences. The current phase, named DECOVALEX-2019, runs from 2016 through 2019. Over the past two and a half decades, during which the project has made significant advances in modeling THM and THMC, its main objectives have not changed:\n\n\u2022\nTo support development of numerical simulators for THM and THMC processes in geological systems\n\n\n\u2022\nTo investigate and implement suitable algorithms for THM and THMC modeling\n\n\n\u2022\nTo compare model calculations with results from field and laboratory experiments\n\n\n\u2022\nTo design new experiments to support code and model development\n\n\n\u2022\nTo study the application of THM and THMC modeling to performance and safety assessment of nuclear waste repositories\n\n\n\nOne of the most important characteristics of DECOVALEX is the emphasis on in-depth interaction between the research teams and on a cooperative supportive environment. Scientific workshops are held twice per year, and task-specific discussions may be held in between. At the workshops, detailed discussions allow for efficient exchange of information and sharing of scientific knowledge. Through comparisons of results from the research teams, much insight is gained, not only on the effects of coupled processes, but also on the strengths, weaknesses, and adequacies of the various approaches and computer codes. It is also an effective way for participants to learn from each other and for new research teams, graduate students and early-career researchers to get up to speed on the state of art in this research field.\n\n\n\n2\nDECOVALEX setup and activities\nFrom the onset, the organization for the DECOVALEX Project was set up as simple and as effective as possible. The project consists of a number of organizations from different countries, called the funding organizations, who jointly support the project (for a given four-year project phase) and provide funding to their own research team (or teams) working on the tasks defined in the project. Representatives from the funding organizations form a Steering Committee to direct all project activities. The Steering Committee is assisted by one selected funding organization for managing all administrative matters (the managing participant), a chairman for providing general scientific direction and guidance in defining project tasks, and a technical coordinator for handling all technical and reporting matters. Through the Steering Committee and close communication among the managing participant, committee chairman and technical coordinator, the project can be run in a very efficient and flexible way. This is demonstrated by the fact that DECOVALEX has been successful to continue phase after phase over the last 25+\u00a0years. Appendix A shows a list of funding organizations and research teams over the project phases from 1992 to today.\nAt the start of the project in 1992, the Steering Committee decided to define the project activities as studying a number of benchmark tests (BMT) and test cases (TC) of importance to radioactive waste disposal and other subsurface engineering applications. The BMTs investigate hypothetical problems in the behavior of individual or multiple coupled THM and THMC processes, and in some cases analyze the extrapolation of results over the large temporal and spatial scales of interest to repository performance. The TCs are actual laboratory and field experiments studied and modelled to advance our understanding of the THM and THMC processes based on measured data. This dual-prong strategy has been followed throughout the duration of the project to date. A number of large-scale, multiyear field experiments have been analyzed within the project, such as the Kamaishi THM Experiment, the FEBEX experiment in Grimsel underground research laboratory, and the Yucca Mountain drift scale heater test (DST) which was at a site proposed for a repository at that time. Appendix B shows a list of major BMTs and TCs which have been studied over the project phases from 1992 to today.\nBMTs and TCs are collectively modelled by DECOVALEX participants. As modeling teams provide their individual results for the same modeling challenge, comparative assessment can assist both to interpret and understand the experimental results and to test the simulation models used. While code verification and benchmarking efforts have been undertaken elsewhere to test simulation codes,\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n the model comparison conducted within the DECOVALEX framework is different because (a) the modeling tasks are often actual laboratory and field experiments, and (b) DECOVALEX engages model comparison in a broad and comprehensive sense, including the modelers' interpretation of experimental data, selection of boundary conditions, rock and fluid properties, etc., in addition to their choice of coupling schemes and simulators. Based on the results from such broad model comparison, key data needs can be identified, new model capability developments may be undertaken and new experiments be proposed to advance the state of mathematical modeling for coupled processes in geological systems.\n\n\n3\nProject progression through successive DECOVALEX phases\nOne of the principles of DECOVALEX is that in each project phase the portfolio of modeling tasks is defined collectively by project participants, in a process where TC's and BMT's proposed by some funding organizations are selected based on the interest of other project partners to engage in them as a participating modeling team. Thus, the tasks selected over the 25 years of DECOVALEX existence mimic closely the broader evolution of the scientific issues of importance in the field of radioactive waste disposal. We provide below a brief review of these trends\u2014in terms of host rock preference, emphasis of engineered versus natural barrier, importance of various coupled processes, spatial and temporal scale, as well as numerical methods used\u2014and in Sections 4 and 5 illustrate these further by giving summaries of several selected DECOVALEX tasks.\n\n3.1\nKey processes, repository stages, and host rock characteristics\nTo provide a general framework for discussing coupled processes and their relevance, it may be worthwhile to introduce distinct periods in the development of a geological repository for radioactive waste (see Fig. 2\n). Tsang et al.\n17\n contrasted the key processes and issues in early repository implementation phases (Construction and Open Drift Stage) with those occurring during a period of thermal disturbance after waste emplacement (Exploitation Stage) and during a long-term period where much of the early perturbations are starting to subside and the system is approaching a late time equilibrium (Long-Term Post-Closure Stage).\nKey processes in the early stages of repository development are the potential creation of an excavation damaged zone (EDZ) of increased permeability around the tunnels. Performance assessment requires knowledge about how EDZ properties evolve over time and, in the case of clay repositories, how they may be affected by tunnel ventilation and saturation changes. During the Exploitation Stage, decay heat from radioactive waste may generate large temperature increases in the buffer and the near-field rock, while at the same time resaturation of the near field occurs as a slow process governed by relatively low rock permeability and buffer characteristics. Heating may lead to water vapor convection near the heat sources and generate transient pore-pressure buildup resulting from differential thermal expansion, leading to changes in effective stress state in the engineered and natural barrier system. Heating may also affect important rock properties such as rock strength, and may induce chemical reactions with impact on rock properties.\nThe Long-Term Post-Closure Stage is the basic period of concern for long-term performance and safety assessment because it is the most likely stage when failure of the engineered barriers may occur and lead to the release and subsequent transport of radionuclides and any non-radioactive contaminants. The transport characteristics in the tunnel backfill and near-field rock during this period depend strongly on the coupled processes and effects that occurred during the previous stages. In addition, there are some long-term coupled processes during this stage that can potentially affect radionuclide migration, such as geochemical processes or gas production from the degradation of repository engineering materials. And finally, this long-term period is also concerned with radionuclide transport in the rock mass away from the repository, which is strongly affected by the host rock characteristics and heterogeneities as well as coupled THMC processes associated long-term climate variations.\nOver the 25 years, the DECOVALEX Project has tackled a variety of the key processes mentioned above, with an emphasis on the perturbations occurring during the earlier repository stages, and it has done so for most of the major rock types considered for hosting geologic repositories (crystalline rock, sedimentary rock, indurated clays, plastic clays, and rock salt). While there are considerable differences between rock types with regards to the key processes affecting repository safety, there are also many similarities, and the concepts, experimental approaches, and numerical models are often transferable.\n19\n Within DECOVALEX phases, the consideration of key processes has often been done simultaneously for a variety of rock types, which in turn have helped provide deeper insight and higher confidence in our understanding of any one particular rock type of interest.\n\n\n3.2\nDECOVALEX evolution through 25\u202fyears\nThis section gives a brief review of research highlights illustrating the philosophy of the DECOVALEX Project and some major trends observed over the course of 25 years. Fig. 3\n places five modeling tasks, each selected as examples for the scientific evolution of the project, onto a DECOVALEX timeline from 1992 to 2017.\nIn 1992 when DECOVALEX was founded and in the following decade, many nuclear-energy nations worldwide focused on hard competent crystalline rock like granite to host a waste repository.\n20\n\n,\n\n21\n Most of these countries participated in DECOVALEX as partner organizations (e.g., France, Canada, Spain, Japan, United Kingdom, Sweden, and Finland). It is therefore no surprise that many of the test cases and benchmark tests during the first three phases of DECOVALEX (I, II and III) addressed coupled THM processes in crystalline rock with focus on the multiple fractures in such rocks since the fractures provide the main pathways for flow and solute transport. In a few cases, the role of bentonite backfill as an important engineered barrier in such rocks was also investigated.\nAt the time of these DECOVALEX phases, scientists were just starting to experiment with different conceptual approaches and simulation methods to model thermally-driven coupled flow and mechanics in fractured rock. This is reflected in the task portfolio in DECOVALEX I, which focused on basic process understanding and development of constitutive relationships. Research teams worked on (1) three benchmark tests comparing a range of simulation approaches for HM and THM processes in well-defined fracture-matrix systems, (2) three small laboratory experiments to improve fundamental relationships between the permeability of fractures and shear versus confining pressure, and (3) two small-scale field tests addressing the role of coupled hydro-mechanical processes. One of the benchmark tests from DECOVALEX I, BMT3, is further described in Section 4.1 as a good example of a synthetic task testing the capabilities of many alternative conceptual models and computer codes. The task features a representative emplacement design with a tunnel and heated deposition hole embedded in a fractured crystalline host rock system with thousands of explicitly defined fractures. The modeling teams used a range of approaches ranging from continuum to hybrid to discrete fracture methods to simulate the THM processes occurring during excavation and waste emplacement, collectively providing a much clearer understanding of conceptual model uncertainties arising from the use of different constitutive relationships, homogenization techniques, degrees of simplification, and numerical solution methods.\nThe progression from DECOVALEX I to DECOVALEX II and III corresponds to continuing advances in the research field of coupled THM process modeling. While DECOVALEX I represented an initial stage of such research investigation involving a number of laboratory and small-scale field investigations, DECOVALEX II focused on comprehensive studies of two field tests in Japan and in the United Kingdom. The trend to larger and more complex field studies continued in DECOVALEX III, which was motivated by two of the most important multi-year thermal experiments available to date, the Full-scale Engineered Barrier Experiment (FEBEX) with bentonite-backfilled tunnels in crystalline rock at the Grimsel Test Site in Switzerland and the Drift Scale Test with an open-drift concept in volcanic tuff at Yucca Mountain in the United States. Both experiments were full-scale realistic representations of a waste emplacement tunnel featuring the repository concepts envisioned in the mid 90's by the Spanish and the U.S. programs. Modeling teams involved in either experiment gained an integrated perspective of the behavior of disposal concepts in fractured crystalline rock and fractured volcanic tuff. The monitoring data provided to the teams proved invaluable for verifying, validating and studying the capabilities of a number of numerical codes held by the DECOVALEX III project teams. More detail on the FEBEX test is given in Section 4.2.\nIn 2004, the progression into its fourth phase, referred to as DECOVALEX-THMC, marked an important refocusing and expansion of the collaborative research project, in terms of processes addressed and host rocks studied. DECOVALEX-THMC involved a first push to adding chemistry (or \u201cC\u201d) to the primarily THM coupling in previous phases. One modeling task looked into the impact of temperature-induced precipitation and dissolution on the porosity and permeability of the host rock in the near field of a repository, in volcanic and crystalline-bentonite systems. At the same time, DECOVALEX-THMC moved beyond the crystalline rock cases in response to some major nuclear energy nations starting to research disposal in argillaceous clays (e.g., France, Switzerland,\n22\n), and for the first time DECOVALEX included a test case featuring a rock characterization experiment in an argillite URL (the Tournemire site in France). This phase thus investigated three alternative rock types simultaneously, crystalline rock, volcanic tuff and argillaceous clay. It is also worth noting that four of the five DECOVALEX-THMC tasks were related to coupled phenomena in the near-field, and in particular the processes defining the creation and evolution of excavation damaged zones (EDZ).\nMoving into DECOVALEX-2011, the fifth project phase from 2008 through 2011, we see a continuing trend with increasing emphasis on argillite host rocks and coupled chemical reactions. For example, Task A of DECOVALEX-2011 featured a large-scale experiment conducted from 2002 through 2006 in a 10\u202fm long micro-tunnel at the Mont Terri URL in Switzerland referred to as Ventilation Experiment, or VE. This experiment examined the hydro-mechanical and chemical changes that may occur in argillaceous host rocks, especially in relation to the coupling with the ventilation of drifts and the cyclic desaturation of the near-drift host rock (see details in Section 4.3). At the same time, several DECOVALEX partner organizations maintained their focus on crystalline disposal environments, which explains the continuing study of emerging research issues relevant to crystalline rocks within the task portfolio.\nDECOVALEX-2015 is the most recent phase that was fully completed at the time of writing this article. Chemical processes are now ingrained in many of the tasks conducted. A prime example is Task C1, which pushed the state of the art of modeling the fully coupled THMC interactions occurring in a single rock fracture exposed to fluid flow and reactions, heat, and confining stress (see Section 4.4). This sixth project phase also saw an increasing emphasis on buffer and sealing materials and their system performance in conjunction with the natural barrier. For example, two heater test tasks, based on large-scale experiments in the Mont Terri URL Switzerland and in the Horonobe URL, Japan respectively, explored the THM and THMC processes occurring in disposal tunnels with bentonite backfill embedded in a clay or mudstone host rock. In addition, the SEALEX Experiment in the Tournemire URL studied the barrier performance of the tunnel seals required in geologic repositories and how these are affected by HM couplings during bentonite hydration and swelling (Section 4.5). As a good example of a task structured into a sequence of simple to complex modeling steps, research teams were asked to work through preparatory steps of increasing complexity, starting with the simulation of laboratory and mock-up tests and separate responses of seal material versus host rock, before focusing on the integrated system behavior of the in-situ SEALEX Experiment.\nCurrently, the DECOVALEX Project is in the middle of its seventh phase, referred to as DECOVALEX-2019. The characteristics and trends that have shaped the first six phases are reflected in the current task portfolio, this time featuring a record number of tasks (seven) and a near-record number of funding organizations (13). In the task list in Appendix B, we see that this phase includes even coupling to biological processes. We also see not only a balance between different host rocks as well as between engineered and natural barriers involving a broad range of scales both in space and time, but also a mix of fundamental research tackling the basic understanding of complex processes versus more applied tasks looking into integrated behavior of disposal systems and sub-systems.\nTo provide a brief overview of on-going activities, we have selected three representative DECOVALEX-2019 tasks in Section 5 where more detail is provided. The first task explores an emerging concern in the nuclear waste community about gases produced from the corrosion of engineered barrier materials and whether, in low-permeability elastoplastic materials such as bentonite and clay, they can move away from their source without creating overpressure and rock damage (Section 5.1). The second task is about progressive upscaling of THM processes from core experiments in the laboratory to small-scale field experiments (some cubic meters) to real scale disposal systems (entire tunnel segments) and to the scale of an entire waste repository (cubic kilometers) (Section 5.2). The third task addresses important issues related to the potential creation of flow paths for contaminant transport in otherwise low permeability argillaceous rocks (Section 5.3). Such flow paths could be created by reactivating faults of various sizes by thermal, hydraulic or mechanical disturbance during the operational and post-closure stages of a repository. The modeling challenge is based on a recent fault activation experiment performed at the Mont Terri URL, featuring controlled fluid injection directly into different fault compartments and measuring the hydromechanical response as a function of time.\nIt is interesting to note that all three tasks described in Section 5 are relevant beyond just radioactive waste disposal, meaning that experience gained through them is of direct relevance to other subsurface engineering applications such as geologic carbon sequestration, geothermal energy production, unconventional oil and gas production, waste water disposal, energy storage and gas storage. The DECOVALEX Project recently felt that there might be an opportunity for mutual benefit by bringing broader subsurface science expertise to bear on these data sets. As a first step in this direction, the Steering Committee decided to open up the fault reactivation task by inviting participation from organizations not traditionally part of DECOVALEX or the radioactive waste disposal science community.\n\n\n\n4\nExample tasks and lessons learned\nHere we present selected examples of past modeling tasks conducted within the DECOVALEX Project, together conveying the topical breadth of the activities as well as the unique characteristic of in-depth collaboration between international researchers of different disciplines using a range of different approaches.\n\n4.1\nBenchmark test 3 (DECOVALEX I)\nBenchmark Test 3 (BMT3) was conducted during the first DECOVALEX phase and became one of the \u201cclassical\u201d DECOVALEX tasks, a good example for testing collaboratively the capabilities of many alternative models and computer codes.\n23\n The problem is associated with a near-field repository model, set up as a two-dimensional plane-strain problem in which a tunnel with a deposition hole is located in a fractured rock mass. The model domain is a 50\u202fm by 50\u202fm vertical cross section, situated 500\u202fm below ground level (Fig. 4\na). The modeling task is set up as a fully coupled THM near-field repository problem, with thermal effects caused by heat released from radioactive waste in the deposition hole (the heater). Heat output decreases exponentially with time. The crystalline rock mass surrounding the hole features a dense fracture network with a two-dimensional realization of 6580 fractures, built from a realistic three-dimensional fracture network model of the Stripa Mine, Sweden. The rock matrix is assumed to be isotropic and linearly elastic, with mechanical properties assumed independent of temperature variations, and thermal conductivity and expansion. The fractures are defined as parallel, planar, smooth surfaces with an effective hydraulic aperture. The initial and boundary conditions for the mechanical, thermal, and hydraulic effects are shown in Fig. 4a, with heating maintained for 100 years.\nThree modeling stages were simulated in BMT3, see Fig. 4b. Stage 1 is the loading of the computational model prior to excavation of the tunnel under initial and boundary conditions of hydro-mechanical effects. An initial hydro-mechanical equilibrium should be achieved at the end of this loading stage. Stage 2 is the excavation of the tunnel, executed at the end of Stage 1. The initial hydro-mechanical equilibrium is disturbed and a new HM equilibrium should be achieved at the end of this stage, denoted as time t\u00a0=\u00a0t*. Stage 3 begins the thermal loading, starting at time t\u00a0=\u00a0t* and maintained for 100 years.\nThe problem was studied by eight research teams. Fig. 5\n shows the different representations and simplifications in the models used by the various teams. The studies produced insight not only into the effects of coupled THM processes, but also into the uncertainty and confidence levels of numerical simulations of these processes. As representative examples of the results obtained, Fig. 6\n shows distributions of the stress (horizontal component) and temperature along a vertical profile cutting through the tunnel center, and Fig. 7\n shows the water flux into the tunnel across its perimeter, produced by multiple research teams using different methods. It is clearly shown that the agreement on the temperature distribution is very good, and also fairly good for stresses, using either continuum or discrete methods. However, great discrepancy is observed for water in flux into the tunnel. The dominant reason for this discrepancy is the impact of alternative assumptions of fracture connectivity and how it relates to the macroscopic permeability in fractured crystalline rocks, an important lesson learned for the following phases of DECOVALEX research.\n\n\n4.2\nFEBEX full-scale heater test (DECOVALEX III)\nThe international FEBEX heater test\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n was a major modeling task in DECOVALEX III. The FEBEX project was conducted by ENRESA, Spain, with financial support from the European Commission. ENRESA provided to DECOVALEX modeling teams a vast data set covering the first three years of the heating period.\nThe FEBEX tunnel was excavated in the granite rock at the Grimsel Test Site (Fig. 8\n), an underground laboratory in Switzerland, operated by the Swiss waste management organization NAGRA. The experiment was based on the Spanish reference concept of deep geological storage in crystalline host rock, in which steel canisters containing conditioned waste are placed along the axis of horizontal galleries, and an engineered barrier of bentonite is placed in the annular space between them. In the FEBEX in situ test, the waste canisters were represented by two cylindrical heaters.\nAfter emplacement of heaters and bentonite blocks and start of the first heating phase in 1997, water began flowing from the granite host rock towards the bentonite, which initially had low saturation. Because the thermal and the hydraulic gradient are in opposite directions, the flow of water and the transport of heat occurred in opposite directions. The thermal gradient caused diffusive vapor transport away from the heater while capillary forces caused water to flow towards the heater. The resulting change in water content led to bentonite shrinkage on the hot dry side (near the heater) and swelling on the cooler wet side (near the bentonite-rock interface), which in turn led to local changes in the stress state of the bentonite and the host rock.\nA modeling exercise aimed at predicting the heater test behavior was divided into three parts. In Part A, predictions for both the total water inflow to the tunnel, as well as the water pressure change induced by the boring of the tunnel, were required from the research teams. Part B required predictions of local field variables\u2014such as temperature, relative humidity, stress, and displacement\u2014at selected points in the bentonite barrier. Part C asked for predictions of temperature, stress, water pressure, and displacement at selected points in the host rock. Altogether, ten research teams performed modeling of the test.\nReasonably good agreement was obtained between the predictions and measured results on almost all comparison variables with the coupling mechanisms properly considered in numerical models, especially when the models were calibrated with measured data. Predicting the behavior of the buffer under the combined heating and wetting actions requires a fully coupled THM formulation, which incorporates all the necessary physical processes controlling the bentonite behavior. Only a partial set of codes could offer the required features. The heating of the rock resulted in a significant increase in rock stresses in the vicinity of the FEBEX tunnel. However, water pressures remained essentially unchanged. The relatively high rock permeability explains the absence of significant pore-water pressure transients. Only one of the participating modeling teams was capable of achieving a consistent prediction of all the measured variables in the rock: temperature, water pressure, rock stress, and radial displacement.\nParticularly relevant to predicting the early stages of heating was the inclusion of vapor transport as well as accounting for water phase changes. Codes incorporating these features were capable of making good predictions. It should be added that the FEBEX in situ test benefits from comprehensive experimental information on compacted bentonite properties, derived from a large variety of laboratory tests on samples and on small-scale hydration and heating cells.\nModeling the FEBEX experiment was a progressive learning process for the teams, a process involving blind prediction and calibration cycles. Some of the physical explanations found for specific measurements (e.g. the development of pore water pressures in the granite when the FEBEX tunnel was excavated) and the progressive improvement of THM codes were highlights of this process. It turned out that a true \u201cblind\u201d prediction was difficult to make even if a highly controlled and documented case (such as FEBEX) was chosen for comparison exercises; nonetheless, such blind comparisons continue to be attempted in the DECOVALEX Project as it is the best test of a model's predictive capabilities, if hard to perform in practice. As predictive modeling improves with the release of additional data, whether or not the relevant coupling mechanisms are properly considered in modeling the FEBEX experiment is a key issue. These mechanisms may or may not be readily identified at the early stage of modeling but can be realized with continued cooperative investigations among the teams.\nThe DECOVALEX study of the FEBEX experiment represented a major advance in knowledge of the coupled processes in a rock-bentonite-heater system, for all the project participants as well as the broader scientific community. The detailed comparisons of model results with measured data led to new insights into physical explanations for specific measurements (such as the evolution of pore-water pressures in the granite when the FEBEX tunnel was being excavated). More detailed descriptions of the work and achievements, and outstanding issues, can be found in Refs. \n25\u201327\n\n\nIt is worth noting that in 2002, after about 5 years of heating, a partial dismantling and sampling of the bentonite was carried out (FEBEX II), removing Heater 1 and much of the associated bentonite buffer. Heater 2 on the other hand kept operating for another 13 years, which makes FEBEX the longest running experiment of its scale. In August 2015, the FEBEX-DP project completed dismantling and sampling of Heater 2 and associated bentonite. One of the tasks in the current DECOVALEX-2019 phase revisits the FEBEX experiment and studies the new data, with a particular focus on bentonite heterogeneity evolution, attempting to build on much of the work that was performed in DECOVALEX III.\n\n\n4.3\nVentilation experiment in Opalinus Clay (DECOVALEX-2011)\nThe Mont Terri URL is located near a security gallery of a motorway tunnel in northern Switzerland.\n28\n It is at a depth of about 400\u202fm in Opalinus Clay, which is a stiff layered Mesozoic clay of marine origin. After the excavation of niches in 1996, a new gallery was excavated in 1998, followed by a micro-tunnel of 1.3\u202fm in diameter in early 1999. The ventilation experiment (VE) took place in a sealed 10\u202fm long section of this micro-tunnel (Fig. 9\n). The experiment consisted of hydraulically \u201cstressing\u201d the host rock by blowing high and low relative humidity air through the sealed section and observing the hydro-mechanical-chemical response.\n29\n This controlled period lasted approximately 4 years until the end of 2006 and was intended to provoke the kind of extreme humidity conditions that might occur during the repository construction process. By being able to model the complex hydro-mechanical-chemical interactions during this period it was intended that confidence could be built in models to predict the condition of tunnels prior to waste emplacement.\nThe VE modeling task (part of DECOVALEX-2011) involved building research team expertise through modeling a laboratory drying experiment\n29\n\n,\n\n30\n and then progressing onto the field experiment in a piece-wise manner, first considering the hydro-mechanical, then non-reactive, and finally reactive geochemical observations. A key requirement of the task specification was a blind prediction of the hydro-mechanical response. This was particularly challenging because evidence from the tunnel showed that the airflow was not sufficiently high to ensure that the applied relative humidity was uniform throughout the tunnel.\n30\n Therefore, for a genuine prediction, a physics-based representation of the interaction between the tunnel air, injector and host rock was required. Teams adopted different approaches, ranging from calibrated empirical methods to fully coupled abstracted representations of air and vapor migration in the tunnel.\n30\n It was not found necessary to resort to full CFD (computational fluid dynamics) analysis of airflow in the tunnel, because classical dimensionless analysis indicated simple air flow conditions were likely to dominate. In all cases, good hydro-mechanical responses were obtained by the teams (Figs. 10 and 11\n\n).\nModeling of the chloride build-up close to the tunnel as the result of evaporation in the host rock and at the tunnel surface, with resulting back-diffusion into the host rock, was also well-captured using physically plausible parameterization when including the concept of a distinct chloride porosity (Fig. 12\n). Osmotic water flow effects were not found to be significant in this case and could be safely neglected.\n31\n One team was able to construct a fully-coupled geochemical representation of the tunnel system, including redox effects and produce good calibrations to observed sulphate concentrations into the tunnel wall.\nA key conclusion of this work was that while it was possible to represent the hydro-mechanical evolution of the system without explicit consideration of the water vapor phase (largely by adjusting the water relative permeability functions to give the same net resultant permeability), producing convincing models for the chemical transport component of the analysis was difficult without water vapor. This is not in itself surprising, but it does illustrate that for some modeling applications simplifications can be made to the model formulations if the acceptable bounds of those simplifications are understood, whereas for other applications these simplifications are not acceptable.\n\n\n4.4\nTHMC processes in a single fracture (DECOVALEX-2015)\nAs part of DECOVALEX-2015, a task was conducted to examine the fundamental thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical (THMC) behavior of single fractures at the laboratory scale.\n32\n\n,\n\n33\n The experimental work of Yasuhara et al.\n34\n\n,\n\n35\n was used wherein artificial single fractures in novaculite (one experiment) and granite (three experiments) were subject to a mechanical confining pressure, variable fluid flows, and different applied temperatures. Differential pressures across the samples were measured to determine permeability and hence hydraulic aperture evolution, while at the same time the chemical composition of the outflows was continually sampled (Fig. 13\n). For the novaculite experiments, the topography of the fracture surfaces (Fig. 14\n) was characterized using a high-resolution laser profilometer, and post-experimental characterization of the aperture was performed using a Wood's metal fracture cast. The objective of the modeling task was to increase the fundamental understanding of micro-scale processes near fracture asperities and use this knowledge to predict the long-term permeability evolution of rock fractures in the near field of repository tunnels.\nSix research teams participated in the project and a wide range of numerical approaches was used, including 2D and 3D high resolution coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical (THMC) models. Homogenized \u201csingle compartment\u201d models of the fracture were also applied, in an attempt to upscale the processes so that they could be used in larger fracture network studies or in effective continuum models. Particular attention was given to the competing roles of aqueous geochemistry, pressure solution, stress corrosion and pure mechanics in order to reproduce the experimental observations. The definition of the fracture surfaces (and indirectly, aperture) was a particularly intense area of investigation, with a diverse range of statistical approaches developed and applied.\n32\n\n,\n\n33\n Acknowledging the complexity of some aspects of the modeling, especially the aqueous geochemistry, simple test cases were used throughout the task to build confidence in the outputs of the different simulation stages.\nThe resulting models were all able to replicate the key features of the experiments, including the observed fracture closing and opening for the novaculite test (Fig. 15\n) despite the very different approaches taken by the teams, especially with regards simulating the coupled processes acting on stressed asperity contacts or modeling aqueous geochemistry (Fig. 16\n). A series of open issues were identified from the study. For example, in order to match observations, all the models relied on very large and temperature-dependent increases in some key parameters, most notably the mineral dissolution rates. Furthermore, the models could be adjusted to better reflect the experimental results in a self-consistent manner by enhancing (or excluding) different competing processes, such as stress corrosion and rock-matrix diffusion, and it was not possible to quantitatively distinguish which processes were controlling the observed behavior. This task therefore demonstrated that while self-consistent models of such systems are possible to construct, fundamental uncertainties in the underlying physics and chemistry meant that there is no preferable model or models, and thus there was a clear need for well-designed targeted experiments to isolate the relative contribution of the different identified processes.\n\n\n4.5\nSEALEX experiment (DECOVALEX-2015)\nThe SEALEX experiments comprised a series of field investigations at the Tournemire URL in the south of France.\n36\n Run by the Institute de Radioprotection et de S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nucl\u00e9aire (IRSN), the purpose of the SEALEX experiments was to investigate the performance (in terms of various hydraulic and mechanical properties) of different sealing materials for waste emplacement tunnels during and after the rehydration process. Clay-based swelling core seals were emplaced in 60\u202fcm diameter horizontal deposition holes in the Tournemire argillite, an indurated low-permeability clay. A novel experimental design allowed to impose a constant fluid pressure (or to measure water flux in a later stage) and a watertight seal at both ends of the core seals, provided tight mechanical confinement to ensure a volume-controlled condition along the axial direction during the tests, and featured sophisticated intra-core instrumentation to measure the transient hydro-mechanical (HM) conditions based on wireless instrumentation. The particular experiment for consideration in this task consisted of a seal core made with a 70:30 MX-80 bentonite-sand mixture.\nThe purpose of the SEALEX modeling task was to develop an understanding of the evolution of performance of clay-based sealing systems and to assist in the interpretation of the experimental data. The task sequence followed what is a typical approach for DECOVALEX tasks, working through a sequence of modeling steps of increasing complexity. An initial modeling step involved laboratory tests on samples with a range of bentonite-sand mixture densities, including oedometer tests and a 1D infiltration test. All the research teams successfully developed models that could replicate the key laboratory observations,\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n but there were some key divergences in the approaches used. Constitutive models ranged from direct use of the Barcelona Basic Model for bentonite, to novel models for the plastic response of sealing materials, and finally to relatively simple non-linear elastic models.\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n\n\nThese models were then applied \u201cblind\u201d to a 1\/10th scale SEALEX mockup experiment conducted in the laboratory which included the annular \u201cvoid\u201d which is also present at the field scale (see Fig. 17\n). Blind comparisons were only attempted by one of the six teams but the results were good given various uncertainties in the transition from the other laboratory data, specifically a lack of data at lower clay dry densities.\n38\n The blind prediction gave important insights into the behavior of the constitutive models and was a useful process in the development of the final models. As teams calibrated their models to the 1\/10th scale mockup experiment, considerable variation was seen in the treatment of the annular \u201cvoid\u201d with some teams treating it as a gel of variable stiffness and others using complex boundary conditions coupled with the water inflow rate to approximate the observed behavior. Good calibrated models were obtained in all cases.\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n\n\nThe final modeling step was simulation of the full bentonite core \u201cin situ\u201d experiment. Unlike the 1\/10th mockup experiment, measurements of internal relative humidity and radial stresses were available. The additional data revealed a much more complicated evolution than that shown by the laboratory scale experiments, in part caused by the complex interactions of the seal core with the surrounding host rock and the tunnel access gallery. Considerable effort was placed on interpreting the experiments and obtaining good modeling results in most cases, although stress interpretation remained a challenge (Fig. 18\n).\nIn performing this exercise, a key divergence between teams was seen in the philosophy of calibrating across all the available experiments at different scales. Some teams attempted to adopt a single model that used a common parameterization (frequently with a strong dry density dependence) and hence had a less good experiment-specific fit, while others chose to calibrate specifically to each experiment and compare variation in input parameters between experiments. Both approaches have value, but there was a clear drive from the project to move towards internal self-consistency in the produced models as these are those that will be more robust for wider application and true prediction. Another major discrepancy was seen in the use on non-linear elastic constitutive models versus full plastic models. It was clear that it would not be possible to fit all the experimental data without some element of mechanical plasticity: however, the larger-scale experiments could be calibrated well using simplified representations. This observation reinforces the point that a wide range of different model formulations can be useful in simulating a particular set of experiments, but the domain of their applicability needs to be well-understood if they are to be deployed successfully outside of the data, conditions, or scale to which they have been applied and tested.\n\n\n\n5\nAn overview of ongoing tasks in the DECOVALEX project\nHere we present three ongoing tasks selected from the current DECOVALEX-2019 phase. As the participating modeling teams are in the middle of conducting a comparative assessment of methods and results, we focus here less on describing the detailed approaches and findings; rather, we intend to illustrate the continued relevance of the DECOVALEX approach to tackling important science questions related to the geological disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel as well as other subsurface engineering applications.\n\n5.1\nGas transport in low-permeability clay-based materials\nGas migration in clay-based buffer materials (and clay rocks) has been the subject of a number of international research programs in the field of nuclear waste disposal, including both laboratory scale and in situ experiments.\n39\u201341\n A number of model approaches have been proposed for the analysis of the experimental results and for the prediction of gas release scenarios from geological repositories in the context of long-term safety assessment. However, the predictive capability of the gas transport models is yet limited, indicating that basic mechanisms of gas transport in bentonite are not understood in sufficient detail to provide the ground for robust conceptual and quantitative models.\nIn several repository concepts pursued worldwide, corrosion of metallic materials under anoxic conditions will lead to the formation of hydrogen. Radioactive decay of the waste and radiolysis of water are additional source terms. If the rate of gas produced exceeds the rate of gas transport and dissolution within the pores of the barrier or host rock, a discrete gas phase will form. Gas will continue to accumulate until its pressure becomes sufficiently large for it to enter the surrounding material and migrate away from the waste package, via one of four potential mechanisms as follows (Fig. 19\n): (1) gas movement by dissolution and subsequent diffusion and entrained advection via migration of the solvent fluid; (2) gas flow in the original porosity of the fabric, commonly referred to as visco-capillary (or two-phase) flow; (3) gas flow along localized dilatant pathways, with potential coupling to the local stress field; and (4) gas fracturing of the buffer material or clay rock similar to that performed during hydrocarbon stimulation exercises.\n42\n\n,\n\n43\n\n\nPrevious studies on gas migration in clay-based materials\n39\n\n,\n\n44\n indicate that classic continuum concepts of porous medium two-phase flow may not be adequate, depending on the scale of the processes and resolution of the numerical model. However, the details of the dilatant mechanisms controlling gas entry, flow and pathway sealing are unclear. As such, development of new and novel numerical representations for the quantitative treatment of gas in clay-based repository systems therefore required, a research need at the center of Task A of the ongoing DECOVALEX phase.\n42\n The purpose of this task is to better understand the fundamental processes governing the advective movement of gas in low permeability clay barrier materials.\n42\n Special attention is given to the mechanisms controlling factors such as gas entry and flow, as well as pathway stability and sealing as a function of time, which will impact long-term barrier performance.\nTo perform this task, data sets on pressure, flow rate, and stress measurements from a series of gas flow tests performed on initially saturated samples have been made available to project participants. These long-term tests, performed under carefully controlled laboratory conditions at the British Geological Survey (BGS), provide detailed data with which to examine gas migration behavior under steady state conditions. As such, a number of test geometries have been used, ranging in complexity from relatively simple one-dimensional flow tests on bentonite to triaxial tests performed on natural samples of COx claystone. To gain insights into the movement of gas through these materials, the laboratory data are used to guide and benchmark numerical model development in an iterative process, increasing in model complexity from one test stage to the next.\n42\n\nFig. 20\n shows the pressure vessel used at BGS for monitoring of the evolution of pressure and stress at different locations along of a cylindrical bentonite sample, as well as inflow and outflow rates through filters at both ends of the sample. The first modeling activity in Task A relates to a gas flow test through MX-80 bentonite, with boundary conditions chosen such that the main flow direction is along the axis of the cylinder.\nModeling approaches developed by eight participating modeling teams are tested against the laboratory data, in a staged manner, building up in complexity (both in terms of the experimental and modeling approaches). As the modeling activities are still ongoing, we are not presenting any details on modeling results. Rather, we like to demonstrate here the breadth of the simulation approaches tested in Task A. Table 1\n provides an overview of the eleven modeling approaches pursued by eight research teams. There are essentially three main strategies each based on a different interpretation of the underlying physics: (1) A variety of teams are pursuing two-phase continuum methods coupled to a range of alternative descriptions of mechanical deformation (elastic, viscoelastic, elastoplastic, damage). (2) Two teams attempt to explain the observed behavior with two-phase continuum models with preferential pathways, in one case assuming separate conduits for water and gas, in the other case accounting for embedded micro-fractures acting as gas conduits. (3) Finally, two teams are applying discrete pathway approaches: (a) a distinct element model to explicitly model the opening of grain boundaries for dilatant gas migration based on a fracture mechanics formulation, and (b) a bubble transport model on the chaotic nonlinear dynamic aspects of gas migration. It is anticipated that by the end of the current DECOVALEX phase in December 2019, this task will provide valuable tested predictive tools to assess the impact of gas flow on barrier and host materials, providing information which can be used to support future repository design.\n\n\n5.2\nUpscaling THM processes observed in various heater experiments\nThe purpose of this task (Task E of the ongoing DECOVALEX-2019 phase) is upscaling THM models using laboratory data (cm scale) applied to small size experiments (a few meters) to real scale emplacement cells (tens of meters) all the way to scale of a waste repository (kilometers). The task, aligned with the French repository design, assumes that waste canisters will be placed horizontally in a series of parallel micro-tunnels drilled from access drifts, each microtunnel about 80\u202fm long and 0.7\u202fm in diameter, in Callovo-Oxfordian claystone (COx) formation (Fig. 21\n). A comprehensive research program was conducted by the French radioactive waste management agency ANDRA in their underground research laboratory near Bure to investigate the THM response of the COx to thermal loading from parallel microtunnels, through laboratory and in situ experiments. The in situ experimental program consists of a step-by-step approach ranging from small-scale heating boreholes (TED experiment) to full-scale experiments (ALC experiment) (Fig. 22\n). Results from these heater experiments, as well as data from large-scale site characterization including geophysical measurements over the repository footprint) have been provided to DECOVALEX.\nLike in most other DECOVALEX tasks, the modeling program is organized in several sub-tasks, in this case including a benchmark test, an interpretive exercise, a blind prediction, and a large-scale application.\n45\n In a first step, the models used are benchmarked against 3D analytical solutions to validate the correctness of code implementation considering THM processes. The second step consists of interpretative modeling of the small-scale in situ heating experiment (TED) realized in ANDRA's URL. The TED experiment, which started in 2010 and ended in 2013, involved three small heaters directly placed into narrow boreholes parallel to each other at a distance of about 2.7\u202fm. The third step involves the interpretation and modeling of a full-scale heating experiment based on results from model calibrations at the smaller scale (TED experiment). ALC is an ongoing in situ test designed as a realistic representation of a micro-tunnel used for waste emplacement using very similar dimensions and designs to the current concept. The interaction between the tunnel support (steel casing in this case), the EDZ, and the surrounding intact rock is closely investigated through this full-scale scale experiment to assess the effect of the thermal loading on the steel structure. The extent of the behavior of one single emplacement cell relative to the behavior at the repository scale (several parallel emplacement cells) will be approached in a last step as a modeling comparison exercise. Key questions addressed in this final step are (1) how to extrapolate data, processes, and models from URL scale (areal size of 0.1\u202fkm2) to the scale of an entire repository of about 9\u202fkm2, and (2) how to take into account the geological variability as evident from site characterization from the small to the large scale? Fig. 22 illustrates the stepwise modeling sequence with steps of increasing scale and complexity. Six modeling teams from five countries are participating in this task.\n\n\n5.3\nInduced slip of a fault in argillaceous rock\nThis modeling task evaluates the conditions for slip activation and stability of faults in clay formations and in particular addresses the complex coupling between fault slip, pore pressure, permeability creation, and fluid migration (Task B in the current DECOVALEX phase). The subject is of great importance to many subsurface applications where injection of fluids leads to pore-pressure increase and reduction of effective normal stresses on faults, which in turn can cause fault reactivation. Regarding radioactive waste emplacement, increases in pore pressure could be caused by release of heat from the high-level waste or by the generation of gas due to steel corrosion. The possibility of an increased permeability caused by fault slip and generation of potential pathways in the host rock in an upper sealing formation could be a major risk for the long-term safety of a repository.\nThe central element of the modeling task is the FS Fault Slip Experiment conducted in 2015\u202fat the Mont Terri URL in Switzerland, which utilized a novel experimental setup for controlled fault slip testing in realistic underground settings at the field scale.\n46\u201348\n As shown in Fig. 23\n, a borehole intersecting a fault was equipped with a newly developed borehole probe consisting of a straddle packer system that can be stepwise pressurized via fluid injection and that contains a three-component extensometer connecting the two packers in the injection chamber. This extensometer is fixed to the borehole wall by hydraulically operated anchors, thus providing a high-resolution and high-frequency device measuring at nano-scale resolution both axial and radial deformations between the upper and lower anchor points. The probe also monitors downhole fluid pressure and flow rate as the fault is slipping, an unprecedented data set for evaluating the transient coupling between fault opening and slip, pore pressure, permeability creation, and fluid migration. Of five injection tests conducted in different boreholes and different intervals at Mont Terri, two tests were selected for modeling within DECOVALEX-2019. The tests provide data for activation of the main fault as well as minor faults\/fractures in the fault damage zone, respectively.\nAs mentioned above, the topic of pressure-induced fault reactivation and seismicity is of relevance to the broader set of subsurface applications; at the same time, issues surrounding fault slip and related permeability creation have not often been a focus of the waste disposal science community. Thus, it made a lot of sense to open up this task to external participation, inviting organizations that have not traditionally part of DECOVALEX. Seven modeling teams from seven countries are currently participating in Task B activities, using a range of methods such as the classical hydro-mechanical continuum models with faults represented as embedded weak planes and the distinct element methods where the rock mass is represented as an assembly of discrete blocks and fault\/fractures are viewed as interfaces between distinct bodies.\nThe modeling task is organized in a stepwise approach. Step 1 comprises benchmark simulations (Fig. 24\n) to evaluate the activation of a simplified fault plane. This allows for necessary model developments and comparative testing related to modeling of fault activation processes, such as developing and testing new constitutive models for fault hydro-mechanical behavior. Based on a successful simulation of the simplified benchmark, teams are now working on Step 2 conducting interpretative modeling of the observed activation and hydromechanical behavior of a minor fault. Step 3 then will move the teams into a final stage to perform interpretative modeling of the complex activation patterns observed in the main fault at Mont Terri, which resulted in strong shear activation and considerable permeability changes.\n\n\n\n6\nConcluding remarks and a brief summary of scientific advances under DECOVALEX\nAs an international cooperative research project, DECOVALEX is probably unique in its longevity and productivity, with no decrease in enthusiasm among the project participants even after 25 years. The current phase of the project, referred to as DECOVALEX-2019, features a record number of tasks (seven) and a near-record number of funding organizations (13). The reason for this enduring success, we believe, is four-fold. First the organization of the cooperative project is simple and effective, allowing the project to adapt itself with scientific advances and with developing research interests of participants. Second, the participants are willing to share data and information from expensive, multi-year field tests and large-scale laboratory experiments, and in some cases, are open to suggestions from DECOVALEX participants to modify the tests and make new measurements. This is obviously very helpful to data-receiving participants who are able to study these data and learn the science behind them, but it is also very helpful to the data-producing participants who benefit from an international group of experts analyzing and simulating their expensive laboratory experiments and field tests from different angles. The insight and scientific knowledge gained in this collaborative setting would not have been possible if one group had studied these data alone. Thirdly, DECOVALEX has always emphasized publications in reputable peer-reviewed journals and in books and monographs. In this way the project opens its work to review and critique from the scientific community at large which helps to maintain the scientific standard of its research. And, fourthly, the project is carried out through frequent and in-depth discussion meetings among the participants in a mutually supportive atmosphere. It has been a pleasant learning experience for all the participants to enter into the complexity and significance of coupled THM and THMC processes in geological media, and it is a good forum to nurture young graduate students and early-career researchers as well as new research teams to bring them up to speed in coupled processes research.\nOver the last 25 years, a number of important advances in coupled THMC research have been made through work in or associated with DECOVALEX. Below we highlight some major accomplishments in reference to the example tasks introduced in this paper. A more complete view may be obtained from books and journal special issues specifically on DECOVALX results, which are in Appendix B for the convenience of the readers.\n\n\u2022\nA definitive study of conceptual model uncertainty by a comparative investigation into coupled THM processes in fractured rock through the use of eight different conceptual models (this was presented in Section 4.1; see Fig. 5). Through such a concrete case study, more insight has been gained on this type of uncertainty and its implication for long-term system evolution.\n\n\n\u2022\nAn in-depth analysis of large complex in-situ experiments studying full-scale THMC processes in different host rocks, demonstrating that the early perturbations from future radioactive waste emplacement can be predicted with good and well-characterized confidence (an example is shown in Section 4.2; see Fig. 8).\n\n\n\u2022\nA comprehensive review of coupled THMC processes in the EDZ around subsurface opening for different rock types: crystalline rock, plastic clay, indurated clay, and salt. This helped to stimulate the study of EDZ in several rock types using the same numerical simulator, thus providing enhanced insight into such systems. As an example of a rock-type specific study, the Ventilation Experiment discussed in Section 4.3 (see Fig. 9) explored how wetting and drying cycles in future waste disposal tunnels may affect the EDZ properties in an indurated clay.\n\n\n\u2022\nA first systematic examination of the ability of discrete and continuum approaches to predict the micro-scale THMC processes occurring in individual fractures exposed to stress, temperature, and reactions (Section 4.4; Figs. 13 and 14).\n\n\n\u2022\nOne of the first detailed studies of coupled hydraulic, mechanical and chemical processes in the bentonite barrier and its interaction with the surrounding rock (an example is given in Section 4.5; see Fig. 17). This laid the ground work for many further studies into coupled processes at the bentonite-rock interface.\n\n\n\nIn addition to in-depth evaluation of coupled processes, the DECOVALEX Project has always been interested in their impact on the long-term safety of a geological repository. For example, one task in DECOVALEX III investigated methods for upscaling the THM properties of a fractured rock mass so that they can be used in large-scale repository performance assessment models. Furthermore, a series of papers were published on the hydromechanical processes in fractured rocks induced by the advancement and retreat of glaciation and its effect on the far-field flow and transport of potential radionuclide leakage from a waste repository to the biosphere. Such studies allowed for establishing clear relationships between coupled processes and overall repository performance.\nAt the 25-year mark of DECOVALEX, it is useful to look back and review the scientific advances that have emerged from DECOVALEX and the possible reasons behind its longevity and continuing success. Perhaps such a review may point to an effective possible approach to future international collaborative research in geosciences. It will also be interesting to follow the future development of DECOVALEX, as discussions are now underway to plan for the next phase, DECOVALEX-2023. Ultimately, it is the interests and needs of the participating organizations that drive the focus of the project by proposing and selecting the modeling tasks. As a result, the research areas of the DECOVALEX project have always closely mirrored the evolution of scientific interest of the community at large, and we expect this correlation to continue, thereby ensuring continued relevance. It is thus a bit speculative when we make an attempt to identify research trends for future DECOVALEX phases but we shall do it here briefly as a framework and starting point for continuing discussion of new ideas. First, we may expect that some aspects of the project will be broadened to include wider geo-engineering problems facing society, such as geologic carbon sequestration and enhanced geothermal resources development, while retaining a core focus on radioactive waste disposal. Second, in terms of topics for future consideration, it is likely that the engineered barrier system (or \u2018near-field\u2019) will remain a priority for the project. Furthermore, potential host-rocks such as evaporitic and diagenetic salts are likely to regain an interest where there are a wide variety of challenges in both radioactive waste and other subsurface engineering applications (e.g., energy storage). In terms of technologies and approaches, it is expected that DECOVALEX will take advantage of increasingly accessible high-performance computing (HPC) together with robust standard libraries for implementing numerical models in massively parallel environments. The current advances of machine-learning cannot be ignored, and it is likely that some of the techniques being developed will facilitate complementary modeling and data analysis approaches. Ultimately the advances made in the DECOVALEX Project will need to be evaluated by their capability to build confidence in the understanding and modeling coupled processes in geo-engineering projects, with the goal of furthering our ability to robustly evaluate the safety of radioactive waste and other sub-surface engineering applications.\n\n","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\nOverview\nIn Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), hydraulic fracturing is used for the exploitation of geothermal resources. EGS was first conceived in the 1970s at the Fenton Hill project at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States. Since then, EGS projects have been pursued around the world. One application of EGS is to improve well productivity and injectivity in conventional geothermal resources, places where high temperature and permeability naturally coexist. A more ambitious application of EGS is to perform stimulation in places where hydrothermal resources do not already exist. At 5km depth, the subsurface is hot enough for geothermal electricity production across a significant percentage of the Earth\u05f3s surface. At this depth, formations are typically very low permeability, which is why hydraulic fracturing is needed. Overall, a spectrum of opportunities exists for EGS. The most economically viable opportunities are the least abundant, and the largest potential resources are the most economically challenging [1].\nIt has been proven that EGS is technically possible. However, challenges remain that inhibit EGS from widespread economic deployment. The two most important obstacles to economic success are (1) inability to achieve adequate flow rate due to insufficiently high formation permeability following stimulation and (2) thermal short-circuiting.\nTypical EGS concepts involve doublet, triplets, or patterns of injectors and producers circulating in closed loops between the formation and a surface power plant. Thermal short-circuiting may occur if a direct fracture pathway connects between the injector and producer, causing the formation to cool down in the vicinity of the short-circuit pathway, leading to low temperatures of produced fluid. For example, thermal short-circuiting occurred at the Hijiori project [2] and the Rosemanowes project [3].\nInadequate permeability and short-circuiting are both related to the properties of the fracture network created during stimulation. An optimal EGS reservoir would have a large number of high permeability fracture pathways, but such an EGS reservoir has never been achieved. Therefore, technical breakthroughs in stimulation design are needed to enable widespread adoption of EGS.\nDesign of hydraulic stimulation depends on having a conceptual model for the processes that generate enhanced permeability during stimulation. We use the term \u201cstimulation mechanism\u201d to refer to these processes. Ideas about stimulation mechanism are embedded in computational modeling tools and in the assumptions made by engineers, scientists, and project managers. We believe there is much greater uncertainty about stimulation mechanism in EGS than is usually acknowledged.\nIn EGS, it is most commonly assumed that stimulation occurs through induced slip on preexisting fractures and that propagation of new fractures, if it occurs, plays a minor role. We refer to this concept at \u201cpure shear stimulation\u201d (PSS). In this paper, we present the hypothesis that in many cases, EGS stimulation creates a complex network of both new and preexisting fractures, a mechanism which we refer to as \u201cmixed-mechanism stimulation\u201d (MMS). The arguments for this hypothesis are not definitive, and the main goal of this paper is to present the rationale for this hypothesis and to stimulate discussion and encourage methodologies, analysis, and field experiments that could confirm or refute it. A complication is that stimulation mechanism may depend on geological and operational parameters, and so conclusions from one project do not necessarily apply to another.\nOur review of the literature shows that bottomhole injection pressure has exceeded or approached the minimum principal stress during stimulation at the great majority of EGS projects. Conventionally, this would be expected to cause propagation of hydraulic fractures from the wellbore. Most EGS wells have been vertical and located in a normal or strike-slip faulting regime. Under these conditions, hydraulic fractures would be expected to form axially along the wellbore. However, wellbore observations from EGS projects indicate that typically, flow has been localized at discrete zones along the wellbore that correlate to the locations of preexisting fractures. To reconcile these facts, we propose that in many cases, new fractures form off natural fractures and then propagate through the formation (chapter 3 of [4]). Most likely, the deviation observed at EGS projects from conventional hydromechanical behavior is related to the geological setting. EGS projects are typically located in crystalline basement formations, which is not a setting where wells are often hydraulically stimulated.\nIn this paper, fractures are considered \u201copen\u201d when their fluid pressure exceeds the normal stress, and their walls come out of contact. Fractures are considered \u201cclosed\u201d when their fluid pressure is less than the normal stress and their walls remain in contact.\n\n\n1.2\nStimulation mechanisms\nA variety of conceptual models for stimulation mechanism have been used by different authors in the EGS and oil and gas hydraulic fracturing literature. \nFig. 1 shows schematics of four different conceptual models [4]. Pure opening mode (POM) stimulation, the classical concept of hydraulic fracturing, is the idea that only new, propagating fractures contribute to permeability enhancement. This conceptual model is widely accepted in the oil and gas industry [7\u201312]. The depiction of POM in Fig. 1 shows several interlocking propagating fractures because mineback and core-across field studies have generally shown that multiple fracture strands form during stimulation [13\u201315].\nPure shear stimulation is the stimulation mechanism most often assumed in the EGS community (discussed more in Section 1.3). In pure shear stimulation, stimulation occurs only through induced slip on preexisting fractures. Natural fractures may open during injection, but few or no new fractures form.\nPrimary fracturing with shear stimulation leakoff (PFSSL) is the idea that continuous new fractures propagate away from the wellbore, but fluid leaks off into natural fractures, which slip and experience enhanced transmissivity. PFSSL has been used in modeling of hydraulic stimulation in shale by [16\u201319]. The PFSSL concept was mentioned by Pearson [20] in an early paper from the Fenton Hill EGS project. Variations on this concept exist, such as the idea is that there is a single primary hydraulic fracture with smaller, newly forming hydraulic fractures surrounding it.\nMixed-mechanism stimulation has been used in modeling of hydraulic fracturing in shale by several authors [21\u201323]. The idea of MMS is that continuous pathways for flow involve both new and preexisting fractures. A key idea is that propagating new fractures may terminate against preexisting fractures. This process could prevent formation of large, continuous fractures, forcing fluid to pass through a more complex network involving both new and preexisting fractures. Fractures not oriented perpendicular to the minimum principal stress could be forced to open, or partially open, by both increased fluid pressure and local stress concentrations created by the opening and sliding of surrounding fractures. These local stress concentrations could allow fractures to open at fluid pressures lower than would be expected from consideration of only their orientation and remote stress field. Fracture termination has been described in laboratory experiments [24\u201327], mine-back experiments [13,15,28,29], and computational investigations [30\u201332].\n\n\n1.3\nEvolution of thinking on stimulation mechanism in EGS\nThe original concept of EGS was to create a single, planar tensile fracture that propagates away from the wellbore [33]. However, early experience at EGS projects at Fenton Hill and Rosemanowes, UK showed that flow from the wellbore occurred at preexisting fractures [33\u201335] and that microseismicity did not always arrange into narrow, planar features oriented perpendicular to the minimum principal stress [6,36,37]. Pine and Batchelor [6] noted that microseismicity at Rosemanowes migrated predominantly downward, defying the expectation that a newly forming tensile fracture should propagate upward (though in Section 4.2.3, we provide an alternative interpretation). Bringing together these observations, the EGS community began to embrace the idea that injection was not causing propagation of new tensile fractures, but rather was stimulating preexisting fractures by inducing slip [6,38]. This concept is referred to as \u201cshear stimulation\u201d [38] or sometimes \u201chydroshearing\u201d [39].\nBy the early 1990s, the shear stimulation concept had been largely accepted in the EGS literature, and the idea of propagation of new fractures during stimulation had fallen out of favor. For example, Lanyon et al. [40] stated \u201cit is believed that although axial fractures may be created close to the borehole, fracturing fluid will be quickly diverted into the most transmissivity natural fractures rather than creating new fractures\u201d. Willis-Richards et al. [41] stated that \u201cover the past few years the favored concept for engineered geothermal reservoirs in Japan has shifted in emphasis from the formation of new fractures in previously intact rock masses to the exploitation of weakly permeable natural fracture systems through stimulation\u201d. The new modeling approach was to generate a discrete fracture network model of the preexisting fracture network stochastically and then to simulate flow and induced stimulation solely in the preexisting fractures.\nA review of EGS modeling since the early 1990s shows that the overwhelming majority of authors have assumed that injection induces slip on preexisting fractures and have neglected the possibility that new fractures form [39\u201357]. A minority of authors have conceptualized EGS stimulation as occurring through the propagation of a planar fracture, the conventional interpretation of hydraulic fracturing [58,59]. A handful of authors have hypothesized that both newly forming and preexisting fractures were important at the Soultz EGS project [60\u201364].\nMany EGS models have assumed pure shear stimulation and have been able to match data from field projects. However, the available data, microseismicity and production\/injection rates and pressures, are sparse, and matches are highly nonunique. Consistency of a model with sparse field data does not prove that the model it true or predictive, particularly because modelers are free to manipulate parameters until a match is achieved [65].\nIn this paper, we attempt to follow the suggestions of Starfield and Cundall [66], who proposed an iterative technique for modeling data-limited problems. They suggested that modeling could be used to identify gaps in knowledge and further data that could be collected in order improve understanding. Once the data have been collected, the models can be refined and the process repeated.\n\n\n1.4\nReview of EGS projects\n\n\nTable 1 summarizes results from ten different EGS projects in granitic rock. Projects are compared on (1) the basis of the orientation of the microseismic cloud with respect to the principal stresses, (2) the relationship between the maximum bottomhole pressure and the magnitude of the minimum principal stress, (3) whether pressure-limiting behavior occurred during stimulation (identified by a significant decrease in the slope of the plot of injection pressure vs. rate or by a constant or decreasing injection pressure during constant rate injection), (4) the maximum thickness of faults observed in the reservoir (more discussion of this topic is in chapter 5 of [4]), (5) the maximum magnitude of induced seismicity, and (6) whether flow from the wellbore localized into discrete zones, and if so, whether these zones were correlated to existing natural fractures. Except for the Desert Peak well, all wells were located in granitic rock.\nComparison between EGS projects is challenging because data have been gathered and interpreted in a variety of ways, projects can involve several wells and numerous separate stimulations, completion and stimulation practices vary, and full records of the projects may be difficult or impossible to find in the literature. To mitigate this problem, we have carefully documented the source of all the information in Table 1. Because many injection periods were performed in many of the projects, we have typically chosen to report injection pressure information (columns 2 and 3) for a particular stimulation test (column 1). In columns 4, 5, 6, and 7, information about overall geological setting and seismic activity at the project is given, and these reported values are not necessarily specific to the stimulation test specified in column 1. In all cases except Cooper Basin and Fj\u00e4llbacka, the minimum principal stress was horizontal.\nIn some cases, bottomhole pressure was measured or authors in the literature provided their own calculation for bottomhole pressure. In these cases, the values of bottomhole pressure from the literature are reported directly in Table 1. In other cases, wellhead pressure was reported in the literature, not bottomhole pressure. In these cases, we have estimated bottomhole pressure by calculating hydrostatic and frictional pressure gradient in the wellbore based on the wellbore design and correlations given by Moody [67]. Details of those calculations are given in the Supplementary material to this paper.\nOur calculations of hydrostatic pressure gradient are inexact because they required us to assume a temperature distribution in the wellbore. We calculated hydrostatic pressure gradient assuming that the fluid was at 25\u00b0C everywhere in the wellbore during injection. This is a simplification because heat conduction into the wellbore would heat the injected fluid as it flowed downward, which means that our calculation will somewhat overestimate the bottomhole pressure. The effect of fluid heating would be relatively minimal during stimulation because of the high rates of injection.\nOur calculations of frictional pressure gradient are inexact because they are based on correlations, we had to assume a temperature distribution in the wellbore, and because we had to assume the roughness of casing or tubing in the well. The absolute roughness was assumed to be 150\u03bcm.\nDuring the stimulation of EE-2 at Fenton Hill, a \u201cfriction reducer\u201d was added to the injection fluid [33]. It is impossible to quantify the effects of this additive. However, there was a 2h period during the stimulation when the friction reducer was not used. The injection rate and wellhead pressure from that two-hour period were used to calculate bottomhole pressure during stimulation.\nThese uncertainties account for a few MPa of uncertainty in our estimates of BHP, which are not large enough to change the overall conclusions and are probably of equal or greater magnitude than the uncertainty in estimates of minimum principal stress available in the literature.\nAt the Fj\u00e4llbacka, Le Mayet, Hijiori (HDR-1), Ogachi, and Rosemanowes projects, the estimated BHP exceeded the minimum principal stress by 5MPa or more. At the Desert Peak, Cooper Basin, and Soultz projects, the estimated BHPs exceed the minimum principal stress by a modest amount. At the Hijiori (SKG-2) project, the estimated BHP was slightly less than the minimum principal stress. The well GPK2 at Soultz was an unusual case because the BHP was substantially below the minimum principal stress profile given by [72]. At the Basel project, information about the minimum principal stress is not available.\nOverall, we can conclude that in all projects (GPK2 at Soultz being an exception) the bottomhole pressure approached or exceeded the minimum principal stress. According to a standard interpretation, fluid pressure greater than the minimum principal stress should indicate that new fractures formed and propagated through the formation [103,104]. Pressure-limiting behavior is believed to be caused by the opening of fractures (walls out of contact), which dramatically increases their transmissivity. However, other observations from EGS projects cloud the interpretation that new fractures are propagating through the formation.\nIn almost every EGS project reviewed, flow from the wellbore occurred at discrete locations along the well. When production and image logs were run, these locations were correlated with natural fractures. This observation is in apparent contradiction to the notion that new fractures propagate away from the wellbore. In a standard interpretation, new fractures should form axially along the wellbore and propagate as continuous planar features through the formation [103,104], but evidently this does not usually occur in EGS wells. This key observation is the most important reason why the EGS community has focused on stimulation of preexisting fracture networks. GPK1 and GPK4 at Soultz are apparently exceptions because flow from the well was observed to occur continuously over extended depth intervals [71,75].\nMicroseismicity from the reviewed projects was diverse. At some projects, a planar region of microseismicity formed that was roughly perpendicular to the minimum principal stress (consistent with a conventional hydraulic fracture). In other projects, planar regions formed at angles to the principal stresses. At many projects, the microseismicity formed into complex shapes with multiple features apparent. Microseismicity is generally caused by slip on preexisting fractures, not by opening and propagation of new fractures. However, fluid leaking off from hydraulic fractures could cause slip on surrounding natural fractures [20].\nOverall, microseismic and wellbore observations from EGS projects appear inconsistent with the concept of generating a single, planar fracture (POM), but pressure data appears inconsistent with the idea that no new fracture opening or propagation occurs (PSS).\n\n\n1.5\nUsing mixed-mechanism stimulation to reconcile theory and observations from historical EGS projects\nDuring stimulation at most EGS projects, the bottomhole fluid pressure reached the minimum principal stress, but axial tensile fractures did not form and propagate away from the wellbore. Possibly, this occurred because the tensile strength of granite is high (EGS projects are most often in granitic rock), which resists formation of new fractures at the wellbore. We hypothesize that in many cases, injection may have caused opening of natural fractures. Natural fractures are not necessarily oriented perpendicular to the minimum principal stress, but usually they should have much lower tensile strength than the surrounding intact rock. If a natural fracture is oriented reasonably close to the optimal direction for fracture opening, it may be able to open at a lower fluid pressure than would be required to overcome the formation tensile strength and form an entirely new fracture.\nShear and opening deformation of natural fractures creates concentrations of stress that could encourage fracture initiation and propagation. \nFig. 2 illustrates two possible mechanisms. One mechanism is that natural fractures, once opened by injection, could propagate from their tips (aided by the concentration of stress caused by their opening), perhaps turning and\/or twisting to align favorably with the local stress field.\nThe second mechanism is that splay fractures could form. Splay fractures have been described widely in rock outcrops [105,106]. Splay fractures form a short distance behind the crack tip, and are caused by concentrations of tensile stress formed by fracture shearing. Both closed and open fractures can experience shear deformation (fractures slide as they open and their frictional resistance to slip goes to zero), and so either could be initiation sites for splay fractures.\nBecause stress is locally concentrated by shear, splay fractures could form whether the fluid pressure was above or below the minimum principal stress. Once splay fractures have formed, the concentration of stress at their tips could allow them to readily propagate through the formation. With fluid pressure above the minimum principal stress, splay fractures could propagate large distances through the formation. With fluid pressure below the minimum principal stress, splay fractures would be limited to the localized region of stress perturbation caused by the shearing natural fracture. If shearing natural fractures were in close proximity, it is conceivable that they could connect through splay fractures and form through-going features, even if the fluid pressure remained below the minimum principal stress (also discussed by Jung [62]).\nMicroseismic observations from EGS projects are consistent with either the MMS or PSS mechanisms. The observations at many projects appear to show planar features oriented at angles to principal stresses. These features are probably sliding (and possibly opening) natural fractures. But this does not preclude the possibility that new fractures could propagate through the formation. Microseismicity maps the sliding of fractures in the reservoir, but because fracture opening and propagation causes minimal seismicity, microseismicity shows a biased and possibly misleading representation of the overall deformation process taking place. For example, a high viscosity stimulation treatment at Rosemanowes is believed to have formed a tensile fracture, but no seismicity was observed during the stimulation [107]. A further complication is that variability in the frictional properties of the minerals infilling the fractures has the potential to cause some fractures to slip seismically and others to slip aseismically [108].\nThe MMS concept is general enough to be consistent with virtually any set of microseismic observations. If propagating hydraulic fractures sometimes terminate when they intersect preexisting fractures or faults, large and continuous new fractures will not be able to propagate through the formation. Continuous pathways for flow will be forced to pass through both new and preexisting fractures.\nTherefore, the overall stimulation direction and the shape of the seismic cloud will be strongly affected by the natural fracture network, whether or not new fractures are propagating through the formation.\n\n\n\n2\nMaterial and methods\n\n2.1\nModeling study of pure shear stimulation and mixed-mechanism stimulation\nThe pure shear stimulation mechanism is probably unlikely unless the fluid pressure is kept below the minimum principal stress during stimulation (though splay fractures could still form). If fluid pressure exceeds the minimum principal stress, fracture opening is likely to occur and new fractures may propagate through the formation.\nIn order to prevent excessive buildup of fluid pressure, the stimulated formation permeability must be adequate and the formation must have the ability to store the injected fluid without fracture opening (since typically the formation permeability is exceptionally low). For these requirements to be fulfilled, several geological conditions must be present: (1) adequate storativity of closed natural fractures, (2) adequate initial transmissivity of natural fractures, (3) percolation of the natural fracture network, (4) natural fractures well-oriented to slip in the local stress state, (5) natural fractures that experience enhanced transmissivity with slip, and (6) adequate stimulated transmissivity. Requirements (4), (5), and (6) are obvious. By definition, shear stimulation cannot occur unless injection causes slip and the slip causes sufficient increase in formation permeability. In the following sections, we use modeling to demonstrate requirements (1), (2), and (3). An additional simulation is performed as an example of mixed-mechanism stimulation.\n\n\n2.2\nDetails of the numerical model\nSimulations were performed with CFRAC, a modeling code that fully couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by deformation in discrete fracture networks. The details of the code are summarized here. Full details were given by McClure and Horne [5].\nThe version of CFRAC used in this study assumes single-phase liquid water (no proppant), isothermal, Darcy flow in the fractures and zero flow in the matrix around the fractures. The water properties are calculated assuming fresh water at a temperature of 200\u00b0C. The high temperature causes the fluid density to be around 850kg\/m3 and the viscosity to be around 0.1\u20130.2cP. Stresses induced by fracture deformation are calculated with the displacement discontinuity (boundary element) method using quadratic basis functions assuming homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic deformation [109]. CFRAC uses Hmmvp, a code that approximates the matrices of interaction coefficients very accurately and efficiently [110]. Stresses induced by normal displacement of closed fractures (which are typically due to fracture stiffness and are quite small) are neglected. The simulations are two-dimensional, and should be interpreted as showing vertical fractures sliding horizontally, viewed from above, or normal fractures sliding in dip-slip, viewed from the side. In the simulations shown in this paper, the [111] adjustment was used to approximate the effect of a finite formation height on the induced stresses (so that the calculations are pseudo-3D instead of either plane strain or plane stress).\nThe edges of the model are treated like no-flow boundaries. The stresses induced by deformation are calculated assuming an elastic whole-space. The model is initialized with a homogeneous distribution of fluid pressure and stress, and the stress field is permitted to be anisotropic.\nBecause CFRAC is a discrete fracture network simulator, each individual fracture is discretized. It is only necessary to discretize the fractures, not the matrix, because it is assumed that there is zero matrix permeability and the boundary element method is used to calculate the stresses induced by deformation. Implicit time-stepping is used. At each element during every time-step, the fluid pressure and (if the element is opening and\/or sliding) opening and sliding displacements are calculated to satisfy the unsteady state mass balance equation and appropriate stress conditions. Fractures may be closed (walls in contact) or open (walls out of contact), depending on whether the fluid pressure is less than the element normal stress. If the walls are in contact, Coulomb\u05f3s law with constant coefficient of friction is used to determine if the fracture should slide, and if so, displacements are calculated so that Coulomb\u05f3s law is satisfied. For fractures with shear stress less than the frictional resistance to slip, shear deformation is assumed to be negligible. If walls are out of contact, displacements are calculated so that the walls bear nearly zero shear stress. As a numerical convenience, open fractures are given a small cohesion, S\n0,open\n. Open fractures do not slide if the absolute value of their shear stress is below S\n0,open\n.\nA radiation damping term [112,113] is included in the expression for shear stress to approximate the effect of inertia at high slipping velocity (though high slipping velocity did not occur in the simulations in this paper, because a constant coefficient of friction was used) and to prevent sliding from happening instantaneously.\nThe unsteady-state fluid mass balance equation in a fracture is (adapted from [114]) as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n(\n\u03c1\nE\n)\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\u2207\n\u00b7\n(\n\nq\n\nf\nl\nu\nx\n\n\ne\n)\n+\n\ns\na\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the fluid density, E is the void aperture (volume of fluid contained per fracture area), t is the time, q\n\nflux\n is the mass flux (scalar-valued for a one-dimensional fracture and vector-valued for a two-dimensional fracture), e is the hydraulic aperture (related to flow through Eqs. (2) and (3) below), and s\n\na\n is a source term.\nFor single-phase flow in a one-dimensional fracture, the mass flow rate q is as follows:\n\n(2)\n\nq\n=\n\n\nT\nh\n\u03c1\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nP\n\n\n\u2202\ns\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere T is the transmissivity (the product of permeability and hydraulic aperture), h is the out-of-plane dimension of the fracture, P is the pressure, s is the distance along the fracture, and \u03bc\n\nl\n is the viscosity. The cubic law for fracture transmissivity is [115] as follows:\n\n(3)\n\nT\n=\nk\ne\n=\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n3\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n.\n\n\nThe harmonic average of transmissivity is used for flow between adjacent fracture elements. The Coulomb failure criterion with a radiation damping term is as follows [113]:\n\n(4)\n\n|\n\u03c4\n\u2212\n\u03b7\n\u03bd\n|\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n\nn\n\n\n+\n\n\nS\n\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the shear stress, \u03b7 is the radiation damping coefficient, v is the sliding velocity of the fracture, \u03bc\n\nf\n is the coefficient of friction, S\n0 is the fracture cohesion, and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n\nn\n\n\n is the effective normal stress, defined as follows [113]:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2212\nP\n,\n\n\nwhere compressive stress is taken to be positive.\nNonlinear relationships are used between fracture stress, fluid pressure, opening displacement, sliding displacement, hydraulic aperture, and void aperture (modified from [41]):\n\n(6)\n\nE\n=\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n(\n9\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n\nn\n\n\n\/\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n,\nE\nr\ne\nf\n\n\n)\n\n\n+\n\n\nD\n\n\nE\n,\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\ntan\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nE\nd\ni\nl\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n(\n9\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n\nn\n\n\n\/\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n,\nE\nr\ne\nf\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n]\n\n,\n\n\nwhere E\n0, \u03c3\n\nn\n,\nEref\n, and \u03d5\nEdil\n are the specified constants. D\n\nE,eff\n is defined as equal to D if D<D\n\nE,eff,max\n, and equal to D\n\nE,eff,max\n otherwise. Eq. (6) is also used for hydraulic aperture, but different constants can be specified (for example, E\n0 for void aperture and e\n0 for hydraulic aperture). Non-zero \u03d5\nEdil\n corresponds to pore volume dilation with slip, and non-zero \u03d5\nedil\n corresponds to transmissivity enhancement with slip.\nHydraulic aperture is equal to void aperture between two smooth plates but is lower than void aperture for rough surfaces such as rock fractures [116]. A \u201cfracture\u201d in a discrete fracture network (DFN) model may represent a crack, but it may also represent a more complex feature such as a fault zone (Section 2.3.3 of [5]). In the latter case, the void aperture may be much larger than the hydraulic aperture, which is why the model allows e and E to be different.\nThe void and hydraulic aperture of an open preexisting fracture is defined as follows:\n\n(7)\n\nE\n=\n\n\nE\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\nD\n\n\nE\n,\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\ntan\n(\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nE\nd\ni\nl\n\n\n)\n+\n\n\nE\n\n\no\np\ne\nn\n\n\ne\n=\n\n\ne\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\nD\n\n\ne\n,\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\ntan\n(\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\ne\nd\ni\nl\n\n\n)\n+\n\n\nE\n\n\no\np\ne\nn\n\n\n\n\nwhere E\n\nopen\n is the physical separation between the fracture walls. The magnitude of E\n\nopen\n is calculated at each open element at each time-step.\nThe hydraulic and void apertures of newly formed fractures are treated differently than preexisting fractures. A value E\n\nhfres\n is defined as the aperture of a newly formed fracture when the fluid pressure is equal to the normal stress. Hydraulic aperture, e, is set equal to void aperture, E. The aperture of an open, newly formed fracture is as follows:\n\n(8)\n\nE\n=\n\n\nE\n\n\nh\nf\nr\ne\ns\n\n\n+\n\n\nE\n\n\no\np\ne\nn\n\n\n\n\nand the aperture of a closed, newly formed fracture is as follows:\n\n(9)\n\nE\n=\n\n\nE\n\n\nh\nf\nr\ne\ns\n\n\nexp\n(\n\u2212\n\n\nK\n\n\nh\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n\nn\n\n\n)\n,\n\n\nwhere K\n\nhf\n is a specified compressibility for closed hydraulic fracture elements.\nIf closed, the transmissivity of a newly formed fracture is defined as follows:\n\n(10)\n\nT\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\nh\nf\n,\nf\na\nc\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nh\nf\nr\ne\ns\n\n\n,\n\n\nand if open, transmissivity is defined as follows:\n\n(11)\n\nT\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\nh\nf\n,\nf\na\nc\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nh\nf\nr\ne\ns\n\n\n+\n\n\n(\n\n\nE\n\n\no\np\ne\nn\n\n\n)\n\n3\n\n\/\n12\n,\n\n\nwhere T\n\nhf,fac\n is a specified constant.\nNew fractures can form and propagate, but the location, orientation, and length of these newly forming fractures must be specified in advance, as \u201cpotentially forming\u201d hydraulic fractures. Both the propagation of new fractures and the propagation of opening along a preexisting fracture are handled with linear fracture mechanics. Propagation occurs if the stress intensity factor at the opening crack tip reaches a specified fracture toughness [5]. Details of fracture initiation and propagation were given by McClure and Horne [5].\nFracture storativity (also called storage coefficient) is defined as follows:\n\n(12)\n\nS\n=\nE\n\nc\nf\n\n+\n\n\nd\nE\n\n\nd\nP\n\n\n\n\nwhere c\n\nf\n is the compressibility of the fluid in the fracture. In our simulations, the fluid was water at 200\u00b0C, which had a compressibility of around 7\u00d710\u22124\nMPa\u22121. Fracture void aperture was assumed to be a highly nonlinear function of effective normal stress (Eq. 6), which meant that fracture storativity varied widely depending on fluid pressure, stress state, and orientation.\n\n\n2.3\nDetails of specific simulations\nFive simulations (A1, A2, A3, B1, and B2) were performed to investigate the effect of geological factors on the tendency for shear stimulation. One additional simulation, simulation C, was performed to investigate the properties of fracture networks formed from mixed-mechanism stimulation.\nSimulation A1 was a baseline simulation where all requirements were met for effective shear stimulation. Simulations A2 and A3 were identical to simulation A1, except that simulation A2 had a lower initial transmissivity (lower e\n0), and simulation A3 had a lower fracture storativity (lower E\n0) and higher initial transmissivity (higher e\n0). Potentially forming hydraulic fractures were specified, initiating at the wellbore and propagating linearly in the y-axis direction, freely crossing preexisting fractures. These fractures could only form if fluid pressure exceeded the minimum principal stress. Simulations A1, A2, and A3 used injection\/production schedule S1, which was injection at 30kg\/s, 60kg\/s, and 90kg\/s for one hour each. Then the wellbore was shut-in for one week (with crossflow through the well permitted), followed by one day of production at 30kg\/s with a minimum bottomhole production pressure of 30MPa.\nSimulations B1 and B2 simulated constant pressure injection (at pressure less than the minimum principal stress). Roughly the same number of fractures intersected the wellbore in simulations B1 and B2, but in simulation B2, there were a greater number of shorter fractures and the network was not percolating. As a model assumption, new fractures could not form in simulations B1 and B2. Injection schedule S2, used by simulations B1 and B2, was constant pressure injection for one week at 48MPa.\nSimulation C was performed to investigate the overall behavior of a fracture network stimulated through mixed-mechanism stimulation. A non-percolating natural fracture network was used, but a large number of potentially forming fractures were located throughout the model. These potentially forming fractures propagated off slipping natural fractures like splay fractures. Injection schedule S1 was used, the same as in simulations A1, A2, and A3, including the full sequence of injection, shut-in, and production. One objective of simulation C was to investigate how closure of natural fractures after shut-in could result in loss of fracture connectivity (Section 4.1.5), and so fracture properties were chosen so that natural fractures would have relatively low transmissivity when closed.\nThe fractures in simulations A1 and A2 had large storativity, intended to represent thick fault zones. Fractures in the other simulations had significantly lower storativity, intended to represent crack-like features. Simulation A3 is the only simulation where e\n0 and E\n0 were equal. In all simulations, the minimum principal stress was 50MPa in the x-axis direction. The principal stress in the y-axis direction was 75MPa in every simulation except simulation C, where it was 55MPa.\n\n\nTable 2 shows the settings common to all the simulations, and \nTable 3 shows the settings that varied between the different simulations. To provide context, Table 3 gives values of transmissivity and storativity, calculated from Eq. (6) for closed natural fractures at initial conditions (P equal to 35MPa) and \u201cstimulated\u201d conditions (P equal to 50MPa and D equal to D\n\ne,eff,max\n). Ranges of values are given because they depend on fracture orientation. Inspection of Table 3 shows that: (1) fracture storativity is much higher at higher pressure, (2) fracture transmissivity increases strongly with both increasing pressure and sliding displacement, and (3) stress anisotropy causes transmissivity and storativity to be strong functions of fracture orientation.\nThe storativity of a hydraulic fracture formed in granite was estimated by Jung [117] to be about 10\u22124\nm\/MPa at an effective normal stress of 1.9MPa. Table 3 shows that for simulations A3, B1, B2, and C, which were intended to include \u201ccrack-like\u201d natural fractures, the fracture storativity at effective normal stress equal to zero (P=50MPa, for a crack perpendicular to the minimum principal stress) was around 10\u22124\nMPa. However, at higher values of effective normal stress, storativity was much lower. This is a property of the [41] equation for fracture aperture (Eq. 6) and is consistent with observations from laboratory experiments, which show fracture stiffness increasing with effective normal stress [118].\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigs. 3\u20136, 8\u201310, and 13 show the transmissivity in the fracture networks at various times during the simulations. Figs. 7 and 11 show injection rate and pressure and production rate and pressure during Simulation A1. Fig. 12 shows production rate and pressure during simulation A3. For brevity, figures showing injection and production rate and pressure over the full time period are not provided for all simulations. Figures have been selected because they can be used to illustrate key points.\nInjection pressure did not exceed the minimum principal stress during simulation A1 (Fig. 7) but did exceed the minimum principal stress during stimulations A2 and A3 (not shown in a figure). Plots of injection rate versus time during simulations B1 and B2 are not shown. In both simulations, the injection rate was low because the fracture transmissivity was limited. Injection rate declined over time in both. In simulation B2, the injection rate declined to nearly zero at late time, as the wellbore-connected fractures reached a fluid pressure equal to the injection pressure. More detailed discussion of this type of behavior was given by McClure and Horne [119].\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nSimulation results\n\n4.1.1\nConditions for shear stimulation\nSimulations A1, A2, A3, B1, and B2 demonstrate that to maintain fluid pressure below the minimum principal stress during shear stimulation, the preexisting fracture network must be percolating and have adequate initial transmissivity and storativity. Simulation A1 was a baseline case where all conditions were met for shear stimulation. The fracture network was percolating, the initial transmissivity of the fractures was reasonably high, and the fractures had high storativity (E\n0 equal to 5cm). The large void apertures in simulations A1 and A2 were intended to represent the thick, porous fault zones that have been described at some EGS projects [74,120].\n\n\n4.1.2\nInitial transmissivity\nIn simulation A2, the initial transmissivity of the natural fracture network was very low, leading to the formation and propagation of an opening mode fracture. Fig. 4 shows the fracture network after 9.568h. Injection was performed for only three hours. Fig. 4 demonstrates that even hours after shut-in, almost all injected fluid was located in the newly formed hydraulic fracture, not in the natural fractures. Because of the very low initial fracture transmissivity, fluid was not able to flow into the natural fractures fast enough to prevent buildup of the injection pressure to the minimum principal stress, causing formation of the hydraulic fracture. Eventually, fluid eventually was able to leak off into the natural fractures and induce slip and shear stimulation, allowing closure of the hydraulic fracture (Fig. 5). Simulation A2 is a rather extreme case because of the exceptionally low initial transmissivity, but it demonstrates in principle that new fractures may form in a reservoir that is capable of being shear stimulated if the initial fracture transmissivity is too low to accept fluid at sufficient rate.\nOnce slip has initiated on a fault, the interaction of fluid flow, induced stresses, and shear stimulation can enable fluid to propagate quickly, at a rate that is unrelated to the initial fracture transmissivity [4,54]. However, the initiation of opening or sliding on a preexisting fracture depends on fluid seeping into the fracture at the initial transmissivity, which could be much slower. The interaction of these processes can cause episodic propagation of stimulation [4].\n\n\n4.1.3\nStorativity\nIn simulation A3, the closed fracture storativity was low, leading to an unrealistically rapid propagation of stimulation. Fig. 6 shows that in simulation A3, stimulation propagated hundreds of meters from the wellbore in around 5min. If this had ever happened at an EGS project, it would have manifested as an exceptionally rapid spreading of microseismicity. We are not aware of a field case where microseismicity caused by stimulation spread from the injector so rapidly.\nIt is striking that this result is so unrealistic because the fracture aperture values used in the simulation, hundreds of microns, are consistent with laboratory observations of cracks [118,121,122]. Simulation A3 was the only simulation where the specified e\n0 was equal to E\n0. Closed cracks cannot contain much fluid, and so if fractures do not open and only crack-like fracture features are present, an exceptionally large fracture surface area must be required to contain the great volumes of fluid injected during an EGS stimulation (thousands or tens of thousands of cubic meters of fluid). Wellbore logs suggest that flowing fractures in typical EGS wells are widely spaced (tens or hundreds of meters), and so there are apparently not many fractures participating in flow [33,68,71,81,87,123,124]. Fluid could be stored in the matrix, but the matrix permeability in typical EGS wells is exceptionally low. If the fracture transmissivity were lower, the apparent hydraulic diffusivity could be reduced, but in this case, the initial fracture transmissivity would be too low, and tensile fracturing would occur, as in simulation A2. Considering these issues, it is difficult to imagine how widely spaced, crack-like fracture features could contain the huge volumes of water that have been injected without opening (which requires fluid pressure to exceed the minimum principal stress).\nIf cracks open, they can have void aperture as large as millimeters to centimeters. Therefore, when high rate injection is performed into formations with very low matrix permeability and that contain only thin, closed fractures, the only possible way the fluid could be contained in the formation is for fracture opening to occur, whether opening of natural fractures or propagation of new fractures. This argument was used by Pearson [20] to support the idea that fracture opening occurred at Fenton Hill.\nIn large thick fault zones, hydrothermally altered zones can develop with much higher porosity than the surrounding rock. For example, at Soultz, Genter et al. [74] described fault zones from core with thickness up to ten meters and porosity ranging from 1.7% to 25%. In contrast, the surrounding granite had a porosity of less than 1%. Thick porous fault zones such as these could certainly contain the large volumes of fluid injected without requiring fracture opening. Of the ten projects reviewed in Table 1, evidence suggests that large, thick faults were present at only three of them.\nAn alternative possibility is that the shear induced mismatch of asperities and macroscopic nonplanarities creates sufficiently significant void dilation that effective fracture void apertures of crack-like fractures become very large. The question of whether or how huge volumes of fluid could be stored only in closed, thin cracks (in the absence of thick, porous fault zones) is worth further investigation. Regardless, it is reasonable to conclude that fracture opening should be more likely in formations where thick, porous faults are not present.\n\n\n4.1.4\nPercolation\nIn Simulations B1 and B2, a similar number of fractures with similar orientations intersect the well. However, the average fracture length in simulation B2 is much lower than in B1, and as result, the network in simulation B2 is not percolating (there are no continuous pathways for flow through the network).\nAs a model parameter in simulations B1 and B2, new fractures were not permitted to form. Injection was performed at a constant pressure less than the minimum principal stress. In both cases, injection caused shear stimulation to occur, but in simulation B2, the fluid was not able propagate a significant distance from the wellbore. If injection had been performed at specified rate in simulation B2 (which is what has been done at most EGS projects), fluid pressure would have been forced to build up until new fractures propagated through the formation.\nSimulations B1 and B2 are an example of what McClure and Horne [119] called a \u201ctendency for shear stimulation test\u201d. Because splay fractures can form even if the fluid pressure is below the minimum principal stress, it may be possible that these could form continuous pathways for flow, even without a percolating natural fracture network. This possibility deserves further study and would depend on factors such as natural fracture orientation, stress anisotropy, and fracture spacing.\n\n\n4.1.5\nMixed-mechanism stimulation and flowback behavior\nSimulation C was an example of mixed-mechanism stimulation. In simulation C, there were natural fractures well oriented to slip and capable of experiencing a limited degree of shear stimulation. However, the natural fracture network was not percolating. When specified rate injection was performed, the fluid pressure built up and new fractures began to propagate through the formation. The two principal stresses were within 5MPa (unlike in the other simulations), which meant that the natural fractures could open at a fluid pressure only modestly greater than the minimum principal stress. During injection, the injection pressure did in fact exceed the minimum principal stress by a few MPa (not shown in a figure).\nEven if the two principal stresses had been further apart than 5MPa, it would still have been possible for natural fracture to open in response to injection. If propagating hydraulic fractures frequently terminate against preexisting fractures, the injection pressure could be forced to increase further above the minimum principal stress, and this could open natural fractures that are not oriented optimally against the minimum principal stress. There also may be significant heterogeneity in the initial distribution of stress. Natural fractures may open in locations where there is lower than average stress, and once opened, serve as initiation sites for new fractures, which can then propagate through the formation. In practice, reliable estimates of the intermediate principal stress are difficult to obtain, and so it may be difficult to evaluate how readily natural fractures may be opened.\n\nTable 1 indicates that at some EGS projects, Ogachi, Rosemanowes, Hijiori (HDR-1), Le Mayet, and Fj\u00e4llbacka, the bottomhole fluid pressure exceeded the minimum principal stress by 5MPa or more, indicating that a wide variety of natural fracture orientations should have been capable of opening (especially in the more shallow projects, where the difference between the principal stresses was less).\nIn simulation C, propagating fractures terminated when they intersected natural fractures (as a model assumption). This prevented a single continuous fracture from propagating across the reservoir (as in simulation A2). Instead, continuous pathways for flow passed through both new and preexisting fractures. Even though there were many places where new fractures had the opportunity to form, flow from the wellbore was primarily localized into a single zone. Localization occurred because the stresses induced by the fracture opening created a stress shadow, increasing normal stress on the surrounding fractures. Simultaneously, the induced stresses created a concentration of tensile stress in the y-axis direction, encouraging further propagation of opening in the y-axis direction.\nStimulation localized into a region that was broadly perpendicular to the minimum principal stress. The microseismic cloud created by this type of deformation might look quite similar to the cloud created by the propagation of a single planar fracture (Section 3.4.9 of [4]). However, it is not necessarily a characteristic of MMS that stimulation should form into a planar region perpendicular to the minimum principal stress. Interactions between newly forming fractures and a spatially variable natural fracture network could cause MMS stimulation to be directed in unpredictable directions and geometries.\n\nFig. 13 shows the final fracture transmissivity distribution in simulation C, zoomed in on a particular region near the wellbore. Two natural fractures intersecting the wellbore have closed (walls in contact) while the newly formed fractures (perpendicular to the minimum principal stress) that propagate off them remain open. During injection, the fluid pressure was elevated so that the natural fractures opened. During flowback, the fluid pressure drawdown caused the open natural fractures to close, significantly reducing their transmissivity (there was no proppant), and hydraulically isolating the open, newly formed fractures away from the wellbore. Over time, the open fractures would be able to drain to the wellbore through the closed natural fractures, but this would happen slowly because of the relatively low transmissivity of the closed natural fractures.\nThe fracture closure events in simulation C led to a different reservoir behavior during production than in simulation A1, where only shear stimulation occurred and there was no fracture opening. In simulation A1, fluid pressure drew down gradually during constant rate production, and rate decreased gradually during subsequent constant pressure production (Fig. 11). In simulation C, when the fluid pressure was low enough, the natural fractures intersecting the wellbore closed, causing a sharp decrease in the wellbore\u05f3s connection to the reservoir and an abrupt drop in production rate and pressure (Fig. 12).\nIn simulation C, when the production period began, the fluid pressure was almost as high as it had been at the end of injection. Fractures remained open in the reservoir, both in the newly formed and natural fractures. It is unrealistic that the wellbore pressure decreased only slightly during the one-week shut-in period in the model. One reason was the lack of leakoff into the matrix. Another cause of declining fluid pressure after shut-in may be the further propagation of hydraulic fractures and spreading of fluid into additional preexisting fractures [125]. The spreading of the stimulated region was artificially limited during simulation C because the no-flow boundaries at the edges of the model.\nWith sufficient pressure decline during shut-in, fracture closure events could occur during the shut-in period. This would result in a more subtle pressure signal than if closure occurred during production. The exceptionally sharp decline in rate and pressure during simulation C is exaggerated by the modeling parameters that caused the stimulated fracture transmissivity to be so low and because the similarly oriented natural fractures all closed almost simultaneously. Nevertheless, these closure events may be apparent from pressure transient analysis, and in fact, were described by [34] at the Fenton Hill Project. Pressure inflections during shut-in may also be caused by episodic growth of the stimulated region, as described in Section 4.1.2.\nIn actual reservoirs, whether closure events cause significant loss of fracture connectivity (and whether they are apparent in the pressure transient) will depend on the transmissivity of the closed fractures and the specifics of the fracture geometry. In some reservoirs, like Soultz, the fracture network (which had thick, porous fault zones) had relatively high transmissivity, even when closed. But at other reservoirs, like Fenton Hill, the closed fractures apparently had much lower transmissivity. Even in a reservoir like Soultz, hydraulic fractures may form during injection, and they may close and cause a loss of fracture connectivity (whether or not this is apparent in the falloff pressure transient).\n\n\n4.1.6\nDiagnosing stimulation mechanism\nThe best way to diagnose stimulation mechanism would be to stimulate a well and then core a second well through the region of microseismicity. Ideally, the cored well would be drilled in the direction of the minimum principal stress in order to ensure that it encountered newly formed fractures (if present). Natural fractures will typically contain mineralization that will be absent from newly formed fractures, which could be used to identify whether fractures encountered in the core are natural or newly created. A tracer could be placed in the stimulation fluid that could then be identified in the core to see which fractures received fluid during stimulation. Flow tests could be performed in the cored well, and flow logs could identify which fractures are most important for flow. Several core-across projects from oil and gas stimulation where newly formed and preexisting fractures were distinguished were summarized by Mahrer [15].\nThere may be a significant opportunity in future research to identify pressure transient techniques for diagnosing stimulation mechanisms. Techniques exist for post-injection closure analysis to estimate the minimum principal stress assuming a single, linear, continuous, opening mode fracture [126]. With a network of multiple fractures of different orientations, different fractures should close at different levels of pressure (as observed in simulation C). Under these conditions, closure events may occur at a fluid pressure greater than the minimum principal stress (as discussed in Section 4.1.5). These might be observed during either shut-in or flowback.\nIt has been hypothesized [34] that at Fenton Hill, multiple fractures with different orientations were opened by injection. Inflection points were identified in the shut-in pressure decline curve, and it was hypothesized that these inflections represented closures of particular fractures or sets of fractures at different orientations. Development of new pressure transient techniques for mixed-mechanism stimulation will require coupled simulation of fluid flow and deformation. Closure would only be expected to be visible during shut-in or flowback if there was a large contrast in transmissivity between open and closed fractures.\nIt has been proposed [119] that intentional injection at bottomhole fluid pressure slightly below the minimum principal stress could be performed as a \u201ctendency for shear stimulation\u201d (TSS) test. At the Desert Peak EGS project, a tendency for shear stimulation test was effectively performed [89,119]. Initially, injection rate was controlled to maintain the bottomhole fluid pressure below the minimum principal stress. An injectivity increase was observed, but subsequent testing found that most of the increase was temporary [89]. Regardless of the reason for the reversibility, the result was that the formation experienced limited shear stimulation. Subsequently, a higher rate injection was performed where the fluid pressure exceeded the minimum principal stress. A substantially larger, permanent increase in injectivity was achieved. It could be argued that the higher injection pressure was required to cause the preexisting fractures to slip, but a critical stress analysis prior to stimulation predicted that abundant fractures were present that were capable of slipping at the pressure used during the initial injection [127]. The more likely explanation is that new hydraulic fractures propagated through the formation during the high rate injection. The low rate injection demonstrated that the formation had a relatively low tendency for shear stimulation. Spinner logs during injection indicated the localization of flow into a handful zones, primarily a single zone (Ethan Chabora, personal communication). Therefore, even though new fractures formed, these new fractures either formed off preexisting fractures or formed at the wellbore over only short intervals.\nAt every EGS project except Desert Peak, injection has been performed at specified rate (most often, several periods of constant rate injection, with rate increasing in steps from one period to the next). If a formation is unable to prevent excessive pressure buildup during injection at a specified rate, the fluid pressure will rise until it reaches the minimum principal stress, potentially causing the propagation of new fractures. After the stimulation, it will be ambiguous to what degree stimulation was caused by new fractures and by shear stimulation. Because bottomhole pressure (BHP) was intentionally maintained below the minimum principal stress during the low rate injection at Desert Peak, tensile fracturing could not occur (except perhaps localized splay fractures), and it was possible to demonstrate conclusively that shear stimulation had limited effectiveness [119].\n\n\n\n4.2\nStimulation mechanism and historic EGS projects\n\n4.2.1\nDegree of fault zone development\nThe presence of well-developed, thick fault zones should increase the probability that pure shear stimulation is possible. Thick faults provide storativity to contain injected fluid and tend to be spatially extensive, ensuring that there is a percolating natural fracture network. Large faults are more likely to be naturally permeable, making it more likely that there will be adequate initial transmissivity to initiate shear stimulation. Once slip has initiated on the fault, the interaction of induced stresses with fluid flow and transmissivity enhancement can help propagate stimulation and prevent excessive pressure buildup [4,54,119].\nOf the ten EGS projects reviewed, the evidence suggests that thick faults were present at three or four of them: Soultz, Cooper Basin, Basel, and possibly Fj\u00e4llbacka (Table 1). Soultz, Cooper Basin, and Basel are the three projects where widespread seismicity above magnitude 2.0 occurred [120]. The seismicity indicates that there was more extensive fracture slip occurring at these projects than at others (though aseismic slip could be an alternative explanation for limited seismicity [108]).\nAccording to the stress profile described by Valley and Evans [72], bottomhole fluid pressure remained substantially below the minimum principal stress during the stimulation of GPK2 at Soultz. This is a rare EGS case where high rate stimulation was performed, and fluid pressure remained significantly below the minimum principal stress. Conversely, the wells GPK4 and GPK1 were the only examples that we found in the literature where flow was distributed uniformly along the wellbore, apparently indicating formation and propagation of an axial fracture [75]. At Cooper Basin, slip occurred on a large fault intersected by the well, but the bottomhole pressure (BHP) nevertheless reached the minimum principal stress (but did not exceed it substantially) [69,70].\nOverall, the evidence from the literature is consistent with the notion that larger thick faults increase the probability that pure shear stimulation will be possible, but does not preclude the possibility that specified rate injection could cause both propagation of new fractures and slip on the faults. We believe that of all historic EGS projects, the projects at Soultz, Cooper Basin, and Basel are most likely to have been dominantly shear stimulation, though significant propagation of new fractures is also possible. GPK4 and GPK1 at Soultz are examples where a new tensile fracture formed at the wellbore. At projects where thick, well-developed faults were not present, mixed-mechanism stimulation is more likely to have occurred.\n\n\n4.2.2\nFenton Hill\nSeveral lines of evidence from the Fenton Hill project support the MMS hypothesis. Brown [34] described repeatable mini-frac tests where the fracture opening and closure pressure was around 15MPa greater than the inferred minimum principal stress. It was hypothesized that this occurred because the natural fractures opening at the wellbore were not oriented perpendicular to the minimum principal stress. Brown [34] analyzed shut-in transients after injection and identified two inflection points, one at the inferred minimum principal stress and another at a higher pressure value consistent with the inferred normal stress on the predominant natural fracture orientation. Brown [34] noted that opening\/closure pressures during mini-frac tests were not elevated above the minimum principal stress in the shallower phase I Fenton Hill reservoir, which he attributed to the presence of natural fractures nearly perpendicular to the minimum principal stress at that depth.\nDuring a one month period of circulation between an injector and producer in the phase II Fenton Hill reservoir, a significantly larger volume of fluid was injected than produced. Subsequently, the wells were shut-in for three months and then the reservoir was vented from the production well for two months. After the venting period, the production well was shut-in. The bottomhole pressure (BHP) built back up, trending towards the inferred value of the minimum principal stress [34]. Brown [34] interpreted these results as showing that most fluid was stored in open fractures that were oriented perpendicular to the minimum principal stress. Brown [34] believed they were connected to the production well through the closed (low transmissivity) natural fractures intersecting the wellbore, which explained why the open fractures (presumably high transmissivity because the walls are out of contact) could not be fully drained and closed even after two months of venting.\nThe scenario described by Brown [34] is precisely what occurred in simulation C (Fig. 13). In simulation C, production caused the natural fractures that were not oriented perpendicular to the minimum principal stress to close, hydraulically isolating open fractures away from the wellbore. Brown [34] apparently did not believe that these open fractures were newly formed, but we believe it is reasonable to suppose new fractures formed (Section 1.5), especially because Brown [34] reports that natural fractures oriented perpendicular to the minimum principal stress were not present in the phase II reservoir. This conclusion may be clouded by the apparent presence of a casing leak that may have created some connection between the phases I and II reservoirs [34].\nBrown et al. [33] described an experiment from the Fenton Hill project that supports the mixed-mechanism hypothesis. During mini-frac tests, impression packers indicated that fluid was opening natural fractures, rather than creating new tensile fractures. After the mini-frac tests, fluid recovery was surprisingly low. The Fenton Hill staff had three hypotheses to explain the limited recovery: that fluid was leaking off into the matrix, that fluid was leaking off into the natural fractures, and that \u201csnap-off\u201d was occurring, where the opened fracture was closing near the wellbore (this process has been described theoretically by Hickman and Zoback [128]). To distinguish between the possibilities, a mini-frac test was performed with proppant, and almost full fluid recovery was achieved. This result supports the third hypothesis because the proppant would have prevented closure of the fracture near the wellbore but would not have prevented leakoff into the matrix or the natural fracture system.\nBrown et al. [33] proposed that the \u201csnap-off\u201d observed was due to closure of the natural fracture near the wellbore, but it is also plausible that newly propagating natural fractures formed as splays from the opened natural fracture, and the closing natural fracture caused flow restriction that hydraulically isolated the open, newly formed fractures from the wellbore (as shown in Fig. 13 during mixed-mechanism stimulation in simulation C). \nFig. 14 shows a schematic of these processes.\nAki et al. [129] reported the results of cross-borehole seismic experiments at Fenton Hill that investigated the attenuation of waves at different frequencies. They found that the results were most consistent with a \u201chighly complex fracture system consisting of major discrete vertical cracks intersected by several inclined joints\u201d and that the vertical cracks were perpendicular to the minimum principal stress. These results are consistent with the MMS hypothesis (as demonstrated with simulation C) and the interpretations described by Brown [34] and Brown et al. [33]. We hypothesize that the inclined joints were natural fractures and the vertical cracks were newly formed fractures. Aki et al. [129] did not comment at length about the nature of the \u201cvertical cracks\u201d they inferred to exist, but evidently, they believed them to be newly formed. Aki et al. [129] explained \u201cwe use the word \u2018joint\u2019 referring to a naturally originated fracture and the word \u2018crack\u2019 referring to an artificially created fracture. The distinction, however, is not always clear because we sometimes do not know how a fracture originated.\u201d\nRobinson [130] developed a discrete fracture network model of the Fenton Hill phase II reservoir. The model described flow through the network but not the stimulation process itself. Consistent with the conceptual model described above, he designed a model with two sets of predominant joints: one with opening pressure around 10MPa (near the minimum principal stress) and another with opening pressure around 22MPa.\n\n\n4.2.3\nRosemanowes\nPine and Batchelor [6] wrote an influential paper arguing that the downward propagation of microseismicity from the injection wells at Rosemanowes was evidence for shear stimulation. Their argument was based on an analysis showing that the trends in stress and pressure with depth caused the tendency for shear stimulation to increase with depth, while the tendency for tensile fracturing decreased with depth. Therefore, they argued that a newly forming tensile fracture should propagate upwards, but shear stimulation along a natural fracture should propagate downwards.\nMcClure [131] discussed this interpretation of the Rosemanowes data. The data does seem inconsistent with the idea that a single, continuous hydraulic fracture formed. Such a fracture would have tended to propagate upward, and certainly would not have propagated predominantly downward. However, the data does not rule out an MMS interpretation. In the MMS hypothesis, newly forming fractures form into a branching network of flowing fractures that also includes natural fractures. The propagation of such a network would be very sensitive to the randomness of the local fracture network, and in general, spreading of stimulation and microseismicity may occur in any direction.\nMcClure [131] discussed how Pine and Batchelor [6] neglected to consider the effect of pressure gradient away from the well during injection. As long as the fracture transmissivity was not extremely high, there must have been a significant pressure gradient through the formation due to flow. The pressure gradient would have tended to make the propagation of stimulation more symmetrical, because regions of the formation more distant from the well would have lower fluid pressure. According to the stress profile given by Pine and Batchelor [6], the tendency for shear stimulation was increasing only very gradually with depth, around 1.7MPa\/km. Very likely, the pressure gradient due to flow was greater than 1.7MPa\/km, and this should have prevented stress trends alone from controlling the direction of propagation.\nDuring the massive stimulation of RH15 at Rosemanowes, several years after the stimulation described by Pine and Batchelor [6], microseismicity propagated neutrally with respect to depth [132].\n\n\n4.2.4\nProppant\nProppant has not been used widely in EGS projects, but in several cases it has been emplaced successfully. This is relevant because it is probably unlikely that a closed natural fracture, in which the fracture walls are in contact and the aperture is held open only by contacting asperities, could have sufficient aperture to permit significant transport of proppant. Therefore, if natural fractures accept significant volumes of proppant during injection, this suggests that the walls of these fractures separated, and the fracture was \u201copen\u201d. During the same injection test, if axial hydraulic fractures did not form at the wellbore, this would demonstrate that it is possible to open (walls out of contact) natural fractures at the wellbore without forming a new hydraulic fracture at the wellbore.\nAs described in Section 4.2.2, the first EGS experiment with proppant was a small injection into a short isolated interval in 1974 at Fenton Hill [33]. In this experiment, proppant dramatically increased fluid recovery during flowback.\nThe first large EGS experiment with proppant was at the Rosemanowes project in 1989. The injection was performed in RH15, a deeper well drilled after the stimulation of RH12. Bennett and Barker [133] reported that all of the proppant was apparently placed into a single natural fracture intersecting RH15, and that zone subsequently became the dominant zone for production in the well. During a two-well circulation tests with RH15 as the producer, fluid recovery improved from 65% to 90% after the proppant placement [133]. Parker [3] reported that the proppant worsened a thermal short-circuit that had developed in the reservoir previously.\nProppant was placed successfully during the stimulation at Fj\u00e4llbacka [101] and Gro\u03b2 Sh\u00f6nebeck [59]. The Gro\u03b2 Sh\u00f6nebeck project was not included in Table 1 because it was performed partially in a sedimentary formation. In addition, proppant was placed successfully at the Le Mayet project, and subsequently the section of the well stimulated with proppant was observed to be much more productive than the sections that were stimulated only with water [98].\nThe use of wellbore imaging logs and production logs at Rosemanowes and Le Mayet makes clear that the proppant was placed into open natural fractures, not a newly formed axial tensile fracture [98,133]. The investigators at Rosemanowes evidently believed that the proppant placed was placed only in natural fractures, not that any new fracture propagation occurred [3,133]. We hypothesize that because natural fractures intersecting the wellbore opened, new fractures could have initiated from the natural fractures and propagated through the formation (Section 1.5).\n\n\n\n4.3\nImplications of mixed-mechanism stimulation for EGS\nIf significant propagation of new fractures occurs in many or most EGS projects, this would have major implications for the EGS modeling and design. As reviewed in this paper, the great majority of EGS modeling has assumed pure shear stimulation. If significant propagation of new fractures occurs during stimulation, modeling codes need to be updated to include this process.\nMore broadly, consideration of different stimulation mechanisms would open up new possibilities for EGS thinking and design. Which mechanism would be best for economic EGS development: mixed-mechanism or pure shear stimulation? If a particular mechanism was preferred, projects could be located in places with geological conditions that make this mechanism more favorable.\nOptimal stimulation design will depend on the mechanism of stimulation. Therefore, prediction of stimulation mechanism should be a fundamental part of stimulation design and overall project planning. Stimulation designs in EGS are radically different than in oil and gas. One reason for this difference is that high temperatures create unique technical challenges. But another reason is the apparently widespread belief that hydraulic fracturing in EGS is so different that successful techniques from oil and gas should not even be considered.\nProppant has not been used widely in EGS. This is surprising because insufficient well productivity is the most important issue currently preventing broad adoption of EGS, and field experience using proppant in EGS wells has consistently demonstrated increased productivity (Section 4.2.4). Researchers at Rosemanowes blamed proppant placement for worsening short-circuiting [3]. But creating high transmissivity pathways through the reservoir should be viewed as desirable as long as multiple high transmissivity pathways can be developed.\nThere is apparently a widespread belief that the high transmissivity of self-propping fractures in granite should make proppant unnecessary. But not all EGS projects are performed in granite, and fractures in different types of rock may not self-prop as effectively. Field-scale experience with EGS in granite has suggested that self-propping fractures provide adequate, but not spectacular, transmissivity. The project at Soultz has achieved perhaps the highest permeability EGS reservoir to date, probably because it involves flow in large, thick, porous, highly fractured fault zones (a best case scenario for natural fracture transmissivity). Nevertheless, a simple calculation based on a circulation test between the wells GPK2 and GPK3 suggests that the total reservoir transmissivity for flow between the two wells is in the range of 3\u20138\u00d710\u221213\nm3\n[134]. Laboratory experiments (from fractures in other types of rock) suggest that the transmissivity of a single propped fracture can reach 5\u00d710\u221213\nm3, even at modest proppant concentration and effective normal stress of 20MPa or greater [135]. Laboratory results should not be expected to apply directly in the field, but they suggest that more experimentation with proppant in EGS is warranted.\nThere would be challenges associated with finding proppants that can withstand the high pressures, high temperatures, and reactive chemical environments that are found in EGS reservoirs, which is why developing improved proppants should be a major research priority. Recent work suggests that proppant coated with surface-modification agents (SMAs) may be much more resistant to chemical degradation at high temperature than conventional proppants [136].\nLocalization of flow into one or a few discrete zones has been a widespread problem in EGS wells (Table 1). Simulation C demonstrates how localization is encouraged by concentrations of stress ahead of crack tips (both shear and opening) and stress shadows along the sides of opening and shearing fractures.\nThe best solution for preventing thermal short-circuiting would be to use zonal isolation and perform multiple fracture stages in wells drilled in an orientation as close as possible to the minimum principal stress. Increasing the number of pathways for flow would also increase the overall flow rate that could be achieved through the system.\nThere would be challenges associated with building packers that can withstand the high temperatures in EGS, which is why developing high temperature technologies for zonal isolation needs to be a major research priority. The Newberry EGS project recently demonstrated the use of thermally degrading diverters to create zonal isolation [137]. Another possibility is to investigate cased hole techniques, such as \u201cplug and perf\u201d completions. In the past, cemented casing completions have not been considered because the focus on stimulating preexisting fractures has made openhole completions seem mandatory. But cemented casing completions should be considered because they would make zonal isolation during stimulation easier to achieve [138].\nIn development of oil and gas resources from shale and tight sands, the fossil fuel industry has embraced horizontal wells, multiple stages with transverse fractures, and experimentation to optimize proppant selection and pumping strategy [139]. These techniques have been used to enable economic production from huge, low permeability resources. This is also the goal of the EGS community. Modelers of stimulation in shale have begun using a mixed-mechanism stimulation conceptual model [21,23,140]. The EGS community may benefit by adopting these concepts that have been successfully applied in unconventional oil and gas.\nFrom a shear stimulation point of view, it may be argued that EGS projects should attempt to intersect large, thick faults. At projects like Cooper Basin and Soultz, fluid flow has tended to localize into the large faults intersecting the wellbore. This has been demonstrated to be an effective approach, but there may be disadvantages to targeting large, thick faults. Sites with large faults have had the most significant induced seismicity [4,120]. Large faults will tend to be in formations that already have significant natural permeability, leading to significant fluid loss during long term circulation. Finally, shear stimulation will always be inherently dependent on intersecting unpredictable and difficult to detect natural fracture networks and faults.\nAn alternative approach would be designed around the mixed-mechanism concept. The approach would be to seek a site like Fenton Hill, with extremely low initial permeability and without well-developed faults. A horizontal well could be drilled in the direction of the minimum principal stress, and a large number of fracture stages could be performed from a cased well, possibly using proppant and viscous gel. Higher fluid viscosity during stimulation tends to lead to a less complex fracture network [141]. Complexity might be seen as desirable for preventing short-circuiting, but it may not desirable if the goal is to create a single, high transmissivity fracture pathway per stage. Multiple stages would be used to minimize short-circuiting and to improve flow rate by creating an increased number of permeable paths for flow [138,142]. With a large number of stages, well spacing could be reduced, increasing flow rate through the system.\nA second horizontal well could then be drilled near the first, with the location chosen based on the microseismicity in order to maximize the likelihood of a good connection. If proppant was used, it might be ideal to drill the second sell below the first, since proppant will tend to settle downward. The use of a denser fluid may encourage downward propagation of stimulation [143]. If the injection well was deeper, temperature driven density differences would modestly mitigate thermal short-circuiting, especially if the system was steam\/water (though this is less common). It would be especially advantageous to have propped fractures in the vicinity of the production well, where pressure will be lowest.\nDesign parameters such as the separation between the wells, the number of stages, and the stage length would need to be selected to maximizes net present value based on well cost, stimulation cost, system transmissivity, and thermal breakthrough. There would be significant technical challenges to this approach, but this concept represents a path forward for EGS with a clear rational for why it would achieve better economic performance than past designs.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe reviewed stimulation results from ten EGS projects and found that they could be characterized broadly as having: (a) pressure-limiting behavior, (b) flow from discrete zones, and (c) bottomhole pressure greater than the minimum principal stress. It is often assumed that in EGS stimulation occurs through induced slip on preexisting fractures. However, we hypothesize that with the fluid pressure above the minimum principal stress, natural fractures at the wellbore may open, and new fractures may form off them as splays or through extension of the fractures at their tips. This concept (mixed-mechanism stimulation) can reconcile the observation that flow localizes to natural fractures at the wellbore with the observation that fluid pressure tends to exceed the minimum principal stress during injection.\nWe used numerical simulations to demonstrate how pure shear stimulation should only be possible in formations with adequate initial fracture transmissivity, a percolating natural fracture network, and adequate fracture storativity (in addition to the conditions that fractures must be present that are well-oriented to slip and that experience sufficiently increased transmissivity in response to slip).\nWe also used modeling to demonstrate an example of mixed-mechanism stimulation. We investigated how fluid recovery and connectivity could be affected by the presence of multiple fractures with a variety of orientations, as would occur during mixed-mechanism stimulation.\nBetter techniques are needed for diagnosing stimulation mechanism. We suggested three: coring a well through the stimulated region around an EGS well, pressure analysis of shut-in or flowback, and a \u201ctendency for shear stimulation\u201d test (the latter was described in greater detail by McClure and Horne [119]).\nWe reviewed reports from the Fenton Hill EGS project and discussed how observations from that project are consistent with the mixed-mechanism concept. We reviewed how results from injection below the minimum principal stress at the Desert Peak project demonstrate that shear stimulation was only modestly effective at creating stimulation and how injection above the minimum principal stress \u2013 probably causing propagation of new fractures \u2013 was more effective. We provided an alternative interpretation to the arguments made by Pine and Batchelor [6] that the downward propagation of stimulation at Rosemanowes indicates that shear stimulation was occurring, not propagation of new fractures.\nWe discussed potential implications of mixed-mechanism stimulation for development of EGS. According to the mixed-mechanism hypothesis, significant fracture opening and propagation occurs at many EGS projects. This could impact stimulation design, site selection, and modeling and lead to entirely different approaches for EGS design.\n\n","71":"","72":"","73":"","74":"","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nIn the evaluation of the integrity of caprocks, and of analogue seals, the fracture spacing is of vital importance. In proposed CO2 storage sites, it is not the intact matrix of the caprock that causes concern for the retention of the injected CO2 rich fluids, or pure dense phase CO2. Rather, it is the presence of fractures at a series of scales which need to be quantified and analysed in terms of their connectivity and transport properties. During the characterisation of a reservoir for storage, the fluid pressure history and digenetic analysis of the caprock play an important role in understanding how the caprock will react to the presence of increased chemically aggressive fluid pressure loading beneath it. Indeed, the results of Rutqvist et al. [1] illustrate that hydraulic fracturing can be expected in the lower layers of a caprock after a relatively short period of time of fluid injection if the pressure is not controlled properly. It is generally accepted that hydro-fracturing will occur when the pore fluid pressure below the top seal equals or exceeds the minimum horizontal stress plus the tensile strength of the caprock [2].\nHere we present a model that examines the impact of increased fluid pressure in multilayered sedimentary systems, the physical requirements for fluid driven fracturing of the strata in these layered systems, and the horizontal spacing between vertical fractures these systems could show. The model emphasises the importance of the local stress distributions on the formation of the fractures. It can be used to predict the likely fracture patterns of fluid driven (hydro-fracturing) in strata bound systems. A caveat to the model is that the presence of pre-existing fracture sets will influence the distribution of fluid pressure and impact on the predicted spacings. However, the model can be used for a first-order assessment.\n\n1.1\nControls on fracture geometry\nSeveral authors discuss joint formation mechanisms. Here we concentrate on opening mode fractures. The work of Price [3] discusses joint\/fracture development wherever the effective tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the rock. Possible causes being a result of fluid overpressure, expansion of the rock mass under uplift and erosion, pull apart due to tension induced by a regional extension, salt diapirism and folding.\nThere are obviously several mechanisms that will lead to the formation of fractures. The dominant mechanism at any particular time, and the characteristics of the deposit (the packet of sediment and hard rock, including any existing fracturing) will influence the nature of the response of the deposit to the formation of fractures. Depending on the cause of fracturing, the fractures formed will exhibit different geometrical characteristics and be scale dependent.\nBonnet et al. [4] review several methods of scaling fracture systems, including the lognormal distributions, exponential distributions and gamma law distributions, and indicated a recent preference for the fractal approach. They point out that recent studies indicate lithological layering, from the scale of a single bed to the whole crust, is reflected in fracture system properties. This layering influences the scale range over which individual bed specific or fracture system specific scaling laws are valid. The above named distributions are mathematical fits of probability distributions, and to understand the cause of fracturing it is necessary to reference the mechanical constraints and drivers. In certain cases one model, with certain limiting factors, fits better than another, but there is no ubiquitous law to match the whole population of fractures.\nIn a typical geological deposit, several sets of fractures will be present. To understand the spacing of the fractures it is important to understand the mechanisms that have led to the development of the different fracture sets. The observation that lithological layering is reflected in the fracture systems suggests that a process operating at the scale of the lithological bed size is important in controlling the development of the fractures. Identifying the key processes behind fracturing as creating \u201cseparate fracture packets\u201d or end members, will help in the analysis of the fracture spacing and the nature of the process leading to the fracturing.\nHere we concentrate on strata bound fractures as opposed to fractures which cut across several formations, and hypothesise that hydraulic fracturing provides an important controlling mechanism for the development of strata bound fractures. Particularly the stress field developed during dynamic fluid fracturing significantly influences the location of the development of further fractures.\nBai et al. [5] summarised work from many authors to make the observation that \u201cthe fracture spacing in layered sedimentary rocks is roughly proportional to the thickness of the fractured layer, with a ratio of thickness's from less than 0.1 to greater than 10.\u201d They developed a finite element model describing fracture spacing as a result of a pull-apart model, and a transition of stress from one bed to another bed. From the results of this model, they subdivided the fracture spacing to bed thickness ratios into four categories, whereby they could explain two categories with their extensional model and the further two categories where the joint spacing was too tight to have been caused by the extensional mechanism explained. They concluded that the other sets of joint spacing ratios required flaws and fluid pressure to produce the spacing. They note that as the tensile stress increases between two existing fractures, eventually a fracture will be initiated. The location of this new fracture will be dependent on a result of a local heterogeneity, such as a pre-existing zone of weakness, or due to the increase in fluid pressure overcoming compressive strength. Bai et al. [6] note that experimental and field results indicate fracture spacing decreases approximately as the inverse of the applied strain in the direction perpendicular to fractures, by fractures forming between earlier formed fractures. Gross [7] used the term \u201csequential infilling\u201d to describe this process. Bai et al. [5] developed the concept of a maximum fracture saturation distance, being related to the stress distribution caused by the presence of a fracture leading to an area of \u201cstress shielding\u201d and thereby setting a lower limit to possible fracture spacing. The stress shielding is caused by the compressive stress due to vertical shortening of the fractures and the horizontal constraint in the central area between two fractures.\nAddressing multiple layer sequences, Sch\u00f6pfer et al. [8] examined the role of the transfer of extensional stress between different layers, and focussed on the relationship between the tensile strength of an individual bed and the amount of stress that can be transmitted into that bed from adjoining beds as a function of the interface shear strength. The larger the tensile strength, the more tensional stress needs to be transmitted to cause fracturing which is satisfied either through wider fracture spacing or through a higher interface shear strength. Following [8], and the references therein, this is described as Price's model [3]. They show that different extensional models are applicable depending on the ratio of the tensile strength of the bed to the interfacial shear strength; however, the influence of fluid pressure is not addressed.\nBoutt et al. [9] investigated both experimentally and numerically the formation of natural hydraulic fractures. By reducing the external fluid pressure in sandstone samples more rapidly than the internal pressure could equilibrate, they were able to generate hydraulic fractures considered to be a consequence of both the internal fluid pressure exceeding the confining pressure and tensile strength of the rock, and also to be a consequence of a strong pressure gradient existing within the sample. Numerically they were able to simulate this type of depressurisation of the sample and the density of the in filled fractures. The rate of pressure release within the samples is a function of the permeability and storage of the samples. They conclude that the processes they have observed are very important in the natural hydro fracture process found within the earth's crust.\nOdling et al. [10] examined several high-quality data sets of fracture systems from four reservoirs and identified two end member types of fracturing, named as \u201cstrata bound\u201d and \u201cnon strata bound\u201d. They suggest that in strata bound systems there is little mechanical coupling between the layers. The individual joints are confined to single layers, and there is a clear relationship between bed thickness and joint spacing. Such sequences are found in systems with strongly developed interbedded weak and strong layers, e.g. interbedded sandstones, limestones, mudstones and shales. They describe the system as having weak adhesion between the layers. Odling et al. [10] describe strata bound fracture systems as confined to single layers, the sizes are scale restricted and the spacing is regular. We note also from the observation of typical caprock analogues (unpublished in house) that fracturing may at times go slightly beyond the limits of the bed and into more plastic layers, and also that fractures extending only a partial distance in the fractured bed (half fractures) are also present.\nThe role of increased pore fluid pressure within the crust and the link to the development of natural hydraulic fracturing has long been accepted, (e.g. [11,12]), and there are several examples in the literature of natural fracture systems which are interpreted as being a consequence of hydraulic fracturing. The focus of this paper is on strata bound systems and the role of fluid overpressure, and we suggest that it plays a more significant role than previously acknowledged in the formation of strata bound systems.\n\n\n1.2\nParametric controls on hydraulic fracturing\nThere is a large body of literature particularly from the hydrocarbon industry examining the parametric controls on the development of hydraulic fractures in layered sequences. They deal particularly with a localised increase in fluid pressure due to fluid injection in a borehole, as opposed to a more regional increase in fluid pressure as would be the case in burial or a generic build up of pressure under a caprock. The key area of interest of this literature is the prediction of the length of the fractures generated and containment within different layers. There is some discussion as to the transfer of stress between different geological layers, key parameters being addressed include the contrast of the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio between beds. Simonson [13] showed analytically that the effect of different elastic properties should have a very significant control on the vertical development of fractures. However, several authors have shown experimentally that this is not the case in nature. Smith et al. [14] discussed the impact of the modulus in layered sequences and showed that the contrasting modulus did not control growth of the fractures, but that the modulus was very significant in terms of determining the fracture aperture. Fung et al. [15] modelled a layered sequence using both an analytical solution and a numerical model to show that fracture development can be satisfactorily predicted without recourse to the elastic modulus even in cases where the modulus contrasts were a factor of 5. Amongst other authors Van Eekelen [16] came to the conclusion that the minimum stress profile was the key factor in controlling the growth of hydraulic fractures. This is related to the burial profile and Poisson's ratio of individual layers [17]. A number of times, shales have been shown to arrest hydraulic fractures, and it is suggested that this is due to the fact that mudrocks have a higher Poissons ratio than more indurated rocks. This leads locally to a higher minimum principal stress and therefore a higher fluid pressure necessary to cause fracturing. Conversely lower permeability leads to fluid pressures being maintained longer in the beds, and also a lower permeability will reduce fluid pressure drainage and therefore increase the overall fluid pressure in the system. Several authors (e.g. [18,19]) agree that in situ stress contrast is the dominant parameter controlling fracture growth. Warpinski et al. [19] suggest that material property interfaces are shown to have little effect after the examination of a number of large-scale hydraulic fracturing field tests and subsequent excavation.\nThe impact of material property interfaces is shown to be related to the amount of effective normal stress across that interface. This means that at deeper burial depths the system is more likely to be acting as a ridged body than at shallower depths, but still allows for slippage should enough fluid pressure be introduced into the interface zone. Zhang et al. [20] investigate hydraulic fracture propagation across frictional interfaces, and have developed a numerical model allowing the development of off-set fractures.\nA synopsis of the above is that there appears to be a number of competing factors that influence the formation of fracture systems. For hydraulic fractures the key parameters which have been identified in order of importance are firstly the direction and magnitude of the minimum stress within the bed and secondly the tensile strength of the rock. Other important parameters include parameters relating to fluid flow, e.g. permeability and storage coefficient, and parameters relating to the elastic coefficients.\n\n\n1.3\nA simplified hydraulic fracturing model\nHere we suggest that the extensional model provided by [5], amongst other authors, and developed by [8], presents one end member of possible mechanisms leading to bed thickness related fractures, and that a fluid pressure driven model can also provide another end member for these opening mode fractures with similar characteristics.\nAn advantage of a fluid pressure model is that it does not require the complex issues of extensional stress transfer from weaker beds to stronger beds in heterogeneous faulted systems, whilst still providing a method whereby fracture geometry consistent with field observations (e.g. [6,10] and references therein) is predicted.\nHere we present a simplified hydraulic fracturing model based on the elastic interaction of fractures within the same bed. The model does not attempt to reproduce fracture tip stresses and predict the development of fracture pathways at a grain scale, rather at a larger scale it uses a simple pressure criteria to allow the development of a fracture within a bed as a function of the tensile strength of the material and the minimum principle stress. We assume that this fracture is fluid filled and do not at this stage try to represent transient flow conditions. Likewise at this stage the possible plastic and creep deformation to accommodate stress is not included, and is considered of secondary importance to the short-term stress distribution assumed in this model. This is because elastic response is not time dependent, plastic response is time dependent. The fractures are more or less confined to the strata beds as seen in strata bound systems; however, we assume that there is significant transfer of stress within the beds due to the pressurising of the fractures. In this way we integrate the main characteristics noted in the literature as controlling fracture development. To calculate the transfer of stress within the layered sedimentary system we apply two separate methods, an analytical approach and a numerical model and compare their results.\nAlthough the model is a simplified representation of reality, it predicts and is validated by the main characteristics of strata bound fractures discussed in the extensive body of field observations in the literature cited above (e.g. [6,10] and references therein). The model also predicts, under the right loading conditions, the formation of synchronous orthogonal fracture systems. The formation of orthogonal fractures makes the model suggested here distinct from a pull-apart model. By normalising the relationships found in the model we are able to suggest a standard relationship to be expected from hydraulic influenced fractures dependent on the bed thickness and the tensile strength of the rock.\nIt is reasonable to assume that during the normal digenetic development of a sediment, flexing and burial, both pull apart and hydraulic fracturing models will be applicable, and reinforcing one another.\n\n\n\n2\nHydraulic fracturing in strata-bound systems\nFluid pressure build up will occur naturally during the development of a multilayered sedimentary deposit as a result of burial and compression, a fluid charge from a deeper source or sudden settlement events such as ongoing tectonic activity. For burial to cause a sustained fluid overpressure, fluid migration in the layers needs to be restrained due to lower permeability layers. A stack of sediments will typically comprise sandstones, mudstones and siltstones. The model we present shows that the local minimum horizontal stress in the beds, the difference in the tensile strength of the beds, the difference in the permeability of the beds and the difference in the thicknesses of the beds are controlling factors behind the development of the strata bound fracture systems, the parameters thereof influencing the density of the fractures.\nWe start by postulating a simplified sedimentary sequence as a cut out from a typical multilayered sequence (\nFig. 1). The sequence is saturated, and from base to top, there is a permeable sandstone or carbonate rock (maybe a reservoir rock), above this are two less permeable layers, whereby the tensile strength of the lower bed is less than the tensile strength of the upper bed, for instance the lower bed may be a mudstone, the upper bed a siltstone. The lower tensile stress bed has fractured normal to the minimum principal stress direction, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n. Possible mechanisms for this are discussed below, but for now what is important is consideration of the impact a fracture in this layer will have on the development of the local stress field in response to further hydrostatic pressure increase.\nIf higher pressure fluid is injected into the newly formed fractures, the geometry of the fractures will cause them to exert the hydrostatic pressure within them normal to the fracture walls. The key behind the stress influence of the fractures on each other is the ability of the fracture wall to act as a load bearing surface in relation to the influx of extra fluid and increase in pressure within the fracture. The lower the permeability of the fracture walls (being in a low permeability deposit) the higher the load will be that is sustained and applied throughout the matrix, and the more localised the impact of the higher fluid pressure. In contrast in a higher permeability matrix the extra fluid pressure in the fracture will quickly be transferred to the matrix and be seen as a pore pressure increase.\nThe increase in fluid pressure in the fracture exerts a directional compressive stress on the bed normal to the fracture wall. This causes the development of a stress field represented by the Boussinesq bulbs of pressure [21] sketched in Fig. 1. As the fluid pressure continues to rise eventually a new fracture will propagate in the area of least horizontal stress development and depending on heterogeneities present, the most likely location being halfway between the existing fractures. This is because the \u201cbulbs of pressure\u201d dissipate the loading over an ever-increasing volume with distance from the extra (fluid pressure on fracture wall) loading.\nAt the location where a new fracture will be formed, the pore pressure is being driven from the shortest drainage path, either from the bed itself due to compaction or from the fluid source coming through the layer either above or below it. For the existing (vertical) fracture, the increase in fluid pressure is working against the fracture walls to increase the amount of horizontal stress in the bed. The extra compression due to the fracture loading works against the increased expansive force of the fluid pressure at the location where the new fracture is to be formed (and all other locations in the bed). The two forces are not equal however, due to the distribution of stress from the fracture wall, eventually the expansive force at the location of the new fracture overrides the minimum horizontal tectonic stress, the compressive force of the existing fractures and the tensile strength of the bed. This causes the formation of a new fracture normal to the minimum horizontal stress. As noted in the literature, e.g. [16], the key control on the location of the formation of the fracture is the local variation in the minimum principal stress.\n\n2.1\nConditions causing hydro-fracturing\nThe initial fluid pressure \n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n(Pa) necessary to first open a fracture of the individual layers of tensile strength \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n (Pa) in a confining stress field of \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n(Pa) can be given as a first approximation as\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\nthat is to cause a tensile fracture to develop both the confining stress and the tensile strength of the rock need to be overcome. If the fluid pressure exceeds this value then a tensile fracture must develop. The effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ne\n\n\n (Pa) is given by\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n\u2212\nu\n\n\n\n\nThe detailed small-scale mechanism by which the fracture propagates through the concentration of stress at the fracture tip, and the exploitation of various heterogeneities and other weaknesses in the rock is outside the scope of this paper. What we consider is the fact that at a larger scale, a fracture will develop generally normal to the minimum principle stress once the tensile strength of the rock and the minimum principle stress has been exceeded.\nIn a draining medium the amount of effective stress is a measure of the amount of drainage occurred. In the case where u is increasing the effective stress becomes tensile, and failure occurs where it exceeds the absolute value \n|\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n|\n. The permeability of a bed influences the rate of the change in effective stress proportional to the drainage path length. In simplistic terms the fluid is either trying to get out of the bed (drain) or make space for itself.\nFollowing Terzaghi [22], if the fluid pressure is caused by compaction of the fracturing bed then the higher fluid pressures are likely to be developed in the centre of the layer, as this has the longest drainage path to the higher permeability zones. Should the fluid be a charge, assumed from underneath, then we envisage the highest fluid pressure at the start of the fracturing located at the contact of the fracturing rock with the reservoir rock. We note that during compaction the fracturing layer could be above or below the reservoir layer.\nOnce the fracturing is initiated, it propagates normal to the least principal stress, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n. Fluid migrates into the fracture developing in the caprock until the fracture reaches the overlying layer of higher tensile strength and possibly different local \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n. At this point the fluid in the fracture is at a higher pressure than the fluid in the surrounding matrix of the fracturing layer and at a higher pressure than the fluid in the confining layer. Drainage of this pressure occurs both through the overlying layer and into the fracturing layer depending on the relative permeabilities of these layers to each other, and the rate of recharge of the fracture fluid. Should there be a rapid rate of recharge then a higher pressure in the fracture can be expected and vice versa.\nFor the model, what is important is that the confining layer (Caprock facies II) retains a higher pressure than is required to fracture the fracturing layer (Caprock facies I). The confining layer does not fail until even more fluid pressure is applied.\nOnce a fracture has been developed in the fracturing layer, this fracture exerts the fluid pressure normal to the least principal stress. For the case where there is a fluid charge from beneath, vertically there is no differential stress seen in the fracturing layer as we assume the plan view extent to the layer is significantly more than the thickness of the layer. If the sequence is mechanically restrained vertically then the increase in the horizontal stress as a result of the increase in the fluid pressure \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\u0394\nu\n\n\n (Pa) is given by\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\u0394\nu\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c5\n(\n1\n+\n\u03c5\n)\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c5\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u0394\nu\n\n\nwhere \n\u03c5\n is Poissons ratio, with \n\u0394\nu\n being the increase in the fluid pressure in the reservoir layer which we assume pushes the fracturing layer, but does not enter the fracturing layers matrix, i.e. the layer is compressed. If the strata are not mechanically restrained vertically, then some uplift will occur without a significant increase in the vertical stress. Including the effect of this uplift on \n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n, and allowing \n\u03d6\n=\n\u03c5\n(\n1\n+\n\u03c5\n)\n\/\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c5\n\n2\n\n we can write\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n+\n\u03d6\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is we assume that the confining stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n comprises all rock mechanical contributions. To cause the rock to fracture we need to exceed \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n by an increase in fluid pressure equivalent to \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n. As per Eq. (3) this increase in fluid pressure will express itself in an increase in the confining pressure by \n\u03d6\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n assuming vertical restraint, therefore the term \n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n needs to accommodate this. In the case where there is no vertical restraint the term \n\u03d6\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n is not applied as we assume simple uplift. We introduce the term \nr\n as a value between 0 and 1 to indicate the degree to which vertical restraint is applied. For a completely restrained system \nr\n=\n1\n, for a totally free moving system \nr\n=\n0\n. For ease later we define the pressure above the minimum principal stress for fracture formation \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n to be\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n+\nr\n\u03d6\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the point of fracturing we have higher fluid pressure in the fracture than in the fracturing layer. This will equilibrate with time, the rate being dependent on the permeability of the bed, and if we allow some mechanical pore deformation then it is also inversely proportional to the storage of the bed, the combined effect being the pressure diffusivity, e.g. [9,23]. At the edges of the area if there is little constraint on the layer, plastic and elastic strain accommodation of stress will occur. Outside of the boundary region this release is not available; therefore, there is an increase in the least principal stress experienced by the fracturing rock.\nThe increase in the least principal stress caused by the loading of the fracture walls by the fluid pressure is fundamental to the location of the development of the fractures. We compare both an analytical solution and a numerical solution to evaluate the distribution of stress under this fluid loading (bulbs in Fig. 1).\n\n\n2.2\nThe effect of vertical fractures on the horizontal stress distribution\nIntegrating the Boussinesq [21] equation for a point load, e.g. [24], it is possible to obtain a number of elastic solutions for different geometrical conditions. For an analytical solution, referring to \nFig. 2, we approximate the fracture which has been developed in the fracturing layer as an infinite strip foundation with a width of 2B (\nFig. 3) exerting pressure normal to the strip, in the fracture case normal to the fracture wall. The standard solution and geometrical arrangement for the elastic solution of this stress field development for a semi-infinite layer are presented in Fig. 3\n[25].\nWhen applying the Boussinesq approach, the elastic modulus is taken as not having a significant impact on the stress distribution. As discussed in the Introduction, several authors show that contrasting moduli introduce minor quantitative differences in fracture spacing. In applying this strip solution we are interested only in the stress distribution, and assume full transfer of stress between the individual layers. Also we assume that there is a smooth frictionless contact between the fluid pressure in the fracture and the matrix, and that the side of the walls of the fracture is flexible and detached from one another.\nThe semi-infinite layer assumption suggests that the stress seen at the fracture will be seen in some way throughout the whole of the fracturing layer. As a first assumption this method is useful in understanding the distribution of stress in the fracturing layer, and the principle of stress superposition can be applied for subsequent fractures. However, to take into account that fractures in the fracturing layer will be developing parallel to each other and significantly influencing each other the closer they are together, it is necessary to select an analytical solution that encompasses this.\nThe increase in horizontal pressure as a result of the increase in vertical stress via Poisson's ratio is considered ubiquitous as the horizontal area of the bed is assumed significantly more than the thickness of the bed. Therefore, this stress increase will not be dissipated. However, to calculate the dissipation of the increase in horizontal stress caused by the loading at the fracture walls we apply a coupled processes finite element simulator, \u201cOpenGeoSys\u201d [26] and also use an analytical solution developed by Poulos [27] for a foundation underlain by an adhesive rigid base. The numerical model solved by OpenGeoSys is a standard elastic solution [28]. Although the approximation of the adhesive base in the analytical solution is incorrect, it is interesting to note the similarity between the numerical solution and the analytical solution. This indicates that the key processes have been addressed.\nIn foundation engineering numerous authors have used the symmetry of the elastic solutions to produce dimensionless relationships between the size of the bearing surfaces and various quantities located in the elastic half space such as directionally orientated stress or strain. Often given an initial loading of the bearing surface the quantity required is given by multiplying the initial loading value by an \u201cInfluence Factor\u201d \nI\n. Poulos et al. [25] contains several examples of this approach, behind the influence factor is the spatial integration of the Boussinesq [21] equation for a point load, which then enables the ratio of the initial loading to the value required at a point located in the elastic half space to be calculated. For analytical solutions, as the stresses and strains can be superimposed various standard solutions for rectangles, or strip loading, and points under corners or under the middle can be combined to provide ready access to required variables, e.g. [29].\nHere we use the approach of using a numerical model that satisfies all the mechanical balance equations for the elastic solution, and an approximate analytical solution to calculate the influence factor of loading on the fractures, and the impact this will have on the minimum principal stress.\nThe analytical solution used is for the stress increase with depth (z) under the corner of a strip foundation upon a finite layer of thickness (h) underlain by a rigid base [27]. The rigid base is taken as the point of meeting of the influence of two fractures on each other, acting as a rigid base (see Fig. 2). Strictly this is incorrect as the stress fields will superimpose on each other and there will be stress and strain developed normal to the minimum principal stress. This is accounted for in the numerical model used.\nWe approximate the influence factor for the analytical solution \n\n\nI\n\n\ns\nt\n\n\n shown in \nFig. 4 as a polynomial function of B\/h, and then estimate the increase in stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n as a result of the additional fluid pressure loading \n(\n\u0394\nu\n)\n on the fracture following [27] as:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nI\n\n\ns\nt\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nu\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numerical modelling approach is illustrated in \nFig. 5. As discussed above the results can be presented in a dimensionless form. A high-density mesh (circa 32,000 elements) was used to represent the geometric space between two fractures. The boundaries of the mesh were far enough away from the interacting fractures so as to assume that the boundary conditions were negligible. The fractures were loaded as flexible sections with fluid pressure and the finite element scheme used to solve the elastic equations within the mesh. The edges of the mesh were set such that no movement in the y direction was possible, only the fracture faces were allowed to deform, and the fractures were not allowed to extend into the surrounding beds. The stress developed in the y direction in this model then represented the increase in horizontal stress. The stress at points P1 and P2 (Fig. 5a) was then used to evaluate the behaviour of the system and derive a function for the influence factor both in the middle of the bed and at the edge of the bed. For the centre of the bed substituting B\/h with \nx\n the influence factor \nI\n for the numerical solution was found to be\n\n(7)\n\nI\n=\n\u2212\n0.0313\n\n\nx\n\n5\n\n+\n0.3039\n\n\nx\n\n4\n\n\u2212\n1.0394\n\n\nx\n\n3\n\n+\n1.3443\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n+\n0.0393\nx\n+\n0.0015\n\nfor\n\n0\n\u2264\nx\n\u2264\n2\n\n\n\n\nIn this case and following we evaluated the influence factor such that\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n=\nI\n\u0394\nu\n\n\n\n\nBoth the imperfect analytical models and the numerical model predict that the stress seen at the edge of the bed will be less than the stress increase seen in the centre of the bed, an important fact we will readdress later.\nUsing the influence factor we find that the most likely position for another fracture to develop will be halfway between two existing fractures, as per sequential infilling observed in the field. The influence existing fractures have upon the minimum principal stress between them can be calculated, and therefore the fluid pressure required to cause hydro-fracturing and the generation of a new fracture at this location can be evaluated.\n\n\n2.3\nDynamic system\nAs fluid pressure is building up at the base of the layer undergoing hydro-fracturing, so also the fluid pressure is increasing in the fractures within this layer which have already formed. This leads to a dynamic system illustrated in \nFig. 6.\nIllustrating this, let us assume that we require an overpressure of 1MPa (we call this value \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n), to cause the first tensile fracturing uninfluenced by surrounding fractures (illustrated in Fig. 6). This pressure we call \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n (where s (set)=1 being the first set of fractures to form) is the fluid pressure required to cause the first set of fractures, initiated due to the heterogeneities in the rock at random weak locations in addition to the in situ minimum principal stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n. If we assume that the minimum principal stress is 10MPa, from (4), assuming that we allow uplift, i.e. no vertical restraint so that \n\u03d6\n=\n0\n, we know that \n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n11\n\nMPa\n. Therefore,\n\n(9)\n\n\u0394\nu\n=\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first set \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n. Should the pressure now remain at 11MPa, we can predict the extra pressure now required to cause the next set of fracturing \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n, being 1MPa (\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n), plus the extra horizontal stress across the location where the next fracture set is to be formed which is evaluated as \nI\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n (arrow 1 in Fig. 6), plus \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n. Let us speculate that this value is 1.1MPa \n(\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n+\nI\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n)\n plus \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n. Should the fluid pressure now increase to 1.1MPa (arrow 2 in Fig. 6) plus \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n, we need to take account of the fact that the 0.1MPa increase in pressure in the fractures will also have a further compressive effect across the new fracture location, arrow 3 in Fig. 6. This can also be evaluated as in Eq. (8), however, we note that we now have a dynamic system, where the local minimum principal stress across the new fracture location is increasing with the fluid pressure increase in the existing fractures. The pressure \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n in addition to \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n required for a new fracture \nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n to form can be expressed as a power series\n\n(10)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n+\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\nI\n+\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n2\n\n\u22ef\n+\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\nwhich is a convergent geometrical series as long as \nI\n\u2264\n1\n, expressed as\n\n(11)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nn\n=\n0\n\n\nn\n=\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sum of a convergent geometrical series is given by\n\n(12)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual real pressure \np\n for the formation of the fracture set s+1 is given by\n\n(13)\n\n\n\np\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nI\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the pressure has been reached for the next set of fractures to infill, \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n the pressure for the following set of infilling fractures can be evaluated as s=2.\nTo include the effect of the vertical stress developed if the strata sequence is mechanically restrained vertically, the horizontally induced component of the vertical stress is calculated as in Eq. (3). We set the first tensile stress fracture of the layer at a defined value as per Eq. (1), and assume that \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n in the layer at this moment contains all the resolved stress components. Further increases in the fluid pressure in the underlying rock now act also to uplift and further compress the fracturing rock, leading to an increase in the horizontal compression. This is included in Eq. (10) as follows:\n\n(14)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n+\n\n\u2211\n\nn\n=\n1\n\n\nn\n=\n\u221e\n\n\n\n(\n1\n+\n\u03d6\n)\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain using the sum of a convergent geometrical series this can be expressed as\n\n(15)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n+\n\n\n(\n1\n+\n\u03d6\n)\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\nI\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor graphical representation this equation can be normalised against \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n, Eq. (5), and values of \nI\n calculated as a function of \nB\n\/\nh\n, such that\n\n(16)\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n(\n1\n+\n\u03d6\n)\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nI\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe select a distance such that \nI\n\u2248\n0\n, e.g. 1024\u00d7bed thickness, and assume at this distance that for the first open fracture set \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n. The actual value of \nI\n is calculated and the equation solved for the value \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n\n(\n\ns\n+\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n, this being the pressure additional to \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n required to cause a fracture halfway between two existing fractures to open, i.e. fracture set s+1.

Repeating this procedure for the interval for which the fitted function of \nI\n is valid allows the construction of \nFig. 7.\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\nThe evaluation of the impact of bed thickness and fracture spacing can be normalised against \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n and the ratio of bed thickness to distance to the next fracture to provide a standard relationship, (16). This is given in Fig. 7a for the numerical solution and Fig. 7b for the approximate analytical solution.\nThe curves presented in Fig. 7a can be used in a graphical fashion to determine pressure and spacing relationships. For a more quantitative approach these curves have been fitted such that for the y=f(x) relationship\n\n(17)\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n=\nE\n+\nA\n\n\ne\n\n\n(\n\u2212\nB\nx\n)\n\n\n+\nC\n\n\ne\n\n\n(\n\u2212\nD\nx\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the inverse x=f(y) relationship\n\n(18)\n\nx\n=\nA\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\nB\n\n)\n\nC\n\n\n\nwhere x is the fracture spacing\/bed thickness. Parameters and validity range are given in \nTable 1. The accuracy of these curves is presented in \nFig. 8.\nAs an example, let us say we want to evaluate the fluid pressure required to create strata bound fractures at a spacing of 20m in a bed with a thickness of 2m. Let us postulate that the tensile strength of the bed is 5MPa, and that there is an overlying bed with a higher tensile strength, and low enough permeability to cause the necessary pressure build up in the bed we are looking at.\nThe bed thickness to fracture spacing ratio is 10, therefore from Fig. 7a or Eq. (17) the fluid pressure to tensile strength ratio is circa 1.03. This means that the fluid pressure required is then the tensile strength of the bed 5MPa multiplied by 1.03, giving 5.15MPa plus the horizontal stress.\nComparing Fig. 7a and b shows that although the two solutions do not provide identical results, the main features of the behaviour have been captured. The numerical solution more closely satisfies the boundary conditions and the distribution of stress within the model and is taken as to be the preferred curve. It is apparent that the distribution of stress within the models is the key feature for the development of the fracturing location.\nIt is interesting also to note that the elastic modulus is not included in the development of the stress field due to loading in analytical solutions [21,27]. This is reflected in the numerical model. The impact of Poisson's ratio on the stress field during the uplift caused by the fluid pressure and local changes in the minimal principal stress is estimated as described above in Eq. (16) and presented in \nFig. 9.\nGiven the limited divergence due to possible differences in Poissons ratio and also the similarity between the mathematically correct numerical model and the approximate analytical solution used, the relationship described seems to be fairly robust. The processes it illustrates can be applied to understand a number of phenomena.\nThe difference between the fluid pressure required to fracture the centre of the bed, and that required to fracture the edge of the bed, is minimal until the spacing is reduced to about four times the bed thickness. This suggests that fractures that do not fully transect the bed will develop in the later stages of fracturing at higher pressures.\nAs fluid pressure increases, we note that the horizontal stresses should be of a similar size, as may be expected during early burial, that it is possible to fracture the systems orthogonally. Differences in \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n would be reflected in the spacing of the fracture sets.\n\n\nFig. 10 demonstrates the development of fracturing with a fracture spacing to bed ratio of down to circa 1.5. If we postulate the tensile strength of the bed fracturing is 1MPa, then the layer causing the pressure build up in this case has a tensile strength of at least 2.5MPa, illustrated in Fig. 10 at 3.6MPa. As the fluid pressure increases the degree of heterogeneity in the fracturing layer will determine initially the location of the first sets of fractures (moving on Fig. 10 from right to left along the bottom). However, as soon as the difference caused by the heterogeneity is less than the stress superposition of the fracture systems, the general heterogeneity will play less of a determining role in the location of the fractures. Obviously the presence of already existing fractures and other significant planes of weakness may dominate the location of all the fracturing. From Fig. 7a, it can be seen that the influence of stress interference becomes more significant under a strata bound fracture spacing of circa 20 bed thicknesses.\nFollowing again as the pressure increases so the next four sets of sequential infilling fractures arise until the fluid pressure for the next smallest set of fractures exceeds the tensile strength of the confining layer.\nThe spacing and therefore the number of fractures within a bed will be a function of the relative tensile strength of the bed in comparison to the other beds within the stratigraphic sequence. As soon as the fluid pressure has been able to rupture the confining layer, hydraulic fracturing in that bed will stop until a higher pressure can be retained.\nThis means for more general observations there will be no hard and fast rule for the spacing of fractures as a function of the tensile strength, rather in a sequence the lower tensile strength deposits will be more densely fractured, and in sequences with high amounts of tensile strength variability this will be reflected in the increased variability of the strata bound fracture spacing.\nIf for a given fluid pressure (\n\n\np\n\n\ng\n\n\n) an estimate of the expected fracture spacing for a bed is to be evaluated, first the horizontal stress confining stress component is removed\n\n(19)\n\n\n\nu\n\n\ng\n\n\n=\n\n\np\n\n\ng\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondly the fluid pressure \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n is calculated for the bed (5) and the pressure \n\n\nu\n\n\ng\n\n\n is normalised (divided by) \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n. Third using Eq. (16) and the relationship illustrated in Fig. 7a, the bed thickness to fracture spacing ratio is determined by setting \n\n\nu\n\n\nf\n(\ns\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\/\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\n\ng\n\n\n\/\n\n\nu\n\n\nf\nf\n\n\n and reading of the graph, or using Eq. (18). Fourth this is converted to a real number by multiplying by the bed thickness.\nAs discussed previously the key behind the stress influence of the fractures on each other is the ability of the fracture wall to act as a load bearing surface in relation to the influx of extra fluid into the fracture and the matrix when fluid is present within it to act under hydrostatic stress. If, due to the high permeability of the bed, the fracture wall is not able to act as a load bearing surface the process will be arrested, and therefore there will be less control on the location of new fractures. This suggests that there should be more variability seen in the spacing of strata bound fractures within higher permeability deposits than within lower permeability deposits once normalised against the bed thickness and the tensile strength of the rock.\nAdditionally the amount of fluid pressure generated in the sedimentary profile will also be a function of the rate of the source supply, the permeability of the individual beds and their thickness. Allowing normal Darcy flow, the amount of flow is a linear function of both the pressure gradient and the permeability. Therefore, if a source is defining how much flow there is to be through a system, this will define the pressure gradient in the system as a function of the contrasting permeabilities of the beds to each other. The pressure gradient across a bed is a linear function of its permeability and an inverse function of its thickness. Therefore, the thicker a bed and the lower its permeability the higher the pressure will be necessary to sustain a constant flow rate. In a source term driven system, the source term is forcing fluid through a sequence and if the rate of the source term increases then the pressure gradient has to increase to accommodate this. This increase in pressure could be enough to trigger the hydraulic fracturing described above.\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nWe identify the hydro-fracturing process as one possible mechanism for tensile fracture development and present a model for investigating the characteristics of tensile fracturing driven by fluid pressure increase in multilayered sedimentary systems. The model allows the derivation of a standard normalised rule applicable to all strata bound systems. We suggest that both extension and fluid pressure-fracturing can operate during a normal digenetic burial process. We also conclude that the fluid pressure model presented here will better explain certain features seen such as orthogonal fracturing. This model will also be applicable during larger scale engineered fluid injection into reservoirs under caprocks.\nThe model predicts that strata bound fracture systems will follow a standard curve during hydraulic fracturing which can be used to determine the pressures of fracturing as a function of the spacing of the factures and the tensile strengths of the beds. The key feature of the model is the interaction of fractures with one another, the buildup in fluid pressure and the tensile strength of the individual layer. The stress superposition caused by the fluid pressure loading in the fractures coupled with the heterogeneities in the beds defines the development of the spacing of the fractures. The model predicts that the following factors will be related to the spacing of the strata bound fractures, given below and summarised in \nFig. 11.\n\nFirst the bed thickness: this is directly related to the fracture spacing, as the thickness of the bed acts as the length of the load bearing surface which defines how far the effects of the fluid pressure increase at the fracture walls is transmitted into the bed fracturing.\n\nSecond the permeability: the higher the permeability of a bed, the more varied the possible fracture spacing, as with increasing permeability the fracture walls will act less efficiently as load bearing surfaces, spreading the fluid load distribution within the matrix and thereby increasing possible fracture spacing. Also the variability in the contrasting degree of permeability within the system will be related to the fluid pressure profile in the system. The larger the range in permeability the more there is the possibility of a low permeability layer causing fluid pressure to increase beneath it.\n\nThird the bed thickness variability: the variability in the contrasting degree of bed thicknesses within the system, particularly the lower permeability beds will control the fluid pressure profile in the system. Thick low permeability beds will allow the buildup of higher fluid pressure them it.\n\nFourth the rate of source: the larger the rate of fluid charge, the less variability there will be in fracture spacing because the fluid pressure does not have as long to dissipate into the matrix before fracturing occurs. The larger the rate of the source the more efficiently the fracture walls will act as load bearing surfaces.\n\nFifth the tensile strength of the beds: the variability in the contrasting degree of tensile strength within the system (high tensile strength of beds will reduce fracture density, a high tensile strength bed of low permeability will cause the beds under it to hydro fracture)\nSixth the size of the local principal horizontal stresses will define whether parallel or orthogonal fracturing will occur, and their relative spacing.\nAdditionally the model predicts that there is a minimum fracture spacing, however combined with an extensional regime fracture spacing can be reduced. Finally the model also provides an explanation for fractures which extend only partially through a bed, and suggests that they are formed at later stages and higher fluid pressures. Also in agreement with other work the model suggests that the elastic moduli (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) have little impact on the fracture spacing.\n\n","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":""},"Creator":{"0":["Kim, Kwang-Il","Yoo, Hwajung","Park, Sehyeok","Yim, Juhyi","Xie, Linmao","Min, Ki-Bok","Rutqvist, Jonny"],"1":["Huang, Xiao","Xu, Nuwen","Wu, Wei","Xiao, Peiwei","Dong, Linlu","Li, Biao"],"2":["Wu, Lizhou","Zhou, Jianting","Luo, Lin","Yang, L.P."],"3":["Fan, Zhanfeng","Zhang, Jichun","Xu, Hua","Wang, Xu"],"4":["Zhao, Jian","Konietzky, Heinz"],"5":["Bao, Ting","Burghardt, Jeff","Gupta, Varun","White, Mark"],"6":["Wei, Chunchen","Zhang, Chengguo","Canbulat, Ismet","Huang, Wanpeng"],"7":["Schwartzkopff, Adam K.","Sainoki, Atsushi","Elsworth, Derek"],"8":["Ji, Yinlin","Yoon, Jeoung Seok","Zang, Arno","Wu, Wei"],"9":["Wang, Hongwei","Shi, Ruiming","Song, Jiaqi","Tian, Zheng","Deng, Daixin","Jiang, Yaodong"],"10":["Abe, Ayaka","Kim, Tae Wook","Horne, Roland N."],"11":["An, Mengke","Zhang, Fengshou","Dontsov, Egor","Elsworth, Derek","Zhu, Hehua","Zhao, Luanxiao"],"12":["Chen, Tuo","Mitri, Hani S."],"13":["Lei, Qinghua","Loew, Simon"],"14":["Ju, Minghe","Li, Xiaofeng","Li, Jianchun"],"15":["Shiu, Wenjie","Guglielmi, Yves","Graupner, Bastian","Rutqvist, Jonny"],"16":["Mngadi, S.B.","Tsutsumi, A.","Onoe, Y.","Manzi, M.S.D.","Durrheim, R.J.","Yabe, Y.","Ogasawara, H.","Kaneki, S.","Wechsler, N.","Ward, A.K.","Naoi, M.","Moriya, H.","Nakatani, M."],"17":["van den Bogert, P.A.J.","van Eijs, R.M.H.E."],"18":["Harper, Tim"],"19":["Rutqvist, Jonny","Graupner, Bastian","Guglielmi, Yves","Kim, Taehyun","Ma\u00dfmann, Jobst","Nguyen, Thanh Son","Park, Jung-Wook","Shiu, Wenjie","Urpi, Luca","Yoon, Jeoung Seok","Ziefle, Gesa","Birkholzer, Jens"],"20":["Jin, Zirou","Talukdar, Mayukh","Sone, Hiroki"],"21":["Kluge, Christian","Bl\u00f6cher, Guido","Barnhoorn, Auke","Bruhn, David"],"22":["Huang, Feng","Wu, Chuangzhou","Ni, Pengpeng","Wan, Guoqing","Zheng, Aichen","Jang, Bo-An","Karekal, Shivakumar"],"23":["Park, Jung-Wook","Guglielmi, Yves","Graupner, Bastian","Rutqvist, Jonny","Kim, Taehyun","Park, Eui-Seob","Lee, Changsoo"],"24":["Jia, Yunzhong","Wu, Wei","Kong, Xiang-Zhao"],"25":["Kenigsberg, Abby R.","Rivi\u00e8re, Jacques","Marone, Chris","Saffer, Demian M."],"26":["Chen, Yi-Feng","Liao, Zhen","Zhou, Jia-Qing","Hu, Ran","Yang, Zhibing","Zhao, Xian-Jin","Wu, Xing-Liang","Yang, Xu-Lie"],"27":["Hettema, Marc"],"28":["Shen, Baotang","Duan, Yi","Luo, Xun","van de Werken, Matt","Dlamini, Bongani","Chen, Lu","Vardar, Onur","Canbulat, Ismet"],"29":["Han, Dongya","Li, Kaihui","Meng, Jingjing"],"30":["Petru\u017e\u00e1lek, M.","Jechumt\u00e1lov\u00e1, Z.","\u0160\u00edlen\u00fd, J.","Kol\u00e1\u0159, P.","Svitek, T.","Lokaj\u00ed\u010dek, T.","Turkov\u00e1, I.","Kotrl\u00fd, M.","Onysko, R."],"31":["Ju, Yang","Wan, Changbing","Ren, Zhangyu","Mao, Lingtao","Fu, Guoming","Chiang, Fu-pen"],"32":["Kring, Katelyn","Chatterjee, Snehamoy"],"33":["Cheng, Guanwen","Li, Lianchong","Zhu, Wancheng","Yang, Tianhong","Tang, Chunan","Zheng, Yun","Wang, Yue"],"34":["Birkholzer, Jens T.","Tsang, Chin-Fu","Bond, Alexander E.","Hudson, John A.","Jing, Lanru","Stephansson, Ove"],"35":["Li, Ziyan","Elsworth, Derek","Wang, Chaoyi","Im, Kyungjae"],"36":["Yaghoubi, Ali"],"37":["Valley, Beno\u00eet","Evans, Keith F."],"38":["Ma, Ju","Dong, Longjun","Zhao, Guoyan","Li, Xibing"],"39":["Pontes, Cayo C.C.","Nogueira, Francisco C.C.","Bezerra, Francisco H.R.","Balsamo, Fabrizio","Miranda, Tiago S.","Nicchio, Matheus A.","Souza, Jorge A.B.","Carvalho, Bruno R.B.M."],"40":["Wang, Xin","Qin, Yi","Yin, Zhaohui","Zou, Lejun","Shen, Xiaohua"],"41":["Yang, Sheng-Qi","Yin, Peng-Fei","Zhang, Yuan-Chao","Chen, Miao","Zhou, Xiao-Ping","Jing, Hong-Wen","Zhang, Qiang-Yong"],"42":["Rajmeny, Pramod","Shrimali, Rajeev"],"43":["Khademian, Zoheir","Ugur, Ozbay"],"44":["Hassani, Hossein","Hlou\u0161ek, Felix","Alexandrakis, Catherine","Buske, Stefan"],"45":["McLaskey, Gregory C.","Lockner, David A."],"46":["Sato, Minoru","Takemura, Takato","Takahashi, Manabu"],"47":["Lu, Cai-Ping","Liu, Yang","Zhang, Nong","Zhao, Tong-Bin","Wang, Hong-Yu"],"48":["Tang, Y.","Ranjith, P.G."],"49":["Shalev, Eyal","Lyakhovsky, Vladimir"],"50":["Liu, Richeng","Li, Bo","Yu, Liyuan","Jiang, Yujing","Jing, Hongwen"],"51":["Sun, Zhuang","Espinoza, D.

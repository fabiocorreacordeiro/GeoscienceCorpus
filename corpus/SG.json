A particular difficulty lies in identifying cases where petrographic and geochemical attributes of dolostone related to one mechanism could be obscured by a later, different one. To better understand whether traditional approaches are sufficient to unravel the origins of dolostone resulting from successive, different mechanisms, this study investigates the formation mechanism(s) of dolostone along a platform-to-basin transect of a Permian-Triassic isolated platform in the Nanpanjiang Basin. The dolostone in the Lower Triassic succession comprises three dolomite phases that can be distinguished through field relationships, petrography, 87Sr\/86Sr ratios, and microthermometry. Dolomite type 1 formed due to the reflux of platform-top evaporated seawater that flowed through the platform interior in the Early Triassic. Dolomite types 2 and 3 are interpreted to have formed at elevated temperatures during or after Late Triassic platform burial and to have played a secondary role in forming the dolostone. The dolomitizing fluids that resulted in the formation of dolomite types 2 and 3 were derived from Early Triassic seawater-like fluid that was expelled from the Lower Triassic basinal carbonate sediments and moved updip to the platform interior. Dolomitized clasts in partially or non-dolomitized slope breccias demonstrate pre-burial timing of dolomite type 1, and distinguish the earlier dolomitization from later, post-burial dolomitization represented by dolomite types 2 and 3. Dolomite type 1 retains its Early Triassic seawater \u03b413C and 87Sr\/86Sr signatures, whereas overlapping geochemical fields of the three types of dolomite (trace element concentration, \u03b418O) imply that burial dolomitizing fluids locally reset the geochemistry of dolomite type 1. This finding suggests that the same dolomite archive may retain well-preserved or altered data depending on the specific geochemical proxy and that identifying individual dolomitization mechanisms using geochemical proxies is possible only in some cases.\n               ","1":"\n                  The Deep Adda-1 well in the Danish Central Graben, North Sea, provides a record of mid-Cretaceous sedimentation on the eastern flank of the intrabasinal Adda\u2013Tyra inversion high.

The upper Hauterivian \u2013 lowermost Barremian lower Tuxen Formation (nannozones BC10 \u2013 lowermost BC14), beneath the MMB, represents a well-ventilated, current-swept setting supporting a diverse benthic fauna and characterized by a condensed succession with hardgrounds, at one level defining a biostratigraphic hiatus, and stacked, thin shallowing-upward parasequences. The succeeding lower Barremian MMB (nannozone BC14) attests to poorly oxygenated bottom waters and a total lack of epi- and infauna; the calm, inhospitable sea floor was intermittently disturbed by muddy turbidity currents and debris flows. The base-MMB surface is a complex fractured hardground indicative of relative sea-level fall and protracted winnowing of the cemented sea floor. The Deep Adda-1 core thus records a sea-level excursion that accompanied the onset of early Barremian oxygen depletion in concert with additional potential forcing factors such as coeval volcanism and watermass warming.\n               ","2":"\n                  Carbonate contourite drifts are poorly documented in the onshore record because of the difficulty of implementing diagnostic criteria for their recognition. Accordingly, little is known about the relative position of carbonate drifts with respect to ancient carbonate platforms, seaways and shallow passages within the context of palaeoceanography. This study presents a fossil example of mixed carbonate-siliciclastic drift cropping out in a quarry in Osuna (Sevilla province, southern Spain) at the northern end of the Guadalhorce Corridor, a Miocene strait connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean in the Betic Cordillera. Based on the facies and sedimentary structures, the studied succession is divided into three units: 1) the lower unit, Unit 1, is a 33-m thick succession of large carbonate bodies with mega cross-stratification pointing to the southeast and secondarily to the northwest interpreted as a contourite drift; 2) the intermediate Unit 2 is a 0.5\u20132-m thick terrigenous conglomerate body eroding the top of Unit 1; and 3) the uppermost Unit 3 consists of a 6-m thick siliciclastic-dominated succession with herringbone cross-stratification and a dominant direction of the structures to the northwest interpreted as tidal deposits. The large-scale sediment bodies with mega cross-beds, the presence of reactivation surfaces with grain-size changes, and the unidirectionality of the structures were diagnostic for the recognition of Unit 1 as drift deposits. The dominant sedimentary structures pointing to the southeast in the drift were generated by Atlantic inflow into the Mediterranean. This challenges the classical \u201csiphon\u201d model for the Atlantic-Mediterranean water-mass circulation pattern for this age. The conglomerates of Unit 2 evidence regional uplift of the southern margin of the Guadalquivir Basin that promoted a change in the depositional mode from a bottom-current dominated (Unit 1) to a tide-dominated environment (Unit 3) after the closure of the Guadalhorce Corridor in the Messinian.\n               ","3":"\n                  The relationship between tectonic uplift, climate change and continental silicate weathering has long been debated because deconstructing the tectonic and climatic impacts on continental silicate weathering is challenging. To address this issue, we present long-term climatic and silicate weathering records since 7.3\u202fMa on tectonically active NE Tibet retrieved from the SG-1 and SG-1b lake sediment drill cores in the western Qaidam Basin. We find distinct correlations between silicate weathering and regional climate on long-term (>106\u202fyears) and short-term (105\u2013106\u202fyears) time scales. On long-term scales, silicate weathering intensity exhibits a consistent evolution with regional climate, both of which are dominantly controlled by global climate change. This evolution resulted in a stable weathering intensity during 7.3\u2013~3.6\u202fMa and a weakening of weathering intensity since ~3.6\u202fMa, followed by a continuous decreasing trend after 2.6\u202fMa. However, on short-term scales, silicate weathering intensity displays out-of-phase changes with the regional climate at 6.9\u20133.7\u202fMa and 0.2\u20130.1\u202fMa and in-phase changes at 7.3\u20136.9\u202fMa and 3.7\u20130.2\u202fMa. We attribute this long-term consistency between the weathering intensity and climate to aridification in inland Asia, but the short-term inconsistencies at 6.9\u20133.7\u202fMa and 0.2\u20130.1\u202fMa to the change in the sediment routing system impacted by the regional climate within a tectonically active setting. Such a change in the sediment routing system along with sediment recycling may bias weathering indication on orbital time scales, and our study therefore suggests a more complex response of silicate weathering to tectonic and climatic forcings.\n               ","4":"\n                  The mechanism of fault-controlled hydrothermal dolomitization has long been controversial due to its complicated tectonic and diagenetic conditions, especially for the source of dolomitizing fluids and its hydrological driving models. In the southeastern Sichuan Basin, fracture-related dolomite bodies are well developed in a Middle Permian carbonate succession, providing an example of dolomitization and its relationship with regional tectonic activities. Previously, many of the dolomites in the Sichuan Basin have been interpreted as of hydrothermal origin but are usually poorly defined since it is hard to determine the nature and timing of dolomitization. In the current study, new petrographic, geochemical, and chronological data of Middle Permian dolomites have been integrated and allowed the classification of those dolomites into two categories (replacive dolomites of D1\u2013D2 and fracture-\/vug-filling dolomites of D3\u2013D5). Calcite (C1\u2013C3) and other non\u2011carbonate cements have also been found. The near-micritic dolomite (D1) was formed at the near-surface to early burial stage, likely from modified seawaters, which was reflected by its similar \u03b418Ofluid estimates of the parent dolomitizing fluids and rare earth element patterns to matrix lime mudstone, as well as the fabric retentive texture. The fabric destructive (D2) and fracture-\/vug-filling dolomites (D3\u2013D5) are characterized by the high estimates of \u03b418Ofluid of their parent dolomitizing fluids, high 87Sr\/86Sr ratios, high Fe and Mn concentrations, positive Eu anomalies, high T\n                        h\n                      values, and high salinity estimates, indicating a hydrothermal origin. However, the limestone-like \u03b413CVPDB and strongly negative Ce anomalies of D2\u2013D5 suggest that these dolomites may have originally evolved from seawater-derived fluids which circulated in the basal clastic rocks and flowed upwards by thermal convection through fault systems. New U\u2013Pb ages bracketed a time range of these dolomites from 251\u202f\u00b1\u202f11\u202fMa to 264\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fMa, coinciding with the emplacement of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (~257\u2013260\u202fMa). This may imply that the contemporary basement faulting and associated abnormal thermal event in southeastern Sichuan Basin still remotely echoed with the activities of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province, although the study area was far away from its eruption center. It facilitated the fluid circulation through fault systems and underlying sandstone aquifers and thus drove fault-controlled hydrothermal dolomitization at shallow burial backgrounds.\n               ","5":"\n                  Barite (BaSO4) is widely formed in modern and ancient sedimentary environments by the interaction of barium- and sulfate-bearing fluids from a variety of sources. A word-class barite deposit, hosted by lower Cambrian black shale in the Tianzhu area of the Yangtze block, is a well-known stratiform barite ore deposits. Its origin remains highly debated. A variety of genetic models have been proposed, including biological enrichment, cold seep and submarine exhalative hydrothermal activity, which have differing implications for paleo-oceanic environmental interpretation and resource exploration. We conducted a detailed sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical study of the Tianzhu barite deposit. It dominated by anhedral barite with variable carbonate-pyrite-hyalophane associations and siliciclastic admixtures. These typically display porous and pore-filling structures, as well as dendritic and rosette-like growth forms, indicating in situ precipitation near the sediment-water interface. Based on vertical variation in sedimentary and mineralogical features, four vertically successive Units (I\u2013IV) can be recognized. Barite samples in Units I and III display 87Sr\/86Sr ratios within a very narrow range (0.7084 to 0.7085), nearly identical with coeval seawater values; while others display elevated ratios (0.7086 to 0.7279) that likely reflect contributions from modified porewater and\/or siliciclastic admixture. Barites also display seawater-like and higher \u03b434Sbrt values (32.3\u202f\u2030 to 48.6\u202f\u2030) with respect to coeval seawater sulfate, and \u03b434Sbrt-\u03b418Obrt co-variation trends extending from seawater sulfate to higher \u03b4-values. Co-occurring authigenic dolomites display moderately negative \u03b413Ccarb values (\u221218.3\u202f\u2030 to \u22127.2\u202f\u2030). These features suggest precipitation at the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) near the sediment-water interface. Overall, these characteristics of the Tianzhu barite deposit most closely resemble features associated with barite enrichment in modern and ancient cold seeps. This genetic model differs from previous interpretations, and does not require a restricted basin with seawater sulfate-depletion. This study has implications for understanding of oceanic barium\u2011sulfur cycling and environmental change in the early Cambrian, and formation of shale-hosted stratiform barite deposit in the geological record.\n               ","6":"\n                  Sedimentary processes of marine turbidite systems under sea-level changes have been the focus of deep-water sedimentology. Compared with well-studied marine basins, the products of deep-water sediment gravity flows responding to lake-level changes in closed lacustrine basins are still poorly understood. In this study, we integrate cores of 10 exploratory wells, logs of 280 development wells, 3D seismic data and geochemical elements from the Eocene Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, East China to investigate sedimentary mechanisms and depositional architecture of lacustrine turbidite systems under lake-level changes. The studied strata are divided into three parasequence sets (PSS4\u202f~\u202fPSS2), corresponding to early highstand normal regression with ascending trajectories, late highstand normal regression with flat trajectories, and forced regression with descending trajectories, respectively. From early highstand normal regression to forced regression, the ratios of Fe\/Mn and U\/Th reveal that the humid climate shifted to the arid climate. More lithofacies clues indicate that turbidites in highstand normal regression were triggered by river floods, whereas counterparts in forced regression were related to sediment failures. There are different architectural features of turbidite systems in three regression stages. PSS4 developed a series of channel belts within which individual channel elements are aggraded vertically. PSS3 is composed of a channelized lobe formed by individual distributary channels migrating laterally. PSS2 is characterized by a suite of compensational stacking debrite tongues. Climate forcing is a crucial factor controlling depositional architecture of the turbidite systems. A relatively humid climate during highstand normal regression led to rising lake-level and frequent floods, which are conducive to the formation of hyperpycnal-fed channel-lobe systems. Nevertheless, during forced regression under an arid climate, the strong progradational clinothems were prone to failure and sediment remobilization, resulting in debrite tongue complexes. This study highlights depositional differences of lacustrine turbidites during regression stages under the control of climate. Meanwhile, it also provides a new predictive model for deep-water hydrocarbon exploration and production in lacustrine basins worldwide.\n               ","7":"\n                  This work provides the first evidence of seismites within Miocene gypsum microbialites deposited in inland lakes. Seismites are observed on good quality outcrops in two separated successions of the Madrid and Duero basins (central Spain) that are sited nearby strike-slip faults. The successions consist of sandy gypsum facies interbedded with gypsiferous mudstone and marlstone. The association of microbial induced sedimentary structures (MISS) with mineralogical biosignatures such as intrasediment-grown lenticular gypsum, dolomite with inner biomolds and other biological induced minerals, supports that gypsum beds represent microbialites. Gypsum microbialites are characterized by parallel-lamination, cross-bedding and laminated leveling structures. The rapid mineralization of the microbial mats and biostabilization processes may play a role in the preservation of the depositional structures in sulfates. In addition to MISS, several categories of large-scale soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDSs) reflecting ductile and brittle behavior repeat vertically through the successions. These are classified as load casts, pillows, dish structures, convolute bedding and lamination, plastic intrusions, fluid escape tubes, mud\/sand volcanoes, Neptunian dikes and fractures. The deformation structures in crystalline sediments are interpreted to be caused by seismic shocks of magnitude over 5 related with syndepositional fault movements. Micromorphological analysis of gypsum beds reveals distinctive features such as cracked crystals, oriented crystals filling dikes and horizontal microstylolites that also indicate seismic shocks. Comparison between the two basins shows some differences in the type and vertical distribution of structures, and this suggests that earthquakes were less frequent and of higher magnitude in the Madrid Basin. The results confirm that microbial gypsum deposits have both high susceptibility to earthquakes and high potential to preserve a wide range of information of the sedimentary environment, including paleoecology, paleogeochemistry, paleohydrodynamics, and seismogenic behavior of microbial sediments and faults.\n               ","8":"\n                  To understand the early topographic growth of the Tibetan Plateau and the causes and effects of climate change in this region, it is important to reconstruct the drainage evolution across Southeast Tibet. Based on age constraints provided by detrital zircons in the fluvial sandstones in the Khorat Plateau Basin, we identified a major Early Cretaceous drainage disruption and reorganization event. The ages and Hf isotope compositions of the detrital zircons in the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Phu Kradung to Phu Phan formations (166\u2013122\u202fMa) suggest the existence of an exorheic continental-scale paleo-Mekong River with headwaters in the Songpan-Garze and Qiangtang terranes. This paleo-river flowed southwards across the Khorat Plateau to what is presently the offshore Phuquoc Basin, which was then part of the Neo-Tethys Ocean. In contrast, the U-Pb-Hf compositions of the detrital zircons in the Lower Cretaceous Khok Kruat Formation (122\u2013113\u202fMa) indicate that a prominent detrital supply from the Sibumasu magmatic rocks was transported by the paleo-Salween River. This major change reflects the occurrence of ancestral transcontinental river disruption at around 122\u202fMa, which was driven by the final collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang and Woyla Arc and Sibumasu terranes. The tectonic uplift and ensuing arid climate corresponded to the reorganization of the ancestral Mekong drainage system during the Mid-Cretaceous (113\u201394\u202fMa).\n               ","9":"\n                  As one of the most important forcing factors, sea level fluctuations exert a major influence on deep-water depositional processes, however, it is still not well understood how they control the evolution of the specific deep-water system over different timescales. For relatively longer (1 My) and shorter (100 Ky) timescales, we characterize deep-water sedimentary records on the Pearl River margin using seismic and borehole data, and then compare them with the contemporaneous sea-level curve to exam the varied roles sea levels have played in impacting the development of the deep-marine system. Results indicate that over both the 1 My-scale and the 100 Ky-scale, the studied deep-water system shows systematic variations that are strongly suggested to arise from the modulation of sea levels. Specifically, over the 1 My-scale, facies and depocenters of the deep-water system all show significant changes. Large fan lobes (consisting of both turbidites and mass-transport deposits) with more distal depocenters likely correspond with low-amplitude and high-frequency sea level fluctuations and slightly rising shelf edge trajectories, whereas smaller turbidite fan lobes with more proximal depocenters likely reflect high-amplitude and low-frequency sea level fluctuations and steeply rising shelf-edge trajectories. In contrast, within the 100 Ky-scale of a glacial-interglacial cycle, the composition of deep-water deposits also shows significant variations. Coarser-grained deposits with higher organic carbon (TOC) content and lower calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content are interpreted to reflect periods of glacial sea-level lowstand, whereas finer-grained sediments having lower TOC and higher CaCO3 content reflect interglacial sea-level highstand. Moreover, the spectrum characteristics of these constituent curves are very similar to those of contemporaneous sea levels, reflecting Milankovitch climatic forcings and further validating the tight coupling between sea-level stands and sediment compositions. These correlations between sedimentary records and sea level behaviors suggest that it was mainly a long-term change in the amplitude and frequency of eustatic cycles that controlled the overall architecture of the deep-water system, whereas it was shorter term, changing sea-level stands that played a role and impacted the deep-water sediment composition.\n               ","10":"\n                  Carbonate deposits and sedimentary records from lakes in southern Patagonia provides an excellent contribution in the regional environmental register. The Laguna Timone is situated within a maar of the Pali Aike Volcanic Field, a Quaternary volcano-tectonic complex in southernmost South America and represents one of hundreds of \u201cpools\u201d of brines developed after explosive volcanic eruptions in a periglacial environment. The lake constitutes an endorheic hydrological system where processes leading to carbonate precipitation took place under extreme physicochemical conditions and biological influences that can be explored. Laguna Timone is recharged by groundwater and sporadic episodes of precipitation (ca. 200\u202fmm\/year) and high evaporation rates are controlled by regimes of strong wind (westerlies) and seasonal solar radiation. Carbonate precipitation was studied in microbialite fragments of tufa deposits and carbonate crust located in the edge of the lake, and the mineralogy of all samples is calcite.\u00a0The clay fraction of the sediment underlying the carbonates was characterized and HRTEM analysis shows that authigenic smectites have influence on calcite crystal precipitation. The positive \u03b418O values (2.28\u202f\u2030) in thin crust layers are associated with evaporation processes. In contrast, the negative \u03b418O values (\u22126.52\u202f\u2030) in the microbialites show meteoric and\/or groundwater influences. The \u03b413C (\u22120.43\u202f\u2030 to 2.50\u202f\u2030) values indicate physico-chemical and biochemical processes controlling the precipitation. The carbonate precipitation involves the interrelations of hydrogeological properties, climate and biological influences. Laguna Timone provides a natural laboratory for understanding mineral precipitation processes that register continuous climatic and environmental archives.\n               ","11":"\n                  Unraveling the processes involved in travertines and tufa formation, and the textural and geochemical signatures they preserve, are relevant given their potential as world-class oil reservoirs and analogues for ancient microbial carbonates. This study yields insights into the processes controlling hydrochemistry, isotopic fractionation and carbonate precipitation within a travertine system located in the southern border of the Puna plateau (Argentina), at an active high-altitude volcano-tectonic setting. Geochemical and isotopic composition of hot spring waters, together with its physico-chemical parameters, are typical of deep-cycled meteoric waters with most of the CO2 provided by a magmatic source. Downstream CO2 degassing rises the pH and shifts carbonate chemical equilibrium providing the bulk conditions for CaCO3 precipitation. Precipitates occur mainly as aragonite near hot springs and calcite throughout the rest of the system (~1\u202fkm extent) in close association with cyanobacteria, diatoms and exopolymeric substances (EPS). Constructive morphologies and crystalline crusts develop where strong CO2 degassing occurs, driven by contrasting CO2 partial pressures between hot spring waters and the atmosphere, and also associated to incremental downstream turbulence (e.g., dams and waterfalls). Biological influence is preponderant within downstream calm pools by providing an EPS substrate suitable for calcite nucleation, contributing to clotted micrite textures. Downstream trend towards heavier isotopic compositions of waters and related carbonates is given by the preferential degassing and evaporation of lighter isotopes (12C and 16O) and enrichment of heavy isotopes (13C and 18O) in the carbonate phase. Nonequilibrium isotopic fractionation seems to relate with kinetically-controlled processes and pH changes along the system. This study highlights that, while at the macroscale physico-chemical processes control bulk water and carbonate chemistry, providing favorable conditions for carbonate precipitation, at the microscale microbial activity has some control, particularly on the development of carbonate microtextures.\n               ","12":"\n                  The upper part of the Early Eocene Figols Group cropping out near the town of Tremp (province of Lerida, Spain), is a wonderfully exposed sedimentary succession mainly constituted by mouth bar deposits and delta-front sandstone lobes, forming a fluvio-deltaic system dominated by catastrophic fluvial floods. These deltaic sandstones are vertically associated with carbonate and hybrid (mixed carbonate and siliciclastic) sediments that are physically related to a carbonate ramp platform which crops out in the southernmost part of the study area. The vertical and lateral juxtaposition of these depositional systems allows investigating how the stratigraphic controls (as climate and relative sea level) affect the resulting facies assemblages. The studied succession has been subdivided following a pragmatic physical stratigraphic approach into three 3rd order large-scale depositional sequences (FG2, FG3, and FG4), six 4th order small-scale depositional sequences and 21 EDSs (elementary depositional sequences). The latter are considered the stratigraphic building block of the succession, made of 10s of meter scale forestepping sandstones followed by, backstepping sandstones, bioclastic and mudstone sediments. During the lowstand system tract (LST), the depositional sequences FG2 and FG3 are characterized by the occurrence of flood-dominated deltaic systems (mouth bars and lobes). These deltaic deposits mainly developed in the northern sector characterized by higher subsidence. The overlain transgressive system tract (TST) is dominated by hybrid sediments and carbonates that initially accumulated in the southern zone and then progressively spread out over the entire area. The highstand system tract (HST) is mainly constituted by shelfal fine-grained sediments reflecting the reactivation of the fluvial input and deltaic clastic deposition in a more landward position. This sequential model resulted to be applicable at all hierarchical scales and in particular to the EDS scale. In FG4, the fluvio-deltaic systems became coarser-grained and channelized, the carbonate production on the shelf decreased and lagoonal fines were accumulated so as to separate vertically the fluvio-deltaic bodies. Syn-sedimentary tectonic activity capable to produce local variations of the available accommodation space is inferred by the geometry and facies distribution shown in the high-resolution correlation framework, particularly if considered at the physical scale of EDSs.\n               ","13":"\n                  A varying abundance of carbonate-bearing fluorapatite (CFA) nodules in Eocene lacustrine shale in the Bohai Bay Basin was observed; however, mineralogical and geochemical awareness is lacking, which limits the specific understanding of CFA formation mechanisms and paleoenvironmental proxies. We specified the petrology, trace elements (TE), rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) of the CFA nodules by using an integrated approach of cathodoluminescence, micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electron microprobe analysis and laser ablation\u2013inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry. The results suggest that CaO (25.85 to 39.95\u202fwt%), P2O5 (17.19 to 29.35\u202fwt%) and F (0.71 to 2.99\u202fwt%) are the dominant components of the CFA nodules, with low Mn\/Fe ratios and few incorporations of CO3\n                     2\u2212. They show selective concentrations of Sr (avg. 14,963.3\u202fppm), Ba (avg. 1831.6\u202fppm), U (avg. 314.2\u202fppm), Zr (avg. 263.5\u202fppm), and Th (avg. 185.4\u202fppm) and apparent negative Y anomalies with low Y\/Ho ratios (18.40 to 28.90). These CFA nodules were classified into three types according to REY patterns normalized to the Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS). Type A nodules enclosed by micritic calcite laminae are middle rare earth elements (MREE) enriched which yield a typical \u201cbell-shaped\u201d REY pattern, nonanomalies of Ce and a good correlation of \u03a3REY with Ce\/Ce* (R2\u202f=\u202f0.90) and Ba (R2\u202f=\u202f0.95). Type B nodules in the clay and organic-rich laminae were better phosphatized and display more heavy rare earth elements (HREE) depletion, minimal Ce anomalies and a good correlation between CaO and P2O5 (R2\u202f=\u202f0.84) than type A nodules. Type C nodules are rare but show light rare earth elements (LREE) enrichment relative to type A and B nodules. The adsorption of P, TE and REY by Fe-(oxyhydr)oxide and organic matter is significant for CFA formation through the \u201cdissolution-recapture-reprecipitation\u201d process in the ambient pore water of the Fe reduction zone during early diagenesis. The retention of HREE as HREE(CO3)2\u2212 in more reducing bottom water is critical to the HREE depletion for type B and C nodules, while the release of LREE from bacterial-mediated degradation of organic matter into ambient pore water enhances the concentration of LREE on type C nodules. Deviation of the REY patterns is probably related to the differential suboxic redoxclines for the deposition of calcite-rich and clay- and organic-rich laminae of shale, which are considered the depositional environment proxies of lacustrine shale.\n               ","14":"\n                  The northern Wuerxun Sag is a lacustrine rift basin which experienced multiple faulting and subsidence during the Lower Cretaceous. The tectonic evolution with uplifted regions as the provenances caused the complex sedimentary fill of the Lower Cretaceous Nantun Formation. In this paper, we use well log, core and 3D seismic data to characterise the sedimentary facies and depositional environment of the Nantun Formation, and consider how this affects the distribution of hydrocarbons within the basin. Four depositional systems are recognised in this study: fan deltas located along the steep slopes; braided deltas along the gentle slopes; sublacustrine fans and lacustrine in the centre of the basin. Fan deltas are mainly composed of coarser sediments with lower sediment maturity than braided deltas, and are mainly located in steep slopes with rift border faults. Sublacustrine fans form lenticular depositional bodies in the basin centre, with higher sediment maturity as a result of reworking. Three sediment-transport pathways were recognised which governed the sediment deposition in this basin, which are (1) the steep rift border fault in the northwest, (2) the NE\u2013SW Surennuoer strike-slip fault zone (SSFZ), and (3) the major faults in the south-eastern gentle slope. Most oil is found in sublacustrine fan sandstones which were transported along the SSFZ mainly from shallower fan deltas, with underlying mudstones (SQN1) as effective source rocks and overlying thick and laterally continuous lacustrine mudstones (SQD1) as seal rocks. The good source\u2013reservoir\u2013seal assemblages enable prolific near-source oil distribution in this area, suggesting the sedimentary controls on oil accumulation, which may guide future oil exploration and production activities in this area.\n               ","15":"\n                  Parametric curve-fitting techniques are routinely adopted to derive the components of individual grain-size distributions of sediment samples.

In this study, we use numerical techniques to develop a novel strategy enabling the efficient and flexible unmixing of single-sample grain-size distributions. The method was applied to a large set of grain-size distributions of late Quaternary aeolian sediments from the desert-loess transition zone around the Tengger Desert in North China. The potential structures of the pooled unmixed subpopulations were derived using a finite mixture model, taking variances into account, together with a pattern recognition (clustering) method. Five unimodal endmembers were identified by the finite mixture model and four prevalent structural patterns were recognized by the clustering method. The significances of the endmembers and structural patterns are discussed in detail. We demonstrate that the single-sample unmixing method can be used to complement the widely applied end-member modelling to reveal potential provenances of large datasets of grain-size distributions, and that the component structures of grain-size distributions may contain valuable information that can be used to constrain the associated paleoenvironmental conditions.\n               ","16":"\n                  Evaporites are abundant in modern playa lakes, where efflorescence, inorganic and\/or bioinduced precipitation coexist with siliciclastic deposition. Overall, the sensibility of salts to slight physicochemical changes results in partial to complete dissolution of evaporites in surface and shallow subsurface. However, in some cases, salt minerals are pseudomorphically replaced, providing a snapshot to depositional settings and diagenetic processes of evaporite-bearing successions. This is recorded in the Quiric\u00f3 Formation (Lower Cretaceous), Sanfranciscana Basin, southeastern Brazil. This studied succession portrays a playa lake system subdivided in saline flat and saline lake deposits, whose diagenesis was marked by ubiquitous cementation and replacement reactions. Petrographic and geochemical techniques were undertaken to characterise primary and secondary textures, mineralogy and distribution of mudstone- and sandstone-hosted pseudomorphs. The pseudomorphs frequently underlie the stratigraphic contact of playa lake-aeolian beds. Pseudomorphs occur as coalescent nodules and as chaotically-distributed chevron crystals, composed of inequicrystalline calcite mosaics. Nodular pseudomorphs have cubic\/sub-cubic \u201cghost\u201d inclusions and displacive contacts with the matrix, whereas the contacts of chevron pseudomorphs and the matrix are undisturbed. Both types exhibit morphological replication of precursor minerals and non-luminescent euhedral relicts. Stable isotopic signatures are covariant and range between \u22121.6\u20130.6\u202f\u2030 \u03b413C and 1.4\u20132.5\u202f\u2030 \u03b418O for nodular pseudomorphs, and \u22122.2 to \u22121.5\u202f\u2030 \u03b413C and 0.3\u20131.3\u202f\u2030 \u03b418O for chevron pseudomorphs. Nodular crystals reflect subaerial and intrasedimentary crystallisation of Ca-sulphates in saline flats, whereas chevron-shaped pseudomorphs indicate bottom-growth halite in shallow lakes. Textural evidences from pseudomorphs and host lithologies constrain the diagenetic overprint to surface and shallow burial settings (syndepositional\/eodiagenetic stages). Despite multiple generations of calcite, the constant isotopic signatures of pseudomorphs reflect water chemistry fractionation in a closed-lake basin. Widespread calcitisation of playa lake sediments was caused by calcium-rich groundwaters, influenced by limestones from the Precambrian basement. The playa lake deposits record the onset of aridification processes that culminated in the Thermal Cretaceous Maximum.\n               ","17":"\n                  The reconstruction of the upper Palaeozoic sedimentary evolution of Western Mediterranean area is suffering for scarce age documentation of its stratigraphic units. This is also the consequence of the metamorphism and deformation they experienced during the Alpine tectonic events. Based on palynology and thermal maturity assessment, we contribute to this issue reporting biostratigraphic and sedimentological results in key-outcrops of the upper Palaeozoic successions of southern Tuscany (Italy), thus offering new data for the Palaeozoic units of the inner Northern Apennines, as well as for their palaeogeographic and palaeotectonic evolution predating the opening of the Alpine Neo-Tethys. This study is focused on the Falsacqua Formation mainly consisting of quartzitic phyllite, sandstone and carbonate, representing the basal succession of two tectonic units exposed in the Middle Tuscan Ridge, and which age attribution was strongly debated in literature and referred either to late Carboniferous-early Permian or Devonian. Palynological data document the first finding of a microflora of middle-late Permian age adding key chronological constraints. This age assignment permits to correlate the Falsacqua Formation with the coeval deposits of southern Tuscany (i.e., Farma and Poggio al Carpino formations) and Elba Island (Rio Marina Formation) that are all characterized by a similar microfloral content. Optical thermal maturity index as Spore Colour Index is around 9 to 10 and suggests a T peak of about 300\u2013350\u202f\u00b0C while the Raman spectroscopy on carbonaceous material indicates a T peak around 375\u202f\u00b0C for both tectonic units. These data provide new constraints for the maximum T values occurred during syn-collisional metamorphism developed in this sector of the Northern Apennines.\n               ","18":"\n                  Travertine-depositing hot springs can generate various carbonate minerals with or without the participation of microorganisms. They thus serve as good natural laboratories to study abiotic and biotic factors controlling the precipitation of different carbonate minerals and CaCO3 polymorphism. Through tens of years' investigations on travertines, considerable advances about carbonate mineral precipitation have been made. Here, we summarized general hydrological features of travertine systems, and driving forces, microenvironments, and mechanisms of the precipitation of different carbonate minerals in travertine-depositing hot springs by integrating present advances and conducting hydrochemical simulations. Travertine-depositing hot springs can be divided into near-neutral pH hot springs and hyperalkaline hot springs and contain four types of microenvironments: hypogean solid-water interface, epigean solid-water interface, air-water interface, and subaerial exposure surface. Both abiotic (passive CO2 degassing, atmospheric CO2 uptake, evaporation, and fluid mixing) and biotic (metabolism, organism-related crystal nucleation, and trapping and binding) processes may drive carbonate formation. The specific driving forces, however, depend on bulk water hydrochemistry and microenvironments. Calcite and aragonite are the most common minerals in travertines and the calcite-aragonite polymorphism might be under decisive influences from bulk water chemistry, especially [Mg2+]\/[Ca2+], in some conditions. However, calcium carbonate precipitation in hot springs is controlled by solute transport in microenvironments, and any local change induced by hydrodynamics, microorganisms, and extracellular polymeric substances may significantly modify CaCO3 precipitation and polymorphism. Such integrated control from bulk water composition and microenvironments also affects the formation of other carbonate minerals, but their exact roles remain unclear. Overall, despite the fruitful recent findings, further investigations, especially those focusing on microenvironments, are still imperative to better understand carbonate precipitation in hot springs. These microenvironment-scale studies might also provide insights on carbonate precipitation in other environments.\n               ","19":"\n                  During the early and middle Miocene, diverse photozoan to heterozoan carbonate and mixed carbonate-siliciclastic depositional systems characterized the Mediterranean region at palaeo-latitudes of 30\u201340\u00b0N, during a time of warm climate. These systems ranged from carbonate ramp to rimmed platforms to current-swept flooded incised palaeo-valleys, seaways and straits. This study focuses on the facies character, skeletal biota composition, diagenesis and stable carbon and oxygen isotope signature of a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic succession (lower-middle Miocene Finale Ligure Limestone and underlying Oligocene-lower Miocene siliciclastic deposits) accumulated in a high-energy coastal setting (Finale Ligure, NW Italy) to improve the knowledge on the variety and controlling factors of Miocene heterozoan skeletal carbonates.\n                  The 3D reconstruction of the geometry of the early-middle Miocene Finale Ligure basin identifies an embayment, about 35\u202fkm2 wide, limited by uplifted and eroded Alpine tectonic units and connected to the open sea through a strait. The Oligocene-Miocene sedimentary succession unconformably overlying the Alpine deformed substrate consists of 14 lithofacies (L1-L14). Besides pockets of karstic breccias (L1) preceding the marine transgression, discontinuous outcrops of glaucony-bearing litharenite, siltstone, conglomerate and wackestone\/packstone with planktonic foraminifera (L2-L4) represent the preserved remnants of an eroded marine shelf affected by tectonic uplift and subsequent erosion, approximately in the Aquitanian-Burdigalian, overlain through an angular unconformity by transgressive conglomerates and bioturbated litharenites (L5-L7). The onset of carbonate skeletal production characterizes the overlying compositionally mixed carbonate-siliciclastic Langhian-Serravallian Finale Ligure Limestone succession (up to 100\u2013150\u202fm thick, L8-L14). These cross-bedded skeletal packstone and grainstone\/rudstone are composed of barnacles, echinoderms, bryozoans, bivalves, scleractinian and stylasterid corals, and lack halimedacean algae as previously published. They accumulated in a high-energy setting with strong bottom currents, driven by the amplification of tidal and\/or storm currents in a confined embayment, promoting the formation of seaward prograding metre-scale subaqueous dunes.\n                  Unlike other lower-middle Miocene carbonate systems, the Finale Ligure heterozoan carbonates contain rare coralline red algae and larger benthic foraminifera but are enriched in barnacles, scleractinian and stylasterid corals. The coastal palaeo-environmental conditions, with hard rocky substrates, strong bottom currents, high nutrients and water turbidity, influenced the composition of the skeletal carbonate producers. These distinctive lithofacies character and composition resulted from the confined embayment morphology inherited from the marine flooded Alpine bedrock that was subjected to land runoff driving nutrient input.\n               ","20":"\n                  This study describes the sedimentological aspects of the Lower Cambrian Khewra Sandstone, along with its lithostratigraphic correlation of globally distributed coeval red sandstones to decipher the imprints of Pan-African Orogeny. Despite the economic significance of Khewra Sandstone, the understanding of its environment of deposition, provenance and lower contact with the suite of igneous body namely Khewrite is poor. The Khewra Sandstone is an allostratigraphic unit bounded by unconformities. The upward coarsening sequence with abundant sedimentary structures and varying sedimentological properties of the topmost bed suggest that the Khewra Sandstone is tempestites deposited under fluvio-deltaic depositional environment. This sandstone is dominated by subarkoses, feldspathic litharenites and sublitharenites which were derived from the craton interior to recycled orogen provenance during the Pan-African orogeny under humid to semi-humid paleoclimatic conditions. The plutonic to metamorphic characteristics of framework grains suggest that the Bundlekhand Craton, Delhi Fold Belt and Aravalli Orogen rocks were the primary provenances. The lower and middle parts of the Khewra Sandstone are significantly affected by diagenesis while the diagenetic action in upper part is negligible and it acts as a potential hydrocarbon reservoir rock. The lithostratigraphic correlation suggests a worldwide series of rifting events before the deposition of Khewra Sandstone and the presence of Khewrite at lower contact marks a similar rifting event on the Indian plate.\n               ","21":"\n                  The economic FeMn ores of the Lower Carboniferous Um Bogma Formation, Southwest Sinai are an important mineral resource, and are also of interest because of their significant enrichment in Cu and U compared to other Phanerozoic Mn deposits. However, their origin remains controversial. Genetic theories range from sedimentary, to hydrothermal, to karst and to laterization origins. This study integrates geological, sedimentological, mineralogical, and geochemical data, particularly rare earth elements, to elucidate the origin of these deposits. Field relations showed the occurrence of FeMn deposits as lenses of Mn-rich material surrounded by Fe-rich clastic deposits, which then are overlain by dolostones, which, in the subsurface, are known to also contain MnFe lenses. The occurrence of the largest of these deposits at a major transgressive surface is consistent with syndepositional Mn mineralization, but not of ironstones. Geochemical proxies, based on modern hydrothermal, diagenetic and hydrogeneous Mn deposits, are mixed: some suggest a hydrogenous and some a hydrothermal source of Fe and Mn. The sweater (hydrogenous) source of Mn and Fe is indicated by the plotting of these ores in the hydrogenous field of the SiAl discrimination plot, by high \u03a3REE (42\u2013327\u202fppm), low La\/Ce ratios (0.261.5), relatively high Y\/Ho ratios for Mn but not for Fe (averages of 35 and 28), and positive YSN anomalies (1\u20131.8). The ores plot in the sweater fields of the (La\/Sm)SN-(La\/Yb)SN and (Sm\/Yb)SN-Y\/Ho diagrams, which also supports this interpretation. However, the hydrothermal input to the source of these ores cannot be ignored and is indicated by high Ba, Cu, Zn, and by high LREE\/HREE ratio as well as the plotting of the FeMn samples in the hydrothermal field of the Fe-Mn-(Ni\u202f+\u202fCo\u202f+\u202fCu)*10, (Co\u202f+\u202fNi)-(As+Cu\u202f+\u202fMo\u202f+\u202fPb\u202f+\u202fV\u202f+\u202fZn), (Co\u202f+\u202fNi\u202f+\u202fCu)-Co\/Zn, CeSN\/CeSN*-YSN\/HoSN and CeSN\/CeSN*-NdSN diagrams. In addition, lower Er\/Nd ratios than that of seawater and similarity of REE parameters such as \u03a3REY, Nd and CeSN\/CeSN* between the diagenetic FeMn nodules and the FeMn ores of Um Bogma Formation suggest a post-depositional overprint on the REEs geochemistry of these ores. We propose, as most consistent with the evidence from tectonic subsidence history, sequence stratigraphy, and our geochemical-mineralogical data combined with that of others, an initial synsedimentary deposition of Mn, derived from a distally-located back-arc spreading center where modified seawater at relatively low temperature was the hydrothermal fluid released into the surrounding seawater. This plume of Mn-rich water, which can be far-travelled, deposited Mn on the unconformity surface during a rapid transgression. This accumulation of Mn was subsequently modified and significantly upgraded during karstification of the host dolostones soon after deposition of the dolostones. It is likely that the Fe was introduced at this stage via low-oxygen ground water flow along with As and possibly Ba. Finally, much later, there was a flow of warm, saline oxidizing water through the dolomitic aquifer that precipitated Cu, U and Zn in the weathered material accumulated in the karst cavities.\n               ","22":"\n                  Clay mineralogy and geochemistry of river muds around Taiwan Island reveal dominant provenance control. Abundant illite with subordinate chlorite in the western, northern, and southern parts of the island are derived from Cenozoic mudrocks of the axial Slate Belt and Western Foothills. In eastern Taiwan, chlorite is most common in muds generated from the Tananao Complex, whereas smectite is produced by erosion of arc andesites of the Coastal Range. Kaolinite occurs in minor amounts in western Taiwan, where it is mostly recycled from mudrocks originally generated in mainland China and accumulated along the Chinese passive margin before being tectonically accreted in the Western Foothills of the Taiwan thrust belt. Only locally in more humid regions of northern Taiwan may moderate kaolinite content associated with relatively high illite chemistry index hint at present kaolinite formation. Mineralogical and geochemical indications of weathering are thus considered to be mostly inherited rather than indicative of present climatic and geomorphological conditions.\n                  A comparison of clay-mineral assemblages in Taiwan river muds and offshore deep-sea clays allows us to trace sediment transport from the land to the deep-sea. Mostly illite is supplied to the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, whereas subequal amounts of illite and chlorite are delivered to the Ryukyu forearc basin from eastern Taiwan rivers draining the Tananao Complex. Smectite from Coastal Range andesites is transferred via the Xiuguluan River and Chimei Canyon directly to the Ryukyu trench. Additional amounts of smectite produced in the Ryukyu and Luzon arcs are transported southward to the Ryukyu forearc basin and northward by the Kuroshio Current, northwestward to the northern South China Sea and northeastward to the Huatung Basin and Okinawa Trough.\n               ","23":"\n                  In-situ soft sediment deformation structures (SSDS) are commonly used as paleoseismic indicators in marine and lacustrine sedimentary records. Earthquake-related shear can deform sediment in the shallow subsurface through Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The SSDS related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability have been used to quantify shaking strength of past earthquakes. However, the relative importance of i) lithology and physical properties, ii) potential basal shear surfaces (e.g. clastic deposits), iii) slope angle, and iv) seismic shaking strength (e.g. peak ground acceleration) for deformation related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability remains poorly studied. Lake Ri\u00f1ihue (south-central Chile) is chosen as a natural laboratory for disentangling the effect of the aforementioned factors because i) the sediment composition of background sediment varies downcore and ii) volcanogenic clastic deposits are abundant within the sedimentary sequence. A previous study at lake Ri\u00f1ihue identified 25 SSDS intervals induced by historical earthquakes of varying rupture extent in 17 sediment cores taken at slope angles ranging from ~0.2\u00b0 to ~4.9\u00b0 (i.e. 16 slope sites and 1 basin site). Our study shows that deformation mostly occurs directly above volcanogenic deposits (i.e. 72\u202f% of SSDS intervals), suggesting that volcanogenic deposits promote earthquake-induced deformation by strain softening, liquefaction or water film formation. Deformation thickness of SSDS increases with higher slope angles (i.e. strong positive correlation). Additionally, deformation thickness commonly corresponds to the stratigraphic depth of the youngest preceding volcanogenic deposit, but for steeper slope angles stratigraphically older volcanogenic deposits can function as basal shear surface. Therefore, we suggest that deformation thickness is primarily regulated by gravitational stress (i.e. slope angle) and secondarily by the stratigraphic depth of volcanogenic deposits. The earthquakes related to strongest shaking caused almost exclusively SSDS with highest deformation degrees (i.e. folds and intraclast breccia) as well as largest spatial extent of SSDS, resulting in highest numbers of related SSDS in the investigated cores. Thinner SSDS have higher deformation degrees at a given shaking strength, as seismically-induced shear energy acts more effectively on thinner deforming sequences. Therefore, we suggest that deformation degree is primarily controlled by shaking strength and secondarily modulated by the thickness of the deforming sequences. We infer that deformation thickness is not a reliable indicator of paleoseismic shaking strength as this relies on many preconditioning factors independent of shaking strength. On the other hand, deformation degree can be a good proxy for shaking strength also in settings with varying lithotypes and intercalated clastic event deposits, provided multiple cores are studied to avoid under- or overestimation of paleoseismic shaking strength.\n               ","24":"\n                  A unique occurrence of ironstone lenses represented by ferruginous oncoids is reported from the offshore \u0158eporyje Limestone (Lower Devonian, Pragian) from the Prague Basin (the Stydl\u00e9 Vody Quarry). The oncoidal cortices show distinct arrangement of hematite\/chamosite and\/or iron-bearing calcite laminae, which are irregular, wavy and with a relatively high degree of inheritance of shape of the topography of the underlying laminae. Micro-domes and bulges, comparable to those observed in stromatolites and laminae overgrowing topographic irregularities represented by agglutinated foraminifers cemented to oncoid surfaces, were fairly commonly observed. The foraminifers probably represent the earliest representatives of agglutinated foraminifera encrusting surfaces of ferruginous grains. The surfaces of oncoids are wavy and often wrinkled. Although no microbial remains that could have been directly associated with oncoidal growth were recorded, we regard above mentioned features as indicators of biogenicity of the precipitates. We could only speculate the nature of the microbial consortia, but we regard the alternation of Fe2+ (chamosite, iron-bearing calcite) and Fe3+ (hematite) phases as a result of coupled oxidation - reduction processes related to passive and\/or active microbial metabolic activities (precipitation of ferrihydrite \u2013 hematite precursor) and passive mineral authigenesis mediated by microorganisms (precipitation of chamosite precursor). Spatially restricted occurrence of the oncoidal lenses along with Al\/Al\u202f+\u202fFe\u202f+\u202fMn vs. Fe\/Ti, Nd vs. Ce\/Ce*, Eu\/Sm vs. Sm\/Yb and other crossplots suggest that hydrothermal fluids were the most probable source of ferrous iron. Since most of the known oolitic or oncolitic ironstones represent rather large sedimentary bodies deposited around storm wave base to shallow subtidal environments under influence of upwelled anoxic watermasses or continental runoff, the reported oncolitic mounds represent a specific example of ironstones formation.\n               ","25":"\n                  Geochemical analyses of ancient seep carbonates provide information on past environmental conditions and the chemical composition of seep fluids, allowing for the reconstruction of the evolution of chemosynthesis-based faunal communities in the Phanerozoic. However, diagenetic processes commonly mask the primary composition of ancient seep carbonates, impeding a reliable reconstruction of formation environments. The potential for the preservation of primary element patterns in microcrystalline carbonate, which is typically the volumetrically dominant phase in seep limestones, is poorly constrained to date. This study investigates Jurassic seep limestones from the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon, USA. The seep limestones are mostly composed of three carbonate phases, (1) clotted microcrystalline calcite (clotted micrite), (2) banded and botryoidal, fibrous calcite cement, and (3) equant calcite cement. Mineralogically, these three carbonate phases are now calcite characterized by low magnesium\/calcium (Mg\/Ca) ratios. The fibrous crystal habit and flat crystal terminations indicate that the precursor mineral of the banded and botryoidal cement was originally aragonite. Cathodoluminescence imaging of banded and botryoidal cement shows partially dull to non-luminescence, suggesting that only parts of this phase experienced diagenetic alteration. However, low strontium (Sr) content and positive europium (Eu) anomalies of botryoidal cement indicate that this phase was affected by diagenetic alteration. Equant calcite exhibits the largest crystal size and the highest manganese\/strontium (Mn\/Sr) ratios, suggesting that this phase was the product of later-stage diagenesis, probably having precipitated during progressive burial. High Sr contents and low Mn\/Sr ratios of clotted micrite indicate that this phase was less affected by diagenetic alteration and has the highest preservation potential with respect to the original seep fluid composition. Shale-normalized rare earth element and yttrium (REY) patterns of clotted micrite are close to those of modern seawater, agreeing with a primary composition of clotted micrite. In spite of its small crystal size, which is generally believed to favor recrystallization, our study suggests that clotted micrite has the potential to reliably record information on fluid composition. Given the dominance of microcrystalline carbonate in many seep limestones, this phase may prove to be a valuable archive \u2013 ideally alongside other authigenic minerals \u2013 in cases where its pristine composition can be confirmed by independent petrographical and geochemical proxies.\n               ","26":"\n                  The genesis of banded iron formations is commonly associated with anoxic and iron-rich (ferruginous) marine conditions throughout the Archean to Palaeoproterozoic, and occasionally in the Neoproterozoic. In recent studies, ~2 million-year-old banded iron-rich sedimentary rocks with alternating Fe- and Si-rich bands occurring in the Cape Vani sedimentary basin on Milos island (Greece) were interpreted to be a modern analogue of Precambrian banded iron formations. This interpretation is mainly due to the discovery of photoferrotrophic-like filamentous fossils in massive iron-rich cherty beddings of another subbasin about 450\u202fm to the south. In this study, we re-examined the stratigraphy and lithology of the Cape Vani basin, carried out detailed petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical investigations of the iron-rich sedimentary rocks, as well as volcaniclastic\/volcanic conglomerates and banded hydrothermal veins that are in close spatial association with the iron-rich sedimentary rocks. The Fe2O3 content of the banded iron-rich sedimentary rocks ranges from 0.41 to \u202f11.02\u202fwt% (2.73\u202fwt% on average), far lower than that required per definition for banded iron formations. In addition, the banded iron-rich sedimentary rocks contain substantial clastic materials. Samples with stronger silicification, however, usually contain less clastic materials. The non-clastic components occur as siliceous matrix comprising the same mineral assemblage as the banded hydrothermal veins. These components occur in the interspaces of the clastic materials, within cavities, microfractures and veins crosscutting the layers. Fe2O3, principally reflecting hematite, is intimately linked with the presence of non-clastic materials. Therefore, the non-clastic materials are interpreted as post-depositional products associated with silicification during later stage hydrothermal activities, rather than being syn-depositional as the minerals in Precambrian banded iron formations. Consequently, the Milos banded iron-rich sedimentary rocks cannot be an analogue of Precambrian banded iron formations, seeing their lithological and genetical differences.\n                  The geochemical results reveal that both the banded iron-rich sedimentary rocks and the massive iron-rich cherty beddings have the same clastic provenance as the volcaniclastics\/volcanic conglomerates, but the massive iron-rich cherty beddings contain more hydrothermal contributions due to more intensive fluid-rock interaction. Thus, the two types of iron-rich sedimentary rocks are considered as clastic sedimentary rocks with varying degrees of hydrothermal overprinting. The massive iron-rich cherty beds were generally subjected to stronger hydrothermal overprinting, and, therefore, contain more siliceous matrix and Fe2O3. The enrichment of Fe is due to post-depositional hydrothermal fluid infiltration to the primary sediment piles. The primary layer planes of the banded iron-rich rocks, their interconnected pores and fractures provided preferential pathways for the hydrothermal fluids, and resulted in denser precipitation of Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxides and SiO2 cement therein. The alternating bands in the banded iron-rich sedimentary rocks, therefore, reflect cyclic permeabilities of the layers (i.e., primary sedimentary planes and porosities), rather than cyclic precipitation of Fe- and Si-minerals. This study also sheds light on an alternative formation mechanism for banded structures in Fe- and Si-rich sedimentary rocks similar to those of Precambrian banded iron formations.\n               ","27":"\n                  Aggradational deltaic successions are uncommon in the stratigraphic record since deltas are progradational by nature. However, deltaic coastlines fed by multiple small distributaries rather than by a well-defined trunk fluvial distributary system might result in aggradational successions if the sediment is effectively redistributed from river mouths by active basinal processes (e.g., tides, fairweather waves, and\/or storm waves). The wave-dominated deltaic succession in the lower part of the La Anita Formation accumulated during the foreland stage of the Austral-Magallanes Basin (Argentina). Through a sedimentological and ichnological study of the interval, we evaluate and discuss the potential controls on the evolution of aggradational wave-dominated deltaic successions.\n                  The studied stratigraphic interval is up to 150\u202fm thick and includes facies deposited in wave-dominated prodelta, wave-dominated distal delta-front, wave-influenced mouth bar, terminal channel, and distributary channel settings. These facies associations stack vertically, forming clear thick aggradational sets. Fairweather wave processes largely dominate the delta-front and prodelta deposits, although discrete beds point to the periodic importance of linked storm-wave and river-flood processes. Owing to the alternation of beds generated during fairweather shoaling waves with those of coupled storm-wave and river-flood cycles, it is proposed that the overall aggradational stacking pattern of the delta is the response to the sediment balance. Clastic material supplied by the distributary channels of the delta was easily transported alongshore during fairweather conditions by longshore currents and basinward via storm-generated waves, and\/or hyperpycnal currents and hypopycnal plumes generated by river floods.\n                  The alternation of these depositional processes strongly affected the benthic faunal communities, which is well expressed by the resulting ichnological suites. Storm-wave and river-flood events led to the widespread defaunation of tracemaking organisms, leading to generation of unburrowed beds. Between these events, short-lived colonization windows appeared locally, allowing sparse, facies-crossing dwelling and detritus-feeding burrows to be constructed by the recovering benthic communities. By contrast, during prolonged periods of fairweather shoaling, river-induced physico-chemical stresses were greatly reduced, and the resulting beds display elevated bioturbation intensities with greater numbers of burrows that record a wide range of behaviors.\n               ","28":"\n                  There are many examples suggesting that push moraine formation requires building up of the proglacial wedge and then post-depositional folding and\/or faulting. Only a few studies have been carried out on syntectonic deposition and erosion within proglacial sediment wedges; however, the resulting growth strata were determined based on the high variability in thickness and occurrence of erosional unconformities across the deformed sequence. This study shows how structural interpretation and the area-depth-strain (ADS) balancing method of the growth strata can be applied to better understand the interplay between deformation and deposition within an evolving push moraine primarily composed of a folded sequence of a glaciofluvial fan. This approach, together with analysis of the onlap\/overlap relationships, allowed us to determine the relative rate between deposition and deformation. Moreover it provides an insight into the topography of the push moraine that may be inherited not only from the geometry of deformation structures but also from depositional processes controlling the spatial distribution and thickness variation of the growth strata. This study also gives an opportunity to reconstruct the ranges of probable parameters to quantitatively describe the heavily eroded push moraine in terms of the primary topography, height and relative time frame within which it formed. In addition, the probable thermo-hydro-mechanical properties of the deformed strata are interpreted in terms of drained\/undrained conditions of volume strain evidenced by structural data and possibilities of lateral flow from beneath synclines into anticlines indicated by ADS-based balancing.\n               ","29":"\n                  This study elucidates the geological and physical factors that produce polymodal grain size distributions in two dunes systems in southeastern Oaxaca, Mexico. The dune systems are characterized by (1) small embryo vegetated, transverse and undeveloped dunes; and (2) tall types identified as barchanoid, parabolic, climbing and falling dunes. We performed a best-fit statistical Weibull distribution model with data obtained by laser granulometry to determine the polymodal trends of the coastal dune sands distribution. Polymodal distributions in small dunes arise from coarse and fine-grained sands mainly derived from the erosion of alluvial deposits composed of granitic and metasedimentary rock fragments (e.g., schists, orthogneiss and paragneiss). The medium- to fine-grained sands result from wind deflation, producing a heavy mineral lag. Conversely, the polymodal grain size distributions in the tall dunes are mainly derived from the physical weathering of granites, andesitic-tuff-lava flow marine sandstones (ATLMS), alluvial deposits, and metasedimentary rock fragments (e.g., schists, orthogneiss and paragneiss) due to the frequent storms and intense winds. We constructed binary plots of grain size parameters to compare the dune sand systems in Oaxaca with some others in Mexico. Based on the sedimentary results and the Weibull distributions, we conclude that the grain sizes of the coastal dune sands from Oaxaca, Mexico, are controlled by the sand composition, wind patterns, hydrodynamic conditions, weathering effects, and physical characteristics, regardless of the dune geomorphology. Evidence of multicycle aeolian transport of sand particles in the Oaxaca coastal dunes is supported by the compositional framework of the sands and the roundness of sand grains.\n               ","30":"\n                  A series of uncharacterised tufa deposits within the lowland volcanic provinces of western Saudi Arabia are investigated here in order to account for their presence and to examine their utility as a palaeoenvironmental archive. The Wadi Dabsa basin, in the Harrat Al Birk, is part of the Saharo-Arabian region, where there is increasing evidence for multiple hominin dispersals during windows of reduced aridity during the last ~400\u202fka of the Late Quaternary. This first and detailed petrological and geochemical characterisation of these tufa carbonates is particularly important for palaeoenvironmental and climatological reconstruction at a site that contains a major concentration of Early and Middle Stone Age artefacts. We aim to determine the nature of deposition, to answer whether these are cool, freshwater tufa or hydrothermal travertine, and to establish what the tufa settings, stratigraphies and facies reveal about the hydroclimatic regime in this semi-arid environment.\n                  A widespread lacustrine-paludal and fluvial tufa system is preserved, as well as topographically-controlled tufa barrages and cascades. Observable sections, exposed by incision, reveal a thickness of tufa deposits of 3 to 6\u202fm in places, which contain two packages of tufa-cemented conglomerate facies. This allows us to provide a conceptual model for the deposition of semi-arid tufa, based on existing type sites in the Naukluft Mountains of Namibia and the Ebro Basin of Spain. The varied topography within this volcanic harrat provides a setting at Wadi Dabsa that combines the low-lying lacustrine-paludal model from Spain with the steeper and higher-energy model from Namibia. The two tufa-cemented bedload units and the evidence for post-depositional erosion of other tufa facies indicates a shifting hydroclimatic regime, with episodes during which the basin contained water and there was steady flow in the fluvial channels, alternating with episodes of high-energy flashy flows.\n                  Geochemical analysis using 87Sr\/86Sr isotopic ratios (0.7049 to 0.7056 with one sample at 0.7062) and stable carbon isotopes (\u221212.9 to \u22126.3\u2030) reveal that these are cool-water tufas were deposited from meteoric water that has interacted with both metamorphosed limestone in the Asir Escarpment and the mafic metavolcanic bedrock of the Wadi Dabsa Basin, without a geothermal influence. These tufa are low-concentration\u2011magnesium calcite, with traces of quartz (to a maximum of 3%) and other silicates. Some samples have \u22647.5% palygorskite, which along with petrological evidence for microbial filaments suggests the importance of biomineralisation by cyanobacteria within some of these tufa. Petrological analysis shows the fabrics are dominated by micrite cements with some microspar, and very little post-depositional alteration. Where samples are banded, this reflects variation in calcite crystal size as opposed to any striking variations in mineralogical composition. Oxygen stable isotopic composition (\u221214.6 to \u22121.9\u2030) indicates deposition from an isotopically more depleted rainfall source than the modern day, noting additional corrections for unknown past temperature and any other fractionation effects are needed. Depleted rainfall sources in this region may relate to either a far-travelled Atlantic moisture source or a higher-intensity Indian Ocean monsoon source, or some combination.\n               ","31":"\n                  The relationships between fan deltas and their drainage basins have been extensively studied for the present day, but as far as we are aware of, studies have not yet been performed for the geologic record. This study examines the provenance of the Miocene Doumsan fan-delta system (17\u201310.5\u202fMa), Pohang Basin, southeast Korea, using combined detrital zircon and whole-rock geochemistry to understand the long-term development of the fan-delta system and its drainage basin. Of the lower five sequences of the Doumsan fan-delta, which were interpreted to have been controlled solely by eustasy, the lower sequences (sequences 1\u20133) show gradual expansion of the drainage basin without tectonic activity. In contrast, sequence 4 records an abrupt shrinkage of the drainage basin induced by uplift of the source area at ca. 15\u202fMa, which could have resulted from a regional collisional tectonic event that has not yet been recognised from the fan delta systems of the Pohang Basin, although palaeomagnetic studies and compositional changes of basalts of the basin suggest this event. Sequence 5 records a subsequent gradual expansion of the source area during tectonic quiescence. Warm and humid climatic conditions in East Asia during the middle Miocene would have resulted in a relatively large drainage basin. This study thus demonstrates how eustasy and tectonic subsidence as well as climate can control the drainage basins of fan-delta systems over timescales of several million years.\n               ","32":"\n                  New X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX) microanalysis on clay minerals are presented for Cretaceous\u2013Cenozoic sedimentary sections studied in the La Flecha and La Troya Sur creeks, located in the Argentine Precordillera. The characterization of clay mineral assemblages, including the discrimination of detrital and authigenic phases, allows inferences to be made about paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental conditions as well as the post-sedimentary history of these foreland clastic sedimentary depocenters. Mineralogical analyses carried out in the Cretaceous Ci\u00e9naga del R\u00edo Huaco Fm. and the Cenozoic Puesto La Flecha, Vallecito, Vinchina, and Zapallar Fms. show the presence of illites, smectites, illite\/smectite mixed-layer clays (I\/S, with R0 and R1 ordering types), sporadic corrensite, and subordinate amounts of chlorite and kaolinite, among other non-clay phases, such as analcime and heulandite. Illite and chlorite are interpreted as detrital phases, reflecting the composition of the source area, and smectite, I\/S R0 and R1, and corrensite are interpreted as authigenic phases developed in the matrix or as massive pore filling within the clastic levels. Compositional analyses allow for smectites to be characterized as di- and trioctahedral Mg-rich, and are interpreted as a product of the combination of two main controls: (1) that from the parent material (volcaniclastic material and magnesian silicates) and (2) that of the primary composition of pore fluids associated with alkaline lake systems. These smectites are precursors of prograde diagenetic phases developed under a low thermal regime (<120\u202f\u00b0C). R0 and R1 I\/S formed from Mg-dioctahedral smectites mainly within the matrix, with an increase of illite % in R0 and R1 with depth, and corrensite formed from trioctahedral Mg-smectites mainly as massive pore fillings. Finally, the conclusions obtained from these new data reinforce that, in some cases, authigenic phases associated with mesogenesis (e.g., corrensite) would allow us to make inferences about the precursor authigenic material and therefore about some paleoenvironmental conditions. This, in turn, underlies the importance of making detailed analyses of clay mineral assemblages in reconstructions of the sedimentary and post-sedimentary history of basins close to areas with active tectonism, such as foreland basins.\n               ","33":"\n                  An advection\u2013diffusion model of fluvial processes was used to analyze the stratigraphic expression of avulsions in terminal river systems and understand their control on basin-fill architecture. The initial and boundary conditions of the model runs (i.e., catchment area, smoothed initial topographic surface, grain-size distribution and sediment supply rates) were extracted from the modern Rio Colorado dryland terminal river system in the Altiplano Basin (Bolivia). Water-discharge and sediment-load values were derived from global regression curves and the BQART equation, respectively. To evaluate the robustness of the simulations, the model was tested under increasing sediment-load scenarios ranging from 0.003\u202fm3\/s to 0.095\u202fm3\/s. Data-model comparison provided insights into the role of avulsions in the geomorphological evolution of terminal river systems. The observed stacking of sediments, as captured by geospatial and geochronological data from the Rio Colorado, is consistent with the high sediment-load scenarios, which start with a single-thread fluvial channel that in time radially expands over the floodplain by successive river avulsions on account of alluvial-ridge aggradation and channel-floor elevation above the surrounding floodplain. The model output shows a laterally extensive, convex-upwards lobate topography which is in agreement with the lateral and longitudinal geomorphology in the upper and lower coastal plain of the Rio Colorado. The simulated inter-avulsion period, which is the time period between two successive full (or stabilized) avulsions in the model, varies from 0.18 to 1.2\u202fkyr and is consistent with the OSL-age determination in the Rio Colorado with inter-avulsion periods up to 1.28\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.34\u202fkyr.\n               ","34":"\n                  Distinct processes during the syn-depositional sedimentation and the post-depositional diagenesis determine the fabric of a clastic sedimentary rock. Temporal and spatial variations in any of these processes cause development of specialized characters in the sedimentary rocks. The Permian Barren Measures Formation in the Pranhita-Godavari Valley in southern peninsular India, is characterized by signatures of early to late diagenetic cementations within coarse-grained sandstones and mudstones. An integrated petrographic-geochemical study is carried out to understand the post-depositional near-surface and burial processes. Facies architecture manifests sedimentation in fluvial (channel, bar and overbank) to tide-influenced fluvio-tidal mixed depositional condition. Post-depositional near-surface early diagenesis changes include \u2013 (i) partial dissolution of detrital grains, (ii) biotite kaolinization, (iii) localized extensive ferruginous cementation, (iii) calcite cementation, and (iv) development of rhizocretions observed at different stratigraphic levels. These point to the role of meteoric water during the pre-burial stage that changed the pore water chemistry within the fluvial channel and bar sediments, along with onset of pedogenic (calcretization) processes in the vadose zone within the fine-grained overbank deposits. Marine (tidal) water influx in fluvial regime under a semi-arid climate modified the pore water chemistry. Shallow burial diagenetic changes, under elevated temperature and pressure include \u2013 (i) extensive calcite cementation in intergranular pore spaces and fractures, and (ii) late phase partial dissolution producing secondary porosity.

The coupling between ecological (extant community assemblage) and sedimentary processes (sediment composition and supply) that maintain these reef-fronted landforms make them increasingly sensitive to the impacts of future environmental change. To understand this interconnection we examine the benthic reef community assemblage and sediment characteristics (composition and texture) at Eva Island, an inshore turbid reef island system located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Benthic surveys and sediment composition identified molluscs as a unique primary sand-sized sediment constituent (34% of reef and sediments, respectively), alongside coral, despite low mollusc abundance in the reef ecology (n\u202f=\u202f94 extant individuals). This result, alongside homogeneity within reef and island biosedimentary facies, suggest a coupling between source (reef) and sink (island) environments may exist, with the sediment reservoir providing suitable sand-grade material for island nourishment. In light of these findings, assuming island building can keep up with rising sea levels, Eva may be resilient to the immediate impacts of climate change. However, dependency on a few primary sediment constituents (molluscs and coral that are sensitive to environmental perturbations) may compromise long-term resilience (over decades), particularly the direct effect on sediment producing habitats and sensitive calcifying organisms under future changing climatic conditions.\n               ","36":"\n                  The middle Santonian-lower Campanian carbonate-mud dominated succession deposited in the northeastern margin of the South Iberian Ramp (La Ca\u00f1adilla Fm, NE Spain) shows a complex set of interfingered facies developed in a low-energy and low-gradient shallow-marine to coastal environment. Three facies belts characterize the environment reconstructed in this work: (1) a low-energy shallow marine lagoon dominated by radiolitid rudist limestones and miliolid-rich facies with variable carbonate-mud content; (2) a transitional belt with a patchy distribution of ponds and mudbanks. This belt mostly consists of miliolid-rich limestones with variable amount of fenestral porosity, which are interfingered with charophytes and gastropod marls and limestones usually mixed with miliolids; (3) a coastal plain with strong freshwater influence characterized by the sedimentation of marls and limestones with charophytes, gastropods and root traces and intraclastic\/black pebble limestones. The studied succession is arranged in high-frequency sequences, including meter-scale parasequences bounded by widespread flooding surfaces, which stack in five larger-scale shallowing-upward sequences (6\u201320\u202fm thick). The time calibration of these sequences obtained from strontium isotopes and biostratigraphic data (benthic foraminifera) suggests a major control in the sedimentation by climate-driven low-amplitude sea level oscillations formed in tune with the long- and short-eccentricity orbital cycles. Cyclic sea level rises controlled the existence of widespread flooding events in the low-gradient carbonate ramp at the onset of parasequences, which in the studied marginal areas of the South Iberian Ramp were mostly sourced from the southern Tethyan realm. Therefore, the La Ca\u00f1adilla Fm provides an example of a complex shallow marine to coastal system giving rise to a mosaic distribution of carbonate-mud dominated facies, with sedimentation mostly influenced by external factors resulting in a well-defined stratigraphic architecture. The similarities with modern analogous systems such as the Ten Thousand Islands of the Florida Bay are discussed in this paper.\n               ","37":"\n                  Dust storms, which have become an environmental crisis in the Middle East in recent years, are associated with increased sources of sediment production. There are several reasons for the emergence of these sources, with the interplay between geomorphological processes and the production of landforms, which are susceptible to dust emission under certain conditions, being considered as its main reason. In this research, the most important dust production regions in Ilam province, located in the west of Iran, have been identified and their geomorphological characteristics have been analyzed in order to manage the environment. First, using MODIS images, applying the thermal-infrared dust index (TDI) and the HYSPLIT model during 21 dusty days from 2008 to 2013, the dust source areas were identified. Subsequently, a geomorphic map was produced and overlaid on the dust source map to determine the distribution and frequency of dust source points in each geomorphic class. Finally, field observations were conducted to analyze the geomorphological characteristics of the most important dust emission areas. The results revealed heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of dust sources in the area (235 points) concentrating in the regions of Mehran, Dehloran and Abu Ghovair where poor rangelands and agricultural lands predominate and abundant supplies of alluvial sediments exist. Indeed, dust mostly originates from landforms such as alluvial fans and floodplains whose dust-sized particles are renewed by seasonal floods annually. Thus, the availability of fine particles (clay and silt) in various geomorphic units plays a significant role in determining the dust emission capacity.\n               ","38":"\n                  Sediments originated from volcanic-hydrothermal activities show clear relationship with hydrocarbon generation and accumulation in fine-grained sedimentary rocks at a regional scale. However, the fundamental processes and mechanisms of this relationship are still poorly understood at a microscopic scale to hamper efficient hydrocarbon exploration. In addition, coarse grains common in volcanic lacustrine fine-grained sediments have been traditionally interpreted as diagenetic products during early and late burial. Our study, however, suggests that coarse calcite grains are not diagenetic, but formed by subaqueous explosion. The calcite grains occur in lacustrine fine-grained sedimentary rocks in the middle Permian Lucaogou Formation in the Santanghu intracontinental rift basin, NW China. They are sand sized, angular, mono- and polycrystalline, and discretely scatter in silt to clay-sized non-calcite pyroclastic matrix. The calcite grains and the mud matrix are interpreted as a pyroclastic debris flow deposit. In-situ 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (0.704932\u20130.705840, and 0.705137 on average) of the calcite grains are similar to those of mantle rocks, indicating an origin closely related to mantle-derived fluids. The in-situ \u03b413C values (4.24\u2030 to 5.06\u2030, and 4.57\u2030 on average) and extremly negative \u03b418O values (\u221221.70\u2030 to \u221221.18\u2030, and\u202f\u2212\u202f21.49\u2030 on average) indicate that extensive hydrothermal alteration and microbial activities influenced the formation of the calcite. Element composition and homogenizaiton temperature of fluid incusions of calcite and biomarkers of the mudstone all suggest a relatively low-temperature hydrothermal condition in a saline and reducing environment. Furthermore, hydrocarbon-rich inclusions are rich in the calcite grains and have two modes of occurrence and maturity. They indicate that the organic matter was generated from algae bloom, which was caused by volcanic-hydrothermal activities. Alternatively, the hydrocarbon may have an inorganic origin originated from a mantle source. Our findings provide an alternative interpretation on the origin of coarse calcite grains in fine-grained sedimentary rocks and demonstrate a microscopic relationship between volcanic-hydrothermal activities and hydrocarbon generation and accumulation in a tectonic active rift basin.\n               ","39":"\n                  In organic-rich mudstones, vertical sequences of sedimentary facies record the depositional responses to complex and varying controls: development of accommodation, redox conditions and multiple sources of detrital and biogenic sediments whose flux varies with relative sea-level, and reworking by bottom currents. In this study of the Upper Devonian Duvernay Formation in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, we utilize dense core and well log control to characterize lithofacies and develop a sequence stratigraphic model for the formation, accounting for paleogeographic features whose effects on facies varied during three complete 3rd order sea level cycles. We further identify features characteristic of mudstone sequence boundaries, describe how they vary stratigraphically and geographically, and interpret processes responsible for their formation. These observations provide a framework for interpreting vertical successions in mudstones from lower density datasets.\n                  Five lithofacies are identified, deposited by combinations of suspension settling, sediment-gravity flows, and bottom currents under anoxic to fully oxygenated bottom water conditions. Lithofacies distribution was strongly affected by proximity to sediment sources, bottom topography, and sea level cyclicity. Relatively coarse-grained, carbonate-rich, bioturbated, and organic-poor facies are common close to large carbonate platforms and reefs; silt- and sand-rich facies deposited by bottom currents and sediment gravity flows are common on the slopes of carbonate platforms; hemipelagic, fine grained, biosiliceous, organic-rich facies are common in distal areas of the basin.\n                  The Duvernay was deposited during a 2nd order transgression and early 2nd order highstand comprising three 3rd order depositional sequences and nine 4th order depositional sequences. Third order transgressive deposits are characterized by upward trends of increasingly fine-grained, biosiliceous, organic-rich facies. Third order highstand deposits are characterized by increasingly coarse-grained, carbonate-rich, bioturbated, organic-poor facies. Third order lowstand deposits are characterized by detrital clay-rich, bioturbated facies. The expressions of 3rd order sequence boundaries vary with geographic position in the basin and stratigraphic positions within the 2nd order depositional sequence. In the 2nd order transgression, sequence boundaries are expressed as scoured surfaces with coarse overlying lags that represent sediment starvation and reworking. In the 2nd order highstand, sequence boundaries are underlain by coarse beds with soft sediment-deformed bases deposited during a forced regression.\n               ","40":"\n                  Sand beaches occur along the southern and eastern coasts of the Baltic Sea, and their sediments serve as an excellent archive of the past environment. In this study, we explore four beach locations in Poland and Latvia, taking a special interest in their sediments at the microscale. We determine sediment properties, potential extreme event records and type of transportation by applying grain-size analysis, and analysis of shape and character of sand grain surfaces under a binocular microscope and in a Camsizer M1 automated particle shape analyser, followed by statistical analysis. For a large dataset (of grains), the statistical approach reveals sediment grain characteristics that are hidden when looking at results in a traditional way. This approach allows a new textural code to be proposed that helps identify beach evolution and sedimentary environment conditions. Additionally, we define the threshold sphericity values for incidental storm records, and conversely, for long-lasting transportation and mature beach sediments, which are 0.8 and 0.9228, respectively. Both the textural code and threshold values can be utilised in sandy beach settings elsewhere. All in all, we detect (1) beaches with mature sediments that have experienced long-lasting transportation and reworking, (2) beaches and ancient beach ridges with medium sediment reworking and sediment mixing due to medium transport duration and pedestrian traffic, respectively, and (3) beaches that combine records of incidental storm events with grain inheritance from pre-Quaternary environments.\n               ","41":"\n                  A short episode (~170 kyr) of extremely high global temperatures that occurred ~56\u202fMa, known as the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum, is widely considered an ancient analogue of the ongoing anthropogenic warming. This ancient hyperthermal event consisted of three phases, onset, core and recovery, which are respectively represented in the mid-latitude south Pyrenean Tremp-Graus Basin by three successive terrestrial units, the Claret Conglomerate, the Yellowish Soils and the Gypsum-rich Unit, each of them recording a different sedimentary response to evolving climatic and hydrological regimes. The Claret Conglomerate is mainly made up of calcareous conglomerates and is acknowledged to record an abrupt hydrological change during the onset phase. This unit most likely formed in an alluvial megafan, an interpretation here reinforced with new architectural information and by comparison with naturally occurring small-scale fan-like accumulations. Assuming the similarity between the onset of the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum and the anthropogenic warming, recent hydrological and meteorological data from mid-latitude Spain were compiled for comparison purposes. This comparison concurs with published modelling results about hydroclimate changes in the Pyrenees during the hyperthermal event, postulating an enhancement of seasonal contrast with augmented frequency and intensity of floods but no significant change in total rain. Furthermore, the comparison suggests that the Claret Conglomerate accumulated during extreme rainfall episodes that mainly occurred in autumn. The Yellowish Soils are mostly composed of silty marls with ubiquitous small-sized carbonate nodules and intercalated calcarenites. The marls were deposited in floodplains and the calcarenites in point bars and crevasse splays of meandering rivers. The scarcity of conglomerates entails a near absence of strong currents, and the carbonate nodules perennial or seasonal arid conditions. These nodules occur within cumulate palaeosols, the development of which required regular sedimentary increments during inundations on the floodplains. Sedimentation rates of siliciclastic material on the floodplains increased significantly during the core of the hyperthermal event, as well as at river outlets in coastal settings, which shows that erosion was accelerated and rules out the occurrence of protective, dense vegetation. Combined, these characteristics suggest persistent very dry summers, but a smooth wet season without intense precipitation events. Lastly, the profusion of gypsum in the youngest unit is clear proof of an arid climate during the recovery of the hyperthermal event. In essence, the studied deposits provide a unique window into the sequence of hydroclimatic change during the rise, peak and decline of an ancient global warming event in a mid-latitude terrestrial setting, against which ongoing climate-change data and future projections can be compared.\n               ","42":"\n                  Strata deposited in middle carbonate ramps are often highly burrowed. Such strata are easy to recognize in the stratigraphic record and have been recorded from numerous stratigraphic sections worldwide. However, the spatial patterns of these strata are poorly known, despite being intervals of flow zones in many hydrocarbon reservoirs and water aquifers. In this study, we trace one stratum (in the upper Hanifa Formation, central Saudi Arabia) that was deposited in the middle carbonate ramp of the Late Jurassic for ~21\u202fkm, cored it in three localities, and investigated its spatial stratigraphic, sedimentological and ichnological patterns by field investigation and laboratory analysis (petrographic analysis and computer tomography (CT) scanning). The results of the field investigation show that the stratum has a similar spatial stratigraphic pattern over the study area (sharp contacts with the underlying and overlying strata), suggesting one depositional cycle product. Nevertheless, the laboratory analysis revealed that the stratum varies spatially and distinctly in rock composition, burrow percentage (BP), and burrowing style, suggesting various controls on its rock texture. The bottom interval of the stratum comprises wackestone and packstone rock texture which are interpreted as a product of bio-retexturing that took place at the time of the initial flooding stage of the deposition cycle. In the middle (5% to 10% BP) and upper intervals (20% to 40% BP), the stratum has mudstone and wackestone host rock matrix penetrated by a Thalassinoides burrow network (pipe framework) with passive infills (grain-dominated carbonates). The stratum exhibits both vertical and lateral variations in burrow percentage and burrowing styles, which are interpreted to be controlled by variations in bathymetry due to sea-level change and seafloor topography. Such variations influenced the rock texture of the studied stratum and would eventually control the spatial patterns of its petrophysical properties. The results provide insights into the nature and controls on the spatial patterns of burrowed strata of a middle ramp carbonate, patterns that can be similar to many hydrocarbon reservoirs and can be used to predict the distribution of petrophysical properties.\n               ","43":"\n                  The Lower Shihezi Formation, situated in the south of the Chinese Ordos Basin, is a tight sandstone reservoir that is generally influenced by its sedimentary facies and diagenesis, corresponding to distinct petrophysical reservoir properties for each lithofacies type. The existing lithofacies types within the Lower Shihezi Formation were determined through observations in field profiles and drill cores that were combined with the analysis of logging data. Diagenetic processes and their effects were analyzed by using different methods, such as conventional thin section, cast thin section, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses. The results of this contribution indicate that the Lower Shihezi Formation in the southern Ordos Basin is dominated by braided delta facies and locally developed lacustrine facies. During diagenesis of this studied formation, compaction and cementation led to a reduction in porosity with compaction probably forming the main factor. Existing cementation is mainly manifested in the form of clay mineral cements, siliceous and carbonate cements, and induced a somewhat lower pore reduction effect on the reservoir compared to compaction. Minor dissolution led to the break-down of rock fragments, feldspars, and other soluble minerals, and thereby may have caused a subsequent formation of secondary pores, thus effectively improving the reservoir property. Consequently, due to the compositional differences and corresponding unique diagenetic effects, the distributary channels and underwater distributary channels display the highest reservoir properties.

As a result of their global reproducibility and similar geometry, these signals have predominantly been interpreted as being representative of the original \u03b413C values of dissolved inorganic carbon in the oceans, which in turn reflect major changes in the global carbon cycle. In this paper \u03b413C values from cores drilled in Enewetak Atoll (Pacific) and the Great Bahama Bank (Atlantic), are shown as examples of how similarly correlating variations in global \u03b413C values, can arise from diagenetic processes.

Geochemical traits including carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopes of these sequences are measured in three wells from the Abadan Plain and one well from the Dezful Embayment. The altered intervals below the exposed erosional surfaces are characterized by remarkable variations in both elemental and isotopic compositions.

We measured the \u03b413Corg of 79 surface soil samples collected from the upper and middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river basin (YZRB), southern Tibetan Plateau, in order to explore their spatial variations and environmental implications. The soil \u03b413Corg values range from \u221228.1\u2030 to \u221215.2\u2030, with an average of \u221222.8\u2030 and a modal value of around \u221225\u2030 to \u221223\u2030. Higher \u03b413Corg values occur in the central part of the YZRB (Lazi-Nedong) and lower \u03b413 Corg values occur in the western (Gar-Lazi) and eastern (Nedong-Bomi) parts. The variations in soil \u03b413Corg are significantly correlated with altitude (with a boundary at ~3500\u202fm\u202fa.s.l.). The co-variation of temperature and precipitation is responsible for the effect of altitude on soil \u03b413Corg, with temperature (mainly warmest season temperature) being the main controlling factor above 3500\u202fm\u202fa.s.l., and precipitation the main factor below 3500\u202fm\u202fa.s.l.. Higher absolute values of the regression coefficients for the relationships between soil \u03b413Corg and altitude (\u22125.1\u2030\/km) and with mean annual temperature (+0.56\u2030\/\u00b0C) above 3500\u202fm may be due to the higher proportion of C4 plants in the central part of the YZRB, making it necessary to avoid the influence of C4 plants when using soil \u03b413Corg to reconstruct altitude or temperature. However, soil \u03b413Corg may be useful for precipitation reconstruction below 3500\u202fm\u202fa.s.l., where C3 plants dominate.\n               ","49":"\n                  The basin-and-range evolution of Northeast China could provide a comprehensive understanding of the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. The Songliao Basin preserved the essential and complete records of the Cretaceous tectonic evolution. The systematic detrital zircon UPb geochronological study was conducted on the Cretaceous sequences in the southern Songliao Basin, including Yingcheng Formation, Denglouku Formation, Quantou Formation, Qingshankou Formation, Yaojia Formation, Nenjiang Formation from bottom to up, providing new insights of provenances and tectonic evolution of the basin-range system. The Aptian and Albian sequences with the dominant age populations at ca. 133\u2013125\u202fMa were derived from the Great Xing'an Range (GXAR). The Cenomanian and Early Turonian sequences with the distinct age populations at ca. 243\u2013227\u202fMa received the source from the southernmost part of the Zhangguangcai Range (ZGCR). The Late Turonian to Campanian sequences experienced the gradual provenance transition to the GXAR. The main interim period with the dominant peaks at ca.1.8 and 2.5\u202fGa, and subdominant peaks at ca. 277\u202fMa, reveals the provenances from the southern margin, including the Inner Mongolia Paleo-Uplift (IMPU) and northern North China craton (NNCC) during the Late Turonian to Early Santonian. Since then, the provenance was skewed towards the GXAR manifesting the distinct age populations at ca. 139\u202fMa. The multi-provenance transitions reveal two orogeneses of the GXAR and ZGCR with the difference of 9\u202fMa. The gradual uplift from north to south in the Jiamusi Massif and the ZGCR at ca. 120\u201390\u202fMa was related to magmatic activity under the transition from the low angle subduction to slab rollback of the Pacific-Plate. The integral uplift of the GXAR at ca. 90\u201383.8\u202fMa was related to the transient compression due to the changes in direction and convergence rate of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. The compression-induced uplift was more intense than magmatism-induced uplift. Our findings can contribute to a better understanding of the basin-and-range evolution of Northeast China and the response to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate.\n               ","50":"\n                  The stratigraphic architecture of Upper Holocene sediments along the coast of Al Qahmah in southern Red Sea, Saudi Arabia, provides a high-resolution analog of marginal marine carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentation under variable climatic, tectonic, and sea-level conditions. The sediments include a basal shallow marine limestone and overlying beach, deltaic, fluvial, eolian, and sabkha siliciclastic deposits, comprising four stratigraphic units ranging from 10s to 100\u202fs\u202fcm thick. A lithostratigraphy is established using subsurface stratigraphic and petrographic data from 64 trenches and three shallow refraction seismic sections. A chronostratigraphy is established using four age points and sedimentation rates. The entire interval has been deposited in the last ~4000\u202fyears. Significant stratigraphic variability is reflected by vertical and lateral changes in the thickness, type, and stratal geometry of the four units. Five major geological events are interpreted: Initial shallow marine carbonate deposition during a relative sea-level highstand was terminated by seaward progradation of deltaic-beach sediments during a slow shoreline regression. This is followed by a major stream channel incision during the maximum regression and a relative sea-level fall. The ensuing fluvial channel filling, transgressive ravinement, and deposition of beach sediments signify a relative sea-level rise. Finally, eolian, sabkha, and beach sediments have been deposited in a stabilized and diversified environmental setting under an arid climate. The lacuna associated with stream erosion and transgressive ravinement is up to ~400\u202fyears long, resulting in a stratigraphic completeness of ~88%. The sedimentation rate of the siliciclastic sediments is ~0.1\u202fcm\/year estimated at a scale of 1000s of years. Episodic syn-depositional faulting in the source area and depositional site, relative seal-level change, autogenic environmental shift, and\/or climatic changes between humid and arid conditions have collectively played variable roles in the formation of the stratigraphic variability. The interpreted tectonic, relative sea-level, and climatic trends offer an important data point for future studies in the Red Sea region and beyond for the Late Holocene.\n               ","51":"\n                  The late Paleocene to earliest Eocene sedimentary record in the eastern Tremp-Graus Basin (southern Pyrenees, Spain) consists of a mud-prone fluvial succession informally known as \u2018Upper Red Garumnian\u2019, which is dominantly composed of non-channelized deposits interspersed with fluvial channel bodies. The succession records evidence of variations in water discharge at multiple temporal scales. One-hundred-and-eighty sand-prone and conglomeratic bodies present within otherwise fine-grained deposits have been examined by facies and architectural-element analyses. These have been assigned to four distinctive types: (i) simple and (ii) compound channelized deposits, (iii) multilateral and multistorey elements, and (iv) sediment gravity-flow deposits. Simple and compound channel bodies represent deposits of channelized high-energy flows associated respectively with single floods or multiple events occurring in the same channel belt. Multilateral and multistorey elements are associated with sedimentation in longer-lived channel belts. An increase in the occurrence of these latter elements through the stratigraphy can be related to changes in tectonic and\/or climatic drivers, heralding a change in facies architecture that signifies a shift to perennial discharge conditions and incised-valley backfilling. This is itself followed by a marked change in architectural style in a part of stratigraphy recording the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), when variations in precipitation regime and\/or intrabasinal characteristics (e.g., vegetation) related to this event favoured the lateral migration of channels, causing the development of laterally extensive coarse-grained bodies. Floodplain sediments comprise (i) heterolithic deposits accumulated in the vicinities of the fluvial channels where riparian ecosystems were developed, and (ii) overbank mudstones with variable degree of pedogenesis, especially associated with wetting and drying cycles in areas of the floodplain located distally away from fluvial channels. This succession records the importance of water-discharge variations in the evolution of alluvial systems: it displays facies arrangements recording the effects of highly variable discharge in ephemeral to perennial channels, as well as variations in stratigraphic architecture testifying to longer-term hydrological changes in the late Paleocene and earliest Eocene.\n               ","52":"\n                  Unraveling the failure history of submarine slides and delineating its environmental controls are crucial for practical hazard assessments, but are commonly challenging and costly. Here we address this challenge by investigating the Goliath slide complex, one of the largest documented slide scars on the ~200\u202fkm long continental slope offshore Israel. Geophysical evidence suggest that the Goliath complex is a relatively young feature. However, despite its proximity to submarine infrastructure and to one of the most populated coastal areas in the Mediterranean, its recent temporal development was never determined.\n                  Based on a detailed analysis of sub-meter resolution multi-channel seismic profiles, four sediment cores were retrieved from the northern head scarp and toe domains of the Goliath slide complex. Selective sedimentological and chronological analyses were carried out following a detailed computed tomography analysis of the cores. The results reveal two generations of deposits on the northern head scarp of Goliath, separated by a detachment surface. Two 14C ages of 7.46\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13\u202fcal\u202fka BP (core PHS-1) and 7.38\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.16\u202fcal\u202fka BP (core PHS-5) were obtained for the sediments immediately overlying this surface, implying that the Goliath northern head scarp was formed, at least in part, during a substantial ~7.4\u202fcal\u202fka BP event. A ~3.7 kyrs hiatus within the late Holocene sedimentary sequence of core PHS-5 may suggest an additional, more recent and presumably smaller, slide event that occurred at ~2.4\u202fka BP. The sedimentary succession from Goliath's toe domain (core PTL-3), located ~32\u202fkm downslope from the head scarp, show an upper 1.2\u202fm long continuous undisturbed sequence dated to the last ~14\u202fka BP and including sapropel S1 deposits. This sequence overlies three disturbed units, interpreted as mass transport deposits (MTDs) containing various deformation features, large-scale burrows, sharp contacts and fold structures. A 14C age dates the base of the hemipelagic sequence to 13.91\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23\u202fcal\u202fka BP, representing the minimum age of the slide event that deposited this MTD. Ages within the MTD units are substantially older (18.21\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.27 to 28.66\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.33\u202fcal\u202fka BP) than in the overlying sequence and an age-inversion within the MTDs supports their interpretation as transported sediments.\n                  The timing of the prominent slide events in the Goliath complex corresponds with the late stages of meltwater pulses 1A (~14.6\u201313.7\u202fka BP) and 1C (~8.2\u20137.5\u202fka BP), periods of accelerated sea level rise and probably increased sediments supply. Our results suggest that climate-driven factors likely contributed significantly to slope instability in this area, while earthquakes on the Dead Sea Transform may have been the triggering factor for the Goliath Slide events.\n               ","53":"\n                  In this paper, we formally define a series of bioclastic eolianites and protosols exposed on high-energy bank margins throughout the Bahamas archipelago as the Whale Point Formation (WPF). The position of this new lithostratigraphic unit above and seaward of deposits dated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e and below Holocene sediments constrains its age to the latest Pleistocene, more precisely to MIS 5a (ca. 88\u201374\u202fka BP). This age is further corroborated by amino-acid racemization data calibrated with UTh ages. Based on their sedimentological characteristics, the WPF eolianites are interpreted as landward-advancing dunes decoupled from their source beaches. Relying on the faunal content, the maximum elevation of relative sea level during MIS 5a can be roughly estimated at ca. 9\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202fm below the present stand. The WPF includes two phases of eolian deposition separated by an interval of negative sediment budget and pedogenesis. These different facies possibly reflect millennial-scale sea-level and climate instability during MIS 5a, the latter being likely related to shifts in the mean annual position of the intertropical convergence zone and associated rainfall belt.\n               ","54":"\n                  Growth folds developed at rift margin transfer zones are mostly studied for their structural style and stratal architecture. The influence of the growth of these folds on the syn-rift sedimentary facies development, however, remains less documented. To address this, we investigated the syn-rift facies of the Lower Miocene Rudeis Formation in relation to the growth of structures within the North Baba transfer zone at the eastern margin of the Suez rift. Sedimentological analysis defined seven facies associations in three successive depositional systems: (i) gravel-rich submarine fans with up-dip thinning geometry, comprising upper, middle and lower fan facies associations, (ii) a gravitationally modified Gilbert-type fan delta, with tangential foreset and bottomset. Both fan systems pass gradationally into basinal marl-dominated facies, and (iii) shoreface-to-offshore. Paleocurrent measurements and the spatial facies variability indicate that the North Baba transfer zone was acting as the main sediment fairway conveying the sediments southwards from the adjacent rift shoulder to the Baba hangingwall syncline. Mapping of key stratal surfaces and growth structures helped in distinguishing four lower Rudeis stratal units, which provide a framework for studying the spatial and vertical relationships among the recognized facies. Deposition of these stratal units was influenced by progressive steepening and localized faulting of a fault-tip growth monocline above the North Baba transfer zone and a submerged intrabasinal high. These structures controlled the hangingwall gradient, bathymetry, flow pathways and facies relations, triggered multiple gravity flows and slumps, and created terraces on which patch reefs and localized shoreface deposits intermittently developed. This study reveals that the transfer zone was still acting as growth monocline even during the rift-climax. The coeval deposits were mainly sourced from a hinterland drainage catchment rather than local footwall scarps. They form progressively tilted clastic wedges that onlap and pinch out up-dip toward the growth monocline, unlike those observed at faulted margins where the facies commonly thicken toward the fault.\n               ","55":"\n                  The upper part of the Austin Chalk (AC-B1 subunit), as seen in a series of cores in areas of the Maverick Basin and San Marcos Arch in south-central Texas, contains a stratigraphic section of mass-wasting complexes resulting from penecontemporaneous volcanic-induced gravity-flow deposition. The types of gravity flows are variable in composition depending on sources of volcanic or carbonate sediments available and position of initiation of the flow on the volcanic mounds.\n                  The gravity flows occurred in a deeper-water drowned-shelf setting where argillaceous chalk-rich sediments were being deposited. The mafic volcanoes are part of the Balcones Igneous Province that was active during very Late Santonian to Early Campanian time. Some of the volcanoes formed mounds that created elevated areas in the photic zone or above sea level. In the shallow-water photic zones, carbonate factories formed as atolls and shoals. These carbonate factories were a source for shallow-water allochems, and along with the volcanic debris, constituted gravity flows that were likely triggered by volcanic-associated earthquakes. As gravity flows moved downslope, they eroded deeper-water, bottom sediments, which were incorporated into the flows. The two major transport mechanisms were debris flows and hyperconcentrated-density flows.\n                  The debrites appear as two types: those dominated by mud clasts and those dominated by cm-scale skeletal fragments such as inoceramid or disarticulated oyster shells. The clasts in the mud-clast-dominant debrites range in rigidity from very soft (i.e., easily deformed) to firm (i.e., resist deformation and preserved burrows). Since the mud clasts are composed of planktic foraminifers and calcispheres in a coccolith-hash matrix, they are assumed to have originated from the deeper flanks of the volcanic mounds. The rigidity of the mud clasts are likely related to initial (i.e., early) depth of burial of the unlithified mud.\n                  The skeletal-dominated debrites with disarticulated oyster shells appear to have been sourced from the upper slopes of the volcanic mounds and underwent little abrasion during debris-flow transportation. The inoceramid-fragment-dominated debrites may have been initiated lower on the volcanic mounds where these low-oxygen-tolerating bivalves would dominate the macrofauna.\n                  The hyperconcentrated-density-flow deposits are grain-rich in skeletal fragments with a mixture of shallow- and deep-water biota, suggesting some direct sourcing from shallow-water shoals and later incorporation of deeper-water sediments from the flanks of the volcanic mounds. These hyperconcentrated-density-flow deposits are positioned close to the base of the mounds.\n                  This distinct stratigraphic interval varies greatly from the rest of the Austin Chalk section in the Maverick Basin and San Marcos Arch areas. Deeper-water chalk deposition was the general background environmental setting, but it was disrupted by this period of volcanism that initiated numerous mass-wasting complexes punctuating the deeper-water chalk deposits. Within the gravity-flow deposits, volcanic components such as lapilli, ash, and glauconite-altered volcanic grains occurred along with both shallow- and deep-water carbonate allochems. Investigation of this stratigraphic unit within the Austin Chalk provides an analog for mass-wasting complexes associated with active volcanism and explains the variations in composition of the gravity-flow deposits.\n               ","56":"\n                  Rapid changes in paleoclimate in the Early Cretaceous had profound impacts on the global ecosystem, which is recorded not only in marine sediments but also in coeval sediments deposited in continental lake systems. This study performed the lake sedimentary characteristics and paleontological data of the upper member of Bayingebi Formation (K1b2) of Lower Cretaceous in the Yin'e Basin (North China) and revealed the paleoclimate disturbances and the evolution of paleovegetation and paleoenvironment recorded in the continental lake. The sediments of K1b2 can be divided into 10 kinds of lithofacies according to grain size, sedimentary structure and overall lithofacies. The three lithofacies associations are nearshore subaqueous fan, semi-deep lake\/deep lake and shallow lake respectively. Seventy-eight palynomorph genera and two hundred and thirty-one palynomorph species were identified in the K1b2 samples, which allowed distinguishing 3 palynozones. The sporopollen spectrum and the ecological characteristics of sporopollen parent plants indicate that there was abundant temperate coniferous forest vegetation during the deposition of Bayingebi Formation. The mixed phenomenon of a few cold-loving molecular spores and pollen such as spruce, cedar and fir with tropical and subtropical spores and pollen suggest vertical zoning of plants. It is inferred that the ground shape and height difference around Yin'e Basin in Early Cretaceous is large, and there may be paleogeomorphic features of high mountains, and the paleoclimate has vertical zoning. The K1b2 depositional period was mainly in the warm temperate-temperate paleoclimate background, and oil shale was mainly developed in the semi-humid warm temperate climate. The suitable paleotemperature and the sedimentary environment of semi-deep lake\/deep lake provide rich organic matter sources and good preservation conditions for the formation of oil shale. The dropstone structures commonly found in the lower strata of the oil shale member of the Bayingebi Formation in the study area were deposited in a semi-humid temperate climate and were inferred to be ice-rafting deposits, which may be related to a brief climatic cooling event or seasonal freezing during the Early Cretaceous in northern China. The typical East Asian paleontological fossils (Jehol Biota) and lacustrine hydrocarbon source rocks developed in the Early Cretaceous in the study area were affected by the paleoclimate warming in the early Aptian, which was closely related to the increase of global CO2 concentration in this period.\n               ","57":"\n                  This study combines published isotope data (223 samples) with new data (153 samples) on the \u03b434S and \u03b418O composition of Ca-sulfate rocks (anhydrite and secondary gypsum) accumulated in eastern Iberia during the Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic. The \u03b434S mean values of the evaporite units reveal the following trends: a decrease from the lower Anisian (~18\u2030) to the Carnian-Norian interval (~15\u2030); an increase at the Rhaetian (~16\u2030); a decrease in the Hettangian-Sinemurian interval (~14\u2030); and finally an increasing trend from the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian (~16\u2030) to the Pliensbachian-Toarcian (~19\u2030). This \u03b434S isotope assemblage together with the generalized low standard deviations observed for the different evaporite units is consistent, and suggests that the isotope composition of these Ca-sulfates are primary signatures related to feeding marine water sulfate. Depending on the evaporite units, these \u03b434S mean values are, nevertheless, ~1\u2030 to ~3\u2030 lower than those reported for coeval Triassic evaporites of the Germanic basin and the Alp-Apennine domains. In eastern Iberia, the \u03b418O values are more variable and also display wider scatters than the corresponding \u03b434S values. Of particular interest in our study are: (i) the low \u03b434S values for the Anisian in comparison with those in the Germanic basin; (ii) the shift to heavier values in the Rhaetian, recorded for first time in the evaporites of eastern Iberia; (iii) the low values observed for the Hettangian, which suggest that the change to the heavier values of the Jurassic (~19\u2030) occurred after the end-Hettangian in eastern Iberia; and (iv) the affinity of the \u03b434S values recorded for the Hettangian-Sinemurian interval to those known for the Canadian domain.\n               ","58":"\n                  Our research investigates the control of stylolites on fluid flow in dolostone host rocks in the Irankuh Zn-Pb world-class deposit located in Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone, Iran. Core samples from the north flank of this zone, originating from the Gushfil, Rowmarmar, and Tappehsorkh mines, were examined (macro- and microscopically) with respect to the different types of stylolites and their relationship to mineralization. The stylolites are mostly sutured with sharp peaks with simple wavy-like outlines. Tectonic stylolites are increasing in number toward ore intervals while burial stylolites usually occur in fine dolostones and clearly relate to the type of lithology. The stylolites in Irankuh often act as flow conduits which became enriched in residue solid hydrocarbon and in ore minerals (sphalerite and galena) toward intervals enriched in ores. The associated re-activation of stylolites resulted from tectonic forces and bulging. In conjunction, the injection of overpressured fluids formed intensely fractured and hydrothermal brecciated dolostone corridors. The abundance, typology, and re-activation of stylolites in Irankuh with respect to the tectonic regime support an epigenetic origin, which contrasts with the syn-sedimentary origin proposed in literature.

The relatively small extent of the platform allows a detailed study of facies and ecological variations, to determine the controlling factors for the growth and evolution of the platform (tectonics, glacioeustatism, terrigenous input), as well as the particular environmental\/ecological conditions for the formation of microbial buildups and oolitic shoals (turbidity, energy, nutrients, chemical variations).\n                  Although microbial mounds are well-known during the Palaeozoic, the close relationship with ooids, as observed in the studied succession, is unusual, particularly for the frequent ooids embedded in the microbial facies, an ecological parameter used by previous authors to identified shallower stages in the microbial growths.\n                  Petrographic analysis of the ooids, as well as their ecological conditioning, suggest that less than 40% of samples yield ooids generated in situ, whereas there is a predominance of transported ooids. Ooids formed in situ, which include large irregular and elongated ooids, were generated in calmer water than the typical rounded and egg-shaped ooids. The occurrence of the predominant types of ooids in shallower-water grainstones with in situ generation, and in the deepest-water microbial facies, suggest their ease of transport. The higher production of ooids occurs during the shallowing phases of the cycles, whereas they were more easily transported during the deepening phases, whereas in the microbial buildups, no features of in situ ooid generation are found.\n               ","60":"\n                  The Norian succession of the Southern Alps of Italy stores thick successions of resedimented basinal carbonates (Zorzino Limestone) that were deposited in fault-controlled, anoxic, intraplatform basins developed within a vast inner platform domain (Dolomia Principale). To characterise the basinal facies, to define their distribution within these basins and to identify depositional processes, four stratigraphic logs covering about 2000\u202fm of total stratigraphic thickness from proximal to distal basinal settings were described bed by bed. Eight different lithofacies organised in 11 bed types were identified according to sedimentary structures, texture, and composition: each bed (about 4500 beds in total) was measured individually at cm scale and classified in one of the 11 bed types.\n                  Distribution of bed types in terms of events (i.e. number of beds) and cumulative thickness (i.e. volume of sediments produced by the different depositional processes) in the four selected logs change from the proximal to the distal parts of the basin, reflecting the existence of diverse dominant depositional processes at different places within the intraplatform basins. Bed by bed analyses of thick stratigraphic logs provide important hints about the distribution of different types of depositional processes, from proximal to distal basin. Frequent slump folds and mass flow deposits, with clasts mostly deriving from the slope facies itself, indicate instability of the slope. Sediment composition and facies types document a major role played by the reworking of primary deposits formed along the slope: basinal facies mostly consist of resedimented slope deposits, produced by sliding of sediments, rich in lime mud, accumulated along the slope and low-angle proximal basin, whose instability (likely enhanced by seismic activity related to the Norian extensional tectonics) produced most of the recognised facies types. The two-step depositional processes as well as the facies associations and bed types clearly indicate a different behaviour (in terms of prevailing depositional processes and facies associations) of the studied resedimented limestone with respect to siliciclastic deposits.\n                  The distribution of facies and the detailed analyses of bed types, recording the distribution of depositional processes at basinal scale, provide a tool for the interpretation of basin morphology, from the study of stratigraphic logs, that can be applied both to outcrop and to subsurface successions.\n               ","61":"\n                  Studies of seismically triggered deformations in the depositional record contribute significantly to our knowledge of earthquake recurrence over geological time. This paper describes soft sediment deformation structures preserved in a periglacial Upper Pleistocene succession of eolian sand in the eastern Vienna Basin, Central Europe. The strata were formed dominantly by wind ripples migrating across a sand sheet, less frequently by deposition of fine-grained sand and silt from suspension during decreased wind speed and by small-scale eolian dunes. Most prominent deformations observed are collapse wedges, which are interpreted as being formed along dilatational fractures. Further detected deformations include chaotically disturbed strata, folded strata, and a pop-up structure caused by sliding. The tensile fractures are oriented systematically in a prevailing N\u2013S direction, perpendicular to the W\u2013E extension suggested for the transtensional Vienna Basin Transfer Fault, which underlies the study area. Repeated seismic shock is identified as the trigger of the deformations. The mechanism of deformation implies some degree of cohesion within the deformed strata, and this may be attributed to seasonal frost and the presence of vadose water within the upper levels of the sediment. These deformations appear periodically, in 25 distinct horizons of strata internally deformed by collapse wedges, and in 40 horizons if deformation both by collapse wedges and\/or chaotically disturbed beds is considered. The vertical distribution of deformations allowed the calculation of the recurrence periods of earthquakes with the use of a Bayesian age-depth model; this, in turn, was based on seven OSL ages. The calculation yielded mean recurrence periods of ca. 100\u202fyears, though this figure is biased by a relatively high degree of uncertainty in the dating and in the age-depth model. Even with this caveat, the present study reveals the underexplored potential of periglacial eolian deposits to preserve paleoseismological signals.\n               ","62":"\n                  We focus here on the different forcings that controlled the deep-marine sediment dynamics and associated stratigraphic pattern in the Nankai subduction zone, especially in the Kumano forearc basin. In this study, based on high-resolution subbottom profiler data, we investigate the Upper Pleistocene\u2013Holocene deposits of the tectonically active Kumano forearc basin to better understand the role of glacio-eustatic forcing and tectonic-morphological controls on the sedimentation patterns in the basin. We recognize three distinct seismic units that characterize the different stages of the last to current interglaciation cycle. Chaotic debris- and mud-flow deposits, intercalated with turbidites accumulating mainly in the deep basin, are related to a lowstand stage when rivers were directly connected to canyon heads. The transgressive stage, covering the deglaciation period, is characterized by a high proportion of turbidites and a decrease in chaotic deposits. The flooding and development of the Ise Bay at ~10\u202fka, resulted in starvation of the deep basin where mostly hemipelagic deposits occur. However, some dilute flows still reached the proximal area of the basin depositing some turbidites. We identify an interplay between the global sea-level rise and the shelf morphology, both having a strong control on the deep-marine stratigraphic pattern of the Kumano Basin. The rise of sea level triggered a disconnection between the river mouth and canyon head, thus inducing a general retrogradation of sediment-gravity flow deposits throughout the deglaciation. The shelf morphology, which is mainly driven by tectonic uplift (narrow shelf) or subsidence (wide shelf), directly played on the connection between the river and deep-marine system and on the accommodation space in the shallow-marine environment. Although it does not appear as a dominant control, climatic control, especially the influence of the East Asian summer monsoon during deglaciation cannot be neglected. It most likely contributed to an increase in sandy sediment supply occurring at the beginning of the transgressive stage.\n                  The highlight of our study is related to the tectonically-controlled shelf morphology and its role on the deep-marine stratigraphic pattern. The northwestern area of the Kumano Basin, undergoing significant tectonic-related uplift, is defined by a narrow shelf (<10\u202fkm) and sustained sediment supply to the basin throughout the deglaciation and highstand period. However, under similar eustatic and climatic conditions, the eastern area characterized by the development of the subsiding Ise bay (wide shelf\u202f>\u202f90\u202fkm), shows a decrease in sand supply to the basin toward the end of the deglaciation. A strong control of the shelf morphology on the deep-marine stratigraphic pattern is also observed in other forearc basins along the Nankai subduction zone undergoing similar eustatic and climatic conditions.\n               ","63":"\n                  Healed speleothems, sparsely mentioned in literature, have been noted in one of the side passages of the Dem\u00e4nov\u00e1 Cave System in Slovakia. Speleothem healing commonly proceeds in columns and flowstones after their brittle deformation. Crystallization of calcium carbonate in fractures and along their mouths results in formation of various outgrowths: subvertical ridges, subhorizontal ridges, and helictites. Morphology of the subvertical ridges and helictites indicates that they were supplied by water migrating through the fractures, while the subhorizontal ridges resulted from gravity-controlled water flow down the speleothem surface. Stable isotope composition of the outgrowths suggests that they crystallized as a result of CO2 degassing, like most speleothems. Since speleothem damages in the DCS are directly linked to fault reactivation, the healed speleothems appear to be advantageous objects for seismotectonic analysis of karst terrains.\n               ","64":"\n                  The Latrobe Group in the Gippsland Basin consists of well-developed, stacked shoreface and coastal plain deposits, cut by large, incised channel systems up to 500\u202fm deep. These large channels are conspicuous on seismic intersections and have previously been interpreted as the result of fluvial incision associated with basin inversion\/compressional tectonics. Here we have used 3D seismic, well log, and core to re-evaluate the origin of these channel systems. We interpret three major phases of channel incision-infilling; Tuna Channel 1, Tuna Channel 2 and the Marlin Channel. Biostratigraphic data shows that the channels range in age from the Palaeocene-Eocene transition to the Late Eocene. These ages indicate channel formation occurred prior to the onset of compressional tectonics in the Gippsland Basin, which began at the Eocene-Oligocene transition.\n                  Correlation of these channels with coeval palaeoshoreface systems reveals that the channels are located seaward of, and in close proximity to these shorelines. Well data indicates that the channel fill sediments are of marine origin, consisting of glauconite, dinoflagellates, foraminifera, and marine macro fossils. We do not observe evidence for a regional unconformity which would correlate with over 500\u202fm of subaerial channel incision. These channels are therefore interpreted as submarine canyons, rather than channels of fluvial origin. They are interpreted as shelf-incising, with canyon heads located close to coeval palaeoshorelines where they received sediment via longshore\/littoral processes. The erroneous identification of submarine canyons as incised valleys in sedimentary basins has significant implications for tectonic and eustatic histories globally.\n               ","65":"\n                  The mid-Albian to lower Cenomanian Utrillas Group is interpreted as an arid braidplain system in the Serran\u00eda de Cuenca region (Iberian Basin, Spain). In its proximal locations, it consists of an interaction of alluvial facies and subordinate aeolian deposits, with the occurrence of tidally-influenced deposits that reflect a general transgressive trend to the top of the succession. However, the distal areas of this braidplain system, where there was a more intense interaction with the Tethys Ocean, have remained understudied to date.\n                  We present a sedimentological study of two outcrops (Pajaroncillo and Re\u00edllo) located at the distal sector of the braidplain system and 12\u202fkm apart, defining an along-strike relative position. Both outcrops differ notably regarding the arrangement and distribution of the facies associations identified despite their relative closeness. Based on the sedimentological analysis, the main transgressive and regressive trends of the succession have been identified, along with several correlatable stratigraphic surfaces. This has permitted us to distinguish five stages (T1\u2013T5), which reflect the overall transgressive evolution of the succession: a continental aggradational stage (T1), dominated by alluvial deposition; an initial transgression stage (T2) dominated by an open coast setting in Re\u00edllo and a restricted mudflat system in Pajaroncillo; a regressive stage (T3), during which continental alluvial to supratidal environments deposited; a resumption in transgression (T4), characterised by an array of inter- to subtidal environments; and a deepening stage (T5), when the transgression advanced landward, giving rise to the most distal deposits of the studied succession.\n                  The studied outcrops, located at the basin edge, have been integrated within the regional sequence stratigraphy framework, which was originally devised for more central areas of the Iberian Basin (Valencia Domain) and the Prebetic. This regional approach has allowed us to interpret the studied deposits as third-order depositional sequences. Besides, the supra-regional implications of this research are discussed within the broader context of Iberia and the subtleties of its tectono-sedimentary evolution during the Albian to Cenomanian times.\n               ","66":"\n                  Tectonics, climate, and lithology are the three main factors controlling the generation and transfer of sediments as well as their textural and compositional signatures. In this paper, we investigate the generation of sands from volcanic rocks in nine drainages with mixed lithological assemblage in a high-relief \u2013 subtropical climate setting (Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, NE Colombia). The integration of geomorphological analysis with sand petrography, and bulk-rock and clay geochemistry allows us to constrain the dynamics regulating the generation of sediments derived from felsic and mafic-intermediate volcanic basement rocks in relation to plutonic and metamorphic lithologies. The petrographic composition of modern fluvial sands from the area is extremely variable (litho-feldspatho-quartzose, feldspatho-quartzose, and quartzose-feldspatho-lithic), but it reveals a strong dilution of (especially mafic) volcanic compositional signals, and a consequent overrepresentation of plutonic and metamorphic lithologies. Traditional chemical weathering indices fail to represent the extent of chemical alteration, but instead seem to favour preservation of provenance signals. Chemical weathering primarily affects feldspars and the ferromagnesian groundmass of mafic volcanic rock fragments. Enrichment of ferromagnesian elements in the clay fraction supports the notion that mafic volcanic rock fragments are unstable relative to plutonic and metamorphic rocks. Drainage features (particularly river network and relief) control the abundance of volcanic lithic fragments and the rates and extent of chemical weathering. A linear log-ratio model permits us to quantify sediment generation from volcanic rocks in this mixed-lithology setting. The results indicate that even in the case where volcanic grains are practically absent in the sand fraction, there could still be up to 20% of volcanic rocks in the drainage basin, and in the case that 50% of the sand grains are volcanic, around 75% of drained lithologies are expected to be volcanic. Our results demonstrate that the contribution of volcanic detritus to modern sands systematically underrepresents the areal proportion of volcanics rocks in mixed source areas. Post-depositional diagenetic modifications are likely to alter and\/or dissolve volcanic lithic fragments, making accurate reconstruction of sediment provenance even more difficult. Sediment-generation models based on a range of mixed lithologies in various tectonic and climatic settings will be needed to improve estimates of the abundance of volcanic rocks in drainage basins of ancient sediment routing systems.\n               ","67":"\n                  The Central Asian orogenic belt is an accretionary orogenic belt that lies between the Siberian block and the Tarim and North China blocks. Since the central south of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt has been covered by desert and the Meso-Cenozoic Bayingobi Basin, its spatial configuration, evolution, closure time, and the Paleo-Asian ocean location have not been well described. Through zircon UPb dating, in-situ Hf isotope and rock geochemistry of the Lower Cretaceous Bayingobi Formation sandstones, the provenance of the Bayingobi Formation, and the central south boundary of the Central Asian orogenic belt were determined, the tectonic evolution process was discussed, and the tectonic evolution models were established. The provenance of the Bayingobi Formation mainly originated from Permian to Early Triassic granodiorite, diorite and potassium feldspar granite that cover a large area of the Zongnaishan-Shalazhashan tectonic belt. In the early Permian, this tectonic belt was mainly a continental island arc but gradually transitioned to a continental active margin, accompanied by intense tectonic magmatic activity. With the boundary as the Quagan Qulu ophiolite belt, the north is the Central Asian Orogenic Belt that mainly exhibits juvenile crustal materials, while the south is the Alxa block, which has an affinity with the North China block, and mainly exhibits older crustal materials. From the late Carboniferous to the early Permian, the Paleo-Asian Ocean plate was compressed, subducted along the Enger Us suture, and magmatic distributed along the Nuru-Langshan tectonic belt; from the late early Permian to late Permian, the Paleo-Asian Ocean plate rolled back, changing the subduction zone stress state from compression to extension. During this period, there were large-scale developments of magmatic rocks in the Zongnaishan-Shalazhashan tectonic belt. From early Early Triassic to Middle Triassic period, the Siberian active margin collided with the Alxa block, the Paleo-Asian Ocean was closed, and the overlying Alxa plate experienced lithospheric extension and thinning, accompanied by asthenospheric upwelling, partial melting and the addition of new crustal material. The Meso-Cenozoic basin sediments along the original suture belt are characterized by an enrichment of large ion lithosphere elements, a loss of high field strength elements, LREE enrichment and loss of HREE.\n               ","68":"\n                  Microbialites span a substantial fraction of Earth history, and have important meanings for understanding long-term history of life and environment. Key controls on microbialite morphology and distribution include substrate topography, hydrodynamic conditions, water depth, salinity, light intensity, and sedimentation rates. This leads to potentially complex combinations of control by internal spatial feedbacks and also external factors. This complexity is explored here using Stromatobyte3D, a new numerical stratigraphic forward model that calculates microbialite accumulation due to in-situ precipitation, sediment trapping and binding, and sedimentation from suspension, controlled by evolving topography and water flow due to waves, tides or other currents. Results show that with increasingly strong spatial interactions of microbialite growth with water and suspended sediment, particularly the influence of hydrodynamics on in-situ microbialite growth and suspended sediment deposition patterns, three distinct microbialite morphologies are produced, from isolated columns, through elongated mounds, to ridges elongated in the dominant flow direction. Quantitative analysis demonstrates a dominant antecedent substrate topographic control on microbialite nucleation and growth in the absence of water flow, declining as hydrodynamic processes and strong spatial interactions are introduced causing mounds to accrete and coalesce laterally in the flow direction. Formation of coherent morphological patterns, produced by spatial interactions between topography, hydrodynamics, microbialite growth, and sedimentation from suspension, and independent of initial condition, is evidence of spatial self-organization. Modelled morphologies are strikingly similar to observations from modern marine agglutinated microbialite strata, suggesting modelled processes and their behaviours are realistic, and can therefore be useful to assist field interpretations of observed microbialite morphologies where similar processes were operating together.\n               ","69":"\n                  Glendonite is generally accepted as a calcite pseudomorph after ikaite (CaCO3\u00b76H2O) and is commonly preserved in spherical carbonate concretions known as glendonite concretions in marine sedimentary rocks. Although they have widely attracted attention as environmental indicators, the detailed geochemical process underlying glendonite formation is not fully understood. Here to show the glendonite concretion formation process, we conducted detailed macro- and microscopic observations, carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses (\u03b413C and \u03b418O), chemical composition analyses, and elemental mapping of glendonite concretions from four Cenozoic marine sedimentary strata in Japan. The occurrence of glendonite and concretions around dead organisms such as bivalves, ghost shrimp, or soft-bodied organisms forming ichnofossils, and the negative \u03b413C values of glendonite concretions around \u221220\u2030 to \u221210\u2030 showed that organic matter in dead organisms served as a carbon source for both ikaite crystals and the surrounding concretions. Highly concentrated phosphorus and its distribution patterns in glendonite concretions showed that changes of phosphate concentration in porewater play a crucial role in the sequential formation process from ikaite crystallization to syngenetically surrounding calcite concretion growth. The sequential processes of glendonite concretion formation progressed rapidly owing to the supply of bicarbonate during the decomposition of organisms in marine sediments. Our work provides a phosphate concentration-controlled growth model of glendonite concretion involving organic decomposition that can be used to evaluate paleoporewater chemical conditions during early diagenesis.\n               ","70":"\n                  The Cenomanian\/Turonian period is characterized by the deposition of organic-rich and fine-grained sediments that form important source rocks and unconventional reservoir units in North Africa and other parts of the world. The Lower Turonian deposits of the Djebel Darmoun Field, southeast Constantine Basin, Algeria, comprise a thick carbonate succession that has potential as an unconventional reservoir unit. This research aims to investigate the Lower Turonian succession in terms of microfacies, diagenesis, petrophysical, and geochemical characteristics, which were previously unknown. Sedimentological and diagenesis analyses were performed based on the core and thin section observations. Furthermore, geochemical and petrophysical analysis methods were carried out to assess the resource potential based on geochemical measurements, core measurements, and well logging evaluation in an arrangement. Based on sedimentological investigation, the Lower Turonian carbonate section is composed of tight limestone and dolostone rocks characterized by four bioclastic limestones and two dolomicrite microfacies, while paleontological investigation indicates that the faunal content is dominated by planktonic assemblages, revealing a pelagic deep marine setting environment. The primary pores of the Lower Turonian carbonate rocks are seldom preserved due to multi-stage diagenetic alteration (i.e., cementation, compaction, fracturing, dolomitization, dissolution, asphaltene), while dominant secondary pores are represented by dissolution-enlarged and open fractures\/fissures, while intercrystal pores might be added in dolostone intervals. Dissolution and fracturing diagenetic events play a major role in enhancing the pore network, while compaction, cementation, and asphaltene diagenesis processes share in the obliteration of the petrophysical properties. Dolomitization played a dual role in the dolostone intervals, where it tended to develop the porosity at the early stages of diagenesis, while it tended to decrease the porosity at the latest diagenesis stages. The geochemical analysis indicated high amounts of organic matter in these intervals, where the higher estimated organic richness reaches a maximum TOC of 7.8% at the lowermost part. The petrophysical analysis inferred that the Lower Turonian carbonate sediments are characterized by low porosity (avg. 4%), very low permeability (<0.01mD), with dominant micro and meso porosities, and therefore they can be classified as tight carbonate unconventional resources. This study provides an insight into factors controlling the pore system network (microporosity) of fine-grained carbonate rocks as an excellent analog of the deep marine unconventional tight limestone and dolostone reservoirs and improves the knowledge and modeling of these unconventional resources. The study sheds light on the organic-rich sediments that are associated with oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) across the North African region and other parts elsewhere, forming high quality source rocks that might be neglected as excellent unconventional resources.\n               ","71":"\n                  Isolated sharp-based sedimentary bodies in shelf settings can develop via the reworking of regressive deposits during transgressions. An example of these are shelf ridges, formed under a wide range of processes, and widely studied due to their high reservoir potential. However, there is still a lack of examples in mixed (carbonate\u2013siliciclastic) successions. This study presents an outcrop example from the Upper Miocene of the Betic Cordillera (Spain), with the aim to propose a model for the development of transgressive sharp-based mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic deposits, and to provide criteria to differentiate these from their regressive counterparts. The studied succession is ca. 300\u202fm-thick, and shows a cyclic alternation of coarse and fine-grained mixed deposits. Depositional cycles start with siliciclastic-dominated offshore to offshore transition deposits, progressively replaced by lower shoreface deposits. These are abruptly truncated by sharp erosive contacts bioturbated by passively-infilled large burrows; their ichnological features allow assignation to the Glossifungites ichnofacies. These contacts are interpreted as ravinement surfaces. They are overlain by mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic barforms, rich in skeletal fragments and extraclasts, and displaying large-scale cross bedding. These form several m-thick and hundreds of m-long depositional elements interpreted as mixed shelf ridges. These ridges formed in a fine-grained, shallow-water shelf, which occasionally received coarse siliciclastic sediment supply via gravity flows, but had a coeval offshore carbonate factory, which provided the skeletal fragments. The sharp-based, coarser-grained nature and lithological break at the base of these mixed carbonate\u2013clastic deposits could lead to their misinterpretation as forced-regressive wedges. However, the nature of their lower contact, combined with the reworked offshore skeletal fragments, and their stacking pattern are consistent with these mixed units forming during transgression. Other studies in relatively time-equivalent deposits have demonstrated the existence of coeval regressive, coarser siliciclastic-dominated shoreline systems in relatively close localities. These evidence a complex basin configuration in the area during the upper Miocene, with the development of local depocentres and relatively narrow corridors or seaways in the Mediterranean\u2013Atlantic connection, which could have favoured shelf reworking processes, but also promoted the development of diverse stacking patterns, reflecting the differential interaction between active tectonics and sedimentation across the region.\n               ","72":"\n                  Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is a relatively new type of analysis that has been used to obtain a better understanding of the temperature and salinity of the water that mediated the development of dolostones in the Cenozoic successions of isolated oceanic islands. There is, however, still some uncertainty about the factors that could modify the clumped isotopes even in shallow burial conditions and thereby affect the temperatures and salinities derived from them. Here, focus is placed on a 210.5\u202fm thick succession of Miocene dolostones that is found on the Xisha islands in the South China Sea that have experienced rapid subsidence since the Early Miocene. These dolostones are typically formed of crystals that have a \u201cdirty\u201d core that is encased by a clear outer rim. The formation of the \u201cdirty cores\u201d, the primary replacement dolomite, was probably mediated by normal seawater in near-surface conditions, whereas the later cements formed at higher temperatures from slightly evaporated seawater. Given that it is impossible to separate the \u201cdirty cores\u201d from the clear rimes for analytical purposes, it must be recognized that the clumped isotopes and other geochemical data (e.g., \u03b418O, 87Sr\/86Sr) are averages of these two types of dolomite. This also means that the development of dolomite in these dolostones involved two successive stages of dolomite development that was probably related to sea-level cycles. Despite these issues, clumped isotope thermometry can still provide valuable temperature and salinity information for understanding the dolomitization processes that led to the development of island dolostones.\n               ","73":"","74":"\n                  Environmental scenarios around the Cenomanian-Turonian ocean anoxic event (OAE2) interval are scarcely studied in the southeastern Neo-Tethys and not discussed in terms of variation of primary mineralogies of marine carbonates. Based on petrological and geochemical analyses, this study focuses on the increased aragonite abundance in the oxygen-decreasing interval before the OAE2 and its environmental implications in the southeastern Neo-Tethys. In central Iraq, the upper Cenomanian-lower Turonian Mishrif Formation represents marine carbonate records in the southeastern, tropical Neo-Tethys and includes five members from the lowermost Mi-5 to the uppermost Mi-1. From Mi-5 to Mi-1, dominant carbonate components and primary carbonate mineralogies vary. Mi-5 is dominated by primarily calcitic grains (mainly calcite shells of rudists and echinoids); Mi-4 and Mi-3 dominated by primarily aragonitic grains (mainly green algae and aragonitic bivalves) and planktonic calcitic foraminifera; and Mi-1 dominated by primarily calcitic ooids. Paleoenvironmental interpretations suggest: i) open marine, offshore settings for Mi-5 to Mi-3, and a shallow marine shoal setting for Mi-1; ii) a sea level rise from Mi-5 to Mi-3, followed by a sea level fall to Mi-1. The increasing aragonite abundance in Mi-4 and Mi-3 is exceptional and suggested to most likely reflect enhanced preservation of shallow-marine aragonite transported into open marine offshore settings. This enhanced aragonite preservation is likely related to an oxygen-decreasing level before the OAE2 in the offshore settings. Remarkably, these primarily aragonitic components are commonly preserved now as moldic pores in Mi-4 and Mi-3. The moldic pores are interpreted to be produced via deep burial dissolution of recrystallized aragonitic grains, based on petrological and geochemical analyses. Moreover, the primary carbonate compositional and mineralogical changes from Mi-5 to Mi-1 provide some potential clues for the environmental scenarios around the OAE2 interval in the southeastern, tropical Neo-Tethys: i) from Mi-5 to Mi-4 and Mi-3, the increasing abundance of primarily aragonitic components is accompanied by a sea level rise, increasing seawater temperature and decreasing oxygen level of bottom water; ii) from Mi-3 to Mi-1, the decreasing abundance of primarily aragonitic components is accompanied by a sea level fall, decreasing seawater temperature and enhanced microbial carbonate production.\n               ","75":"\n                  Two forebulge successions exist in the Oman Mountains at the platform-foreland basin transition between the Late Albian to Turonian Natih Formation and the foreland basin shales of the Late Cretaceous Muti Formation. Forebulge creation is suggested by limestone microfacies analyses and analyses of ferruginous crusts and oolites, showing rapid changes in bathymetry and relative sedimentation rate. Each succession displays basal shallow subtidal limestone, passing upward directly to ferruginous crusts and then to Fe-rich oolites deposited in shallower and agitated water. Each succession is topped by clayey layers. Microfacies and lithological evolution of the two successions are alike, suggesting repetitively similar depositional and tectonic conditions. As both sequences occur at the same site, lateral forebulge migration possibly did not occur, suggesting an overall stationary vertical and stepwise forebulge development. The compositional evolution of the ferruginous crusts was complex and includes postdepositional diagenetic effects of the rocks. Both ferruginous crusts once consisted of iron sulfides, implying at least slightly reducing conditions during their formation, associated with water-deepening events. Both oolite levels contain chlorite, hematite, quartz, calcite and apatite. They also contain fragments of chlorite and hematite as nuclei, suggesting that these fragments derived from preexisting ferruginous crusts. Iron oxyhydroxides and clinochlore within the oolites reflects bathymetric changes to more oxidizing aqueous conditions, associated with water-shallowing events. Fe-rich anoxic to sub-oxic sea water of the marine foreland basin was the source for the crusts and oolites which coincided with a high rate of global Cretaceous ocean crust production and related hydrothermalism as well as the regional proximity of an active spreading axis. Fe was probably stabilized in ocean water as organic Fe complexes and Fe colloids.\n               ","76":"\n                  Chalks are generally believed to have formed in shallow marine environments. However, the consensus on sources of Fe and origin of hematite in red chalks remains elusive. To better understand the origin of hematite in the Middle Cretaceous red chalks on the eastern coast of England, the evidence has been gathered through diffuse reflection, trace element and iron isotope analysis and combining with the lithologic and stratigraphic characteristics. Rare earth element (REE) patterns exhibit upper-continental-crust-like signatures such as enrichment in light REEs and depletion in heavy REEs. The Fe isotopic composition of the red chalk is typically heavier than that of igneous rocks (except for one sample) and shows negative Eu anomalies (Eu\/Eu*\u202f=\u202f0.58\u20130.73), which indicates that the hematite in the red chalk is not of microbial or hydrothermal, but of sedimentary origin. At the same time, the analysis of trace elements suggests that the felsic rocks and sedimentary derivatives are the source of non-carbonate components in the red chalks. The pedogenic features such as mudcracks, secondary white chalks, and calcareous nodules appear in the red chalks, as documented through the field stratigraphic observations. Based on the above evidence and the sedimentary environment of the overlying and underlying layers, it is inferred that the red chalk was deposited in the supratidal environment that had undergone some degree of desiccation and pedogenic modification.\n               ","77":"\n                  Reservoir non-destructive patchy barite cement occurs in volumes up to 16 vol% in deeply (>5150\u202fm) buried shoreface sandstones in the Hejre field, Danish Central Graben, North Sea. Barite typically occurs as an accessory cement in the sandstones of the Upper Jurassic Heno Formation; however in the Hejre field, barite appears more abundant in the crestal-most well than in other wells. The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics and the origin of patchy barite cement besides implications for reservoir properties. Petrographic investigations by optical and scanning electron microscopy supplemented by isotopic analysis by SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy) were applied to reveal the barite cementation process. Porosity and permeability of the sandstones were measured by conventional core analysis. Barite cement occurs in the Hejre field with three morphologies: crystals arranged in rosettes, crystal fillings of bioclasts, and multiple-oriented intergrown small crystals in veins. SIMS showed similar sulphur and oxygen isotopic compositions for these barite morphologies, and this composition resembles evaporite-derived barite cement. A hydrothermal origin of the fluid is supported by the associated precipitation of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena, and a high Sr\/Ba ratio in barite. Conventional core analysis revealed major reductions in porosity and permeability when barite cement occurs as fracture filling or in combination with calcite cement in shell lags. However, these occurrences are rare and have a minor influence on the overall reservoir properties. Minor reduction of porosity and permeability characterizes sandstones with barite cement in rosettes of radiating crystals. This growth pattern was probably promoted by slow seep of sulphate-rich fluids which, by mixing with barium-bearing formation water became super-saturated with respect to barite as they moved towards lower temperature and pressure zones. Faults acted as pathways for transport of sulphate-rich fluids possibly from evaporite deposits, whereas barium may have originated from compactional fluids leached out of underlying volcaniclastic rocks. Thermochemical sulphate reduction led to precipitation of sulphide minerals, minor sulphur fractionation and fluid acidification, whereby calcareous bioclasts dissolved. Barite precipitated when the fluids entered these large- or over-sized pores with small obstacles causing prolonged fluid-rock interaction. The bioclast-replacing and patchy barite cement caused only limited reduction of reservoir porosity and permeability compared with barite-free sandstones from the Heno Formation found at a similar burial depth.\n               ","78":"\n                  Porosity formed after compaction has been recognised for many years in carbonate rocks, but there is little consensus as to the origin of the fluids responsible for dissolution, and the processes by which pores are generated. In particular, it is often hard to identify the source of fluids that are below calcite saturation, and in sufficient volumes, to explain the apparent volume of porosity. This study directly addresses this challenge through analysis of core data from a number of oil fields across north Oman, which produce from the lower Cretaceous (Aptian) Shuaiba Formation. The Shuaiba Formation in all these fields exhibits high total porosity, comprising pores that range in size from less than a micron to centimetres in diameter. There is an increase in the effective porosity upwards within the succession; permeability is highest in the upper 15\u202fm of the formation, beneath the top-Shuaiba unconformity. Since this unconformity represents a hiatus of over 5\u202fmillion\u202fyears (My), caused by platform emergence, previous studies often interpreted porosity modification to be due to dissolution by groundwater during penecontemporaneous exposure of the platform. Nevertheless, paragenetic relationships indicate that most of the secondary porosity that was formed early in the burial history was either occluded by drusy calcite cements, or destroyed by compaction. Furthermore, many of the drusy calcite cements are etched, indicating that dissolution took place after cementation. Consistent with this, many of the pores formed on the margins of tectonic fractures and stylolites, indicating that some pore-formation post-dates compaction.\n                  The top of the Shuaiba Formation in all fields is between 600 and 1600\u202fm, following uplift in the late Cretaceous and early Oligocene by inversion along deep-seated, strike-slip faults. Possible causes of dissolution are cooling of upward-rising brines fluxed along faults and corrosion by organic acids prior to hydrocarbon emplacement. It is unclear, however, as to the extent to which these fluids could dissolve carbonate before reaching equilibrium. A third possible fluid is groundwater. Sulphur isotope data from paragenetically late pyrite, is consistent with bacterial sulphate reduction, indicative of relatively cool temperatures (<60-80\u202f\u00b0C). Porosity enhancement might, therefore, have been facilitated by mixing of groundwater with highly saline reservoir fluids, resulting in undersaturation with respect to calcium carbonate. Overall, the data reveal a complex history of porosity modification, which relates to rock fabric, stratal architecture and tectonic history and suggests multiple controls on post-compactional porosity modification. Most significantly, the data strongly suggest that dissolution occurred during orogenic uplift and telogenesis, providing a new explanation for how porosity formation can occur after lithification, along stylolites and fractures, from a volumetrically significant source of carbonate-undersaturated fluid.\n               ","79":"\n                  Knowledge of desert landscape evolution and related aeolian deposits will increase our understanding of the earth system. Desertification and dust cycle in the middle latitudes are an important part of global change and an important window to understand the earth's climate system. The Hexi Corridor is one of the dust storm centers in northern China and Asia, but the reason of desertification process and its relationship with local aeolian landforms and deposits are still unclear. Based on the extensive survey of aeolian landforms and the analysis of elemental, depositional, and structural properties of diverse aeolian sediments (dune sands, Gobi silts and dust loess), this study explored the genetic connection between dune sands in the study area, gobi erosible silts in the upwind area and dust storms in the downwind area and their relationship with desertification in the Hexi Corridor. The analytical results suggest that the dune sands in the Hexi Corridor are weakly related to the gobi sediments in the upwind area and the dust loess in the downwind area from the perspective of genetic connection, but there is a close relationship between gobi and dust sediments. On the decadal scale, the change trend of dust storm events in the study area is consistent with the variational process of the regional-scale desertification, indicating that the dust storm is an effective indicator of desertification process in the study area on a large scale. Based on the genetic connection and differences between the dust storm, gobi topsoil and dune sand and combined with other environmental parameters, we identified two different processes of desertification in the Hexi Corridor. One is an abnormal, reverse desertification process that occurred on a regional scale, which is inconsistent with the change of global climate and global dust storms. The other is an increased desertification process that occurred in the oasis area on a local scale, which has no relationship to global and regional climate change but is closely related to the decline of groundwater level in the oasis area. This provides good evidence for us to understand the causes of different landsurface processes that occurred in a unified environment in middle latitudes.\n               ","80":"\n                  Sediment cores are a major source of sub-surface data for a variety of environmental research endeavors, as well as mining and civil engineering applications. In paleo-environmental studies, fluctuations in mineral abundances along sediment cores are used to study climate change, sea-level variations, sediment dynamics, and landscape evolution. Increasing reliance on such proxies spurs the need for reliable and time-saving analytical tools and procedures. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is a rapid, non-destructive and accurate tool for quantification of mineral abundances. We use DRIFTS to calibrate Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) hyperspectral images (HSIs) of a sediment core, in order to convert point-specific DRIFTS measurement of mineral abundances into a continuous record of mineral abundances along the core. Initially, single-phase and mineral assemblages of quartz, calcite, and clay mineral are created and measured by DRIFTS to establish calibration curves to convert DRIFTS data into mineral abundances, as %wt of bulk sediment samples. Mineral abundances are then measured by DRIFTS in a set of 60 samples from a core drilled into the Albegna River delta, Tuscany, Italy in the Fall of 2020. SWIR-HSIs of the core are then obtained and averaged over the areas corresponding to the samples taken for point-specific DRIFTS measurements. Least squares regressions are established between SWIR-HSI and DRIFTS data over these areas. This calibration is then used to convert SWIR-HSIs of the entire core into a continuous prediction of quartz, calcite, and clay mineral abundances along the core. The continuous record highlights sharp changes in mineral composition, smeared out in the discontinuous DRIFTS record. The advantages and limitations of the method, as well as its applicability to other sedimentary environments are discussed.\n               ","81":"\n                  On the passive margin of southern Brazil, where the availability of sediments and coastal system conditions were adequate for forming a Ti\u2013Zr-bearing placer in the Holocene, could there be a source of detrital contribution other than the Precambrian South American cratons? To answer that, detrital zircon U\u2013Pb\u2013Hf analyses were performed using the LA-ICP-MS method. The U\u2013Pb age pattern distribution of 866 zircon grains showed that 35.3% of the grains belong to the Neoproterozoic, which covers the Brasiliano orogenic belts. However, 9.1% of the total zircons analyzed (up to 12% in some samples) correspond to grains younger than 50\u202fMa, restricted to the Andean orogeny in southern South America. The Hf signature of the zircons stands out by pointing to five significant and distinct groups interpreted as coming from the Andean (0\u201350\u202fMa), Gondwanides (230\u2013380\u202fMa), Famatinian (380\u2013500\u202fMa), Brasiliano (850\u2013541\u202fMa), and Grenville (900\u20131300\u202fMa) orogens, confirming an Andean fingerprint as source rocks in addition to the sediments originating from the craton. This Andean source is related to the distal sediment contribution from the La Plata River system and Argentina rivers that discharge in the Atlantic Coast. Based on a statistical and Hf isotope approach, we defined that around 50% of the zircons grains were transported from the Argentina coast and La Plata River by the littoral drift for more than 1000\u202fkm to their final sink in the southern Brazilian coast.\n               ","82":"\n                  An integrated approach of facies analysis, architectural element analysis and geochemistry provides significant insight into the palaeogeography, palaeoclimate and provenances of alluvial sediments in the Neoproterozoic Badami intracratonic rift basin, India. Process-based facies analysis identified twelve facies, grouped into five facies associations that record a palaeoenvironmental setting ranging from screecone \u2013 alluvial fan to braided fluvial. Rockfall and debris flow dominate the depositional processes in the screecone \u2013 proximal fan settings, whereas streamlet, sieve and sheetflood processes characterize the middle to distal fan palaeogeography. Furthermore, a distal braided fluvial system developed with decreasing depositional slope. Streams within the distal fan had ephemeral flow whereas the braided fluvial setting had semi-perennial to perennial flow. The braided fluvial basin expanded temporally; channels become shallower and wider in response to base profile rise and ultimately drowned under the sea. The poorly sorted clastic deposits of the studied interval are interpreted as a lowstand product. The water table primarily controls spatial variability in flow duration within channels. Nevertheless, temporal water table rise due to a change in climate resulted in persistent flow duration within the fluvial system. The screecone - alluvial fan setting developed on both margins of the east-west trending basin following northerly and southerly palaeoslope respectively. However, associated braided fluvial deposits indicate a westerly dipping palaeoslope, inferred from palaeocurrent directions, which corroborate an intracratonic rift setting. Major and trace element geochemistry and molar A-CN-K plots, CIA and palaeoweathering trends of sandy sediments traced \u2018transitional\/uplifted continental\u2019, mixed provenances in the north, south and eastern parts of the basin ranging in age from Archaean to Mesoproterozoic. The rifting is inferred to be related to Rodinia supercontinent breakup.\n               ","83":"\n                  Early Carboniferous (Mississippian) strata across the Laurentian cratonic interior record the transition from a stable carbonate platform, supporting a broad epicontinental sea, to a series of widespread, mixed carbonate-siliciclastic successions. As the southern terminal sink, the Mississippian succession preserved on the southern Midcontinent provides evidence and constraints for sediment dispersal patterns. This paper presents the first comprehensive U\u2013Pb detrital-zircon geochronological record of all known Mississippian sandstones from the southern Ozark Dome of southern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas. This study identifies the provenance of these Mississippian sandstones and establishes their sediment dispersal networks across the cratonic interior. Results show that a major provenance shift occurred between Lower and Upper Mississippian strata. The Lower Mississippian Bachelor Sandstone was sourced from the Laurentian craton, while Upper Mississippian and basal Pennsylvanian sandstones were sourced through recycling of upper Proterozoic and lower Paleozoic sandstones within the Laurentian craton to the north, the unroofing of the Appalachian orogenic belt from the east-northeast, and potentially some direct contribution from uplifted Precambrian basement along the Transcontinental Arch to the northwest. By combining previously published detrital zircon data from Laurentia, we propose that the Mississippian sedimentation reflects an intertwining dispersal system associated with multiple sources. Sediments derived from all three potential sources were merged and transported southward across Laurentia.\n               ","84":"\n                  Sedimentary facies, geometry, and stacking pattern transitions of river-mouth sediment bodies recording the turnaround from a transgressive estuary to a regressive delta system have not been sufficiently clarified in the Asian sedimentary record. In this study, the temporal and spatial distributions of sedimentary facies of the post-Last Glacial Maximum incised-valley fills (pLGMIVFs), including those recording delta initiation in the Tama River Lowland, on the west coast of Tokyo Bay, are described taking into account 14 sediment cores, 186 radiocarbon dates, and 8745 geotechnical borehole logs. The pLGMIVFs in the Tama River Lowland, which unconformably overlie Plio-Pleistocene deposits, can be divided into braided-river, meandering-river, estuary, and delta systems in an ascending order. The boundaries between the braided-\/meandering-river or estuary systems and the estuary\/delta systems correspond to a transgressive surface (20\u202fka) and a maximum flooding surface (8\u202fka), respectively. In the estuary system, the river-mouth sediment body, accumulated during 10\u20138\u202fka, gradually became smaller and coarser-grained landward; in contrast, the delta system's river-mouth sediment body became larger, finer-grained as it prograded seaward during the past 8 ky. With decelerating sea-level rise at 8\u202fka, the delta initiated as a sediment body, consisting of 5-m-thick, upward-coarsening sand and gravel beds, distributed in an area of 2\u202fkm wide and 2\u202fkm long in a funnel-shaped river mouth. This initial delta prograded locally in the subaqueous river mouth, with the saltmarsh spreading widely landward at the margins of the delta to the highest sea-level peak at 7\u202fka. This separation of subaqueous delta progradation and inland saltmarsh expansion occurred because the volume of sediment deposition was almost equal to the increase in accommodation space due to the 7\u202fmm\/yr sea-level rise during 8\u20137\u202fka.\n               ","85":"\n                  This paper focuses on celestite-carbonate-cemented veins that developed in the Jialingjiang Formation of the Lower Triassic carbonates from the Libixia anticline in eastern Sichuan Basin, China. Comparative petrography and geochemistry of the host rock and vein minerals provide clues to the nature, origin, and evolution of the vein-cementing fluids. The host rocks are composed mainly of micrite dolomite which yields \u03b418O, \u03b413C and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios close to the values that characterize contemporaneous seawater. Two generations of vein-mineralization were recognized based on textural relationships, fluid inclusion data and isotope geochemistry. The early generation is dominated by celestite and saddle dolomite, formed from hypersaline, Sr-enriched, hydrothermal fluids. The later generation is represented by calcites, precipitated from less saline fluids at lower temperatures. The 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of vein dolomite and celestite vary from 0.7076 to 0.7081, significantly lower than those of host carbonate counterparts (0.7078 to 0.7081; average 0.7080). This isotopic discrepancy suggests that the majority of Sr was sourced from deeper sequences of the lower Triassic carbonates, probably associated with thermochemical sulfate reduction for Sr accumulation. It is argued that the fracture systems associated with the Huayingshan fault provided the heat source and served as conduits for migration of hydrothermal fluids through several hundred meters, and the final mineralization occurred as a result of mixture of Sr-enriched brines with sulfate-bearing solutions. The large celestite ore bodies in the studied area are proposed to form related partially to these hydrothermal fluids.\n               ","86":"\n                  The sedimentological, lithological and textural characteristics of the Brown Tuffs (BT) pyroclastic deposits, combined with their grain-size, componentry and geochemical glass compositions, are here investigated to obtain information on the transport and depositional mechanisms of the corresponding pyroclastic density currents (PDCs). The BT are widespread reddish-brown to grey, ash-rich pyroclastic deposits generated by pulsating hydromagmatic explosive activity from the La Fossa Caldera on Vulcano island during the c. 80\u20136\u202fka time-stratigraphic interval, and then distributed on most of the Aeolian Islands and Capo Milazzo peninsula (Sicily) and in the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Sea regions. Near the source area on Vulcano, the BT are characterised by alternating massive and planar to cross stratified lithofacies that result from the stepwise, repeating aggradation of discrete PDC pulses. This alternance is regulated by either fluid escape or granular flow depositional regimes at high clast concentration or grain by grain traction deposition in the waning diluted stages of the PDCs. Most of the BT on Vulcano show intermittently stratified and massive ash deposits resulting from a pervasive post-depositional disruption of the primary structures. This is induced by upward fluid expulsion associated with dissipation of pore pressure between layers at different grain size (fine to coarse ash) and porosity, as outlined by distinctive upwards bends and pillar-type escape structures through the fluid-filled cracks and rupture points. Massive BT deposits with a faint colour and grain-size banding are widely recognised on Lipari, the nearby island of Vulcano. Based on the presence, at the base of BT depositional units, of cm-thick amalgamation bands containing pumice lapilli, scoria and lithic clasts ripped-up and embedded from the loose underlying pyroclastic units, they are interpreted as deposited by ash-rich PDCs laterally spreading from La Fossa Caldera and moving to Lipari. During their motion to Lipari these currents (likely) crossed a narrow and shallow sea-water inlet which did not stop their advancement but influenced the grain size distribution of those spreading on the Lipari mainland. In this paper, the mechanism of clast erosion and incorporation is outlined across the whole island of Lipari by means of field study, grain-size, and geochemical glass analyses on the different components of the mixed basal bands of the BT. This suggests that the BT PDCs maintained enough flow power as to erode the substratum, hence likely impacting the territory, over a distance up to at least 16\u201317\u202fkm from the volcanic source. Evidence that the BT PDCs exerted a high shear-stress over the loose substratum is also provided by undulated, recumbent flame and rip-up structures at the base of some depositional units in southern and central Lipari. In order to form such bed granular instabilities between the BT and the underlying deposits we calculate that the currents had at least a shear velocity of ca. 2\u202fm\u202fs\u22121 and a shear stress in the range of 1\u20104.5\u202fkPa. These results add new insights on the large-scale hazard at the Aeolian Islands and shed new lights on the widespread transport and depositional dynamics of ash flows spreading over the sea and reaching nearby islands, and their interactions with the substratum and the pre-depositional topography.\n               ","87":"","88":"\n                  A section of the northern Yanjia nearshore subaqueous fan sandy conglomerate was investigated to understand high-quality reservoirs' distribution and controlling factors in the retrogradation and progradation sequences. These conglomerates have been demonstrated to have strong heterogeneity, tightly cemented, and feature low porosity and permeability. To provide an inclusive understanding of the formation mechanisms and factors governing the distribution of the high-quality reservoirs, we utilized integrated methods including seismic, cores description, wireline, petrography, scanning electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence, and mercury intrusion capillarity. The results showed that the retrogradation rock types are dominated by arkose and lithic arkose and the progradation by lithic arkose and feldspathic litharenite. The dominant diagenesis events are compaction, carbonate cementation, and dissolution. The mechanical compaction effect is similar in the progradation and retrogradation sequence. The average compaction index of 0.70 and 0.68 for the transgressive system tract and highstand system tract, respectively, revealed that compaction is the dominant mechanism in reducing reservoir quality in the nearshore subaqueous fan.\n                  The carbonate cementation is more extensive in the highstand system tract than the transgressive system tract. The braided channel sandy conglomerate from transgressive system tract and highstand system tract have the best reservoir quality and features type I and II mercury intrusion capillarity cures with large pore throat and good physical properties. However, the braided channel reservoir quality from the highstand system tract developed during the progradation phase is relatively better than the braided channel of the transgressive system tract in the retrogradation phase. These microfacies are characterized by a substantial dissolution of rock fragments and feldspar. The main channel and the interchannel deposited during the transgressive and highstand system tract, respectively, represented by type III mercury intrusion capillarity curves with small pore throats, are non-reservoirs. The formation mechanism of the high-quality reservoirs in the highstand system tract is guided by sedimentary facies, compaction resistant ability, dissolution of rock fragment, and feldspar. The genetic mechanism of the high quality in the transgressive system tract is governed by the sedimentary facies, compaction resistant ability, carbonate and feldspar dissolution. This study revealed that the progradation sequence retained the favorable high-quality in the nearshore subaqueous fan. This study proved that, for adequate assessment of reservoirs in the Yanjia area and similar reservoirs elsewhere, reservoir characterization must link sequence stratigraphy, sedimentary facies, and diagenesis to comprehend the high-quality reservoir distribution to help the predrill evaluation of reservoirs.\n               ","89":"\n                  Tufas are freshwater carbonate deposits that attracted attention as paleoclimatic archives and analogs of microbial carbonates. Recent geomicrobiological studies revealed that cyanobacterial photosynthesis significantly contributed to the precipitation of CaCO3 (photosynthesis-induced CaCO3 precipitation; PICP), and that the chemical properties of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by cyanobacteria significantly influenced on the depositional fabrics. These depositional processes were revealed from tufas formed in cool and temperate climates; however, their applicability to tufa deposits in other climate conditions remains unclear. This study, therefore, investigated tufa deposits that formed in a tropical climate in Brazil and applied geomicrobiological techniques, including microelectrode measurements and lectin-binding analysis, to clarify their depositional processes. The surfaces of eight investigated tufa samples were dominated by cyanobacteria. Microelectrode measurements indicated the occurrence of PICP in all the samples. However, five samples additionally exhibited a Ca2+ concentration decrease at the tufa surface, even in dark conditions, which was difficult to explain by abiotic CaCO3 precipitation and light-independent microbial metabolisms. Based on the fluxes calculated from the results of microelectrode measurements, the contribution of PICP to the formation of CaCO3 precipitates was estimated as 100% for three samples, similar to tufa deposits in cool and temperate climates. For the remaining five deposits, the average contributions of PICP, Ca2+ adsorption to organic matter, and other processes were estimated as 36%, 3%, and 61%, respectively. Among the phototrophs living the tufa surface, Phormidium and Leptolyngbya secreted EPS abundantly containing carboxyl groups, and were heavily calcified. In contrast, Phormidesmis, Calothrix, Pleurocapsa, and diatoms secreted EPS without detectable amount of carboxyl groups, and they were largely not calcified and formed pore spaces. Such influence of microbial EPS on the depositional fabrics were common to cool and temperate tufas. Nonetheless, some features would be specific to tropical tufas, including the contribution of unidentified light-independent processes, conical and columnar surface morphologies, and unclear annual lamination.\n               ","90":"\n                  The evaporites of the Aptian Lo\u00e9m\u00e9 Formation occur along the stable structural domain of onshore Congo as horizontally well-stratified depositional halite interbedded with Mg-poor potash minerals including carnallite, bischofite, tachyhydrite and sylvite. Eleven correlative depositional recharge-to-evaporation cycles are composed of suites of organic-prone shale followed by primary halite and carnallite beds, sometimes punctuated by a bischofite-tachyhydrite end-member.\n                  A sedimentological and petrographical analysis performed on cores and thin sections allowed an interpretation of nine facies associations, named as FA1 to FA9, relying upon the occurrence of bands of fluid inclusions, grain-size, dissolution features, detrital sediments, minute inclusions and sedimentary structures. A depositional model reconciles the spatial distribution of primary textures, hydrology, brine saturation and palaeo-depth during a standard regressive evaporation cycle. Shallow burial eo-diagenesis led to compaction-driven dissolution and recrystallization into fine-grained halite and carnallite laminites but poorly affected the overall preservation of primary deposits.\n                  Measurements and profile analysis of bromine trace element concentrations reveal a palaeo-salinity increase of the parent brine for cycle II to base IX caused by a relative brine level fall and a gradual confinement of the salt basin, likely associated with an excess of saline elements inflow from hydrothermal vents. Similar depositional textures and bromine concentration variations are observed in the lower cycles of the Aptian evaporites from the counter-part Sergipe Basin in the northern part of the Brazilian margin, testifying of a progressive brine salinity rise due to a palaeogeographic confinement along the northern segment of the South Atlantic Ocean.\n                  In Congo, the sylvite displays horizontal \u201cpseudo-stratifications\u201d that unconformably overlay the crests of anticlines and propagate along flanks as a sharp-based caprock. The flushing and transformation of depositional carnallite \u2013 halite into secondary sylvite \u2013 halite is interpreted as having been caused by down-stepping incremental dissolutions sourced by younger pervasive connate to phreatic waters. In Sergipe, the sylvite is interpreted as secondary but further results from syndepositional dissolution of carnallite and tachyhydrite due to a regional North Atlantic Ocean ingression.\n               ","91":"\n                  The Asmari reservoir properties in various hydrocarbon fields across the Dezful Embayment (SW Iran) are modified by dolomitization. Petrographic and geochemical analyses of the dolomitized Asmari Formation units highlight their origin in the Bibi Hakimeh and Gachsaran oilfields. The petrographic studies revealed that dolomite in the Asmari Formation can be classified texturally (based on crystal sizes) into three main groups: (i) very fine crystalline (D1, <20\u202f\u03bcm), (ii) fine to medium crystalline (D2, 20\u2013150\u202f\u03bcm) and (iii) coarse crystalline dolomites (D3, >150\u202f\u03bcm). Petrography, fluid inclusions, stable isotopes (\u03b413C, \u03b418O), radiogenic isotopes (86Sr\/88Sr) and major and trace elemental analyses were used to interpret the origin and paragenetic sequence of each dolomite group. Pervasive dolomitization prevails in the upper part of the Asmari Formation where very fine and medium crystalline dolomites with partially and fully fabric-retentive and fabric destructive textures, replaced micrite and allochems of the platform-top facies, respectively. The parent fluids of the very fine dolomites originated from contemporaneous Oligo-Miocene seawaters produced in a sabkha environment. The fine to medium dolomites (D2) most likely shared the same seawater origin and relate to refluxing, sabkha-derived fluids. The medium to coarse crystalline dolomite has more depleted oxygen isotopes than the former, very fine to fine crystalline, dolomites suggesting a burial dolomitization origin. The estimated high salinities (\u224819 to 20\u202fwt% NaCl) together with compatibility of oxygen and strontium isotope data with evaporative seawater values, suggest Oligo-Miocene seawater was the parent fluid for precipitation of coarse and cement phase of the medium crystalline dolomites. This study reveals that reactivated basement faults with associated fractures have probably played an important role in convecting and heating evaporative seawater along their planes. This heated seawater provided the required fluid for recrystallization of coarser matrix and cement phases of medium (D2) and coarse (D3) dolomites at depth. Therefore, the interaction of climate, sea-level changes, and tectonics played a critical role in formation and development of pervasive dolomitization in the Asmari Formation. Additionally, dissolution (partly as a consequence of dolomitization) was one of the key processes during early diagenesis in the formation of different types of porosity such as biomolds, vugs and intraparticles porosity. This study shows that the reservoir quality improves from finely crystalline dolomite towards samples dominated by coarsely crystalline dolomites.\n               ","92":"\n                  Iron oxide\/oxyhydroxide precipitation in nature can involve various mechanisms that are associated with environmental conditions.

These precipitates, dominated by ferrihydrite nanogranules (20\u201330\u202fnm), acicular goethite nanorods and nanofibers (>200\u202fnm), and various twinned goethite polymorphs (~1\u20133\u202fmm), record a series of crystallization stages that reflect the mechanisms of iron mineralization. For Fe oxyhydroxide formation this involved: (1) biogenic ferrihydrite and goethite nanoparticle formation, (2) ferrihydrite\u2013goethite transformation and development of nanogranule-attached goethite, (3) goethite twin development, and (4) multi-generation overgrowths on twined goethite. This process shows that the Fe was fixed biogenically with crystallization taking place via a nonclassical nanogranule-aggregation pathway. As such, it highlights the complex mechanisms of crystal growth and morphological development involved with Fe oxyhydroxide mineralization in nature. The distribution of the precipitates, concentrated in larger voids ~11\u202fm below ground surface, demonstrates their sensitivity to ambient conditions such as redox and Fe supply.\n               ","93":"\n                  Worldwide phosphogenesis during the early Cambrian occurred coevally with localized Rare Earth Element plus Y (REY)-rich phosphorite in Zhijin, South China.

To address this, the research studied the REY occurrence forms and enrichment mechanisms. Accordingly, carbonate C and O isotopes, micropetrographic, and in situ geochemical analyses of Zhijin phosphorites were conducted. Results show that the phosphates are composed of closely-packed nano to \u03bcm-scale apatites, which were spherulitic and short cylindrical, comprising mainly fluorapatites and minor francolites.

Apatites show Medium REE (MREE)-rich post-Archean Australian shale-normalized distribution patterns, attributed to selective adsorption of MREEs by Fe-\/Mn oxides\/hydroxides or organic matters. Plots of Nd and Ceanom manifest lower sedimentation rates of REY, providing adequate time for REY absorption in the seawater. Excluding secular variations of REEs in the ocean chemistry, we suggest that constrained paleogeography provided a suitable space for REEs entering apatite crystals during early diagenesis. This is possibly the primary cause for the vast REE reserves of the Zhijin phosphorite deposit. In addition, redox conditions, temperature, biological activities, and weathering played non-critical roles in REY enrichment in apatites. Our findings can inform on multi-factor constraints of REY-rich marine phosphorites in the early Cambrian and provide a further understanding of REY enrichment in worldwide sedimentary marine phosphorites.\n               ","94":"\n                  The study documents soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDSs) in the lacustrine Dongying Depression, a Paleogene synrift basin located in the southeastern corner of the Bohai Bay Basin, East China. The focus of this study is the lower part of the upper 4th member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation (Es4U), characterized by littoral to sublittoral deposits in the southwestern Dongying Depression. Nine lithofacies are grouped into the upper shoreface facies associations (FA1-1), lower shoreface facies associations (FA1-2), and sublittoral facies associations (FA2). Fine-grained calcareous sandstone was mainly deposited in FA1-1, with thinly alternating calcareous mudstone and siltstone or sandstone in FA1-2, while deposition in FA2 was dominated by mudstone, containing sediment gravity flow deposits. The SSDSs widely encountered in the lower Es4U can be classified into seven categories: (1) load structures, (2) water-escape structures, (3) folds and convolute lamination, (4) sediment-injection structures, (5) microfaults, (6) autoclastic breccias, and (7) slumps. Detailed observations of SSDSs from cores indicate liquefaction and fluidization as the main deformation mechanisms in the sands and muds. Moreover, rupturing of cohesive deposits also contributes to the soft-sediment deformation. The types and morphologies of the SSDSs are closely related to the rheologies of the sediments (e.g., the sand content), influenced by the facies that determine the lithologies and stratigraphic stacking patterns. Except for some deformation structures related to subaqueous sediment gravity flows (e.g., muddy debrite flows and slumps), most SSDSs are ascribed to rift-related seismicity due to the activity of the adjacent synsedimentary faults when the Dongying Depression underwent quick subsidence during the Eocene.\n               ","95":"\n                  Point bars are common in the fluvio-tidal transition of rivers, yet detailed characterization of their sedimentology and neoichnology is rarely reported. Herein, we present sedimentological and ichnological descriptions for a seaward translating point bar located in the fluvio-tidal transition of the Serpentine River, BC, Canada. This bar accumulates in mainly polyhaline water, and channel flow is tide-dominated. The landward bar has steep channel banks and grain size fines from medium sand in the thalweg to mud in the upper intertidal zone. The seaward side of the bar forms a bench-like morphology that is steeply inclined in the intertidal zone, has a wide, gently dipping platform in the lower intertidal\/uppermost subtidal zone, and a steep lower subtidal channel bank. Sediment sizes fine from coarse- to medium-grained sand in the thalweg, to mud in the lower intertidal zone. Medium-grained sand is deposited on the middle- and upper-intertidal zone of the seaward-side of the bar as a result of flow reversal and impingement of the flood tidal current against the seaward side of the translating point bar.\n                  The neoichnological assemblage of the intertidal part of the translating point bar is characteristic of brackish-water environments, and comprises low diversities of diminutive structures that occur locally in high densities (Bioturbation Indices 3\u20134). The neoichnological distribution correlates closely with the macrobenthos distribution, which in turn indicates marine-nutrient distribution. Marine nutrient supply is likely controlled by the bar's morphology. Biogenic structures attributable to Arenicolites, Skolithos, Polykladichnus and Siphonichnus mark the middle and upper intertidal zones, as well as the lower intertidal zone along the landward side of the bar. The trace makers that produce this trace assemblage are resilient to prolonged subaerial exposure and employ diverse feeding strategies. The lower intertidal zone along the seaward side of the bar is affected by decreasing current velocities across the wide bench-like morphology, which permits regular deposition of marine nutrients. Here, population counts are high and trace makers specialize in surface deposit- and filter-feeding. Traces include Gyrolithes-like structures and Siphonichnus. The Gyrolithes and Gyrolithes-like burrows that are produced by S. kowalevskii at the study site are hypothesized to potentially reflect the trace maker's anatomical predisposition, and not represent some spatial or anchoring advantage.\n                  This work represents the first published study on the neoichnology of a tide-dominated, translating point bar in the fluvio-tidal transition.

Dendritic blind tidal channels drain the inshore tidal flats and saltmarshes in the distal part of the fluvial-tidal transition zone (FTZ) of the macrotidal Sittaung River estuary, Myanmar. The present study details the sedimentology and stratigraphic architecture of point bars of the blind tidal channels to evaluate the relative importance of tidal and seasonal river processes in the distal part of the FTZ. The point bars consist of silty tidal rhythmites that display hierarchical tidal cycles manifested in the layer thicknesses. The rhythmites formed during the dry season are slightly muddier and more thinly laminated with accentuated neap-spring tidal cycles, whereas those formed during the wet season exhibit anomalously thick layers with indistinct tidal cycles and abundant subcritical climbing ripples. The wet-season rhythmites are commonly associated with bank-normal, high-relief truncation surfaces presumably formed by heavy rainfall at low tides during river floods. Chevron-like upbuilding of the tidal rhythmites overlies the surfaces in the upper part of tidal point bars, attesting to the rapid removal of accommodation space by sedimentation during the river floods with sustained high sediment loads. A time series of digital elevation models exhibited a rapid infill of the blind tidal channels, suggesting high sediment supply onto the tidal flats throughout the year. Despite being located in the seaward end of the FTZ of the estuary, where tidal amplification occurs, the blind tidal channels evolve in response to seasonal river floods as well as tidal currents, accounting for the dynamic geomorphic changes of the inshore tidal flats and saltmarshes in the Sittaung River estuary.\n               ","97":"\n                  Aeolian desert systems were widely distributed in South China during the Late Cretaceous. These systems developed under the control of subtropical highs and a monsoon climate. They reveal the evolution of palaeoclimate and palaeogeography and the regional palaeowind pattern in the South China interior during this period. Based on the analyses of sedimentology and facies architecture, this study examines and reassesses the aeolian succession of the Upper Cretaceous Daijiaping Formation in the southern Liyou Basin of southeast China. This aeolian desert succession records aeolian dune, dry and damp interdune and aeolian sandsheet sedimentation in streamflow, fluvial channel and overbank settings. Aeolian dune deposits comprise low-angle dune plinth strata and superimposed sets of cross-strata bounded by a hierarchy of bounding surfaces. The deposits record two morphological types of compound crescentic dunes and complex linear dunes. Palaeowind direction in the Liyou desert agrees with the subtropical high-pressure westerly and northeasterly wind pattern that existed in the mid to low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, in conjunction with possible monsoon climate conditions during the Late Cretaceous. The fault-bounded basin in which the succession accumulated experienced a high subsidence rate and a high supply and availability of windblown sand, which ensured hundreds of metres of thick accumulation of the dune field system. The occurrence of a near-surface water table and soft-sediment deformation in the aeolian dune foresets indicates that the monsoon rains could have recharged the groundwater system and resulted in episodes of relative water-table rise, which played an important role in the accumulation and preservation of aeolian systems in the Liyou desert basin. Gradual and progressive subsidence of the aeolian succession combined with water-table fluctuations allowed the preservation of the aeolian accumulation system.\n               ","98":"\n                  Studies on the environmental dynamics of high energy beach systems have to deal with factors as diverse as wave energy, coastal currents and tidal amplitude. Their interaction produces complex and often poorly understood sedimentary architectures. As a rule, the results achieved do not allow us to understand the depositional architectures associated with each of these processes. In this article, we analyze a high-energy beach system describing geometries, textures, paleocurrents, ichnological associations and taphonomic aspects seeking to define the associated environmental parameters. Detailed analyses of sedimentary facies, and analyses of paleocurrents, ichnological and taphonomic associations were performed in a high resolution sequence stratigraphy. The integrated analyses demonstrate the evolution of a high-energy beach system with a general north-south direction in a meso- to macrotidal regime, built by waves from the northwest, generating longshore currents to the south. A subordinate pattern, with waves coming from the southeast, generating longshore currents to the north, was also interpreted. Due to the high wave energy, evidence of tide action is sporadic, but the wide dominance of upper shoreface deposits with low angle dips, indicating an extension in the continent-offshore section, are compatible with a meso- to macrotidal setting. Taphonomic analysis shows that skeletons of marine invertebrates and vertebrates were significantly reworked and redistributed by strong wave action and longshore currents marking high energy events related to scour surfaces. Changes in the pattern of ichnofauna and bioturbation intensity are associated with variations in environmental energy and probably in salinity. The ichnological data helps to indicate progressive environmental stress towards the Cretaceous\/Paleogene (K\/Pg) boundary. Paleocurrent data, measured in trough cross-bedding of the upper shoreface deposits, suggest a complex atmospheric circulation pattern and water circulation of an inland sea. The resultant climatic pattern is compatible with modern atmospheric circulation at a similar latitude. The excellent exposure and abundant fossil records at K-Pg interval make this region an important source for studies of environmental dynamics and their interaction with biota at middle-high latitudes.\n               ","99":"\n                  The role of microbial vs. abiotic processes in ooid formation has been a controversial topic for over a century. Recent sedimentological, geochemical and biomarker data indicate that microbes make an important contribution to the construction, destruction and modification of ooids. Here, we present a detailed petrographic and chemical investigation of well-preserved red oolites from the Lower\u2013Middle Jurassic Nieniexiongla Formation in the Tethyan Himalaya of southern Tibet. Petrographic studies and electron probe microanalysis indicate that the red coloration is due to the presence of hematite minerals. The hematites show euhedral and amorphous spheroidal morphology and residual elemental sulfur was detected within minerals. The \u03b434S values in the leachate (\u03b434SNaCl) and in carbonate associated sulfate (\u03b434SCAS) of red oolites are lower than gray oolites and micritic limestones. Moreover, \u03b434SNaCl and \u03b434SCAS values are lowest in samples with the highest content of hematitic ooids. Together, these observations suggest that the hematites are transformed from pyrite. The Fe2+ (and possibly SO4\n                     2\u2212) provided by pore-water combined with degradation of syn-depositional organic matter within ooids produced anoxic microenvironments that facilitated local pyrite precipitation. Some spheroidal pyrites were subsequently transformed to euhedral crystals through continuous growth of the constituent microcrystals. This study demonstrates that organomineralization mediated by sulfate-reducing bacteria can produce pyrite grains within carbonate ooids. The results emphasize the important role that microbial communities play in the deposition and modifications of ooids.\n               ","100":"\n                  Steep-fronted Gilbert-type deltas are common features of tectonically active settings, as well as of physiographic settings where accommodation is dictated by landforms with steeply inclined margins, such as incised valleys, fjords, and proglacial lakes. Existing facies models for Gilbert-type deltas are largely qualitative; this study presents a quantitative analysis of the variability in facies architectures of such deltas. A database approach is used to characterize the preserved sedimentary architecture of 62 Gilbert-type deltas of Cretaceous to Holocene ages developed in various basin settings worldwide. Data on 706 architectural elements and 12,872 facies units are used to develop quantitative facies models that describe the variability in architecture and facies of Gilbert-type deltas at multiple scales of observation, and to account for the possible controls exerted by allogenic and autogenic factors.\n                  The analysed data reveal high variability in the geometry and facies of Gilbert-type deltas. The thickness of the examined deltas varies from 2 to 650\u202fm, yet positive scaling between delta thickness and length is consistently recognized across the studied examples, which is interpreted in terms of relationships between accommodation, sediment supply and delta lifespan. Based on their facies character, the deltas are classified into gravel- and sand-dominated types, with contrasting facies organizations of topset, forest and bottomset elements, and by different relationships between facies and dimensions; yet, both types exhibit significant spatial variability in the distribution of sediments linked to debris flows or turbidity currents, and in vertical stratal trends. Changes in allogenic (e.g., changes in base-level or, rate of sediment influx) and autogenic mechanisms (e.g., channel avulsion) are inferred as causes for significant differences in facies organization, both across distinct deltas and within individual deltaic edifices.\n                  The study highlights the marked variety of architectural and sedimentological (e.g., grain size, depositional processes) properties of Gilbert-type deltas. Findings allow the relation of outcrop observations to a general template and the quantitative determination of potential analogues with which to assist the prediction of the dimensions and facies of deltaic sedimentary bodies in the subsurface.

This unit is composed by a succession of limestones, shales, sandstones, and coquinas, which constitute shell beds near the top. This last interval strongly suggests a marine influence in the whole basin based on the fossil assemblage. However, even though the establishment of marine waters during the deposition of the Romualdo Formation is a consensus, paleogeographical and paleoenvironmental aspects still need to be better understood. This study aims to perform a sedimentological analysis of the coquina interval, based on petrographic and taphonomic analysis of field data and in a new fully recovered well-core (2-AB-1-CE) drilled in the Serra do M\u00e3ozinha at Abaiara county in the Cear\u00e1 State. The described rocks were subdivided into eight facies constituted by bivalves, gastropods, ostracods, peloids, micrite, siliciclastic grains, punctual foraminifers, and plant debris. Based on facies' vertical stacking at well 2-AB-1-CE, a main regressive pattern was observed. It was also possible to subdivide the coquina interval into high-frequency transgressive\u2013regressive cycles. The regional distribution of the facies permitted the identification of a shallow epeiric sea throughout the basin, with variations in the paleoenvironment energy and siliciclastic input. These variations were mainly controlled by paleotopography, fluvial discharge, and sea-level oscillations. The data allowed the identification of two subsequent paleogeographical configurations controlled by sea-level change. The first one, related to a sea-level high, was characterized by a protected bay on the western border and a gulf in the rest of the basin. Then a sea-level fall led to the formation of closed and open lagoons associated with higher terrigenous supply. As such, this study adds new data for a better understanding of the Araripe Basin and the impacts of sea-level fluctuations in South America during the Aptian.\n               ","102":"\n                  The Hecla Hoek succession of northeastern Svalbard, Norway, is an ~7\u00a0km thick Tonian\u2013Ordovician sedimentary succession that overlies Stenian\u2013Tonian felsic igneous and metasedimentary rocks. The carbonate-dominated upper Tonian\u2013Ediacaran (ca. 820\u2013600\u00a0Ma) Akademikerbreen and Polarisbreen groups have yielded important insights into Earth's Neoproterozoic climate, environment, and biological evolution. However, the underlying siliciclastic-dominated lower Tonian (ca. 950\u2013820\u00a0Ma) Veteranen Group has garnered little attention despite the fact that it is remarkably well-preserved and hosts diverse microfossil assemblages. Here, we present the first detailed sedimentological analysis of the Veteranen Group from a continuous ~4.4\u00a0km thick stratigraphic section at Faksev\u00e5gen, Ny Friesland, Spitsbergen. Integrated facies analysis, sequence stratigraphy, and carbonate \u03b413Ccarb and \u03b418Ocarb chemostratigraphy elucidate the early depositional history of the Hecla Hoek basin and provide fundamental paleoenvironmental constraints for future investigations of this succession as an archive of Tonian Earth History. The Veteranen Group records a long-lived deltaic and storm-influenced marine sedimentary system that reveals dynamics of Precambrian clastic sedimentation prior to the evolution of land plants. Five asymmetric transgressive-regressive (T-R) sequences within the Veteranen Group thin upwards, providing support for the hypothesis that the contact with the Akademikerbreen Group represents a rift-to-drift transition. This complex record of Tonian deltaic and storm-influenced marine sedimentation along the Laurentian margin strengthens correlation between the Veteranen Group and coeval strata from East Greenland and sets the stage to better understand the Proterozoic tectonic evolution of the North Atlantic\u2013circum-Arctic region following the Grenville orogeny.\n               ","103":"\n                  Fan deltas grow largely through repeated cycles of lobe construction and channel erosion during the period of channelized flow. Although previous studies suggest that variable flood discharge may play a key role in strong erosion and related fully confined main channel formation in fan deltas, analog experiments with constant discharge and sediment supply showed that strong erosional events were cyclic. Understanding erosion cycles is important for land management and flood hazard mitigation. Here, we present flume experiments to investigate the mechanism and controlling factors of fully confined main channel-related erosion under constant discharge conditions. The results reveal that: (1) fully confined main channel-related erosion is triggered by turbulence within stratified fluid in hydraulic jump process. When the topography difference of the fan delta is sufficiently small, the flow direction changed from steeper flanks to the centerline. The flow velocity along centerline increase due to weak viscosity and steep slope of fan delta, changing the subcritical flow to supercritical flow. Supercritical flow transports sediment to the shoreline and is resisted by the standing body of water in the basin, causing the decrease of flow velocity accompanied by hydraulic jump. The turbulence formed in hydraulic jump process triggers the formation of scour hole which erodes the fan delta. (2) Input conditions control the range of the critical slope and frequency of erosion cycles. The critical slope is inversely related to the slope of the discharge and grain size of sediments, whereas it is directly related to the sediment\/water ratio. The frequency of erosion cycles is directly related to the slope of substrate layer, discharge and sediment\/water ratio. (3) The fan delta evolves under the interaction between the deposition process and topography. Moreover, dynamic equilibrium of experiments including main channel-related erosions and autogenic slope adjustments can be found in natural fan deltas.\n               ","104":"\n                  Although fossil fluvial travertines have been described, factors controlling their formation are poorly understood because of the paucity of their modern counterparts. To disclose processes affecting their deposition, a modern fluvial travertine system at Bagni San Filippo (Siena, central Italy) was studied here and compared with other cases. The studied travertines occur in a valley with an ephemeral stream, but continuous water influx from hot springs on the hillside makes part of the stream become perennial. Four sub-environments were recognized: slopes, waterfalls, pools, and channels. The first two are mainly composed of laminated crystalline crust-boundstone. In contrast, pools are mainly covered by lime mud and some post-flood travertine-encrusted breccia, while channels commonly display abundant travertine-encrusted breccia. Many erosional features and products were also found and are largely the result of episodic erosion triggered by heavy rainfalls and accompanied floods. The predominant erosional processes might include abrasion and plucking. Based on environment distribution, stream bed morphology, and erosional distinctions, the fluvial system was distinguished into slope-pool-waterfall and channel-pool-waterfall subsystems. Such system differentiation is attributed to the original stream bed difference: wide beds promoted the development of slopes, while narrow beds encouraged travertine erosion and subsequent gravel accumulation during flood events, favoring the formation of channels. The comparison shows that fluvial travertine deposition largely occurs within existing rivers. The relative contribution of spring water to original river water controls the deposit composition (the higher contribution ratios, the more abundant carbonate\/travertine facies). Furthermore, erosion might be common and unavoidable because the reported fluvial travertines were all formed in non-arid regions. These findings suggest that fluvial travertine deposition is influenced by topography, hot spring contribution, original river bed geometry, and fluvial erosion, and might aid in the interpretation of ancient fluvial travertine systems. Additionally, downstream fluvial travertine systems might show similar characteristics to fluvial tufas, but their formation is clearly hot spring influenced, indicating the importance of analyzing facies distribution and \u03b413C-\u03b418O signatures in fluvial carbonate studies.\n               ","105":"\n                  The primarily carbonate Gabbs Formation of west-central Nevada, U.S.A., remains an important, rare example of Panthalassan shallow-marine environments from the Late Triassic and through the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary. Its relevance as a locality persists, particularly as the end-Triassic mass extinction interval is increasingly recognized as a carbonate crisis, evidenced by the global decline of carbonate facies and calcareous marine organisms. However, important transitions across key stratigraphic boundaries in this region have tended to be evaluated in isolation, producing an incomplete picture of sedimentation through the duration of the Late Triassic leading up to the geochemical crises and mass extinction at the close of the Triassic. In this work, multiple correlative measured sections are used to describe the facies in the mixed carbonate-siliciclastic ramp and characterize controls on carbonate facies. The outer ramp transition to inner ramp facies of the Gabbs represent a transgressive\u2013regressive\u2013transgressive cycle culminating in a transition to terrigenous inputs and a gradual decline of carbonate sediments stratigraphically below the mass extinction interval. This predictable loss of carbonate facies and the near continuous deposition of the Gabbs Formation allow for evidence of facies changes and acidifying conditions in the latest Triassic to be considered independently, in contrast to other global Late Triassic sections where depositional hiatuses or abrupt facies changes often compound these records. Establishing a baseline sedimentation for the Late Triassic demonstrates that the final loss of carbonate facies can be decoupled from the onset of acidifying conditions, resulting in a more precise timeline of latest Triassic environmental upheaval.\n               ","106":"","107":"\n                  Trace elements in cave carbonates (both calcite and aragonite) have been considered major proxies in paleo-hydroclimatic research. However, their imprints in authigenic minerals might be altered by neomorphic processes (e.g., aragonite-to-calcite transformation). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the impacts of neomorphism on the trace element compositions of secondary calcite and understand the mechanisms of trace elements redistribution during neomorphic processes. In this study, two aragonite stalagmites (SN3 and SN15) from Shennong Cave, part of which were transformed into calcite, were further inspected and analyzed in terms of petrological observations, trace element geochemistry, and Mg compositional mapping. The results show that (1) the aragonite-to-calcite transformation in SN3 and SN15 occurs by a dissolution-precipitation mechanism and is influenced by several factors, including internal fluid compositions, microstructure (such as porosity and permeability) of the parent material, and crystal defects. (2) The primary aragonite is enriched in Sr but depleted in Mg compared with secondary calcite because of the crystallographic disparity. The non-equilibrium absorption of Mg and slow diffusive element transport may contribute to the extremely high Mg\/Ca ratios in secondary calcite near the mineral phase boundary. Incorporation competition among trace elements also plays an important role in affecting the distribution of Sr and Mg in neomorphic calcite. Considering the previous study on the alteration of isotopes (\u03b418O, \u03b413C) associated with the aragonite-to-calcite transformation, we propose that intervening fluids play an important role in altering the secondary calcite oxygen isotopic composition and Mg\/Ca ratio, while the composition of primary aragonite dictates the secondary calcite carbon isotopic composition and Sr\/Ca ratio, provided that the transformation of aragonite to calcite caused by a dissolution\u2013reprecipitation process occurring in trapped pore water.

To investigate this, a Mesoproterozoic aeolian succession, the Galho do Miguel Formation (SE Brazil), was studied using facies and architectural-element analyses. The sedimentary succession comprises deposits of simple dunes, draas (megadunes), and dry and wet interdunes. Dry and wet aeolian sub-environments were coeval and their development was likely controlled by local topographic relief that governed a hybrid dry-wet aeolian system. The dry sub-environment was composed of interconnected interdune corridors between large and well-developed bedforms (simple dunes and draas). The water table did not influence the construction of climbing dunes and dry interdunes, but this was fundamental for long-term aeolian accumulation. Due to the proximity of the water table to the depositional surface, the dry interdune flats were eroded only up to the groundwater level, where the wetness inhibited sand removal during dune migration. This condition enabled the accumulation of thick packages of dry interdune deposits (up to 3\u202fm thick). The wet sub-environment is represented by extensive interdune flats, non-climbing dunes, and a continuously near-surface water table. In this context, the interdune deposits underwent only minimal reworking associated with dune migration. This setting allowed the progressive rise of the interdune substrate and the amalgamation of interdune deposits of different generations, thereby producing thick wet-interdune stratal packages (up to 8\u202fm thick). The accumulation of thick packages of interdune strata in both sub-environments was generated by: (i) high rates of vertical accumulation of the interdune substrate due to high rates of sediment input for aeolian construction in Precambrian systems, and (ii) progressive relative rise of the water table. These conditions enabled the long-term accumulation and successive preservation of Precambrian aeolian systems, in which the stabilising effects of vegetation did not operate. Therefore, the aeolian architecture of the Galho do Miguel Formation suggests that: (i) Precambrian aeolian systems probably produced thicker dry and wet interdune deposits than their Phanerozoic counterparts, and (ii) hybrid dry-wet aeolian systems likely provided the most favourable conditions for long-term accumulation and successive preservation of these types of deposit in the Proterozoic.\n               ","109":"\n                  During the Messinian salinity crisis (5.97\u20135.33\u202fMa) the Mediterranean was transformed into the youngest salt giant in Earth history. In marginal Mediterranean subbasins, the first stage of the crisis is recorded by up to 16 lithological cycles made up of shale\/gypsum couplets (Primary Lower Gypsum unit, PLG), making a downslope transition to organic-rich shales. Gypsum comprises a wide array of lithofacies, including bottom-grown gypsum, cumulate deposits (i.e., resulting from gypsum nucleation in the water column and subsequent deposition on the seafloor) and the branching selenite. The latter appeared synchronously in many sections of the Mediterranean in the 6th PLG cycle (i.e., at about 5.87\u202fMa). To investigate the still enigmatic stratigraphic architecture of the lateral lithofacies transition from the shallower basin margin to the depocenter and the paleoenvironmental modifications driving the development of the branching selenite lithofacies, we carried out sedimentological, petrographic and geochemical analyses of the different types of gypsum lithofacies exposed along a margin-to-depocenter transect in the Piedmont Basin (NW Italy), corresponding to the northernmost Mediterranean subbasin. The results of this study suggest that the lateral and vertical distribution of gypsum lithofacies mostly reflects the position of an oxycline with respect to the seafloor. Bottom grown gypsum (cycles PLG1\u2013PLG5) was deposited on a temporarily oxygenated seafloor above the oxycline in the marginal part of the basin. In the case of cumulate deposits (laminar gypsum and gypsiferous mudstones, cycles PLG6\u2013PLG15), gypsum nucleated within the water column at the oxycline and was eventually deposited on an anoxic seafloor. The branching selenite lithofacies corresponds to a syngenetic product formed below the seafloor at the expenses of cumulate gypsum. Deposition of cumulate gypsum and formation of the branching selenite were controlled by the balance between the rate of sulfate reduction in bottom waters and nucleation of gypsum in the water column. The appearance of cumulate gypsum and the branching selenite from the 6th PLG cycle upwards reflects the intensification of water column stratification in response to increased isolation of the basin.\n               ","110":"\n                  In addition to the continental slope and basin floor, gravity flow deposition on the shelf is increasingly attracting attention. In order to explore the environmental conditions and sedimentary rules of large-scale gravity flow deposition in shelf sea, paleogeomorphology restoration and identification, distribution and evolution of sediment gravity flow units in the upper Miocene Yinggehai Basin are studied by using 3D seismic, borehole and seismic inversion data. Two third-order sequences (SQhl2 and SQhl1) are identified, and the planar distribution of strata and turbidite deposition are controlled by different styles of slope breaks. In SQhl2, turbidite systems of subaqueous shelf fans and channels are identified. The shelf fans can be classified into early lowstand fans, late lowstand fans and highstand fans. In the early lowstand systems tract, the fans are the largest in scale (more than 700\u202fkm2), distributed in the subsidence center, and controlled by the basinward flexure slope break zone formed by fault activity. The shelf channels are classified into slope-parallel channels and slope-perpendicular channels according to the relationship between the strike of channels and the basin axis. The formation of the slope-perpendicular channels was controlled by large-scale global sea-level falls that happened 10.5\u202fMa ago. The formation of the slope-parallel channel was controlled by the flexure slope-break zone caused by activity of multiple groups of en-echelon faults. This study suggests that the development of large-scale turbidite systems in shelf sea was controlled by semi-enclosed geomorphology, fault activity and high sediment supply under sea-level falls. The semi-enclosed bay topography and local subsidence centers in the basin ensured a relatively isolated source-to-sink system, and allowed a large number of terrestrial sediments to converge intrabasin instead of being transported further to extrabasin. Fault activity formed structural slope-break zone and provided a \u201cslope system\u201d that facilitated the triggering of gravity flows on the shelf. Sharp increase of sediment supply under sea level falls contributed to the development of large-scale shelf turbidite systems. The study of large-scale turbidite system in shelf sea is of great significance for deepening the sedimentary law of gravity flow under different sedimentary backgrounds and opening up a new field for oil and gas exploration.\n               ","111":"\n                  The Eocene continental sequence investigated in this study belongs to the Salta Group; it was deposited in an intracontinental rift, the Salta Basin (NW Argentina) that evolved from the Lower Cretaceous to middle Paleogene. The Salta Group contains the Ma\u00edz Gordo and Lumbrera Fms, spans the Paleocene-early Eocene, and shows excellent exposures in the region of the Valles Calchaqu\u00edes. This research is focused on the continental facies of the Lumbrera Fm, which correspond to the early Eocene. We studied the mineralogy of the fine-grained beds of the Lumbrera Fm in five locations (Valle Encantado, Tonco, Tin Tin, Luracatao, and Obelisco) by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy in order to examine the vertical variations in clay mineralogy and their relations with global paleoclimatic changes registered during the Eocene. The microtexture of the authigenic smectite-type clays (Sm to I\/Sm R0) suggests that they mainly originated by crystallization from glassy volcanic materials. The high reactivity of the glass precludes the use of smectite-type-clay formation as an indicator of specific paleoclimatic conditions in the studied sediments. In contrast, the formation of kaolinite in sections with very low smectite proportions and a strong degree of weathering in crystalline silicates reflects intense weathering conditions and is a useful paleoclimatic proxy in terrestrial sediments. Significant variations in kaolinite\/muscovite ratios at the base and in an intermediate bed in the Lumbrera Fm at Valle Encantado suggest the presence of cyclic hyperthermals through the Ypresian stage that may be tentatively correlated with the Eocene Thermal Maxima 2 and 3, which are the largest events that have been identified at a global scale in early Eocene marine sediments.\n               ","112":"\n                  Terrigenous input is often considered detrimental for carbonate producing organisms, however, the common occurrence of mixed siliciclastic\u2013bioclastic deposits indicates that the relationship between carbonate factories and terrigenous fluxes is a complex issue. To investigate this subject, we analyzed the skeletal assemblages of the Paleogene Alpine foreland basin in a wide area encompassing NW Italy and SE France. Four different sections, Mortola, Loreto, Braux and Lauzanier, deposited between the Bartonian and the Priabonian, were studied in detail and, based on microfacies analysis, six main biofacies were recognized: i) nummulitid biofacies and ii) acervulinid and coralline algal biofacies related to shallow water; iii) nummulitid and orthophragminid biofacies and iv) coralline-algal branches and large benthic foraminifera biofacies related to intermediate depth; v) orthophragminid biofacies and vi) orthophragminid and coralline algal biofacies related to deeper settings. Thin sections and X-ray diffraction analyses show that these biofacies can be related to two major carbonate factories. The former was dominated by free-living benthic foraminifera and was characterized by a relevant terrigenous fraction, indicating free-living benthic foraminifera as the most terrigenous-tolerant group of carbonate producers of the Nummulitic Limestone system. The latter was dominated by encrusting acervulinids and coralline algae and thrived far-off major terrigenous sources. Conversely, recent and Neogene coralline algae are known to be able to tolerate high sedimentation rates. The distribution of coralline-algal-rich skeletal assemblages in the Nummulitic Limestone thus hints that Eocene coralline algae might have been fundamentally different (probably less adaptable) than their more modern counterparts.\n               ","113":"\n                  In high-density turbidite (HDT) systems, proximal deposits typically show thick beds of massive and\/or stratified sandstone capped by a thin low-density turbidite (LDT) interval of finer-grained laminated and rippled sandstone. Distally, the massive\/stratified HDT interval thins and is replaced by the LDT interval as the dominant facies. Whereas this empirical observation is common to many ancient systems worldwide, a very different relationship is found in the topographically confined Pe\u00efra Cava sub-basin in SE France. Eight prominaent beds can be correlated across much of the exposed basin (3\u202fx\u202f11\u202fkm). Three massive sandstone facies are recognised in these beds: (1) ungraded (2) graded, and (3) massive with patchy texture. In proximal and medial sections, these facies are capped by a relatively thick LDT interval comprising up to 30% of the bed thickness. Moving to distal sections, the massive facies come to dominate the bed, in some cases forming 100% of the bed thickness. Along a downslope transect, three facies tracts are defined that all differ considerably from previously described trends. Facies tract I and II comprises ungraded massive sandstone and massive sandstone with patchy texture in distal sections, respectively. Facies tract III comprises repetitive sequence of ungraded and graded massive sandstones in distal sections. Statistical analysis of the vertical internal character in the eight beds show non-random, non-cyclic facies trends, with each massive facies exhibiting some level of dependency on other facies, suggesting sediment deposition depended on temporally evolving flow conditions. The ungraded and graded massive facies are interpreted as deposits of high-concentration near bed layers beneath surge-type turbidity currents. In contrast, the massive sandstone with patchy texture is interpreted to result from liquefied debris flows. Bed thickness trends and the presence of distinctive grain size breaks indicate depositing flows were bipartite (debris flow with an overlying concentrated turbulent layer), depletive, unsteady and pulsatory in proximal locations, but evolved distally into a turbulent flows with a simple surge structure. The distal dominance of these massive facies is here interpreted as a consequence of flow interaction with confining topography. This interaction induced gravity and body transformations in flows of facies tract I and II, whereas generation and passage of internal waves in distal sections created the necessary conditions for massive sandstone deposition in facies tract III.\n               ","114":"\n                  The Messinian primary gypsum sequence, formed during the first stage of the salinity crisis in the Caltanissetta basin (Sicily), is characterized by a high degree of disruption and deformation. The primary gypsum occurs as huge (up to 3\u202fkm large and up to 250\u202fm high) tilted blocks, detached from their stratigraphic base, floating within a matrix of folded shales and clastic gypsum. This association represents a giant chaotic unit lying unconformably on the Gela Nappe, the youngest structural unit of the Maghrebian fold-and-thrust belt. The origin of the deformations affecting the Primary Lower Gypsum unit is still debated; in the past they have been related to intra-Messinian tectonics or to the collapse of primary gypsum platforms due dissolution of interbedded to halite. Our study on the distribution, size and bedding of the gypsum blocks reveals a pattern similar to that of modern giant submarine mass-transport deposits, which may have been triggered by a combination of active tectonics and sea-level change, and favored by the strong mechanical contrasts of the involved units. The chaotic unit shows a downslope evolution from the south, characterized by elongated blocks with their main axes parallel to the inferred slide headwall (NW-SE oriented), to intermediate and distal areas, where the blocks become progressively smaller in size with their main axes parallel to the flow (SW-NE). We identify the source area as either a shallow evaporitic basin above the Gela Nappe or on the Pelagian foreland ramp. A general implication for the Messinian salinity crisis is that no primary gypsum was deposited in deep water basins during the first stage; instead, during the second stage, large gypsum blocks collapsed from the basin margin and were mass-transported into a deeper water setting, where halite was depositing.\n               ","115":"\n                  The Triassic Qinling Orogenic Belt was formed during the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, and its evolution can be traced by provenance analysis of sediments in the south of North China. We present detrital zircon ages, sandstone petrographic observations, paleocurrent data, and paleogeographic reconstructions that allow the evolution of this basin\u2013mountain system to be reconstructed. Detrital zircons from upper Permian sedimentary rocks yield two major age peaks at 1876 and 259\u202fMa, and two minor age peaks at 2526 and 363\u202fMa. These zircons were likely sourced from recycled sediments in the Southern North China Block. Detrital zircons from Lower Triassic sedimentary rocks have multiple age peaks at ca. 2500, 1850, 950, 745, 450\u2013430, and 310\u2013250\u202fMa, reflecting a mixed provenance from the Qinling Orogenic Belt and Southern North China Block. Zircons from a Middle Triassic sandstone have a concentrated age peak at ca. 250\u202fMa and two subordinate age peaks at ca. 1800 and 2500\u202fMa. Hafnium isotope data for the late Paleozoic detrital zircons are characterized by negative \u03b5Hf(t) values of \u221223.11 to \u22120.11, and only two grains have positive \u03b5Hf(t) values of +1.45 and +2.10. We infer that these zircons were derived from recycled sediments in the Southern North China Block. The provenance data show that the North Qinling Belt and Southern North China Block had been uplifted prior to the Early Triassic. The uplift was mainly related to the continental collision between the South China and North China blocks. These and previously published data indicate the Southern North China Block experienced exhumation during the Middle\u2212Late Triassic, firstly involving Permian cover rocks, followed by Cambrian and Neoproterozoic strata, and finally Mesoproterozoic basement rocks. The fold-and-thrust belt in the Southern North China Block probably formed during the Middle Triassic. Uplift and denudation of the Qinling Orogenic Belt controlled Triassic basin evolution in the south of North China.\n               ","116":"\n                  Fluvial fans represent one of the dominant sedimentary systems at the active margins of non-marine foreland basins. The Puig-reig anticline at the north-eastern margin of the Ebro Foreland Basin (SE Pyrenees, Spain) exposes continuous outcrops of Late Eocene-Early Oligocene fluvial deposits, from proximal to medial fluvial fan environments. The proximal deposits are found in the north limb of the anticline, especially in the northwest zone. These deposits are characterised by conglomerates with minor interbedded sandstones, with thick and wide sheet-like geometries with unscoured or variably scoured basal surfaces. These are interpreted to be the deposits of unconfined flash floods and wide-shallow channel streams. The medial deposits, covering the rest of the anticline, consist of interbedded conglomerates, sandstones and claystones. These are interpreted to have been deposited from braided to meandering channel streams and overbank areas. Distal deposits are found towards the south, beyond the anticline, and are characterised by sandstone and clay deposits of terminal lobes and lacustrine deltas. This study assesses the impact of the primary depositional characteristics, diagenesis and deformation of the most heterolithic portion of the system, with implications for increasing our understanding of folded fluvial reservoirs. Diagenetic processes, mainly mechanical compaction and calcite cementation, resulted in overall low intergranular porosity, with limited relatively high porosity developed in sandstone lithofacies in the medial deposits. Deformation associated with thrusting and fold growth resulted in the formation of abundant fractures, with relatively high fracture intensities observed in sandstone lithofacies in the anticline crest. This study shows that post-depositional processes can both improve and diminish the reservoir potential of basin proximal fluvial deposits, through the development of fracture networks and by compaction-cementation. The comparison of the Puig-reig anticline with other similar settings worldwide indicates that foreland basin margin locations may be potential areas for effective reservoirs, even in the case of low intergranular porosity.\n               ","117":"\n                  Carbonate platforms developed in the southwestern Provence area during the late Cretaceous on the rims of a narrow deep E-W oriented basin. The upper Cenomanian lower Member Fontblanche 1 of the Fontblanche Limestones Formation is exceptionally rich in rudists. This member is well exposed in two quarries with flat outcrop surfaces, thanks to sawn surfaces, that allow 3D investigation of its litho- and biofacies and sedimentary structures. The paper describes the sedimentary sequences of each quarry from a quantitative study of both sedimentary and palaeontological data, both macroscopic and microscopic, derived from quadra counts in the field and thin section analyses. The sequences are one to several metres thick and each of them shows a basal drowning and a final emersion surface with evidence of reworking and dissolution. The microfacies are dominated by floatstone texture, most common grains being bioclasts derived from biocorrosion of rudist shells and benthic foraminifers. The matrix is made mostly of microbioclasts and micrite, resulting from a strong microborers activity. Fossil organisms are regarded as autochthonous or parautochthonous. The overall depositional environment was shallow marine with a maximum depth of a few metres in an inner, peritidal, sheltered and quiet platform. We found a link between the sedimentary facies and rudist ecotypes. The statistical analysis of the fossil counts, using multivariate statistics and clustering, differentiates four fossil assemblages, namely the Chondrodonta assemblage, the Apricardia-Sauvagesiinae assemblage, the Caprotina assemblage, and the Nerinea assemblage, which are considered to represent biotic communities. The replacement of communities through Fontblanche 1 and within the elementary sequences illustrates a relationship between the benthic communities, the degree of biocorrosion, the sedimentary texture, and the sedimentation rate so that ecological processes affect the sedimentary dynamics which in turn affects communities through feedback mechanism. Such an intimate link between the sedimentary facies and ecosystems provides evidence that biotic parameters played an important role in the rudist-rich facies succession.\n               ","118":"\n                  Terrestrial carbonate deposits associated with exposed limestone are potential recorders of paleoclimates and karst paleohydrology. Here we examine the depositional process of the Omi rhythmite layers, which filled karstic cavities in the Pennsylvanian (middle Kasimovian) section of the Omi Limestone, a seamount-type limestone in central Japan. The laminated rhythmite layers accompanied signatures of subaerial exposure, including Microcodium, which indicates a seasonally dry climate in the late Kasimovian. The rhythmite layers are calcareous, low in siliciclastic content, and composed of millimeter-scale laminae. In each lamina, the grain size decreases and the \u03b418O value increases upwards. We inferred that each lamina corresponds to a single cave flood event followed by a dry and evaporative interval. 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of the rhythmites are almost identical to the ratio of the surrounding limestone, but clearly lower than the Kasimovian seawater ratio. This indicates that the rhythmites and the surrounding limestone were subjected to the same post-depositional alteration, before the subduction of the seamount in the Guadalupian (middle Permian). The sedimentary and isotopic features of the Omi rhythmite and occurrence of Microcodium support repetition of wetting and drying on an equatorial Panthalassan island during the Pennsylvanian (late Carboniferous).\n               ","119":"\n                  Recent advances in sedimentary research have shown that quartz sandstones are scarce in the global geologic record and prolonged sediment transport does not automatically produce mineralogically mature sediments. Published data are based mainly on Cambro-Ordovician arenites. This paper discusses the formational controls of early Cretaceous syn-rift quartzose from northern Gondwana based on integrated petrographic, mineralogic, and electrofacies proxies on the Upper Sarir Sandstone Formation, Sirte Basin, Libya. The study aimed to understand the compositional framework and construe the sedimentological processes that produced the quartz-rich sandstones. Acquired samples (n\u202f=\u202f40) from three boreholes (N8-97, N7-97, and N4-97) were subjected to petrographic analysis, x-ray diffractometry, and variable pressure scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry. Qualitative and quantitative datasets indicate that the mean framework composition (Q97F0L3) of the sample is quartz-dominated and primarily detrital, although diagenetic imprints, mostly quartz cementation, quartz overgrowth, and other authigenic precipitates, are present. Evidenced by the predomination of monocrystalline quartz grains (99.10%) over the polycrystalline type (0.90%), the dominance of non-undulatory extinction (72.50%), and noticeable euhedral crystals, the compositional framework of the studied quartzose reflects a predominant plutonic provenance with some metamorphic inputs. The possibility of significant sediment reworking is ruled out based on short to moderate transport distance (~100\u202fkm) interpreted from the interplay of textural parameters, depositional model, and paleogeography. A humid paleoclimate alongside its associated rigorous chemical weathering is constrained as the dominant control in the formation of the Upper Sarir quartzose sandstone from a dominant craton interior provenance. These conditions probably produced other early Cretaceous arenitic sandstones in other reaches of North Gondwanaland.\n               "},"Text":{"0":"","1":"","2":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe action of ocean bottom currents induces selective deposition, as well as sediment winnowing and redistribution. Extensive sediment drifts may form in areas affected by the persistent action of bottom currents. The external morphology and internal architecture of these deposits have been widely studied leading to a synoptic classification based predominately on siliciclastic drifts (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2008; Rebesco et al., 2014; Shanmugam, 2017). Siliciclastic drifts have been reported to record palaeoclimatic and palaeoceanographic conditions at a higher resolution than pelagic background sedimentation (Rebesco, 2005; Rebesco et al., 2014; Shanmugam, 2017; Stow and Smillie, 2020).\nIn most cases, the identification of a sedimentary succession as a sediment drift relies on the interpretation of reflection seismic data sets where the large-scale geometry is imaged (Anselmetti et al., 2000; Ercilla et al., 2002; Bergman, 2004; Hernandez-Molina et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011, 2013, 2014; Betzler et al., 2014; Chabaud et al., 2016; L\u00fcdmann et al., 2016; Eberli and Betzler, 2019; Paulat et al., 2019). In some cases, the seismic information can be implemented with sediment information from cores and well-logs (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2013, 2014; Betzler et al., 2016, 2018; L\u00fcdmann et al., 2018; Eberli and Betzler, 2019; Reolid et al., 2019; de Castro et al., 2021). However, very few studies deal with the problem of recognizing contourite drifts in outcrops, where the characteristic seismic-scale drift geometries are not identifiable (Stow et al., 1998, 2002; Capella et al., 2018; Eberli and Betzler, 2019; Reolid and Betzler, 2019; Reolid et al., 2021; H\u00fcneke et al., 2020; de Weger et al., 2021). Contourite drift outcrops are, in fact, only scarcely recognised. This generally resulted in the lack of distinct diagnostic drift features and the underrepresentation of contourite drifts in outcrops (Huneke and Stow, 2008; Rebesco et al., 2014; Shanmugam, 2017; H\u00fcneke et al., 2020).\nThe main diagnostic criterion for the identification of contourite drift sediments in outcrops is the occurrence of bigradational sequences (Gonthier et al., 1984; Stow and Faug\u00e8res, 2008). However, this feature is not observable in muddy or sandy contourites where the homogeneity of the sediment does not allow identifying changes in grain size (Shanmugam, 2017; Stow and Smillie, 2020). A high degree of bioturbation is also characteristic of contourite drift deposits, and contributes to the homogenization of the sediment (Wetzel et al., 2008; Rodr\u00edguez-Tovar and Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina, 2018; Reolid and Betzler, 2019; Reolid et al., 2021; Bialik et al., 2022). In fossil examples cropping out onshore, carbonate drifts show traction sedimentary structures from lenticular and flaser bedding to mega cross-bedding, which are considered indicative of deposition under the action of bottom currents (Stow et al., 1998, 2002; Shanmugam, 2000; Mart\u00edn-Chivelet et al., 2008; H\u00fcneke et al., 2020; Reolid et al., 2021). However, further examples are still needed to have a good understanding of onshore drift deposits from different settings.\nFossil carbonate drifts are restricted to three main settings: 1) at the flanks of carbonate banks as periplatform drifts (Mullins and Neumann, 1979; Mullins et al., 1980; Betzler et al., 2014; Chabaud et al., 2016); 2) in seaways separating carbonate banks as detached drifts (Anselmetti et al., 2000; Bergman, 2004; L\u00fcdmann et al., 2016; Paulat et al., 2019); and 3) at the down-current end of shallow passages dissecting carbonate banks as delta drifts (L\u00fcdmann et al., 2018; Eberli et al., 2019; Reolid et al., 2019). However, little is known about the relative position of outcropping fossil drifts with respect to ancient carbonate platforms, seaways and shallow passages (Eberli and Betzler, 2019). The aim of this study is to present for the first time an onshore example of a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic drift located at the entrance of a Miocene Betic strait connecting the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea and to reconstruct the palaeoceanographic conditions that led to its formation.\nThe nearly complete separation of the Mediterranean from the Atlantic Ocean during the late Miocene (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001, 2009, 2010; Betzler et al., 2006; Flecker et al., 2015; Tulbure et al., 2017; Capella et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2021) had a global impact on the thermohaline ocean circulation and, consequently, on the climate and organic matter fluxes (P\u00e9rez-Asensio et al., 2012, 2013, 2014; Jim\u00e9nez-Moreno et al., 2013). In the Betic Cordillera, several straits connected the Mediterranean and the Atlantic throughout the Guadalquivir Basin (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001, 2009, 2014; Betzler et al., 2006; Puga-Bernab\u00e9u et al., 2022). The sedimentary infilling of these marine seaways is characterised by coarse-grained deposits displaying gigantic cross-stratifications (decametres to hectometres in length), generated by the intensification of currents in narrow straits. The study area is located at the northern end of one of these straits at the southern margin of the Guadalquivir Basin, in the central Betic Cordillera.\nThe results of this research will contribute to expand and improve the existing outcrop criteria for the recognition of contourite drift deposits. The sedimentological and palaeontological information shed light on the bottom current regime and circulation patterns of the ancient water masses in the Atlantic\/Mediterranean straits during the Messinian, a period of major palaeocenographic changes in the western Mediterranean leading up to the Messinian Salinity Crisis.\n\n\n2\nLocation and geological setting\nThe study area is located at the southern margin of the Guadalquivir Basin, the foreland basin of the Betic Cordillera (Fig. 1\n; Braga et al., 2002; Garc\u00eda-Castellanos et al., 2002, Larrasoa\u00f1a Gorosquieta et al., 2019). The Guadalquivir Basin, with a WSW-ENE elongated triangular outline, formed by flexural subsidence related to the stacking of thrust units of the Betic Cordillera caused by the north to northwest convergence of African and Eurasian plates (Mart\u00edn et al., 2009, 2014; Larrasoa\u00f1a Gorosquieta et al., 2019). The Neogene sedimentary infilling of the basin was mostly the result of the southeasternwards advancement of shallow- and deep-water deposits along the axis of the basin (Gonz\u00e1lez-Delgado et al., 2004; Mart\u00ednez del Olmo and Mart\u00edn, 2016; Reolid et al., 2016a; Mart\u00ednez del Olmo, 2019). In addition, the stacking of sediments in the Betic front produced instabilities and collapse of large amounts of reworked materials, mostly from the Triassic, that were redeposited in the basin (Mart\u00ednez del Olmo and Mart\u00edn, 2016; Mart\u00ednez del Olmo, 2019). These olistostromic deposits, the Guadalquivir Olistostromic Unit (GOU), crop out extensively at the southern margin of the basin and extend up to its axis below the surface (Divar and Cruz-Sanjuli\u00e1n, 1986). Osuna is a village located at the northern limit of the outcropping GOU, which there consists of Middle Miocene whitish-grey diatomitic marls, regionally known as \u201cmoronitas\u201d or \u201calbarizas\u201d (Cruz-Sanjuli\u00e1n, 1975; Divar and Cruz-Sanjuli\u00e1n, 1986).\nThe abandoned Osuna Quarry is approximately 30\u202fkm to the northwest of the northernmost outcrop of the Guadalhorce Corridor (Figs. 1, 2A), and the section is coeval with the deposits filling this gateway. The Guadalhorce Corridor was the last active Atlantic-Mediterranean Betic connection (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001, 2014). It was a northwest to southeast trending narrow and shallow strait with an estimated maximum width of 5\u202fkm and a maximum water depth of about 120\u202fm, developed in a tectonic linear depression produced by northwest to southeast faults (L\u00f3pez-Garrido and Sanz de Galdeano, 1999; Mart\u00edn et al., 2001). All the large-scale sedimentary structures within the Guadalhorce Corridor, including tabular and trough cross-bedding of up to 30\u202fm in set thickness, are indicative of unidirectional traction currents flowing towards the Atlantic with a northwest direction (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001). The closure of the Guadalhorce Corridor took place in the Messinian (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001; P\u00e9rez-Asensio et al., 2012).\nThe studied Upper Miocene deposits of the Osuna Quarry mostly consist of mixed siliciclastics and bioclastic carbonates containing abundant nodular and branching bryozoans and small benthic foraminifer remains, with smaller amounts of echinoid, calcareous red algal, and bivalve fragments (Verdenius, 1970). Rhodoliths are also locally present. Two thin silt beds, 10\u201315-cm thick, intercalate with the carbonates (Fig. 2B). These carbonates constitute the Cantera Member of Verdenius (1970), who emphasised that the absence of planktonic foraminifera prevented dating the Osuna carbonates. He tentatively correlated the Osuna carbonates with the carbonates extensively cropping out in Carmona (Guadaira Formation) 55\u202fkm west of Osuna. The carbonates at Carmona have been dated as Messinian (Berggren and Haq, 1976; Aguirre et al., 2015).\n\n2.1\nOceanography and palaeoceanography of the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection\nAt present, the Mediterranean Sea connects with the Atlantic Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar, where the water mass exchange is characterised by an anti-estuarine circulation pattern (W\u00fcst, 1961). This means that lower salinity waters from the North Atlantic (the Atlantic Inflow Water; AIW) flow superficially eastwards into the Mediterranean, while dense, saline intermediate and deep Mediterranean waters (the so-called Mediterranean Outflow Water; MOW) flow westward through the straits. The present-day interface between both water masses in the Strait of Gibraltar is located between 180- and 200-m water depth (Soto-Navarro et al., 2010). However, once the inflow crosses the strait the interface between the two water masses rapidly reaches depths between 200 and 300\u202fm (Millot, 2014). The westward currents associated with the MOW originate a large contourite drift system in the Gulf of Cadiz, which is >160\u202fkm long at water depths below 600\u202fm (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011, 2013, 2014). However, there are also contourite drifts developed in the Mediterranean part of the Gibraltar Strait related to the inflow of surface water as is the case of the Ceuta Drift (Ercilla et al., 2002). This Quaternary drift has a minimum water depth of 200\u202fm, which is consistent with the maximum depth of the AIW once it exits the Strait of Gibraltar (Soto-Navarro et al., 2010; Millot, 2014).\nDuring the Miocene, however, the circulation of the two water masses, the MOW and the AIW, was not concentrated through the Strait of Gibraltar but distributed in complex system of corridors in the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula, the Betic corridors, and in the northern part of Morocco, the Rifian corridors (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001, 2009, 2014; Flecker et al., 2015; Capella et al., 2018; Krijgsman et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2021). The water exchange between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic during the early Messinian was characterised by AIW inflow through the Rifian corridors and MOW outflow through the Guadalhorce Corridor (Benson et al., 1991; P\u00e9rez-Asensio et al., 2012; Flecker et al., 2015; Krijgsman et al., 2018). This circulation pattern for the Atlantic-Mediterranean water exchange during the Miocene was named by Benson et al. (1991) \u201cthe siphon model\u201d, and that has been the paradigm up to date.\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nIn the study area, the mixed carbonate-siliciclastic deposits are exposed in the vertical walls of the quarry front. This allows for three-dimensional (3-D) observations in the field and on photogrammetric models, but precludes detailed logging of stratigraphic sections. Drone images were used to obtain a complete view of the whole outcrop, as well as to observe stratigraphic sections and correlate them (Fig. 2A). Images were integrated into a 3-D photogrammetric model that was later studied using CloudCompare V2 (CloudCompare, 2021) and Virtual Reality Geological Studio (VRGeoscience Limited version 2.66.0.0) in order to estimate dip angle and direction, and thickness of the sedimentary bodies. The Osuna Quarry was also lithologically described and sampled in the accessible areas.\nForaminiferal assemblages from the size fraction >125\u202f\u03bcm were studied in two silt beds, OSU-1 and OSU-M2 (Fig. 2B; Table 1\n). Planktonic foraminifera were studied to ascertain the age of the deposits, and benthic assemblages were used to infer the palaeoenvironmental conditions. The diversity and microhabitat preferences of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages were analysed. The relative abundance of elevated epibenthic species, which are suspension feeders, was calculated as a proxy for bottom currents (Lutze and Thiel, 1989; Sch\u00f6nfeld, 1997, 2002a, 2002b; Garc\u00eda-Gallardo et al., 2017). The assemblage water-depth range (AWDR) was established by overlapping the water-depth ranges of all species from the benthic foraminiferal assemblages. The estimated water depth (EWD) is based on a quantitative palaeobathymetry calculation using the approach of P\u00e9rez-Asensio (2021), which consists of removing abundant infaunal benthic foraminifera prior to applying a transfer equation based on benthic foraminiferal water-depth ranges and presence\/absence of species. Furthermore, the percentage of transported shelf taxa and the planktonic\/benthic ratio (P\/B ratio hereafter) were calculated to infer downslope transport and palaeo-water depth, respectively (van der Zwaan et al., 1990; Murray, 1991, 2006). Additionally, twenty rock samples were taken for microfacies analysis on thin sections.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSedimentary succession\nThe studied section at the Osuna Quarry comprises a 40-m thick mixed carbonate-siliciclastic succession (Fig. 2B) that can be subdivided into three units according to the facies (Fig. 3\n) as well as the type and orientation of the sedimentary structures (Figs. 2C, 4, 5\n\n).\n\n4.1.1\nUnit 1\nThe exposed part of this unit is 33-m thick from the base of the quarry to the base of the conglomerate body of Unit 2 (Fig. 2B). The unit consists of a succession of 9 to 10 large sediment bodies, from 5 to 10\u202fm in thickness and few hundred metres of lateral extension (Fig. 2C). The facies composition is very uniform, consisting mostly of bryozoan nodules, echinoid and mollusc fragments (Fig. 3A\u2013C). Siliciclastics, mostly quartz, are common and range between a 15\u202f% and a 60\u202f% (Fig. 3C). All the bioclasts present evidence of mechanical abrasion, such as rounding and smoothing of surface features. Coralline red algal and oyster fragments can be locally up to 50\u202f% of components (Fig. 3). Intraclasts are present in some intervals. Carbonate lithofacies ranges between rudstone (Fig. 3A, B) and packstone (Fig. 3C, D). Packstone beds are usually lighter in colour than rudstone ones (Fig. 4A). The contacts between packstone and rudstone are usually sharp (Fig. 4A). The rudstone beds are poorly sorted and contain siliciclastic grains up to 3\u202fcm in size (Fig. 4B), and large bivalve fragments and rhodoliths both up to 4\u202fcm in diameter. Bryozoan nodules in these beds can be up to 3\u202fcm in size, but most bioclasts are usually around 1\u202fcm. Packstone beds have better sorting (Fig. 4C) and exhibit better-developed cross-bedding (Fig. 4D). In any case, cross-bedding is common in both facies (Fig. 6\n). At around 22\u202fm and 27\u202fm from the base of the section there are two 10-cm thick fine-grained beds consisting of silt with a few dispersed, small bioclasts (Fig. 4E, F). These are the beds sampled for the analyses of planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy and benthic foraminiferal assemblages (Table 1).\nSince the facies are very homogenous, sediment bodies within the unit are distinguished based on the displayed structures. Most bodies consist of planar cross-beds ranging in thickness from 20 to 100\u202fcm and dipping between 5 and 10\u00b0 to the S, mostly to the SE and less commonly to the SW (Fig. 5). Most of these strata display internal cross-bedding and cross-lamination also dominantly oriented to the SE (Fig. 4D) with minor structures apparently dipping to west to northwest (Fig. 6). There are two bodies, one at the bottom and another in the upper part of the unit (Fig. 2B, C), with different geometry and sedimentary structures, which are oriented to the west to northwest (Fig. 2C). The 6-m thick basal body is well stratified with concave-up foresets around 40-cm thick, which laterally pinch out to the north (Fig. 7\n). The foresets have a minimum of 5\u00b0 and a maximum inclination of ~15\u00b0. These foresets are erosively cut off at their top by the lowest sediment body dipping to the SE (Fig. 7). The 4-m thick body at the top of the unit with sedimentary structures oriented to the N (Fig. 2B, C) displays planar cross-bedding between 15 and 30\u202fcm in thickness (Fig. 8\n). The top of this body is erosively cut by the uppermost south-dipping body and both are cut by the base of the overlying unit (Fig. 8).\n\n\n4.1.2\nUnit 2\nThis unit is made up of a 0.5 to 2-m thick conglomerate body that spreads laterally for nearly 200\u202fm and thins out northwards (Fig. 2B, C). Locally, it exhibits a poorly developed internal bedding with beds around 0.5-m thick. In its northern part, the conglomerate dips around 5\u00b0 to the S (203\u00b0 SE) and becomes subhorizontal to the southern end of the outcrop following the morphology of the top of Unit 1 (Fig. 2). The erosive base of the conglomerate is irregular (Fig. 9A, B). This facies consists of terrigenous clasts ranging in size from 2 to 5\u202fcm, floating in a coarse-grained mixed siliciclastic-bioclastic sand. The clasts are mostly reddish sandstones and quartzites and are relatively well-rounded. Some clasts are encrusted by bryozoans and\/or show Gastrochaenolites sp. borings (Fig. 9C).\n\n\n4.1.3\nUnit 3\nThe uppermost unit is around 6-m thick and extends laterally for >200\u202fm (Fig. 2B, C). Individual beds range between 0.5 and 1\u202fm in thickness (Fig. 10\n). These beds are almost subhorizontal (Fig. 10). This unit consists of a well-sorted, predominantly siliciclastic (~60\u202f%) fine sand made up mainly of quartz and feldspar grains with some bioclastic components, mainly bryozoan and echinoid remains (Fig. 3E, F). Where the carbonate fraction is higher, coralline red-algal nodules and bivalve fragments are common. Larger benthic foraminifera such as Nummulitidae and Amphistegina, are also present.\nThis unit is characterised by the occurrence of herringbone structures (Fig. 10). The beds show internal cross-stratification dipping between 4\u00b0 and 17\u00b0, mainly oriented towards 325\u00b0 NE (Fig. 5). There is a subordinate cross-bedding component dipping towards 184\u00b0 S (Fig. 5).\n\n\n\n4.2\nPlanktonic foraminiferal assemblages\nBenthic foraminifera dominate the two samples collected in the Osuna Quarry, while planktonic ones are scarce and taphonomically distorted, thus precluding quantitative analysis of their relative abundance. Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are characterised by Neogloboquadrina acostaensis, N. humerosa, Globorotalia scitula, G. miotumida group, Turborotalita quinqueloba, Globigerinoides extremus, G. bulloideus, G. cf. conglobatus, and Sphaeroidinellopsis sp. Among keeled globorotaliids, we found only a few specimens of G. miotumida (Globorotalia dallii). Globigerinoides bulloideus ranges from the base of the Messinian to the top of the Zanclean (early Pliocene) (Kennett and Srinivasan, 1983; BouDagher-Fadel, 2015), suggesting that the Osuna deposits can likely be assigned to the Messinian.\n\n\n4.3\nBenthic foraminiferal assemblages\nThe benthic foraminiferal assemblage from sample OSU-1 (Fig. 2B) is dominated by Planulina ariminensis (Table 1). The most abundant additional taxa are Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi, Melonis pompilioides, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Siphonina reticulata, Cibicidoides mundulus and Cibicides refulgens (Table 1). The assemblage water-depth range (AWDR) extends from 200 to 1000\u202fm. The estimated water depth (EWD) gives a more precise palaeo-water depth of around 450\u202fm with an uncertainty from 300 to 550\u202fm (Table 1). The P\/B ratio (38.1\u202f%) and percentage of transported shelf taxa (18.2\u202f%) are low. Diversity is high according to high S and H and low D values (Table 1). Infaunal taxa are less abundant (29.1\u202f%) than epifaunal ones (70.9\u202f%). Among the latter, elevated epibenthic species represent 41\u202f% of the assemblage.\nIn the sample OSU-M2 (Fig. 2B), the benthic foraminiferal assemblage is dominated by Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi, with Cibicidoides mundulus, Cibicides refulgens, Planulina ariminensis, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Cibicides sp. and Cibicidoides sp. as most abundant secondary taxa (Table 1). The AWDR extends from 200 to 1000\u202fm, similarly to sample OSU-1. However, the EWD is lower than in sample OSU-1, with a value of around 300\u202fm and uncertainty from 200 to 400\u202fm (Table 1). The P\/B ratio and percentage of transported shelf taxa show low values of 35.9 and 12.1\u202f%, respectively. Diversity is high, but slightly lower than in sample OSU-1 as suggested by lower S and H, and higher D. The assemblage is dominated by epifauna, showing less infaunal taxa than sample OSU-1. Elevated epibenthic species relative abundance (41.5\u202f%) is very similar to that of sample OSU-1 (Table 1).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nDepositional environment\nThe three units described herein are the result of different sedimentary processes. Persistent bottom currents, fluvial discharge and tides are the main processes shaping the Osuna Quarry section.\n\n5.1.1\nLarge sedimentary structures and bottom currents\nThe first sedimentary body at the base of Unit 1 displays metre-scale concave-up foresets that can be interpreted as the internal structure of migrating dunes (Fig. 7). The sediment grain size and height of the foresets suggest that the migrating dunes that formed this body was deposited by a current flowing towards the northwest at a speed ranging from 40 to 200\u202fcm\/s using the bedform classification of Rebesco et al. (2014). The truncation of the foreset tops of this body is distinctive of contourite drift deposits in which changes in the intensity or flow direction of the bottom current result in such reactivation surfaces (Shanmugam, 2008, 2017; Rebesco et al., 2014). The truncation of the lowermost body of Unit 1 is related to the change of flow direction to the SE (Figs. 2, 7). Similar large-scale sedimentary structures were reported in siliciclastic drifts from the coeval Rifian Corridor in Morocco (Capella et al., 2018).\nCurrents flowing to the S were dominant during deposition of Unit 1 (Fig. 4). Besides the dominant large-scale structures, there are small-scale bedforms with diverse orientations (Fig. 6), that can be interpreted as oscillation ripples formed on the surface of larger dunes migrating to the south Similar structures were reported from outcrops related to equivalent settings in Pleistocene straits (Longhitano et al., 2014). Within this stratigraphic interval with southeast to southwest-oriented structures (Figs. 7, 8), there are facies changes that can be interpreted as changes in bottom current speed (Fig. 4A). The sharp contacts between well-sorted packstone and overlying poorly sorted rudstone beds (Fig. 4A) can be interpreted as reactivation surfaces representing an acceleration of currents, which necessarily exceeded the speed of 200\u202fcm\/s in order to transport sediment larger than 2\u202fmm (Shanmugam et al., 1993a, 1993b; Stow et al., 2009). Beds with abundant rhodoliths and larger siliciclastic grains (up to 3\u202fcm) were the result of the fastest currents in the section. In contrast, the two silt beds record the slowest bottom currents in Unit 1, with an approximate speed between 10 and 40\u202fcm\/s (Stow et al., 2009). This current speed range is consistent with the percentage of elevated epibenthic species found in both silt beds, which indicates a near-bottom current speed of around 35\u202fcm\/s using the equation of Sch\u00f6nfeld (2002a), which is an exponential relationship between the relative abundance of elevated epibenthic foraminifera and current velocity. The flow direction of the bottom currents changed to north to northwest during a time interval in the upper part of Unit 1, returning again to a S direction before its end (Fig. 8).\nA persistent bottom current at the northern entrance of the Guadalhorce Corridor is considered responsible for the formation of the Osuna Quarry sequence of Unit 1, dominantly dipping to the S (Fig. 2). The occurrence of large-scale traction structures, the presence of sharp contacts among facies interpreted as reactivation surfaces and the dominance of the main flow direction deduced from the sedimentary structures are diagnostic criteria for classifying the Unit 1 of the Osuna Quarry as a contourite drift (Shanmugam et al., 1993a, 1993b). The bottom currents were persistent in time according to the dominance of unidirectional structures, either flowing to the north at the bottom and top of the sequence or flowing to the S in the rest of the succession.\n\n\n5.1.2\nComposition and texture of the sediment\nThe degree of fragmentation and abrasion of the allochems is consistent with the action of strong bottom currents (Mart\u00edn-Chivelet et al., 2003, 2008; Longhitano et al., 2014; Rebesco et al., 2014; L\u00fcdmann et al., 2018; Eberli and Betzler, 2019; Reolid et al., 2019; Longhitano and Chiarella, 2020). The bioclastic fraction of the facies with abundant bryozoans, echinoids, molluscs, and red algae is a typical Miocene bryomol assemblage (Nelson, 1988). Estimated water depths based on benthic foraminiferal assemblages from the two silt beds within Unit 1 suggest a deep environment with palaeo-water depths ranging from around 220 to 550\u202fm (Table 1). The abundance of the deep-water species C. wuellerstorfi and C. mundulus supports this water depth range (van Morkhoven et al., 1986; Holbourn et al., 2013; P\u00e9rez-Asensio et al., 2017). Preferential destruction of less-resistant planktonic foraminiferal shells by the action of energetic bottom currents might explain the anomalously low P\/B ratio values (Table 1), which are much lower than values recorded in deep settings (van der Zwaan et al., 1990; Murray, 1991, 2006). Speeds of 25\u201330\u202fcm\/s are the minimum required for moving rhodoliths (Marrack, 1999), but higher speeds of at least 80\u202fcm\/s are needed to initiate the movement of rhodoliths around 5\u202fcm in size (Harris et al., 1996). These current-speed values are consistent with the values inferred from the epibenthic percentage in the benthic foraminifera assemblage (Table 1). The grain size of some of the bioclasts of the Osuna Drift, especially rhodoliths and some bryozoan nodules (up to 3\u20134\u202fcm), suggests that the source area should not be far from the place of final deposition, since it is difficult for bottom currents alone, without the combined action of turbidity currents, to transport such coarse grains for long distances (Lima et al., 2007; Coletti et al., 2015; Bassi et al., 2017).\nWith respect to the siliciclastics, their composition with abundant quartz and feldspar as well as sandstone lithoclasts indicates that the most likely source area was to the south, where Triassic materials crop out (Verdenius, 1970; Cruz-Sanjuli\u00e1n, 1975; Divar and Cruz-Sanjuli\u00e1n, 1986). The Guadalquivir Olistotrome Units formed the main emergent areas at the time of deposition of Unit 1 (Fig. 1). The Triassic rocks involved in the large blocks of the GOU are sandstone, clay, and gypsum typical of the Keuper facies (Divar and Cruz-Sanjuli\u00e1n, 1986). The erosion of these rocks provided terrigenous material that reached the coast by alluvial discharge and was later redistributed in the basin by bottom currents. The conglomerate body of Unit 2 represents an event of intense alluvial input in a relatively nearshore shallow environment, likely related to uplift of the southern margin of the Guadalquivir Basin. This is consistent with the size of clasts and the presence of Gastrochaenolites. The uplift hypothesis fits with the regional tectonic regime of the Betic Cordillera during the late Miocene (L\u00f3pez-Garrido and Sanz de Galdeano, 1999; Galindo-Zald\u00edvar et al., 2019) and explains the abrupt change from a relatively deep palaeoenvironment controlled by bottom currents, Unit 1, to a shallow one, Unit 2 and Unit 3.\n\n\n5.1.3\nTide controlled sedimentation\nUnit 3 displays two sets of cross-bedding with different directions, a dominant dipping to the northwest and a subordinate to the S (Figs. 5, 10). Despite the dominant northward stratification (Fig. 10), the alternation of cross-bedding with two orientations results in a characteristic herringbone structure typical of environments dominated by tides (Davis, 2012). The contacts separating successive beds with internal structures migrating to the northwest are interpreted as reactivation surfaces, also indicative of tidal influence (Klein, 1970; Davis, 2012). These reactivation surfaces separate bedsets with different orientation of the sediment structures and the same facies, in contrast with the reactivation surfaces in the drift unit (Unit 1, Fig. 4A) where grain size significantly changes at the surface. The grain-size variation at the reactivation surfaces in Unit 1 resulted from intensification of the bottom currents in contrast with the tidal origin of the reactivation surfaces in Unit 3. The latter surfaces were generated because the subordinate current, the one flowing to the southeast, was not always strong enough to reverse the direction of migrating foresets, but it eroded the sediment of the upper part of the previous bed producing an erosional surface (Davis, 2012). The prevalent action of currents flowing to the northwest resulted in the stacking of 0.5\u20131-m thick beds with cross-stratification pointing in that direction (Fig. 10). Only during periods of enhanced tidal currents flowing towards the S, cross-bedding pointing towards the southeast developed.\n\n\n\n5.2\nPalaeogeography and palaeoceanography\nCarbonate drifts with fossil assemblages and grain sizes similar to those of the Osuna Drift are relatively rare (Viana, 2001; L\u00fcdmann et al., 2018; Eberli et al., 2019; Reolid et al., 2019; Reolid and Betzler, 2019), in comparison with their fine-grained counterparts (Stow et al., 1998, 2002; Huneke and Stow, 2008; Betzler et al., 2014; Rebesco et al., 2014; Bunzel et al., 2017; Reolid and Betzler, 2019; Reolid et al., 2021; Stow and Smillie, 2020; H\u00fcneke et al., 2020). Contourite drift deposits with coarse-grained concentrations develop in response to high-velocity bottom-current activity in shallow straits, narrow contourite moats, and passageways (Rebesco et al., 2014; Longhitano et al., 2014; L\u00fcdmann et al., 2018; Eberli and Betzler, 2019; Eberli et al., 2019; Reolid et al., 2019). We propose that the Osuna Drift formed at the northern entrance of the Guadalhorce Corridor that connected the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea during the Late Miocene (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001, 2014). The location of the Osuna Quarry, approximately 30\u202fkm to the northwest of the northernmost outcrop of the Guadalhorce Corridor (Figs. 1, 11A), and the age of the studied section are consistent with this interpretation.\nThe northwest sedimentary structures recorded in the Guadalhorce Corridor are unidirectionally directed towards the northwest (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001). This flow direction of the bottom currents is consistent with the siphon model of Benson et al. (1991), suggesting that the water exchange between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic during the early Messinian was characterised by Atlantic inflow (AIW) through the Rifian Corridors and Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) through the Guadalhorce Corridor (Benson et al., 1991; P\u00e9rez-Asensio et al., 2012). However, the dominance of structures oriented towards the southeast in the Osuna Drift seems to contradict the siphon model of Benson et al. (1991). The occurrence of AIW through the Rifian Corridors during the Miocene has been repeatedly reported (Fig. 11A; Flecker et al., 2015; Capella et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2021), but the Osuna Drift is the first evidence of Atlantic inflow through a Betic corridor during the Messinian.\nAt present, lower salinity waters from Atlantic (AIW) flow superficially eastward into the Mediterranean, and dense, saline intermediate and deep Mediterranean waters flow westward (MOW) promoting the occurrence of two drift systems related to both opposite bottom currents, inflow and outflow, in the area of the Strait of Gibraltar at different water depths (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011, 2013, 2014; Ercilla et al., 2002). This can be an analogue for the opposite directions observed in the Osuna Drift and its coeval deposits in the Guadalhorce Corridor.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. (2014) already stated that relative sea-level fluctuations related to glaciations or regional tectonics during the Quaternary might result in variations in the intensity of the MOW and its expression in the sedimentary record. It was proposed that the MOW is weaker during lowstands (Nelson et al., 1999; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014). Relative sea-level changes, which were common and of significant amplitude during the Messinian (Reolid et al., 2016b), together with the deepening of the interface between two water masses at the exit of a strait (Millot, 2014), can explain the different bottom current directions recorded in the Osuna Drift. During relative sea-level highstands, dense saline bottom waters flowed from the Messinian through the Guadalhorce Corridor and then descended until reaching the deeper environment at the exit of the strait, where bottom currents generated the northwest migrating dunes found at the bottom of the Osuna Quarry (Figs. 2, 7, 11B). When the sea level was relatively lower, at water depths from around 220 to 550\u202fm of water depth (Table 1), the AIW currents were enhanced in the Osuna area resulting in sediment bodies migrating towards the southeast (Fig. 11C). This situation was later reverted during deposition of the upper body in Unit 1 with structures oriented again to the northwest.\nThe deposition of the conglomerate body of Unit 2 marks a change in the style of sedimentation. Unit 2 was likely linked to tectonic uplift of the southern margin of the Guadalquivir Basin. It is possible that this tectonic arrangement finally caused the closure of the Guadalhorce Corridor (Fig. 11D) (Mart\u00edn et al., 2001). After that, the Osuna area was affected only by the Atlantic tidal currents reaching the Guadalquivir Basin (Fig. 11E). The morphology of this area, inherited from the previous Guadalhorce Corridor probably limited the flow direction of the tides resulting in the dominant northwest orientation of the sedimentary structures of Unit 3 (Fig. 10E).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis work presents a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic contourite drift developed at the northern entrance of the Guadalhorce Corridor, a Messinian seaway connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean through the Guadalquivir Basin in the Betic Cordillera (S Spain). Based on the facies and sedimentary structures, the studied Osuna Quarry section was divided in three units: 1) the lower Unit 1 comprises a 33-m thick succession of large bodies with large-scale cross-stratification pointing to the southeast and secondarily to the northwest; 2) Unit 2 consists of a 2 to 0.5-m thick conglomerate body eroding the top of Unit 1; and 3) Unit 3, is a 6-m thick body with herringbone cross-stratification and a dominant direction of the structures to the northwest.\nUnit 1 can be interpreted as a contourite drift deposit due to the occurrence of: 1) up to 10-m thick sediment bodies with planar or through mega cross-bedding; 2) two dominant directions of the sedimentary structures; and 3) reactivation surfaces usually marked by changes in the grain size of the sediment. The two flow directions recorded by the sedimentary structures are related to the position of the contourite drift at the northern end of the coeval Guadalhorce Corridor. The dominance of sedimentary structures pointing to the southeast is the result of the Atlantic inflow into the Mediterranean, while the structures oriented to the northwest record the Mediterranean outflow through the corridor. The dominance of either inflow or outflow waters through the strait was likely modulated by relative sea-level fluctuations. The conglomerate of Unit 2 suggests regional uplift of the southern margin of the Guadalquivir Basin that promoted a turnover in the depositional mode from a bottom-current dominated (Unit 1) to a tide-dominated environment (Unit 3). This tectonic pulse recorded by the increase in the amount and grain size of siliciclastics was likely related to the closure of the Guadalhorce Corridor.\nThe Osuna Drift indicates for the first time the occurrence of bottom currents related to the Atlantic inflow through the Betic Cordillera during the Messinian which so far were only reported to occur through the Rifian Corridors. This also contradicts the classical \u201cSiphon\u201d model for the Atlantic-Mediterranean bottom-current circulation pattern during the Messinian and sheds light on the complex palaeoceanography during the Late Miocene that predates the Messinian salinity crisis.\n\n","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSeismites are layers characterized by abundant seismically triggered soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDSs) (Seilacher, 1969) over long distance (van Loon et al., 2016). Some types of brittle deformation may also be classified as seismites (Montenat et al., 2007). Soft-sediment deformation structures, particularly seismites, are strongly influenced by the sedimentary environment since they usually occur at surface or close to it, where sedimentary processes physically interact with unconsolidated sediments (Allen, 1982; Moretti et al., 2016). Accordingly, seismites are useful tools for reconstructing paleoenvironments and paleoseismicity in sedimentary basins. SSDSs have been most frequently found in siliciclastic deposits comprised of fine-grained sediments with contrasted granulometry since these are the most earthquake-prone sediments (Montenat et al., 2007).\nEvaporites, including gypsum rocks, show abundant hydroplastic deformations (SSDSs), commonly interpreted as diagenetic processes caused by intrasediment precipitation, burial and consolidation, or mineral reactions associated to volume change (Warren, 2016). Other SSDSs are related to depositional slopes and resedimentation of gypsum\/anhydrite deposits by high-density flows (Vai and Ricci-Lucchi, 1977; Peryt and Kasprzyk, 1992; Peryt and Jasionowski, 1994; Rouchy et al., 1995), which can be interpreted as turbidites produced by seismic shocks (Peryt and Kasprzyk, 1992; Peryt and Jasionowski, 1994). However, sensu stricto seismites (Montenat et al., 2007; Shanmugam, 2016) have been scarcely documented in ancient gypsum\u2013anhydrite rocks (Rossetti and G\u00f3es, 2000; Bachmann and Aref, 2005; El Taki and Pratt, 2012). Modern analogs for gypsum seismites are even rarer, apart from descriptions provided by Aref (1998) in Holocene deposits of Egypt.\nThe scarcity of seismic deformation structures reported in evaporites may be due to the cohesive behavior of the early cemented sediment, the similarity of crystallization structures with deformations caused by seismic shocks, and the pervasive diagenetic processes that obliterate those features (Bachmann and Aref, 2005). This may render evaporite SSDS interpretation difficult, particularly in weathered outcrops.\nExceptionally, clastic gypsum deposits with good preservation of depositional structures, including SSDSs, occur in Miocene lacustrine successions of the Madrid and Duero basins, central Spain (Mediavilla, 1986-1987; Sanz-Montero et al., 1994; Sanz-Montero, 1996; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2007). On basis of detailed analyses of undeformed dolomitic rocks overlying the clastic gypsum deposits of the Duero basin, Sanz-Montero et al. (2008) concluded that microbial mats thriving in the lakes mediated the precipitation of dolomite and the associated minerals, resulting in extensive formation of microbialites in shallow lakes. However, the appearance of microbial textures and structures in gypsum rocks may differ from that of carbonates deposited in more diluted conditions (Sanz-Montero et al., 2009). This work aims to study the type of microbial features preserved in gypsum deposited in shallow saline lakes of the Madrid and Duero Basins. The occurrence of modern lacustrine environments where similar microbial deposits are forming in central Spain (Sanz-Montero and Rodr\u00edguez-Aranda, 2013; Sanz-Montero et al., 2015; Cabestrero et al., 2018) helps to interpreting microbial features in ancient gypsum rocks (Rouchy and Monty, 2000). In addition, the occurrence of deformation structures in these rocks provides a unique opportunity of investigating the development and preservation of deformation structures in microbial gypsum rocks. Based on the study of the two basins, this research shows the diversity of SSDSs in microbial gypsum deposits and provides criteria to interpret such structures as seismites. Spatial and temporal evolution of seismites in sulfate rocks helps to understanding the seismogenic behavior of both microbial gypsum and faults in environments depleted of siliciclastic deposits.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nSedimentary structures were studied in two 400\u202fkm-separated gypsum-bearing successions in the center of the Iberian Peninsula (Figs. 1, 2 and 3\n\n\n). The successions are located in the Madrid and Duero basins that are Cenozoic continental depressions separated by the Central System mountain range (Fig. 1). The Central System is a thick-skin chain with a NE\u2013SW structural trend that formed during the Alpine orogeny (Calvo et al., 1996). The Alpine deformation was accomplished during the Oligocene\u2013Miocene under a NW\u2013SE to NNW\u2013SSE shortening (De Vicente et al., 2011). The Variscan basement structures of the basins reactivated and worked as strike-slip faults. Such faults acted as lateral ramps of the thrust structures that lift the basin margins during the lower\u2013middle Miocene (De Vicente et al., 2011; De Vicente and Mu\u00f1oz-Mart\u00edn, 2013). Each of the study-zones is close to these lateral ramps in the Madrid and Duero basins (Fig. 1).\n\n2.1\nMadrid Basin\nThe Miocene record of the Madrid Basin is divided into three main flat-lying lithostratigraphical units: Lower, Intermediate and Upper (Calvo et al., 1996), each separated by discontinuities related to major tectonic activity in the margins (Fig. 1). The studied sedimentary successions form the basal part of the Intermediate Unit (Burdigalian) that lies paraconformably on the deposits of the Lower Unit (Rodr\u00edguez-Aranda et al., 2002). The general sedimentary framework for the Intermediate Unit is established as an alluvial fan-saline lake complex characteristic of a hydrologically closed basin (Calvo et al., 1996), where the lacustrine carbonate and gypsum interfinger with mudstones in marginal areas of the lakes. The up to 10\u202fm thick studied profiles are located in a radius of 10\u202fkm around the town of Huerta de Valdecar\u00e1banos (HV), nearby a NW\u2013SE right-lateral strike-slip fault related with the south margin of the basin (Toledo Mountains) (Fig. 1). The profiles consist of gypsum (clastic and microbialites), gysiferous mudstone, and dolomite layers (Figs. 2, 4A, 5A, C\n). The succession deposited in saline mudflat-shallow lake environments affected by storm events (Sanz-Montero et al., 1994; Sanz-Montero, 1996).\n\n\n2.2\nDuero Basin\nSeven main lithostratigraphic units have been distinguished in the sedimentary record of the Duero Basin (Armenteros et al., 2002) (Fig. 1A). The present study is focused on the 5\u202fm thick basal interval of the up to 80\u202fm thick stratigraphical section outcropping in the Cu\u00e9llar (CU) area (Sanz-Montero et al., 2008). The gypsum-bearing outcrops (Fig. 1B) are sited along a 23\u202fkm band in the vicinity of a NW\u2013SE left-lateral strike-slip fault (Fig. 1). Gypsum beds comprise the uppermost middle Miocene succession in the area, which is equivalent to the sedimentary stage 5 of Armenteros et al. (2002). Deposits of stage 5 lie horizontally on a disconformity that resulted from the uplift of the Central System. During this stage marginal alluvial fans grew and fed large fluvial systems that progressively receded and gave way to gypsiferous shallow saline lakes in the Serravalian (Armenteros, 1991; Armenteros et al., 2002; Sanz-Montero et al., 2008). The study successions consist of gypsum interbedded with gypsiferous mudstone and marlstone facies (Figs. 3, 4B, C, 5B, D).\n\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\nField work involved delimitation and selection of well-exposed outcrops around the villages of Cu\u00e9llar (41\u00b024\u203210\u2033N; 4\u00b019\u203212\u2033W) and Huerta de Valdecar\u00e1banos (39\u00b049\u203249.33\u2033N; 3\u00b037\u20327.03\u2033W) located in the Duero and Madrid Basins, respectively. Selected outcrops, mainly inactive gypsum quarries and underground mines, were logged and sampled after detailed examination of sedimentary and deformation structures. Besides, geological and topographical maps as well as satellite and aerial photos have been observed to identify fault traces. The mineralogy of samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Random powder XRD analyses were carried out for total mineralogy and oriented mounts for clay determinations using a Philips PW-1710 diffractometer and Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer under monochromatic Cu K\u03b1 radiation operating at 40\u202fkV and 30\u202fmA. Optical and fluorescence examinations of standard thin-sections stained for carbonates were performed with a white light source and a green-ultraviolet filter, respectively. Generally, soft samples were dehydrated by lyophilization, embedded and impregnated with Epofix resin in order to prepare thin sections. High-resolution textural and morphometric analyses were carried out using secondary electron microscopic (SEM) images and backscattered (BSE) micrographs with elemental composition. They were obtained using SEM-EDAX of a JEOL JSM-6400 operating at 20\u202fkV and equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSedimentary successions and paleoenvironment\nThe studied successions of Duero (CU) and Madrid (HV) basins comprise gypsum microbialites interbedded with gypsiferous mudstone and marlstone that can be traceable laterally for several tens of meters and several hundred meters, respectively (Figs. 2\u20135). In CU, successions are overlaid by gently dipping marlstone beds that laterally may disappear (Fig. 4B). In HV, gypsiferous beds pass sharply into massive mudstone.\nDistinctively, the sequences in both areas show SSDSs and synsedimentary microfractures. Mudstone and marlstone deposits contain variable amounts of carbonate, mainly dolomite. In CU, green dolomitic marlstones including lenticular gypsum (mm\u2013cm in diameter) occur as 2\u201350\u202fcm thick tabular beds (Figs. 3, 4C, 5B, 10C, E, F). It is remarkable the absence of quartz and feldspars grains in these beds. The mineralogy of phyllosilicates consists of illite (30\u201360\u202f%), smectite (10\u201340\u202f%), palygorskite (10\u201335\u202f%), sepiolite (0\u201315\u202f%) and kaolinite (<10\u202f%). In HV, these facies form greenish or reddish tabular beds from 5 to 100\u202fcm in thickness and several hundred meters of lateral continuity (Figs. 2, 4A, 8, 9). The facies comprise intrasediment-grown gypsum crystals (up to 50\u202f% by volume) that are 0.5 to 3\u202fmm in size and show subeuhedral and hemipyramidal shapes. The phyllosilicates include illite (50\u201390\u202f%), palygorskite (0\u201325\u202f%), smectite (0\u201320\u202f%) and kaolinite (5\u201310\u202f%). Minor quartz and dolomite are also present (<10\u202f%).\nThe general sedimentary model for the successions is established as an alluvial fan-saline lake complex characteristic of a hydrologically-closed basin (Fig. 1). Mudstone and marlstone lithologies represent deposition in a saline lake margin during dilution episodes (Sanz-Montero, 1996; Sanz-Montero et al., 2008). In modern gypsum depositing lakes, illite and smectites are interpreted to be predominantly derived from basin margins, whereas palygorskite, sepiolite and some smectites are observed to form in situ, as well as gypsum and carbonates (Del Buey et al., 2018, 2021).\n\n\n4.2\nGypsum microbialites\n\n4.2.1\nDescription\nThe term microbialites is used here in the sense of Grey and Awramik (2020), i.e., embracing both the lithified microbial mats and the microbial induced sedimentary structures, MISS (Noffke et al., 2001; Noffke, 2010). The average thickness of microbialites ranges between 5 and 20\u202fcm in CU (Figs. 3, 4B, C) and between 10 and 50\u202fcm in HV (Figs. 2, 4A). The microbialites comprise gypsum (50\u201385\u202f%), commonly showing clastic texture, dolomite (5\u201340\u202f%), phyllosilicates (10\u201330\u202f%) and locally ankerite (up to 8\u202f%). SEM analysis also detects minor although pervasive celestite crystals (Fig. 7B).\nMicrobialites are characterized by laterally extensive planar to undulated laminated structure, vaguely defined ripple marks and cross-bedding. Planar and continuous laminae of carbonates commonly cover the upper planes of the beds, forming laminated leveling structures (Figs. 5D, F, 10C). Besides, mat clasts occur on the top of some beds (Fig. 5F). Erosive bases are seldom observed (Figs. 2, 3).\nIn thin sections, the laminated gypsum encompasses mm lamina of carbonate and intrasediment-grown gypsum crystals. The latter commonly show a matrix-supported fabric, with gypsum crystals lying horizontally and embedded by a dark matrix (Fig. 6A). Under fluorescence microscopy the matrix fluoresces, indicating that it contains carbonaceous compounds in addition to fine sized dolomite, minor phyllosilicates (mainly sepiolite) and celestite (Figs. 6A, B, 7B\u2013D). SEM analysis reveals that the carbonaceous substances form smooth films on which dolomite and celestite are nucleated as isolated crystals. Pervasively, dolomite crystals contain an inner, spheroidal hole (Fig. 7D). Gypsum crystals are predominantly lenticular, but hemipyramidal euhedral to rounded shapes are also observed (Figs. 6, 7A). Monocrystalline gypsum grains are far more abundant than twinned crystals and aggregates. Clear and idiomorphic gypsum overgrowths formed in repeated episodes of cementation commonly cover in optical continuity the original nucleus, which are dark due to the matrix inclusions (Fig. 6A\u2013D). The surfaces of the crystals show heavy pitting corrosion filled by the components of the matrix (Fig. 6F).\nLaminated gypsum occurs associated to gypsum beds showing vaguely defined ripple marks and cross-bedding. These deposits are gypsarenite as they comprise fine to coarse sand sized crystals (0.064\u20132\u202fmm) in the Madrid basin (Figs. 4A, 5A, C, 6C,D, 7A ), and fine to medium sized grains (0.064\u20130.5\u202fmm) in the Duero basin (Figs. 4B, C, 5B, D, F, 6A, B). In thin sections the gypsarenites are made up of abraded gypsum grains as well as intraclasts of dolomite and mudstone (Fig. 6A, E). The formation of synsedimentary overgrowths of gypsum, infilling the intergranular spaces, results in a crystal-supported fabric that obliterates the abrasion features and very often the crossbedding (Figs. 6C, 7A). Under a microscope, ripple crests consist of inclined laminae of gypsum alternating with thin laminae of carbonates, while the ripple throughs are commonly filled with horizontal laminae of gypsum and carbonate. The tops of successive ripple crests appear outlined by carbonate drapes that overprint the topography (Figs. 5D, 6B).\n\n\n4.2.2\nInterpretation\nThe occurrence of ancient gypsum deposits showing wavy to planar laminites and columnar buildups, has been reported in different locations. These deposits are named mineralized or gypsified microbial mats; or, more generally, gypsum microbialites (Rouchy and Monty, 2000; Babel, 2004; Allwood et al., 2013; Sanz-Montero et al., 2013). Similar laminated gypsum deposits are also forming in modern hypersaline settings where microbial mats develop (Ort\u00ed et al., 1984; Rouchy and Monty, 2000; Sanz-Montero et al., 2013; Cabestrero and Sanz-Montero, 2018; Cabestrero et al., 2018; Aref et al., 2020; Del Buey et al., 2021). Observations in modern saline lakes of central Spain have revealed that subaqueous precipitation of gypsum crystals does not proceed spontaneously in the water. Instead, fine crystals of lenticular gypsum nucleate within the microbial mats together with carbonates, phyllosilicates and celestite, forming vaguely laminated to massive microbialite deposits (Sanz-Montero et al., 2013; Cabestrero and Sanz-Montero, 2018; Cabestrero et al., 2018; Del Buey et al., 2021). The intrasediment growth of gypsum and associated minerals is favored by the EPS matrix ability of the microbial mats of sequestering large amounts of S, Si, Ca and Mg, among others, from the overlying water (Del Buey et al., 2021). Unlike other sulfates, the lenticular gypsum crystallizes distinctively within mats in the submerged areas of the lake (Del Buey et al., 2021). As Miocene crystals, modern gypsum shows distinctive overgrowth and corroded zones reflecting episodic stages of growth and dissolution controlled by the seasonal variations in the geochemical conditions of the water (Cabestrero and Sanz-Montero, 2018). The activity of sulfate reducing bacteria and other microorganisms may also favor the corrosion and dissolution of sulfates (Sanz-Montero et al., 2006; Ayll\u00f3n-Quevedo et al., 2007). To a lesser extent, the nucleation of dolomite and other carbonates, Mg-phyllosilicates and celestite also occurs on the microbial matrices of modern lakes (Sanz-Montero et al., 2013; Cabestrero and Sanz-Montero, 2018; Del Buey et al., 2021). Very often, carbonate microcrystals display hollow spheroid cores (Cabestrero and Sanz-Montero, 2018) that could represent former sites of microbial occupancy (Sanz-Montero et al., 2006; Ayll\u00f3n-Quevedo et al., 2007; Sanz-Montero et al., 2009). In Miocene rocks, the good preservation of many of such features as well as fluorescent and carbonaceous films also suggest that mineral precipitation occurs in microbial biofilms. Thus, beds containing intrasediment-grown gypsum are interpreted as lithified microbial mats.\nBesides, Sanz-Montero and Rodr\u00edguez-Aranda (2013) and Sanz-Montero et al. (2015) observed the formation of mat deformation structures (sensu Noffke et al., 2001) in modern gypsum-bearing microbial mats during storm events. They illustrated among others, mat fragments, wrinkle mat piles, gas domes, mud holes, scour marks, and ripple marks with complex patterns. It was also described how drapes of organic-rich mud eroded from the upper millimeters of sediment deposited between the ripple crests and depressions, resulting in the leveling of the surface (Sanz-Montero et al., 2015). In addition, the rapid overgrowth of the sedimentary structures by microbial mats (Sanz-Montero and Rodr\u00edguez-Aranda, 2013), plays a role in the biostabilization and preservation of the gypsum deposits as also reported in siliciclastic depositional environments (Noffke et al., 2001; Cuadrado et al., 2011; Cuadrado, 2020). Similar mat fragments, intraclasts, ripple marks and leveling structures are well preserved in Miocene gypsum rocks, which allow reconstructing the hydrodynamic conditions and bed forms produced by windstorms in the ancient lakes of Duero and Madrid basins.\nIn summary, two types of traces of life (i.e., biosignatures) are detected in Miocene gypsum deposits (Table 1\n): morphostructural, including MISS, and geochemical, embracing organic and inorganic signatures. The latter includes a group of bioinduced minerals that exhibit distinctive textural and compositional features. These biosignatures are also common in modern saline lakes.\n\n\n\n4.3\nDescription and interpretation of synsedimentary deformation structures\nIn addition to MISS, gypsum beds show an association of different soft sediment deformation structures (SSDSs) and fractures that extent several kilometers laterally (Figs. 8\u201311\n\n\n\n). In this paper the classification of structures is based mainly on the geometry of the deformations described in siliciclastic deposits. Table 2\n shows the classification along with a description of the geometry, lithologies, and the frequency of the deformation structures. Most of them appear in the two study basins, although with some particularities that are outlined in the descriptions. In general, the size and vertical repetition of deformed layers is greater in HV than in CU (Table 2).\n\n4.3.1\nLoad cast structures\nIn the Madrid Basin, load casts develop on the lower surfaces of three gypsarenite beds (Figs. 2, 8), apparently following SE\u2013NW directions. Load structures are often grouped in successions of 4\u201312 individuals separated by approximately periodic spacing that can be associated with convolute bedding features (Figs. 2, 8B, 9F).\nIn the Duero basin, the load casts appear as small bodies that seldom form drops and pillows collapsed into the lower beds (Fig. 10B).\nLoad structures form when a higher bulk density layer rests on a layer of lower bulk density (Owen, 2003). A gravitational readjustment occurs if the shear stress of the lower layer is reduced by liquidization and thixotropic processes, commonly after a seismic shake or a rapid sedimentation event. Thus, the layer of relatively higher density collapses while the layer of lower density, that is water saturated, moves upward (Alfaro et al., 1997; Montenat et al., 2007). In the Miocene successions, the overlying gypsum is denser and more lithified than the underlying beds due to their high contents in dolomite and\/or gypsum overgrowths. Rather than sudden deposition mechanisms, the biochemical precipitation of gypsum, the orientation of some pillow structures and the shallow condition of the saline lakes support an origin related to synsedimentary earthquakes.\n\n\n4.3.2\nDish structures\nDish structures are generally associated to water escape conducts and small plastic intrusions of mudstone or marlstone (Figs. 9C, 10C).\nThe combination of the dewatering of fine-grained deposits and the compaction of sediments causes bending, breakage, and modification of the more rigid, interbedded laminae (Hurst and Cronin, 2001), in the study cases represented by gypsarenite.\n\n\n4.3.3\nConvolute bedding and lamination\nIn the Madrid basin the convoluted beds display complex folding styles such as straight, recumbent and overturned (Fig. 8B\u2013D). Undeformed intervals of only a few meters are observed between contiguous convoluted stretches. The lower bedding surface of the deformed beds is rather flat; at the top, load casts are common (Figs. 2, 8).\nIn the Duero basin deformation takes the form of complex folds and pseudonodules consisting of crystalline gypsum (Figs. 3, 10C). In addition, convolution at the scale of centimeters occurs in gypsum beds with dolomite laminae that are commonly fragmented (Fig. 10A, C).\nThe origin of this structure is related to fluidization, dewatering and folding of a layer formed by sub-layers of different densities induced by loading, current shear, or slumping (Rossetti and G\u00f3es, 2000; Montenat et al., 2007). The occurrence of this structure in laterally continuous horizons, separated by undeformed beds, suggests a seismic trigger (Moretti and Van Loon, 2014; Shanmugam, 2016). The weak post-deformation effects of compaction observed in the folds have been further interpreted as evidence of rapid dewatering caused by earthquakes (Montenat et al., 2007). Along the same terms, lateral changes in the convoluted bed indicate different stages of fluidization, characteristic of seismic shocks (Montenat et al., 2007).\n\n\n4.3.4\nFluid escape tubes\nFluid escape tubes locally run parallel to fractures (Fig. 10D). The tubes can be hollow or cemented by carbonates and gypsum (Figs. 5E, F, 9D).\nThese structures indicate fluid escape motion upwards, mainly because of dewatering after sediment fluidization. On occasions, fractures contribute to fluid migration. When the tubes are not associated with deformation structures, other possible mechanisms, such as rising gases within microbial mats, may have played a role in the creation of the features (Aref, 1998). The occurrence of carbonates and gypsum cements evidences seepage of fluids of different composition through the pipes. It is beyond the scope of this study to analyze the cements, although they represent an important tool to improve understanding of synsedimentary diagenesis of microbial gypsum deposits.\n\n\n4.3.5\nFractures\nFractures cut specific gypsum beds that appear underlain and overlain by undeformed strata (Figs. 2\u20134). Locally, small reverse faults are associated to convolute bedding and lamination (Figs. 8B, C, 10D). Besides, fractures may be related to mud\/sand volcanoes (Fig. 11), plastic intrusions (Figs. 4C, 9E) and fluid escape tubes (Fig. 10D). In HV, fractures locally define small synsedimentary grabens filled by mudstone (Fig. 9A, C).\nThe limited location of these joints and faults to specific beds as well as their association with other deformation structures support that they are synsedimentary features. Fractures are brittle deformation structures that indicate that the affected gypsum layers were partly lithified and rather rigid.\n\n\n4.3.6\nPlastic intrusions\nPlastic intrusions or injectites are commonly related to one or two fractures, load casts and\/or dish structures (Fig. 9C, E). In HV, they often evolve upwards to Neptunian dikes (Fig. 9A\u2013C, E).\nIn CU area, the intruding material contains high percentages (ca. 50\u202f%) of palygorskite and sepiolite (Fig. 10E, F) and occurs associated to preferentially NW\u2013SE oriented fractures. Besides, cm-sized plastic intrusions, often occur associated with fluid escape tubes and micro-fractures (Fig. 5E).\nPlastic intrusions are caused by fluidification of sediments and rising of plastic material, mainly through hydraulic fractures without clear orientation patterns (Montenat et al., 2007; Moretti and van Loon, 2014); however, in CU intrusions proceed through tectonic fractures, which supports that earthquakes are the triggering mechanism for this structure.\n\n\n4.3.7\nNeptunian dikes\nDikes are developed along joints or normal synsedimentary small faults (Fig. 9A\u2013C). Locally, a plastic intrusion at the lower part of a gypsum bed is connected upwards with a Neptunian dike by the same fracture, this forming gypsum boulders and blocks (Fig. 9B, E).\nNeptunian dikes form by introduction of material, either under pressure or by simple filling of pre-existing cracks or fissures from above (Montenat et al., 2007). This type of structure indicates brittle failure of cohesive or semi-lithified sediments that potentially can be triggered by different mechanisms, including desiccation cracks, seismic shocks and dehydration and hydration processes of Ca-sulfates. Multiple sediment infills, as observed in Miocene gypsum, indicate that the same sediments were affected by two or more deformation events at different stages of early diagenesis (Montenat et al., 2007; T\u00f6r\u0151 and Pratt, 2016). The association of this structure with synsedimentary faults and plastic intrusions suggests that they were produced by seismic shakes; although their formation could be facilitated from previous structures such as mudcracks or, just the opposite, desiccation cracks developed preferentially along fractures induced by earthquakes.\n\n\n4.3.8\nMicrostructures: stylolites and deformed gypsum crystals\nMicroscope studies evidence the presence of microstylolites in HV rock and deformation of gypsum crystals in CU. Three main types of deformation of crystals have been detected: folding, displacement of planes and cracking of crystals, along the (010) main cleavage (Figs. 6E, 7C).\nIt is accepted that stylolites parallel or horizontal with respect to bedding plane are produced by the pressure generated by overlying rocks during burial (Toussaint et al., 2018). Although there have been many studies on Miocene lacustrine deposits of the Madrid Basin, this is the first-time that stylolites have been reported. This would be because the thickness of overburden rocks in the study successions (<80\u202fm) is not enough to produce such structures. Along these lines, Montenat et al. (2007) and Seilacher (1969, 1984) suggested that earthquakes can produce a sudden increase in compaction without an effect of overloading. Accordingly, accommodation to compaction strain during seismic shocks seems the most plausible mechanism for the formation of the microstylolites and the deformation of gypsum crystals in the study successions. In this way, it is interpreted that gypsum crystals deformed differently depending on the orientation of the crystals and their (010) cleavage. If the vertical stress was parallel to cleavage, the fragments moved along such planes without separating (Fig. 6E). Alternatively, when stress was oblique, crystals broke, and their fragments separated (Fig. 6E). The type of deformation as well as the different orientations and specific location of the fragmented crystals in Miocene beds allow discarding reworking and mineral replacements. Such mechanisms were adduced by Aref and Mannaa (2021) as the responsible for the fragmentation of crystals in sabkhas.\n\n\n4.3.9\nMud\/sand volcanoes\nA group of mud\/sand volcanoes is uniquely exposed in three dimensions in Cu\u00e9llar succession, which allowed visualizing the surficial and internal structures of these edifices (Figs. 3, 11) as well as their alignment, along fracture directions (Fig. 11B). They occur associated to mat flakes and gas tubes (Fig. 11E, F). In cross-section, layers around the vent tilt steeply downwards (Fig. 11C, D). Vertical and subvertical pipes up to 6\u202fcm long, connect the central plug of the volcanoes with an underlying bed showing convolute lamination that appeared as the source of the ejected sediment (Fig. 11C, D). The main conducts occur at fracture intersections surrounded by several secondary tubes (Fig. 11B, D). Observations of the pipes infilling under a light microscope reveal that ejected gypsum crystals and dolomite matrix are crossed by oriented micro-cracks and micro-tubes (Fig. 6H, I).\nMud volcanoes typically occur where stratified rocks with an abundance of water-saturated sediment, commonly consisting of uncemented mud and sand, are under pressure from overlying strata. The cones form as the fluidized sediment is extruded through a vent at the sediment surface (Montenat et al., 2007; Moretti and van Loon, 2014; Taj et al., 2014). In the Miocene rocks it has been shown that the overpressured sediment was comprised of an uncommon mixture of dolomite and gypsum. As in many other sedimentary volcanoes, the fluidized mixture intruded the overlying bed through fractures acting as preferentially conduits (Montenat et al., 2007; Moretti and van Loon, 2014). Tides, storms and seismic shocks cause the release of pressure from a liquified unit (Shanmugam, 2017). The carbonatic lithology of the edifices and the occurrence of mat flakes provide evidence of microbial mats on the upper surface of the bed. The impermeable and cohesive surface of the mats is reported to trap gases that increase the pore pressure and can destabilize the underlying sediment (Montague et al., 1993). The fragmentation of the microbial layer and sudden exposure of bubble-separated sediment trigger water-saturated injection of sediment (Taj et al., 2014). A similar effect of gas blistering and destabilization of sediment due to the fragmentation of microbial mats following storm events has been reported in modern lakes where gypsum microbialites are forming (Sanz-Montero and Rodr\u00edguez-Aranda, 2013; Sanz-Montero et al., 2015). Albeit in many ancient microbialites it may be difficult to discriminate between microbial and seismic structures (Moretti and van Loon, 2014), in Cu\u00e9llar a range of features provide criteria to interpret this structure as seismites, among others, the association of volcanoes with other deformation structures and the preservation of the central pipe linking the surface with a deeper source. At microscale, the net of fractures and pores also provides evidence of a seismic shock. Besides, the preferred orientation of gypsum crystals along the pipes reveals main flow directions (Fig. 6H, E).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nMiocene lacustrine gypsum rocks of Madrid and Duero basins contain a remarkable record of biosignatures and microbially induced sedimentary structures. These structures indicate variable sedimentary conditions that are interpreted to range from calm submerged environments, where intrasedimentary gypsum grows, to stormy situations reflected by cross stratification. Besides, this study provides the first evidence of deformation structures indicative of earthquakes in microbial gypsum deposits. The distribution of seismites in two separated sequences gives accurate insight into the seismogenic behavior of the gypsum microbial sediments and faults in areas devoid of silt to sand sized siliciclastic deposits.\n\n5.1\nMicrobialite development in shallow hypersaline lakes and preservation\nReports of modern and shallow hypersaline settings show that gypsum grows within microbial mats forming laminated deposits (Ort\u00ed et al., 1984; Gerdes et al., 2000; Rouchy and Monty, 2000; Sanz-Montero et al., 2013; Cabestrero et al., 2018; Del Buey et al., 2021). The morphology of these deposits is commonly altered and the microbial fossils rarely preserved in the geological record that may make their interpretation difficult (Gerdes et al., 2000; Rouchy and Monty, 2000). Albeit, this study based on a comparison of Miocene gypsum successions and modern analogs, particularly those found in the shallow hypersaline lakes of center Spain, reveals that a suite of mineralogical and chemical biosignatures as well as microbial induced sedimentary structures can be preserved in gypsum rocks. Combining such attributes allowed the reliable identification of Miocene gypsum beds as microbialites. Among the mineralogical biosignatures, it is remarkable the preservation of intrasediment-grown lenticular gypsum crystals associated to organic matrix and inclusions (Ort\u00ed et al., 1984; Rouchy and Monty, 2000; Del Buey et al., 2021). Besides, the mineralogical assemblages of Miocene rocks comprised of gypsum, dolomite, celestite, Mg-clays and ankerite are quite similar in modern sedimentary environments, where the precipitation of each of these minerals has been reported to be related with bacterial activities (Rouchy and Monty, 2000; Sanz-Montero et al., 2008, 2013; Petrash et al., 2012; Cabestrero and Sanz-Montero, 2018; Del Buey et al., 2018, 2021). Regardless of the mechanisms for their formations, the progressive precipitation of minerals causes the early lithification of the microbial mats and, thus, favors their preservation in the fossil record. Notably, laminae mineralized in carbonates, which appear with continuous and undulated surface morphologies, show higher lithification and rigidity degrees than gypsum beds. These different physical properties may explain the distinct behavior of each type of sediment upon deformation. Direct observation of the interplay between gypsiferous sediments and wind-driven currents in shallow lakes, showed that currents were sufficient to erode away the microbial mats producing mat fragments, abraded crystals, scours and ripple forms, among other structures (Sanz-Montero and Rodr\u00edguez-Aranda, 2013; Sanz-Montero et al., 2015). The abundance of cross bedding structures in gypsum strata highlights the crucial role of the hydrodynamic conditions induced by episodic storms had on the sediment accumulation in the Miocene lakes of central Spain. As in siliciclastic deposits (Noffke, 2010), it has been observed that organic mud drapes infill the ripple troughs in the saline lakes (Sanz-Montero et al., 2015). The accumulation of drapes together with the rapid recolonizing of the bedforms conducts surface leveling (Noffke et al., 2001) as well as the biostabilization and the persistence of structures in the sedimentary environments (Cuadrado et al., 2011). The good preservation of the sedimentary forms in Miocene gypsum deposits of the two study successions suggests that biostabilization may enhance the potential of preservation of gypsum beds that would otherwise have been easily eroded away.\n\n\n5.2\nSSDSs and brittle structures interpreted as seismites\nA wide range of sedimentary deformation structures are found in the Miocene gypsiferous deposits: load casts, pillows, dish structures, convolute bedding and lamination, plastic intrusions, fluid escape tubes, mud\/sand volcanoes, horizontal microstylolites, Neptunian dikes and fractures. These structures reflect ductile and brittle (microfractures) deformation or a combination of both types. The latter applies for plastic intrusions associated to the formation of Neptunian dikes and fractures, which occur either simultaneously or during successive deformational stages (van Loon, 2009).\nAccording to Shanmugam (2016), liquefaction can be induced by many triggering mechanisms besides earthquakes. In the study cases most of such mechanisms can be ruled out easily based on the abundance of horizontally bedded primary gypsums, the wide lateral extent of deformations (Moretti and van Loon, 2014; Shanmugam, 2016), the shallow condition of the lacustrine settings, the lack of evidence of depositional slopes, the shallow burial diagenesis and the geographical and temporal separation between the two sedimentary successions. Care has been taken to interpret ductile deformation features as seismites, where there are other potential candidates for forming them. Thereby, the preferential location of the Miocene sand volcanoes at the intersection of fractures in the CU area suggests a seismic trigger to the detriment of accumulation of gases in the microbial mats, as reported by Taj et al. (2014). Similarly, load cast and pillow structures tend to follow specific directions in HV. Besides, convolute bedding and lamination structures could be caused by storm episodes (Alfaro et al., 2002), but in Miocene rocks these features occur associated with brittle deformation structures, which gives criteria for interpreting them as seismites.\nThe distribution of the outcrops along NW\u2013SE trending fault systems (Fig. 1B) that were tectonically active during the sedimentation of the gypsum deposits provides a key and additional indicator of potential seismic shocks. Active strike-slip faults in the region reflect Variscan fractures reactivated during the Alpine orogeny (De Vicente et al., 2011). Along the same lines, the occurrence of an overlying interval of gently dipping beds that laterally disappear in CU points to synsedimentary tectonic activity (e.g., Montenat et al., 2007) and reveals a substantial change in the type of sediment infill. In HV the abrupt accumulation of mudstone over gypsum deposits also indicates tectonic-driven changes in the depositional setting. So, these results point out the dominant role of tectonic-driven changes in saline lakes devoid of fossils other than microbes.\nBesides, gypsum beds show distinctive microstructural features such as horizontal microstylolites and cracked gypsum crystals that provide a new type of evidence for synsedimentary tectonic activity in gypsum deposits. The vertical orientation of gypsum lenses in the sand volcanoes and Neptunian dike infills is another microstructural tool for identifying injection of material under pressure in ancient rocks. Infilling by vertically oriented lenses in dikes is different from bioturbation traces typically found in ancient and modern gypsiferous lakes (Rodr\u00edguez-Aranda and Calvo, 1998; Sanz-Montero et al., 2013). In gypsum lakes, extensive bioturbation is mainly caused by invertebrates and produces distinctive meniscate back-filled tubes arranged in all directions that aid in their recognition (Rodr\u00edguez-Aranda and Calvo, 1998; Sanz-Montero et al., 2013).\nThus, a combination of lithologic, sedimentary, stratigraphic and micro to macro structural criteria allows interpreting SSDSs and brittle structures as seismites. Many reports document the occurrence of seismites in siliciclastic sediments associated with microbialites deposited in different sedimentary conditions (Eriksson and Truswell, 1974; Alvaro et al., 2006; van Loon et al., 2016). As far as we know, this study provides the first example of deformation structures affecting a mix of lithologies dominated by primary gypsum sediments deposited in shallow saline lakes and gives insight into the high susceptibility of intrasediment-grown gypsum deposits to liquefaction. According to the study of mechanical behavior of silt sized gypsum sediments in modern saline lakes conducted by Pulmari\u00f1o et al. (2019), gypsum sediments display higher cohesion properties than fine sized siliciclastic sediments. The research also demonstrated that cohesion of gypsum deposits changes very little with the moisture contents. The lenticular morphology of gypsum crystals offering higher resistance to particle separation could be behind this behavior (Pulmari\u00f1o et al., 2019). Such results suggest that gypsum sediments may be less susceptible to liquefaction than weakly consolidated siliciclastic grains. Therefore, they would need larger magnitude earthquakes to form. Mart\u00edn-Banda et al. (2008) reported siliciclastic deposits showing syndepositional deformation structures (load casts, pillows and convolute bedding) associated to the E\u2013W trending faults in the southern border of the Madrid Basin (Fig. 1). Distant 30\u202fkm from HV, such structures are slightly older (Miocene Lower Unit) and of relatively larger scale (meter scale) than the ones formed in the studied gypsum facies.\nIt is assumed that seismic shocks that affect several tens of kilometers from the epicenter, as in the study areas, had a moderate-to high-magnitude (Moretti and van Loon, 2014; Shanmugam, 2016). Along the same terms, Rodr\u00edguez-Pascua et al. (2000) and Montenat et al. (2007) suggested that the threshold for seismically-induced liquefaction corresponds to a magnitude over 5, though depending on the attributes of the affected sediments. Synsedimentary brittle structures indicate that the lithification degree of sediments was varied in the study areas upon deformation. Plastic intrusions (Figs. 4C, 8C, E) and lenticular gypsum crystals arranged parallel to the fracture surface (Fig. 6G) reveal unconsolidated ground, but Neptunian dikes and microfaults (Fig. 8A, B) are typical of more compacted sediments (Montenat et al., 2007). The degree of lithification of the rocks is useful to assign the intensity of an earthquake using the Modified Mercalli Scale. It is estimated that fractures in lithified rocks, like in cemented gypsum and dolomite laminae, are produced by earthquakes with intensities above VIII (Michetti et al., 2007; Silva and Rodr\u00edguez-Pascua, 2014).\nIn sedimentary environments it is difficult to specify the number of seismic shocks because their effects can reach several meters deep and a single earthquake can produce superposed deformed beds (Montenat et al., 2007; Alfaro et al., 2010; Gibert et al., 2011), though the pattern of distribution of deformed layers through the Miocene successions points to close shocks (Bose et al., 1997; Owen, 1996; Seilacher, 1984). As inferred from differences in the number and typology of seismites between the two areas, earthquakes were stronger and less frequent in HV than in CU (Figs. 2, 3). The larger magnitude and lower recurrence periods of earthquakes recorded in HV with respect to CU could be related with discontinuous fault movements and longer periods of strain accumulation in the fracture plane.\nThese results reveal the dominant role of tectonic-driven changes may have in saline lake sedimentation. In addition, results help to understanding the seismogenic behavior of both gypsarenites and faults in areas devoid of siliciclastic deposits during successive deformational stages.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe study of two Miocene sedimentary successions in the Duero and Madrid Basins reveals that a suite of microbial induced sedimentary structures (MISS) can be finely preserved in lacustrine deposits comprising sandy gypsum crystals. The MISS identified in the two separated successions, such as ripple leveling, mat clasts, and others, provide ancient analogs for modern gypsum microbialites formed in saline and shallow lakes, subjected to periodic storm influence. The rapid mineralization of the microbial mats and biostabilization processes may play a role in the good preservation of the depositional structures in sulfates that would otherwise have been altered or vanished.\nBesides, the successions show large-scale deformation structures (SSDSs and fractures), reflecting ductile and brittle deformation. The combination and spatial distribution of these structures nearby active strike-slip faults allow interpreting deformation features as true seismites. Those identified in the Duero Basin include small fractures, load casts, pillows, dish structures, convolute bedding and lamination, plastic intrusions, fluid escape tubes and mud\/sand volcanoes. The latter is absent in the Madrid Basin, by contrast, this succession shows Neptunian dikes and horizontal microstylolites. The difference of types and higher vertical repetition of deformation structures in the Duero Basin than in the Madrid Basin suggest that earthquakes were stronger and less frequent in the latter.\nThe abundance of SSDSs in the two successions gives evidence that gypsum microbial sediments are highly prone to earthquakes. Thus, the vertical distribution of the deformation structures provides a good record of the seismogenic behavior of faults. The association of MISS and SSDSs gives unique information for understanding the evolution and paleoenvironmental conditions of saline lakes and their basins.\n\n","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nReliable probabilistic seismic hazard assessment relies on thorough knowledge about the occurrence and shaking strength (e.g. peak ground acceleration (PGA), seismic intensity) of past earthquakes. Subaqueous paleoseismology aims to expand historic earthquake catalogues by studying long lacustrine and marine sedimentary sequences for imprints of past earthquakes (e.g. Goldfinger et al., 2012; Ikehara et al., 2016; Kremer et al., 2017; Moernaut et al., 2018). Earthquake-induced soft sediment deformation structures (SSDS) are a common paleoseismic indicator within these subaqueous records (e.g. Sims, 1973; Hibsch et al., 1997; Agnon et al., 2006; Ojala et al., 2019; Oswald et al., 2021). Several deformation mechanisms can create earthquake-triggered SSDS, for example, liquefaction, fluidization (e.g. Owen and Moretti, 2011) or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability between sediment layers induced by earthquake-related shear (e.g. Heifetz et al., 2005). In the Dead Sea Basin, SSDS related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability were used to reconstruct seismic recurrence rates and magnitudes from a single basin core in stably-stratified sediment comprised of a single lithotype (i.e. alternating laminations of aragonite and detritus; Lu et al., 2020).\nEarthquake-related shear can induce deformation in sedimentary sequences by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The SSDS related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability have been described in contemporaneous lacustrine and marine sedimentary sequences (e.g. Sakaguchi et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2020; Molenaar et al., 2021) and in outcrops (e.g. Rodr\u00edguez-Pascua et al., 2000; Alsop and Marco, 2011; Mugnier et al., 2011). Numerical models show that the degree of deformation of SSDS related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability evolves with increasing PGA from disturbed lamination, to folds (asymmetric billows and coherent vortices) and finally intraclast breccia (Wetzler et al., 2010). During seismic shaking, the shear seismic energy might overcome the gravitational potential energy of stably stratified sediments causing layers with small differences in densities to move with different velocities, thereby inducing shear at layer interfaces leading to deformation (Heifetz et al., 2005; Wetzler et al., 2010). The gravitational potential energy is lower for thinner layers of a given density making shear seismic energy more effective (i.e. termed shear seismic energy density by Wetzler et al. (2010) and used in this study from now on) and deformation by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability more efficient in thinner deforming sequences despite the larger viscosity of thinner layer. Therefore, both deformation degree and thickness of the deformed horizon (termed deformation thickness from now on) are important input data when quantifying seismic shaking strength (i.e. PGA) of past earthquakes based on SSDS characteristics (Lu et al., 2020). However, the modulating effect of lithology and slope angle (e.g. Spalluto et al., 2007; Alfaro et al., 2010; Alsop et al., 2016; Molenaar et al., 2021) on the deformation thickness and degree (Fig. 1\n) of SSDS related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability remains poorly studied.\nSediment characteristics affect mechanical properties of sediments and thereby propensity to deformation. Especially relevant are abrupt changes in mechanical properties, such as shear strength, density, viscosity or cohesion (e.g. Alsop and Marco, 2011; T\u00f6r\u0151 and Pratt, 2016; Wiemer et al., 2017). Clastic layers can serve as basal shear surface during seismic loading, by strength reduction accumulating strain above or within them (e.g. Gatter et al., 2021). While lithology controls the mechanical properties of the sediments, slope angle and seismic ground motion directly alter the gravitational or seismically-induced shear stress they undergo. Higher gravitational downslope stress\u2014related to steeper slope angles\u2014is found to increase deformation thickness in numerical experiments (e.g. Biscontin and Pestana, 2006; Zhou et al., 2017) and in a lacustrine case study (Molenaar et al., 2021). Higher earthquake-induced shear stress (e.g. higher PGA) can increase deformation degree and potentially thickness as shown by numerical models (e.g. Lu et al., 2020) and empirically in a natural settings (Molenaar et al., 2021), respectively. Lithology can vary both downcore (i.e. over time) and per site and slope angle can differ per site. No systematic studies exist that investigate the interplay of all three factors\u2014lithology, slope angle and shaking strength\u2014in natural conditions, although such studies would be essential to allow quantitative paleoseismology at different sites and settings.\nWe choose lake Ri\u00f1ihue in south-central Chile (Fig. 2\n) as ideal natural laboratory for investigating how i) lithology, ii) slope angle and iii) seismic shaking strength simultaneously modulate deformation thickness and deformation degree. At lake Ri\u00f1ihue, sediment composition varies downcore and volcanogenic deposits (fine- and coarse-grained) are abundant (e.g. Moernaut et al., 2014). Previous research reported SSDS on 16 different slope sites linked to a well-constrained basinal turbidite paleoseismic record that represents one prehistorical and five historical megathrust earthquake with varying shaking strength at the lake (Molenaar et al., 2021). Based on new lithological data, we evaluate how volcanogenic deposits and sediment composition affect deformation degree and thickness. Based on data presented by Molenaar et al. (2021), we assess the influence of slope angle and shaking strength on deformation degree and thickness of individual SSDS. Finally, we integrate our observations and evaluate the relative importance of all three factors for surficial deformation to push forward the field of quantitative paleoseismology by advancing our understanding of deformation using data from a natural setting.\n\n\n2\nSetting\n\n2.1\nSeismotectonic setting and earthquake history\nLake Ri\u00f1ihue is located at 39.8\u00b0S 72.4\u00b0W, south-central Chile, along the Valdivia Segment of the Chilean subduction zone (Fig. 2), where the Nazca Plate subducts below the South American Plate with a convergence rate of ~7.4\u202fcm a\u22121 (DeMets et al., 2010).\nThe Mw 9.5 1960\u202fCE earthquake fully ruptured the Valdivia Segment along a length of about 1000\u202fkm with maximum coseismic slip of about 40\u202fm (Moreno et al., 2009) and is the strongest instrumentally recorded earthquake. Historical documents reveal three other strong megathrust earthquakes on the Valdivia Segment in 1837\u202fCE, 1737\u202fCE and 1575\u202fCE (Lomnitz, 2004; Cisternas et al., 2005). Furthermore, a prehistorical earthquake ruptured part of the Valdivia Segment in 1466\u202f\u00b1\u202f4\u202fCE as inferred from seismoturbidite records of lakes Ri\u00f1ihue and Calafqu\u00e9n, another piedmont lake in the region (Moernaut et al., 2014). Historical reports and geological evidence for the 1575\u202fCE earthquake is highly similar to that of the 1960\u202fCE earthquake and therefore these are considered generally comparable in size and rupture area. Both events triggered large landslides blocking the San Pedro River (Davis and Karzulov\u00edc, 1963), were accompanied with similar tsunami effects in Chile (Cisternas et al., 2005), resulted in comparable turbidite distribution in lakes at the foot of the Andes and both Ays\u00e9n and Reloncav\u00ed fjords (St-Onge et al., 2012; Moernaut et al., 2014; Wils et al., 2020), and showed a similar distribution of coastal subsidence (Cisternas et al., 2005, 2017b). The 1837\u202fCE and 1737\u202fCE earthquakes are attributed to partial ruptures of the Valdivia Segment with lower magnitudes than the 1960\u202fCE and 1575\u202fCE earthquakes. For the 1837\u202fCE earthquake, previous research proposed a magnitude range of Mw 8.8\u20139.2 and a wide rupture along the southern half of the Valdivia Segment (Abe, 1979; Cisternas et al., 2017a). This magnitude range is based on historical reports, coseismic land-level change distribution and reported height of the transpacific tsunami at the Japanese coast (Lomnitz, 1970; Abe, 1979; Cisternas et al., 2017a). The 1737\u202fCE earthquake is attributed to a rupture along the northern third of the Valdivia Segment with a magnitude in the range of Mw 7.5\u20138.2 based on extent of destruction in historical reports and turbidite distribution in piedmont lakes (Lomnitz, 2004; Moernaut et al., 2014; Cisternas et al., 2017a). Recent evidence of tsunami inundation and coastal subsidence assigned the 1737\u202fCE earthquake to a shallow local rupture (Hocking et al., 2021). The prehistorical ~1466\u202fCE earthquake was tentatively linked to a similar rupture extent and magnitude as the 1737\u202fCE earthquake, based on a similar turbidite distribution for the two earthquakes within the piedmont lakes (Moernaut et al., 2014).\nAverage estimated PGAs at lake Ri\u00f1ihue are ~0.57\u202fg for the strongest 1960 and 1575\u202fCE earthquakes, ~0.27\u202fg for the more southern 1837\u202fCE earthquake and ~0.29\u202fg for the 1737 and ~1466 CE earthquakes directly west of the study site (Molenaar et al., 2021). These PGA estimates were calculated using empirical ground motion prediction equations developed for the Chilean subduction zone (Idini et al., 2017) using magnitudes and shortest distances to the rupture area of each megathrust earthquake as input values. For the megathrust earthquakes preceding 1960\u202fCE, the magnitude and rupture area locations were estimated based on aforementioned geological and historical evidence. Given the uncertainties in this approach, these average PGAs should be considered as first-order estimates and are used solely for relative comparison of shaking strength at the lake for the main earthquakes. Recurrence rates\u2014based on seismoturbidite records from piedmont lakes\u2014are calculated as ~292\u202fyears for earthquakes that caused strongest shaking at the lake with a macroseismic intensity \u2265VII1\/2 (e.g. 1960 and 1575\u202fCE) and ~139\u202fyears for earthquakes that caused less strong shaking with a macroseismic intensity \u2265VI1\/2 (e.g. 1837\u202fCE, 1737\u202fCE and ~1466\u202fCE; Moernaut et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n2.2\nLake setting, sediment composition and earthquake-triggered sedimentary imprint\nLake Ri\u00f1ihue is a glacigenic piedmont lake located at the foot of the Andes with a size of 28\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u20135\u202fkm and a maximum depth of 323\u202fm (Fig. 2). The lake is oligotrophic and monomictic with overturn during winter and a thermocline developing from ~20 to ~40\u202fm depth from late spring to autumn and a sedimentation rate of ~1\u202fmm\/a during the Middle to Late Holocene (Campos, 1984; Campos et al., 2001; Moernaut et al., 2014, 2018). The active Mocho-Choshuenco Volcano is located east of the lake (Fig. S1). Sediment cores were taken in the southwestern basin, which is sheltered from major lahar or river inflows to avoid erosion by coarse-grained fractions of lahars or flood-related hyperpycnal flows. Sixteen slope sediment cores were investigated from sites with slope angles of ~0.6\u00b0 to ~4.9\u00b0 and one basin-floor core where the slope angle is ~0.2\u00b0.\nBackground sediments consist of biogenic varves made up by mm-scale laminations of diatom ooze related to diatom blooms during summer and clay to silt-sized terrigenous material linked to increased run-off during winter (Moernaut et al., 2014; Van Daele et al., 2015; Molenaar et al., 2021). Destructive forest exploitation around lake Ri\u00f1ihue in the first half of the 20th Century lead to increased organic matter content (Donoso and Lara, 1996; Moernaut et al., 2017) in the upper part of the sedimentary sequence (Fig. S2). Two types of volcanogenic deposits (up to 1\u202fcm thick) are intercalated in these background sediments: i) fine-grained lahar deposits caused by eruptions of Mocho-Choshuenco Volcano east of the lake and mainly transported to the core sites by over- or interflows (Van Daele et al., 2014; Molenaar et al., 2021) and ii) black coarse-grained tephra air-fall deposits (Fig. S2). Varve counting and tephrochronology supported by excess210Pb and 137Cs dating were used to accurately date the sedimentary sequence of our studied basin (Moernaut et al., 2014, 2017).\nThree types of earthquake-related deposits have been described in the sedimentary sequence of lake Ri\u00f1ihue (Fig. S2): i) turbidites in the basin sedimentary sequences; ii) centimeter-scale stratigraphic gaps related to surficial remobilization in slope sedimentary sequences; and iii) SSDS in both basin and slope sedimentary sequences (Moernaut et al., 2014; Van Daele et al., 2015; Molenaar et al., 2021). Earthquake-triggered turbidites in the southwestern basin correlated to all five strong historical megathrust earthquakes and the prehistorical ~1466\u202fCE earthquake. Thin earthquake-related turbidites (~1\u202fcm) were observed at some slope sites (Fig. S2). Erosion by fine-grained turbidity currents in the distal portion of the flat basin is negligible as observed by core correlation (Molenaar et al., 2021). Surficial remobilization is the main earthquake-induced sediment remobilization process responsible for turbidite formation in lake Ri\u00f1ihue (Moernaut et al., 2017; Molenaar et al., 2021). Surficial remobilization involves remolding of the uppermost centimeters of slope sediments by seismic shaking followed by downslope transportation (e.g. McHugh et al., 2016; Moernaut et al., 2017). Centimeter-scale stratigraphic gaps are caused by surficial remobilization and were detected on several slope sites from a minimum slope angle of ~2.3\u00b0 (Molenaar et al., 2021).\nMost SSDS in lake Ri\u00f1ihue (i.e. 68\u202f%) are stratigraphically linked to one of the six megathrust earthquakes. An SSDS was assigned to an earthquake trigger if the top of the SSDS interval correlated within 2\u202fcm below the stratigraphic level of one of the six megathrust earthquakes (Molenaar et al., 2021). An SSDS interval directly below a gap related to surficial remobilization was linked to the earthquake that caused the gap. The SSDS intervals (i.e. 32\u202f%) that did not stratigraphically correlate to any of the main documented earthquakes were proposed to be i) formed by local smaller earthquakes (that did not cause stratigraphic gaps by surficial remobilization or generate turbidites) or ii) formed deeper in the sedimentary sequence during one of the six megathrust earthquakes through dewatering of volcanogenic deposits and subsequent weakening of overlying sediment (Molenaar et al., 2021). Therefore, the age of these SSDS could not be determined through stratigraphic correlation and they were not linked to any of the six megathrust earthquakes. Three types of SSDS related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability were identified at lake Ri\u00f1ihue: i) disturbed lamination, ii) folds and iii) intraclast breccia (Fig. 3\n). For disturbed lamination and folds, individual laminations are still intact, and the deformation of these laminations ranges from undulation to folding with a clear vergence, respectively. For intraclast breccias, the deformed sediment is mixed, partly homogenized and can comprise clasts of laminations. Molenaar et al. (2021) also identified other types of SSDS within lake Ri\u00f1ihue, such as i) faults, ii) load structures and iii) injection structures, but these only occurred five times and are not related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and therefore not the focus of this study.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\nThe research strategy and origin of the different datasets used to evaluate the effect of i) lithology, ii) slope angle and iii) seismic shaking strength are outlined in the flowchart on Fig. 4\n and described in more detail in Section 3.1.\n\n3.1\nLinking SSDS to the seismo-turbidite record and sediment composition\nDeformation characteristics of each SSDS\u2014thickness and deformation degree\u2014were mapped on slope and basin sequences (Fig. 4a). Also, the slope angle for each site was determined. Next, SSDS were correlated to an accurately-dated basinal seismoturbidite record to evaluate whether they stratigraphically linked to one of the six megathrust earthquakes and to derive shaking strength (i.e. PGA; Fig. 4b). Molenaar et al. (2021) already presented these two steps.\nData on sediment composition from a basinal reference core are projected onto individual SSDS within slope cores (Fig. 4c). Lithology and sedimentation rate are highly similar at our selected slope and basin sites (Molenaar et al., 2021), thereby justifying projection of sediment composition data from basin to slope cores. Projected data on sediment composition are averaged from all data points in a SSDS to obtain a single value: average D50 for grainsize, average biogenic opal content (representing diatom content) and average organic matter content. If no data point is available for a specific SSDS (e.g. too thin SSDS compared to sampling resolution), a value from a similar lithology is selected. The median radiodensity was measured for each CT slice within the SSDS itself and averaged to obtain mean radiodensity. We distinguish between SSDS intervals and SSDS types as a single SSDS interval can contain several SSDS types. To enable us to evaluate potential correlations between sediment composition and deformation degree of SSDS, the deformation degree was transformed into an ordinal variable ranking from disturbed lamination (1) to folds (2) and finally intraclast breccia (3). This was considered valid as these three types of SSDS reflect increasing deformation degree (e.g. Wetzler et al., 2010). Spearman's correlation (i.e. measuring strength and direction for a monotonic association between two variables) was used to evaluate strength and direction of possible association between variables without making assumptions on data distribution. Furthermore, to analyze the role of volcanogenic deposits on deformation, we identify if the basal layer is a volcanogenic deposit and if it is incorporated into the SSDS.\n\n\n3.2\nSediment core analyses\nSediment cores were taken in 2017 (all slope cores) and 2015 (CRIN8) using a percussion-driven gravity corer (UWITEC, Austria). Slope angles of study sites were determined using multibeam bathymetric maps also acquired in 2017. Bathymetry, all core images, X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic susceptibility were presented in Molenaar et al. (2021). Undrained shear strength (Su), grain-size data, XRF-scanning chemical element profiles and biogenic opal content were all measured on basin core CRIN8. Directly upon opening, Su was measured by fall cone penetrometer measurements using a cone with a defined weight of 79.8\u202fg, opening angle of 30\u00b0 and cone factor of 0.85 (Wood, 1985). Grain-size data were obtained using laser diffraction with a Malvern Mastersizer 3000 after 1\u202fmin ultrasonification at 5\u202f% to ensure breaking apart of agglomerates while causing minimal breakage of diatom frustules. Grain-size distribution statistics were calculated with the GRADISTAT software (Blott and Pye, 2001) using the Folk and Ward (1957) method. An ITRAX XRF core scanner of the Austrian Core Facility (University of Innsbruck, Austria) was used to measure chemical element profiles. Measurements were taken at 0.2\u202fmm resolution, with a Mo X-ray tube setting of 30\u202fkV, 45\u202fmA and an exposure time of 5\u202fs. All resulting XRF spectra were reevaluated by the Q-Spec software (version 8.6.0) provided by COX\u00ae Analytical Systems to calculate elemental peak areas into counts. Biogenic opal analysis was conducted through alkaline extraction using NaOH after dissolving organic matter and carbonate material (Mortlock and Froelich, 1989; Carter and Colman, 1994) and subsequent measurement of Si and Al (proportionate to the detrital fraction of Si) on a Horiba Jobin Yvon ICP-OES. Biogenic opal (SiO2\u2022nH2O) was calculated by biogenic silica concentration\u20222.4 (Mortlock and Froelich, 1989) to account for the average water content of diatoms. Organic matter content was measured on core RINCG03 at Ghent University by loss-on-ignition (LOI; 4\u202fh at 550\u202f\u00b0C) after drying of samples for 24\u202fh at 105\u202f\u00b0C as described by Moernaut et al. (2017).\n\n\n3.3\nData transformation and K-means cluster analysis\nThe chemical elements used were Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Sr as well as the incoherent to coherent scattering ratio (inc\/coh) based on their good reproducibility (i.e. r2\u202f>\u202f0.6) on duplicate XRF scans of the same core (L\u00f6wemark et al., 2019). Measurements of zero values give infinite values when taking the logarithm and are therefore removed from our analysis (e.g. Lee et al., 2019; Peti et al., 2019). Raw data of chemical elements were corrected using the centered-log ratio (clr) transformation to avoid bias by matrix and closed-sum effects (e.g. Weltje et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2019; Schwestermann et al., 2020). The inc\/coh relies on the ratio between light and heavy elements, respectively, and therefore represents average atomic mass of the sediment. Commonly, high inc\/coh relates to increased organic matter and\/or water content of sediment (e.g. Croudace et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2016). Before K-means cluster analysis, the data mean of each variable was rescaled to 0 and standard deviation set to 1 (i.e. standardization) to avoid bias by higher magnitude variables. Therefore, within the standardized data, positive and negative values relate to higher and lower than average data values, respectively. Based on the Elbow method and visual evaluation of different cluster numbers with the sedimentary sequence, six clusters were chosen (Fig. S3). Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted after K-means clustering to evaluate contribution of each studied element to the six clusters.\nWe projected the six XRF-derived clusters onto sediment composition data (i.e. magnetic susceptibility, biogenic opal content, radiodensity and organic matter content) to evaluate differences between clusters in terms of sediment composition. A single sediment composition data point can include multiple XRF-derived clusters, especially when the deviation between sediment-composition sampling resolution and that of the XRF-derived cluster data is large (e.g. 10\u202fmm for biogenic opal content versus 0.2\u202fmm for XRF data). To account for this problem, we assigned a sediment-composition data point to the most abundant cluster in its sampling range. Also, note that we projected the organic matter content from core RINCG03 on core CRIN8.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nLithologies\nPrincipal components (PC) 1 and 2 account for 39.5\u202f% and 24.9\u202f% of total variance within our XRF dataset, respectively (Fig. 5b). PC 1 has high positive loading of inc\/coh, Mn and Si and PC2 of Fe, K and Ti.\nCluster 5 and 6 (purple and green) have highest PC1 score and coincide with highest average biogenic opal content (average 41\u202fwt% and 47\u202fwt%; Fig. 5c) as well as lowest average radiodensity (243 and 314 HU) and magnetic susceptibility (75\u202f\u2217\u202f10\u22125 and 112\u202f\u2217\u202f10\u22125 SI). Cluster 5 (purple) also has highest average organic matter content with 14\u202fwt%. Cluster 4 (red) has the lowest PC1 score and corresponds to the lowest average biogenic opal and organic matter content (i.e. 33\u202fwt% and 7\u202fwt%, respectively) and highest average radiodensity (532 HU) and magnetic susceptibility (203\u202f\u2217\u202f10\u22125 SI). In terms of PC score, average biogenic opal content, radiodensity and magnetic susceptibility, clusters 1, 2 and 3 (yellow, blue and orange) are in between clusters 4 (red) versus clusters 5 and 6 (purple and green).\nThe tephra and lahar deposits all correspond to cluster 4 (red) a higher magnetic susceptibility. The lahar deposit directly above and below the ~1466\u202fCE earthquake is the only exception as this one correlates to cluster 1 (yellow). The grain-size distribution of cluster 4 (red) is at its coarsest and finest when corresponding to tephra-fall and lahar deposits, respectively (Fig. 5a and d). Clastic mm-scale laminations intercalated within background sediment also correspond to cluster 4 (red), but no increase in magnetic susceptibility can be discerned compared to background sediment. The grain size of the clastic mm-scale laminations of cluster 4 (red) is finer than that of clusters linked to background sediment (e.g. cluster 2 and 6 (blue and green) as examples within Fig. 5d), as it has higher contribution of clay to fine silt. In contrast, background sediment clusters mainly consist of coarse to very coarse silts. Based on these observations, we consider all occurrences of cluster 4 (red) as some type of volcanogenic deposit.\n\n\n4.2\nComparison of lithology with deformation thickness and degree\n\n4.2.1\nAll SSDS\nThe thickness distribution of all SSDS with a deformation degree of intraclast breccia differs significantly (i.e. p\u202f<\u202f0.05 through Mann-Whitney-U tests) from those of disturbed laminations and folds (i.e. p\u202f=\u202f0.02 and p\u202f=\u202f0.03, respectively; Fig. 6a). The thickness distributions of folds versus disturbed lamination do not show a statistically significant difference with p\u202f=\u202f0.46.\nDeformation degree of all SSDS does not correlate with any of the measured sediment properties (i.e. average D50, radiodensity, biogenic opal or organic matter content; Fig. 6b).\nOf the 25 SSDS intervals related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, 17 stratigraphically correlate to one of the six megathrust earthquakes (i.e. 68\u202f%). Furthermore, 18 of the 25 SSDS intervals occur directly above a volcanogenic deposit (Figs. 6c and 7\n for examples). Of those 18 SSDS intervals with a basal volcanogenic deposit, 15 are located above a finer-grained volcanogenic deposit (i.e. lahar deposit or clastic mm-scale laminations) and three above a coarse-grained volcanogenic deposit (i.e. tephra). For the SSDS intervals above a fine-grained volcanogenic deposit, 8 out of 15 SSDS intervals had the volcanogenic material incorporated into the SSDS, while for the ones linked to tephra, one out of three is incorporated into the SSDS. In 5 out of 7 cases where several SSDS types occur within a single SSDS interval, the transition to the next SSDS type is formed by a volcanogenic deposit. The thickness distributions of SSDS intervals with and without a volcanogenic deposit as base layer do not statistically differ (i.e. p-value >0.05). However, SSDS with a volcanogenic deposit as base layer exhibit the largest thicknesses of up to 25\u202fcm, whereas SSDS intervals without volcanogenic base layer are all thinner than 8\u202fcm. The SSDSs with a thickness of >8\u202fcm correspond to sites with highest slope angles (i.e. >3.5\u00b0).\n\n\n4.2.2\n1960 and 1575\u202fCE-related SSDS\n\n4.2.2.1\nDeformation thickness\nThe 1960 and 1575\u202fCE earthquakes have strikingly similar historical and geological evidence, and are both assigned to a full rupture of the Valdivia Segment resulting in highly similar shaking strength and estimated PGA (detailed explanation in Section 2.1). Therefore, we compare SSDS of both earthquakes to single out the effect of slope angle and lithology on deformation thickness and degree, as we can minimize the influence of PGA variation (i.e. shaking strength). For a given slope angle, the SSDS intervals linked to the 1960\u202fCE earthquake are consistently thicker than for the 1575\u202fCE earthquake ranging from 3-25\u202fcm and 1\u20138\u202fcm and mean deformation thickness of 9 and 3\u202fcm, respectively (Fig. 6d). The 1575\u202fCE earthquake caused two thin (i.e. 1 and 1.5\u202fcm thick) SSDS intervals at slope angles below 1\u00b0, whereas the 1960\u202fCE earthquake did not.\nFor the 1960\u202fCE earthquake, three out of five SSDS have a volcanogenic deposit as basal layer (Fig. 6e). Most commonly (i.e. two times) the basal layer is formed by the first available volcanogenic deposit in the stratigraphy at ~6\u202fcm below the stratigraphic depth coinciding with the 1960\u202fCE earthquake. The two SSDS intervals without volcanogenic deposit as basal layer classify as disturbed laminations. For the 1575\u202fCE earthquake, all five SSDS occur above a volcanogenic deposit. The basal layer is often (i.e. four times) formed by the first available volcanogenic deposit at about 1 and 2\u202fcm below the stratigraphic horizon corresponding to the 1575\u202fCE earthquake. Also, the most common basal layers for both earthquakes' SSDS correspond to a Su drop of 31\u202f% and 9\u202f% compared to overlying sediment.\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nDeformation degree\nThe 1575\u202fCE earthquake caused higher deformation degrees than the 1960\u202fCE earthquake: almost exclusively intraclast breccias aside from one occurrence of disturbed laminations (Fig. 6d). The 1960\u202fCE earthquake created three folds and two disturbed laminations.\nDeformation degree of the SSDS related to the 1960 and 1575\u202fCE earthquakes shows strong negative correlation with biogenic opal content and strong positive correlation with radiodensity (Fig. 6f). These correlations reflect the higher biogenic opal content directly below the stratigraphic level of the 1960\u202fCE earthquake and high abundance of volcanogenic deposits\u2014linked to highest radiodensity\u2014below the stratigraphic level of the 1575\u202fCE earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nComparison of slope angle and shaking strength with deformation thickness and degree\n\n4.3.1\nDeformation thickness\nThe SSDS thickness correlates strongly with slope angle (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, our data suggest that at higher slope angles higher maximum SSDS thickness can occur, whereas only thin SSDS (i.e. 1\u202fcm) are created at slope angles below 1\u00b0\u2014i.e. 0.2\u00b0 and 0.6\u00b0. Maximum possible SSDS thickness also increases with PGA. Furthermore, only highest PGA\u20140.57\u202fg\u2014deformed sediment at slope angles below 1\u00b0.\n\n\n4.3.2\nDeformation degree\nDeformation degree correlates best with PGA (Fig. 8b). The earthquakes that caused strongest shaking at lake Ri\u00f1ihue created more SSDS intervals with higher deformation degrees (i.e. folds and intraclast breccia). Only three SSDS intervals with disturbed laminations as maximum deformation degree correlate to the earthquakes with strongest shaking (i.e. PGA 0.57\u202fg). The earthquakes that caused less strong shaking mostly created disturbed laminations with exceptions in core RIN17\u201308: an intraclast breccia and fold for the 1837 and 1737\u202fCE earthquakes, respectively.\nDeformation degree shows no correlation with slope angle as all deformation types occur over the entire range of slope angles. For example, at the lowest slope angles (i.e. <1\u00b0), only SSDS intervals with the highest deformation degree\u2014intraclast breccia\u2014occur.\n\n\n4.3.3\nDeformation degree versus deformation thickness\nGenerally, the SSDS with higher deformation degree (i.e. folds and intraclast breccias) have lower deformation thickness than SSDS with lower deformation degree (i.e. disturbed lamination; Fig. 8c). The disturbed laminations have the largest spread in deformation thickness compared to the folds and intraclast breccia. The outliers in deformation thickness for both folds and intraclast breccia coincide with the highest slope angle (i.e. 4.9\u00b0; core RIN17\u201311) and highest PGA (i.e. ~0.57\u202fg corresponding to the 1960\u202fCE and 1575\u202fCE earthquakes).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nLithologies\nThe PC1 has positive loading of inc\/coh, Mn and Si and highest values for clusters 5 and 6 (purple and green), which correspond to highest biogenic opal and organic matter content, respectively. Therefore, element loading of PC1 corresponds well with sediment composition as inc\/coh is a commonly-used proxy for organic matter content (e.g. Woodward and Gadd, 2019) and diatoms mainly consist of silica (e.g. Kylander et al., 2011). The PC1 has lowest values for cluster 4 (red), which correlates to all tephra and lahar deposits. Based on the correspondence of sediment composition (i.e. biogenic opal and organic matter content) with XRF data and lithologies, we propose that PC1 indicates the ratio between organic matter and biogenic opal content versus volcanogenic and terrigenous input. Higher PC1 values would indicate higher organic matter and biogenic opal content, whereas lower values point towards more terrigenous material within the sediment. Based on PC1 values, sediment composition and correlation to core images, we also interpret clusters 1, 2 and 3 (yellow, blue and orange) as background sediment with increasing biogenic opal and organic matter content and decreasing terrigenous material from lowest to highest cluster number.\nNot only the tephra and lahar deposits, but also clastic mm-scale laminations within background sediment correlate to cluster 4 (red). The grain-size distribution of these clastic mm-scale laminations is distinctly finer than that of background sediments (i.e. larger contribution of clay to fine silts; Fig. 5d), but their magnetic susceptibility is not higher, as is the case for tephra and lahar deposits. The footprint of the magnetic susceptibility point sensor (i.e. Bartingtion MS2E) is 3.8\u202fmm, which could explain why magnetic susceptibility increases caused by the fine mm-scale clastic laminations remain undetected. Previous research at lakes Calafqu\u00e9n and Villarrica, two other glacigenic piedmont lakes within the region, reported clastic mm-scale laminations with similar characteristics: a grain-size distribution of clays to medium silts being finer than background sediment; similar chemical composition to tephra and lahar deposits and similar magnetic susceptibility as background sediments (Van Daele et al., 2014). These laminations were interpreted as volcaniclastic run-off deposits (so-called cryptotephras by Van Daele et al., 2014), which indirectly originate from volcanic eruptions. Volcanic eruptions deposit large quantities of igneous material within the catchment area leading to increased fluvial input of volcaniclastic sediment during subsequent high-precipitation events. Based on our data and the high similarity to observations at lakes Calafqu\u00e9n and Villarrica, we also interpret the clastic mm-scale laminations of cluster 4 (red) as volcaniclastic run-off deposits.\n\n\n5.2\nStratigraphic relation of SSDS with seismo-turbidites\nIn our studied cores, 32\u202f% of SSDS do not stratigraphically correlate to any of the six megathrust earthquakes. These SSDS could have been created by i) local smaller earthquakes that did not generate widespread seismo-turbidites in the studied basin or ii) subsurface deformation deeper in the sedimentary sequence (i.e. not at the sediment-water interface) caused by one of the six megathrust earthquakes (Molenaar et al., 2021). Earthquakes in the downgoing plate and upper continental crust are potential sources of local earthquakes (e.g. Moernaut et al., 2014). However, these local events have significantly lower shaking strength than the megathrust earthquakes as only the latter link to turbidites in the studied basin. Another possibility is that one of the six studied megathrust earthquakes caused deformation deeper in the sedimentary sequence (i.e. not at the sediment-water interface) at levels of lower shear strength such as at the interface from volcanogenic deposits to background sediment (Wiemer et al., 2015; Moernaut et al., 2019). This subsurface deformation could create new SSDS in the sedimentary sequence or even lead to reworking of stratigraphically older SSDS (Alsop et al., 2022). Therefore, subsurface deformation could lead to i) overestimation of the amount of megathrust earthquakes as SSDS related to subsurface deformation are falsely interpreted as being triggered by unique older megathrust earthquakes or ii) overestimation of the deformation degree for SSDS related to older earthquakes (i.e. due to overprinting). Using our method, we cannot distinguish if SSDS were created by smaller local earthquakes or through subsurface deformation by younger megathrust earthquakes. Moreover, the diameter of our core (i.e. 6.3\u202fcm) is too small to reliably assess if older SSDS were reworked by younger megathrust earthquakes as any evidence of reworking can easily be missed during coring. In our study, we try to address this limitation by only considering SSDS that stratigraphically correlate to a basinal seismo-turbidite when evaluating the effect of shaking strength on deformation thickness and degree. We propose that deformation at the sediment-water interface by megathrust earthquakes is still more important at our setting than deformation by smaller local earthquakes or subsurface deformation as most of the studied SSDS intervals stratigraphically link to one of the six megathrust earthquakes (i.e. 68\u202f%).\n\n\n5.3\nThe effect of lithology on soft-sediment deformation\n\n5.3.1\nThe role of volcanogenic deposits\nMost SSDS were observed directly above volcanogenic deposits (i.e. 72\u202f%) and mainly above fine-grained lahar deposits and volcaniclastic run-off deposits (i.e. 83\u202f% of cases). In addition, transitions between SSDS types within single SSDS intervals are in most cases (i.e. 71\u202f%) formed by volcanogenic deposits (e.g. Fig. 7a, f and j). Previous research at other Chilean lacustrine settings also reported SSDS above tephra deposits (Melnick et al., 2006; Moernaut et al., 2019). In the Dead Sea basin detrital-rich layers formed internal detachments within single slump masses (Alsop and Marco, 2014). Volcanogenic deposits within laminated background sediment in lake Ri\u00f1ihue (or clastic layers at other settings) can potentially be weakened by seismic shaking and serve as basal shear surface promoting earthquake-induced deformation or failure (e.g. Locat et al., 2014; Alsop et al., 2016; Gatter et al., 2021). Strain softening involves a reduction in shear strength due to earthquake-induced strain commonly associated to particle rearrangement (e.g. Skempton, 1964; Gatter et al., 2021). Liquefaction describes an earthquake-induced increase of pore pressure until the effective stress is essentially zero and the sediment transforms from solid to liquefied state (e.g. Youd, 1973). Strain softening rather occurs in cohesive clay-rich sediments, whereas liquefaction rather occurs in silt-to-sand-sized cohesionless sediment with low clay mineral content (e.g. Bray and Sancio, 2006). Dewatering of volcanogenic deposits can promote deformation when expelled excess pore-water encounters a layer with lower permeability (i.e. a baffle), thereby forming a thin water film directly at the interface between the volcanogenic deposit and overlying sediment (Kokusho, 1999; Kokusho and Kojima, 2002). Water film formation could also occur when seismically-induced strength reduction is not sufficient to provoke failure of the layer itself. We propose that strain softening and liquefaction would weaken and deform the volcanogenic deposit (or clastic layer) itself and lead to incorporation of the basal shear surface into the SSDS. In contrast, dewatering (and water film formation) concentrates strain directly at the interface between basal shear surface and overlying sediments, thereby not leading to incorporation of the basal shear surface into the SSDS. We suggest that volcanogenic deposits with more clay content (i.e. volcaniclastic run-off and lahar deposits at lake Ri\u00f1ihue) would rather fail due to strain softening, whereas coarser tephra-fall deposits would be subjected to liquefaction. We observe that fine-grained lahar and volcaniclastic run-off deposits are incorporated into SSDS intervals for 53\u202f% of the studied SSDS intervals and only one of the three tephra deposits shows incorporation into an SSDS interval. These observations of basal shear surface incorporation suggest that strain softening and liquefaction took place for fine- and coarse-grained volcanogenic deposits, respectively. However, our study approach cannot provide negative evidence for strain softening and liquefaction (i.e. no incorporation of the basal shear surface) as our sediment cores are mere pinpricks within the lake Ri\u00f1ihue slopes (i.e. core diameter of 6.3\u202fcm): Evidence of basal shear surface incorporation can easily be missed. Our data suggest that all three types of volcanogenic deposits observed at lake Ri\u00f1ihue (i.e. lahar deposits, tephra and volcaniclastic run-off layers) can serve as basal shear surface during deformation. To exactly pinpoint the failure modes responsible for deformation, geotechnical lab tests or numerical or analogue modeling is necessary using geotechnical characteristics of our sediments.\nHistorical and geological evidence of the 1960 and 1575\u202fCE earthquakes are highly similar. Therefore, both earthquakes are assigned to a full rupture of the Valdivia Segment with similar shaking strength at lake Ri\u00f1ihue (see Section 2.1). Despite similar ground-motion characteristics, the SSDS related to the 1960\u202fCE earthquake are consistently thicker per site than SSDS related to the 1575\u202fCE earthquake with average deformation thickness of 9 and 3\u202fcm, respectively (Fig. 6d). Commonly, the basal shear surface of SSDS corresponds to the first volcanogenic deposit within the stratigraphy and a drop in Su for both the 1960 and 1575\u202fCE earthquakes (i.e. 2 and 3 out of 5 occurrences, respectively; Fig. 6e). Numerical modeling for slope sedimentary sequences shows that seismically-induced displacement accumulates above basal shear surfaces forming a distinct offset in permanent displacement profiles with depth just at the interface of the basal shear surface (Biscontin and Pestana, 2006; Stoecklin et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017). We propose that the stratigraphic depth of the youngest preceding volcanogenic deposits controlled the difference in deformation thickness between the 1575\u202fCE and 1960\u202fCE-related SSDS, as strain accumulated preferably above the youngest preceding volcanogenic deposits, which was slightly deeper for the 1960\u202fCE earthquake.\nThe 1575\u202fCE earthquake caused higher deformation degrees than the 1960\u202fCE earthquake: i.e. almost exclusively intraclast breccia versus mostly folds. The thickness distribution of all intraclast breccias is significantly lower than that of the disturbed laminations and folds, whereas the latter two do not statistically differ in thickness. Shear seismic energy density increases when deforming sequences are thinner leading to higher efficiency of deformation related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for a given PGA (numerical models by Wetzler et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2020). Also, thin (i.e. ~1\u202fcm) SSDS occur on slopes below 1\u00b0 slope angle for the 1575\u202fCE earthquake, but not for the 1960\u202fCE earthquake. Gravitational downslope stress increases with slope angle and eases deformation by enabling downslope movement of sediment during seismic shaking (Biscontin and Pestana, 2006; Molenaar et al., 2021). For the 1575\u202fCE earthquake, earthquake-induced shear stress within the thin (i.e. ~1\u202fcm) sequence above the first stratigraphically-available volcanogenic deposit sufficed to deform sediment, even at sites with very low gravitational stress (i.e. slope angles of <1\u00b0). We suggest that both the i) higher deformation degree for 1575\u202fCE-related SSDS and ii) the occurrence of SSDS at slope angles <1\u00b0 are due to corresponding lower depth of the youngest preceding volcanogenic deposit, which reduced the thickness of the deforming sequence and resulted in higher shear seismic energy density within the deforming sequences.\n\n\n5.3.2\nThe role of sediment composition\nWe observe no correlation between deformation degree and sediment composition when comparing all SSDS (i.e. with and without stratigraphic link to one of the six megathrust earthquakes). However, deformation degree of the 1960\u202fCE and 1575\u202fCE earthquake SSDS correlates negatively with biogenic opal content, which reflects diatom content (Fig. 6f). Diatoms have a strengthening effect on sediment due to high particle interlocking and surface roughness (Wiemer et al., 2017). Therefore, increased diatom content could reduce the propensity of sediments to deformation. However, our data does not provide conclusive evidence for this relation, as the strong influence of the stratigraphic depth of youngest preceding volcanogenic deposit (see Section 5.3.1 for more detailed description) might overshadow the influence of general lithology on deformation. More studies are required on SSDS within different lithologies without intercalated clastic layers, preferably impacted by the same recent earthquake, to conclusively evaluate the effect of sediment composition on deformation degree.\n\n\n\n5.4\nRanking the influence of different factors on deformation thickness and degree\n\n5.4.1\nDeformation thickness\nDeformation thickness correlates strongly with slope angle (Fig. 8a). Gravitational downslope stress increases with slope angle, thereby adding up to earthquake-induced shear stress and promoting deformation (e.g. Molenaar et al., 2021). The sensitivity of deformation to gravitational stress is also reflected along the Dead Sea Basin where slump folds are orientated downslope even at slope angles <1\u00b0 (Alsop and Marco, 2012). In line with these observations, numerical models also report an increase of deformation thickness with slope angle as larger strain accumulates on deeper portions of the sedimentary sequence with steeper slope angles (Biscontin and Pestana, 2006; Zhou et al., 2017). Additionally, deformation thickness at lake Ri\u00f1ihue is regulated by the stratigraphic depth of the youngest preceding volcanogenic deposit during seismic shaking (Section 5.3.1 and Fig. 6e). However, at higher slope angles (i.e. RIN17\u201311, 4.9\u00b0), strain did not accumulate above the topmost volcanogenic deposits, but above deeper ones (e.g. Fig. 6e lowest purple arrow for both the 1960\u202fCE and 1575\u202fCE earthquake). We propose that this is due to increase of the thickness of the stratigraphy affected by deformation with steeper slope angles. Based on our data and in line with previous studies, we propose that deformation thickness is primarily controlled by slope angle and secondarily by stratigraphic depth of volcanogenic deposits (Fig. 9\n).\nWe do not observe an overall correlation between deformation thickness and PGA, as earthquakes that caused strongest shaking at the lake caused only minor imprint within some studied cores. However, the maximum observed deformation thickness does increase with PGA (Fig. 8). Based on these data and findings as described in the previous paragraph, we suggest that it is possible that higher PGA increases deformation thickness of individual SSDS, but that slope angle\u2014the primary control on deformation thickness\u2014potentially overshadows its effect. Additional research targeting a large number of sites with similar slope angles and lithology and comprising multiple SSDS correlated to different earthquakes would be required to test this. Our data do not comprise sufficient cores with SSDS related to both stronger shaking (i.e. 1960 and 1575\u202fCE earthquakes) and less strong shaking (i.e. 1837, 1737 and ~1466\u202fCE earthquakes). Moreover, the 1575\u202fCE earthquake, which caused the strongest shaking at lake Ri\u00f1ihue, created SSDS at the two studied sites with slope angles <1\u00b0 (i.e. CRIN8 and CRIN10; Fig. 6d) despite low gravitational downslope stress. Based on this observation, we propose that only the earthquakes that caused the strongest shaking at our setting can create sufficient seismically-induced shear stress to deform sediment at slope angles <1\u00b0. Based on our data, we propose that stronger shaking generally increases the maximum possible deformation thickness and reduces the slope angle at which deformation can occur by enhancing earthquake-induced shear stress.\n\nMolenaar et al. (2021) found that the deformation thickness summed per site and per earthquake (so-called total deformation thickness) increases with both slope angle and PGA, respectively. For individual SSDS\u2014as investigated in our study\u2014we observe that the deformation thickness correlates strongly (i.e. positive) with slope angle, but not with PGA (Fig. 8a). Therefore, our data show that the increase of total deformation thickness with slope angle, as observed by Molenaar et al. (2021), can be explained by the increase of deformation thickness of individual SSDS with slope angle (Fig. 8a). In contrast, the increase of total deformation thickness with PGA, as observed by Molenaar et al., 2021, relies more on the larger spatial extent of deformation for higher PGA earthquakes (i.e. resulting in more affected sites) than an actual thickness increase of individual SSDS.\n\n\n5.4.2\nDeformation degree\nDeformation degree increases with PGA as earthquakes that caused strongest shaking created almost exclusively folds and intraclast breccia (e.g. Fig. 7a, e, g, j and k). Earthquakes that resulted in less strong shaking almost only created disturbed laminations (e.g. Fig. 7j) with the exception of a fold and intraclast breccia in core RIN17\u201308 for the 1737\u202fCE and 1837\u202fCE earthquakes, respectively (Fig. 7d). However, as discussed in detail in Section 5.3.1, also the thickness of deforming sequences has a control on deformation degree as thinner sequences result in higher shear seismic energy density at same PGA. Our field data corroborate the connection between PGA and deformation degree modulated by the thickness of deforming sequence as proposed by numerical models for the Dead Sea Basin (Heifetz et al., 2005; Wetzler et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2020).\nIntraclast breccia at our studied lake are significantly thinner than disturbed lamination and folds (Figs. 6a and 8c). This observation is supported by numerical modeling, showing that intraclast breccias can only be formed in thin deforming sequences at given PGAs with a maximum of ~20\u202fcm at PGA of 1\u202fg (Lu et al., 2020). Moreover, we observe the thickest intraclast breccia (i.e. 8\u202fcm) at the highest slope angle of 4.9\u00b0 (Fig. 8\nc) and propose that higher slope angles increase the maximum thickness of deforming sequence in which intraclast breccia can form.\nSediment composition, such as higher diatom content, might reduce the propensity of sediment to deformation. However, this effect of sediment composition (for the lithologies in our study) would be highly overruled by the influence of PGA and thickness of deforming sequence, because the compositional differences within a single lake (studied here) are probably not sufficient when compared to the large differences in other parameters. Further studies are required on more lake systems with different lithologies to properly investigate the link between sediment composition and deformation degree.\n\n\n\n5.5\nImplications for quantitative paleoseismology\nDeformation degree in combination with deformation thickness was already used to estimate PGA in continuously stratified sediment of the Dead Sea (Lu et al., 2020). Our study shows that the link between deformation degree and PGA is generally also valid in settings with varying lithotypes and intercalated clastic deposits (i.e. volcanogenic deposits at lake Ri\u00f1ihue). For our studied lithologies, it is necessary to core at slope sites to detect deformation, as only the 1575\u202fCE earthquake caused deformation at slope angles <1\u00b0. Also, we recommend to study multiple cores as relying on a single sediment core to create a paleoseismic record would potentially lead to under- or overestimation of PGA: earthquakes related to strongest shaking did in some cases not create a SSDS at specific sites, whereas earthquakes that related to less strong shaking did. It must be noted that previous research showed that in other lithologies (i.e. other than presented within this study) a single sediment core taken at a flat basin did provide a good paleoseismic record (e.g. Monecke et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2020; Oswald et al., 2021). This shows that it is necessary to evaluate the susceptibility of the sediment to deformation to develop an appropriate research strategy before applying SSDS-based paleoseismology at a different setting.\nDeformation thickness\u2014at our setting\u2014is not a good indicator of shaking strength as several factors other than PGA influence deformation thickness, for example, the presence of volcanogenic deposits serving as basal shear surface. However, it is crucial to measure and implement the deformation thickness of SSDS to derive PGA from deformation degree, as thicker deforming sequences would result in lower deformation degrees at a given PGA (e.g. Lu et al., 2020, and as discussed in detail in Section 5.3.1). Potentially, for sites that are continuously stratified and do not contain abundant clastic deposits, deformation thickness alone can be used as a paleoseismic indicator when corrected for slope angle, which is the main controlling factor on SSDS thickness.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nOur study is the first that simultaneously investigates the influence of lithology, slope angle and shaking strength on soft-sediment deformation related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at a natural setting. This allowed us to rank the influence of these factors on deformation characteristics (i.e. deformation thickness and degree). The following conclusions were made:\n\n\u2022\nBoth fine- (i.e. volcaniclastic run-off and lahar deposits) and coarser-grained (i.e. tephras) volcanogenic deposits can serve as basal shear surface and promote earthquake-induced deformation. Fine-grained volcanogenic deposits can fail due to strain softening and coarser-grained tephras by liquefaction, which both leads to incorporation of the basal shear surface into the SSDS. In addition, dewatering of both fine- and coarse-grained volcanogenic deposits can lead to water film formation, which concentrates strain exactly at the interface of basal shear surface and overlying background sediment, thereby hampering incorporation of the basal shear surface into the SSDS.\n\n\n\u2022\nDeformation thickness is in the first order modulated by slope angle. Secondarily, stratigraphic depth of volcanogenic deposits regulates deformation thickness. At steeper slope angles, stratigraphically deeper volcanogenic deposits can serve as basal shear surface. The maximum possible deformation thickness is controlled by shaking strength in combination with slope angle. The minimum slope angle at which deformation can occur is regulated by strong ground motion in combination with volcanogenic deposits available at shallow stratigraphic depth.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe suggest that deformation thickness is not a reliable indicator of shaking strength as it depends on many other factors other than shaking strength. Deformation thickness might be an indicator of seismic shaking strength at settings with only one lithotype, but this relation must be validated.\n\n\n\u2022\nDeformation degree is in first order regulated by shaking strength as this seems to control both extent of deformation throughout the studied basin and deformation degree, as more of the studied sedimentary sequences comprise SSDS with highest deformation degrees (i.e. folds or intraclast breccia) for earthquakes related to strongest shaking. Secondarily, the thickness of the deforming sequence regulates deformation degree: Lower thickness of the deforming sequence leads to higher shear seismic energy density, which results in higher deformation degrees and enables deformation at lower slope angles (i.e. <1\u00b0). Diatom content might also influence deformation degree by reducing the propensity of sediment to deformation.\n\n\n\u2022\nBased on the lake Ri\u00f1ihue record, we suggest that deformation degree can provide a good indication of shaking strength even in sediments with varying sediment composition and intercalated clastic layers when deformation degree is corrected by deformation thickness. At settings with similar lithologies as presented within this study, multiple cores on sites with slope angles of >1\u00b0 are preferred for paleoseismological studies, as studying a single core from a flat basin might result in under- or overestimation of paleoseismic PGA.\n\n\n\n\n","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\nIntroduction\nChannel-network evolution in dryland river systems is largely regulated by avulsion dynamics (Kelly and Olsen, 1993; Nichols and Fisher, 2007; Donselaar et al., 2013). Avulsion is a multiscale threshold process that may divert river flow outside the main (or parent) channel toward adjacent low-lying floodplain topography, and thus alter the downstream distribution of fluvial sediments (Leeder, 1978; Bridge and Leeder, 1979; Mackey and Bridge, 1995; Heller and Paola, 1996; Jones and Schumm, 1999; Mohrig et al., 2000; Slingerland and Smith, 2004; Hajek and Edmonds, 2014). Thus, studies of modern and ancient dryland sediments deposited between the gravel\u2013sand transition in the vicinity of orogenic belts and the terminal part of the sediment dispersal system rely heavily on quantitative analysis of the mechanisms and frequency of avulsions (Bryant et al., 1995; Jerolmack and Mohrig, 2007; Donselaar et al., 2022).\nField studies of modern and ancient fluvial systems provide a valuable, yet fragmented record of avulsion recurrences spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales (Makaske et al., 2002; Slingerland and Smith, 2004; Aslan et al., 2005; Jones and Hajek, 2007; Stouthamer et al., 2011; Hajek and Wolinsky, 2012; Edmonds et al., 2016). The length of inter-avulsion periods documented in the literature spans up to seven orders of magnitude (10\u22121 to 106\u202fyr). Edmonds et al. (2016) suggested that around 60% of recent avulsion events in Andean and Himalayan basins were partial, and that successful (or stabilized) local avulsions take around 11\u202fyrs from initiation to completion. Experimental and field evidence demonstrates that avulsion frequency correlates positively with aggradation rate. The normalized super-elevation (defined as the ratio of alluvial ridge height to channel depth) is a dimensionless measure of a fluvial system's susceptibility to avulsion. The time interval needed to form a deposit of unit thickness, i.e., equal to channel depth, may thus be regarded as a fundamental control on the time evolution of fluvial architecture (Bryant et al., 1995; Heller and Paola, 1996; Jerolmack and Mohrig, 2007). Phillips (2011), Mor\u03ccn et al. (2017), and Nicholas et al. (2018) suggested that the normalized super-elevation at which avulsion is likely to occur decreases in the presence of episodic peak discharges as occurring in dryland fluvial systems.\nDryland fluvial systems are characterized by sparse vegetation, which impacts on the sediment transport process, fluvial morphodynamics and resultant sedimentary architecture (Ielpi and Lap\u00f4tre, 2019; Ielpi et al., 2022). The rivers are inactive during prolonged dry periods, which may last from months up to yrs (Garreaud et al., 2003; Li, 2014; Li et al., 2014). Their deposits form during short periods (days) of extremely high precipitation leading to high liquid and solid river discharge. Such peak-discharge events are highly variable in semi-arid regions. In addition, the climate conditions in dryland\u2013river settings imply that the ephemeral channelized flow is subject to transmission losses, owing to large-scale flood-outs out of the channel confinement and onto the floodplain, infiltration and rapid evapotranspiration of excess surface water (Knighton and Nanson, 1994; Lange, 2005; Powell, 2009; Thornes, 2009; Costa et al., 2012; Costa et al., 2013; Donselaar et al., 2013, 2022; Jarihani et al., 2015; Fielding et al., 2018; Henares et al., 2020). Channel-network evolution in dryland river systems is largely regulated by river-avulsion dynamics (Kelly and Olsen, 1993; Nichols and Fisher, 2007; Donselaar et al., 2022). Avulsion diverts river flow from the main (parent) channel toward adjacent sectors of the floodplain, and thus strongly affects the spatial distribution of fluvial sediments deposited downstream of the avulsion point (Leeder, 1978; Bridge and Leeder, 1979; Mackey and Bridge, 1995; Heller and Paola, 1996; Jones and Schumm, 1999; Mohrig et al., 2000; Slingerland and Smith, 2004; Hajek and Edmonds, 2014). In reservoir-geological terms, the thin-bedded fluvial deposits associated with avulsions that are present at the fringes of channel belts and in topographically low sectors of the floodplain are volumetrically important lithofacies units. Their lateral dimensions, internal geometries, and connectivity are poorly resolved by conventional seismic and well-log data, and therefore remain underexplored topics (Nichols and Fisher, 2007; Van Toorenenburg et al., 2016; Colombera et al., 2017; De Jong et al., 2020; Donselaar et al., 2022).\nQuantitative analysis of the mechanisms, locations, and frequency of avulsions in dryland\u2013river systems is a prerequisite for capturing the morphodynamic processes and understanding the spatial distribution of channel-belt deposits over time (Bryant et al., 1995; Jerolmack and Mohrig, 2007; Donselaar et al., 2022). Thus, there is a genuine need to investigate the following: (a) the role of river avulsions in geomorphological evolution, (b) the architectural arrangement of channel-belt sediment bodies, and (c) the preservation potential of terminal river systems.\nIn this study, we present a data-model comparison of the Holocene deposits of the Rio Colorado river system (Altiplano Basin, Bolivia). Satellite imagery, sedimentological and geochronological data were used to set the initial and boundary conditions for a basin-scale advection\u2013diffusion model of fluvial processes (SimClast: Dalman and Weltje, 2008, 2012), and compare its output with the observed deposit geometries. The model was used to simulate the evolution of the medial and distal parts of the dryland fluvial system under different sediment-load scenarios. We used channel-network evolution, fluvial-fan dimensions and estimated inter-avulsion periods as benchmarks for data-model comparison.\n\n\n1.2\nTerminology: avulsion type, style, setup and threshold\nIn this section we provide a brief history of avulsion-related terminology to clarify the different avulsion terms in this study. Based on numerical experiments with a two-dimensional alluvial stratigraphic model, Leeder (1978) subdivided avulsion behavior (or type) into nodal and random. The former originates from a relatively fixed area on the floodplain, whereas the latter may occur anywhere along the active channel. Heller and Paola (1996) characterized avulsions as local or regional based on the downstream distance over which the newly-formed channel remains outside its former course. Slingerland and Smith (2004) recognized full (also termed successful or stabilized) and partial avulsions based on whether the entire flow, or only a portion of it, is transferred out of the main channel, respectively. They also summarized three avulsion style end-members based on distinct floodplain responses: (1) avulsion by annexation, in which a channel is captured or reoccupied, (2) avulsion by incision, and (3) avulsion by progradation. Hajek and Edmonds (2014) quantified the intermediate states between incisional and progradational avulsion styles while also underscoring the significance of floodplain morphodynamics to condition sedimentation patterns in avulsive systems. Mohrig et al. (2000) summarized avulsion setup in terms of two different measures: (a) levee growth, which increases the ratio of cross-floodplain to along-river gradients, and (b) superelevation, which \u2018calculates the relief between the water-surface elevation in a channel at bankfull discharge (i.e., levee height) to the minimum elevation of the adjacent flood plain (\n\nHeller and Paola, 1996\n\n). It is possible that these two measures are correlated if levee slope becomes steeper as the total amount of superelevation increases, such as in the model of\n\nSlingerland and Smith (1998)\n\u2019. Avulsion thresholds control avulsion initiation and may either refer to short term (annual to decadal) conditions under which a bifurcation or crevasse channel becomes stable or to long-term conditions that cause a full regional avulsion at landscape\/architecture scale (Hajek and Wolinsky, 2012). After avulsion initiation, the distributed flow adjacent to the parent channel will seek for gradient advantage on the floodplain (Hoyal and Sheets, 2009; Reitz et al., 2010). Ultimately, the stabilization of a newly-formed crevasse channel is achieved by the appropriate combination of local conditions (i.e. cross-channel flow potential exceeding a certain threshold level, bed geometry at bifurcation sites, factors favoring floodplain incision) and an optimal downstream path at landscape-scale (Slingerland and Smith, 2004; Kleinhans et al., 2013; Hajek and Edmonds, 2014; Edmonds et al., 2016; Nienhuis et al., 2018). Finally, Jones and Schumm (1999) subdivided the conditions necessary for an avulsion into two main groups (or setups): (a) a long-term setup in which the channel gradually increases its susceptibility to avulsion and (b) a short-term trigger that initiates the avulsion (i.e. episodic peak discharges).\n\n\n\n2\nData and methods\n\n2.1\nField area and avulsion history\nThe Altiplano Basin is a high-altitude (3650\u20134200\u202fm), internally drained (endorheic) semi-arid basin, filled by Cretaceous to Holocene fluvio-lacustrine and eolian sediments (Donselaar et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014). The basin is in a tectonically quiescent phase since the onset of the Holocene, with only minor vertical uplift at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3\u202fmm\/yr (Gregory-Wodzicki, 2000). The Holocene history of the modern Rio Colorado dryland river system in the Altiplano Basin (Bolivia) has been reconstructed in detail (Donselaar et al., 2013, 2022; Li, 2014; Li et al., 2015; Van Toorenenburg, 2018; Van Toorenenburg et al., 2018). The system provides a suitable analog for our study as it has undergone limited anthropogenic modifications. Analysis of satellite imagery, sedimentology, and geochronology of the Rio Colorado enabled the sequential reconstruction of the sediment routing system between the west flank of the Andean Cordillera Oriental and the terminal part of the sediment dispersal system, where the river ends on the salt flat bordering the Salar de Uyuni salt lake (Fig. 1\n).\nThe total drainage area of the Rio Colorado is ca. 15,000\u202fkm2 (Donselaar et al., 2013), and the river is subdivided into five sections from source to sink: (1) upstream section with small tributary channels, (2) confined river in a narrow gorge, (3) steeply-dipping alluvial-fan (bajada), (4) upper coastal plain with straight midstream river section, and (5) meandering-river section in the lower coastal plain (Fig. 2A).\nDischarge events in the study area typically last 24\u201348\u202fh, with peak discharges exceeding 100\u202fm3\/s (Donselaar et al., 2013; Li, 2014). The volume of floodwater in periods of peak discharge by far exceeds the capacity of the river to maintain the flow within its channel banks. Hence, large-scale flood-outs occur, with formation of levees, crevasse-channel, crevasse-splay and terminal-splay deposits along the trunk river. Aggradation of these deposits to an alluvial ridge leads to the decrease of the along-river gradient and simultaneous increase of the cross-floodplain gradient, which favors the initiation and stabilization of river avulsions (Mohrig et al., 2000; Donselaar et al., 2013, 2022; Li, 2014; Van Toorenenburg et al., 2018). The in-channel gradient of the lower lacustrine coastal plain is extremely low (1:12,000), fluvial incision is minimal to absent, and channel width and depth decrease downstream (Donselaar et al., 2013).\nSuccessive Rio Colorado river paths all started with a low to moderately sinuous (SI 1.25 to 1.58) trajectory bordered by small lateral bars, and gradually evolved into highly sinuous (SI 1.70 to 2.56) streams by point-bar lateral accretion (Donselaar et al., 2022). The geochronology of the river avulsions, and the mean inter-avulsion period were established with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of 18 sediment samples, collected in shallow pits at the interface of the last point-bar lateral-accretion deposits with the abandoned-channel fill, thus capturing the time of abandonment of the river path. Intra-avulsion periods are up to 1.28\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.34\u202fkyr. The present-day path of the Rio Colorado river system initiated by avulsion at 0.62\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13\u202fkyr\u202fBP (Donselaar et al., 2022). The resultant landform of the lower coastal plain has a convex-upward lobate shape, formed by a network of compensationally-stacked alluvial ridges (Friend et al., 1979; North and Warwick, 2007; Li et al., 2015; Van Toorenenburg, 2018; Donselaar et al., 2022). The fluvial deposits in the lower coastal plain attain a maximum thickness of 3\u202fm and an areal extent of ca. 500\u202fkm2 (Fig. 1A). They overlay diatom-rich lacustrine clays that formed during the last lake-level highstand, which ended 11.5 kyr BP (Baker et al., 2001; Blard et al., 2011).\n\n\n2.2\nModel description\nThe synthetic stratigraphy in this study was acquired using SimClast, a model developed by Dalman and Weltje (2008). The model is capable of simulating channel network dynamics, floodplain interactions and coastal processes. The fluvial module of SimClast simulates channel-network development through the routing of dispersive flow on the floodplain (Freeman, 1991; Meijer, 2002), and advective transport in channels. River avulsions are simulated by using a simplified bifurcation-stability routine (Slingerland and Smith, 1998). A central assumption in the model is that channel-belt aggradation locally increases the ratio of cross-floodplain to in-channel gradients and thus creates favorable conditions for avulsions to occur (Slingerland and Smith, 1998; Jones and Schumm, 1999; Mohrig et al., 2000; Aslan et al., 2005; Hajek and Wolinsky, 2012; Hajek and Edmonds, 2014; Edmonds et al., 2016; Ganti et al., 2016; Nicholas et al., 2018; van Toorenenburg et al., 2018). Crevassing (or levee breaching) is regarded as a spatially random triggering mechanism conditioned by local topography that initiates channelized flow outside the parent channel. The stability of a newly-formed channel is determined by estimating the equilibrium water discharge (which is redistributed over the old channel and the crevasse channel) and corresponding sediment transport capacity of the crevasse channel, based on the vertical sediment concentration gradient in the parent channel. If sediment load exceeds transport capacity, the river bank of the parent channel will heal. Conversely, the crevasse channel will evolve by incision until its transport capacity balances the sediment load (Fig. 3\n). This approach permits simulation of a variety of phenomena characteristic of drainage network evolution: failed avulsions, stable bifurcations, full avulsions, and channel-belt re-occupation (Dalman and Weltje, 2008; Karamitopoulos et al., 2014).\n\n\n2.3\nModel boundary conditions for numerical simulation\nMass balance and scale analysis enabled the approximation of the boundary conditions for the simulations, which comprise base (lake) level and rate of sediment supply. The water-discharge (Q\n\nw\n) and sediment-load (Q\n\ns\n) values were derived from global regression curves (Blum et al., 2013) and the BQART equations (Syvitski and Milliman, 2007), respectively (Fig. 3). Based on the regression of Q\n\nw\n on catchment area (A\n\nc\n), a water discharge of 500\u202fm3\/s was derived. This estimate lies in the same order of magnitude with the peak discharge obtained by model-based ratings (https:\/\/floodobservatory.colorado.edu\/) and the input water discharges used in a previous modeling study of an analogous river system in Lake Eyre Basin, Australia (Mor\u03ccn and Amos, 2018).\nSediment load (or yield) was estimated using a variation of the BQART model (Syvitski et al., 2003; Syvitski and Milliman, 2007; Kettner et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2013; Weight et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2013; S\u00f8mme et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018; Brewer et al., 2020):\n\n(1)\n\n\nQ\ns\n\n=\n\u03c9B\n\nQ\nw\n0.31\n\n\nA\n0.5\n\nRT\n\n\nwhere Q\n\nS\n is sediment load, \u03c9 is equal to 0.0006, Q\n\nW\n is the estimated water discharge, B is the anthropogenic-geological influence factor (set equal to 1 since human influence, glacial influence and water trapping are negligible), R is the catchment maximum relief (ca. 0.45\u202fkm) and T is basin-averaged temperature (\u22652\u202f\u00b0\u202fC). By using these values, Q\n\nS\n was found equal to 0.23\u202fkm3\/yr (7.29\u202fm3\/s). We assumed that only a small fraction of the estimated sediment load (\u22641%) reaches the upstream apex of the system owing to high rates of water loss and great variability in water discharge from the drainage basin to the sediment entry point of the system. This assumption is consistent with a rudimentary volumetric approximation using a fan area of ~500\u202fkm2 and an average thickness (~1\u202fm). The product of area and thickness is equal to 0.5\u202fkm3. Assuming that the Rio Colorado river system has been active for at least 3.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.34\u202fkyr (age of oldest abandonment), the ratio of volume over this minimum age yields an averaged Q\n\nS\n on the order of 105\u202fm3\/yr (or 10\u22124\u202fkm3\/yr).\nFluvial system evolution was simulated under time-invariant external forcing for a period of 4000\u202fyr, which approximates the age of the oldest abandoned river path (Channel belt 1) in the study area (Donselaar et al., 2022). The grid cell size was set equal to 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fkm and the time step to one yr, which represents the finest spatio-temporal resolution at which the model can operate (Dalman and Weltje, 2008). For all experiments, we assumed that Q\n\nw\n and Q\n\ns\n are averaged over the course of each time step. Bifurcation and avulsion dynamics were tested under a wide range of sediment load scenarios (0.003 to 0.095\u202fm3\/s) in order to evaluate the robustness of the model results and fine-tune the model input.\nThe different scenarios were named in terms of increasing sediment load (SL): SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4 and SL5 correspond to solid river discharge of 0.003, 0.015, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.095\u202fm3\/s respectively. In each SL scenario, water and sediment were supplied at a constant rate to the upper coastal plain of the basin through a single entry point representing the boundary between the steeply-dipping alluvial fan segment and the upper coastal plain. The initial topographic surface of model was set equal to 0.0015 in order to account for the higher gradient of the upper coastal plain of the Rio Colorado river system. Sandy and muddy sediments (with a fixed grain-size distribution of 20% and 80% of each by volume) were represented by two grain-size end-members (0.5\u202fmm and 0.0001\u202fmm, respectively) in accordance with grain-size distributions of samples in the study area (Li et al., 2015). The grain-size distribution of the subsurface was set to be identical to the sediment feed.\n\n\n2.4\nQuantification of system response\nBifurcation events and avulsion occurrences were extracted from the model output. For every time step, dynamic parameters representative of water flow and sediment transport were estimated. One of the parameters is the cross-sectional area a, which is the wet area of channel cross section at mean volumetric flow rate (Q), derived from an expression of the mass (and volume) conservation equation:\n\n(2)\n\nQ\n=\n\nu\n1\n\n\na\n1\n\n=\n\nu\n2\n\n\na\n2\n\n,\n\n\nwhere u is decomposed, and represented by mean flow velocity. This is an empirical equation (also known as Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation) which relates pressure loss due to friction along a given length of a pipe to the average velocity of the fluid flow for an incompressible fluid. The equation is useful in the transition region between laminar flow and fully-developed turbulent flow. It contains a dimensionless friction factor (f\n\nD\n) which was assumed to be equal to 0.05, representative of sand-bed rivers. Another parameter which was estimated during the model runs is the aggradation to progradation (A\/P) ratio which is indicative of alluvial aggradation and equals the thickness ratio of net sediment deposited above base level to net sediment deposited below base level across the entire grid (Fig. 4\n).\nThe geomorphic end-products of the numerical experiments consist of multiple topographic maps and visualizations of sedimentation pattern and water discharge. Post-processing of the stratigraphic and water discharge output of the model enabled: (1) the clustering of channel deposits into avulsion-based river pathways (or tracts), (2) the quantification of flow occupancy defined by the percentage of simulation time a grid cell was occupied by an active channel (Ashworth et al., 2007; Van Dijk et al., 2009), and (3) calculation of the cumulative volume of total aggradation. Finally, the normalized inter-avulsion period was defined as the inter-avulsion period divided by the total period of the record (Mackey and Bridge, 1995).\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\nThe low sediment load scenarios (Qs\u202f\u2264\u202f0.03\u202fm3\/s) are characterized by straight channels and fixed drainage to the terminal part of the sediment dispersal system where symmetrical lacustrine deltas grow by means of mouth bar-induced bifurcation events at the terminus (Fig. 5A). The geomorphic pattern changes over time in the high sediment load scenarios (Qs\u202f>\u202f0.03\u202fm3\/s) as a consequence of higher rates of alluvial-ridge aggradation, deposition of higher-sinuosity channel-belt sediments and increase of cross-floodplain gradients. Such conditions favor the initiation and stabilization of avulsions (Fig. 5B).\nIn the early stage of the high-load scenario (SL5), channels remained in place for long periods of time acting mostly as conduits for sediments to reach the coastline (Fig. 6A). The emergent avulsive behavior during later stages led to dispersion and offset stacking of sediments across the floodplain forming a laterally extensive convex-upwards lobate topography with abandoned channel deposits arranged on either side of the main paleoflow axis (Fig. 6B).\nThe second part of the work focused on the comparative analysis of the modeled and observed avulsion behaviors. Avulsions extracted from SL5 are organized in three sequences (Fig. 7\n). Each sequence groups a series of avulsion sites that shift progressively upstream with a concomitant decrease in avulsion periodicity (Mackey and Bridge, 1995; Stouthamer et al., 2011). The avulsions extracted during SL5 allowed the subdivision of the simulated stratigraphy into 22 river tracts (or flow paths) and their associated deposits (Fig. 8A). Avulsions that fell below the temporal resolution limit of the morphodynamic output (40\u202fyr) were grouped in the same cluster. Avulsions included full (or stabilized), partial and failed avulsions. Post-processing of the channelized drainage evolution permitted the estimation of flow occupancy (Fig. 8B, C). The normalized avulsion periods are based on a normal kernel function evaluated at equally-spaced points covering the entire range of observed and modeled data (Fig. 9\n). The last three parts of the section focused on the architectural arrangement of a dryland fluvial succession and the preservation potential of the associated deposits.\n\n3.1\nMorphodynamic evolution\nFor all experiments, we took a regionalized approach by assuming that Q\n\nw\n and Q\n\ns\n are averaged over the course of each time step. In reality, more than 95% of the annual discharge arrives within a few days in short, high-magnitude peak-discharge events (Garreaud et al., 2003; Li, 2014). The greatest limitation of this approach is the uncertainty related to the magnitude and spatial distribution of rainfall which is a common problem when interpolating hydrological information to ungauged catchments (He et al., 2011). Water loss by flood-outs, infiltration and evapotranspiration impose additional uncertainties. Our simplified approach to regionalize streamflow properties directly avoids these issues (de Lavenne et al., 2016) because examination of causal rainfall\u2013runoff relations is not within the remit of this study.\nThe model output illustrates the relationship between morphodynamic evolution and the dominant spatio-temporal patterns of sedimentation (Fig. 6A). During the first stage of the simulation (4000\u20133200\u202fyr\u202fBP), deposition is strongly progradational and marked by a rapid increase of the cross-sectional channel area (Fig. 6A, inset). Under constant discharge rate, sediments reach the distal part of the lower coastal plain forming a symmetrical lacustrine delta. At ca. 3200\u202fyr\u202fBP, the system is punctuated by a significant decrease in the cross-sectional channel area. The longitudinal outbuilding of the system lengthens its fluvial profile, reduces equilibrium gradient and induces upstream aggradation (Dalman et al., 2015). This in turn increases the cross-floodplain gradient relative to the slope downstream and prepares the ground for an avulsion which can be initiated by a flooding (or crevassing) event (van Toorenenburg et al., 2018; Donselaar et al., 2022). In case of a full avulsion, the newly-formed channel incises into the surrounding floodplain area while a juvenile lobate unit is deposited on a topographically lower-lying area downstream. The channels are backfilled with sediments and set up the system anew to an avulsion prone state.\n\n\n3.2\nData-model comparison and avulsion thresholds\nThe data-model comparison, which was conducted on the basis of channel-belt network evolution, the fluvial-fan geometry and probability density estimates of normalized avulsion periods, showed that the observations in the Altiplano Basin are in accordance with the high sediment-load scenarios (Figs. 1, 2, 5A, 6A, B, 8). The successive Rio Colorado river paths all started with a moderately-sinuous (SI 1.25 to 1.58) trajectory bordered by small point bars, and gradually evolved into highly-sinuous (SI 1.70 to 2.56) streams with wide point bars with a large surface area (Donselaar et al., 2022). This is consistent with the modeled channelized flow (scenarios SL4 and SL5), which started with a straight single-thread channel and over time switched radially on account of continuous growth of alluvial ridges, deposition of higher-sinuosity channel-belt sediments, and the gradual increase of the ratio of cross-floodplain to along-river gradients. Compensational offset stacking of sediments formed a convex-upwards lobate topography which extends ca. 10\u202fkm in the proximal part, ca. 50\u202fkm in the distal part and is a few meters thick (2\u20135\u202fm and 2\u201312\u202fm for scenarios SL4 and SL5, respectively). Higher slopes occur in the vicinity of the main paleoflow axis with a gradual decrease toward down-valley direction. These dimensions are comparable to the lateral and longitudinal extent of the fluvial forms in the upper and lower coastal plain of the Rio Colorado river system.\nThe normalized avulsion periods are based on a normal kernel function evaluated at equally-spaced points covering the full range of observed and modeled data (Fig. 9). For the simulated scenarios, the avulsion threshold between the failed\/partial avulsions and the full ones was defined by the intercept of the first two peaks of the probability distributions (~0.045, which equals an avulsion period of 180\u202fyr). The simulated avulsion periods in scenario SL4 range from 180 to 1200\u202fyr (corresponding to 0.045 and 0.3 normalized avulsion periods, respectively), whereas the estimated inter-avulsion periods in the study area range from 400 to 1300\u202fyr. The model results include a large number of failed\/partial avulsions, which is likely not the case for the observed data, as these reflect full avulsions only. Evidence of failed\/partial avulsions in the outcrop analog study tends to be obscured by the subsequent evolution of the system which includes expansion of the alluvial ridges and partial erosion of previous river paths. Comparative analysis between scenarios SL4 and SL5 shows that a potential increase in sediment load (i.e. scenario SL5) shifts avulsion recurrences to a higher-frequency domain.\n\n\n3.3\nAvulsion sequences\nAvulsions in the high sediment-load scenarios are organized in three sequences (Fig. 7). Each sequence groups a series of avulsion sites that shift progressively upstream with a concomitant decrease in avulsion periodicity. In the first stage, deposition is strongly progradational with predominantly bifurcation events occurring at the lacustrine delta edge and a few nodal and local avulsions. The gradual lengthening of the fluvial profile reduces equilibrium gradient and induces upstream aggradation which marks the initiation of a new avulsion sequence which drives depocenter shifts to adjacent regions partially onlapping onto older existing fluvial fans or toward a completely new course driven by regional avulsions. During the last stage, sediment is fed from random avulsions into the surrounding topographic lows while avoiding the previously formed alluvial ridges. Episodic peak discharge periods generate the sediment fluxes necessary to trigger the last stage as described above owing to excessive amounts of rainfall in the drainage area forcing rapid flooding events. This is supported by the analysis of remote sensing imagery over the period of 30\u202fyr which suggested that morphological changes at the terminus of the Altiplano system occur after peak discharge events (Li et al., 2018).\n\n\n3.4\nArchitecture of dryland fluvial successions\nVarious hypotheses, supported by morphodynamic modeling and field studies, gave new insights about the formation and architectural arrangement of channel-belt sediment bodies (Leeder, 1978; Bridge and Leeder, 1979; Mackey and Bridge, 1995; Kraus and Aslan, 1999; Mohrig et al., 2000; Gouw, 2007; Hajek et al., 2010; Wang and Plink-Bj\u00f6rklund, 2019). In this study, the spatial organization of the abandoned channel belts reflects the adjustment of active river tracts to the inherited (local) base level by compensational stacking (Sheets et al., 2002; Straub et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Hajek and Wolinsky, 2012; Edmonds et al., 2016). Over time, the initial single-thread channel gradually expands radially into multiple channels on account of continuous growth of alluvial ridges and avulsion-induced compensational stacking. The channel belts diverge over the unconfined floodplain area where reworking is less likely to occur. The resulting depositional architecture is a laterally extensive sheet with a fan-shaped top view and a convex-up shape, made up of radially arranged, connected sandy alluvial ridges (Fig. 10\n). Recent field research focusing on crevasse-splay architectural elements in the same area concluded that avulsion initiation is favored locally by alluvial-ridge development associated with compensational stacking of crevasse-splay deposits and channel-floor elevation above the floodplain (Van Toorenenburg et al., 2018; Donselaar et al., 2022).\n\n\n3.5\nPreservation of a terminal fluvial system\nOver the short term, the spatial variation in flow occupancy plays a key role in the sedimentation and preservation of the fluvial-fan channel deposits (Fig. 8). Long flow-occupancy periods in the proximal area correspond to low total aggradation because the conveyor belt constantly reworks and distributes sediment downstream (Fig. 8C). By contrast, higher abundance of channel-belt volumes is found across the medial to distal areas. This is consistent with previous experimental observations of channelized flows that occupy a particular route in the basin without filling it (Sheets et al., 2002; Ashworth et al., 2007; Van Dijk et al., 2009). Short-term sequestration and preservation run against common stratigraphic evidence which suggests that high relative volumes of channel deposits typically lie in the proximal sectors of fluvial-fan bodies. Therefore, we distinguish between topographic fluvial fans, which are fans defined by surface topography at some instance in time, and the final preserved fluvial fans in the stratigraphic record. Over the long term, the preservation of sediments of the terminal fluvial system is regulated by the regional subsidence pattern, and therefore periods of base-level rise (Miall, 1996). Under stable base-level conditions, the progradation of the terminal fluvial system may be translated into a fixed rise of base level across the entire coastal plain which induces aggradation upstream (Dalman et al., 2015). Additional accommodation may be provided by the higher compaction rates of floodplain fines relative to the coarser grain-size fraction. By contrast, intense floods may abruptly destroy accommodation and generate recognizable sedimentary signals in sink areas (i.e., storm intensity correlatable to mean grain size signature; Romans et al., 2016). Finally, in the case of a high-magnitude base level rise, low-stand fluvial fan deposits simply drown owing to enclosed basin conditions with minimal wave action and along-shore currents and are draped with lacustrine high-stand mud (De Jong et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nAn advection\u2013diffusion model of fluvial processes allowed us to analyze the following: (a) the role of river avulsions in geomorphological evolution, (b) the architectural arrangement of channel-belt sediment bodies, and (c) the preservation potential of terminal river systems. Geospatial and geochronological data from Rio Colorado Data enabled comparisons with the model output. The observed offset stacking of sediments in the river system is consistent with the high sediment-load model scenarios, which started with a single-thread channel, and in time expanded radially into multiple channels on account of progressive growth of alluvial ridges and avulsion-induced compensational stacking. The geomorphic end-product is a convex-upwards lobate topography with a thickness of a few meters, and abandoned channel deposits on either side of the main paleoflow axis that extends over 10\u202fkm in the proximal part, and 50\u202fkm in the distal part of the terminal river system. The modeled geomorphology shows a good comparison with the geomorphology in the upper and lower coastal plain of the Rio Colorado river system. The simulated avulsion periods of the high sediment-load scenario (180\u20131200\u202fyr) show a good match with the avulsion periodicity of 1.28\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.34\u202fkyr in the Rio Colorado river system.\nThe model output yielded three successive stages of river evolution, which determine the resultant landform in this study: (1) rapid river progradation with bifurcation events at the lacustrine delta edge, and a few nodal and local avulsions; (2) gradual lengthening of the fluvial profile, which reduces equilibrium gradient and induces upstream aggradation, and triggers new avulsions that result in depocenter shifts to adjacent low-lying regions; and (3) compensational stacking in topographic lows in between alluvial ridges by random local avulsions. The integrated approach of process-based modeling in combination with geospatial and geochronological data sets provides a large-scale framework for modeling studies of ancient fluvial stratigraphic units in which the radial extent of the fluvial system and the spatial organization of its isolated channel-belt sediment bodies are controlled by avulsion-induced compensational stacking.\n\n","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSeveral depositional landforms and sedimentary environments such as beaches, dunes, barriers, deltas, strandplains, backbarrier marshes, lagoons and tidal flats occur in the coastal system between the land and the sea worldwide (Buynevich et al., 2009) and have so far gained research attention in terms of their internal architecture (Lindhorst et al., 2008; da Silva et al., 2014; Fruergaard et al., 2018), evolution (Bristow et al., 2000; Hoffmann et al., 2005; Alappat et al., 2011; Gonz\u00e1lez-Villanueva et al., 2015) and age (Neudorf et al., 2015; Sander et al., 2015; Lamothe, 2016; Hart et al., 2017). Coastal landforms consist largely of sand, whose properties have been explored often, and especially as an archive of past storms and from a microscopy research perspective (Costa et al., 2009, 2014, 2015; Itamiya et al., 2019). This is because sand grains record specific conditions of the sedimentary environment (Mahaney et al., 2001), and thus serve as an excellent tool in palaeo-environmental reconstructions e.g. (Mycielska-Dowgia\u0142\u0142o and Woronko, 2004; Weckwerth et al., 2011; Weckwerth, 2018). Similarly, the Baltic Sea coast is rich in sands and combines the aforementioned landforms, which are particularly expressed in its southern and eastern coast as coastal planes and wide beaches (Jarmalavi\u010dius et al., 2012; \u0141abuz et al., 2018). So far, the main research interest here has been focused on, for example, coastal dune migration (Bor\u00f3wka, 1980; Bierstedt et al., 2017; Ludwig et al., 2017), Holocene sea-level changes (U\u015bcinowicz, 2006; Rosentau et al., 2013, 2021) and prehistoric coastal settlements (B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161 et al., 2016; Muru et al., 2018; Rosentau et al., 2020; Nirgi et al., 2020, 2022). In contrast, the coastal sand microscopy perspective is still unexplored along the Baltic Sea, except for a few studies of beaches in Finland and Sweden (Kali\u0144ska and Narti\u0161s, 2014; Kali\u0144ska-Narti\u0161a et al., 2017), coastal lake mineral particles in Latvia (Kali\u0144ska-Narti\u0161a et al., 2018) and the seabed and adjacent sediments in the Gulf of Gda\u0144sk, northern Poland (Passchier et al., 1997). Automatic grain shape imaging for thousands of sand grains has never been tested here also, although this method is in use for sediments representing many sedimentary environments (Campa\u00f1a et al., 2016; Varga et al., 2018; Szma\u0144da and Witkowski, 2021). Having this knowledge gap in mind, we explore three coastal locations in the southern coast of the Baltic Sea in Poland and Latvia, and we focus on their beach sediments at the microscale. We use a multiproxy approach to study sediment properties from sites located along three transects perpendicular to the sea coast using grain size and the shape and character of sand grain surfaces. We combine traditional binocular research methods on mineral sediment grains with novel automated grain image processing that allows the measurement of thousands of grains in a short time. Following this, and based on an advanced statistical approach, we aim to determine the character of the sediment, type of transportation and records of extreme events. Additionally, as the aim of our study, we propose a new textural code for beach sediments based on an automatically measured grain sphericity parameter and clustering algorithm to classify data into specific groups. Such an approach helps to determine beach evolution from immature and inherited grain outlines to long and homogeneous material transportation.\n\n\n2\nStudy area\n\n2.1. The Baltic Sea: general background\nThe last million years and several glacial episodes have influenced the morphology and sediments of the semi-closed Baltic Sea, which lies in a depression that was partially formed within the Baltic shield and the Precambrian Eastern\u2013European platform (Gudelis and Jemielianov, 1982). Its deepest parts in the palaeovalleys are filled with up to 300-m-thick Quaternary deposits, whereas some shallow areas have less than 5-m-thick coverage (Usaityte, 2000). Before the last glacial period, glaciogenic sediments were accumulated in the Baltic depression during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 (Obst et al., 2016) followed by the climatic shifts in the last glacial period (MIS 4\u20132) and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Holocene (Andr\u00e9n et al., 2011). These latter reveal the complex history related with advance and retreat of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and the glacial isostatic adjustment, which further resulted in phases with ice-dammed lakes (Baltic Ice Lake and Ancylus Lake) and marine phases (Yoldia Sea and Littorina Sea; for details, see Rosentau et al., 2021). The post-glacial history is related to long-shore currents transporting sediments from eroded cliffs and the development of wide beaches (\u0141abuz, 2013), which is also occurring nowadays (Lapinskis, 2017).\n\n\n2.2. Sampling sites\nIn this study, four sampling locations are considered (Figs. 1\u20133\n\n\n): in Stegna and Gdynia Or\u0142owo on the Polish coast (Fig. 2) and Ap\u0161uciems and L\u0101\u010dup\u012bte on the Latvian coast (Fig. 3). All these study sites belong to the southern and eastern coasts of the Baltic Sea (Figs. 1\u20133), which makes them comparable against each other from the perspectives of both location and geological situation. This means that the study sites lie in semi-closed gulfs rather than in the open Baltic Proper, and that they have quite similar geology, where coastal planes directly correspond with lowland plateaus. From a geomorphological perspective, the southern Baltic coast is straight-lined, with a combination of barrier-spits and cliffs occurring (Musielak et al., 2017). This is a result of accumulation and abrasion, which leads to the formation of coastal lowlands with current wave reworking (Gudelis and Jemielianov, 1982). These lowlands carry a set of ancient beach ridges later covered by dunes, which is the geological background at the Stegna (Fig. 2A), Ap\u0161uciems and L\u0101\u010dup\u012bte (Fig. 3A) sites. In contrast, the Gdynia Or\u0142owo site is related to cliffs (Fig. 2B), which are part of an adjacent moraine plateau. All in all, these sites contribute with brand-new data on beach sediment properties at a microscale.\n\n2.2.1. The Polish coast\nTwo beaches in Stegna and Gdynia Or\u0142owo sites are considered that represent the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea (Fig. 1). Both are located in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in Northern Poland and lie along the Gda\u0144sk Bay. The Stegna beach corresponds directly with the Vistula Spit, which is 118\u202fkm long and ends in the Kaliningrad Oblast, Western Russia. Here, the shallow Vistula Lagoon borders with the spit to the south, and the spit is generally considered to have developed in several stages between 5.86\u202fka and 5.4\u202fka, 1.93\u202fka and 1.61\u202fka, 1.2 and 0.9, and finally at ca 0.5\u202fka, according to thermoluminescence (TL) sediment dating (Fedorowicz et al., 2012). A newer study that combines optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating shows that the onset of the oldest dune formation began between 7\u202fka and 6\u202fka with the formation of the highest ridge between 4\u202fka and 2\u202fka followed by the development of the youngest dunes in the last 2000\u202fyears (U\u015bcinowicz et al., 2021).\nTwo components constitute the Stegna beach, and these are Holocene marine beach sands and aeolian sands. These latter build the coastal dunes to as high as ca 37\u202fm\u202fa.s.l., which are further termed as \u201cbrown\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d, corresponding to the oldest, medium and youngest (Fedorowicz et al., 2009).\nThe Gdynia Or\u0142owo beach lies in the central part of Gda\u0144sk Bay and in the city of Gdynia, which means it is influenced by pedestrian action and tourism and different than the Stegna and Ap\u0161uciems beaches. The beach corresponds directly with the Gdynia Or\u0142owo cliff, which further consists of southern, northern and headland parts. These parts differ from each other, which is visible through the occurrence of: fluvioglacial sands; gravels and silts; and glacial till combined with sand-gravelly sediments \u2013 in the southern, headland and northern parts, respectively (Wo\u017aniak et al., 2018).\nSince the character of sediments is controlled by their tectonic setting (Veizer and Mackenzie, 2014), we outline the Quaternary sediments of the Polish coast that range in thickness from 89 to 116\u202fm (Fedorowicz et al., 2009) and are mainly of marine and marine-fluvial origin. These sediments mainly overlie Cretaceous, Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene sediments: marls, sandstones with glauconite, quartzites and clays, respectively, which are located deeper (Mojski, 2005; Fedorowicz et al., 2009).\nBoth Polish localities are characterised by cooler summers and milder winters than other regions in Poland due to the sea influence, with average annual temperatures of 7.5\u202f\u00b0C and 7.8\u202f\u00b0C and precipitation of 621\u202fmm and 636\u202fmm (Stegna and Gdynia, respectively; Wo\u015b, 2010). The western wind sector (NW, W and SW) comprises ca 40\u201350% of total winds in the gulf (Kruk-Dowgia\u0142\u0142o and Szaniawska, 2008), and an average 2.2 storm surges per year with a maximum \u226570\u202fcm (Wolski and Wi\u015bniewski, 2020).\n\n\n2.2.2. The Latvian coast\nThe Ap\u0161uciems and L\u0101\u010dup\u012bte sites lie in south-west parts of the semi-closed Gulf of Riga (Fig. 1), ca 20\u202fkm north-west of the capital city of Riga in the Tukums municipality. The gulf itself is ca 100\u202fkm wide with an area of 19\u202fkm2 and maximum and average depths of 62\u202fm and 20\u202fm, respectively (Leivuori et al., 2000). The western part of the coast of the Gulf of Riga is more than 120\u202fkm long and is largely dominated by soft cliff faces formed by Quaternary deposits of mainly marine and aeolian or glacial origin (Zel\u010ds and Narti\u0161s, 2014). These sediments are bordered by Upper Devonian dolostones and siltstones (Dreimanis and K\u0101rklin, 1997). Such a setting makes the coast relatively low and mostly represented by a depositional plain formed during the Littorina Sea timeframe, with 20\u201350-m-wide sandy beaches, spits up to 1\u202fkm wide and parallel dune ridges accompanied by the former lagoon (Ulst, 1957; Eberhards and Brenners, 2010).\nThe climate in Latvia is characterised as intermediate between maritime and continental. The average annual temperature is +5.9\u202f\u00b0C (Sakipova et al., 2015) and annual total precipitation is 670\u202fmm (Lizuma et al., 2010). In the Gulf of Riga, the winds are anisotropic in nature \u2013 the angular distribution of strong winds has two peaks \u2013 one from SW and another from N\u2013NW (Soomere and Keevallik, 2001). This means that the eastern shores of the Gulf of Riga experience the largest storm surges in the eastern Baltic Sea (Averkiev and Klevanny, 2010) with an annual average of 46 episodes with a water level exceeding 30\u202fcm comparing with the Baltic Proper (M\u00e4nnikus et al., 2019). The average number of storm days in the southern Baltic Sea 13.41, which is much lower than the average of 41.9\u202fdays for the entire Baltic Sea (Formela and Marsz, 2011). P\u00e4rnu Bay, adjacent to the Latvian coast, experiences 8.4 storm surges per year with a maximum \u226570\u202fcm (Wolski and Wi\u015bniewski, 2020).\n\n\n\n\n3\nMaterial and methods\nSamples (22 in total) were collected from beaches in a perpendicular transect and included several parts, from the surfing zone to the backbeach close to the beach ridge and the cliff (Stegna: 10 samples; Ap\u0161uciems: 3 samples; Gdynia Or\u0142owo: 5 samples; Figs. 2C\u2013E, 3D, E; Table 1\n). Sediments of former beach ridges were also sampled in Stegna (Fig. 2D, samples 2.1\u20132.2) and L\u0101\u010dup\u012bte (4 samples) (Fig. 3C). Such combination of recent and former beach was to ensure a wide spectrum of different grain types for further analysis. If groundwater was present, both wet and dry layers were sampled, and this is relevant to the Stegna beach (for details, see Table 1). Material was room-dried and weighed, so that ca 150\u202fg of it was further subjected to dry sieving. The following set of sieves was used: 16.0, 8.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5, 0.250, 0.125, 0.063, 0.032\u202fmm and a pan. After dry sieving, all fractions were subsequently weighed with a precision of \u00b10.01\u202fg. The subsamples were substantially weighed, and results were inserted in the Gradistat 5.11 beta program, which allows the calculation of grain-size statistics by the Folk and Ward (1957) method. This latter was further presented as bi-plots including the grain mean diameter, and the standard deviation and skewness of grain-size distributions (Fig. 4A, B).\nThe 0.5\u20130.8-mm fraction was retained from the 0.5-mm sieve and treated by 10% HCl for 24\u202fh to remove any carbonates and then washed thoroughly to remove any clay remnants. After drying, a random portion of fraction was placed under the Zeiss Discovery V20 microscope (Laboratory of Environmental Analyses, Faculty of Earth Sciences and Spatial Management, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144). With a magnification between 10\u00d7 and 50\u00d7, the Cailleux (1942) analysis was applied with the modification of Mycielska-Dowgia\u0142\u0142o and Woronko (1998) to at least 100 quartz grains per sample. Seven grain groups were distinguished that provide information about the sedimentary environment as follows: (1) NU fresh grains with no visible transportation trails and chemical weathering (sharp grain edges), (2) C broken grains with at least 30% of the original grain cracked, (3) RM aeolian, well-rounded with matte surface across the whole grain surface, (4) EM\/RM aeolian, partially-rounded and matte only on the most convex parts of the grain, (5) EL high-energy aqueous environment, well rounded and shiny surface, (6) EM\/EL aqueous environment, partially-rounded, and (7) O others with intense precipitation of silica. In this method, Krumbein's (1941) grain shape chart is visually applied meaning that the 0.1\u20130.2, 0.3\u20130.6 and 0.7\u20130.9 scale from the chart refers to fresh, partially-rounded and well-rounded grains, respectively. Broken grains constitute a separate group in the chart (see for details Table 4 in Woronko et al., 2022).\nApart from this, the Microtrac MRB Camsizer M1 in the same laboratory was used for the 0.5\u20130.8\u202fmm fraction of the same sample set in order to automatically measure the shape distribution of the particles. The Camsizer M1 images particles of incoherent material in the range of 0.5\u202f\u03bcm to 2\u202fmm based on digital image processing, and it produces 54 particle parameters. However, in this study we emphasise the sphericity (SHPT) parameter, which is based on 3031 grains of 0.5\u20130.8-mm fraction (between 59 and 249 grains per sample; Fig. 6). This parameter was chosen because it is linked with grain elongation and helps to determine the sediment sources and duration of processes (Chmielowska et al., 2021). The SPHT is determined from the particle perimeter P and the particle area A and calculated for each grain by the formula as below, and describes perfect spheres with a value equal to 1.0:\n\n\nSPHT\n=\n\n\n4\n\u03c0A\n\n\nP\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Camsizer M1 works in a similar way to the Morphology G3SE, generating images and many parameters automatically. Some of the parameters have been described by Szma\u0144da and Witkowski (2021), who also analysed grain sphericity. They used parameters such as high sensitivity (HS), circularity, convexity, solidity and aspect ratio. These parameters are defined by the same equations considering both Camsizer M and Morphology G3SE but have different names (Szma\u0144da and Witkowski, 2021). The accuracy of the results (up to four decimal places) comes from statistical calculations. During these calculations we used the Statistica Ultimate v. 13.3 software to conduct a cluster analysis (joining \u2013 tree clustering) on (1) the grain types from the Cailleux analysis (Fig. 7), and (2) sphericity parameter from the Camsizer M1 picturing (Fig. 8) using the nearest-neighbour method and squared Euclidean distance as a partitioning method. To decide the optimum number of clusters, the critical value of squared Euclidean distance (dendrogram cut-off point; de Oliveira et al., 2019), which also ensures the samples bias, was found after the 19th stage in the clustering procedure for the grain types from the Cailleux analysis at the value of 160 squared Euclidean distance (cut-off 1; Fig. 7B). One more cut-off level (2) was additionally seen at 89 value of the distance after the 13th stage and was also considered. These values determine two cut-off levels that cross either four or ten vertical lines in the dendrogram (Fig. 7A).\nIn the joining (tree clustering) on the grain sphericity for 3031 grains, only one cut-off level was considered and set after step 3017 at the 0.01 value of squared Euclidean distance. This helped to distinguish nine groups that carry the closest values of the SPHT.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nGrain-size\nThe mean grain size revealed a wide range of values between 3.13 and \u22121.31 phi (0.114\u20132.487\u202fmm, respectively) with sample 2.1 being the finest and 2.15 being the coarsest. This means that the beach sediments are represented by fine-, medium- and coarse-grained sand combined with very fine gravel sediments in sample 2.15. This latter is additionally poorly sorted and positively skewed, and thus reflects the sediment mixing and dynamic conditions of the sedimentary environment energy in the waving zone of the Gdynia Or\u0142owo site. In contrast, several Latvian samples reveal the best sorting among the investigated beach samples, which indicates stable depositional conditions. The mean\u2013standard deviation biplot for all investigated samples looks quite scattered (Fig. 4A), but a pattern of more-or-less similar standard deviation values combined with changeable mean values can be spotted, and argues for not-so-changeable depositional environments according to Mycielska-Dowgia\u0142\u0142o and Ludwikowska-K\u0119dzia (2011). The slight increase in the mean with a lower sorting might also suggest a contradictory interpretation \u2013 that transport was changeable. All in all, the analysed grain-size parameters reveal limited changes in sediment transportation with episodes of high-energy events, i.e. storms. Yet, one biplot (Fig. 4B) considers the skewness values, which fall between \u22120.5 and 0.5, and with relatively good sorting for most of the investigated samples argue either for temporal erosion\/redeposition or for accumulation (negative and positive skewness values, respectively; Baraniecki and Racinowski, 1989, 1996). The outlier for 2.15 is a result of fine-fraction outwash due to increasing flow energy (sample 2.15), whereas rapid sediment deposition from suspension is revealed by poorer sorting in samples 2.2, 2.10 and 2.14 (Fig. 4B).\n\n\n4.2\nGrain roundness and grain surface\nCracked grains constitute decidedly the largest share in the investigated samples, at as much as 62% in the ancient beach ridge sample in Stegna (sample 2.1; Fig. 5\n). In places, this share is replaced by partially rounded shiny (EM\/EL) grains that seem to increase towards the sea, i.e. in the surf zone (samples 2.9, 2.10, 2.14 and 2.15). A similar share of this grain type is also seen in the ancient beach ridge sediments in Latvia (L\u0101\u010dup\u012bte site). Aeolian grains both short- (EM\/RM) and long- (RM) transported are also present and in places are about one third of the total grain share. Sample 2.7 from Stegna is exceptional in these terms, with only 8% of this grain type. Equally exceptional seems to be sample 2.13 from Gdynia Or\u0142owo, with the highest share of long-transported RM grains. Latvian beach grains seem visually better rounded that those observed along the Polish coast, and likely belong to the 0.6 roundness group in Krumbein's scale. Sediment maturity was also investigated, and two representative samples from beaches in Latvia and Poland (Stegna) were viewed for mineralogy. By carrying only 67% of quartz (and 23% and 10% of feldspar and lithics, respectively), the Ap\u0161uciems beach sediments seem immature, whereas 89% quartz grains (and only 6% of feldspar and 5% of lithics) found in the Stegna beach sand make it mature.\n\n\n4.3\nGrain sphericity\nGrain sphericity values presented as raw data constitute a dense point cloud, which is generally shifted towards the 1.0 value, meaning more spherical grains, and seems visually denser between the SPHT values of ca 0.7 and 0.97. In general, the SPHT distribution is wide and varies between 0.032 and 0.98, but the former value is relevant only for two measured grains along with two more grains with relatively low SPHT values. Otherwise, the lowest SPHT value is 0.48, meaning that this can be considered as the SPHT border value for the studied beach sediments. There is a clear shift of the SPHT values for grains representing Latvian beach samples (Ap\u0161uciems in Fig. 6\n). This shift reveals lower SPHT for the Latvian samples comparing with sediments sampled from the Polish coast. Several similar, but smaller, shifts towards lower SPHT values are also seen among Polish samples only \u2013 for example in the ancient beach ridge of the Stegna site (sample 2.1) followed by a few samples from Gdynia Or\u0142owo (samples 2.12 and 2.14). Visually, a large part of the SPHT point cloud from Stegna looks condensed, whereas larger scattering is observed for the Or\u0142owo and Latvian sites.\n\n\n4.4\nSample clustering\nThe joining (tree clustering) on all the percentage data of grain types from the Cailleux analysis at a cut-off of 160 reveals four sediment groups that carry the most similar grain features. These are: (1) a single-element group representing the stoss side berm in Gdynia Or\u0142owo (sample 2.13), (2) a single element group from the stoss side dry layer berm in Stegna (sample 2.7), (3) a single element from the Stegna ancient beach ridge, and finally (4) a multi-element group comprising the rest of the samples. Based on this, the 2.13 stoss side berm grains are the most distant on the plot, and thus they differ significantly from the rest of the samples, which is likely due to the more intense pedestrian traffic and sediment mixing. In contrast, grains from both the stoss side berm and ancient beach ridge in Stegna seem quite similar to each other. If the cut-off is lowered to 89 (Fig. 7B), several single-element groups are reflected along with one multi-element group. This former refers mostly to Latvian samples combined with the dry backbeach and surfing zone in Stegna. The latter multi-element group is about the samples with the most similar grains among the whole considered set. Apparently, this similarity is seen in all three study areas, both in the recent beaches and in the ancient coastal landforms, and both in high- and low-energy parts of the beach.\nClearly the statistical clustering analysis verifies the lowest sphericity value as seen from the raw data (Fig. 6) and discussed above, and raises the border SPHT lowest value up to 0.5138 (the lowest value in Table 2\n).\nAmong nine groups from the sphericity clustering (Fig. 8\n), three groups are represented only by 1\u20132 grains and thus were omitted from further considerations. This means that six groups are attained from the statistics and ordered from grains with the lowest to highest sphericity and named A to F, respectively. The intervals among them are: (1) A: 0.5138\u20130.6017, (2) B: 0.6098\u20130.6597, (3) C: 0.6715\u20130.7469; (4) D: 0.7576\u20130.8401, (5) E: 0.85\u20130.9227, and finally (6) F: 0.9228 and more (for details, see Table 2). The two groups with the most spherical grains (E and F) constitute more than 74% of total grain types in the investigated samples, whereas the most spherical grains from A group are only ca 1%. Groups A\u2013F are further calculated as a percentage share of each sphericity group and shown as pie charts for every sample (Fig. 9\n). This allows a visual percentage comparison and the introduction of the novel textural code that highlights two or three dominant sphericities (each of more-or-less equal contribution) sometimes combined with an accessory contribution of other grain types as provided in the brackets. The importance of the proposed code and its construction is provided in Section 5.2 and Table 3\n.\nThe textural types of beach sediments are based on the textural code, and if ordering them from most spherical and homogeneous grains to less spherical and heterogeneous beach grains, the following types are seen (Fig. 9; Table 4\n): (1) FE(D), (2) EFD, (3) EDF(C), (4) ED\/DE(F\/C), and (5) DE(C).\nThe FE(D) type comprises the most abundant and homogeneous samples, which reveal the highest sphericity. Sediments from the Stegna beach fall here almost exclusively, except for two less spherical samples, which represent the EDF(C) type. Three samples from Gdynia Or\u0142owo reveal most grains with sphericity >0.84, though a more-or-less equal share of E, F and D groups is seen (EFD type). Two types that include very mixed grain types (EDF(C) and ED\/DE(F\/C)) can be found both in several parts of the recent beach and in the beach ridge sediments. The Latvian beach sediments reveal the worse sphericity and represent the DE(C) type.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nIn sandy beach, the material is transported towards the land and back to the sea, namely swash and backswash, respectively (Evans, 1939). This means that mineral grains travel back-and-forth in the shore zone, but they may also be transported along the shore and deposited further inland (Calantoni et al., 2006). Once a storm surge comes, the beach is supplied with material, but dunes become abraded (Boyd et al., 1992). The Southern Baltic has mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and has been experiencing a combination of pseudo-monsoon air from the Atlantic Ocean and the European continent that further results in wind directions from the SW and W in the Baltic Proper and in gulfs and bays (Kostrzewski and Musielak, 2008). Apart from the natural processes, a considerable proportion of the coastline of many countries is developed with buildings and transportation routes, and thus bears little resemblance to the coast that formerly existed (Nordstrom, 1994).\n\n5.1\nQuartz grain roundness and surface versus beach parts, and related sedimentary processes\nWater-laden sediments representing fluvial, marine and beach environments affected by storms and tsunami events produce a number of quartz grains that differ in shape (Costa et al., 2012). Following this, the highest share of fresh and cracked quartz grains occurs in the beach sediments, and storm grains are quite similar with the latter of these. To distinguish this, some particular locations on the beach must be considered and combined with a multi-proxy study as recommended by Costa et al. (2012). One of these locations, where the sedimentary record of storms is expected, is the higher-located berm, which additionally marks the highest waves, and, by its size, storm intensity (Plant et al., 2014). As storm episodes repeat over time, the berm becomes a single form as a result of high-energetic waving and extreme water levels (Bendixen et al., 2013). In this way, the berm records multiple storm events that differ temporary and spatially, and may be considered a remnant of former environments (Otvos, 2000). This statement is supported by our study, where sediments taken from the berm itself (for example, sample 2.6 from the Stegna beach) carry an increased amount of well-rounded shiny (EL) quartz grains as compared with other localities. Their roundness might be inherited from the older littoral production and former berm sediment, since rounded grains are considered to be long-lasting in the cycle (Dott Jr, 2003; Kali\u0144ska-Narti\u0161a et al., 2017). Nevertheless, some single locations within the beach stand out for having the highest share of grains with cracking, which is seen through the Stegna sample 2.7 in the cluster analysis (Fig. 7). Following the earlier assumptions by Costa et al. (2012) about the fresh and cracked grains and combined with sample location next to the berm, one can conclude that sample 2.7 from Stegna records past storms.\nSimilarly, a very high proportion of cracked grains (ca 50% for sample 2.1, Fig. 5) is seen in the backside of the beach, and, considering the larger distance from the sea level under calm conditions, the storm must have also reached this more remote area and was likely stronger. Considering a storm wind with speeds of 60\u202fkm\/h, grains can be transported even to the back of the beach or even to the cliffs themselves and to coastal dikes (Udayaganesan et al., 2011). Several storms were recorded throughout this year and further classified as unusual and extreme phenomena in the southern Baltic coast (Kowalewska- Kalkowska, 2021). Such events are surely a direct cause of grains changing to the broken type and their transport over greater distances. Apart from this, grains from the backside of the beach are generally considered to be characterised by an increased proportion of aeolian grains that have been lifted from other landforms (mainly dunes) and mixed with beach sediments (Udayaganesan et al., 2011). This is the case of several backbeach samples from Stegna and Ap\u0161uciems, where an increased amount of aeolian grains is found in the dry part and beach ridge (ca 20% and 30%, respectively; Fig. 5).\nThe forebeach part of the coast is changeable (Wr\u00f3blewski, 2009), because waving occurs here from time to time and, depending on wave height and strength, this high-energy environment produces, for example, beach cusps (Antia, 1989). From the sediment-texture perspective, there is constant sediment mixing and rolling in this zone resulting in grain rounding and surface polishing (Kali\u0144ska-Narti\u0161a et al., 2017), combined with wave breaking and fresh grain surfaces (Costa et al., 2012). These processes were accompanied by short-term drier intervals when the wave returns towards the sea. It is said that the average mixing depth is ca 22% of significant wave height (Sherman and Lyons, 1994). For the southern Baltic Sea, the mixing depth is ca 10\u201320\u202fcm, meaning that mineral grains are mobilised from the immobile bed, resulting in a grain mixture as observed in Stegna and Ap\u0161uciems sediments through the multi-element group in the cluster analysis (Fig. 4).\nThe orbital-like movement occurs in the waving zone and results in saltating (finer sediment fractions) and rolling and dragging its coarser fraction (Kali\u0144ska-Narti\u0161a et al., 2017), which is seen in the odd grain-size properties of samples 2.10 and 2.15 (Fig. 4). The repetitive wave action additionally produces a moderate presence of percussion marks and fresh grain surfaces (Costa al., 2012), but a prevalence of rounded grains with shiny surface (for details, see Table 1 in Kali\u0144ska-Narti\u0161a et al., 2017). The rounded grains occur in the above-mentioned samples, and combined with their grain-size properties might be considered to be a record of intensive abrasive processes in a marine environment.\n\n\n5.2\nTextural properties coding for beach sandy sediments as an independent classification of beach evolutionary stages\nAccording to the results of sphericity measurements followed by its clustering, we proposed a universally applicable coding of grain shapes (considered here as textural facies coding) for beach sandy sediments. Such coding comprises a two-step procedure, referring to the independent results of (1) automatic SPHT measurements and (2) their statistical analysis. The texture-based classification of beach sandy sediments termed \u201ctextural facies\u201d is a novel and advanced approach that ultimately defines beach evolutionary stages. Such an approach seems to be applicable to characterise compositionally variable and mixed sandy sediments whose subtle textural variations (grain shape variation) hide the results of extreme geomorphic processes and factors controlling the beach depositional system. In some terms, our code might be comparable with the commonly used sediment textural classification scheme of Folk et al. (1970) for particle-size distribution, where an interplay among three main sediment fractions defines the sediment and helps to determine its deposition.\nHaving the percentage share of the A\u2013F sphericity groups for individual samples (Fig. 9), a two\u2013three main letter textural code can be constructed, sometimes with accessory letter(s) in brackets indicating additional contribution(s) (for details, see Table 3). The first letter in the code refers to the significant group that clearly dominates, with at least 40% of the share. In our study, the FE(D) type differs between 45% and 58% of F sphericity, so the letter F is located in the first position. The second code letter comes from the second significant group, having at least 25% of the share.\nWhen two groups seem to contribute nearly equally, this cannot be ignored, but a third significant group is considered if it has at least a 17% contribution. In this case, the code combines three letters (i.e. EFD) with the group that clearly dominates at the first position (E in this case) and two more-or-less equal groups in the second and third positions (F and D, respectively). Similarly, when the contribution of two groups is nearly equal and slightly changeable, a formulation such as DE\/ED is used rather than two separate textural types. The accessory contribution of a third or fourth occurrence group (in a two- or three-letter code, respectively) refers to contributions of up to 15% but not smaller than 1.7%. Again, if a nearly equal percentage share of accessory groups is observed, a combination of both, e.g. F\/C, is used.\n\n\n5.3\nProcess-linked sediment types inferred from grain sphericity coding\nA general assumption for the sphericity parameter is that more spherical sediment grains are generally considered as having experienced longer transport and more reworking cycles compared with those of lower sphericity value (Dann et al., 2010; Chmielowska et al., 2021). From the environmental perspective, perfect grain spheres seem relevant for aeolian transport, whereas elongated (meaning less spherical) grains are found to be indicative of fluvial and nearshore-setting transport (Suzuki et al., 2015). Nevertheless, sphericity differs in many terms from grain roundness, which reflects the variations in grain corners, edges and faces (Diepenbroek et al., 1992; Resentini et al., 2018). This means that rounded grains, understood as RM and EL in the Cailleux analysis, may carry either low or high sphericity values, and understanding these both cases may help in determining the true sedimentary settings (Chmielowska et al., 2021). Here we consider both parameters, and, based on this, long sediment transport can be distinguished from previously recycled (inherited) environments.\n\nChmielowska et al. (2021) found a high sphericity value that is bigger than 0.96 and 0.98 for RM and EL grains, respectively, meaning that, below these values, SPTH is low. This means that the F sphericity group distinguished in our study, with SPHT\u22650.9228, is closest to being termed \u201chigh spherical\u201d. However, overall, 6% and only 0.2% of grains of 0.96 and 0.98, (respectively) are found here. These high spherical grains fall likely in the FE(D) type, and, since the F group predominates in this type (Fig. 9), the high sphericity beach grain value can be set for over 0.9228 in our study. The FE(D) type predominates on Stegna beach, which means that transportation processes must have been both long and homogeneous (Table 4). The orbital wave movement seems to have produced high-spherical grains here (sample 2.10), but this is not the case in the Gdynia Or\u0142owo surf zone (the EDF(C) type; sample 2.15), where coarse sediments (Fig. 4) are dragged rather than saltated. In the FE(D) types, an exception is the stoss side berm (sample 2.7; EDF(C) type; Fig. 9) which has the lowest sphericity for Stegna (SPHT\u202f=\u202f0.86). This relatively low sphericity value further supports the sample's previous recognition as a storm record by Cailleux analysis (see also below).\nSome limited sediment reworking and medium transport duration is reflected in the sediments in Gdynia Or\u0142owo, where slightly less spherical grains as represented by the EFD type and are combined with the EDF(C) type (Table 4). Since this latter carries more-or-less equal shares of E, D and F sphericity groups, it may correspond with more-or-less equal shares of EM\/RM, EM\/EL and C grains, thus supporting sediment mixing in most samples. There are several explanations for this; one relates to a recreational pathway along the beach (Marek and Olszak, 2020), but the complex geology of the cliff is also considered.\nFinally, isometric grains with angular shape and low values of circularity (which is the square root of the sphericity according to the Camziser M1 manual, and circularity values thus equal sphericity) refer to glacial, weathering and high-energy environmental settings, where transportation is neglected (Chmielowska et al., 2021). According to Joo et al. (2018), a circularity parameter of around 0.7 and not larger than 0.8 characterises glacial deposits under humid climate conditions in Norway. This interval partially overlaps with the C and D groups in our study (cf. Table 2) and seems most relevant to the sample set described as DE(C) type (Fig. 9), because this is the only one set where group D (SPHT\u202f=\u202f0.7576\u20130.8401) prevails. Based on the above, grains with the lowest sphericity values (between 0.79 and 0.82) occur in the Latvian beach sediment (samples 2.16 and 2.18) and ancient beach ridge sediments (sample 2.22) and record incidental storm events. Storm surges seem more frequent in the eastern Baltic than in the vicinity of Gda\u0144sk (see Table 2 in Wolski and Wi\u015bniewski, 2020), which might at least partially explain the more extreme transport record in Latvia.\nRegardless their relatively poor sphericity values, Latvian beach grains seem to be visually better rounded both for shiny and matte outline (see Results). In the case of good roundness and weak grain sphericity, the grain shape reflects the primacy of transport duration and sediment maturity less than expected but, rather, is inherited from other environments (Chmielowska et al., 2021). Devonian bedrock grains might explain this in the Latvian locality, since some pre-Quaternary formations are rich in already recycled and reworked grains (Kleesment, 2009).\nAll in all, the investigated beach sediments reveal different stages of beach evolution as starting from nearly transport-less rapid storm deposition and grain inheritance from older environments in Latvia, limited sediment transportation and mixing in Gdynia Or\u0142owo and ancient beach ridges in Stegna and Latvia, and ending with long-lasting and homogeneous transport and mature sediments in Stegna beach. Homogeneous sediment transport means that sediments are transported for a long time and in the same way (e.g., sea waves or wind) without disturbances such as storm episodes.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study considers recent and ancient beach sediments from four locations along the southern and eastern Baltic Sea, where the grain-size, character of sand grains surface and their shape under traditional and automated grain imaging methods are applied. The latter provides robust and objective insight in the sediment grain characteristics. The multiproxy study is combined with statistical methods and serves as an excellent tool in revealing extraordinary and sedimentary-process-linked properties of the beach sediment grains that have been unnoticed whilst using traditional methods. This allows us to draw the following conclusions.\n\n\u2013\nThe storm record is found easily on some mineral grains that usually reveal more than 50% of cracked outlines and thus stand out in the statistical clustering.\n\n\n\u2013\nA sphericity parameter (SPHT) value of around 0.8 can be considered as a mark of past storminess and is particularly seen both in recent and ancient beach sediments in Latvia. Whilst combining with an increased number of cracked grains, this is one more piece of evidence for an intense wave event.\n\n\n\u2013\nA threshold value of 0.9228 represents high grain sphericity as seen in long-transported, homogeneous and mature beach sediments.\n\n\n\u2013\nThe sphericity-based textural coding is proposed to state whether the beach has experienced multicycle sediment reworking and long transport duration (i.e. Stegna beach) or, conversely, its grains are inherited from other environments(i.e. Ap\u0161uciems beach).\n\n\n\n\n","41":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nA massive emission of light carbon into the atmosphere and oceans about 56\u202fMa caused a ~170 kyr long episode of intense global warming known as the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The hyperthermal event, recorded in marine and terrestrial sedimentary archives by a negative carbon isotope excursion, is widely considered an ancient analogue of the ongoing anthropogenic warming of the Earth (Thomas and Zachos, 2000; Sluijs et al., 2007; Zachos et al., 2008; McInerney and Wing, 2011; Alley, 2016; Tierney et al., 2020).\nOne of the effects of the PETM was an alteration of the global hydrological cycle. Both geological proxy data and model simulations have shown that the hydrological changes varied geographically, producing aridification in some areas but greater precipitation in others (e.g., Carmichael et al., 2017; Lunt et al., 2017). The latter resulted in increased influx of terrestrial clastics into widely separated shallow marine shelves and continental margins (e.g., Gibson et al., 2000; Schmitz et al., 2001; John et al., 2008; Slotnick et al., 2012; Pujalte et al., 2015, 2016, 2019; Pujalte and Schmitz, 2019; Jiang et al., 2021). Terrestrial sedimentary archives, despite being less extensive than marine records, have a higher sensitivity to hydrological changes, as variations in rainfall in catchment areas rapidly modify the pattern of river flows and the features of their deposits (Cecil and Dulong, 2003). For instance, in the Piceance Creek Basin of Colorado, in the Uinta Basin of Utah and in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico (USA), abrupt alterations in the architecture of fluvial deposits during the PETM are attributed to a coeval hydroclimate change (Foreman et al., 2012; Foreman, 2014; Plink-Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 2014; Zellman et al., 2020).\nThe PETM is represented in the Tremp-Graus Basin (southern Pyrenees, Spain) by three terrestrial units, the Claret Conglomerate, the Yellowish Soils, and the Gypsum-rich Unit. The Claret Conglomerate is a sheet-like extensive unit 0.5\u20137\u202fm thick, first described by Schmitz and Pujalte (2007), that has been used by several authors to infer the effects of the PETM hydrological change (e.g., Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007; Pancost, 2017; Armitage et al., 2011, 2013; Carmichael et al., 2017, 2018; Colombera et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018). However, the precise depositional setting of the Claret Conglomerate is still somewhat controversial, as both megafan and braided fluvial models have been considered (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007; Colombera et al., 2017). The Yellowish Soils are up to 20\u202fm thick and mostly made up of silty calcareous clays with intercalated calcarenites. The Gypsum-rich Unit is up to 10\u202fm thick and, as implied by its name, contains abundant gypsum deposits. Although the contrasting lithological character of these three units intuitively suggests a sequence of hydroclimatic changes during the PETM, this possibility has received little attention to date.\nThe purpose of this paper is to establish the depositional conditions of the three constituent units of the PETM in the Tremp-Graus Basin, a crucial information to assess properly the impact of hydrological changes associated to the hyperthermal event. New field studies were conducted in two sectors of the Tremp-Graus Basin, Esplugafreda and Claret, which respectively correspond to the most proximal and distal outcrops available for the target units. The former sector is located on the southern margin of the Esplugafreda ravine and provides a ~3\u202fkm long near-continuous exposure of the entire Tremp Group. The latter sector is situated around the Claret hamlet, about 2.5\u202fkm to the southwest of the city of Tremp (Fig. 1\n). Prior data of Schmitz and Pujalte (2007) and Pujalte et al. (2014) from other nearby sections (e.g., Berganuy, Iscles, Serraduy) have also been taken into account.\nModel predictions of the response of Earth's climate to anthropogenic carbon emissions suggest an intensified hydrological cycle in arid to semiarid mid-latitude regions. Assuming the similarity between the PETM and the anthropogenic warming, our empirical observations can be crucial in calibrating model simulations of precipitation patterns and the sedimentary response in Earth's future greenhouse world.\n\n\n2\nSetting and previous information\n\n2.1\nPalaeogeography\nDuring the Paleocene\u2013Eocene boundary interval the Tremp-Graus Basin was located at ~35\u00b0N palaeolatitude, on the southeastern margin of an E\u2013W elongated marine embayment surrounded by coastal alluvial plains (Fig. 1A) (Plaziat, 1981; Baceta et al., 2011). The basin was created and transported piggy-back on top of a thrust sheet during a Santonian\u2212Maastrichtian interval of compressional tectonism (Burbank et al., 1992; Ard\u00e8vol et al., 2000; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012; Chanvry et al., 2018). During the tectonically quiescent late Maastrichtian\u2212earliest Ypresian interval the basin had a steep northern margin on the forelimb of the Nogueres thrust and a gentle southern margin on the backlimb of the Montsec thrust (Fig. 1B). During the main compressional Ypresian\u2212Oligocene interval, the basin was deformed, uplifted, and most of its northern part eroded away (Teixell and Mu\u00f1oz, 2000).\n\n\n2.2\nStratigraphy\nThe eastern part of the Tremp-Graus Basin was mostly infilled with terrestrial clastic deposits, informally named \u201cGarumnian\u201d (Rosell et al., 2001) and formally Tremp Group (Puigdefabregas et al., 1989; Cuevas, 1992; Dreyer, 1993; Pujalte and Schmitz, 2005; Pujalte et al., 2014). These terrestrial deposits overlie the transitional Aren Sandstone Formation (Maastrichtian), are overlain by the shallow marine \u201cAlveolina limestone\u201d (lower Ypresian), and interfinger to the west with lacustrine and shallow marine carbonates (Fig. 1C) (Serra-Kiel et al., 1994; Pujalte et al., 2014). In the two studied sectors the Thanetian to lowermost Ypresian interval comprises two lithostratigraphic units, the Esplugafreda and Claret formations (Figs. 2, 3A, B) (Cuevas, 1992; Dreyer, 1993; Pujalte and Schmitz, 2005; Pujalte et al., 2014)\n.\nThe Esplugafreda Formation (Thanetian) is ~165\u202fm thick at Esplugafreda and ~350\u202fm thick at Claret. In both sectors the unit is mostly made up of overbank red silty marls with intercalated channels infilled with calcareous conglomerates and calcarenites (Fig. 2A, D). The channels occur either isolated or in laterally connected strings, in both cases successive channels occupying slightly higher stratigraphic positions (Fig. 3B). At Esplugafreda the red marls contain Microcodium (submillimetre-sized monocrystalline prisms of calcite originated on roots of terrestrial plants; Klappa, 1978, 1980; Ko\u0161ir, 2004; Kabanov et al., 2008), gypsum horizons and abundant palaeosol carbonate nodules, 1.5\u20133\u202fcm in diameter, usually concentrated in discrete palaeosol horizons. (Fig. 2A, C). Carbonate nodules are less abundant at Claret but gypsum is widespread, including accumulations up to 10\u202fm thick, deposited in saline lakes or continental sabkhas (Garc\u00eda Veigas, 1997).\nThe Claret Formation contains five successive members (Fig. 2A, B), briefly described below from older to younger. Member 1 comprises the deposits infilling several incised valleys, 1\u20131.5\u202fkm wide and 20\u201330\u202fm deep, excavated during a lowstand period predating the PETM. These valleys, which are floored by calcareous conglomerates and coarse-grained pebbly calcarenites, were mostly filled-up by pale red marls with sparse carbonate nodules at Esplugafreda and by light grey calcarenites and marlstones rich in coal remains at Claret (Pujalte et al., 2014, 2022).\nMember 2, the Claret Conglomerate, is an extensive sheet-like unit, 0.5\u20137\u202fm thick, of clast-supported calcareous conglomerates, pebbly calcarenites and minor marls (Figs. 2D, 3A, B; Supplementary Fig. 1). The genesis of sheet-like clastic accumulations is commonly attributed to a reduction in accommodation space during tectonically quiescent intervals (e.g., Heller and Paola, 1989). Although tectonic conditions in the Tremp-Graus Basin were quiescent during the entire late Maastrichtian\u2212early Ypresian interval (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012), only the Claret Conglomerate shows sheet-like geometry. Hence, Schmitz and Pujalte (2007) attributed the development of the Claret Conglomerate to an abrupt increase of clastic supply caused by the PETM hydrologic change.\nMember 3, the Yellowish Soil unit, is up to 20\u202fm thick and mainly consists of silty marls with occasional intercalations of calcarenites. In weathered outcrops, the lower part of the silty marls has a yellow-orange colour, which up section becomes increasingly lighter (Fig. 2A, B). Neither Microcodium nor gypsum have been observed, but the marls contain abundant small-sized (0.5\u20131\u202fcm) palaeosol carbonate nodules dispersed throughout the unit (Fig. 2A, C).\nMember 4, the Gypsum-rich Unit, is represented at Esplugafreda by deep-red marls that include numerous gypsum crystals and veins (Fig. 3C), and at Claret by a massive package of alabastrine gypsum up to 4\u202fm thick (Fig. 3D). Neither conglomerates nor calcarenites have been observed in any outcrop of the unit.\nMember 5, the upper red unit, only exists at Esplugafreda, where it is up to 17\u202fm thick and comprises light red marls with dispersed carbonate nodules and occasional Microcodium. The overlying \u201cAlveolina limestone\u201d is a time-transgressive marine unit, which onlaps member 4 at Claret and member 5 at Esplugafreda (Fig. 2A).\n\n\n2.3\nThe PETM in the Tremp-Graus Basin\nThe PETM was first constrained in the Tremp-Graus Basin with \u03b413C isotopes from palaeosol carbonate nodules of the Esplugafreda Formation, the incised valley fill, the Yellowish Soils and the upper red unit (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2003). Later, carbonate nodules were also found in red marls intercalated within the Claret Conglomerate, which produced \u03b413C values intermediate between those of the Esplugafreda Formation\/incised valley fill and the Yellowish Soils (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007). These data showed that the bulk of the Esplugafreda Formation and the incised valley fill deposits predate the PETM, the Claret Conglomerate and the Yellowish Soils encompass the onset and core of the hyperthermal event, respectively, and the Gypsum-rich Unit records the recovery to background conditions (Fig. 2A). Subsequent \u03b413C isotope studies of bulk dispersed organic carbon essentially agree with that conclusion (Domingo et al., 2009; Manners et al., 2013; Pujalte et al., 2022).\nMeasurements of cross stratifications, clast imbrication, and sole marks by Dreyer (1993) and Colombera et al. (2017) at the Esplugafreda sector indicate southward and southwestward palaeocurrents, an evidence that the E-W Esplugafreda outcrop provides a near strike view of the Thanetian\u2212lower Ypresian terrestrial succession. Puigdefabregas et al. (1989) and Dreyer (1993) interpreted this entire succession as fluviatile, ascribing the vertical variations in the proportion of conglomerates to changing tectonic conditions. Schmitz and Pujalte (2007) considered that the Claret Conglomerate represents the extensive braidplain of a megafan caused by an abrupt increase in clastic supply during episodic high-energy rainstorms, severe floods and greater avulsion frequency related to enhanced seasonality during the PETM onset. Instead, Colombera et al. (2017) attributed the differences between the Claret Conglomerate and the underlying deposits to the development of a braided fluvial network (Fig. 2D), an interpretation that will be discussed below.\n\nKiehl et al. (2018) modelled the climatic conditions of the Pyrenees in pre-PETM and PETM times using the Community Climate System Model framework, and compared their results with published proxy data from the area. They concluded that the Pyrenees experienced enhanced seasonal amplitude in surface air temperature during the PETM, which produced increased summer warming by 8\u202f\u00b0C. As a consequence, summer evaporation also increased, causing excessive drying from June to August. Seasonal precipitation increased by 50\u2013200%, maximum increase in rainfall occurring from October to January. However, if maximum orbital forcing was also considered, the largest increase in run-off was modelled in August, September and October.\n\nChen et al. (2018), also based on data from the Esplugafreda sector, calculated that water discharge increased between 1.35 and 14 times during the formation of the Claret Conglomerate. For their calculation, they measured the b-axes of more than 5000 clasts, the depth and width of 48 channels from the Esplugafreda Formation, the incised valley deposits and the Claret Conglomerate, and took into account data of channel dimensions from Dreyer (1993) and Colombera et al. (2017). They found that the 50th percentile (D50) of clast size distributions in pre-PETM deposits was 21.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202fmm, slightly diminishing to 19.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f4\u202fmm in the Claret Conglomerate. As per channel dimensions, it should be noted that the only \u201cClaret Conglomerate channels\u201d illustrated by these authors, in their supplementary Fig. 2, are from line drawings reproduced from Dreyer (1993). These channels, however, do not belong to the Claret Conglomerate, but to the basal conglomeratic deposits of one of the incised valleys (Supplementary Fig. 2), an error that casts doubt on the accuracy of their calculations.\n\n\n\n3\nMaterial and methods\nThis study is chiefly based on fieldwork focused on the Claret Conglomerate, the Yellowish Soils and the Gypsum-rich Unit. For the study of the Claret Conglomerate our emphasis was placed on the large-scale geometries of coarse-grained deposits, instead of focusing only on clast sizes, sedimentary structures, barforms or dimensions of individual channels. Thus, the entire ~3\u202fkm long outcrop of the Claret Conglomerate in the Esplugafreda sector was walked along and its best-exposed segments mapped and measured in detail. As a result, laterally continuous tracks of the unit, up to 350\u202fm wide and plausibly having palaeogeomorphic significance, were differentiated. These tracts are here named \u201cArchitectural Ensembles\u201d (AE), because their main distinctive features are thickness and internal sedimentary geometries (Fig. 4\n). The size of the largest clasts was routinely measured in most outcrops. Photomosaics and Google Earth images were used to map large-scale differences between the Claret Conglomerate and the coarse-grained clastic units of the underlying deposits (Fig. 3A, B; Supplementary Fig. 2).\nThe same approach could not be applied in the Claret sector, as several segments of the Claret Conglomerate are inaccessible or poorly exposed. However, field mapping of selected outcrops in strike and dip sections permitted a reasonably accurate reconstruction of the architecture of the unit in this sector. Palaeocurrents at Claret were determined from clast imbrications and cross-stratifications.\nThe Yellowish Soils and the Gypsum-rich units are not as well exposed as the Claret Conglomerate, often being overgrown with vegetation due to their predominantly fine-grained lithology. For this study, their best outcrops were carefully mapped in both studied sectors. Special attention was paid to the character of the calcarenites intercalated in the silty marls of the Yellowish Soils and to the stratigraphic relationships between the Yellowish Soils and the Claret Conglomerate. In addition, given that palaeosol colour can have compositional significance (Eppes and Johnson, 2022), four samples were collected from the silty marls of the Yellowish Soils, homogeneously distributed in ascending stratigraphic order. The samples were ground to powder using an agate mortar and stored in transparent, antiglare prismatic vials. The colour of the powder samples was visually determined following the Munsell system of hue, value and chroma, using a standard rock-colour chart (Munsell Color, 2009). These determinations were further verified using colour analysis software. To this end, the powder vials were scanned at high resolution (600 dpi) using a desktop office scanner in a dark room. Eight RGB measurements were made on each sample and mean RGB values were converted into the corresponding Munsell colour keys using available calibration tables (Centore, 2013).\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nEsplugafreda sector\n\n4.1.1\nClaret Conglomerate\nThe features of the Claret Conglomerate at Esplugafreda and neighbouring outcrops change laterally. Its thickness, for instance, decreases from about 7\u202fm near the Gurp and Esplugafreda hamlets to about 2\u202fm just to the east of the Noguera-Ribagorzana River (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). To the west of this river, the thickness of the unit increases to about 8\u202fm at the Berganuy pass and then diminishes again, eventually pinching-out near the abandoned Iscles hamlet (Supplementary Fig. 1B, D). The Claret Conglomerate reappears near the Serraduy village, further west decreasing in thickness and becoming discontinuous (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. 1E). Both in the Serraduy and Berganuy pass areas, the base of the Claret Conglomerate is essentially flat and its top slightly convex-up, an observation extrapolated to the entire unit to explain its lateral thickness variations (Supplementary Fig. 1B, C).\nThe deposits of the Claret Conglomerate are generally clast-supported, ungraded or with poorly defined inverse grading (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). However, stacked, decimetre-scale cycles of conglomerates grading up into calcarenites also occur (Supplementary Fig. 3C). The nature and size of the clasts also vary laterally. Thus, along the Esplugafreda outcrop grey clasts are predominant, probably derived from upper Cretaceous carbonates, and clast diameters larger than 20\u202fcm are rare. Conversely, in the Berganuy pass section clasts with 30\u201360\u202fcm long axes are common, some of them reaching ca. 80\u202fcm (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4B). Their lithologies are also more varied as, in addition to upper Cretaceous grey carbonates, lower Cretaceous orbitolinid-rich clasts and reddened Maastrichtian clasts are also common. These changes indicate that the Claret Conglomerate was fed through several source points, as implied in Fig. 1D of Schmitz and Pujalte (2007) and explicitly stated by Colombera et al. (2017). The detailed analysis of the Esplugafreda outcrop carried out in this study has revealed other lateral variations in the Claret Conglomerate, based on which five different architectural ensembles (AE) have been differentiated (Figs. 3A, 4), their main features being described below from east to west.\nAE-1 comprises several exposures along a ~300\u202fm wide tract in the easternmost part of the Esplugafreda valley (Fig. 3A). The Claret Conglomerate is 6\u20137\u202fm thick in this ensemble (Figs. 4, 5\n) and mostly composed of stacked packages, a few meters wide and about 1\u202fm thick, of conglomerates bounded by concave-up, cross-cutting erosional surfaces (Fig. 5B, C). The conglomerates lack grading, segregation or other internal organization, the long axes of their clasts being up to 20\u202fcm, but generally smaller. Some shallow scours are infilled with calcarenites and dark-grey marls rich in plant remains (Fig. 4). Large-scale cross-strata inclined nearly perpendicular to the south-directed palaeocurrents are visible in one of the outcrops (Fig. 5D).\nAE-2 is continuously exposed for about 280\u202fm to the east and west of an unnamed ravine (Figs. 3A, 6A). The ensemble is up to 4.6\u202fm thick and consists of conglomerates and calcarenites arranged in laterally accreted, low angle inclined strata separated by thin mudstone partings (Fig. 4). Notably, lateral accretion is oriented in opposite directions on each side of the ensemble, to the east on the eastern flank (Fig. 6B) and to the west on the western side (Fig. 6C). The thickness of individual strata varies laterally, some of them ending in gross bulges of cross-bedded conglomerates and pebbly sandstones, their palaeocurrents being concurrent with the direction of accretion (Fig. 6D, E). A channel-like depression about 10\u202fm wide and 3\u202fm deep separates both flanks (Fig. 4).\nAE-3 is the only ensemble in which individual channels can be clearly delineated, as they are partly encased in marls (Figs. 4, 7\n). It contains three channels infilled with conglomerates, calcarenites and minor marls. Width\/depth dimensions are 23\/4.5\u202fm in channel 1 and about 50\/3\u202fm in channels 2 and 3. Channel 3 is located between the other two, partly overlapping them (Fig. 7A). To the east and west of the channels, the ensemble is \u22642\u202fm thick and has a tabular shape (Figs. 4, 7A).\nAE-4, which is more than 350\u202fm wide, is exposed across the Les Comes creek, a side-valley of the Esplugafreda ravine (Fig. 3A). The thickness, lithology and morphology of the ensemble change laterally (Figs. 4, 8\n). Thus, at reference points P1 and P2 in Fig. 8A the Claret Conglomerate is about 3\u202fm thick and mostly made up of conglomerates, its thickness slightly declining to the east and west of both points (Fig. 4). However, between these two points the Claret Conglomerate has a smaller thickness, so that a sort of topographic depression about 200\u202fm wide is recognized (Fig. 8A). On the western side of the depression the decrease in thickness is gradual, and different zones are recognizable. In effect, between points P2 and P3 the Claret Conglomerate is still mostly composed of conglomerates that have a flat base and an undulating top, its thickness varying from up to 2\u202fm in the crests to less than 0.6\u202fm in the inter-crest lows (Fig. 8B). The thickness of the Claret Conglomerate further decreases to about 1\u202fm between points P3 and P4, where the unit is made up of conglomerates and pebbly calcarenites arranged in laterally accreted, low-angle inclined strata, and diminishes to a minimum of ~0.5\u202fm between points P4 and P5 (Fig. 8C). In contrast, just west of reference point P1, on the eastern side of the depression, the thickness of the Claret Conglomerate rapidly diminishes from 3 to 1.5\u202fm along a near straight line striking NNE\u2013SSW, creating a smooth cliff (Fig. 8D, E, Supplementary Fig. 4A).\nAE-5, which is situated in the western part of the Esplugafreda outcrop, is about 280\u202fm wide and mostly overlies incised valley deposits (Figs. 3A, 9A). It is mainly composed of near tabular conglomerates 2\u20132.5\u202fm thick (Fig. 4) that, in parts of the ensemble, exhibit a sort of lateral accretion arrangement in which successive strata terminate abruptly against the underlying incised valley deposits (Fig. 9B). The most distinctive feature of the ensemble, however, is an erosional depression about 150\u202fm wide situated in its central part, within which the Claret Conglomerate has been completely removed, so that Yellowish Soil calcarenites rest directly on the incised valley deposits (Fig. 9A, C).\n\n\n4.1.2\nYellowish Soils\nIn most of the Esplugafreda and Berganuy pass sectors the Claret Conglomerate is directly overlain by friable silty marls (i.e., the Yellowish Soils), which have been partly removed by recent erosion. As a result, the top of the Claret Conglomerate is widely exposed at several places as a sharp surface with a gentle convex-up geometry (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B).\nDespite the distinctive colour of the Yellowish Soils, the silty marls show different shades of yellow at different stratigraphic levels, as they progressively become lighter coloured upsection (Figs. 2B, 6B). Using the Munsell colour key, the lower half of the Yellowish Soils shows yellowish grey (5Y 7\/2) and moderate yellowish brown (10YR 5\/4) colours, whereas the upper part shows greyish orange (10YR 7\/4) to pale yellowish orange (10YR 8\/6) colours (Supplementary Fig. 5). These determinations show that the Yellowish Soils are characterized by progressively higher chroma upsection.\nLocally, the Yellowish Soils also contain calcarenite beds, which rest directly either on the Claret Conglomerate or, exceptionally, on incised valley deposits. The architecture of these calcarenites is markedly different from that of the Claret Conglomerate, the best examples occurring within the central erosional depression of AE-5. In most of this depression alternating fine and medium-grained calcarenites conform a single cross bedded set about 3\u202fm thick, its westward direction being almost perpendicular to the mean palaeocurrents of the Claret Conglomerate (Figs. 9C, 10A). In the westernmost part of the depression, however, this laterally accreted set is almost solely composed of medium-grained calcarenites. A fining-upward arrangement is also evident, with medium-grained calcarenites, which downlap the basal erosional surface of the depression, grading up into fine-grained calcarenites and, eventually, into yellow silty marls (Fig. 10A).\nCalcarenites also exist in the Yellowish Soils that filled the western part of the AE-4 central depression. Their arrangement, however, is somewhat more complex than in the AE-5 example, perhaps because they were deposited on the undulating top of the Claret Conglomerate (Supplementary Fig. 6). Other examples of alternating fine and medium-grained calcarenites have been observed directly on top of the Claret Conglomerate in parts of AE-1 and AE-2. Neither exposure is good, as the finer-grained calcarenites are largely covered by vegetation. The medium-grained calcarenites, however, are reasonably well exposed, their fining-up arrangement and low-angle inclined geometry, indicative of lateral accretion, being distinctly perceived (Fig. 10B, C).\n\n\n\n4.2\nClaret sector\n\n4.2.1\nClaret Conglomerate\nOnly one relatively large outcrop of the Claret Conglomerate occurs in the Claret sector. It is situated around the Claret hamlet, erosively overlying the grey calcarenites and marls of the incised valley fill (Fig. 11A). This outcrop is about 1.5\u202fkm long in N\u202f\u2212\u202fS direction, reaching a maximum thickness of about 4\u202fm in its central part and progressively decreasing to ~1\u202fm in the Palau and Ricos creeks, eventually pinching out a little further to the north and south. In the Claret road section, imbrication in basal conglomerates of the incised valley deposits and cross-stratifications in the Claret Conglomerate indicate WSW-directed palaeocurrents (Pujalte et al., 2022) (Fig. 11A). The close parallelism between the palaeocurrents of these two units can also be clearly perceived in the three-dimensional exposure created by the Palau creek (Fig. 11B), where both units display large-scale trough cross-bedding. In both units, in effect, foresets indicative of west-directed currents occur in the northern and southern margins of the creek (Fig. 11C, E), while cross-cutting scoop shaped erosional surfaces are visible in the N\u2013S oriented outcrop within the creek itself (Fig. 11D). The areal coincidence of the outcrops of both units and their near identical palaeocurrents, strongly suggest that the incised valley was not entirely fill-up before the onset of the PETM and acted as a trap for the gravels of the Claret Conglomerate.\nThe remainder outcrops of the Claret Conglomerate in the Claret sector are discontinuous and always overlie directly the Esplugafreda Formation. All of them are of modest dimensions, the largest one, situated on the southern margin of the St Adria valley, being about 170\u202fm wide and up to 2\u202fm thick (Figs. 11A, 12A).\n\n\n4.2.2\nYellowish Soils\nAs in Esplugafreda, in the Claret sector the Yellowish Soils are mainly composed of silty marls, which show progressively lighter colours upsection, interspersed with some intercalated calcarenites, of which two types are recognized, channelized and unchannelized, (Fig. 12). The best example of the channelized type, located on the southern margin of the St Adria valley (Fig. 11A), is up to 5\u202fm thick and about 50\u202fm wide. It is mainly composed of 5\u201315\u202fcm thick calcarenites separated by thin marly interbeds that abut on a concave-up lower surface (Fig. 12B, C). These calcarenites are arranged in several stacked packages, each of them having a low-angle inclination indicative of lateral accretion (Fig. 12C). Other examples of channelized calcarenites, with a similar character and arrangement, were reported by Pujalte et al. (2022) in the Ricos creek and in the Claret road. The unchannelized calcarenites consist of 5\u201315\u202fcm thick individual tabular beds, most of them with flat erosional bases, intercalated within the silty marls. They are usually poorly exposed, being partly covered by silty marls, which makes it difficult to assess their number and extension. However, several examples can be traced laterally for tens of meters (Fig. 12D).\nThe large Claret Conglomerate outcrop around the Claret hamlet is almost everywhere overlain by friable silty marls of the Yellowish Soils, the erosion of which has exhumed wide portions of the sharp and nearly flat upper surface of the Claret Conglomerate (Fig. 11C; Supplementary Fig. 4C, D). In the St Adria valley, however, the Yellowish Soils indistinctly rest on the Claret Conglomerate or directly on the Esplugafreda Formation (Fig. 12A, D).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nSetting and climate during pre-PETM times: the Thanetian Esplugafreda Formation\nAs mentioned above, deposits from the proximal part of the northern margin of the Tremp-Graus Basin were largely removed by erosion after the Ypresian\u2212Oligocene tectonic deformation (Fig. 1B). However, a minor part was preserved in a small outlier near the Coll de Nargo village, about 35\u202fkm to the east of Tremp (Supplementary Fig. 1A). In this outlier the former mountain front is girded by Paleocene alluvial fans of comparatively modest dimensions, mostly composed of conglomerates, which grade into red marls with intercalated channels of the Esplugafreda Formation within a few hundreds of metres (Supplementary Fig. 7A). Based on this observation, Schmitz and Pujalte (2007) assumed that the entire northern margin of the Tremp-Graus Basin was flanked by similar alluvial fans in pre-PETM times (Supplementary Fig. 7B).\nThe widespread palaeosol carbonate nodules within the red marls of the Esplugafreda Formation provide some climatic information. Carbonate nodules, in effect, form under water deficit conditions. These conditions are generally met in climatic regimes characterized by either perennial arid conditions or a very marked dry season, with a narrow range of annual precipitation from about 100 to 900\u202fmm (Retallack, 2001; He et al., 2015). The co-occurrence of palaeosol carbonate nodules with remains of Microcodium (a proxy for Mediterranean climate; Calvet et al., 1991; Kabanov et al., 2008; Pujalte et al., 2019) and, especially, with profuse gypsum deposits, proves that the accumulation of the Esplugafreda Formation took place under a prevailing arid\/semiarid climate. In addition, Puigdefabregas et al. (1989) reported rootlet surfaces and mud cracks within the channels intercalated in the red marls, which were regarded as evidence of a highly ephemeral alluvial regime.\nThe present day coastal zone of the Granada province, in south-eastern Spain, has geographic and climatic characteristics similar to those of the Tremp-Graus Basin in pre-PETM times, as it is situated at about 37\u00b0N latitude, is flanked by mountains and has a semiarid climate. The former is, therefore, a suitable analogue to reconstruct the characteristics and processes on the latter. The Granada coastal zone is drained by a comparatively large river (Guadalfeo) and several smaller ravines, locally named \u201cramblas\u201d, all of which have developed fan deltas at their mouths (Supplementary Fig. 8A). The biggest fan delta, with a radius of ~6\u202fkm in its subaerial part, is fed by the Guadalfeo River, which has a drainage area of ~1300\u202fkm2. The ramblas have smaller drainage areas (\u2264170\u202fkm2), the subaerial parts of their attached fan deltas being correspondingly smaller, with radii between 1 and 2.5\u202fkm (Supplementary Fig. 8B, C). The distal expression of these fan deltas is represented by shallow subaquatic coastal clastic wedges ~1\u202fkm wide (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 1995). The development of these fan deltas was intermittent, mainly occurring during occasional rainstorm episodes. For instance, the subaerial part of the fan delta at the mouth of the Albu\u00f1ol rambla experienced rapid seaward progradation of up to 270\u202fm after a single, exceptional rainstorm (locally >600\u202fl\/m2) on October 18, 1973 (Capel Molina, 1974; Pujalte et al., 2022).\n\n\n5.2\nSetting of the Claret Conglomerate at the onset of the PETM\nAs indicated above, the Claret Conglomerate has been interpreted as having been deposited either by braided rivers (Dreyer, 1993; Colombera et al., 2017) or in the vast braidplain of an alluvial megafan (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007), the latter interpretation entailing that the PETM caused a more radical environmental change than the former. Facies analysis has limited value to weigh the merits of these two alternatives, as lithofacies of gravel-dominated braided rivers and alluvial fans are very similar. However, the architectural features of the Claret Conglomerate described above support the megafan interpretation. On the one hand, rather than the near homogeneous lateral thickness implicit in braided fluvial models (Fig. 2D), the Claret Conglomerate exhibits a large-scale mounded profile at Esplugafreda and nearby sectors, with a convex-up upper surface (Supplementary Fig. 1). Such a profile is typical of the transverse cross-section of alluvial fans, the thickest parts representing their axial zones. On the other hand, the discharge of braided rivers usually increases down current, but the discontinuous character of the Claret Conglomerate in the distal Claret sector implies diminished discharge, which is typical of alluvial fans. Last, but not least, the features of the five architectural ensembles recognized at Esplugafreda can be satisfactorily explained through comparison with recent small-scale fan-like accumulations.\nIndeed, the controls on the architecture of ancient and recent alluvial\/fluvial systems are increasingly being investigated with the help of small-scale models created in laboratory flumes (e.g., Strong and Paola, 2006; Reitz and Jerolmack, 2012; Van de Lageweg et al., 2013). In this study, however, we compared the architecture of the Claret Conglomerate with some natural, small-scale fan-like accumulations found during our field studies. The analogues that best match the lateral variability of the Claret Conglomerate in the Esplugafreda sector are those illustrated in Figs. 13\u221215\n\n\n, all of which developed on near flat, slightly sloping surfaces.\nThe multiepisodic fan in Fig. 13 was formed next to the trench of an active sand quarry in England. Its innermost zone, here labelled braidplain core (BPc; see Fig. 13 for acronyms), consists of a dense network of braided channels infilled with clean sands (whitish colour in Fig. 13A). Down current from the core different parts can be differentiated, the most prominent being lobe-shaped accumulations of brown-coloured sands (LBb) fed from braided channels (Bch). Similar coloured sands fringing the fan core represent previous lobes (LBa), partly encroached by the core expansion. These lobes have a convex-up upper surface, their flanks sloping to the right and left of the feeding braided channel (Fig. 13B). Intervening zones between lobes contain finer grained sediments and a network of smaller channels (SSd). Lastly, clays (DCl) were accumulated in the most distal part of the fan. The core, braided channels and lobes must have been active during and just after rainy episodes, as they contain the coarsest deposits of the system. After cessation of the rain, diminished runoff flowed preferentially through small channels within the depressed inter-lobe zones (FCh in Fig. 13A).\nThis model accounts for most of the features of the Claret Conglomerate in the Esplugafreda area. The braidplain core probably existed in the most proximal part of the Tremp-Graus Basin, but is not preserved today (Fig. 1B). However, Architectural Ensembles 1, 2, and 3 can, respectively, be ascribed to different parts situated down current from the core.\nThus, AE-1 can be assigned to either the external part of the braidplain core or to a major braided channel similar to the Scott type of Miall (1978). The predominance of coarse-grained conglomerates in this ensemble is, in effect, a proof of strong currents, the great mobility of the constituent minor channels and interchannel bars being respectively recorded by pervasive cross-cutting erosional surfaces and large-scale cross-strata (Fig. 5B\u2212D). Scour-and-fill relationships, which are common in braided channels, also exist in this ensemble.\nThe low-angle inclined strata of AE-2, with near opposite senses of accretion, are best explained by deposition on both flanks of a lobe, its central depression corresponding to the lobe-feeding channel. The variable thicknesses of the strata in the lobe flanks and the coarse-grained nature of their terminal protuberances can respectively be attributed to an intermittent growth of the lobe and to avalanching processes at the toes of the inclined strata. Lastly, the well-defined central channels of AE-3, which cut into \u22642\u202fm thick tabular-shaped conglomerates (Fig. 7A), suggest autogenic compensation processes and most likely represent small channels flowing through inter-lobe depressions (Ventra and Nichols, 2013, and references therein).\nThe two small-scale fans in Figs. 14 and 15 were originated in eastern Spain after single summer downpours and, consequently, have a simpler configuration. The example in Fig. 14 consists of two coalescent fans, a fact that precluded the full development of a fan-like geometry. However, the radial arrangement of distributary channels is perceptible on the left hand side of fan 1 (Fig. 14A, B). A depression infilled with somewhat finer sediments exists along the axis of this fan, with its lowest zone situated along its central part. This low zone is flanked by terraces, locally crossed by small channels, the terrace on the left being bordered by a small cliff (Fig. 14A, B). An axial depression also exists in fan 2, but not so well developed. The configuration of both small fans was a result of changing discharge after the storm: water spread over the entire fan at peak flow but, as the flow receded, it became restricted to a progressively narrower and deeper depression along the axial zone.\nThe features of this small-scale model are strikingly similar to those of AE-4 (cf., Figs. 8 and 14A, B), from which it is reasonable to conclude that this ensemble also records a strong variation in water discharge, although not necessarily after one single event. Thus, the parts of the ensemble situated east and west of points P1 and P2 record phase(s) of high discharge. The central depression must have been created during diminishing discharge, the undulating zone between points P2 and P3 satisfactorily comparing to the channelled part of the terrace in Fig. 14, and the segment between points P4 and P5 in Fig. 8C being ascribable to the phase of minimum streamflow.\nThe small-scale fan in Fig. 15 also records a strong variation in discharge. The fan must have grown, laterally and frontally, at peak discharge, when sedimentation occurred on the entire fan, as recorded by the dry part of the model (whitish, 1 in Fig. 15). With decreasing discharge, flowing water became restricted to discrete channels (light grey, 2 in Fig. 15, still wet) and, after further decrease, to a single channel that became fully entrenched into the fan (dark grey, 3 in Fig. 15).\nTwo key features of AE-5 can adequately be explained by this model. Thus, the lateral accretion arrangement and abrupt termination of conglomeratic strata (Fig. 9B) are readily attributable to the intermittent lateral growth of the fan during episodes of high discharge, whereas the central depression of the ensemble (Fig. 9A) clearly records current entrenchment at low discharge (Fig. 15).\nIn summary, the architectural features of the Claret Conglomerate in the Esplugafreda sector are best explained by deposition in a megafan, rather than in separate braided rivers. This implies that the small alluvial fans fringing the northern margin of Tremp-Graus Basin in Thanetian times rapidly expanded and coalesced into the braidplain of a megafan at the onset of the PETM, their deposits mantling most of the northern half of the basin. This interpretation also explains the discontinuous and generally modest dimensions of the Claret Conglomerate outcrops in the Claret sector, which probably represent distal segments of individual lobes. The lens-like shape of the large outcrop around the Claret hamlet suggests a composite package, probably the result of the concentration of lobes along a former, partly buried incised valley.\n\n\n5.3\nHydroclimatic change at the onset of the PETM\nClimate modelling results by Kiehl et al. (2018) indicated that seasonality enhanced in the Pyrenees during the PETM. Both surface air temperature and evaporation increased in summer (June\u2013August), whereas rainfall increased by 50\u2013200%, especially in autumn (October\u2013January), which also led to increased runoff.\nTo our knowledge, the only specific attempt to quantify the hydrological change induced by the PETM using proxy data from the Tremp-Graus Basin is that of Chen et al. (2018). However, leaving aside that some key data used in their calculation are flawed (see above and Supplementary Fig. 2), it is not clear whether their postulated 1.35 to 14 times increase in water discharge during the PETM refers to individual events or to an augmentation in annual rainfall.\nHere an alternative approach is used, based on historical and recent records of floods and meteorological data from mid-latitude Spain during the last century (Supplementary Fig. 9). The rationale for this approach is that, although global boundary conditions were different in PETM times, both the palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic characteristics of the Tremp-Graus Basin were similar to those of today's south-eastern Spain, as discussed above. Therefore, historical and recent meteorological records from Spain may provide some clues about the hydrological changes in the Tremp-Graus Basin at the onset of the PETM, assuming that the anthropogenic warming and the PETM are comparable events.\nThe Spanish records demonstrate that from 1916 to 2019 the number of floods caused by exceptional rainfall events has increased steadily (see Supplementary Fig. 9A for actual data and plot). This trend can also be observed in the floods of rivers debouching into the Mediterranean in SE Spain (\u201cSE coastal basins\u201d in Supplementary Fig. 9A). In the Guadalfeo River, for example, five large floods were recorded between the years 835 and 1985 (a return period of 230\u202fyears), and another five between 1917 and 1973 (a return period of 56\u202fyears) (Rodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00ednez and Mesa-Garrido, 2016. The effect of these recent floods on the fan deltas is minimized by the construction of dams and other corrective measures in the river courses. However, as mentioned above, the fan delta attached to the Albu\u00f1ol rambla, in which no dam exists, prograded up to 270\u202fm after a single rainstorm in 1973. Interestingly, historical meteorological data show that out of 27 exceptional rainfall events in the Mediterranean Spanish SE coastal basins between 1916 and 2019, 20 occurred in October and November and another four in September; only one occurred in January and two in February. This compares well with the palaeoclimatic conditions modelled for the PETM Tremp-Graus Basin, which deduced increased rainfall and runoff in autumn (Kiehl et al., 2018).\nYet, data from four meteorological stations from coastal Mediterranean Spanish cities demonstrate that, in the last eighty years, the cumulative amount of rain during successive quinquennia, although variable, has not changed significantly (Supplementary Fig. 9C). Consequently, assuming that the recent hydrological changes in Spain are comparable to those during the PETM onset, it is reasonable to conclude that the single most important cause of the expansion of the Claret Conglomerate was a strong enhancement of seasonality, with a concomitant increase in the frequency and intensity of rainstorms in autumn, but without a significant variation in the volume of averaged total annual precipitation.\n\n\n5.4\nSetting and hydroclimate during the core of the PETM: The Yellowish Soils\nThe lateral accretion and fining upward arrangement of the calcarenites intercalated in the Yellowish Soils at Esplugafreda are clear proof of accumulation on point bars of meandering rivers. The regular alternation of very fine- and medium-grained calcarenites in these point bars suggests a rather stable fluvial regime (Fig. 10). Medium-grained calcarenites, however, are dominant in the westernmost part of the point bar encased within the central depression of AE-5 (Fig. 10A). Likely, the lateral growth of the point bar progressively infilled the depression, narrowing the channel cross-section and increasing flow velocity, which hindered the deposition of fine-grained load. The multistorey character of the channelized calcarenites included in the Yellowish Soils of the Claret sector, together with the lateral accretion of their stacked packages, are indicative of fluvial meander belts. The unchannelized calcarenites, on the other hand, most likely record crevasse splay deposits. The high proportion of fine-grained sediments in the Yellowish Soils, both at Esplugafreda and Claret, requires extensive floodplains. This fact provides additional evidence for a meandering fluvial system, since abundance of suspended load and cohesive banks favours meandering courses.\nThe abundant small-sized carbonate nodules of the Yellowish Soils suggest perennial or seasonal (semi)arid conditions, since that kind of nodule is only formed under water deficit conditions (Retallack, 2001). The conspicuous absence of Microcodium and gypsum in the Yellowish Soils attests to a generally more humid (or less arid) climate than in pre-PETM times. Furthermore, clastic sedimentation rates during the accumulation of the Yellowish Soils increased 5\u201310 fold, an increase also observed in coeval marine sections of the Pyrenees. This increase indicates a high yield of detritus in the river discharge and deep physical erosion of the landscape, which suggests long and dry summers leading to the absence of a dense, protective vegetation cover (Schmitz et al., 2001; Schmitz and Pujalte, 2003). Interestingly, the carbonate nodules of the Yellowish Soils are homogeneously dispersed throughout the silty marls in the two studied zones (Fig. 2A, B), a distribution typical of cumulate soil profiles (in the sense of Wright and Marriott, 1996, and Kraus, 1999). These soils develop by (near) steady aggradation through frequent increments of sediments, so that the upper part of their profile is buried and reorganized by processes occurring at deeper levels (Wright and Marriot, 1996, p. 908). Carbonate nodules typically form in the lower horizon of the soil profile, the so-called calcic horizon or Bk (Retallack, 2001). Therefore, their occurrence throughout the whole thickness of the Yellowish Soils is clear proof of the destruction, through reworking, of the upper palaeosol horizons. Additional increments of sediments eventually placed the Bk horizons below the zone of active pedogenesis, which accounts for their preservation and explains the small size of the nodules. These processes necessarily entail frequent inundation of the floodplains represented by the silty marls of the Yellowish Soils, but the absence of coarse-grained deposits demonstrates a drastic diminution of the high magnitude floods inferred for the Claret Conglomerate. Taken together, these facts indicate recurrent but rather tranquil stream flows and, consequently, a more evenly distributed rain during the wet season. Finally, the progressively higher chroma of the silty marl palaeosols towards the upper part of the unit (Supplementary Fig. 5) suggests a trend to increasingly drier conditions (cf., Armengolt et al., 2019).\nThe generally sharp boundary between the Claret Conglomerate and the Yellowish Soils (Supplementary Fig. 4) might be interpreted as an abrupt transition between their respective hydroclimate states. However, the transition from the onset to the core phases of the PETM in \u03b413C isotopic profiles is gradual (e.g., Fig. 2A; see also Zachos et al., 2008), which should have resulted in a similarly progressive sedimentary change. Evidence for such a gradual change is provided by the central depressions in architectural ensembles 4 and 5 of the Claret Conglomerate, which, as discussed above, are attributable to a progressive reduction in flow magnitude (Figs. 14, 15). In effect, avulsion processes are particularly common in low gradient alluvial fans (Gole and Chitale, 1996) and so, at different times, sediments would accumulate on most parts of the Claret Conglomerate. However, the decrease of high magnitude flows would reduce avulsion frequency, the diminished flows becoming restricted, and eventually entrenched, along specific tracts of the former megafan, creating depressed zones in its upper part. The occupation of both central depressions by meandering rivers most likely culminated the transition between the sedimentary and hydroclimatic regimes represented by the Claret Conglomerate and the Yellowish Soils.\n\n\n5.5\nSetting and hydroclimate during the recovery of the PETM: the Gypsum-rich Unit\nAs previously noted by several authors (e. g., Schmitz and Pujalte, 2003; Domingo et al., 2009; Pujalte et al., 2022), the climate became quite arid in the Tremp-Graus Basin during the recovery phase of the PETM, an aridification process heralded by the high chroma palaeosols of the upper part of the Yellowish Soils. In effect, in addition to its tell-tale gypsum abundance, a distinctive feature of the Gypsum-rich Unit is the complete absence of carbonate nodules, which suggests that during the recovery phase of the PETM annual precipitation was less than 100\u202fmm (cf., Retallack, 2001). Furthermore, the absence of conglomerates and calcarenites within the unit demonstrates that the currents resulting from occasional rains were only capable of transporting silts and clays (Fig. 3C), and must therefore have been of reduced volume and strength. Lastly, the accumulation of alabastrine gypsum in the Claret area is proof that the eventual flows reaching the Claret area evaporated in saline lakes (Fig. 3D).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe notion that the PETM induced an important change in hydroclimate is far from new. The data here presented confirm that change, but also show that in the mid-latitude terrestrial Tremp-Graus Basin the hydroclimate varied in parallel with the three phases of the hyperthermal event, profoundly altering depositional conditions as the CO2 content in the atmosphere varied.\nIn this basin, in effect, an arid\/semiarid climate persisted during Thanetian times, when the mountainous northern margin of the basin was fringed by alluvial fans of comparatively small dimensions. The rapid addition of CO2 during the onset of the PETM prompted an enhancement of seasonality, inducing frequent rainstorms and high magnitude floods in autumn. This hydroclimate forced a rapid expansion of the previous marginal alluvial fans, which coalesced to create an extensive conglomeratic braidplain in the proximal part of a megafan that mantled the northern half of the basin, represented by the Claret Conglomerate.\nDuring the core of the PETM the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere was higher, but remained more or less stable. Seasonality became less contrasted, still with long, dry summers but without, or with few, high magnitude floods and with the rain more equally distributed throughout the wet season. As a result, meandering rivers with extensive floodplains encroached onto the entire basin. Inundations of the flood plains were frequent in the wet season, the concomitant sedimentary flux causing their aggradation. The absence of a dense vegetation cover led to deep physical erosion of the landscape and high fluvial sediment yield, which induced a significant increase in sedimentation rate relative to pre-PETM times, an increase also recorded in marine settings of the Pyrenees. Total annual rain, however, diminished towards the end of this phase, initiating a trend that culminated in an arid hydroclimate during the recovery of the PETM, when saline lakes developed in the central part of the basin.\nDuring the PETM the Tremp-Graus Basin was situated at ~35\u00b0N palaeolatitude, between the dry subtropical zone to the south and the subhumid temperate climate zone to the north, a transitional area especially sensitive to global climate changes. This specific latitudinal location most probably enhanced the hydroclimate variations during the successive phases of the hyperthermal event.\nThe PETM is widely acknowledged as an ancient analogue of the ongoing anthropogenic warming, which seems to be in its onset phase. Continental outcrops like the unique Pyrenees sections studied herein provide the most informative records of the succession of climate change phases during the PETM. If the current rates of CO2 emissions continue unabated, a sequence of hydroclimatic and environmental changes similar to those registered in the Tremp-Graus Basin can be expected in mid-latitude terrestrial basins and coastal plains adjacent to, and fed from, nearby mountainous areas.\n\n","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe facies record of water discharge variability in fluvial successions has long been a debated research topic. For example, many early studies of present-day and recent ephemeral stream floods in arid areas described a great variety of sedimentary structures indicating both upper- and lower-flow regime sedimentation in the resulting deposits (e.g., Williams, 1971; Karcz, 1972; Picard and High, 1973), whereas other authors conversely reported a significant predominance of horizontal stratification in deposits of similar origin (e.g., McKee et al., 1967; Frostick and Reid, 1977). Similarly, in the rock record, some successions interpreted as the product of ephemeral streams are dominated by horizontal lamination (Tunbridge, 1981), whereas many others display a wider variety of structures and architectural arrangements indicative of variable flow regimes (Wells, 1983; Stear, 1985; Olsen, 1989; Bromley, 1991; North and Taylor, 1996; Soares et al., 2021). Such variability, in terms of sedimentary structures and architectures, suggests that any interpretation of ephemeral or perennial flow based on particular lithofacies arrangements are inherently uncertain (cf. Colombera and Mountney, 2019), and that consideration should be given to specific evidence of streambed drying (e.g., mudcracks, root marks, burrows) (Bridge and Demicco, 2008).\nNonetheless, the role of discharge variability as a fundamental control on the resultant facies architecture of river systems is increasingly emphasized (Fielding et al., 2009, 2018; Plink-Bj\u00f6rklund, 2015; Leary and Ganti, 2020). In this perspective, new categories of fluvial systems between the perennial and ephemeral end-members are considered, including for example strongly seasonal rivers with intermittent fluvial channels, as described by Allen et al. (2014). The recognition of relevant sedimentary features that can be referred to for characterizing different types of successions in terms of discharge variability allows the re-evaluation of ancient fluvial successions and their palaeohydraulic and palaeoclimatic interpretations. This is particularly relevant to fluvial systems that may not necessarily be located in ancient arid or monsoonal regions, where discharge variability is expected, but rather in subtropical or temperate zones where strongly seasonal conditions may be favoured by local climatic, palaeogeographic and\/or orographic characteristics. Thus, the water discharge variability of alluvial systems is related to extrinsic (allogenic) controls on sedimentation, particularly climate and tectonics, which can ultimately control the evolution and facies architecture of a fluvial system. In cases where the timing and magnitude with which these allogenic drivers operate can be inferred thanks to available geological constraints, it becomes possible to evaluate the architectural record of such extrinsic controls.\nIn the eastern part of the Tremp-Graus basin (southern Pyrenees, Spain), and specifically in the Ar\u00e9n and Esplugafreda sectors, there exist laterally continuous exposures of a fluvial succession described as dominantly being the product of ephemeral rivers (Dreyer, 1993). This succession, informally named as Upper Red Garumnian (Rosell et al., 2001), spans the transition between the Paleocene and Eocene, and has been the focus of numerous studies that aimed to define a general sedimentological and stratigraphic framework (e.g., M\u00e9dus and Colombo, 1991; Cuevas, 1992; Dreyer, 1993; Pujalte and Schmitz, 2005; L\u00f3pez-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2006b). From a more regional perspective, the study of the structural evolution of the Pyrenees, together with the application of geochronological techniques, has allowed the definition of different stages of tectonic uplift and the influence of such uplift on the sedimentation of the entire Late Cretaceous to Miocene synorogenic succession (e.g. C\u00e1mara and Klimowitz, 1985; Puigdef\u00e0bregas et al., 1992; Ard\u00e8vol et al., 2000; Whitchurch et al., 2011). Additionally, with the identification of a negative carbon isotopic excursion associated with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; Schmitz and Pujalte, 2003), this succession has been the focus of studies on the stratigraphic identification of this hyperthermal event, and on the associated environmental responses preserved in the sedimentary record (Manners et al., 2013; Dawson et al., 2014; Adatte et al., 2014; Pujalte et al., 2014; Colombera et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Duller et al., 2019). Previous local studies from the Ar\u00e9n and Esplugafreda exposures have documented evidences of pedogenic and diagenetic processes (Fjellbirkeland, 1990), palaeofloras (M\u00e9dus and Colombo, 1991), and the records of depositional environments and external controlling factors on sedimentation (Dreyer, 1993).\nThe aim of this study is to leverage on the excellent exposures at these localities to present detailed qualitative and quantitative descriptions of this fluvial succession, and to document sedimentary features at different scales (macroscopic to megascopic), to enable inferences of the effects of variations in river discharge at different temporal scales (from that of a single flash flood to the order of 105\u202fyr). In addition, by building on current knowledge of the tectonic evolution of the Pyrenees, and of climatic conditions at the Paleocene-Eocene transition, this study assesses the evolutionary response of this fluvial system under constrained sets of allogenic conditions. Specific research objectives are as follows: (i) to document the geometry and internal lithofacies arrangement of the architectural elements of this succession, and vertical trends thereof, using techniques in lithofacies- and architectural-element analyses; (ii) to quantify the geometry of coarse-grained (arenaceous and conglomeratic) bodies by integrating data from orthophotographs, LiDAR DEMs, field photomosaics and ground-based GPS measurements; (iii) and to interpret formative sedimentary processes, depositional sub-environments, and variations in environmental conditions through the stratigraphy.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Pyrenean mountain chain is an asymmetric fold-and-thrust belt oriented in WNW-ESE direction, which extends for ~400\u202fkm between France and the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 1A) (Choukroune, 1992; Bond and McClay, 1995; Ard\u00e8vol et al., 2000; Sibuet et al., 2004). This orogenic chain comprises an axial zone of Hercynian rocks, two oppositely verging tectonic wedges (the North Pyrenean Zone and the South Pyrenean Units), and two peripheral foreland basins, the Aquitanian and Ebro basins to the north and south, respectively (Choukroune, 1992; Capote et al., 2002; Naylor and Sinclair, 2008). The South Pyrenean Units constitute a south-verging tectonic wedge, which is transversally divided by the Pamplona and Segre oblique wrench faults into Basque (western), Tremp-Jaca-Pamplona (central) and Cadi (eastern) units (Luterbacher et al., 1991; Costa et al., 1996; Rosell et al., 2001). The Tremp-Jaca-Pamplona unit, itself, contains an easternmost part named as Central South Pyrenean Unit (CSPU) whose western boundary corresponds to the N-S to NW-SE trending Sobrarbe oblique fold-and-thrust system (Fig. 1B) (C\u00e1mara and Klimowitz, 1985; Capote et al., 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012). The CSPU is a type of piggyback thrust system (Butler, 1982), which itself comprises three main WNW-ESE oriented thrust systems detached over Triassic evaporitic and argillaceous rock units. From north to south and top to bottom (Fig. 1B), these are the B\u00f3ixols (Bo), Montsec (Mo) and Serres Marginals (SM) thrust systems (Teixell and Mu\u00f1oz, 2000; Capote et al., 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012). On the Montsec thrust sheet, a broad syncline forms a piggyback basin known as Tremp-Graus basin (TGB), which contains a mixed clastic and calcareous sedimentary fill of Paleocene to Eocene age (Ori and Friend, 1984; Nijman, 1998; Capote et al., 2002).\nThe study area is located in the northern-central sector of the Tremp-Graus Basin, between the localities of Ar\u00e9n and Esplugafreda (Fig. 1C). The stratigraphic interval of interest is part of a mainly fine-grained and red-coloured succession that extends across a wide part of the eastern Pyrenean domain, and which has been named as \u2018Garumnian\u2019 (Leymerie, 1868; Rosell et al., 2001), Tremp Formation (Mey et al., 1968) or Tremp Group (Cuevas, 1992). Although the rank of group better reflects the complexity of this unit (Pujalte and Schmitz, 2005), the lack of consistency in distinguishing the different formations within the Tremp Group has precluded the widespread adoption of this term (Riera et al., 2009). Herein, the informal lithostratigraphic nomenclature of Rosell et al. (2001) is adopted, which translates to the Tremp Group subunits of Cuevas (1992) as follows: the \u2018Grey Garumnian\u2019 is equivalent to the Posa Formation; the \u2018Lower Red Garumnian\u2019 to the Conques and Talarn formations, and the \u2018Upper Red Garumnian\u2019 to the Esplugafreda and Claret formations (Riera et al., 2009).\nThe interval discussed here is the \u2018Upper Red Garumnian\u2019, which is a fluvial succession dominantly composed of calciclastic, mainly red-coloured mudrocks, locally banded due to pedogenic processes, and which contain calciclastic sandstone and conglomeratic bodies. Massive to crudely nodular pedogenic carbonates (calcrete) are present, though only locally. The upper part of the succession, which corresponds to the Claret Formation of Baceta et al. (2011) and Pujalte et al. (2014), locally contains a lower part (informal \u2018member 1\u2019 of the abovementioned authors) corresponding to local incised valley fills, which are overlain by an interval dominantly composed of amalgamated conglomeratic bodies (\u2018member 2\u2019). This latter interval, also named as the Claret Conglomerate by Pujalte and Schmitz (2005), has been interpreted as a megafan deposit, and covers an area of over 500\u202fkm2 (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007). The lower contact of the Upper Red Garumnian is not exposed in the study area, but across the Tremp-Graus basin this unit overlies an important stratigraphic surface marked locally by a palaeosol catena known as the Colmenar-Tremp Horizon (Luterbacher et al., 1991; L\u00f3pez-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2006a). The top of the Upper Red Garumnian corresponds to a transitional contact with a succession of calcareous and terrigenous marine sediments, which across the study area comprises a basal interval of fossiliferous limestones referred to in the literature as \u2018Alveolina Limestone\u2019 (Serra-Kiel et al., 1994, and references therein).\nWell-drained and oxidizing substrate conditions prevailed during most of the Upper Red Garumnian deposition, resulting in a dominant (though not exclusively) red colour for the preserved succession. Due to these conditions, the palaeontological record of the Upper Red Garumnian is very limited; across the Tremp-Graus Basin, macro and microfossils are only found locally. Fossils and related features comprise palynomorphs (M\u00e9dus, 1977; M\u00e9dus and Colombo, 1991; Tremp and Esplugafreda sections, respectively), charophytes (Feist and Colombo, 1983; Claret section), mammals (L\u00f3pez-Martinez and Pel\u00e1ez-Campomanes, 1999; Tremp area) and eggshells (Donaire and L\u00f3pez-Mart\u00ednez, 2009; Claret section). Palynomorphs from the Esplugafreda section allow attribution of this succession to the shallow benthic biozones Alveolina levis (SBZ4) to A. ellipsoidalis (SBZ6) (M\u00e9dus and Colombo, 1991). Palynomorphs and charophytes from the Claret section are assigned to the intervals A. primaeva (SBZ3) to A. cucumiformis (SBZ5) (M\u00e9dus, 1977; Feist and Colombo, 1983). Based on the biozonation scheme of Serra-Kiel et al. (1998) and the timescale of Gradstein et al. (2008), these biozones comprise the Thanetian (Paleocene) to earliest Ypresian (Eocene) (Fig. 2\n).\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThis study combines results from two main activities: (i) photointerpretation of remotely sensed imagery; and (ii) acquisition of sedimentological data in the field. Photointerpretation was undertaken on different sets of publicly available remote-sensing imagery (National Geographic Institute of Spain; Geographic and Geologic Institute of Catalonia). These datasets included high-resolution orthophotographs (horizontal resolution: 2.5\u202fm) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) topographic data (horizontal resolution: 0.5 point\/m2). The chosen LiDAR dataset, which included a predetermined classification, was filtered to use only ground and model key points to generate a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). A DEM with pixel size of 2\u202fm was generated. Through application of a gradient filter, the channelized elements, which show steeper slopes than the surrounding mudrocks, were highlighted to facilitate their mapping. Based on a combination of the processed DEM with high-resolution orthophotographs and field photomosaics, 220 channelized elements were identified and digitized.\nThe field work was undertaken to acquire quantitative and qualitative sedimentological data on channelized elements and floodplain deposits. Following the methodology of Kjemperud et al. (2008), channelized elements of thickness greater than 0.5\u202fm were identified and mapped. To characterize these channel bodies, representative stratigraphic sections were logged, and the orientations of bounding surfaces and palaeocurrent indicators were measured (330 measurements, 318 of which correspond to different types of cross-bedding). A record of the orientation of the channel bodies was hampered by the overall limited three-dimensionality of the outcrops, but the likely orientation of the channel bodies could nevertheless be inferred in the field thanks to the presence of additional palaeocurrent indicators (imbricated clasts, sole marks) and the orientation of cut-banks that are locally exposed in three dimensions. A total of 257 logs were measured (516\u202fm cumulative thickness); they record information from 180 channel bodies. Additionally, for an overall characterization of the entire succession, 15 continuous stratigraphic logs (882\u202fm cumulative thickness) were measured using a Jacob staff with a laser sighting stage designed for precise thickness measurement (Patacci, 2016). In addition to the detailed sedimentological and stratigraphic work in the Ar\u00e9n-Esplugafreda sector, observations of the Upper Red Garumnian near the localities of Claret and Gurp (Fig. 1C) were also gathered. For sedimentological logging, the lithofacies scheme of Colombera et al. (2013), itself a modified version of the fluvial lithofacies scheme by Miall (1996), was used. For the description and interpretation of bounding surfaces, the scheme of Tedesco et al. (2010), which is based on the classic scheme of Miall (1996), was used. To describe the geometry and shape of channelized elements based on their width-to-thickness ratio, the nomenclature of Gibling (2006) was adopted. In the case of conglomeratic bodies coarser than granulestone, the modal clast size was determined by the count of 20 gravel fragments; the size of the single largest clast, following the methodology of Lindholm (1987), was also determined. For the grain-size description of gravel fractions, the Udden-Wenthworth modified scale of Blair and McPherson (1999) was used.\n\n\n4\nLocal geology of the Upper Red Garumnian\nBased on the integration of the photogeological interpretation with the field study, the Upper Red Garumnian in the study area has been subdivided in four intervals (1 to 4 from base to top). Mapping results of these four intervals and of the different types of conglomerate and sandstone bodies (channelized elements and sediment gravity-flow deposits) are shown in Figs. 3 and 4\n\n for the Ar\u00e9n and Esplugafreda areas, respectively. Rose diagrams with the restored palaeocurrent (cross-stratification and cross-lamination) data are shown for each area. Palaeocurrent vector means consistently indicate a SSE to SSW sediment-transport direction, in agreement with the notion of the outcrop belt being oriented approximately along strike; however, important dispersion in palaeocurrent orientations is seen, which is compatible with the interpretation of a relatively low-gradient fluvial plain. The basal boundary of interval 1 is not exposed. The basal boundary of the intervals 2\u20133 has been defined in local stratigraphic sections and laterally extrapolated thanks to the consistent stratigraphic occurrence of basal coarse-grained conglomeratic deposits or correlative unconfined heterolithic deposits. However, there are extensive sectors where these coarser-grained deposits are absent, and the corresponding boundary cannot be traced confidently. The basal boundary of the Interval 4 corresponds locally to the Claret Conglomerate, which can be readily identified in outcrop, or to the base of underlying localised valley fills. Representative lithofacies are shown in Fig. 5\n. Vertical profiles recording successions of these lithofacies for the Ar\u00e9n (Fig. 6\n) and Esplugafreda sections (Fig. 7\n) highlight the predominance of fine-grained lithofacies in the Upper Red Garumnian.\n\n\n5\nLithofacies\nFourteen lithofacies were identified, principally on the basis of their texture and sedimentary structures (Table 1\n; Fig. 5). These lithofacies comprise conglomerates (four types), sandstones (six types), fine-grained lithofacies (three types) and pedogenic carbonates. The fine-grained lithofacies comprise (i) massive packages of mudstones and siltstones (Fsm lithofacies) and (ii) interbeds of very fine-grained sandstones and siltstones (Fl lithofacies). For each of these fine-grained lithofacies, two subtypes have been defined, based on colour variations from red to grey hues, and respectively designated by addition of r (red) and g (grey) letters after the main lithofacies code. The third fine-grained lithofacies (Fmc), which shows a very restricted stratigraphic occurrence, consists of grey-coloured mudstones with coaly fragments. Concentrations of pedogenic calcareous nodules (P lithofacies) form a distinct, non-clastic lithotype. The detrital components of the conglomeratic and arenaceous lithofacies described here are usually calciclastic sensu Braunstein (1961).\n\n\n6\nDepositional and architectural elements\nThe Upper Red Garumnian succession in the studied area comprises three main depositional elements associated with specific sedimentary processes and settings: (i) channelized fluvial deposits, (ii) sediment gravity-flow deposits and (iii) fluvial non-channelized deposits. In these types of depositional elements, six classes of architectural elements have been defined. Channelized deposits comprise three architectural-element types, which are distinguished according to their geometry and degree of complexity defined by their internal architecture. Sediment gravity-flow deposits are represented by a unique element type. Non-channelized deposits are represented by two types of elements defined according to their geometry, dominant lithotypes and interpreted relative distance away from genetically related fluvial channel deposits. Representative sketches and logs of these six types of architectural elements, together with pie charts depicting overall proportions of lithofacies in each type based on cumulative facies thickness, are shown in Fig. 8\n. Statistics referring to the thickness, apparent width and width-to-thickness (W\/T) ratios of the coarse-grained bodies (channelized elements and sediment gravity flow deposits) are shown in Table 2\n.\n\n6.1\nChannelized fluvial deposits\nThe subdivision here established for channelized deposits comprises three different types: (i) simple single-storey channelized elements (FC1); (ii) compound single-storey channelized elements (FC2); and (iii) multi-storey and multilateral channelized elements (FC3). The distinction between these different elements is based on their preserved geometry, internal architecture, and recognition and interpretation of the bounding surfaces delimiting these bodies and their constituent packages of strata. Simpler channelized bodies (FC1 and FC2) record mostly vertical aggradation processes, whereas more complex bodies (FC3) show more diverse architectural styles, including evidence of lateral and downstream barform accretion. However, it is important to note that because the orientation of the Ar\u00e9n and Esplugafreda outcropping sections is mostly normal to slightly oblique with respect to the dominant palaeoflow direction, downstream accretion geometries may be underrecognized in the available exposures.\n\n6.1.1\nSimple single-storey channelized elements (FC1)\n\n6.1.1.1\nDescription\nThirty-nine instances of these channelized elements were described and recognized in all the stratigraphic intervals defined for the Upper Red Garumnian in the study area; they tend to be more common in the intervals 1 and 2. The thickness of these elements ranges from 0.5\u202fm to 1.3\u202fm; their average apparent width is 11.8\u202fm. According to their apparent width-to-thickness ratios, they mostly comprise of broad ribbons to narrow sheet-like bodies (Table 2). The base of these elements is sharp and corresponds to 4th-order bounding surfaces (Miall, 1985), whose relief is mostly flat or slightly concave-upward (Fig. 9A), and only locally irregular and strongly incisional. These elements are outlined by a single channel form, here termed as \u2018storey\u2019.\nIn most cases (26 examples), these elements are dominated internally by either conglomeratic or sandy facies, with no marked grainsize trend (Fig. 9B); in 12 cases, a fining-upward trend is observed, usually associated with the vertical superposition of sandstone lithofacies above a basal conglomerate; only one example of coarsening-upward pattern was documented. Horizontally bedded conglomerates (Gh: 39.66%) and sandstones (Sh: 26.1%) are the dominant lithofacies. Conglomerates and sandstones with planar cross-bedding are observed in lower proportions (Gp: 11.2% and Sp: 10.7% respectively), and can either occur indistinctly as the only lithofacies present, or be preferentially located at the base (Fig. 9C) or toward the top (Fig. 9D) of these channelized elements; massive conglomerates (Gcm) attain an abundance of 6.4%; other lithofacies types occur in percentages lower than 5%; only one example of rippled-sandstones capping the channel fill was recorded; fine-grained (F lithofacies) are not observed in these channel bodies.\n\n\n6.1.1.2\nInterpretation\nThese bodies are interpreted to record the infill of a channel form associated with the development of bedload sheets or dunes. Bedding surfaces can be associated with minor changes in flow conditions. Channel bodies dominated by plane-bedded conglomeratic and arenaceous lithofacies can result from bedload deposition associated with shallow and high-energy floods, formed under upper flow-regime conditions (Williams, 1971; Wells, 1983; Abdullatif, 1989; Hassan et al., 2009; Reid and Frostick, 2011). Cross-bedded facies can be associated with flows having a deeper water column and lower flow-regime conditions (Fielding, 2006). The limited occurrence of sandstone with ripple lamination in similar ancient deposits has been associated with rapidly waning flows (Tunbridge, 1984). The single-storey nature of these channel bodies and the general absence of fine-grained partings suggest, in most cases, deposition from a single flood event (Tunbridge, 1981). The occurrence of massive conglomerates as basal channel-fill deposits can be associated with gravel accumulations related to gravel bars, as seen in recent ephemeral streams (Hassan, 2005), which are deposited during high flow stages (Hassan et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n6.1.2\nCompound single-storey channelized elements (FC2)\n\n6.1.2.1\nDescription\nAmong the coarse-grained bodies described in the Upper Red Garumnian, these elements are the most abundant with 108 examples recorded; they occur indistinctly in the four intervals defined. Their maximum thickness ranges from 0.8\u202fm to 5.6\u202fm, but most of the bodies show values between 1.0\u202fm and 2.9\u202fm; their average apparent width is 26.1\u202fm. The apparent width-to-thickness ratio indicates approximately equal occurrence of broad or narrow ribbon bodies and narrow sheet-like bodies (Table 2). The basal surfaces of these elements, corresponding to 5th-order bounding surfaces, can be planar (Fig. 10A), else concave-upward and very irregular (Fig. 10B and C). Where observed, the margins are incisional and can be very steep (Fig. 10A).\nInternally, FC2 elements are single-storey but composed of vertically stacked strata sets separated by 3rd-order surfaces. These surfaces show a planar to moderately concave-upward relief. Due to the occurrence of multiple internal sets, the overall grain-size pattern of these channel bodies is highly variable; some elements can display a fining-upward trend (Fig. 10A), whereas others are capped by conglomeratic lithofacies (Fig. 10B and D). In most cases, each bedset shows internally a decrease in grain size, with lower beds of conglomerates and sandstones overlain by fine-grained lithofacies (see the different examples in Fig. 10). As in the previous case, horizontally bedded conglomerates and sandstones are the most abundant lithofacies, with respective values of 37.8% and 33.6%; massive conglomerates (Gcm: 7.5%) and fine-grained heterolithic lithofacies (Fl: 8.7%) are also notable; other lithofacies, including cross-bedded conglomerates and sandstones, occur in percentages lower than 3%. Some of the sandstone lithofacies rarely show intense bioturbation, although this is more common in the fine-grained lithofacies, which additionally show the development of mud-cracks.\n\n\n6.1.2.2\nInterpretation\nThese bodies are interpreted to record a channel-filling process associated with the vertical stacking of the deposits of bedload sheets, upper flow regime plane-beds and, subordinately, 2D and 3D dunes. They record different flow conditions occurring in the same fluvial channel; the product of individual flows are usually separated by mud-drapes, which formed during waning stages; the very limited degree of scouring indicates that limited erosion took place between and during different flow events (cf. Picard and High, 1973; Hampton and Horton, 2007).\n\n\n\n6.1.3\nMulti-storey and multilateral channelized elements (FC3)\n\n6.1.3.1\nDescription\nTwenty-five examples of the studied channel bodies correspond to multi-storey and\/or multilateral channelized elements (FC3); these are present in all the four stratigraphic intervals defined for the Upper Red Garumnian in the studied area. The maximum thickness of these channel bodies is variable and ranges from 2.1 to 9.4\u202fm; their average apparent width is 246.9\u202fm. Their overall geometry, defined by their apparent width-to-thickness ratio, indicates the predominance of narrow and broad sheet-like bodies over ribbon-shaped bodies (Table 2). The basal surface of these elements can correspond to planar 5th-order, or, in some cases (e.g. the Claret Conglomerate), 6th-order surfaces delimiting major and laterally continuous stratigraphic packages (Fig. 11A). An upward increase in the apparent width of these elements is observed, specifically in the uppermost part of the interval 3 (maps of Figs. 3 and 4), and reaching a more significant expression in the Claret Conglomerate, where bodies attain apparent widths of more than 700\u202fm.\nThe internal geometry of these elements indicates the vertical, lateral and downstream superposition (stacking) of macroforms separated by 4th-order surfaces, which are either erosional (4e, Figs. 11A, B and C) or accretionary (4a, Fig. 11A and D) in nature; erosional reactivation surfaces can show prominent (metric) relief, with evident excavation of the older coarse-grained deposits (Fig. 11B and C); accretionary surfaces can display moderate relief in oblique to strike views (Fig. 11A), but in other cases can correspond to the steep lee face of conglomeratic bars onlapped by channel fill deposits (Fig. 11D). Individual macroforms are between 1\u202fm and 4\u202fm thick, and comprise mostly coarse-grained associations of conglomerates and sandstones; rarely finer-grained fills of mudrocks and fine-grained sandstones are also present (Fig. 11D). As in the previous examples of channelized elements, horizontally bedded conglomerates (Gh: 41.5%) and sandstones (Sh: 17.6%) are the dominant lithofacies; in addition, massive conglomerates can be abundant (Gcm: 12.9%) and may occur in association with planar cross-bedded conglomerates (8.0%); heterolithic siltstones and fine-grained sandstones also represent an important component (8.2%); other lithofacies types are subordinate and occur with percentages of less than 3.0%. Subordinate finer-grained lithofacies (Fsm and Fmc, less than 1%) exhibit pedoturbation, in the form of reddish mudstone with calcareous nodules, rhizoliths and mudcracks, or occur as localized lenses of grey mudstone with coaly fragments (restricted to interval 4). The occurrence of oncoidal coatings around some gravel-sized clasts in conglomeratic beds is restricted to some channelized elements of the interval 4, specifically of the Claret Conglomerate.\n\n\n6.1.3.2\nInterpretation\nThese multi-storey and multilateral channelized elements are inferred to represent deposition in active fluvial channel belts (cf. Gibling, 2006). Predominance of plane-bedded conglomerates over massive conglomerates indicates prevalence of bedload sedimentation by high-energy flows (Hassan, 2005; Hassan et al., 2009). The development of these multilateral and multistorey complexes suggests important channel mobility, possibly associated with repeated avulsions, driving the reworking of previous deposits (Hirst, 1991; Cain and Mountney, 2009). In most of the cases, especially in the lower part of the Upper Red Garumnian (intervals 1 and 2), these channelized elements present limited apparent widths, which indicates limited lateral displacement of the formative channel forms; internally, styles of vertical and, where recognizable, downstream growth are more evident, suggesting the recurrent occupation of the same channel. In contrast, more intensive lateral reworking and the occupation of more extensive floodplain areas (cf. North and Taylor, 1996) can be inferred for the upper part of the succession, from interval 3, and particularly in the Claret Conglomerate (interval 4). In the Claret Conglomerate, this change in architectural style has been interpreted as the response of the fluvial system to the PETM (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007; Domingo et al., 2009; Colombera et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018). Nonetheless, the gradual increase in the lateral extent of the FC3 elements observed in the interval 3 could imply a response of the fluvial system to allogenic factors that operated over a timescale longer than that of the PETM.\nThe local occurrence of oncolites in conglomeratic deposits of FC3 elements of the Claret Conglomerate can be associated with quiet-water conditions somewhere in the broader terrestrial environment, which allowed the growth of these coated grains in relation to microbial activity (Cojan, 1993; Arenas-Abad et al., 2010). In a similar way, the local occurrence of grey mudrocks with coaly fragments, suggest the development of ponded areas surrounded by vegetation, where organic remains were preserved thanks to locally developed reducing conditions, but where peat accumulations could not form due to the high supply of terrigenous suspended load (Takano and Waseda, 2003).\n\n\n\n\n6.2\nSediment gravity-flow deposits\nThese deposits are stratigraphically restricted and are represented by only one type of architectural element, consisting of mainly non-channelized coarse-grained bodies composed of disorganized, clast-supported conglomerates. In terms of lithofacies, these deposits can be locally similar to those of some channelized deposits, but they are coarser grained and more poorly sorted than similar massive conglomerates of streamflow origin.\n\n6.2.1\nDebris-flow deposits\n\n6.2.1.1\nDescription\nOnly 8 bodies of this type were identified in the Upper Red Garumnian in the study area, and these are restricted to the interval 2, occurring dominantly in its basal part. Usually, these bodies appear at the base of fining-upward successions and are overlain by metre-thick intervals of unconfined heterolithic elements; locally, they also occur encased within overbank deposits (see below). The maximum thickness of these debris-flow deposits ranges from 0.5\u202fm to 1.3\u202fm. These deposits occur as non-channelized bodies, with tabular to lenticular shapes, which according to their width-to-thickness ratio mostly correspond to broad ribbons and narrow sheet-like bodies (Table 2). The lower boundary of these elements varies from planar (Fig. 12A) to irregular and erosional surfaces (Fig. 12B); such surfaces usually correspond to 5th-order bounding surfaces, but depending on their position in the succession, such lower boundaries can be ranked as 6th-order surfaces, which locally define the base of the interval 2 of the Upper Red Garumnian (Fig. 12A and C). The top surface is typically flat but can locally present a convex-upward shape (Fig. 12B).\nInternally these deposits are notably homogeneous (Fig. 12A), but in some cases they can show a crude stratification by fabric defined by the alignment of discoidal clasts (Fig. 12B), or by grain size due to the occurrence of matrix-supported sectors of limited vertical (<0.3\u202fm) and lateral (<2\u202fm) extent (Fig. 12C). These deposits are mainly composed of mud-poor, clast-supported, massive conglomerates (Gcm; 77.4%); conglomerates with crude horizontal bedding (Gh: 18.3%) are also present; pebbly sandstones, also with horizontal bedding, occur more rarely (Sh: 4.3%).\n\n\n6.2.1.2\nInterpretation\nThese deposits, dominated by clast-supported, disorganized conglomerates, which are coarser grained compared to massive conglomerates of streamflow origin, represent the deposits of mass flows comparable in rheology with the non-cohesive sediment gravity (debris) flows described in numerous alluvial-fan environments (Blair and McPherson, 1994, 2009; Went, 2005). Although the occurrence of sediment gravity flows in fluvial environments is relatively uncommon (Blair and McPherson, 1994), deposits of debris flows interbedded with fluvial sediments are documented in systems from arid to semiarid climates (Graham, 1983; Jain et al., 2005; Horiuchi et al., 2009). Debris flows of this type can be formed by catastrophic discharge over loose colluvium and under arid conditions (Blair and McPherson, 2009). Available reconstructions locate the potential source areas for these deposits of the Upper Red Garumnian system at distances greater than 15\u202fkm (Capote et al., 2002; Arostegi et al., 2011). The availability of loose, coarse-grained material in these source areas, dominated by limestones and calcareous sandstones, and subject to a generally dry climate, can be postulated. A modern analogue to an alluvial catchment of this type, also dominated by limestones and influenced by a semiarid climate regime, has been described by Baker (1977). In accordance with their local palaeogeographic context, the bodies described here could represent the distal parts of extensive sheets of sediment gravity-flow deposits, reflecting their inherent ability to travel great distances over low slopes (Costa, 1984). Despite the low content of mud, some subaerial sediment gravity flows can move downslope as lobes (Mulder and Alexander, 2001), and they can exhibit concentrations of coarse clasts in their marginal parts when they accumulate as terminal lobes (Costa, 1984); the lenses and blankets of disorganized conglomerates described here might be comparable to such lobes. The limited occurrence of horizontally stratified conglomerates or sandstones on top of these massive bodies could be due to streamflow reworking (Nemec and Steel, 1984).\n\n\n\n\n6.3\nFluvial non-channelized deposits\nFluvial non-channelized deposits are the dominant constituent component of the Upper Red Garumnian: they form around 85% of the measured stratigraphic sections. Based on their geometry and constituent lithofacies, two main architectural-element types have been distinguished: (i) unconfined heterolithic elements (FH) and (ii) mud-prone overbank elements (FM).\n\n6.3.1\nUnconfined heterolithic elements (FH)\n\n6.3.1.1\nDescription\nUnconfined heterolithic elements (FH) are a notable component of the studied Upper Red Garumnian deposits, forming ~24% of the measured sections and being identified in the four defined stratigraphic intervals. These elements are most commonly located directly adjacent to or overlying channelized or debris-flow bodies. Locally, tabular bodies with similar sedimentological features, but without any observed spatial relationship with coarser-grained deposits, are also seen. In downstream (SE to SSW) profiles, these elements present a tabular (Fig. 13A) to wedge-shaped morphology (Fig. 13B); despite the good continuity of the exposures, sections oriented parallel to depositional strike are not sufficiently continuous to enable assessment of the lateral extent of these bodies; however, considering the dimensions of the underlying coarse-grained bodies, the FH elements can probably attain apparent width values from 5 to 70\u202fm. Their maximum thickness is from less than 1\u202fm to 13.5\u202fm, but is typically less than 6\u202fm. Where FH elements overlie channelized bodies, their lower boundary can correspond to low-relief, accretionary 4th-order surfaces (Fig. 13A and C); instead, where located above overbank elements, this basal boundary is usually erosional and sharp, and can be ranked as a 5th-order surface (Fig. 13B and D). In their downstream terminations, these elements can pinch out within overbank elements (Fig. 13A).\nThe FH elements are mostly composed of well stratified (planar-horizontally stratified to ripple laminated) to massive (mainly bioturbated) interbeds of very fine-grained sandstones and siltstones (lithofacies Fl: 92.7%); thin (less than 0.5\u202fm) interbeds of horizontal-bedded (Sh: 2.8%) and massive sandstones (Sm: 3.4%) are other significant components; cross-bedded sandstones were not recorded in the measured sections, but are observed locally (Fig. 13D). Local load structures are observed below such coarser-grained interbeds. The effects of bioturbation and pedogenesis are common features of these deposits. The bioturbation of beds is variable, ranging in form from discrete burrows to completely homogenized beds. Biogenic structures comprise mainly subvertical regular cylindrical burrows, although rare burrows that are meniscate, else that show midway enlargements, are observed in places. In highly bioturbated strata, horizontal burrows are also common. Common pedogenic features of these deposits, although usually restricted to red-coloured strata, are reduction spots and mottles, branched rhizohaloes, and leaf imprints (see below for additional details).\n\n\n6.3.1.2\nInterpretation\nConsidering their fine-grained size and the conspicuous occurrence of planar and ripple-lamination, the FH elements can be interpreted as the result of unconfined, decelerating, shallow-water flows in a low-relief and low-gradient alluvial-plain setting (Hubert and Hyde, 1982; Wells, 1983; Sadler and Kelly, 1993). Such overbank flows caused deposition of fine-grained bedload at the transition between lower and upper flow-regimes, along with suspended sediments (Hubert and Hyde, 1982; Stear, 1983; Parkash et al., 1983; Gulliford et al., 2014). In present-day dryland areas, the deposits of overland flows are associated with relatively high-frequency and low-magnitude flood events (Vyverberg, 2010). The preserved record of such overbank flooding events is mainly represented by wide, elongate, sheet-like bodies commonly referred to as splay deposits (Stear, 1983; McKie, 2011; Gulliford et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2014). In modern dryland areas, similar unconfined deposits are located at the termini of rivers, where they form so-called terminal splays (Abdullatif, 1989; Fisher et al., 2008; Coronel et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). The location of these deposits above the channelized elements suggest that this type of sedimentation became important once these channels were completely infilled (Schumm, 1961). In addition, their gradation to channelized deposits may indicate that the unconfined lobes were fed upstream by such channelized systems (McKie and Audretsch, 2005). Pervasive biogenic or pedogenic alteration is commonly observed in recent and ancient examples of similar deposits, and is associated with the time between flood events (Fisher et al., 2008; McKie, 2011; Burns et al., 2017). The observed vertical burrows may correspond to shelter traces, whereas horizontal burrows are typically associated with feeding processes (Hasiotis, 2002). The presence of rhizohaloes, slickensides and wedge-shaped peds suggests that, despite the dominant well-drained conditions, fluctuations in soil saturation took place. Where spatial relationships with presumed genetically related channel deposits cannot be observed, these deposits might correspond to the most distal parts of elements of this type.\n\n\n\n6.3.2\nMud-prone overbank elements (FM)\n\n6.3.2.1\nDescription\nMud-prone overbank elements (FM) are the most abundant deposits in the Upper Red Garumnian, constituting ca. 80% of the entire studied succession; they are ubiquitous in the four defined stratigraphic intervals. FM elements extend laterally over hundreds of metres, and in the measured sections can locally attain up to 70\u202fm in thickness. Where located above FH elements, the lower contact can be gradational.\nThe lithofacies of mudstones and siltstones (Fsm) is by far the dominant component of FM elements attaining an abundance of 98.7%; other components are present with abundances lower than 1% and comprise thin to medium beds (<0.5\u202fm) of very-fine grained sandstones to siltstones (Fl: 0.5%), massive to horizontally bedded sandstones (Sm: 0.2% and Sh: 0.1% respectively), and horizontally bedded conglomerates (Gh: 0.1%); pedogenic calcareous nodules (P lithofacies) occur locally in a similar low percentage (0.2%). The dominant fine-grained sediments show different degrees of pedogenic alteration, which produced palaeosols with a characteristic horizonation due to different intensities of redoximorphic features (mottling; Fig. 14a and B). Burrows and drab-haloed root traces are relatively common in these deposits. Gypsum (Fig. 14C) occurs mainly as irregular aggregates (<10\u202fcm of major dimension) of anhedral crystals, or less commonly as laminar aggregates and veinlets that probably originated by reprecipitation. Although the occurrence of gypsum is usually observed at different locations and stratigraphic levels, locally, in the western part of the Esplugafreda section and in the upper part of interval 2, such accumulations attain a higher concentration (Fig. 4), which can even be observed in aerial orthophotographs. In the outcrops near Gurp, these gypsum accumulations are locally very abundant (Fig. 14C). Calcareous nodules (individually less than 2\u202fcm) are present as accumulations in distinct horizons. A discrete carbonate layer is observed (Fig. 14D) that is less than 0.5\u202fm thick; although discontinuous, it appears in segments with up to 100\u202fm of lateral continuity; this layer is located in the middle part of interval 2 and is composed of massive to banded limestones, which locally show a nodular habit and lack macroscopic evidence of fossil content.\n\n\n6.3.2.2\nInterpretation\nBased on their grain size and overall architecture, these deposits record suspension settling associated with overbank floods flowing over distal floodplain areas to develop mudflats (Parkash et al., 1983; Stear, 1983; Wells, 1983; Cowan, 1993; Coronel et al., 2020). The episodic, but apparently frequent flooding of such areas, which covered the major part of this fluvial system, lead to the accumulation of thick and wide mud-prone successions (Parkash et al., 1983; Stear, 1983; Ghosh and Sarkar, 2011). Possible periodic flooding may be responsible for the differential mottling and banded aspects of these deposits, in relation to seasonal differences in soil saturation (Kraus, 1992). Palaeosols in the studied sections have been classified as Vertisols, but Aridisols may also be present (Fjellbirkeland, 1990). The presence of rhizoliths in these deposits suggests the existence of some vegetation, a feature common of floodplains in dryland areas (Scott, 2006; Bridge and Demicco, 2008). Gypsum precipitates in this succession were previously associated with evaporation cycles and arid conditions (Fjellbirkeland, 1990); however, a pedogenic origin mediated by bacterial activity may be more likely in view of their concentration in root holes and along slickensides fractures. The formation of Bk horizons enriched in pedogenic carbonate nodules may reflect carbonate precipitation in a floodplain setting experiencing a negative water balance and a gap in sedimentation, whereas the carbonate bed of interval 2 may represent carbonate precipitation in a palustrine setting subject to negligible input of clastic sediment (cf. Alonso-Zarza and Wright, 2010; Arostegi et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\nThe Upper Red Garumnian succession in the study area comprises mostly non-channelized fluvial elements resulting from sedimentation via unconfined mud-laden flows, principally in overbank settings neighbouring fluvial channels and represented by widespread mudflats. Based on the proportion of these deposits in the measured vertical sections, and the available chronostratigraphic framework, these alluvial mudflats were the dominant landscape in the late Paleocene in the eastern part of the Tremp-Graus basin. The channelized elements are variably distributed depending on their stratigraphic position: they tend to be broadly scattered in intervals 1 and 2, formed during a stage of tectonic quiescence; by contrast, they tend to be dominantly clustered, in some cases within palaeovalleys, in interval 3 and in the lowermost part of interval 4, as a result of changes in streambed graded profile related to reactivated uplift (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012) and eustatic changes (valley fills of Pujalte et al., 2014; cf. Colombera et al., 2017; Fig. 4). Following the onset of the PETM, with a temporal lag in the order of 4000\u202fyears (Pujalte et al., 2022) to 105\u202fyears (Duller et al., 2019), the fluvial style in this part of the basin changed drastically: during the earliest Eocene, channel belts migrated rapidly across the alluvial plain causing the cannibalization of floodplain areas, as well as the erosional planation of palaeotopographic highs (Colombera et al., 2017); after the PETM recovery, these alluvial environments reverted to their mud-prone character, under conditions of increased proximity to the coast, which heralded the establishment of marine conditions recorded by the early Eocene Alveolina Limestone and equivalent facies.\nThe documented changes in the stratigraphic architecture of the Upper Red Garumnian reflect the variable role of allogenic drivers, specifically tectonics and climate, which resulted from global scale processes (PETM) to more basin-wide controls (multistage uplift of the Pyrenees). Meanwhile, at a smaller scale, sedimentological observations from channelized elements reveal the influence of discharge variability as a control on facies architectures.\nIn most channelized elements, there is evidence of deposition by streams with significant water-discharge variability; locally, evidence of physical and biogenic processes of sediment alteration (burrowing, desiccation and root growth; Fig. 15\n) indicate ephemeral or intermittent discharge. The predominance of high-stage and upper-flow regime bedforms, mostly horizontally bedded sandstones and conglomerates, reflects the prevalence of shallow rapid flows. The intermittent nature of water discharge is additionally testified by the limited reworking of rapidly aggraded channel deposits. Certain diagnostic characteristics of rivers with highly variable discharge, such as partially buried stumps and trees (Fielding et al., 2018), are lacking; nonetheless, possible evidence of sparse vegetation colonizing the channel beds during low flow stages or droughts may be recorded by the preservation of extensive networks of sub-horizontal rhizohaloes (Fig. 15C and D).\nThe simple single-storey elements (FC1), which are frequently dominated by a single lithofacies and tend to lack reactivation surfaces or mud drapes, are interpreted as the product of channel inception and infill by a single flood. Elements of this type are thought to represent the infill of fluvial channels located in overbank-dominated alluvial-plain areas, either as isolated channels incising overbank deposits (FM), or as flow conduits that developed in the late stages of accumulation of genetically related unconfined heterolithic elements (FH). For compound single-storey elements (FC2), a detailed characterization of their internal architecture is hampered by the fact that most exposures have limited three-dimensional control; most outcropping sections are oriented approximately perpendicular to the average palaeoflow direction. Nonetheless, a record of multiple flood events affecting the same channel forms is identified in the vertical stacking of m-scale deposits of individual floods, dominated by sandy to gravelly bedforms and sand sheets deposited during high flow stages and overlain by cm- to dm-scale drapes of fine-grained sandstones and siltstones deposited by suspension settling during waning stages. Bioturbation affects the fining-upward and sandstone packages of these elements, which is especially significant in view of their inherently high water-holding capacity. Multi-storey and multilateral elements (FC3) represent the deposits of channel belts with a more complex morphodynamic evolution, encompassing the dissection and reworking of previous coarse-grained deposits and occasional channel widening; these FC3 elements tend to form the basal portion of major fining-upward successions. The channel belts that formed these bodies comprised of bedforms and elements of different types and scales, such as unit bars, gravelly and sandy bedforms, plane beds, as well as channel fills; individual storeys can be separated by scour surfaces with metric relief. Macroform-accretion geometries are particularly evident in FC2 and FC3 elements from the lower part of interval 4, including and up to the Claret Conglomerate, in conjunction with a larger fraction of facies relating to mesoform-scale bedforms. This architectural change may indicate a transition to more perennial conditions (Colombera et al., 2017; cf. Plink-Bj\u00f6rklund, 2015; Fielding et al., 2018). A substantial change in the type of lithofacies forming the Claret Conglomerate, relative to the underlying deposits of interval 4, is not seen. Yet, the Claret Conglomerate, which is a particular type of FC3 element, marks a sudden increase in the apparent width of the channelized elements (cf. Dreyer, 1993; Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007; Colombera et al., 2017). The local occurrence of fine-grained elements of limited lateral extension suggests that the change in architecture (size and stacking pattern of channel bodies) may reflect increased channel mobility and avulsion frequency.\nA limited proportion of the Upper Red Garumnian in the study area is made of deposits of sediment gravity-flows, represented by clast-supported disorganized bodies, which are mostly stratigraphically limited to the basal part of the stratigraphic interval 2. The interfingering of debris-flow deposits with fine-grained fluvial deposits has been locally reported in the Munster Basin of southern Ireland (Graham, 1983), which has been referred to as an example of an alluvial basin where debris-flow processes coexisted with braided-river deposition (Stanistreet and McCarthy, 1993). Additionally, the significant occurrence of conglomeratic deposits in relatively distal parts of this alluvial system can be related to an intrinsic factor of this sedimentary basin, namely the dominance of carbonates in the source area (Fjellbirkeland, 1990). Similar conditions are seen in modern alluvial systems developed under arid and semiarid climatic conditions in central Texas, where streams associated with limestone terrains are associated with coarse gravel and boulders that are mobilized during major floods (Baker, 1977).\nThe overbank deposits, which constitute the 85% of the succession in the study area, were formed by overbank flows during major seasonal floods or by low-energy but high-frequency mud-laden flows. Unconfined flows are dominated by very fine-grained sandstone and coarse-grained siltstone deposits, which usually show evidence of pedogenesis, including the common occurrence of burrows and rhizoliths. These characteristics might be related to transient water saturation of the soil, and to the development of riparian ecosystems. In overbank deposits, the pedogenesis is more strongly controlled by cycles of drying and wetting, and includes the development of mottled patterns and the precipitation of calcareous nodules and gypsum aggregates. Analysis of palaeosol characteristics indicates the predominance of a dry climate, important seasonal variations in moisture, as well as a progressive increase in precipitation through the time of interval 3. The red-coloured nature of the overbank deposits of intervals 1 to 3 suggests prevailing well-drained conditions during the deposition of most of the Upper Red Garumnian. Nonetheless, in the lower part of interval 4, (members 1 to 2 of the Claret Formation of Baceta et al., 2011), the occurrence of grey-coloured fine-grained deposits with coaly fragments testifies to the existence of waterlogged areas that enabled organic matter preservation in relation to reducing conditions. In addition, the conglomeratic deposits forming the amalgamated complexes of the Claret Conglomerate of Baceta et al. (2011) contain oncolites (Fig. 16\n), which may be associated with shallow ponded areas neighbouring or within the channel belts that produced the coarse-grained bodies. These features indicate that the lower interval 4 recorded a change to poorly drained conditions, which could also be responsible for the apparently higher degree of cementation observed in the conglomeratic deposits of this interval, due to a shallower phreatic zone. A water-table rise would have occurred as part of a long-term trend of palaeohydrological change that predated the onset of the PETM, and which is expressed in interval 3 in palaeosol characteristics that indicate a seasonal increase in precipitation. Overall, this may reflect some progressive intensification of the hydrologic cycle in the study area during the late Paleocene warming trend (cf. Bice and Marotzke, 2002; Kender et al., 2012).\nTo summarize our sedimentological characterization of the succession, a sedimentological model is proposed for the Upper Red Garumnian (Fig. 17\n) that depicts schematically the distribution of the architectural elements across the four described intervals. Compound single-storey (FC2) and amalgamated complexes (FC3) are associated with wide areas of unconfined heterolithic deposits. Debris-flow elements (DF) are only found in the interval 2, and specifically at its base. Palaeosol horizons with calcareous nodules are common in mud-prone overbank deposits, particularly those of the interval 2. The base of the interval 3 is marked by local amalgamated complexes, but in overlying strata the channelized bodies tend to be clustered (Figs. 3, 4), suggesting the influence of topographic (e.g., valley confinement) or autogenic (e.g., presence of avulsion nodes) controls on their distribution (cf. Hajek et al., 2010). The Claret Conglomerate records channel-belt amalgamation by lateral migration of individual channels. Poorly drained conditions are locally interpreted for the Claret Conglomerate and the underlying lower interval 4 deposits in the Esplugafreda area, where ponded areas within channel belts and water-logged zones in overbank areas existed.\nIn summary, variations in water discharge are recognized to have occurred over a range of timescales (from that of flood events to that of the late Paleocene warming trend): these left distinctive sedimentary records at corresponding spatial scales (from that of the lithofacies to that of the entire Upper Red Garumnian), which indicate that climate was a prime control on the flow characteristics, depositional processes, channel morphodynamics, palaeosol development and topographic evolution of the studied alluvial system. To elucidate the significance and magnitude of the inferred environmental change, however, it is recommended that quantitative palaeohydraulic and palaeohydrological reconstructions (cf. Paredes et al., 2018; Long, 2021; Barefoot et al., 2022), ideally supported by geochemical analyses (cf. Sheldon et al., 2002), are undertaken.\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nBased on the analysis of its architecture and lithofacies characteristics, the late Paleocene to earliest Eocene fluvial succession exposed in the Ar\u00e9n-Esplugafreda sector \u2013 the Upper Red Garumnian\u2013 is shown to have characteristics comparable to those of the distal parts of other ancient and modern fluvial systems developed in dryland environments. Based on field mapping and the measurement of stratigraphic sections, four stratigraphic intervals (1 to 4 from base to top) have been defined in this succession. Channelized architectural elements comprise coarse-grained bodies produced by both streamflow and sediment gravity-flow processes; they account for ca. 15% of the cumulative measured stratigraphy, and exhibit significant variability in external geometries and styles of internal architecture. The Upper Red Garumnian is, however, dominated by fine-grained non-channelized strata that formed over wide areas of the original alluvial plain.\nA detailed analysis of the stratigraphic architecture and facies organization of these deposits has revealed how water-discharge variations at different temporal scales acted as a fundamental control on the characteristics and evolution of this alluvial system. Facies arrangements and evidence of streambed drying are documented: these record the effects of highly variable discharge in ephemeral or intermittent channels, over timescales ranging from that of flood events to that of channel-form lifespans. Variations in facies assemblages, stratigraphic architecture and palaeosol characteristics through the stratigraphy testify to longer-term variations in channel morphodynamics, discharge regime, floodplain processes and pedogenesis; since these may reflect major hydrological changes in the late Paleocene and earliest Eocene, the findings of this work help improve our understanding of environmental change leading to, and including, the PETM.\n\n","52":"","53":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nReconstructing the history of climate and sea-level changes during the Quaternary is of prime importance for better addressing potential anthropogenic climate changes. To unravel this history, we investigate the record of shallow-water tropical carbonates because of their sensitivity to subtle environmental fluctuations (e.g., Lees and Buller, 1972; Mutti and Hallock, 2003; James and Jones, 2015 and references therein), their ability to preserve past sea-level indicators due to rapid cementation (Dravis, 1996; Friedman, 1998; Kindler and Mazzolini, 2001), and their accessibility to multiple dating methods (e.g., Hearty and Kaufman, 2000; Thompson et al., 2011). Further, peritidal limestones from tectonically quiescent areas, such as the Bahamas, are particularly suitable for assessing ancient sea-level markers because the elevation uncertainties related to subsidence or uplift rates are minimal at these locations.\nHowever, because the geology of these carbonate islands is relatively complex (e.g., Garrett and Gould, 1984; Hearty and Kindler, 1993a and 1993b, 1997; Carew and Mylroie, 1995a, 1997; Hearty, 1998; Godefroid, 2012; Dravis and Wanless, 2017; Kerans et al., 2019), correlating depositional phases to specific sea-level events is not always a straightforward task. A case in point is the stratigraphic record from the Late Pleistocene (i.e., Marine Isotope Stage [MIS] 5; ca. 132\u201374\u202fka BP; Railsback et al., 2015). This time interval encompasses several sedimentation episodes represented by reefal, shoreface and foreshore deposits, as well as by eolianites of both skeletal and oolitic composition. One school of thought (e.g., Carew and Mylroie, 1995a, 1997, 2001; Mylroie, 2008; Yanes and Romanek, 2013; Martin et al., 2020) considers that all these sediments were accumulated during the last interglacial period (LIG, MIS 5e, ca. 132\u2013118\u202fka BP; Railsback et al., 2015), whereas the other (e.g., Hearty and Kindler, 1993a and 1993b; Kindler and Hearty, 1995, 1996, 1997; Hearty, 1998; Godefroid, 2012; Jackson, 2017; Vimpere, 2017; Godefroid et al., 2019) correlates part of this record, namely the skeletal eolianites, to MIS 5a (ca. 88\u201374\u202fka BP; Railsback et al., 2015). On San Salvador Island, Hearty and Kindler (1993a) coined the term Almgreen Cay Formation (ACF) for these eolianites, which actually corresponded to a morphostratigraphic unit, i.e., a body of rock essentially defined by its surface form and lithology (Bowen, 1988).\nIn this paper, we officially rename, redefine, and supplant the ACF as the Whale Point Formation (WPF) based on more than 30\u202fyears of geological investigations across the Bahamian archipelago. The two objectives of this study are thus: (1) to formally describe the WPF as a lithostratigraphic unit, and (2) to address the implications of the recognition of this formation as a record of climate and sea level during MIS 5a.\n\n\n2\nGeographic and geological setting of the Bahamas\nThe Bahamas archipelago, including the Turks and Caicos islands, extends for nearly 1000\u202fkm (ca. 7\u00b0 of latitude) in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 1\n). It stands on the passive southeastern margin of the North American plate, but is fairly close to the (active) northern Caribbean plate boundary zone. This region has long been considered as tectonically stable, and only affected by slow subsidence related to sedimentary loading (ca. 2\u202fcm\/kyr in the northern Bahamas since the Oligocene; Lynts, 1970). More recent studies (Mullins and Van Buren, 1981; Masaferro and Eberli, 1999; Kindler et al., 2011; Mulder et al., 2012), however, suggest that the area has been affected by several tectonic episodes during the Neogene and even in the Quaternary.\nThe archipelago consists of a series of flat-topped, steep-sided carbonate platforms (i.e., banks) separated by deep channels (Fig. 1). Its northeastern part essentially comprises two large edifices (Little Bahama Bank and Great Bahama Bank) that are largely flooded, and bear elongated, low-elevation islands, mostly on their eastern (windward) sides (e.g., Abaco, Eleuthera). Its southeastern portion shows several smaller banks that are only marginally submerged, and often capped by relatively large islands (e.g., Mayaguana and Great Inagua banks). This morphological difference is likely due to increasing tectonic influence towards the south (Mullins et al., 1991, 1992). Except for Cay Sal Bank (Fig. 1; Hine and Steinmetz, 1984), water depth seldom exceeds 8 to 12\u202fm on the flooded parts of the bank tops (e.g., Harris et al., 2015). The platform margins represent gently sloping (3 to 20\u00b0; Wilber et al., 1990; Grammer et al., 1991; Rankey and Doolittle, 2012) intervals between the platform interior and the bank edges (i.e., the greatest seaward increase in gradient; Playton et al., 2010) which occur at 20 to 60\u202fm below sea level (Bergman et al., 2010), and generally tower above sub-vertical escarpments. The width of the platform margins varies from a few 100's of m to up to 4\u202fkm along the windward and leeward sides of the banks, respectively (Wilber et al., 1990; Jackson, 2017).\nThe largest part of Bahamas region is located in the tropical savanna climate zone of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification (Aw; Beck et al., 2018). The northern (e.g., Abaco) and the southern portions (e.g., Great Inagua, eastern Mayaguana) of the archipelago are respectively positioned in the tropical monsoon (Am) and hot steppe climate zones (Bsh; Beck et al., 2018). All areas experience two main seasons largely determined by the movements of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In the winter, the southward motion of the ITCZ induces temperate-warm and dry conditions over the archipelago with prevailing NE trade winds and cold western fronts. By contrast, in the summer, its northward shift results in a hot and humid climate with weaker trade winds from the E and SE (Zhuravleva and Bauch, 2018). The average yearly rainfall is ca. 850\u202fmm, but regional variations range from 660\u202fmm to 1450\u202fmm\/yr (Sealey, 2006).\nThe ca. 700 islands and cays of the Bahamas consist of vertically stacked and\/or laterally juxtaposed carbonate units, mostly eolianites, separated by thin red to brown layers generally corresponding to terra-rossa paleosols. The latter are composed of a mix of carbonates and of an insoluble clay fraction primarily derived from atmospheric aerosols (Muhs et al., 1990; Nawratil de Bono, 2008). Relying on a depositional model developed in Bermuda (Bretz, 1960; Vacher, 1973), Carew and Mylroie (1995a, 2001) surmised that carbonate sediments accumulate during interglacial highstands of sea level, when the platform tops are flooded by a shallow water layer, and that paleosols mostly form during lowstands, when the banks are exposed. They further envisioned three phases of eolianite deposition related to their time of origin during a highstand. These phases, labeled \u201ctransgressive\u201d, \u201cstillstand\u201d and \u201cregressive\u201d, correspond to the early part, the acme and the late part of the flooding event, respectively. In this model, eolianites of all phases are closely tied to their source beaches.\nStratigraphic research on the Bahamas islands began in the early 1980's with the landmark paper of Garrett and Gould (1984) on New Providence. Around that time, three allostratigraphic units were defined by Carew and Mylroie (1985) on San Salvador: the Owl's Hole, the Grotto Beach, and the Rice Bay formations (Table 1\n). Carew and Mylroie's (1985) stratigraphic scheme was largely maintained by its authors during the next two decades while concurrent investigations on other islands (e.g., Hearty and Kindler 1993a and 1993b, 1997; Kindler and Hearty, 1995, 1996, 1997; Hearty, 1998; Kindler, 1995) identified six carbonate-paleosol \u201ccouplets\u201d (Hearty and Kaufman, 2000), spanning a time interval from the Middle Pleistocene (MIS 13) to the Holocene. More recently, geological research on Mayaguana and Crooked islands revealed the occurrence of rock units predating the Middle Pleistocene, and going as far back as the Early Miocene (Fig. 2\n, Table 1; Kindler et al., 2011; Godefroid, 2012; Godefroid and Kindler, 2016; Godefroid et al., 2019).\n\n\n3\nMethods\nOver the years, we used a multi-method approach to unravel the stratigraphy of the Bahamas islands including morphostratigraphy, stratigraphy, sedimentology and quantitative petrographic analysis, as well as amino-acid racemization, U-series, 87Sr\/86Sr, and 14C dating. The methods specifically pertaining to the recognition of the WPF are briefly described below.\n\n3.1\nMorphostratigraphy\nPrior to fieldwork, we evaluated the morphostratigraphy on topographic maps and air photos applying the principles of lateral accretion (Itzhaki, 1961; Vacher, 1973) and catenary growth (Garrett and Gould, 1984). The former states that, on a prograding shoreline, deposits become younger seaward. The latter principle, which is an exception to the first one, asserts that catenary ridges are younger than their anchoring headlands (Fig. 2 in Kindler and Hearty, 1996).\n\n\n3.2\nStratigraphy and sedimentology\nMeasured sections were established at 28 sites on 11 islands (Fig. 1). When exposed, boundaries with underlying and overlying stratigraphic units were scrutinized in details. Physical and biogenic sedimentary structures were examined in the field to obtain information about depositional settings and, eventually, past sea-level elevation.\n\n\n3.3\nPetrography\nFollowing examination in the field, selected samples were collected from the studied sections, impregnated with blue epoxy resin, thin-sectioned and observed under a polarizing microscope. Carbonate minerals were identified by staining techniques (Miller, 1988), and quantitative petrographic analysis was made with a SWIFT automatic point-counter (model F). The applied analytical method is thoroughly described in Kindler and Hearty (1996).\n\n\n3.4\nAmino-acid racemization (AAR) dating\nAAR dating was used on whole-rock samples for correlating units within and between islands, and determining their relative ages. The method relies on the slow interconversion (racemization) of L-amino acids, within indigenous proteins preserved in the sample, to increasing proportions of their respective D-configurations until an equilibrium mixture of D- and L-amino acids is attained. This study utilized the ratio of the stereoisomers of isoleucine (D-alloisoleucine\/L-isoleucine or A\/I ratio). The A\/I ratio is zero in most living tissues (D-alloisoleucine is not present), and approaches an equilibrium value of 1.3 at an exponentially decreasing rate depending on the time elapsed since the death of the constituent organisms and the temperature history of the sedimentary deposit. All samples were sent for analysis to the Amino Acid Geochronology Laboratory of the Northern Arizona University. Prior to 2013, A\/I ratios were directly measured with the traditional, labor intensive, ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography method. More recently, A\/I ratios were calculated from the D\/L ratios of valine measured with the automated reverse-phase chromatography technique using the equations established by Whitacre et al. (2017). More information on these diverse analytical methods and sample preparation can be found in Hearty and Kaufman (2000, 2009), Hearty (2010) and Kerans et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n4\nDefinition and description of the Whale Point Formation\nIn the following sections, we formally define the Whale Point Formation as a new unit in the lithostratigraphic record of the Bahamas archipelago.\n\n4.1\nOrigin of the name\nThe name of this new formation is derived from that of the apex of a NNW-SSE trending headland in the northern part of Eleuthera Island (toponymy from the topographic map Eleuthera, sheet 3, scale 1:25,000; Bahamas Government, 1969).\n\n\n4.2\nHolostratotype and parastratotype\nBoth the holostratotype and the parastratotype of the WPF are to be found on Eleuthera Island. The former is situated on the aforementioned Whale Point headland (N25\u00b027\u203228.94\u2033; W76\u00b037\u203209.98\u2033), the latter corresponds to a rocky cove called the Boiling Hole or Queen's Bath (N25\u00b025\u203256.90\u2033; W76\u00b035\u203251.63\u2033) positioned on the Atlantic coast of North Eleuthera about 3.5\u202fkm SE of Whale Point. These sections are scrupulously described as an appendix.\n\n\n4.3\nHistory\nAs previously mentioned, this unit was first identified on San Salvador, and named the Almgreen Cay Formation by Hearty and Kindler (1993a). These deposits typically consist of paleosol-capped skeletal eolianites, and were correlated with MIS 5a because of their position (seaward of landforms dated to MIS 5e) and the results of AAR dating. This addition to the Bahamian stratigraphic record known at that time generated much controversy in the subsequent years (Carew and Mylroie, 1994; Hearty and Kindler, 1994; Carew and Mylroie, 1995a and 1995b) mostly because, on San Salvador, stratigraphic relationships are not straightforward. Exposures showing the ACF overlying MIS 5e rocks, but separated from the latter by an intervening paleosol, were later observed at several localities in Eleuthera (Hearty and Kindler, 1995a; Hearty, 1998), but the controversy persisted as several following authors (Carew and Mylroie, 2001; Panuska et al., 2002; Mylroie, 2008) correlated these deposits with the sea-level fall at the end of the LIG. The ACF was informally renamed \u201cWhale Point Formation\u201d by Kindler et al. (2010), and this name was used in several subsequent papers (Godefroid, 2012; Godefroid et al., 2019; Jackson, 2017).\n\n\n4.4\nDescription\n\n4.4.1\nGeomorphological characteristics\nThe WPF forms moderate-elevation ridges (up to 15\u202fm high) that are always located on the bank margins, a few 100's of m to up to 2\u202fkm landward of the platform edges. Generally, these ridges have been partly eroded during the Holocene transgression, and appear as a series of headlands attached to a main island (e.g., Crab Cay - Almgreen Cay - The Bluff in San Salvador; Fig. 3\n) or as chains of small islets (e.g., Booby Rocks on Mayaguana Bank; Fig. 4\n). These outcrops commonly form anchors for subsequent deposits of Holocene and modern age (Figs. 3 and 4).\n\n\n4.4.2\nSedimentological characteristics\nThe WPF exposures display many medium- and large-scale cross bedding, the most conspicuous of which are tabular-planar and wedge-planar sets of steeply dipping, cm-thick foresets (Fig. 5\n). Set thickness cannot always be precisely measured as the foreset bases may be located below sea level. On the average, it varies between 0.5 and more than 5\u202fm. Foresets are slightly convex upward, and usually dip landward with an angle between 30 and 35\u00b0. Thick sets of low-angle (10 to 15\u00b0) cross-beds and planar beds also occur, particularly on the seaward side and in the upper portions of the WPF ridges (Fig. 5). These sets generally truncate the high-angle cross-beds (Fig. 5). At a smaller scale, mm-thin climbing translatent stratification (CTS) and grainfall lamination, as well as cm-thick sandflow cross-strata (Hunter, 1977; Loucks and Ward, 2001) can also be observed. Notable networks of calcrete-cored rhizoliths (i.e., rhizocretions, Klappa, 1980) may penetrate the upper part of the WPF down to a depth of 3\u202fm (Fig. 6a). At some exposures, the uppermost sets of the formation comprise m-scale, hollow cylinders up to 30\u202fcm in diameter (i.e, megarhizoliths, Alonso-Zarza et al., 2008; Fig. 6b) that locally protrude at the surface.\n\n\n4.4.3\nLithological characteristics\nThe WPF consists of laminated, medium- to coarse-grained, friable, yellowish bioclastic calcarenites. Diagnostic pink fragments of the encrusting foraminifer Homotrema rubrum (Fig. 7b) can frequently be observed with a hand lens. These calcarenites are best described as loosely packed skeletal grainstones. The percentage of bioclasts is high (79.8%; n\u202f=\u202f20; Kindler and Hearty, 1996). Benthic and encrusting foraminifers, red and green algae (e.g., Halimeda sp.), corals, echinoids, and mollusks (bivalves and gastropods) represent the most common biogenic fragments (Fig. 7a). Soritidae (e.g., Archaias aff. angulatus, Fig. 7c) and Miliolidae (e.g., Quinqueloculina sp., Triloculina aff. quadrilateralis, Triloculina aff. rotunda; Pyrgo sp., Fig. 7d) are the main families of benthic foraminifers observed in the WPF. Amphisteginidae (e.g., Amphistegina aff. lessonii) and Textulariidae (e.g., Textularia aff. candeiana) occur in a few samples, whereas planktonic foraminifers have never been observed. Ooids, oolite lithoclasts and peloids may be found near the base of the formation at some sites.\nWPF rocks exclusively contain aragonite, high- and low-Mg calcite (LMC). Considering the nature of constituent particles and the amount of cement, the percentage of LMC can be estimated between 5 and 10%, and that of metastable carbonate minerals between 90 and 95%. Allochems are usually well preserved, but some grain leaching and micritization may be observed in a few samples. Cement percentage is very low (between 0 and 8.6%; n\u202f=\u202f20; Kindler and Hearty, 1996). Cement is generally composed of small (<20\u202f\u03bcm) crystals of LMC forming menisci (Fig. 7a) and dripstones between and beneath grains, respectively. Microcrystalline \u201cgrain-skin cement\u201d (Land et al., 1967) may also be present in some samples. WPF rocks are very porous. Predominant porosities are of intergranular (close to 40%; Kindler and Hearty, 1996) and intragranular type. Sparse micromoldic porosity may also occur in some samples.\n\n\n4.4.4\nGeochemical characteristics\nWhole-rock AAR data obtained from the WPF samples (n\u202f=\u202f35) are reported in Table 2\n. The average of alloisoleucine\/isoleucine (A\/I) values from the retained samples (n\u202f=\u202f33) is 0.301\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.042. As demonstrated in previous studies for this and other Bahamian units (Hearty and Kaufman, 2000, 2009), there is a gradual increase in A\/I values from the northern islands (e.g., Abaco, A\/I\u202f=\u202f0.280) to the southern reaches of the archipelago (e.g., Long, average A\/I\u202f=\u202f0.317).\n\nBeier (1987) obtained the following geochemical data from WPF calcarenites (n\u202f=\u202f4) collected at The Bluff (San Salvador): Al and Fe occur in extremely low concentrations; MgO\u202f=\u202f2.5 to 3.0\u202fwt%; Sr\u202f=\u202f3000\u202fppm; \u03b413C\u202f=\u202f+2 per mil; \u03b418O\u202f=\u202f\u22122 per mil; TOC\u202f=\u202f0.1%. Similar isotopic values were more recently obtained from exposures in Eleuthera and Long Island (L. Vimpere, pers. comm. 2021).\n\n\n\n4.5\nFacies variations\nAt several sites (e.g., The Bluff, San Salvador, Fig. 8a), the WPF encompasses a thin, subhorizontal layer devoid of physical sedimentary structures that commonly includes cm-sized calcitic nodules, rhizocretions and numerous shells of the terrestrial gastropod Cerion sp. (Fig. 8b). The petrographic composition of this layer is identical to that of the rest of the WPF. However, grain leaching and needle-fiber calcite cement are more common in the former than in the latter. According to Beier (1987), the Al and Fe concentrations are slightly higher in this deposit than in the cross-bedded strata; MgO\u202f=\u202f1.5\u202fwt%; Sr\u202f=\u202f3000\u202fppm; \u03b413C\u202f=\u202f\u22123 per mil; \u03b418O\u202f=\u202f\u22124 per mil; TOC\u202f=\u202f0.1%.\n\n\n4.6\nMacrofossil content\nShells of Cerion sp. are the only macrofossils found in the WPF. These shells essentially occur in the thin layers devoid of physical sedimentary structures described in the previous section. According to Hearty et al. (1993), WPF Cerion group from San Salvador is characterized by a large shell and limited axial ribbing. However, a more recent study (Hearty and Schellenberg, 2008) shows that Cerion sp. found in the WPF are highly variable in size, shape, colour and ornamentation. Moreover, efforts to identify this land snail specifically have been hampered by the lack of consensus with respect to species-level taxonomy (Hearty and Schellenberg, 2008).\n\n\n4.7\nBoundaries\n\n4.7.1\nUpper boundary\nThe upper limit the WPF is always sharp, and usually corresponds to the lithosphere - atmosphere boundary (Fig. 6a). At some localities, however, the formation is overlain by sub-recent sands (Fig. 9a) or by the Rice Bay Formation (Holocene). In all cases, the upper reaches of the WPF reveal a complex terra-rossa paleosol comprising laminated micritic crusts, breccia horizons and rhizocretions (Figs. 6a and 9a).\n\n\n4.7.2\nLower boundary\nThe basal limit of the WPF is rarely visible as it is generally located below sea level. Where exposed, it separates the WPF from the underlying Grotto Beach Formation that has been dated to MIS 5e (Chen et al., 1991; Thompson et al., 2011). The lower boundary of the WPF is sharp. The formation overlies either a carbonate paleosol developed at the top of the Grotto Beach Formation (Fig. 9b; Nawratil de Bono, 2008), or a karstic surface carved into the latter unit (Fig. 9c and d). Between 5 and 40\u202fcm thick, the paleosol includes a basal micritic crust overlain by a breccia layer (Ck horizon). The breccia blocks show a fitted fabric (Fig. 9b), and consist of oolitic grainstone separated and overlain by a pink, friable, sandy matrix (B horizon) comprising a pedogenized mix of bioclasts and ooids. Predominant minerals are calcite and aragonite; the clay content of this matrix amounts to less than 5% (Brentini, 2008; Nawratil de Bono, 2008).\n\n\n\n4.8\nDimensions and geographic extent of the WPF\nWPF exposures have been identified on Abaco, Grand Bahama, Gun Cay (Bimini Islands), New Providence, Eleuthera, Cat, Long, San Salvador, Rum Cay and the Exuma Chain (Fig. 1). The formation appears to be missing from Andros and, except for Mayaguana (Godefroid, 2012), from the islands forming the southern part of the Bahamian archipelago (Crooked, Acklins, Great Inagua) as well as from those standing on the Caicos platform (e.g., West Caicos; Kerans et al., 2019). The WPF has thus a wide horizontal extent (more than 600\u202fkm), but exposures are discontinuous and the visible thickness of the formation does not generally exceed 15\u202fm.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nAge of the Whale Point Formation\nSeveral attempts have been made to use paleontological criteria (i.e., Cerion sp. snails) for establishing the stratigraphy of the Bahamas islands (e.g., Garrett and Gould, 1984). However, these efforts have been mostly unsuccessful because of the very large number (ca. 600) of Cerion species (http:\/\/invertebrates.si.edu\/cerion), and the influence of geographical and ecological factors on the snail morphology (Rose, 1983; Carew and Mylroie, 1995a; Gould, 1997; Hearty, 2010). As demonstrated among pre-Columbian to historical populations of Cerion sp. highly mixed by human agencies, there is prolific hybridization locally and among islands. These features suggest that anagenesis (morphological change) rather than cladogenesis (speciation) is the determinate process in shell morphology, thus bringing into question the accuracy of the actual taxonomic identification.\nNonetheless, its stratigraphic position between a discontinuity (paleosol or karstic surface) developed at the top of rock bodies radiometrically dated to the LIG (Fig. 9c) and a glacial paleosol capped by Holocene deposits (Fig. 9a) undoubtedly indicates that the WPF was formed after MIS 5e, but before the deposition of the earliest Holocene sediments, i.e., between ca. 118 and 7\u202fka BP. As sedimentation only takes place on Bahamian banks when they are fully or partially submerged, the deposition of the WPF must have occurred during one of the two major sea-level events that characterize the abovementioned time interval: the MIS 5c (ca. 100\u202fka BP) or the MIS 5a (ca. 80\u202fka BP) high stands. Finally, margins of error considered, 27 out of the 35 obtained whole-rock A\/I ratios (i.e., 77%; Table 2) correspond to aminozone C (0.25\u202f<\u202fA\/I\u202f<\u202f0.35), which is correlated to MIS 5a (Hearty and Kaufman, 2000, 2009). When excluding the samples from Mayaguana, that likely experienced a different temperature history due to the nature of the exposure (Fig. 4), this percentage increases to 86%. The AAR geochronology might not be as renowned as the UTh and 14C dating methods, but it has proven to be invaluable for assessing ages to rock units than cannot be dated with the latter techniques (e.g., Harmon et al., 1983; Hearty et al., 1992; Hearty and Kaufman, 2000, 2009; Murray-Wallace et al., 2016).\n\n\n5.2\nGenesis of the Whale Point Formation\nAll skeletal grains comprising the WPF are of marine origin. However, the displayed physical sedimentary structures (e.g., large-scale cross bedding, Fig. 5; CTS) collectively and unambiguously identify this unit as a wind-deposited sand body. That the WPF was formed in a subaerial setting is further confirmed by the presence of terrestrial gastropods and the widespread occurrence of rhizocretions (Fig. 6). The original morphology of the WPF has been considerably altered by coastal erosion and karst denudation since MIS 5a. Satellite imagery and field mapping nevertheless show that it comprised moderate-elevation (15 to 20\u202fm) transverse dunes (e.g., along the eastern coast of San Salvador, Fig. 3), that can be interpreted as precipitation ridges (Hesp et al., 2005), and narrow dune fields supporting low-elevation \u201chaystack\u201d landforms (e.g., Whale Point - Boiling Hole area; see appendix). The predominance of large-scale, steeply dipping foresets and their position above a paleosol, both indicate that the WPF eolianites are fossil \u201ctransgressive\u201d (Hesp et al., 2005) or \u201cadvancing\u201d (Mauz et al., 2013; Rowe and Bristow, 2015a and 2015b) dunes, i.e., dunes that encroached inland, and were decoupled from their source beaches. The occurrence of truncated large-scale foresets overlain by low-angle cross-beds (Fig. 5) has been observed elsewhere (Rowe and Bristow, 2015a and 2015b), and interpreted as representing dune advance (foresets), stoss-slope erosion (truncation surface), and dune accretion (low-angle cross-beds). Modern advancing dunes are few in the Bahamas, but some have been observed by the senior author in the dryer southeastern portion of the archipelago (Fig. 10\n). Cement geometries and crystal size indicate that early diagenesis took place in the meteoric vadose environment. The high proportion of unstable minerals still present in the WPF further suggests that the formation was subsequently protected by an aquiclude (i.e., the overlying calcrete; Ward, 1973, 1997). The fairly elevated Sr concentration confirms the presence of pristine aragonitic bioclasts within the host rock, whereas the \u03b413C and the \u03b418O values reflect the marine origin of the allochems and the influence of fresh-water diagenesis, respectively.\nThe dm-thick layers devoid of physical sedimentary structures interspersed in the WPF (Fig. 8a) have been caused by pedogenic alteration as indicated by the occurrence of rhizocretions, calcitic nodules and abundant shells of Cerion (Fig. 8b). These layers have been designated as \u201cpisolitic paleosols\u201d (Brown, 1984), \u201cimmature caliche profiles\u201d (Beier, 1987) or \u201cprotosols\u201d (Hearty and Kindler, 1993a). The slight increase in Al and Fe content, the decrease in MgO concentration and the more depleted isotopic values (Beier, 1987), all signify that these layers have been exposed to the input of atmospheric dust and to fresh-water diagenetic processes for a longer time than the eolian sands of the WPF.\n\n\n5.3\nCorrelations\nThe WPF can confidently be correlated with the Mujeres Eolianite exposed in the NE part of the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico; Ward, 1973, 1975, 1997; Kelley et al., 2011). This unit displays geomorphological, sedimentological and petrographic characteristics that are analogous to those of the WPF, and further occurs in a comparable setting and morphostratigraphic position. The Mujeres Eolianite has not been dated yet, but it is considered as the youngest Pleistocene dune ridge of that area, and thought to have been deposited during the regressive phase of MIS 5e, MIS 5c or MIS 5a (Ward, 1997).\nThe WPF can be largely related to the Southampton Formation (SF) outcropping in Bermuda (Land et al., 1967; Vacher and Hearty, 1989; Vacher et al., 1995; Vacher and Rowe, 1997; Hearty, 2002). This unit is however far more complex than the WPF. The SF comprises one main eolian body which includes several protosols and forms ridges up to 60\u202fm high. This prominent eolianite is onlapped downdip by coarse-grained, coral and shell-rich marine deposits exposed at around 1\u202fm above sea level, and overlain by a 10\u202fm-high regressive eolianite. The eolian facies of the SF are very similar to that of the WPF, although constituent grains are in general more rounded in the former than in the latter. By contrast, equivalent marine facies are missing in the WPF, which is likely related to glacio-hydro-isostatic processes (Potter and Lambeck, 2003; Wainer et al., 2017; see Section 5.6.). The main part of the SF has been assigned to MIS 5c and\/or MIS 5a on the basis of AAR data (Harmon et al., 1983; Hearty et al., 1992), and the overlying marine and eolian sediments to the late portion of MIS 5a based on both AAR measurements (Vacher and Hearty, 1989; Hearty et al., 1992) and a number of UTh dates on Oculina coral fragments (Harmon et al., 1983; Ludwig et al., 1996; Muhs et al., 2002, 2020). These geochronological data are consistent with those obtained from the WPF.\nBy contrast, except for the correspondence in age, the WPF markedly differs from the MIS 5a record on Grand Cayman. Indeed, Unit F of the Ironshore Formation consists of cross-bedded oolitic grainstones deposited under marine conditions and exposed up to +5\u202fm above sea level (Coyne et al., 2007). This discrepancy has yet to be further investigated, but it might be related to the method applied to date this unit (U-series dating on mollusk shells).\n\n\n5.4\nSignificance of the WPF for Bahamian stratigraphy\nAs mentioned in Section 4.3., our addition of the WPF (previously ACF) to the stratigraphic record of the Bahamas islands in the early 1990's (Hearty and Kindler, 1993a and 1993b) was denied at that time, because the definition of this unit was perceived as solely based on morphological criteria and AAR data (Carew and Mylroie, 1995a, 1997, 2001). The formal description of the WPF presented in this paper hopefully closes this debate. The WPF comprises distinctive depositional phases, defined by numerous criteria, that occurred during MIS 5a. These eolianites do not represent a lowering of sea level at the end of MIS 5e (Carew and Mylroie, 1995a, 1997, 2001), and thus must not be assigned to the Grotto Beach Formation. That said, eolian and foreshore deposits accumulated during the late MIS 5e regression are common across the Bahamas (e.g., Gerhardt, 1983; White and Curran, 1995; Godefroid, 2012; Kerans et al., 2019). However, they are mostly composed of ooids and peloids (Kindler and Hearty, 1996; Kerans et al., 2019), and are generally superposed or off-lapping older MIS 5e rock bodies. The nearly pure skeletal composition of the WPF deposits characterizes another sedimentation phase that clearly differs from those of MIS 5e.\n\n\n5.5\nConstraints on the elevation of relative sea level in the Bahamas during MIS 5a\nThe highest elevation of relative sea level (RSL) in the Bahamas during MIS 5a has long been a matter of controversy. The results of UTh dating performed on submerged speleothems from Grand Bahama (Li et al., 1989; Lundberg and Ford, 1994) and Andros (Richards et al., 1994) show that peak RSL reached no higher than 18 to 15\u202fm below present at that time, which agrees with estimates relying on uplifted-coral (e.g., Potter et al., 2004) and oxygen-isotope (Waelbroeck et al., 2002; Spratt and Lisiecki, 2016) data. By contrast, assuming that the WPF (then ACF) eolianites were tied to their source beaches, Hearty and Kindler (1993a, 1995b) and Hearty and Kaufman (2000) proposed that RSL was within 0 to \u22125\u202fm of the modern datum during the formation of this unit. Our recognition of these landforms as advancing dunes justifies to reconsider this assessment.\nThe elevation of RSL in the Bahamas during MIS 5a, can be roughly estimated from the constituent particles of the WPF. The lack of planktonic foraminifers and the scarcity of robust amphisteginidae among bioclasts preclude to place the locus of formation of these grains on a submerged forereef terrace near the platform edge (Hallock and Glenn, 1986), as should have been the case if sea level had been at ca. 15 to 18\u202fm below the present one (Li et al., 1989; Lundberg and Ford, 1994; Richards et al., 1994). The repeated occurrence of Homotrema rubrum fragments in the WPF eolianites indicates a certain proximity to reefal areas (Rose and Lidz, 1977; Gischler and M\u00f6der, 2009). Furthermore, the presence of numerous debris of soritidae and miliolidae suggests the existence of water bodies landward of the reefs because these foraminifers thrive in quiet and shallow, seagrass-floored, lagoonal areas (Rose and Lidz, 1977; Li and Jones, 1997). Thus, the constitutive bioclasts of the WPF were probably formed in narrow lagoons behind platform-margin reefs. The petrographic composition of the WPF is further characterized by the lack of ooids, excepting those reworked from the underlying or laterally juxtaposed Grotto Beach Formation. Bahamian-type ooids form in well-agitated, warm, and shallow waters supersaturated in CaCO3 (Bathurst, 1975; Rankey and Reeder, 2011; James and Jones, 2015; Harris et al., 2019). The occurrence of hermatypic coral fragments in the WPF shows that bank waters must have been sufficiently warm and supersaturated in CaCO3 at that time to trigger the precipitation of ooids. The absence of these particles in the WPF is thus likely related to unfavorable hydrodynamic conditions. Indeed, the water layer on the platforms must be suitably deep to generate vigorous tidal currents conducive to ooid formation (Hine, 1977; Harris et al., 2019). The first pulse of oolitic production in the Holocene has been dated at ca. 6.8\u202fka BP (Hearty and Kaufman, 2009). These grains are now found in the North Point Member (Carew and Mylroie, 1985; Kindler and Hearty, 1996), an eolianite of middle Holocene age deposited when sea level was between 6 and 7\u202fm below the present datum, and flooding of the Bahamian banks was ca. 50% of what it is presently (Boardman et al., 1989). The absence of ooids in the WPF eolianites thus provides an upper limit for the elevation of the coeval sea level at around 7\u202fm below the modern stand. If sea level had been higher (i.e., between 0 and \u22125\u202fm below present; Hearty and Kaufman, 2000), ooids would have been produced. A lower limit is given by the depth of the platform edge (\u226520\u202fm; Bergman et al., 2010), but as discussed above, the faunal content of the WPF indicates a lagoonal source for the sediments, implying that MIS 5a sea level could not have been that low. Thus, we conclude that sea level was probably between 7 and 11\u202fm below the present datum during the formation of the constituent grains of the WPF. This estimate is consistent with the reconstruction of Toscano and Lundberg (1999) who, based on submerged in-situ corals from the South Florida margin, estimated the peak RSL during MIS 5a at \u22129\u202fm.\nDetermining the elevation of global mean sea level (GMSL) from RSL markers is an increasingly arduous task because the position of the latter depends not only on eustacy and regional tectonics, but also on isostatic uplift due to karstic denudation (Opdyke et al., 1984; Mylroie et al., 2020), glacio-hydro-isostatic processes (i.e., glacial isostatic adjustment, GIA; Dutton and Lambeck, 2012; Dutton et al., 2015, and references therein), and dynamic topography (Dutton et al., 2015; Austermann et al., 2017). Considering the tectonic setting of the Bahamas and the short time span elapsed since the formation of the WPF, most of these factors can be put aside with the exception of GIA. However, recent GIA modelling using a low-viscosity upper mantle in analyzing data on the Pacific coast relative to the Atlantic region, and excluding the Bahamian speleothem (Richards et al., 1994) and eolianite (Hearty and Kaufman, 2000) data from the analysis, constrained peak GMSL at 8.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.6\u202fm below present datum during MIS 5a (Creveling et al., 2017). The RSL elevation obtained from our examination of the WPF (7 to 11\u202fm below present) can thus be considered as a fairly accurate estimate of MIS 5a GMSL. Such an agreement between the elevation of RSL markers in the Bahamas and GIA-modeled sea level was also recognized by Muhs et al. (2020) for the LIG. However, this estimation challenges the opinion of Dorale et al. (2010) who, based on speleothem evidence from Mallorca, reckoned that MIS 5a was at least as ice-free as the present. However, considering that Mallorca is located closer to the position of the former northern hemisphere ice sheets than the Bahamas, it would actually be surprising that the RSL records from both regions would perfectly match.\n\n\n5.6\nSea-level and climate fluctuations in the Bahamas during MIS 5a\nPrevious investigations have demonstrated that both sea level and climate varied significantly and abruptly between 90 and 70\u202fka BP. Using different approaches, Siddall et al. (2003) and Potter et al. (2004) identified two highstands of sea level, separated by a short regression, centered at ca. 84 and ca. 77\u202fka BP, respectively (Fig. 11\n). Furthermore, sudden shifts in the amount of rainfall caused by displacements in the mean annual position of ITCZ have been inferred from the examination of basinal sediments of MIS 5 age from the Caribbean region (Peterson et al., 2000; Gibson and Peterson, 2014; Zhuravleva and Bauch, 2018). These changes have been linked to large millennial-scale temperature oscillations over the North Atlantic (Dansgaard et al., 1993; North Greenland Ice Core Project, 2004; Rasmussen et al., 2014). The facies pattern observed on several WPF exposures can be interpreted as a record of these instabilities in a coastal setting.\nAt many locations (e.g., The Bluff in San Salvador, Fig. 8a; Booby Rocks on the Mayaguana Bank; Port Boyd in Rum Cay), the WPF encompasses two cross-bedded eolian rock bodies separated by one thin, structureless protosol. In other words, the WPF records two phases of eolian deposition, logically following episodes of sediment production, separated by one interval of negative sediment budget and pedogenesis. In the Bahamas, shallow-water carbonate production can only take place when the banks are at least marginally flooded, i.e., when sea level is fairly close to modern datum. Moreover, unlike seaward-prograding eolianites (e.g., Holocene biopelsparite II, Davaud and Strasser, 1984; Hanna Bay Member, Carew and Mylroie, 1985), deposition of advancing dunes essentially occurs during the onset of regressions (Rowe and Bristow, 2015b) and preferentially in dry and windy climatic conditions that prevent dune stabilization by vegetation. Finally, soils mostly form during warm and humid intervals characterized by reduced wind activity that favors the development of vegetation, and limits sand transport.\nBased on these premises, the depositional history of the WPF can be summarized as follows (Fig. 11). The production of the WPF sediments logically began during the first MIS 5a highstand when coralgal reef flourished on the flooded bank margins of the Bahamas. An early phase of dune formation took place when the sea receded from the platforms after this first flooding event. An immature soil then developed on these eolian sands during an interval of non-deposition spanning the ensuing highstand while sediment production resumed on the platform margins. A second pulse of dune building occurred during the late MIS 5a regression. Both episodes of eolian sedimentation must have been short because the dunes did not migrate very far bankwards. The early diagenetic microcrystalline LMC cements observed in the WPF eolianites further indicate that these episodes likely occurred under dry conditions characterized by sparse rainfall followed by intense evapotranspiration (Ward, 1973, 1997).\nDetermining the exact timing of these depositional phases is difficult because the chronologies derived from deep-sea sediments and Greenland ice cores do not fully match (Fig. 11). Based on the sea-level estimates of Siddall et al. (2003), the first phase of eolian deposition could have occurred between ca. 82 and 79\u202fka BP (mid-MIS 5a regression) and the second phase after ca. 77\u202fka BP (onset of the late MIS 5a regression). Relying on ice-core records (Rasmussen et al., 2014), these two phases of dune formation could have happened between ca. 79.8 and 76.4\u202fka BP (cold intervals at the end of Greenland Interstadial 21.1 and Greenland Stadial 21.1) and ca. 74.1 and 72.3\u202fka BP (GS-20), respectively. This age discrepancy could be related to the difference in applied geochronological methods (isotope stratigraphy versus ice-flow model) and\/or to the fact that the structure and timing of millennial-scale variability in some regions appear to have been different from those in the North Atlantic (Rasmussen et al., 2014).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThe Whale Point Formation, formally defined here, is a new addition to the stratigraphic record of the Bahamas islands. It comprises a series of bioclastic eolianites and protosols exposed on high-energy bank margins throughout the Bahamas archipelago. Its stratigraphic position above deposits dated to MIS 5e and below Holocene sediments constrains its age to the latest Pleistocene, most probably to MIS 5a (ca. 80\u202fka BP). This age is further corroborated by AAR data calibrated with UTh ages. Based on their sedimentological characteristics, the WPF eolianites are interpreted as advancing dunes decoupled from their source beaches. Relying on the faunal content, the elevation of RSL during the production of the WPF constituent grains can be assessed at ca. 9\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202fm below the present datum which is consistent with GMSL estimates derived from GIA modelling, suggesting that the Bahamas region might be fairly neutral with respect to surface deformation related to ice-sheet loading.\nThe WPF further comprises two episodes of eolian sedimentation separated by an interval of negative sediment budget and pedogenesis. These facies changes possibly record millennial-scale sea-level and climate instability during MIS 5a, the latter being likely related to shifts in the mean annual position of the ITCZ and associated rainfall belt in response to changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Thus, the coastal record of the WPF appears to confirm the findings of previous studies based on Greenland ice and basinal sediments that suborbital-period climate fluctuations can occur also during times of reduced ice-sheet extent. Such a possibility must be kept in mind in the context of the present-day, human-induced global warming.\n\n","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nConvergent plate margins are among the Earth's longest features with a total length of >55,000\u202fkm (Lallemand, 1999), making the related subduction zone system, the most extensive and pervasive geological structure of our planet. The trench, formed at the downward flexure of the subducting slab, as well as the forearc and trench-slope basins that result from the uplift of accreted materials and upper-plate edge (e.g., Karig and Sharman III, 1975; Seely, 1979; Moore, 1983), receive enormous amount of clastic sediments derived from rapid erosion of the nearby arc massif (Scholl et al., 1970; von Huene, 1974; Scholl, 1974; Dickinson and Seely, 1979; Moore et al., 1982; Underwood et al., 1995; Rea and Ruff, 1996). Due to the relationship between subducting sediments (e.g., sediment types, accumulation rate; von Huene and Scholl, 1991; Clift and Vannucchi, 2004), and the nature of earthquakes along active convergent margins (Ruff, 1989; Rea and Ruff, 1996; Spinelli and Underwood, 2004; Heuret et al., 2012), it is crucial to enhance our understanding about the controlling factors (e.g., tectonic, eustatic, climatic) on the deep-marine sediment dynamics in such settings. Most of the pioneering studies show that, in addition to the obvious tectonic control, the deep-marine stratigraphic patterns along subduction margins (i.e., trenches and forearc basins) are also highly influenced by eustatic and climatic fluctuations such as observed along the Peru\u2013Chile Trench (e.g., Scholl et al., 1970), the Aleutian Trench (e.g., Piper et al., 1973) and the Cascadia margin (i.e., the Cascadia deep-sea channel \u2013 Griggs and Kulm, 1970; the Astoria canyon and fan system \u2013 e.g., Carlson and Nelson, 1969). Some more relatively recent studies focus directly on the last glacial\u2013interglacial fingerprint recorded in the deep-marine environments along the Hikurangi Margin (Carter et al., 2004; Orpin, 2004; Mountjoy et al., 2009; Carter et al., 2010; Gerber et al., 2010; Paquet et al., 2011; Pouderoux et al., 2012; Micallef et al., 2014; Mountjoy et al., 2014; Kuehl et al., 2016), the Chilean Margin (Laursen and Normark, 2003; Blumberg et al., 2008; Bernhardt et al., 2016, 2017) or the Makran Margin (Prins et al., 2000; Stow et al., 2002; Bourget et al., 2010a), strengthening the idea of eustatic and climatic controls on the sediment dynamics of deep-marine environments in convergent settings.\nThe Nankai Margin along the Japanese magmatic arc, is one of the best studied active deep-marine tectono-sedimentary systems worldwide. It has been imaged by numerous 2D and 3D seismic surveys (e.g., Moore et al., 2015) and cored by several deep Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) wells (Tobin et al., 2020; and references therein). Integration of those data sets, with on-land geologic studies has resulted in detailed structural models of the Nankai accretionary wedge and associated Kumano forearc basin (Tobin and Kinoshita, 2006; Strasser et al., 2009; Underwood and Moore, 2012; Moore et al., 2015). Most of the previous research on the Kumano forearc basin has focused on the sediment dynamics related to tectonic activity (Gulick et al., 2010; Ramirez et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2015), sediment routing and deposition based on provenance analysis (Usman et al., 2014; Buchs et al., 2015; Underwood and Guo, 2018; Jaeger et al., 2019; Ramirez et al., 2021), and theoretical aspects explored in numerical models (e.g., Mannu et al., 2017). Because of the resource potential of methane hydrate in the sandy deposits of the Kumano Basin, some researchers also focused on describing the basin-filling stacking patterns and related tectonic influence (Noguchi et al., 2011; Takano et al., 2013). Analyses of glacio-eustatic controls on the deposits of the Kumano Basin and related Nankai Trough area were already undertaken by some researchers. Omura and Ikehara (2010) analyzed the proximal deposits of the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, one of the main canyon-feeder systems of the Kumano Basin. They identified distinct depositional patterns and sediment distribution throughout the last deglaciation, from 14.6\u202fka onwards, i.e., since the later part of the last deglaciation. Additionally, coeval onland exposures of the Nankai forearc basin deposits (Plio\u2013Pleistocene Kazusa Group) record clear evidence of glacio-eustatic cyclicity (Ito and Katsura, 1992; Pickering et al., 1999; Kazaoka et al., 2015). Glacio-eustatic controls on the sedimentary sequence of the Kumano forearc basin have already been mentioned by several authors (Buchs et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2015), yet there is no study that directly focuses on parameters controlling the deep-marine sediment dynamics in this basin.\nOur main objectives are (i) to recognize the types of gravity-flow deposits for each systems tract during the last glacial\u2013interglacial cycle (Late Pleistocene to Holocene) to build a reliable sedimentological model corresponding to a complete stratigraphic sequence and (ii) identify the different extrabasinal and intrabasinal parameters controlling the sediment dynamics of the Kumano Basin during sea-level rise. We focus on a high-resolution shallow seismic dataset that covers the entire basin, from the Taiji to Anoriguchi canyons, thus providing an excellent opportunity to study the morphodynamics of a forearc basin fed by multiple sediment sources during an episode of sea-level rise. By calibrating the depositional model of deep-water sequence stratigraphy in the Kumano Basin, this paper presents the necessary first steps of a large temporal- and spatial-scale sequence stratigraphic study that aims at deconvolving the tectonic, glacio-eustatic and climatic forcings controlling the morphodynamics of the Kumano Basin.\n\n\n2\nRegional setting\nForearc basins are typical features observed between the trench and the magmatic arc at many convergent plate boundaries. The Kumano Basin is a forearc basin located between the Nankai Trough and the Japanese magmatic arc (Fig. 1A). It is located landward of the northern Nankai Trough accretionary prism, formed where the Philippine Sea Plate subducts NW beneath Southern Japan (Amur Plate) at a rate of ~4.1\u20136.5\u202fcm\u202fyr\u22121 (Fig. 1A) (Seno et al., 1993; Miyazaki and Heki, 2001). The basin is ~150\u202fkm long and ~50\u202fkm wide with a maximum water depth up to ~2000\u202fm (Fig. 1B). The Kumano Basin developed during the early Quaternary and is deposited on a Miocene\u2013Pliocene accretionary complex (Underwood and Moore, 2012). The landward margin of the basin is represented by a Cretaceous to Miocene accretionary prism (Shimanto Belt; Taira et al., 1988; Kimura et al., 2014). In the north-eastern area, its seaward margin is the Daini-Atsumi knoll. The forearc outer ridge and the Nankai megasplay fault (an out-of-sequence thrust, Park et al., 2002; Moore et al., 2007) represent the basin's southern margin. The Nankai megasplay fault, initiated ~2\u202fMa, is a landward-dipping fault that splays from the plate interface to the surface, and is the locus of coseismic and tsunamigenic slip (e.g., the 1944 Tonankai earthquake) (Park et al., 2002; Tobin and Kinoshita, 2006; Strasser et al., 2009).\nThe Kumano Basin strata are Quaternary sandy deposits that are mainly derived from the Kii Peninsula and regions to the east on Honshu (Usman et al., 2014; Buchs et al., 2015; Jaeger et al., 2019; Ramirez et al., 2021). Rivers in Japan are usually less than 200\u202fkm long, with drainage areas less than 10,000\u202fkm2, but are defined by a very steep gradient (Ikehara et al., 2020). The main rivers feeding the Kumano Basin are the Kumano, Ibi, Nagara, and Kiso rivers (Fig. 1B). Although small mountainous rivers exist in the Kii Peninsula, the Kumano River is the largest in the area and is the main feeder to the northwest area of the Kumano Basin (Ikehara et al., 2020). The Ibi, Nagara and Kiso rivers mainly feed the Ise Bay (Fig. 1), with some of the clastic inputs reaching the Kumano Basin, funneled by the Anoriguchi Canyon. The submarine canyons, transporting sediments from the inner shelf region to the basin, incise into the upper continental slope but not into the shelf, except for the Anoriguchi, Owase and Taiji canyons (Fig. 1B) (Kawamura et al., 2009; Omura and Ikehara, 2010). Although Buchs et al. (2015) did not find any evidence of contribution from the Tenryu river to the Kumano Basin sediment budget, we cannot exclude the possibility that some sediments are and were supplied from the Tenryu canyon to the Kumano Basin (e.g., fine-grained sediments by overbank flows), especially during early stages of forearc sedimentation.\nDue to their middle-latitude location, the Japanese Islands are affected by the East Asian Monsoon that causes heavy precipitation and major flood events. Several studies show an intensification of the East Asian Monsoon during the last deglaciation (Wang et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2010; Shu et al., 2013). Because of a narrow shelf (<10\u202fkm) alongside the Kii Peninsula, the Kumano Basin has been particularly affected by flood-induced turbidity currents (Shirai et al., 2010; Shirai and Hayashizaki, 2013; Ikehara et al., 2020). Due to the development of the Ise Bay area, the eastern side of the Kumano Basin is characterized by a wide shelf reaching up to ~90\u202fkm. During the Quaternary, sediment transport in the Kumano Basin is mainly related to sediment-gravity flows such as debris flows or turbidity currents. Additionally, there is hemipelagic mud production in the upper water column, leading to continuous fine-grained background sedimentation. Quaternary muds in the Kumano Basin are derived from the Outer Zone of Japan (see Fig. 1B of Jaeger et al., 2019, for location of the Outer Zone) with multiple entry mechanisms and associated transport directions such as (among others): transverse (trench-directed) re-sedimentation by unconfined gravity flows or steady movement of surface-water suspensions by the northeast-directed Kuroshio Current (Underwood and Guo, 2018). Mass-transport deposits, evolving downslope into debris flows and spreading out into the deeper parts of the basin, commonly occur on the forearc outer ridge at the southern edge of the basin (Moore and Strasser, 2016). These mass-transport deposits show transport directions from southeast to northwest and, therefore, are interpreted as resulting from steep landward facing slope failures. These slope failures probably result from seismic shaking that accompanied slip events of the Nankai megasplay fault (Moore et al., 2015).\nGlacio-eustatic sea level variation, and particularly the effect of the last deglaciation, has been studied based on sedimentary analysis in the coastal depositional environment of Japan (Umitsu, 1992; Saito, 1994; Masuda and Iwabuchi, 2003; Omura and Ikehara, 2010; Hori et al., 2011; Saegusa et al., 2011; Omura et al., 2012; Tanigawa et al., 2013; Sugai et al., 2016). However, only a few of these studies focus on the SW Japan coastal environment and particularly in the Ise Bay area. Based on analysis of cores drilled in the Nobi Plain, Umitsu (1992) investigated coastal environmental changes around the Ise Bay that were associated with the relative sea-level rise during the Last Glacial Maximum and the following deglaciation period. Masuda and Iwabuchi (2003) investigated the delta progradation of the Kiso River in the Ise Bay during the last transgression stage. Omura and Ikehara (2010) and Omura et al. (2012) were among the first to recognize the fingerprint of the last deglaciation within the deep-marine sedimentation of the Kumano Basin, using several sediment cores, although they mainly focused on the deposits of the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth. Covering a larger time-scale, Buchs et al. (2015) identified the presence of mud-sand cycles occurring in the upper part of the upper-forearc basin using gamma ray data at IODP Site C0009, showing an average recurrence of ~40\u202fkyr. Moore et al. (2015) proposed that the presence of meso-scale cycles in the sediments of the Kumano Basin may be caused by eustatic sea-level fluctuations, with higher influx of sand during lowstands. Despite the amount of research in coastal environments and some hypotheses about eustatic-related cycles in the deep Kumano Basin, no study focuses directly on the glacio-eustatic control on the sediment supply and distribution in the deep-marine environments of the Kumano Basin.\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nTerminology\nThe development of sequence stratigraphy over the last 50\u202fyears without supervision from any international stratigraphic scientific community has led to a mismatch and confusion in the use of terminology (Catuneanu, 2017). Here, we aim to clarify the terminology of deep-marine sequence stratigraphy that is used for this study. Because there are no temporal or physical standards for the scale of stratigraphic sequences we define an individual stratigraphic sequence as including three systems tracts, from base to top: the lowstand, transgressive and the highstand systems tracts. The lowstand systems tract, located at the base of a stratigraphic sequence, is delimited by the basal surface of forced regression at its base and the maximum regressive surface at its top. It includes the deposits of the regression (i.e., falling stage systems tract) as well as the lowstand systems tract when the sea-level is at its minimum (in our study period: Last Glacial Maximum). The basal surface forced regression is usually recognized by an increase in siliciclastic sediment supply. In contrast, the maximum regressive surface usually correlates with the end of chaotic and disturbed deposits when the shelf becomes completely exposed (Flood and Piper, 1997; Piper et al., 1997; Catuneanu, 2020). The lowstand systems tract generally shows the highest sediment supply (Piper et al., 1997). The transgressive systems tract marks the rise in sea-level and is bounded by the maximum regression surface and the maximum flooding surface. Finally, the highstand systems tract, showing the lowest sediment supply (Catuneanu, 2020, and references therein), is delimited by the maximum flooding surface at its base and by the basal surface of forced regression at the top.\nThe types of deposits interpreted in our study are related to cohesive-flow (e.g., debris- and mud-flows deposits; see Pickering and Hiscott, 2016, for definition), turbulent-flow (e.g., high- and low-density turbidites), mass-transports (e.g., slump, submarine landslide), and hemipelagic fallout (e.g., hemipelagic muds). To observe the lateral facies variation, deposits are described from proximal to distal direction (paleo-flow direction). The proximal to distal areas are inferred from the sediment entry points (such as canyon mouths) described in published papers (Arita and Kinoshita, 1988; Omura and Ikehara, 2010; Omura et al., 2012; Usman et al., 2014; Buchs et al., 2015; Jaeger et al., 2019; Ikehara et al., 2020) as well as by the slope of the seismic profile.\n\n\n3.2\nSubbottom profiler data\nOur sequence stratigraphic study is based on the analysis of the subbottom profiler data acquired during the R\/V Sonne SO-222 (Kopf et al., 2012) and SO251-2 cruises (Strasser et al., 2017) in 2012 and 2016. For both cruises, the R\/V Sonne was equipped with an ATLAS Parasound P70 echosounder, emitting two high frequencies of 18\u202fkHz and 22\u202fkHz; non-linear interference of the high frequencies produces a secondary frequency of about 4\u202fkHz which is used for making the seismic profiles. The acquired subbottom profiles, thus, have a theoretical vertical resolution of ~10\u201320\u202fcm. Although the analysis of subbottom profiler data provides the opportunity to describe a depositional model at a very-high depth resolution (i.e., at the bed scale), the seismic penetration depth is limited (see Section 3.3).\n\n\n3.3\nSubbottom profiler data interpretation\nWe mapped key horizons bounding the systems tracts and the different seismic facies using the standard seismic stratigraphic mapping tools implemented in the Kingdom Suite 2018 (IHS market, Ltd) and follow standard seismostratigraphic interpretation techniques based on reflection terminations, reflection configurations and geometry of facies units (e.g., Bourget et al., 2010b). The seismic basement depth (i.e., the deepest visualized reflector) depends on the seismic penetration depth and varies for different areas of the basin as a function of spatial lithological differences in attenuating the acoustic signal. Therefore, the mapped seismic basement is not a true stratigraphic horizon, yet it is arbitrarily defined as the base of the oldest unit in the deep basin where the subbottom profiler data resolves the deepest subsurface of the entire data set. Seismic profiles without interpretation are available in Supplementary Material 1.\nTo illustrate the geomorphological evolution of the basin throughout the last deglaciation, paleotopographic maps of each picked horizon (sub-unit boundaries) on the subbottom profiler dataset are computed after a time\u2013depth conversion using a velocity of 1500\u202fm\u202fs\u22121. Each grid surface is created based on the horizon (in depth) using the algorithm Flex Gridding in Kingdom Suite 2018, with a grid cell size of 100\u202fm. Grids are later exported in Global Mapper 13 in which contour lines are computed. Isopach maps are calculated by subtracting the depth of the horizon bounding the top of a unit from the depth of the horizon representing its base. Sand vs mud distribution in the basin is considered based on the analysis of mean-envelope maps. Mean-envelope maps give the mean envelope between two horizons, i.e., the average degree of reflectivity in the considered seismic unit. Mean-envelope maps are computed using the Volume Attribute vatmeane function in Kingdom Suite 2018. Mean-envelope grids are calculated using the same parameters as for the isopach maps.\n\n\n3.4\nCore data\nAges of the interpreted sequence stratigraphic horizons as interpreted in subbottom profiler data were constrained by core-to-seismic correlation and age constraints from gravity and piston cores from Omura and Ikehara (2010). Three cores recovered adjacent to subbottom profiler seismic lines were selected for this purpose: piston cores 02DMKUPC03, 02DMKUPC08 and gravity core GH97-307, acquired with the research vessels R\/V Hakurei-maru and R\/V Hakurei-maru No. 2 in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth during cruises GH97 (April\u2013May 1997) and 02DM (December 2002\u2013January 2003). Depositional ages were determined by 14C analyses of foraminifera and organic carbon and by correlation with tephra layers of known ages published by Omura and Ikehara (2010). In our study we recalibrate the 14C ages previously calculated by Omura and Ikehara (2010). Our calibrations are made with Calib Radiocarbon Calibration (version 8.1.0) using the latest marine curve \u201cMarine 20\u201d (Heaton et al., 2020) and with the local marine reservoir effect compensated by using a \u0394R value of 82\u202f\u00b1\u202f33\u202fyears. To be consistent, we also calibrate 14C ages collected in the proximal environment of the Kumano deep-marine system (i.e., the Ise Bay) from the studies of Umitsu (1992), Toyokura et al. (1999) and Masuda and Iwabuchi (2003). Radiocarbon age calibration data is available in Supplementary Material 2. Lithological description of gravity and piston core data of Omura and Ikehara (2010), Arita and Kinoshita (1988) and Ikehara (1999) are used to provide ground truth for interpretations of seismic facies related to the youngest seismic unit.\n\n\n\n4\nSequence stratigraphy during the last deglaciation deposits\n\n4.1\nSeismic units and facies\nBecause of the high degree of lateral change in facies and seismic penetration depth, we divided the Kumano Basin into three distinct study areas designated as: the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, the deep basin and the northwestern platform (Fig. 1B).\nThree major acoustic facies are distinguished in the Upper Pleistocene\/Holocene deposits, allowing division of the subbottom profiler dataset into three different depositional units from unit 3 (the oldest) to unit 1 (the youngest). Each unit is bounded by a horizon (i.e., bounding surface) marking clear changes in the succession, interpreted as transitional steps in the sequence stratigraphic succession.\n\n4.1.1\nUnit 3\nUnit 3 is the deepest and the thickest unit observed in the high-resolution subbottom profiler dataset. Deposits of unit 3 are characterized by variable amplitude and variable continuity reflections. It consists of an alternation of chaotic low-amplitude reflections (dominant) with subparallel irregular high-amplitude reflections (secondary) (Fig. 2\n). This observation reveals the dominance of chaotic deposits interpreted as cohesive-flow deposits such as debris- and mud-flow deposits. In minor proportion, high- and low-density turbidites are also present as well as mass-transports deposits in the top of the unit. Unit 3 is divided in two sub-units, i.e., unit 3b (its base, constraint by the seismic penetration depth in the deep basin (see methodological explanation in Section 3.3), is defined by the dashed red horizon in Fig. 2) and unit 3a (its base is defined by the yellow horizon in Fig. 2). The top of the unit is defined by the first continuous high-amplitude horizon (green horizon in Fig. 2).\n\n4.1.1.1\nDescription\nUnit 3b is generally characterized by chaotic to subparallel alternating low-to moderate amplitude reflections. Although unit 3b is dominated by low-amplitude discontinuous chaotic reflections in the central part of the deep basin (Fig. 2, cross-section AB), the western part of the deep-basin area is characterized by intercalated subparallel low-and high-amplitude reflections (Fig. 2, cross-section CD). There is a progressive transition from chaotic to subparallel reflection from the deep basin to basin edge. In the northwestern area, a significant change in the sediment organization is noted compared to the other areas of the Kumano Basin. There, unit 3b shows relatively parallel semi-continuous, low-amplitude reflections with some intermittent, semi-continuous high-amplitude reflections (Fig. 2, cross-section EF). In the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth area, unfortunately, unit 3b is not resolved because of limited seismic penetration (Fig. 2, cross-section GH).\nUnit 3a is mostly characterized by intercalated chaotic to subparallel semi-continuous high- and low-amplitude reflections (Fig. 2, e.g. cross-section CD). From the base of unit 3b to the top of unit 3a, there is a progressive grading from low- to high-amplitude reflections as well as from chaotic and discontinuous to relatively parallel and continuous reflections. Wedge-shaped low-amplitude chaotic structures topped up by semi-continuous high-amplitude reflections are observed in the central area of the deep basin (Fig. 2, cross-section AB). From proximal to distal areas, there is an increase in the reflection stratification (Fig. 2, cross-section CD). In the northwestern platform, compared to unit 3b, unit 3a is dominated by continuous, parallel, high-amplitude reflections intercalated with semi-continuous, low-amplitude reflections. In the Anoriguchi canyon mouth, the lowermost part of unit 3a is not resolved because of limited seismic penetration. In the proximal part of the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, the upper part of unit 3a consists of chaotic low-amplitude and low-lateral continuity reflections alternate with chaotic high-amplitude and low continuity reflections (Fig. 2, cross-section GH). In the distal part of the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, e.g., at the transition to the deep-basin area, cut-and-fill structures with low- to high-amplitude internal reflections indicate erosion of subparallel and semi-continuous high-amplitude horizons (Fig. 2, cross-section GH).\n\n\n4.1.1.2\nInterpretation\nIntercalated chaotic low-amplitude and subparallel high-amplitude reflections are interpreted as cohesive-flow deposits (i.e., debris-flow and mud-flow deposits; see Pickering and Hiscott, 2016, for terminology) and as turbulent flow deposits (sandy turbidites), respectively. Regarding turbidite interpretation, a similar acoustic character (i.e., subparallel high-amplitude reflections) was interpreted as sandy layers and confirmed by coring data in the Japan Trench (Kioka et al., 2019; based on data using the same research vessel \u2013 R\/V Sonne \u2013 with the same data acquisition process). Wedge-shape chaotic structures imaged in the central deep basin (Fig. 2, cross-section AB) are interpreted as mass-transport deposits (i.e., submarine-slide related). Dominant deposits within unit 3 are related to debris- and mud-flow deposits and turbidites. Mass-transport deposits are only present in the central deep basin and represent a minor proportion of unit 3. Cut-and-fill structures at the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth are interpreted as paleo-canyons\/channels (Fig. 2, cross-section GH). The different seismic facies, such as debris-flow deposits, channel incisions and mass-transport deposits in unit 3, imply that the sediments were deposited in a high-energy environment. Because mass-transport deposits are located in the deep basin (Fig. 2; cross-section AB) away from the hinterland source sediments, one possibility would be that some mass-transport deposits result from slope failures, along the steep seaward (southern) edge of the Kumano Basin rather than from a hinterland source (Moore and Strasser, 2016). The presence of paleo-canyons\/channels at the transition from the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth to deep-basin areas, could indicate a paleo break-of-slope environment where high-energetic sediment-gravity flows were undergoing hydraulic jumps and producing a high-degree of erosion and deposition of the bedload (Wynn et al., 2002; Dorrell et al., 2016). The transition from low-amplitude chaotic reflections, mostly interpreted as cohesive-flow deposits in Anoriguchi and Taiji Canyon mouths, to the dominance of high-amplitude relatively well-stratified reflections interpreted as turbidites in the deep basin, could also be related to such slope breaks (Weirich, 1988; Russel and Arnott, 2003).\n\n\n\n4.1.2\nUnit 2\nUnit 3 is conformably overlain by unit 2. Unit 2 is mainly characterized by semi-continuous to continuous parallel high-amplitude reflection intercalated with some intermittent chaotic to parallel low-amplitude reflections (Fig. 3\n). In terms of interpreted deposits, turbulent-flow deposits such as sandy turbidites are dominant. Cohesive-flow deposits (debris- and mud-flow deposits, mostly located in the proximal area of the basin) and undisturbed muddy deposits (i.e., hemipelagic muds) are present in minor proportion and are intercalated between the sandy turbidites. Because of distinct seismic facies, and particularly in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, unit 2 is divided into two sub-units, i.e., unit 2a and unit 2b (Fig. 3), with unit 2b showing a higher content of chaotic reflections than unit 2a mainly characterized by well-stratified reflections.\n\n4.1.2.1\nDescription\nThe base of unit 2 consists of the first occurrence of a continuous, high-amplitude reflection (green horizon in Fig. 3) and the top is related to the last continuous high-amplitude reflection (blue horizon in Fig. 3).\nBecause the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth shows good preservation and seismic penetration, boundaries of unit 2 as well as subunits were first defined in this area. Also, it is this area of the basin where the transition from unit 3 to unit 2 is defined best (Fig. 3, cross-section AB). Indeed, this limit shows an abrupt transition from low-amplitude chaotic reflections to high-amplitude and continuous reflections (Fig. 3, cross-section AB). Unit 2b shows a progressive decrease from low-amplitude chaotic discontinuous to high-amplitude continuous parallel reflections in a proximal-to-distal direction. However, unit 2a has continuous and parallel reflections with a relative decrease in high-amplitude reflections from proximal to distal areas.\nUnit 2b and unit 2a in the deep basin area are characterized by sheet-like, continuous, and parallel, alternating low- to transparent and high-amplitude reflections with a dominance of the latter (Fig. 3, cross-section CD). Unit 2b as well as unit 2a in the Taiji Canyon mouth are characterized by semi-continuous to continuous low- to high-amplitude reflections (Fig. 3, cross-section EF). In the northwestern platform, unit 2b is relatively thin compared to unit 2a. However, both subunits show similar seismic facies that consist of continuous and parallel, alternating low- to high-amplitude reflections. Because some of deposits are ponded in basins, they occur as pinch-out lenses. Some intermittent, relatively thick, chaotic to semi-continuous low-amplitude reflections are also observed in unit 2a (Fig. 3, cross-section GH).\n\n\n4.1.2.2\nInterpretation\nBecause of the strong density contrast and resulting high acoustic impedance, continuous well-stratified, high-amplitude reflections are interpreted as sandy turbidites. The alternating continuous low-amplitude reflections are due to a pause in the terrigenous clastic input and define deposition of hemipelagic materials, settled from the upper water column, draping the underlying structures. This agrees with the observation of Omura and Ikehara (2010), who described a high proportion of turbidites alternating with hemipelagic muds in the respective stratigraphic depth cored in the Anoriguchi canyon mouth area.\nUnit 2b is marked by low-amplitude chaotic deposits in the proximal part of the basin (Anoriguchi Canyon mouth). These deposits are interpreted as cohesive-flow deposits that could be related to debris-flow or mud-flow deposits. Distal deposits of unit 2b consist of well-stratified, high-amplitude reflections interpreted as turbidites.\nCompared to unit 2b, unit 2a is characterized by a higher proportion of low-amplitude reflections interpreted as hemipelagic materials and a decrease in the content of debris-flow deposits in the distal areas of the basin. Few debris-flow deposits are observed in the northwestern platform and in the Taiji Canyon mouth (Fig. 3, cross-section EF). Similarly, there is a surprisingly low proportion of chaotic deposits in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth.\n\n\n\n4.1.3\nUnit 1\nUnit 1 overlies unit 2. Overall, unit 1 is mainly characterized by weak parallel and continuous low-amplitude reflections throughout the basin, while only toward the proximal areas of the basin, reflection amplitudes increase (Fig. 4\n) (i.e., at the canyon mouths and in the northwestern platform area). In terms of interpreted deposits, unit 1 is mainly composed of undisturbed muddy deposits interpreted as hemipelagic muds. In the proximal area of the basin, there is a significant increase in turbulent-flow deposits, i.e., sandy turbidites.\n\n4.1.3.1\nDescription\nThe Anoriguchi Canyon mouth is characterized by stacked sheet-like, parallel, low- to moderate-amplitude reflections with some scattered lens-shaped deposits occurring in the highly-confined Anoriguchi Canyon mouth (Fig. 4, cross-section AB). Sediments are mostly confined between sediment waves located on the eastern (Omura and Ikehara, 2010) and western edges of the basin. The high-amplitude reflections decrease in a proximal\u2013distal direction.\nBecause it is easier to distinguish the last occurrence of high-amplitude reflections in the deep basin, the top of unit 2 (base of unit 1) was first defined in the deep-basin area (Fig. 4, cross-section CD). In the deep basin, unit 1 is mainly represented by continuous, parallel, reflection free layer. A single continuous high-amplitude reflection is present throughout the deep basin, located approximately in the middle of unit 1 (Fig. 4, cross-section CD). In the proximal area of the deep basin, such as near the Taiji Canyon Mouth, there is a high content of parallel high-amplitude reflections, however, the amount decreases in a proximal\u2013distal direction (Fig. 4, cross-section EF).\nOn the northwestern platform, continuous and parallel, high-amplitude, lens-shaped reflections are dominant, with some intercalated continuous and parallel, low-amplitude reflections (Fig. 4, cross-section GH). There is a decrease in the number of high-amplitude reflections from proximal to distal areas.\n\n\n4.1.3.2\nInterpretation\nUnit 1 is interpreted to have been deposited by fall-out of fine-grained suspended sediment during a period of weak terrigenous sandy clastic input. The continuous high-amplitude reflections, well displayed in the deep-basin area (Fig. 4, cross-section CD), are related to a tephra layer, commonly known as the Kikai-Akahoya Tephra (K-Ah; ~7325\u202fyr BP; Arita and Kinoshita, 1988; Fukusawa, 1995; Omura and Ikehara, 2010) (Fig. 5\n). As observed by Arita and Kinoshita (1988), the K-Ah tephra layer is mostly present throughout the whole basin. However, because of the high siliciclastic sediment supply in the proximal area of the basin, it is not possible to distinguish the tephra layer from sandy turbidites on subbottom profiler data.\nAlthough the system at the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth is dominated by hemipelagic mud, there has been significant coarse-grained terrigenous sediment input coming from the Ise Bay.\nDeposits of unit 1 in the northwestern platform, as well as those at the Taiji Canyon mouth, contain sandier turbidites in the basin, compared to those deposited at the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth. The high content of sandy layers in the northwestern platform was also recognized by Arita and Kinoshita (1988) and Ikehara (1999) from gravity core observations.\n\nOmura and Ikehara (2010) provide age dating based on radiocarbon analysis of gravity cores sampled in the Anoriguchi canyon mouth. Based on their geographical locations, data from three cores (02DMKUPC03, 02DMKUPC08 and GH97-307) are integrated and correlated with the interpreted Parasound subbottom profiler lines (Fig. 5). Core\/seismic correlation is based on the K-Ah ash layer, first dated by Fukusawa (1995) at ~7325\u202fyr BP. Only one core (core 02DMKUPC03) located in the distal area of the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, penetrated deep enough to reach the base of unit 1. According to radiocarbon dating from Omura and Ikehara (2010), the base of unit 1 would be estimated at 10,394\u202fcal\u202fyr BP.\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nSediment distribution\n\nFig. 6\n shows maps of paleotopography, isopach and the mean envelope for each unit over the entire Kumano Basin. As explained above (see Section 4.1.1), because of limited seismic penetration in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, the base of unit 3 is not resolved in this area (Fig. 2, cross-section GH). However, the seismic acoustic basement in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth is relatively closed in depth from the base of unit 3a (c.f., blue and yellow horizons, respectively, in Fig. 2, cross-section GF). Thus, to study the morphological variation of unit 3a in the whole basin (i.e., from the Anoriguchi canyon mouth to the northwestern platform), we picked the seismic acoustic basement in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, located ~1.5 to 2\u202fm above the stratigraphic horizon defining the base of unit 3a (yellow horizon in Fig. 2), and expanded this chronostratigraphic horizon (dashed blue horizon in Fig. 2) to the whole basin. We use this methodological horizon to calculate the maps of paleotopography, isopach and the mean envelope for unit 3a. Although it is important to keep in mind that a very-thin layer (<2\u202fm) located at the bottom of the described unit 3a is not considered in our calculation, this does not influence the interpretation of our results.\nUnit 3b is the thickest unit, with thickness up to ~28\u202fm in the deep basin and in the northwestern platform. Because of the presence of two depocenters in unit 3b, i.e., in the deep basin and in the northwestern platform, we infer that the deep basin was mainly fed by the Anoriguchi Canyon to the East and by the Taiji Canyon to the West, whereas the northwestern platform was mainly fed by the network of smaller canyons located in the basin's northwestern area. In unit 3b, the mean envelope, indicating the degree of reflectivity, is very low throughout the basin. This is due to the high content of chaotic, very low-amplitude reflections that characterize cohesive-flow deposits, but also because the data reach the limits of seismic penetration. There is a significant decrease in thickness between unit 3b and unit 3a, with the main depocenter of unit 3a located in the northwestern platform and within the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth, with a maximum thickness up to ~18\u202fm (Fig. 6). There is an increase in the mean envelope observed in unit 3a compared to unit 3b, probably linked with the increase in well-stratified sandy deposits observed toward the top of unit 3a. We note that there is a negative correlation between the mean envelope and the deposit thickness, with the highest mean-envelope value occurring on the edge of the basin where deposits are thinner. However, this observation should be interpreted cautiously, because the degree of reflectivity also depends on how much seismic energy is reflected and absorbed by the overlying layer, which is less for the generally thinner deposits on the edge of the basin. There is an abrupt transition in the mean envelope between the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth region, which has a relatively low mean envelope with the deep basin showing a relatively high mean envelope. As described above, this is probably linked with the lateral variation of facies between low-reflection chaotic deposits interpreted as cohesive-flow deposits to well-stratified high-amplitude turbidites to the distal areas, where a paleo break-of-slope could induce a change in flow dynamics (hydraulic jump, flow transformation; see Section 4.1.1).\nCompared to unit 3, unit 2 decreases significantly in thickness, but the mean envelope increases (Fig. 6). Sediments of unit 2b mainly accumulated in the proximal area of the basin, implying that mainly the Anoriguchi and the Taiji canyons were active at this time. The maximum thickness of unit 2b is up to 9\u202fm thick at the Taiji and Anoriguchi Canyon mouths. However, high mean-envelope values occur in the deep basin, indicating that sheet-like sandy deposits are mostly located in the deeper part of the basin. This is also shown in Fig. 3, and particularly in cross-section AB, which illustrates a transition from chaotic low-reflection amplitude deposits to well-organized high-reflection turbidites for the deposits of unit 2b. This leads to the conclusion that during the deposition of unit 2b, most of the turbidites accumulated in the deep basin whereas chaotic deposits such as debris-flow deposits accumulated in the proximal part of the basin.\nRegarding unit 2a, there was a change in the location of the depocenter from the Anoriguchi and Taiji Canyon mouths to the northwestern platform (Fig. 6). Unit 2a displays thickness up to ~16\u202fm in the northern platform. There is also a change in the location of the highest mean-envelope value from the deep basin for unit 2b to the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth for unit 2a. This is also observed in cross-section AB (Fig. 3), which shows a high content of stacked sandy turbidites in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth.\nThe sediment distributions of units 1 and 2a are similar, with the main depocenter located in the northwestern platform (Fig. 6). Unit 1 increases in thickness within the Anoriguchi Canyon, where it reaches ~9\u202fm. Because unit 1 is mainly composed of hemipelagic mud, there is a decrease in the mean envelope value between the deposits of unit 2b and the ones of unit 1. However, the mean envelope is relatively higher (and similar to unit 2) in the proximal areas such as in the northwestern platform as well as at the Taiji and Anoriguchi canyon mouths compared with the distal area of the basin, indicating that some sand input reaches the proximal basin.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThe last deglaciation fingerprint in the deep-marine Kumano Basin\nGlobal changes in sea-level and ice volumes observed from the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent deglaciation have been intensely studied for many decades (Clark and Mix, 2002; Lambeck et al., 2002; Stanford et al., 2011 ; Carlson and Clark, 2012 and references therein). During the Last Glacial Maximum, the sea level was ~120\u2013130\u202fm lower than today. It is important to note that most of the studies give an estimated age for the different stages of sea-level rise that are based on the coastal environments. The most up-to-date compilations indicate that the timing of deglaciation and related onset of sea-level rise is estimated between ~21\u202fka and ~19\u202fka (Clark and Mix, 2002; Lambeck et al., 2002; Carlson and Clark, 2012). Slow and continued sea-level rise started at ~19\u202fka (Clark and Mix, 2002; Lambeck et al., 2002; Carlson and Clark, 2012). A worldwide pulse in the rate of sea-level rise, related to the increase in meltwater in the oceans is estimated to have started between ~16\u202fka and ~14.5\u202fka and ended between ~12.5\u202fka and ~11\u202fka (Lambeck et al., 2002; Carlson and Clark, 2012). The end of the major global sea level rise is estimated between ~8\u202fka and ~7\u202fka (Clark and Mix, 2002; Lambeck et al., 2002; Carlson and Clark, 2012). However, it is important to consider the spatial variability of the documented sea-level rise evolution during the last deglaciation. This is mainly caused by contrasting crustal rebound depending on earth crustal rheology and ice-load history (including the glaciation height and ice-sheet extent) in response to ice melting (Lambeck et al., 2002). This induces temporal changes in the dating of the onset and end of the last deglaciation as well as differently-timed pulses of sea-level rise (e.g., in the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea, Chappell and Polach, 1991; Sunda shelf, SE Asia, Hanebuth et al., 2009; Bonaparte Gulf, northwestern Australia, Ishiwa et al., 2016; Great Barrier Reef, northeastern Australia, Yokoyama et al., 2018).\nRegarding the coastal environment of the Kumano Basin, several age models were proposed by analyzing stratigraphic fingerprints of the last deglaciation in the Ise Bay, one of the main potential sediment sources of the Kumano Basin (through the Anoriguchi Canyon). Based on the analysis of samples from the Kiso river delta (southern part of the Nobi plain), Umitsu (1992) estimated that the first fingerprints of transgression (marine environment) in the Ise Bay are recorded between 10,866\u202fcal\u202fyr BP (~11\u202fka) and 8904\u202fcal\u202fyr BP, as suggested by the presence of an oyster sample dated at 9990\u202fcal\u202fyr BP, giving a paleo-water depth of ~30\u202fm. This is in agreement with (1) the transgressive unit described in the Ise Bay by Toyokura et al. (1999), dated at 10,052\u202fcal\u202fyr BP; (2) the oldest marine sample described by Ogami et al. (2009) in the Ise Bay (core KZ1), dated between 9,114 and 9,468\u202fcal\u202fyr BP; and (3) diatom analysis showing the marine environment in the Ise Bay between ~10,5\u202fcal\u202fka BP and ~9\u202fcal\u202fka BP, depending on the coring site location (Saegusa et al., 2011). Thus, in our study, we consider that the Ise Bay was under marine conditions from ~10\u202fcal\u202fka BP. The progradation of the delta marking the beginning of the highstand tract is estimated to have started ~5,7\u202fcal\u202fka BP (Umitsu, 1992). However, Saegusa et al. (2011) inferred the start of delta progradation at ~7,3\u202fka, which is in relative agreement with Ogami et al. (2009) who identified the maximum transgression at between ~7,3 and 7,8\u202fcal\u202fka BP. Masuda and Iwabuchi (2003) place this before 6,229\u202fcal\u202fyr BP. Although the exact timing of the start of delta progradation is variable among the river systems depending on sediment supply, similar changes in systems tracts from transgressive to highstand systems tracts have been documented along many river systems in Japan (e.g., Kumozu River at the western side of the Ise Bay, Funabiki et al., 2010; Yahagi river at the north of the Mikawa Bay connected to the Ise Bay, Sato and Masuda, 2010). The timing of the onset of delta progradation is also dependent on the coring site location. Thus, we estimate the onset of delta progradation (i.e., beginning of highstand systems tract) between ~7,8 and ~5,7\u202fcal\u202fka BP. It is important to consider the apparent discrepancy between global datasets reconstructing the onset of eustatic sea-level rise at ~19\u202fka and the local inferences from coastal datasets on the relative sea-level rise with the transgression at ~10\u202fcal\u202fka BP when the Ise Bay can be considered as a marine environment. This can be explained by the fact that the Ise Bay was still partially emerged until ~10\u202fcal\u202fka BP. From ~10\u202fcal\u202fka BP, the first effects of transgression related to the flooding of the bay are recorded (Stage 3, Fig. 7\n). As described above, from the core\/seismic integration based on the core data of Omura and Ikehara (2010), the base of unit 1 is dated at 10,394\u202fcal\u202fyr BP. Therefore, we infer that the sediments of unit 1 correspond to the time of the development of the Ise Bay (Stage 3, Fig. 7) as well as the highstand systems tract starting at between ~7,8 and ~5,7\u202fcal\u202fka BP (Stage 4, Fig. 7). Sediments of units 2 and 3 (below unit 1) were deposited during the stage of global sea-level rise starting at ~19\u202fka (Stage 2, Fig. 7) and during the Last Glacial Maximum (Stage 1, Fig. 7). Because there is no core that reaches deeper into unit 2 or unit 3, there is no age constraint to date the respective deposits. Thus, in order to delimitate the deposits related to sea-level rise from those of the Last Glacial Maximum, we mainly based our interpretation on the seismic facies analysis and possible climatic control during deglaciation.\n\n5.1.1\nStage 1 \u2013 lowstand systems tract (including the Last Glacial Maximum at ~21\u202fka)\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, corresponding to the lowstand systems tract, the shoreline line was located near the shelf edge, estimated at ~130\u202fm below its current level (Fig. 1) (Nakada et al., 1991), implying that rivers were directly connected to the heads of submarine canyons (Figs. 7 and 8\n). During this cold and dry period (Nakagawa et al., 2003), the Ise Bay was emerged and can be described as a fluvial environment (Stage 1, Fig. 7) (Masuda and Iwabuchi, 2003; Ogami et al., 2009). The lowstand systems tract in deep-marine systems is commonly characterized by (i) chaotic deposits such as debris-flows or mudflows as well as turbidites (Posamentier and Kolla, 2003; Catuneanu, 2020 and references therein) and (ii) high sediment accumulation rates, all suggesting that high-volume, coarse-grained materials bypassed the submarine canyons and channels to be deposited on the deeper basin seafloor (Vail, 1991; Gorini et al., 2015; Catuneanu, 2020). From these statements, we suspect that deposits of unit 3, mainly composed of cohesive-flow deposits and turbidites (Fig. 2) and showing the thickest accumulation (Fig. 6) in the deepest Kumano Basin, can be related to a lowstand systems tract. Chaotic deposits within the Kumano Basin strata can be the result of high-energy flows that bypassed the canyon\/channel network and were deposited directly in the basin (Figs. 7 and 8). Because we lack age control, we cannot rule out that the accumulation of cohesive-flow deposits of unit 3b in the Kumano Basin corresponds to a falling-stage systems tract (before reaching the Last Glacial Maximum), a period that usually shows the highest sediment supply during the forced regression. Furthermore, there is a decrease in the proportion of chaotic deposits, interpreted as cohesive-flow deposits, as well as an increase in sandy turbidites in unit 3a compared to unit 3b. This could indicate that the sea-level reached its lowest level (i.e., Last Glacial Maximum), which is usually associated with a decrease in the supply of chaotic deposits induced by the capacity of the shelf to retain river supply (Catuneanu, 2020, and references therein), with only more dilute flows reaching the deep basin.\n\n\n5.1.2\nStage 2 \u2013 onset of the global eustatic sea-level rise and initial Ise-Bay transgression (~19\u202fka to 10\u202fka)\nThe start of the transgressive systems tract, commonly referred to as the Jomon Transgression or Yurakucho Transgression in Japan (Kaizuka, 1980), marks the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, the increase of global temperature and the onset of the subsequent deglaciation period and related processes. Regarding the Kumano-Basin case, we suspect that between ~19\u202fka and 10\u202fka, the canyon head was flooded, cutting the direct connections between the river and the canyon head, (Stage 2, Fig. 7). Initial transgression led to the partial flooding of the Ise Bay in the eastern area of the basin. As a consequence of the flooding and related direct disconnection between the river and deep-marine system, some of the sediments, particularly the sediment-gravity flow bedload, were trapped in the alluvial and coastal-plain environments, therefore, not all the sediment-gravity flows and only the more diluted flows reached the basin floor. From these criteria, the onset of the deglaciation should be recorded as a decrease in chaotic deposits and related high-energetic sediment-gravity flows and an increase in relatively low-energetic (dilute) sandy sediment-gravity flows such as turbidity currents. Changes in the type of sediment-gravity flows are observed in the top of unit 3 as well as the base of unit 2. In a proximal to distal direction, we suspect a decrease in flow intensity compared to the older deposits of unit 3, with cohesive-flow deposits mostly located to the proximal area and the distal area (deep basin) characterized by turbidites (Fig. 8), e.g., the Anoriguchi canyon mouth (Fig. 3 \u2013 cross-section AB) but also for the Taiji canyon mouth (Fig. 3 \u2013 cross-section EF) in the western area of the basin. We thus interpret a flow transformation from cohesive to turbulent flow while flows moved downslope. Flow transformation is triggered by deposition of the bedload and seawater incorporation, leading to a decrease in sediment concentration, matrix strength and in flow velocity (e.g., Pickering and Hiscott, 2016; Cornard and Pickering, 2019 and references therein). Furthermore, we note a significant increase in terrigenous sand-rich proportion in unit 2 compared to unit 3 (Fig. 6).\nRegarding the northwestern platform, because of narrower width, the shelf was most likely flooded quicker than the Ise Bay. Yet, the close proximity between the Kumano-river head and Shingu-canyon head (<5\u202fkm) likely permitted the sediment-gravity flows to reach the deep-marine environment of the Kumano Basin, explaining the relatively sustained sediment supply observed from the top of unit 3 and throughout unit 2 (see Section 5.2 for further discussion).\nAlthough we attribute the increase of sandy materials at the top of unit 3 to deposition during the Last Glacial Maximum, another hypothesis could be that the onset of the deglaciation is recorded in the deep-marine deposits of the Kumano Basin toward the top of unit 3a and the base of unit 2. Indeed, the presence of mass-transport deposits in the deep-basin at the top of unit 3, already linked to high seismicity observed in the Nankai subduction zone by several studies (e.g., Ikari et al., 2011; Strasser et al., 2011), could also be due to the onset of sea-level rise. In the last decade, the effect of sea-level rise on landslide occurrence has been intensely discussed (Urlaub et al., 2013; Pope et al., 2015). Sea level rise and related changes in depositional patterns could influence the pore pressure of the slope sediments and induce seismic activity, both with the potential to trigger submarine landslides (Trincardi et al., 2003; Brothers et al., 2013). Kremer et al. (2017) recognized a correlation between sea-level rise and MTD occurrence in a slope basin located seaward of the outer Kumano forearc high. However, more studies are still needed to establish a clear correlation between sea-level rise and MTD occurrence. Because of the high content of sandy turbidites throughout the basin, unit 2 is suspected to record a major time period of sea-level rise.\nClimatic controls are also important to consider in the sediment dynamics (e.g., denudation rate, erosion rate, increased volume of sediment discharge to the deep-marine basin). An important factor may be the intensification of the East Asian summer monsoon and related heavy precipitation events during the interglacial periods in Japan (Ono, 1984; Wang et al., 2001; Kimura et al., 2008; Shu et al., 2013). Intensification of the East Asian summer monsoon during the last deglaciation led to a significant increase in denudation rate and sediment discharge rate (Clift, 2006, 2020), enhanced by physical erosion (Molnar, 2001), as observed in the Himalaya and distal South Asian deltas during the early Holocene (Goodbred Jr and Kuehl, 2000). An increase in sediment delivery caused by the intensification of the monsoon, has also been inferred in the Gaoping Canyon, offshore Taiwan (Yu et al., 2017) as well as in the Active Channel in the Bengal Fan (Weber et al., 1997). In addition, typhoons started to be more frequent and intense in the central Japanese islands during deglaciation, causing major river floods and contributing significantly to the sediment-discharge volume to the deep sea (Sugai, 1993; Grossman, 2001; Ikehara et al., 2020). However, the control on the East Asian summer monsoon on sediment supply in the Kumano Basin has to be considered carefully as more data are needed, such as core data to confirm this hypothesis.\nAnother potentially parameter is glacial meltwater streams contributing to sediment discharge to the deep basin. Although mountain glaciation was maximum in Japan during MIS3\/4, several studies demonstrate the presence of glacial and periglacial landforms in the Central Japanese Alps during the Last Glacial Maximum and during the Younger Dryas (Kobayashi, 1958; Koizumi and Yanagimachi, 1982; Aoki, 2000; Ono et al., 2005), in particular in the Mt. Kiso-Komogatake (Aoki, 2000; Ono et al., 2005). The presence of glaciers in this area could contribute to an increase in glacial meltwater and associated sediment discharge to the Kiso river and thus to the Kumano Basin during deglaciation. However, no glaciers were documented in the Kii Peninsula. Thus, although the contribution to sediment discharge by the melting of the glaciers present in the Central Japanese Alps cannot be neglected, it does not seem to represent a major control on the sediment dynamic of the Kumano Basin during the last deglaciation.\n\n\n5.1.3\nStage 3 \u2013 transgression and development of the Ise Bay (~10\u202fka to ~7,8\/5,7\u202fka)\nAlthough the Ise Bay was most likely already partially flooded, the first effects of sea-level rise were recorded in the Ise Bay at ~10\u202fcal\u202fka BP, indicating the onset of the expansion of the bay and a marine environment within the Ise Bay (Umitsu, 1992; Masuda and Iwabuchi, 2003; Ogami et al., 2009). Because the base of unit 1 is dated at 10,394\u202fcal\u202fyr BP, sediments of unit 1 recorded the end of the transgression, as well as the highstand systems tract (Fig. 7). The only available marker to distinguish the deposits related to the transgressive systems tract from those of the highstand systems tract is the K-Ah tephra layer dated at ~7,3\u202fka (yellow horizon in Fig. 6) (Arita and Kinoshita, 1988; Fukusawa, 1995; Omura and Ikehara, 2010). Sediments deposited between the base of unit 1 and the K-Ah tephra layer are related to the time period of bay expansion and last episode of transgression (i.e., Stage 3). The marine expansion of the Ise Bay pushed the river mouth farther toward the hinterland and therefore most of the sediment-gravity flow deposits were trapped on the shelf and a minimum of coarse-grained sediment input reached the deep basin area (as postulated elsewhere by Posamentier and Vail, 1988). The expansion of the Ise Bay triggered one of the major changes in the deep-marine environment of the Kumano Basin with a rapid reduction in terrigenous sediment supply to the deep basin. This resulted in a continuous undisturbed drape of hemipelagic muds in the deep basin (Fig. 4, cross-section CD; Fig. 8). Compared with the deep basin, the proximal area of the basin (i.e., the Anoriguchi and Taiji canyon mouths and the northwestern platform) still received a significant amount of coarse-grained terrigenous materials, with a relatively higher proportion of sandy turbidites (e.g. below the K-Ah layer in Fig. 5D), suggesting similar sediment transport and depositional processes as to the underlying transgressive unit 2. Another evidence of the activity at the canyon mouth, is the presence of sediment waves in the Anoriguchi canyon mouth (Fig. 3A), similar to those imaged in the overbank-levee of the Taiwan Canyon (South China Sea, Li et al., 2021) or to the Monterey deep-sea fan levee (Normark et al., 1980). Although these sediment waves were likely active during the deposition of unit 3, upflow-dipping reflections observed in unit 1 (Fig. 4, cross-section AB) indicate that high-energetic flow reached the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth even during the flooding of the bay. No particular change is observed in the sediment supply and depositional processes between unit 2 and unit 1 in the northwestern platform area where alternation between hemipelagic and turbidites is observed throughout (see further discussion in Section 5.2 below).\n\n\n5.1.4\nStage 4 \u2013 highstand systems tract (~7,8\/5,7\u202fcal\u202fka BP to present)\nAccording to the analyses in the proximal area of the Anoriguchi Canyon, the beginning of the highstand systems tract is marked by the onset of delta progradation estimated between ~7,8\u202fcal\u202fka BP (Masuda and Iwabuchi, 2003) to ~5,7\u202fcal\u202fka BP (Umitsu, 1992) (Fig. 7). Because Ise Bay as well as the narrow shelf on the northwestern area of the basin were already flooded, the beginning of the highstand stage does not have a particular impact on the sediment supply to the Kumano Basin and it remains difficult to distinguish the deep-marine sediments deposited during the rise of sea level from those deposited during the highstand stage (i.e., maximum flooding surface). Given the age of the K-Ah tephra layer at ~7,3\u202fka, we consider the sediments above the K-Ah tephra layer to be deposited during the highstand stage (Fig. 5). As during the end of the transgressive period (Stage 3), the deep-basin deposits are composed of hemipelagic muds reflecting a starvation of the basin in terrigenous supply, whereas the proximal area of the basin is characterized by a significant amount of coarse-grained terrigenous sediments (Fig. 8). Although it is commonly believed that highstand periods are quiescent and dominated by mud deposition in most places, a wide range of triggering process such as earthquakes (Piper et al., 1999), tectonic oversteepening (Greene et al., 2006), depositional loading (Coleman and Prior, 1982), tsunamis (Wright and Rathje, 2003), and gas hydrate decomposition (Mienert et al., 2005) can induce slope instability and associated sediment failure and flow transformation in turbidity currents, leading to a relatively high sand input to the basin. Typhoons triggering major flooding in SW Japan also cause the transport of large amounts of terrigenous materials from land to the deep Kumano Basin (Ikehara et al., 2020). These different processes could explain the relatively high content of terrigenous sandy materials deposited in the northwestern platform and Taiji Canyon mouth as well as in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth during highstand stages (see further discussion in Section 5.2 below). Compared to the deposits below the K-Ah layer of Stage 3, we note a small decrease in the amount of turbidites in the Anoriguchi Canyon mouth.\n\n\n\n5.2\nShelf architecture and related controls\nAn important local parameter to consider in the sediment supply and distribution is the shelf width (Covault and Graham, 2010), which is highly dependent of the tectono-morphology of the study area. Our case study is interesting considering that the Kumano Basin is fed by two different source-to-sink systems with contrasting types of shelves, i.e.: (1) in the east, sediments are delivered by the Nagara, Ibi and Kiso rivers to the Ise Bay characterized as a wide shelf (>90\u202fkm), feeding the Kumano Basin through the Anoriguchi Canyon; and (2) in the northwest, sediments are delivered by one main river, the Kumano River with a drainage area of >2360\u202fkm2 (Ikehara et al., 2020) and several other secondary rivers through a very narrow shelf (<10\u202fkm). The distance between the Kumano river mouth and the head of the Shingu submarine canyon that incises the upper slope is <5\u202fkm (Shirai et al., 2010; Shirai and Hayashizaki, 2013).\nIn the wide-shelf source-to-sink system, the expansion of the Ise Bay at ~10\u202fcal\u202fka BP produced significant changes in the sediment supply to the Kumano Basin with a drastic decrease in coarse-grained terrigenous sediments to the deep-basin area (Fig. 4; cross-sections AB and CD; Fig. 7), where most of the sediment-gravity flow bedload is stored on the shelf, showing a greater accommodation space. However, in the narrow-shelf source-to-sink system, no particular change in sediment supply (between unit 2 and unit 1) is observed in the northwestern platform, with a persistent sandy terrigenous sediment supply after ~10\u202fka. Indeed, the proximal area of the northwestern platform (Shingu Canyon mouth \u2013 e.g., Fig. 3, cross section GH; and Taiji canyon mouth \u2013 e.g., Fig. 3, cross-section EF) does not show significant changes in terms of sediment supply throughout the deglaciation period except for a progressive increase in coarse-grained terrigenous material starting during the deposition of unit 3a.\nShelf architecture is not only dependent on sea-level fluctuation and the rate of sediment supply (e.g., Swift and Thorne, 1991; Henriksen et al., 2011, and references therein) but is also highly controlled by the regional tectonic movements (uplift vs subsidence; Pratson et al., 2007). In active margin settings, shelf morphology and associated stratigraphic architecture are mainly controlled by off-shore seismo-tectonic processes (Orange, 1999; Johnson et al., 2020). Coastal areas in active convergent margins are usually associated with uplifted narrow continental shelves, steep continental slopes deeply incised by variably fault-controlled submarine canyons and prolific sediment producers contributing significantly to the deep-marine sedimentation budget (Pratson et al., 2007). Because of high-recurrence rate earthquakes related to the Nankai subduction megathrust, the hanging wall of the megathrust shows a significant rate of uplift (Agar et al., 1989; Sato and Matsu'ura, 1992; Savage, 1995). This is likely causing a relatively narrow shelf along the Kii Peninsula where the rate of continental shelf uplift along the Kii Peninsula is controlled by the rate of plate convergence and the configuration of the plate boundary (Sato and Matsu'ura, 1992). Because of the close proximity between the rivers and canyon heads along the northwestern area of the Kumano Basin, sediments are directly transferred to the deep-marine systems even during highstands and thus the sea-level variation does not affect the sediment-routing system (Figs. 7 and 8). Because of its narrow shelf-architecture, the northwestern platform could be considered as a sustained system that received a continued sediment supply through the glacial and interglacial cycles.\nThe uplifted regions parallel to the Nankai Trough are not continuous and some subsiding regions exist (Kimura et al., 2008), such as the Nobi Plain and facing Ise Bay (Sugai and Sugiyama, 1999). In the case of the wide-shelf source-to-sink system, sea-level rise coupled with the subsidence of the Ise bay (~1\u202fm\/ka during the Quaternary; Sugai and Sugiyama, 1999) resulted in the increase in accommodation space in the bay (as observed by Hori et al., 2011) as well as a complete disconnection between the river system and deep-marine system (>90\u202fkm), both explaining the significant decrease in terrigenous sandy sediment supply to the deep-marine environment of the Kumano Basin (Figs. 7 and 8). The sediment dynamics in the case of the wide-shelf source-to-sink system of the Kumano Basin result in the highest sediment supply during lowstand and beginning of transgression regime.\n\n\n5.3\nComparison with other source-to-sink systems along the Nankai subduction zone and other convergent margins\nIn addition to the Kumano forearc basin, there are three other forearc basins along the Nankai margin: the Muroto, Tosa and Hyuga basins (Fig. 1A). The Tosa and Muroto deep-marine systems, undergoing similar climatic and eustatic fluctuations than the Kumano Basin, show similar glacial\/interglacial stratigraphic patterns as the Kumano forearc basin, i.e., lowstand-related coarse-grained sediment-gravity flows in the deep-marine basin, whereas the Holocene deposits are defined by a transparent acoustic facies interpreted as hemipelagites (Blum and Okamura, 1992). The shelf morphology suggests a wide-shelf source-to-sink system being consistent with the main control factor for the infill of Kumano forearc basin (see Section 5.2 above).\nOn a larger scale, the Nankai Trough (Fig. 1), mainly fed by trench-parallel (axial) sediment-gravity flows derived from the Izu\u2013Honshu collision zone funneled through the Suruga canyon and to a lesser extent by the Tenryu canyon (Fig. 1A; Shimamura, 1988), is dominated by a succession of thick sandy turbidites intercalated with thin hemipelagites (e.g., Taira and Niitsuma, 1986; Pickering et al., 1992; Underwood et al., 1993). Since the feeder canyons cross a very narrow continental shelf (e.g., Yoshikawa and Nemoto, 2010), the stratigraphic pattern observed in the Nankai trough is in agreement with a narrow-shelf source-to-sink system that provided sustained flow of coarse-grained sediments to the trench during the Pleistocene\/Holocene deglaciation.\nAs along the Nankai margin, the Hikurangi subduction margin (New Zealand) is undergoing general uplift with local zones of subsidence creating coastal flood plains and mid-shelf basins (Carter et al., 2010). The northern area of the Hikurangi margin shows a decrease in sediment supply to the deep-marine basins during the last sea-level rise (e.g., Waipaoa source-to-sink system; Orpin, 2004; Pouderoux et al., 2012; Kuehl et al., 2016) with sediment accumulating on the shelf where there was an increase in accommodation space due to tectonic-induced subsidence (Gerber et al., 2010). In contrast, the deep-marine environment of the southern margin, characterized by a narrow shelf, is defined by relatively sustained sediment supply throughout the sea-level rise and the presence of an upstream-migrating knickpoint, testifying to the canyon activity during the highstand period (e.g., Cook Strait deep-marine system; Mountjoy et al., 2009; Micallef et al., 2014). Another example is the deep-marine environment of the Cascadia margin with a relatively continuous continental shelf width between ~20\u202fkm and ~60\u202fkm. It is characterized by a contrasting depositional pattern between the lowstand-related high accumulation rate of coarse-grained sandy turbidites and the highstand period mainly defined by hemipelagites (e.g., Astoria and Nitinat fans; Carlson and Nelson, 1969; Knudson and Hendy, 2009). Both the Hikurangi and Cascadia margins and their related deep-marine stratigraphic patterns are in accordance with our concept of narrow-to-wide shelf-controlled deep-marine systems as described for the Kumano forearc basin in Section 5.2.\nIn contrast to the Nankai and Hikurangi margins, other deep-marine systems along active convergent margins have their stratigraphic patterns predominantly controlled by other factors such as strong climatic fluctuations (i.e., arid to humid conditions: Chilean margin \u2013Blumberg et al., 2008; Bernhardt et al., 2016, 2017; Makran margin \u2013 Prins et al., 2000; Bourget et al., 2010a) or the presence of bottom currents redirecting shelf sediments to the deep-marine basin (e.g., deep-marine system along the southern Chilean margin; Bernhardt et al., 2016). In these cases, the shelf morphology appears as a secondary controlling factor on the deep-marine stratigraphic pattern.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study evaluates the deglaciation effects and related controlling parameters on the deep-marine sediment dynamics of the forearc Kumano Basin. Based on a detailed analysis of a subbottom profiler dataset, we recognize three seismic units:\n\n(i)\nUnit 3 is the oldest and thickest unit. This unit is dominated by chaotic deposits such as debris- and mud-flow deposits intercalated with some turbidites. Only a few mass-transport deposits are observed at the top of the unit. Unit 3 is thought to have been deposited during a sea-level lowstand. The increase in sandy material at the top of unit 3 is either associated with the Last Glacial Maximum or with the onset of the transgression.\n\n\n(ii)\nUnit 2 overlying unit 3, shows an increased content in sandy turbidites compared to unit 3, most likely as a consequence of the deglaciation. Turbidites are dominant and intercalated with some debris-flow deposits and layers of hemipelagic muds. Unit 2 is most likely related to the sea-level rise stage.\n\n\n(iii)\nUnit 1, the youngest unit, is dominated by hemipelagic deposits in the deep basin, whereas a significantly high content of sandy turbidites is observed in the proximal areas. By integrating core data of Omura and Ikehara (2010), the base of unit 1 is dated at ~10\u202fka. The base of unit 1 corresponds to the onset of Ise Bay expansion at ~10\u202fka as a consequence of sea-level rise. This induces a drastic reduction in sediment supply to the deep basin (basin starvation) with the sandy materials constrained to the proximal area of the basin.\n\n\n\nThe data summarized above reveal that during the last interglacial period, there was an interplay between (i) global sea-level rise inducing an increase in accommodation space in the shelf environment, causing a retreat of the deep-marine system and therefore having a direct control on the sediment distribution; with (ii) tectonically-controlled shelf morphology where the rate of uplift and subsidence along the active margin are likely controlling the shelf width. Although it is not defined as a major control, climatic fluctuation, especially the intensification of the East Asian summer monsoon, could participate to an increase in sandy material to the deep basin during sea-level rise.\nOur Kumano Basin case study further demonstrates the important effect of the shelf architecture on the sediment dynamics of a deep-marine environment. Under similar eustatic and climatic variation, the narrow shelf system (high uplift rate) provides a persistent sandy sediment supply throughout the deglaciation, even during the highstand stage. On the contrary, and as expected, a progressive decrease in sandy sediment supply in the eastern side of the basin at the end of transgressive stage and under highstand conditions is most likely related to the development of the subsiding Ise Bay. Our concept of a narrow-to-wide shelf-controlled deep-marine stratigraphic pattern is in agreement with the deep-marine stratigraphic pattern observed in the forearc basins and the trench elsewhere along the Nankai subduction zone as well as in the deep-marine environments along the Hikurangi and Cascadia margins.\nThis study shows the importance of high-resolution shallow seismic data in sequence stratigraphic analysis in identifying the depositional sequence at a basin-wide scale, giving impressive details for the last glacial\u2013interglacial cycle. This is essential in order to later build a reliable long time-scale stratigraphic model based on deeper seismic data and reconstruct the sequence stratigraphic evolution in convergent settings involving active tectonic deformation. This paper presents the first steps of an on-going large temporal- and spatial-scale sequence stratigraphic study that aims to deconvolve tectonic from glacio-eustatic forcings on the morphodynamics of the forearc Kumano Basin.\n\n","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nMicrobialites are organosedimentary deposits produced by benthic microbial communities (Burne and Moore, 1987). Carbonate precipitation is currently considered as the main mechanism for microbialite development, but trapping and binding of allochthonous sediments is also important in modern wave and current-swept marine environments (Monty, 1976; Riding, 2000; Dupraz et al., 2009; Reitner, 2011; Della Porta, 2015; Suarez-Gonzalez et al., 2019). Apart from the various questions about how different biotic and abiotic are involved to form these deposits, a key question is what controls their spatial distribution, and how does this spatial distribution get recorded as heterogenous carbonate strata? Substrate and antecedent karst topography are important controls for coral reef growth and spatial distribution (Purdy and Bertram, 1993), and expected for microbial reefs as well (Grotzinger and Knoll, 1999). For example, microbial colonization and growth appear to have some genetic link to low-relief tepee structures formed during lake level lowstands (Warren, 1982; Coshell et al., 1998; Bouton et al., 2016). These large-scale polygons are well developed in modern marine and non-marine settings, where their density and spacing are laterally variable. If microbialites occurrence and morphology is predominantly dependent on underlying topography (Logan et al., 1974; Ginsburg and Planavsky, 2008), microbialite mound spacing will be similarly variable, difficult to predict and perhaps difficult to interpret in terms of paleoenvironment. However, study from modern coral reef suggests another self-organization possibility (Schlager and Purkis, 2013, 2015; Purkis et al., 2016) that can potentially be applicable to microbial system where spatial interactions between water, topography, sediment transport, and microbialite growth can explain the observed microbialite spatial distributions, such that microbialite mounds self-organize to generate predictable autogenic patterns, independent of the initial conditions, and representing an important record of paleoenvironmental conditions.\nPrevious studies of microbialite morphology and distribution are mostly based on field observations and interpretations, including both modern (Gebelein, 1969; Andres and Reid, 2006; Jahnert and Collins, 2012; Suosaari et al., 2016; Baskin et al., 2021) and ancient examples (Wood et al., 2002; Bosak et al., 2013; Andrews and Trewin, 2014; Bahniuk et al., 2015). However, these studies rarely address how microbial mats interact with adjacent sediment, how the interplay between mound expansion and smothering is linked to macroscopic morphologies, or their large-scale structure and spatial distribution. Also, little emphasis has been placed on experimental and quantitative studies of microbialite growth, to explore how they respond to changes in various environmental factors such as water depth, light intensity, sedimentation rate, and hydrodynamic condition. For example, how microbial mat growth is controlled by substrate topography and how it interacts with sediment flux? What morphology they produce in strata, and how this is reflected on the growth history? Conversely, what factors smother and bury microbial communities, and require recolonisation to recommence deposition? What does this tell us about microbial communities and depositional environment? Characterising, quantifying, and understanding these fundamental processes and their environmental sensitivities with Stromatobyte3D would be an important step forward to fill this gap by testing current hypothesized controlling factors and empirical growth rules.\nA recent study of modern microbially-induced bedforms on intertidal flats, shows internal horizontal laminations and regularly spaced ridge-runnel morphological patterns due to extensive biofilm-induced sediment trapping and binding. The patterns are strikingly similar to microbialite strata found in the geological record from the Precambrian onwards (van de Vijsel et al., 2019). Coral reefs grow as individual patches can coalesce and develop reticular patterns in Holocene lagoons due to biotic self-organization (Schlager and Purkis, 2015; Purkis et al., 2016), and in fact microbialites can also develop comparable patterns at scales of tens to hundreds of meters (Dill et al., 1986; Suosaari et al., 2016). Previous numerical modelling (Johnson and Grotzinger, 2006) noted that stromatolites can adjust their column widths during deposition and the effects of initial topography may therefore become progressively weaker as they grow. These studies all display at least one diagnostic feature of spatial self-organization, such as formation of coherent spatial pattern and preferred orientation. Observed features are independent of an initial condition (Levin and Segel, 1985; Purkis et al., 2016), and autogenic in origin, so formed independent of any external forcing (Xi and Burgess, 2022 in press).\nTo address these questions, a new three-dimensional numerical stratigraphic forward model, Stromatobyte3D, has been developed and integrated with field observation to calculate microbialite accumulation, unravel their complex morphology and spatial distribution in response to external controls, and explore the possibility of self-organizing behaviours as a form of autogenic dynamics in carbonate geomorphic and stratigraphic development.\n\n\n2\nModel formulation and input parameters\nMicrobialite strata accumulate due to a combination of microbially-induced in-situ precipitation, and trapping and binding of ambient suspended sediment on sticky microbial mats, both controlled by various different biological, chemical and physical processes. Consequently, numerical models of microbialite accumulations require explicit and implicit calculation of several interacting physical, chemical and biological processes. The modelled process and product represent modern agglutinated microbialites in marine environments, such as Shark Bay and the Bahamas, where both in-situ precipitation and sediment trapping and binding are important accumulation processes (Logan, 1961; Dravis, 1983; Reid et al., 2000; Riding, 2011a; Suarez-Gonzalez et al., 2019).\nStromatobyte3D is a reduced-complexity model designed to simulate microbial mound development on the scale of a few meters for each mound. It was modified and developed from a previous model, Mounds3D in Kozlowski (2016). Stromatobyte3D calculates both vertical and lateral microbialite growth, controlled predominantly by hydrodynamic conditions and a background sedimentation rate that deposits non-microbialite lithologies such as packstone and wackestone.\n\n2.1\nCalculation of hydrodynamic flow magnitude\nStromatobyte3D includes a simple hydrodynamic model which calculates flow magnitude for each point on the model grid (Fig. 1\n). This flow magnitude represents flow due to waves and other currents, flowing on one dominant direction (Fig. 1A) but all interacting with the topography they flow over, and time-averaged over the duration of the model time step, in this case one year. A hydrodynamic flow field is calculated that represents a water flux vector in each grid cell, based on flow streamlines that follow the defined dominant direction, but refracted by topography in shallow water (Martinez and Harbaugh, 1989; Burgess and Wright, 2003) (Fig. 1B). Flow magnitude Mfm, defined and calculated as the water flux going through each cell, is higher where streamlines converge due to refraction (Fig. 1C), representing a situation where over the course of the whole time step duration, more water flows at relatively higher velocity through the model cell relative to other cells where flow magnitude is lower. A boundary flow magnitude is added to the calculated flow magnitude map, which forces a minimum flow magnitude of 20 streamlines per time step across the whole model grid to ensure some transport of sediment in suspension occurs during each time step.\n\n\n2.2\nCalculation of packstone deposition from suspension\nThe model can accumulate one of two different lithofacies in any model cell at each time step. A packstone or wackestone lithofacies is deposited due to settling of suspended sediment. Rate of deposition from suspension d\n\nsusp\n is controlled by both the topographic gradient and water-flow magnitude. Allochthonous sediment in suspension enters one side of the model grid at a constant rate (Curtis et al., 2021), and deposits packstone at highest rates on grid cells with low surface gradient and low flow magnitude (Fig. 2\n). Maximum rate of deposition from suspension occurs when surface gradient is zero, and flow magnitude is at the minimum boundary condition value. Conversely, packstone deposition is zero where surface gradient reaches and exceeds the critical angle of repose, or flow magnitude is relatively high and favours grain trapping and binding. The critical angle of repose is set to be 20o, which is a reasonable value for granular silt-sized sediment (Beakawi Al-Hashemi and Baghabra Al-Amoudi, 2018).\n\n\n2.3\nCalculation of microbialite accumulation\nAt each time-step \u2206t iteration of the model, the height of each grid cell is updated to reflect accumulation of microbialite structure or deposition of suspended sediment. In Stromatobyte3D, microbial colonization and microbialite accumulation can occur in any grid cell where there is no suspended sediment has been deposited for the last two time step iterations. The effects of microbial colonization R, in-situ precipitation g\n\np\n, implicit trapping and binding growth rate g\n\ntb1 modified by water flow magnitude Mfm, a growth term gd dependent on the bathymetric slope, and explicit trapping and binding growth rate g\n\ntb2 are all combined to calculate change in height of the topographic cell \u2206h\n(x,y) such that:\n\n(1)\n\n\u2206\n\nh\n\nx\ny\n\n\n=\n\nR\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n\ng\np\n\n+\n\ng\n\ntb\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2217\n\u2206\nt\n+\n\n\n\ng\n\ntb\n1\n\n\n\u2217\n\u2206\nt\n+\n\ng\n\nd\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2217\n\nM\n\nfm\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere each term is calculated as described in the following sections.\n\n2.3.1\nMicrobialite growth by in-situ precipitation and implicit trapping and binding\nSince Stromatobyte3D is designed to model small-scale mound development, it is assumed that maximum in-situ precipitation rate is constant across the model grid and not directly water-depth-dependent. The simplest element of microbialite precipitation is therefore modelled as a spatially-uniform process, controlled by the precipitation rate parameter g\n\np\n.\nTrapping and incorporation of loose sediment into the microbialites is a complex process, since it depends on the characteristics of the microbial mat, hydrodynamics, and transported sediment in suspension. Water flow is a key environmental factor controlling growth of microbialites due to abundant trapping of sediment, because frequent water movement can mobilize sediments and supply them onto the microbialite surface (Riding, 2000; Andres and Reid, 2006; Suarez-Gonzalez et al., 2019). However, high flow velocities hinder sediment trapping, or, in more extreme cases not modelled here, lead to erosion (Bosak et al., 2013). Conversely, low-energy settings with slow but non-zero water flow rates often prevent the healthy development of microbialites if mats are buried by muddy sediment (Johnson and Grotzinger, 2006; Andrews and Trewin, 2014; Curtis et al., 2021).\nIn Stromatobyte3D trapping and binding is calculated in two ways during each model iteration, once using an implicit calculation controlled by the input parameter g\n\ntb1, hydrodynamic flow rate, and bathymetric slope, followed by a second calculation that explicitly accounts for the rate of trapping and binding of suspended sediment and potential poisoning effects based on the depositional rate of suspended sediment d\n\nsusp\n on each model grid cell. In the implicit calculation, sediment transport and agglutination from suspension into the microbial mat is not directly modelled at this stage of the model iteration for time step, but instead the implicit calculation represents vertical and lateral accretion by trapping of sediment into the sticky microbial mats and importantly, accounts for trapping over high slope gradients where suspended sediment would not normally be deposited (Kozlowski, 2016).\nModelled growth by precipitation and implicit trapping and binding includes both vertical and lateral growth. For a grid cell (x,y) with elevation h, each grid cell has a surface area determined by the cell size, and it can accrete material in one of the five directions (z+, x+, x\u2212, y+, y\u2212), where z+ is vertical growth and the x and y variants are lateral growth. Lateral growth is calculated implicitly as a small-scale smoothing process that tends to reduce mound surface relief (Grotzinger and Rothman, 1996; Kozlowski, 2016), and it occurs when the elevation of a cell x,y is lower than any of the four adjacent cells. In this case, all of the higher cell(s) can accrete laterally into this central cell at different rates, depending on their own vertical growth rates. When the cumulative lateral accretion exceeds the cell size, the elevation of this cell (h) will be increased up to the elevation of the lowest neighbour cell (Fig. 3\n).\n\n\n2.3.2\nEffect of hydrodynamics on implicit trapping and binding\nFor the implicit calculation, rate of microbialite growth due to trapping and binding is assumed to be proportional to the rate of deposition from suspension, controlled by flow magnitude Mfm which acts as a growth-rate modifier, following a symmetrically increasing then decreasing profile as flow magnitude increases (Fig. 4A). Growth rate is highest at the specified optimal trapping and binding level (Fig. 4A), representing the maximum rate of sediment input that can be captured and stabilised by the microbial community. It is assumed that a further increase of flow magnitude will decrease the mat's ability to trap passing sediment because the grains are moving too fast to be optimally trapped, or because the higher suspended sediment flux risks burying the microbial mat.\n\n\n2.3.3\nEffect of slope on microbialite trapping and binding\nAlthough microbial mats can trap and bind sediment at high slope gradients, settling of sediment from suspension tends to accumulate in topographic lows, so the growth rate due to sediment trapping will be potentially increased in depressions. Another term affecting microbialite growth rate by trapping and binding (gd) is used to represent the effects of slope on sediment trapping. Following the approach from Johnson and Grotzinger (2006), it is calculated using the second derivative of the bottom surface multiplied by a user-defined diffusion coefficient (k\n\ntb\n, in m2 per year):\n\n(2)\n\n\ng\n\nd\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nh\n\nx\n\ny\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n+\n\nh\n\nx\n\ny\n+\n1\n\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\u2217\n\nh\n\nx\ny\n\n\n+\n\nh\n\n\nx\n\u2212\n1\n\ny\n\n\n+\n\nh\n\n\nx\n+\n1\n\ny\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\u2217\n\nh\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\nd\n2\n\n\n\u2217\n\nk\ntb\n\n\n\nwhere d is cell length, x and y are cell coordinates, h is elevation and ktb is diffusion coefficient. As the value of ktb increases, mound surface curvature at the previous time step will have a stronger control on the surface at this time step.\n\n\n2.3.4\nMicrobialite growth by explicit trapping and binding and sediment poisoning\nIn the end of each time step iteration, if suspended sediment deposition and microbialite growth both occur in the same grid cell at this iteration, part or all of the suspended sediment will be trapped and directly incorporated into microbialite growth, depending on the threshold trapping and binding rate tb, which is an input parameter (Fig. 4B). Alternatively, if suspended sediment deposition exceeds 2tb, microbial mounds will be smothered due to sediment poisoning, so R\n(x,y)\u202f=\u202f0 and recolonisation is then required to recommence microbialite accumulation. Explicit trapping does not occur in cells if only occupied by one lithofacies.\n\n\n\n2.4\nModel cases and input parameters\nFour models are run to understand how different modelled processes interact and what stratal patterns they can produce. Each model run is a numerical experiment to explore the consequences of one particular set of input parameters and modelled processes. The first experiment demonstrates a non-self-organized case with strong inheritance from the initial surface. Model elements are then progressively added in cases 2, 3, and 4, to explore how each additional factor controls the strata (Table 1\n). Input parameters are based on reasonable, constrained values used in previous study of marine microbial carbonate systems (Johnson and Grotzinger, 2006; Jahnert and Collins, 2012; Kozlowski, 2016; Curtis et al., 2021).\nAll four model cases use a 100 by 100 orthogonal regular model grid consisting of 10,000 data points in total. The grid point spacing is 0.5\u202fm, so the total grid represents a 50x50m area. Initial topography (Fig. 5\n) is a smoothed random surface with synoptic relief up to 0.5\u202fm, which is comparable to substrates in many modern and ancient microbialite systems (Coshell et al., 1998; Ginsburg and Planavsky, 2008; Coulson, 2016; Gallois et al., 2018). Each model time step is one year, and a total of 250 time steps yield 250\u202fyears of total elapsed model time (EMT). Initial water depth is 1\u202fm, increasing through relative sea-level rise to 2.5\u202fm in the end of model run.\nModern microbialites commonly have multiple phases of accumulation (Paull et al., 1992; Jahnert and Collins, 2012; Carvalho et al., 2018), and the averaged growth rate decreases with increasing time span of observation (Table 2\n) (Sadler, 1981; Schlager, 1999), so the input maximum growth rate is set to 5\u202fmm per year, and a total of 250\u202fyears EMT can produce microbialites with height of approximately 1\u202fm or less, consistent with observations from modern systems, such as Shark Bay (Playford et al., 2013), Bahamas (Dravis, 1983), and Bermuda (Gebelein, 1969). Maximum accumulation rate of suspended sediment is 4\u202fmm per year, which is a reasonable rate for non-compacted sediment to be deposited and form packstones in marine settings.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nExperiment 1: isolated microbialite columns\nIn this simplest experiment, there is no hydrodynamic process modelled, sediment can still be transported in suspension, but hydrodynamics has no direct influence on accumulation of either modelled lithofacies. Since finer-grained sediment in suspension tends to inhibit and poison in-situ microbialite growth, microbialite nucleation and growth therefore occurs preferentially on stable topographic highs less than 2\u202fm in width where sedimentation rate from suspension is lowest because of the higher topographic gradients. Reduced poisoning and burial from suspension leads to increased mat accretion and survivability. In contrast, growth is inhibited in topographic lows where a higher sedimentation rate suppresses and overwhelms microbial growth (Johnson and Grotzinger, 2006; Della Porta, 2015; Baskin et al., 2021). Results of experiment 1 show many distinct isolated small microbialite columns, about 1\u20131.5\u202fm in width and less than 1\u202fm in height scattered across the model surface in a visually random distribution (Fig. 6\n). In planform, the spatial distribution and geometry of these mounds is predominantly inherited from the distribution of high areas on the initial surface, with no preferred orientation. This strong substrate control can be also seen in cross section (Fig. 7\n), where most of the mounds are growing on top of initial topographic highs; percentage of surface points occupied by actively growing and accreting mats at the end of model run indicates that, microbialite areal coverage in experiment 1 is only 13.78% (Table 3\n).\n\n\n3.2\nExperiment 2: elongated microbialites\nA dominant flow direction is imposed in experiment 2, from the bottom of the grid towards the top. In comparison to experiment 1, microbial mounds preferentially nucleate, either on narrow steep-gradient topographic highs where only limited amount of suspended sediment can accumulate, or on the margins of broad antecedent topographic highs or previous build-ups where flow magnitude is relatively high. The latter creates some spatial interactions between topography, hydrodynamics, and mat accretion, which creates some relatively large build-ups because subsequent growth preferentially occurs next to pre-existing microbial mounds. Aligned mounds are mostly several meters long, some can grow up to 8\u202fm, apparently elongated and aligned in the defined current direction (Fig. 6). Some microbialites have composite forms in planform due to lateral accretion and coalescence (Fig. 7). As well as elongated mounds, these growth patterns also lead to some relatively large gaps between microbial mounds that do not simply reflect the underlying initial topography; topographic highs in these areas have been buried rather than growing mounds. There are still many small and isolated mounds, similar to experiment 1, but the overall microbial mound distribution shows an increased degree of clumping and coherency, total microbialite volume percentage is lower, areal coverage is increased by 1.42% relative to experiment 1 (Table 3), and the dependence of mound growth on initial condition is reduced.\n\n\n3.3\nExperiment 3: microbialite ridges and Y-junctions\nIn experiment 3, calculated water flow magnitude is a control on the rate of packstone sedimentation from suspension, but not directly on the microbialite growth rate. This weakens the influence of substrate topography on sedimentation rate compared to experiments 1 and 2. Sedimentation from suspension preferentially occurs in tranquil areas where flow magnitude is relatively low, and because suspended sediment inhibits and \u2018poisons\u2019 in-situ microbialite growth, mound survivability is higher where flow magnitude is high. Consequently, microbialites in this experiment are much more elongated and well-connected than experiment 2, forming microbialite ridges across the entire model grid, separated by packstone-covered runnels (Fig. 6). The ridges are subparallel to each other, elongated parallel to input flow direction, and extend across a significant portion of the entire model surface. Some ridges develop \u2018Y-shaped\u2019 junctions, opening in the direction of flow, where two adjacent mounds accrete and migrate laterally, eventually leading to downstream coalescence. Microbialite areal coverage is increased by 20% and volume percentage by 9% relative to experiment 2. Despite this control by flow magnitude, there are still some persistently accumulating small mounds located over topographic highs on the initial surface. In cross section, because many microbialites can trap and incorporate suspended sediment, they expand laterally and prograde over adjacent sediment (Fig. 7). The stromatolite strata are inclined, with bedding surfaces dipping in the flow direction, and faster accretion rates facing up-current.\n\n\n3.4\nExperiment 4: ridges and runnels\nExperiment 4 has the most complex model formulation and strongest spatial feedbacks between model components. Flow magnitude determines rates of both in-situ growth and sedimentation from suspension, which in turn modify topography and the spatial distribution of flow magnitude. Topography-flow-sedimentation interactions create a well-organized \u2018ridge-and-runnel\u2019 pattern across the entire model surface, elongated parallel to flow direction (Fig. 6). Lateral growth and coalescence of adjacent stromatolites is most common and prevalent in this experiment (Fig. 7), isolated mounds rarely occur (Fig. 6). Such strong mound elongation with rapid accretion only in the flow direction explains the absence of \u2018Y-shaped\u2019 junctions because lateral accretion perpendicular to the flow direction is significantly suppressed in this more strongly directional hydrodynamic setting. Microbialite growth is no longer controlled by initial topography because the microbialite ridges generate strong feedbacks between flow, sedimentation, and topography as they develop and adjust their positions. Formation of coherent ridge patterns, produced by spatial feedbacks, and independent of initial condition, is evidence of spatial self-organization. These patterns also significantly increase the microbialite areal coverage to 42%, though the total volume percentage in this experiment is actually lower than experiment 3, and very close to experiment 1. This contradiction is due to strong upward-expansion of microbialite growth as microbialites expand their top surfaces over underlying old laminae (Figs. 7 & 11).\n\n\n3.5\nComparison with modern Shark Bay stromatolites\nModelled microbialites are compared with modern agglutinated stromatolites in Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Australia. Jahnert and Collins (2012) provided a detailed substrate map with bathymetry data (Fig. 8\n). Playford et al. (2013) conducted a regional geological survey of Shark Bay with many useful field and aerial photos to show different stromatolite structures and their distributions around the margins of Hamelin Pool. The study includes both the well-known locations on the eastern and south-eastern margins, and various locations on the west margin that have not previously been studied and reported. Based on high-resolution mapping and extensive in-water observations, Suosaari et al. (2016) recognised several distinct \u2018stromatolite provinces\u2019 around the margins of Hamelin Pool, each with characteristic morphologies, geographic distribution, and substrate gradient. These previous studies provide important information and data that allow a comparison between this model and field observations.\nModelled microbial mounds are strikingly similar to observed stromatolite morphologies (Fig. 9\n). Classic individual stromatolite columns in experiment 1 correspond to the Flagpole Province in the southeast, where substrate gradient is relatively gentle. Stromatolite heads can merge occasionally. The elongated form of stromatolites in experiment 2 are referred to as \u2018longitudinal stromatolites\u2019 by Playford et al. (2013), they also have composite forms due to aggregation of adjacent stromatolite heads. They can be found in the Carbla Province on the eastern margin and the Spaven Province on the western margin. Stromatolite ridges in experiments 3 and 4 can be found on the south-western margins, near Booldah well, where they are north-south oriented, parallel to prevailing wind direction. They are also referred to as seif structures (Playford et al., 2013), separated by bare sandy areas, some develop Y-junctions opening to the south (Fig. 8). Playford et al. (2013) also noted that some stromatolites in the south of Carbla Point are apparently inclined towards prevailing wind direction, resulting from rapid accretion of a mixture of carbonate and siliciclastic sand particles on the side exposed to up-current flow. These elongated forms with asymmetric features are also observed in Bahamas (Dravis, 1983; Dill et al., 1986), Bermuda (Gebelein, 1969), and are consistent with our modelling results (Fig. 7).\n\n\n3.6\nComparison with ancient outcrop observations\nGiven the modelling results and the striking visual similarity to modern microbialite depositional systems, an important question is how model results compare to ancient strata. Many previous studies have highlighted the difference between modern and ancient microbialites in their shape, size, fabric, and accretion processes, due to long term evolution of microbial mats and environmental changes (Grotzinger and Knoll, 1999; Reid et al., 2000; Riding, 2011b). Ancient elongated stromatolite morphologies are rare, with a few exceptions, such as those Early Proterozoic examples on the shore of Great Slave Lake, North West Territories, Canada (Hoffman, 1974), and Middle Old Red sandstone sequence of Orcadian Basin, Scotland (Andrews and Trewin, 2014). Coulson (2016) studied a 13\u202fm-thick vertical succession of subtidal microbialites in western Utah, US, which provides a useful ancient analogue to be compared with this model and modern observations above. He found this upper Cambrian succession shows a symmetric trend in terms of sediment grain size and microbialite length (Fig. 10\n), passing from fully detached round to ellipsoidal forms at the base, to slightly elongated and aligned forms, and well developed large microbialite ridges in the middle of succession. Then ridges retrograded back to slightly elongated forms and eventually to small, isolated forms at the top. This succession is interpreted to record a progressive increase of hydrodynamic energy with increasingly strong influence on sedimentation patterns to facilitate lateral accretion and coalescence to develop elongated microbialite ridges (Coulson, 2016), as we see from experiments 1 to 4. Ridge formation is followed by the exactly opposing trend, as accommodation increases, the hydrodynamic influence on sedimentation patterns becomes progressively weaker, and eventually current action is minimal at the top of succession.\n\n\n\n4\nQuantitative analysis of modelled microbialite geometries\n\n4.1\nEvolution of growth and suspended sediment deposition\nMicrobialite morphologies are fundamentally controlled by both growth and adjacent sedimentation rates, and these can exhibit complex spatial and temporal evolution (Grotzinger and Rothman, 1996; Grotzinger and Knoll, 1999; Della Porta, 2015; Curtis et al., 2021). Both rates can be measured in Stromatolite3D (Fig. 11\n). Many qualitative interpretations of outcrops and related depositional models suggest a balance between growth and sedimentation developing after a certain time, but none of the four experiments shows any evidence for such equilibrium being reached. In experiment 1, microbial growth is progressively restricted and buried by adjacent onlapping sediment, and mounds show a transition from aggradation to retrogradation in cross section (Fig. 7). The other three experiments show exactly the opposite trend, with fast in-situ growth dominating, so mounds prograde and amalgamate laterally, and inter-mound sedimentation becomes more spatially restricted through time. Interestingly, the highest mound planform coverage seen in experiment 4 is not just due to higher growth rate, because growth rate in experiment 4 is lower than experiments 2 and 3. This apparent contradiction suggests an operation of some more complex processes, most likely an element of spatial self-organization, perhaps similar to the modern reticulate reef patterns (Purkis et al., 2015; Schlager and Purkis, 2015), or to modern mussels beds that generate regular ridges with erosion by tidal flows in between (Rietkerk and van de Koppel, 2008). In that case, spatial feedbacks between in-situ growth rate and deposition from suspension lead to mound growth optimised along ridges parallel to waves and tidal currents. Isolated mound growth is less optimal for it to survive, so it is rare in a mature and more organized system, such as experiment 4, but still present in experiments 2 and 3 where spatial feedbacks are less developed.\n\n\n4.2\nDependence on initial surface: topography correlation coefficient (R)\nDependence of microbial mound growth on initial topography is analysed quantitatively to test these interpretations of self-organization. If these mounds are self-organized, their occurrences and positions should be independent of initial surface topography. A new metric, topography correlation coefficient (R), is constructed and used to quantify the degree of dependence on initial surface. It is simply defined as the proportion of the highest 20% of the points on the initial surface that persist as high points on the final surface (Fig. 12\n). Nearly half of the mounds in experiment 1 grow directly on initial highs. Experiment 2 represents a transitional case where the initial surface still determines some of the microbialite occurrences, but interaction between mound growth and hydrodynamics allows lateral accretion to develop longitudinal mounds, causing a decrease of R to 0.310. The final two experiments both develop microbialite ridges, with R values around 0.250, suggesting a very weak dependence on the initial surface. It is important to note that R values cannot be zero, because high points on the initial surface are randomly distributed, and even if these is no causal link between initial and final high points, some elevated points on the final microbialite surface will always be coincidental to initial topographic highs due to upward-expansion of microbial mounds.\nThe sensitivity of the high points criteria to the selected proportion of highest points on the initial surface is also tested, and the results show that with high point proportions ranging from 5 to 15%, this new metric can clearly distinguish the strongly substrate-controlled example in experiment 1 with the more laterally-expansive and potentially self-organized examples in experiments 2\u20134 (Fig. 12). However, the transitional nature of experiment 2 is more apparent when more than 15% of the highest points are selected, so we used a default of 20% in the four experiments.\n\n\n4.3\nEvolution of surface roughness and irregularity\nMicrobialite growth is a dynamics process of mat accretion alternating with periods of sediment deposition from suspension (Grotzinger and Knoll, 1999). Growth on microbial mats tends to produce an irregular, rough surface but settling of sediment out of suspension tends to fill in local depressions and effectively smooths the surface. One might expect the various interactions of these two processes to generate varying degrees of surface roughness and irregularity, and this is investigated here using Stromatobyte3D.\nSurface roughness can be measured as the deviation of the height of individual surface point from the mean surface height, following the definition by Barab\u00e1si and Stanley (1995);\n\n\nw\n\nL\nt\n\n=\n\n\n1\nL\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nL\n\n\n\n\nh\n\ni\nt\n\n\u2212\n\nh\n\u00af\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nwhere L is the total number of points, h is the height for any point on this surface, t is time step, i is an index number, and \n\nh\n\u00af\n\n is the mean surface height. An \u2018in-situ growth-dominated\u2019 system with a higher volume percentage of microbialite will generally have rougher surfaces, so experiment 3 has the highest roughness (Fig. 13\n). In contrast, a \u2018sedimentation from suspension-dominated\u2019 system like experiment 2 has the lowest roughness. Surface roughness in experiment 1 increases very slowly after 160\u202fyears, because localised growth on initial topographic highs cannot be sustained, so sedimentation from suspension gradually dominates and smooths the surface (Figs. 11 & 13). Surface roughness evolution in experiment 4 is almost identical to experiment 3, suggesting better developed ridges and runnels due to more lateral amalgamation can maintain surface roughness even when stromatolite volume is reduced.\nMany modern microbialites are associated with elevated polygonal structures (Coshell et al., 1998; Bouton et al., 2016), or vegetation (Gallois et al., 2018), because an irregular and wavy surface has a higher \u2018seeding potential\u2019 and therefore facilitate microbialite growth. Surface irregularity is calculated as the percentage of bump points on the modelled topographic surface at every time step, following the definition by Leach (2014). A point will be considered \u2018bumpy\u2019 when the average height differences between this point and four adjacent points is above a threshold value, in this case 0.03\u202fm. Evolution of surface irregularity in the four experiments (Fig. 14\n) are very different from the previous surface roughness plot. Isolated mounds give experiment 1 the highest irregularity with an increasing trend through time, associated with a transition from mound aggradation to retrogradation as growth rate decreases (Fig. 11). Surfaces are most regular in experiment 4 with little fluctuation, in contrasting to their surface roughness which is highest of the four experiments (Fig. 13). This contrast reflects the development of \u2018ridge and runnel\u2019 patterns. Ridge crests elevate faster than the mean surface elevation increases, so surface roughness increases. Conversely, these ridges are spatially extensive with flat tops, so their growth reduces surface irregularity. Ridges are not developed in experiment 2, but the smoothing effect due to high sedimentation from suspension helps to maintain surface regularity (see Table 3). Quantifying surface characteristics and evolution is complicated because surface geometry tends to be complicated, but by coupling two quantitative metrics here, these results show how the dynamics of microbial mound morphology are controlled by interactions of opposing depositional processes.\n\n\n4.4\nConnectivity\nMicrobialite strata can be important reservoirs for hydrocarbons, stored CO2, or other fluids, so it would be useful to characterise and understand their connectivity, and their connectivity could also perhaps be another metric to distinguish self-organized examples. A simple algorithm is developed to quickly calculate 2D connectivity from a map-view surface in the end of model run. For each cell on the final surface occupied by microbialite, adjacent cells also occupied by microbialite are counted as connected. Both diagonally and orthogonally adjacent cells are counted. The sum of this count is divided by the total number of grid cells to yield an estimate of gross planform connectivity (Fig. 15\n). Increasing gross connectivity is observed from experiments 1 to 4, consistent with their large-scale morphologies. This suggests that stronger spatial feedbacks between depositional system components will lead to mound coalescence and in turn enhance connectivity in microbialite strata, with potentially very significant implications for understanding subsurface reservoir connectivity.\n\n\n\n5\nControl by an organized substrate\nThe nature of the substrate is considered as an important control on microbialite nucleation and growth. Stromatolite growth usually requires a stable and rocky substrate rather than soft mud or mobile ooidal sand (Logan et al., 1974; Andres and Reid, 2006; Ginsburg and Planavsky, 2008; Della Porta, 2015). In Shark Bay, stromatolites are generally better developed around headlands where local Pleistocene beach ridges and Miocene quartzite outcrops form suitable indurate substrates (Playford et al., 2013). Experiments 1 to 4 demonstrate how self-organization creates ordered morphology and strata from a disordered initial topography, but an outstanding question is what patterns will be produced if the substrate itself is highly organized with regular morphological features? In order to address this question, a new initial surface is used with several evenly-spaced linear ridges, each with relief up to 0.5\u202fm, representing antecedent beach ridges as observed in Shark Bay (Fig. 16\n). Two additional experiments are conducted, equivalent to experiments 1 and 4 except for the different initial surface. These two experiments are referred to as experiments 1b and 4b.\nMicrobialite occurrence is strongly controlled by the underlying substrate in experiment 1b (Fig. 17\n), where growth is limited to initial substrate highs (Table 4\n). Rapid sedimentation from suspension inhibits growth in the remaining area where topography is flat. Consequently, both microbialite volume percentage and areal coverage reduce dramatically compared to experiment 1 (Table 4). In cross section, there is a trend from aggradation to retrogradation, as stromatolite columns are gradually buried by adjacent packstone. Parallel to the flow direction, substrate highs are wider, stromatolites grow over the entire ridges initially, then split into columns as they grow vertically, developing compound morphologies. The area directly above the top of initial surface highs is not as steep as the flanks so sedimentation from suspension will be faster though time, and eventually creates a topographic saddle (Fig. 17).\nThe substrate control is still very strong in experiment 4b, but to a lesser degree compared to experiment 1b (Table 4). A major difference in this case is the increasingly closer spatial feedbacks that facilitate rapid sediment trapping and lateral growth, so mounds can expand and prograde in the flow direction (Fig. 17). Consequently, mounds extend further than the initial topographic highs. Many relatively small mounds are nucleating on the windward side, which can potentially interact and be amalgamated with existing large mounds. Compared to experiment 4, microbialite volume, areal coverage, and connectivity in experiment 4b are much lower due to stronger dependence of substrate. This experiment might represent a hybrid and transitional case, similar to the Spaven Province and Hutchison Province in Shark Bay, where individual stromatolite growth can respond to local hydrodynamic conditions with direction of elongation parallel to flow direction, and their large-scale nested distribution is primarily controlled by the underlying Pleistocene beach ridges (Playford et al., 2013; Suosaari et al., 2016).\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nThe concept of self-organization and how it works comes originally from the classic \u2018reaction-diffusion\u2019 model (Turing, 1952). In his model, local feedbacks occur between reaction components, but spatial information is also transmitted over a longer distance via diffusion. Formation of stable patterns requires the diffusion rate of inhibitor to be faster than the activator. Since both the Turing model and Stromatobyte3D generate patterns through self-organization, it is useful to compare both models. Microbialite growth occurs locally as the activator, inhibited over longer distances by the background packstone deposition from suspension. In experiment 4, in-situ growth and sedimentation from suspension both control and are controlled by topographic evolution and associated flow magnitude. As a result, patterns in Stromatobyte3D emerge due to the interaction of topography, hydrodynamics, and two types of sedimentation, with positive feedback dominating at short scale and negative feedback dominating at the larger scale, so very similar overall to the original activator-inhibitor model from Turing (1952).\nBased on detailed field observations from Highborne Cay in Bahamas, Andres and Reid (2006) recognised two distinct stromatolite morphologies. Columnar stromatolites occur as isolated or coalesced mounds, without a preferred orientation with respect to the shoreline or incoming waves. Stromatolite ridges preferentially occur in shallower back-reef areas, with long axes parallel to the incoming waves. These observations are consistent with results from experiments 1 and 4. Andres and Reid (2006) attribute observed stromatolite occurrence and morphology to differences in rate of accommodation creation, sedimentation patterns, and hydrodynamics. Very similar controls operate in Stromatobyte3D and generate comparable microbialite morphologies within a continuum between columnar forms and ridge-dominated forms. Lateral coalescence is suppressed in the domal end member (experiment 1) due to prominent substrate control that overprinted the hydrodynamic component. As a result, microbialites are gradually buried or smothered by suspended sediment and can't keep up with rising water level. In contrast, when hydrodynamics have strong influence on both growth and sedimentation patterns (experiment 4), in-situ growth is optimised to catch up the water level, and lateral growth is facilitated to trigger lateral mound coalescence to form elongated morphologies. It is the \u2018dual-control\u2019 of accommodation and accretion rate that determine the potential of lateral coalescence, which in turn controls macroscopic mound morphology. In many marine and non-marine microbialites, the frequency of relative water depth changes and duration of subaerial exposure would likely to determine the degree of connections and feedbacks between microbe-dominated ecosystem components, water, and sediment relative to the control by substrate.\nIf spatial self-organization forms stromatolite ridges in Stromatobyte3D, why do we not see many well-developed ridges or other coherent patterns preserved in ancient strata? Based on these model results, we suspect there are four key reasons. Firstly, ridge formation requires a somewhat complex set of interactions between several processes, so if any of the processes are absent or too weak, or some environmental changes occurred, the fine balance will be changed and ridges will not form. For example, modern stromatolites ridges are found in high-energy water at Promontory Point, Great Salt Lake, separated by channels filled with ooidal sands. In contrast, individual rounded stromatolites are developed on stable substrate in the nearby but more protected Bridger Bay area (Della Porta, 2015; Baskin et al., 2021). Secondly, even if the necessary processes are operating, other processes and factors, currently not considered in this model, may also impact and usually complicate stratigraphic development. For example, erosion is an important process for sculpting microbialites by limiting mound growth, removing accreted microbial deposits, and initiating new phases of microbialite development (Bosak et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2021). Elongated microbialite ridges are interpreted to be a result of wave scour of inter-mound space to prevent mat growth, whereas the adjacent elevated areas are colonised and stabilised by organisms with reduced scour (Logan et al., 1974; Bosak et al., 2013; Playford et al., 2013). Increasing wave scour and abrasion under strong directional flows tends to increase mound relief and produce isolated mounds with regular and smooth edges (Bosak et al., 2013). In contrast, weaker flows and limited scour allow growth to occur in the inter-mound space, causing more irregular mound edges and formation of inter-mound bridge for incipient coalescence. This interpretation is very different from our modelling results, but also important to consider, especially if there is clear evidence of removal of underlying sediment. Faulting, not modelled here, and related sediment disturbance can also be an important factor on microbialite development and distribution on a much larger scale (Andrews and Trewin, 2014; Baskin et al., 2021). Thirdly, the long-term evolution of microbial community can be part of the reason. In fact, agglutinated textures are rare in fossil microbialites, until the relatively recent introduction of diatoms, chlorophytes, and other small algae that significantly increase the mat ability to trap more and coarser sediment, and to resist against erosion (Riding, 2000). Agglutinated microbialites are only well-developed under some specific environmental conditions, which are not easy to achieve (Suarez-Gonzalez et al., 2019), and an even smaller subset of the possible combination of these conditions can generate microbialite ridges. Finally, it may also be that because of the limited nature of exposure, it is often difficult to accurately assess the three-dimensional geometry of stromatolites in some outcrops. Better understanding of how ridge stromatolite structures can form might aid their recognition in outcrop.\nAs ever, the best approach to any interpretation of ancient strata is likely to be to adopt multiple hypotheses to explain observed morphologies, and then seek further evidence, for example from further outcrop analysis combined with numerical forward modelling, to try to reject or support hypotheses according to this evidence. Following this logic, future work is required to include erosion and other sediment redistributing processes in Stromatobyte3D, and more generally to integrate field-based conceptual models with numerical models to better understand which basic physical, biological, and chemical processes are required to produce specific morphologies, how they interact, and over what spatial and temporal scales.\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nResults from this modelling study suggest several significant conclusions:\n\n1.\nWith increasingly strong influence of hydrodynamics on in-situ growth and suspended sediment deposition, three distinct microbialite morphologies are produced in the model, from isolated columns in experiment 1, through longitudinal mounds in experiment 2, to ridges and runnels in experiments 3 and 4, the latter with significantly improved connectivity and anisotropy following the dominant flow direction.\n\n\n2.\nModelled macro-scale microbialite morphologies and distributions are strikingly similar to observations from modern Shark Bay, suggesting modelled processes and their behaviours are realistic, and can therefore be useful explaining how ancient microbialite strata formed.\n\n\n3.\nSpatial self-organization can occur in microbialites, similar to coral reefs, in a shallow-water environment affected by shoreline processes with strong wave or current influence, due to interactions between substrate topography, in-situ growth, sedimentation from suspension, and hydrodynamics.\n\n\n4.\nQuantitative analysis of mound distribution in map view shows that modelled stromatolite mounds can self-organize to form coherent morphological patterns, independent of initial substrate topography.\n\n\n5.\nWhen the underlying substrate is highly organized with regular morphological features, it may be the dominant control on large scale microbialite occurrence, but self-organizing autogenic dynamics can still impact on individual microbialite growth helping to form and maintain patterns such as elongated morphology parallel to flow direction beyond what would occur simply from the initial substrate control.\n\n\n\n\n","69":"","70":"","71":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe origin of sharp-based coarse-grained sedimentary bodies isolated in fine-grained dominated offshore\/shelf settings has been a matter of debate for the sedimentary community (see Snedden and Bergman, 1999; Suter and Clifton, 1999). Some studies originally interpreted them as incised valley fills or regressive shallow-marine deposits, transported onto and across the shelf during periods of abrupt lowering of relative sea level (e.g., Plint, 1988; Van Wagoner, 1991; Posamentier and Chamberlain, 1993; Bergman and Walker, 1995, 1999; Burton and Walker, 1999; MacEachern et al., 1999). Alternatively, another mechanism involves the reworking of regressive deposits by shelf processes during transgressions. This can result in the development of shelf ridges, which are relatively large-scale (several m-high, hundreds of m-wide, few km long) elongate geomorphic elements observed in a wide range of either tide-, wave- or storm-dominated modern (e.g., Houbolt, 1968; Swift, 1975; Kenyon et al., 1981; Swift and Field, 1981; Stride, 1982; McBride and Moslow, 1991; Johnson and Baldwin, 1996; van de Meene et al., 1996; Bern\u00e9 et al., 1998; Snedden and Dalrymple, 1999; Dyer and Huntley, 1999; Jin and Chough, 2002; Snedden et al., 2011) and ancient shelves (e.g. Posamentier, 2002; Olariu et al., 2012; Schwarz, 2012; Messina et al., 2014; Leva-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016; Longhitano et al., 2021). Shelf ridge deposits are commonly well sorted, relatively texturally and mineralogically mature, and with extensive and well-preserved overlying and interstratified fine-grained successions, which give them potential to form good reservoirs (e.g., Posamentier, 2002; Cattaneo and Steel, 2003; Chiarella et al., 2020).\nIn the past few years, there has been a renewed interest in shelf ridges, with several studies that have refined previous depositional models (e.g., Snedden et al., 2011; Desjardins et al., 2012; Olariu et al., 2012; Schwarz, 2012; Messina et al., 2014; Leva-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016; Michaud and Dalrymple, 2016; Leszczynski and Nemec, 2019; Chiarella et al., 2020). However, most of these studies are from siliciclastic-dominated systems, and there is a relative lack of studies in mixed (carbonate\u2013siliciclastic) successions, with a few exceptions of similar deposits described in ancient straits or seaways (e.g., Longhitano et al., 2012, 2014, 2021; Rossi et al., 2017). In addition, in mixed shallow-marine settings, the carbonate factory is not necessarily located close to the coeval shoreline systems supplying the siliciclastic fraction (see Schwarz et al., 2018), which can make the correct identification of isolated shelf sedimentary bodies and their interpretation in terms of sequence stratigraphic concepts more complex.\nIn this study, an outcrop example from the Upper Miocene of northern Guadix Basin (Spain) is presented, with the aim to (i) characterize and discuss the origin of sharp-based mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic deposits in a shallow-marine succession, (ii) propose a depositional and sequence stratigraphic model for their development in an active tectonic setting, and (iii) provide criteria to adequately differentiate them from their regressive counterparts.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Betic Cordillera represents the northern branch of the arcuate Betic-Rif Alpine orogen that closes the westernmost Mediterranean Basin (Alboran Basin) across the Gibraltar Arc (Fig. 1\n). At the beginning of the Neogene, three major tectono-palaeogeographic domains formed and delimited the Betic Cordillera: (1) a fold-and-thrust belt (External Zones or South Iberian Palaeomargin), (2) a thrust stack of metamorphic nappe complexes (Internal Zones or Alboran Domain), and (3) allochthonous deposits (Flysch or Gibraltar Units) (Balany\u00e1 and Garc\u00eda-Due\u00f1as, 1987). Westward displacement of the Internal Zones configured two major N\u2013S arcuate thrust systems (Gibraltar and Cazorla Arcs) connected by E\u2013W transfer fault zones (P\u00e9rez-Valera et al., 2017). This structural configuration controlled the creation of high-subsidence depocentres during the Atlantic\u2013Mediterranean connection through the Betic corridor (Mart\u00edn et al., 2009; H\u00fcsing et al., 2010; Reolid et al., 2012). One of these depocentres is found in the Guadix Basin, at the central sector of the Betic Cordillera, which preserves a few hundred-m thick Tortonian marine succession (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 1996; Soria et al., 1999).\nThe study area is located in the northern part of the Guadix Basin (Fig. 1). Here the sedimentary infill covers the period from the Tortonian to the Quaternary and is composed of six depositional sequences (referred to as Units I\u2013VI, after Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 1996, Fig. 1C), separated by regional unconformities or correlative conformities representing major tectonic and\/or eustatic events (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 1996; Soria et al., 1999; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2009). This study is focused on the lowermost part of the succession, with more than 1\u202fkm-thick Tortonian marine deposits forming the first three depositional sequences, which are (from base to top): Unit I, the objective of this study, formed by offshore to nearshore silty marlstones, sandstones, calcarenites and conglomerates, and defined by Neogloboquadrina acostaensis to N. humerosa planktonic foraminifera subzones (Soria, 1993); Unit II, dominated by offshore marine marlstones interbedded with occasional dm-thick sandstones, and defined by Globorotalia suterae planktonic foraminifera subzone; and Unit III, represented by nearshore cross-stratified mixed siliciclastic\u2013carbonate deposits and large-scale cross-bedded conglomerates (Soria, 1993; Soria et al., 2003; Reolid et al., 2012).\nThe succession crops out in a regional monoclinal structure with strata consistently dipping to the S\u2013SW (Fig. 1). This overall disposition is altered by local syn- and post-depositional faults and associated internal angular unconformities, although these are not necessarily associated with major facies changes. The strata also show an abrupt onlap termination against a highly-tilted lower Miocene algal limestone unit on top of the basement, formed by Mesozoic rocks from the External Zone (Soria, 1993; P\u00e9rez-Valera et al., 2017) (Fig. 2\n).\n\n\n3\nDataset and methods\nThis study is based on the detailed analysis of a 304\u202fm-thick outcrop stratigraphic section (Fig. 3\n), which was measured at cm-scale. Field data were obtained using conventional methodology of logging and describing sedimentary rocks, collecting information about lithology (texture and composition), sedimentary structures, ichnological features and composition, bioturbation index (BI of Taylor and Goldring, 1993), orientation of palaeocurrent indicators, scale and geometry of both stratification and sedimentary bodies, types of contacts and sample collection (n\u202f=\u202f7) for thin section and hand-specimen analysis for each type of deposit. Once measured, the succession was characterized by defining sedimentary facies associations and vertical stratigraphic trends.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nFacies analysis\nThe succession shows a recurrent alternation of coarse and fine-grained mixed carbonate\/siliciclastic deposits (Fig. 3), with dominantly silty marlstones and marly sandstones alternating with m-scale, sharp-based and laterally-continuous mixed siliciclastic\u2013carbonate medium to coarse-grained packages. A detailed facies analysis has allowed the definition of 7 facies associations (FA 1\u20137), which are described below and summarized in Table 1\n.\n\n\n4.2\nGrey structureless marlstones (FA1-offshore)\nThis facies association is composed of whitish grey, structureless to faintly laminated marlstones (Fig. 4A, B). Despite the lack of structures, subtle grain-size changes occur within mm-scale beds, and bedding contacts are roughly parallel where visible. Thin section analysis reveals that these deposits are dominated by quartz grains and planktonic foraminifera, floating inside the muddy matrix that occupies more than 15% of the rock (Fig. 5A). Other studies have also described sponge spicules and radiolarian in the same deposits (Soria, 1993). Beds are mm to cm-thick, but packages can reach several metres in thickness (Fig. 6\n). Large accumulations of well-preserved bivalves are locally observed in these deposits in the lower part of the section. Bioturbation is absent to low (BI 0\u20132). Regional mapping reveals that they form laterally extensive units, which can be followed for several km (Figs. 2, 3). Scattered thin-bedded (up to 10\u202fcm-thick), normally-graded muddy sandstone beds are observed within the mudstone successions, some with erosive bases and rippled tops, and up to moderately bioturbated (BI 0\u20133).\n\n4.2.1\nInterpretation\nThe dominant fine-grained nature of these deposits, combined with the microfossil content (mainly planktonic foraminifera) and relatively low bioturbation index, suggests that they accumulated in a relatively distal depositional setting, below storm wave base, with dominant low-energy processes such as hemipelagic suspension settling (Birgenheier et al., 2017). Minor presence of normally-graded sandstone thin beds suggests that this offshore setting received occasional coarse-grained siliciclastic supply via low-density turbidity currents (e.g., hyperpycnal flows) (Bhattacharya and MacEachern, 2009; Harazim and McIlroy, 2015).\n\n\n\n4.3\nHeterolithic sandstone\/marlstone packages (FA2 - offshore transition)\nThis facies association is composed of grey laminated sandy marlstones and sandstone\/marlstone heterolithic packages, interbedded with 5 to 40\u202fcm-thick isolated fine to coarse-grained sandstone beds (Fig. 4D). These beds are tabular or lens shaped, with erosive and\/or deformed bases (e.g., load casts), normal grading and rippled tops, hummocky-cross stratification and common soft-sediment deformation (Fig. 4C, E). Naked-eye analysis of sandstone beds reveals abundant extraclasts (mainly quartz), organic matter and bioclasts. Thin section analysis confirms that they are dominated by quartz grains, with minor metamorphic rock fragments and planktonic and benthic foraminifera (Fig. 5B). Tool marks (mainly flutes) and foresets show palaeocurrents ranging to the SW\u2013NW (Fig. 6). Sandstone beds can be up to moderately bioturbated (BI 0\u20133), with vertical or horizontal traces at the top surface (Fig. 8A). Packages range from 8 to 40\u202fm in thickness (Fig. 6). The tops of these packages can be gradational to overlying lower shoreface deposits (FA3) or be abruptly truncated by transgressive deposits (FA4) (Fig. 6).\n\n4.3.1\nInterpretation\nThe heterolithic and coarser-grained character of these facies, together with the fossil content (planktonic and benthic foraminifera) and the common appearance of combined-flow structures suggests that these facies accumulated in an offshore transition setting, above storm-wave base (Dott and Bourgois, 1982; Duke, 1985; Duke et al., 1991; Dumas et al., 2005). Coarse-grained sands were transported by seaward low to high-density turbidity currents (e.g., hyperpycnal flows), and were partly reworked by storms (e.g., Myrow et al., 2002; Pattison et al., 2007; Lamb et al., 2008; Steel et al., 2018; Jelby et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n4.4\nWavy-laminated sandy mudstones to muddy sandstones (FA-3 - lower shoreface)\nThis facies association is composed of grey laminated sandy mudstones to muddy sandstones, with wavy bedding and symmetrical ripple cross-lamination (Fig. 4F, G), and isolated cm-thick beds with low-angle, hummocky and tangential\/sigmoidal cross stratification and soft sediment deformation. Palaeocurrents from cross-stratification foresets, where observed, point dominantly towards the S\u2013SE. Packages are 3 to 19\u202fm-thick, and tend to stack forming coarsening-up successions (Fig. 6). They generally display a gradational lower contact from underlying offshore transition deposits (FA2), and are conformably overlain by condensed deposits (FA7) or abruptly truncated by transgressive (FA4) or channel-fill (FA7) deposits (Fig. 6).\n\n4.4.1\nInterpretation\nThe sandy but fine-grained and thin-bedded nature of the deposits, common presence of wavy bedding and symmetrical ripples, and occasional appearance of thick sandstone beds with larger-scale combined-flow structures suggest that these deposits accumulated in a dominantly low-energy lower shoreface setting (Walker and Plint, 1992; Yang et al., 2005; Dumas and Arnott, 2006).\n\n\n\n4.5\nStructureless bioclastic calcarenites (FA4 - transgressive deposits)\nThis facies association is composed by yellow medium to very coarse-grained, structureless bioclastic calcarenites (Fig. 4H). Beds are 60 to 250\u202fcm-thick and moderately to highly bioturbated (BI 3\u20135) (Fig. 6). They have a prominent sharp, erosive highly bioturbated base, with vertical, sub-vertical and oblique J-shaped burrows and shallow cylindrical rounded structures, as well as circular sections and horizontal, branched, forms. Most traces can be assigned to Thalassinoides, but with local presence of Rhizocorallium, Skolithos and Bergaueria. Burrows are undeformed and characterized by sharp contacts, showing, in some cases a penetration depth up to around 20\u202fcm into the underlying deposits, and are passively infilled by mixed carbonate\u2013clastic sediment (Fig. 8B, C). This includes abundant skeletal fragments (dominantly from bivalves and bryozoans, and minor red algae and echinoids), organic matter, coal fragments and extraclasts (quartz and volcanic-rock fragments), in a relatively poorly-sorted organization. Normally-graded bed tops occur. These deposits can be laterally discontinuous, but they are commonly found abruptly truncating offshore transition (FA2) or lower shoreface (FA3) deposits, and overlain by mixed bar (FA5) or condensed (FA6) deposits (Figs. 6, 7\n).\n\n4.5.1\nInterpretation\nThe ichnological features found at the base of these deposits allow assignation to the Glossifungites ichnofacies, developed into compacted, semi-lithified substrates (Seilacher, 1967). This firmground ichnofacies has been used extensively in the identification of omission surfaces and the identification and interpretation of transgressive surfaces (MacEachern et al., 1992, 1999; Bann et al., 2004; Rodr\u00edguez-Tovar et al., 2007). The contacts are therefore interpreted as transgressive surfaces, although evidence is not conclusive to associate them to either wave or tidal ravinement processes (see Cattaneo and Steel, 2003). The poorly-sorted and bioclastic-rich deposits immediately overlying these surfaces are consequently interpreted as transgressive deposits (Zecchin et al., 2019), resulting from the remobilization of a coeval carbonate factory, mixed with the erosion of underlying offshore transition (FA2) and lower shoreface (FA3) deposits. However, the transgressive reworking of coarser-grained, forced-regressive sandstone wedges located farther seaward cannot be ruled out.\n\n\n\n4.6\nSigmoidal cross-bedded bioclastic calcarenites (FA5 - mixed bars)\nThis facies association is composed of yellow fine to coarse-grained, cross-bedded bioclastic calcarenites (Fig. 4I, J). Beds commonly have soft-sediment deformed bases, and are arranged in stacked dominantly single (locally multiple) sets of large-scale sigmoidal cross-bedding, forming up to 8\u202fm-thick barforms (Figs. 6, 7), with relatively sharp tops, occasionally highly cemented and concretionary. They have abundant skeletal fragments (dominantly from bivalves and bryozoans, and minor red algae and echinoids), benthic and planktonic foraminifera, glauconitic grains, organic matter, coal fragment debris and extraclasts (Fig. 4K). Thin section and hand-specimen analysis reveals the average grain composition is 70% clastic grains (30% quartz, 40% lithic fragments: metamorphic, volcanic and limestone-rock fragments), 10% bioclasts and 20% siliciclastic matrix (Fig. 5C\u2013F). Bars show bidirectional accretion directions ranging towards the S and N, although southward accretion dominates (Figs. 6, 7). Beds are moderately to highly bioturbated (BI 3\u20135), with traces including dominant Planolites, well-developed Thalassinoides structures, vertical Ophiomorpha shafts, and local Bichordites\/Scolicia (Fig. 8D\u2013F).\n\n4.6.1\nInterpretation\nThese deposits are interpreted as mixed siliciclastic\u2013carbonate barforms, resulting from the reworking of a coeval carbonate factory, together with the underlying offshore transition (FA2) and lower shoreface (FA3), but also transgressive deposits (FA4), accumulated preferentially in some areas of the seabed (as suggested by their lateral discontinuity), favouring a higher reworking by shelf currents.\n\n\n\n4.7\nHighly bioturbated, concretionary sandstones (FA6 - condensed deposits)\nThis facies association is composed by grey\u2013yellow, intensely bioturbated sandstones (BI 5\u20136; Fig. 8G), with bioclasts accumulations (mainly bivalve fragments), occasional glauconitic grains, and often highly cemented or forming concretionary horizons (Fig. 4N, O). Traces include Scolicia showing cross-cutting relationships to bed top surfaces (Fig. 8G). Beds are generally thin (up to 20\u202fcm), but packages reach up to 1.5\u202fm in thickness. They are often found conformably overlying lower shoreface deposits (FA3) or mixed bars (FA5), and overlain by offshore (FA1) or offshore transition (FA2) fine-grained deposits (Fig. 6).\n\n4.7.1\nInterpretation\nThe high bioturbation index of these deposits, with multiple generation of traces, together with the presence of bioclast accumulations and glauconitic grains and their concretionary\/cemented nature is consistent with condensed deposits; these represent a considerable span of time recorded by only relatively thin layers, and form under low energy, low sedimentation rate conditions, associated with increased water depth during regional flooding events (Loutit et al., 1988).\n\n\n\n4.8\nErosive-based, bioclastic pebbly sandstones (FA7 - channel-fill)\nThis facies association is composed of bioclastic, cross-bedded pebbly sandstones, contained in a concave-up erosive base, cutting several cm into the underlying deposits, and forming a 5\u202fm-thick package (Fig. 4L). The package is slightly fining-up, and contains a mix of skeletal fragments (dominantly bivalves, but also bryozoans and red algae), organic matter and large (up to several cm-long) angular extraclasts (quartz and volcanic fragments), more concentrated towards the base (Fig. 4M). This facies association is only recognized in the upper part of the studied section, abruptly truncating lower shoreface deposits (FA3), and overlain by mixed bars (FA5) (Fig. 6).\n\n4.8.1\nInterpretation\nThe highly erosive, concave-up basal surface, together with the coarser nature and larger presence of landward material, mixed with reworked skeletal fragments, is consistent with these deposits being interpreted as subaqueous channel fills (Fig. 6).\n\n\n\n\n5\nStratigraphic arrangement\nThe studied succession is summarized in Fig. 6. The succession shows an alternation of coarse and fine-grained mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic deposits, which can be subdivided in at least 8 progradational\u2013retrogradational cycles (C1\u2013C8), each of them 23 to 45\u202fm-thick (Figs. 3, 5). Cycles start with either dominantly structureless to faintly laminated marlstones, with occasional thin-bedded sandstones, some with erosive bases and rippled tops (FA1 \u2013 offshore, Table 1, Fig. 4A), or with an alternation of laminated sandy marlstones and medium-bedded sandstones, with hummocky-cross stratification and common soft-sediment deformation (FA2 \u2013 offshore transition, Table 1, Fig. 4C, D). In some cycles (C1\u20133 and C7\u20138, Fig. 6), these are progressively replaced by coarsening-up packages of sandy mudstones to muddy sandstones, with wavy bedding and symmetrical ripple cross-lamination (FA3 \u2013 lower shoreface, Table 1, Fig. 4E). This progradational stacking culminates in some cycles (C1\u20132, Fig. 6) with thin, intensely bioturbated sandstones (FA6 \u2013 condensed deposits, Table 1, Fig. 4N). In other cycles (C3\u20138, Fig. 6), it is abruptly truncated by erosive contacts bioturbated by large, sharp-walled burrows, passively infilled by overlying mixed carbonate\u2013clastic sediments (FA4 \u2013 transgressive deposits, Table 1, Fig. 4H), or in just one occasion by concave-up erosive surfaces, filled with bioclastic cross-bedded pebbly sandstones (FA6 \u2013 channel fill, Table 1, Fig. 4L, M) (Fig. 6). These deposits are overlain by poorly- to moderately-sorted mixed carbonate\u2013clastic units, rich in skeletal fragments and extraclasts (mainly quartz and volcanic fragments), and displaying large-scale sigmoidal cross bedding (FA5 \u2013 mixed bars, Table 1, Fig. 4I\u2013K). They show a fining- and thinning-up arrangement, often capped by highly-cemented and concretionary bioturbated sandstones, with high ichnodiversity (FA6 \u2013 condensed deposits, Table 1, Fig. 4N), interpreted as containing maximum flooding surfaces.\n\n\n6\nDepositional model\nThe studied succession is interpreted to have deposited in a relatively shallow-water shelf (Fig. 9\n), around the storm-wave base, as suggested by the relative dominance of offshore transition deposits (FA2) with combined-flow structures (i.e., hummocky cross stratification) (Fig. 6). The fine-grained nature of the coarsening and thickening up successions of offshore (FA1), offshore transition (FA2) to lower shoreface (FA3) deposits (Fig. 6) suggests that there was a relatively distal coeval west- to north-westward prograding shoreline system (Fig. 10a). This shelf was only receiving occasional coarse-grained siliciclastic sediment supply (and organic debris) via forced regressions and\/or seaward gravity flows (e.g. hyperpycnal flows), which underwent storm reworking during or shortly after deposition, and resulted in discrete cm-thick sandstone beds within offshore transition deposits (Fig. 10b). After enough time to create a firm or compacted substrate, offshore transition to lower shoreface deposits were partially eroded during transgression, with the development of erosive and highly bioturbated ravinement surfaces (Fig. 10c), as suggested by the undeformed and sharp nature of the burrows (Fig. 8B, C) and their association to Glossifungites ichnofacies. These ravinement surfaces were followed by deposition of a relatively poorly-sorted assemblage of mixed deposits (FA4), dominated by skeletal fragments resulting from the remobilization of a coeval carbonate factory (Fig. 10d). The uneven accumulation of these mixed deposits on the seabed possibly resulted in areas that favoured higher reworking via shelf (most likely storm-wave) processes and nucleation of laterally extensive shelf ridges, with the development of sigmoidal cross-bedded barforms (FA5) (Fig. 10e). These show bidirectional accretion orientations (N\u2013S), but dominantly pointing southward, at a high angle with respect to the dominantly west- to north-westward orientation of unidirectional palaeocurrents recorded from offshore-transition deposits (Fig. 9B). Continued transgression resulted in regional flooding, increased water depth and a decrease of reworking processes and deposition, leading to lower sedimentation rates and the development of highly biortubated, condensed deposits (FA7), containing maximum flooding surfaces (Fig. 10f). Finally, the next phase of advancement of the regressive shoreline system led to progressive deposition of fine-grained sediments in offshore and offshore-transition settings, resulting in the burial and effective preservation of the underlying mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic shelf ridges (Fig. 10g).\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nA fine-grained siliciclastic shelf and the origin of the remobilized carbonate factory\nIn the studied succession, the fine-grained, siliciclastic dominated offshore to lower shoreface deposits (FA1\u2013FA3, Table 1) are abruptly truncated by mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic units, through sharp, highly bioturbated transgressive ravinement surfaces. These mixed deposits are remarkably different from the underlying shelf deposits, with coarse-grained, bioclastic calcarenites (FA4, FA5, Table 1) with skeletal fragments. Because these skeletal fragments are only recognized in the mixed clastic\u2013carbonate units (see Fig. 5), this implies the presence of a coeval carbonate factory, located in either (i) a more distal position or (ii) a lateral position within the shelf. The occurrence of a bryomol-type skeletal association in the mixed deposits (mainly bryozoans and bivalves, and minor red algae and echinoids), would indicate non-tropical, temperate-type shallow-water conditions (Betzler et al., 1997). Because of the relative dominance of siliciclastic material of the studied mixed deposits it is not possible to reconstruct a biofacies belt model as described in other shallow-marine examples richer in carbonate skeletal-grains (e.g., late Miocene ramp of Menorca, Spain, Pomar et al., 2012). However, bryozoan\u2013mollusc\u2013echinoid associations have been reported as dominant in carbonate factories located at the proximal sector of the outer ramp (Brandano and Corda, 2002). This biota association is therefore characteristic of deeper depositional environments (i.e., aphotic zone in outer-middle ramp, Brandano and Corda, 2002) compared to other skeletal associations, like branching red algae-dominant (i.e., oligophotic zone - middle ramp) identified in other time-equivalent successions in the nearby Tabernas Basin (Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2006b). This is therefore considered to favour the interpretation that the coeval carbonate factory supplying the skeletal fragments was located farther offshore, and remobilized during transgressions. The scenario where the carbonate factory is located in more distal positions relative to the equivalent shoreline supplying the siliciclastic fraction can occur quite commonly in mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic shallow-marine systems (Schwarz et al., 2018; see also Reijmer, 2021).\n\n\n7.2\nPoorly-sorted versus well-sorted shelf ridges\nSeveral of the mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic deposits in the studied section are relatively poorly sorted and contain abundant extraclasts (mainly quartz and lithic fragments) and terrestrial organic matter fragments (Fig. 5). This contrasts with conventional transgressive shelf ridges, mostly composed of well-sorted sandstones (Cattaneo and Steel, 2003), particularly those undergoing long-term reworking\/remoulding during their migration along the shelf (Snedden and Dalrymple, 1999). The absence of an efficient segregation of heterolithic grains in the studied mixed shelf ridges is consistent with high-energy conditions induced by persistent storm-wave action. This is more characteristic around the shoreface zone than in more distal offshore settings (van Heteren et al., 2011; Rossi et al., 2017), where tidally-modulated segregation commonly occurs (Chiarella et al., 2012). The textural nature of the studied shelf ridges, more poorly-sorted and coarser-grained than conventional tidal-dominated offshore ridges, would therefore suggest that they developed around the shoreface zone, where sediment reworking by storm waves was common. The abundant extrabasinal detrital material derived from the high-energy storm reworking of (i) forced-regressive coarse-grained sandstones and (ii) sediment gravity-flow deposits, as extraclasts and terrestrial organic debris is commonly observed in sandstone beds within lower shoreface and offshore transition deposits (Fig. 5B). Additionally, well-developed burrowed ravinement basal surfaces and relatively short ridges (with single cross-bedding sets, and not forming compound bars) are more characteristic of gentle slopes and shallower-water settings (i.e., shoreface) (Nnafie et al., 2014).\nSimulations of sand ridges with morphodynamic models conclude that the morphology and activity of sand ridges are controlled by the rate of sea-level rise, depth and coastal-shelf slope (Nnafie et al., 2014). Following those models, the shelf ridges studied here, with more common examples of single than compound barforms, would have been enhanced during low rates of sea-level rise on gentle coastal to inner shelf slopes. Marine transgressions represent common scenarios for the development of mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic shelves (Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2006b; Fontana et al., 2015; Salocchi et al., 2017), where the interplay of high-energy currents removing carbonate factories and coming from detrital input drowning emerged areas encourages the mixing of carbonate and siliciclastic grains (Longhitano et al., 2014).\n\n\n7.3\nImplications for other studies of sharp-based shallow-marine deposits\nThe sharp bases of the mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic deposits studied here, assigned to the Glossifungites ichnofacies, have been associated with compacted, semi-lithified substrates, and interpreted as transgressive surfaces in other studies (Seilacher, 1967; MacEachern et al., 1992, 1999; Bann et al., 2004; Rodr\u00edguez-Tovar et al., 2007). This, combined with the presence of skeletal fragments from an offshore carbonate factory, significantly different from the underlying offshore transition to lower shoreface siliciclastic deposits, and the fining, thinning-up stacking of the deposits is consistent with these mixed units being interpreted as transgressive deposits (Fig. 9C). Several studies have proposed the sharp-based coarser-grained nature of some isolated shallow-marine deposits as criteria to interpret them as incised-valley fills or forced-regression sandstone wedges, associated with abrupt lowerings of relative sea-level (e.g. Hunt and Tucker, 1992; Ainsworth et al., 2000; Fitzsimmons and Johnson, 2000; Posamentier and Morris, 2000; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2011). These studies document significant grain-size breaks across sharp boundaries, but do not focus on significant compositional changes across major contacts. Therefore, our study emphasizes the importance of a careful analysis of the geometry and ichnology of sharp basal contacts in shallow-marine deposits, but also potential differential composition across their boundaries, and their stacking pattern, as key criteria to differentiate transgressive sharp-based mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic deposits from their regressive counterparts. Adequately determining the correct depositional model for the development of sharp-based, shallow-marine deposits detached from their coeval coastline and encased in marine mudstones is critical as different interpretations may imply significant differences in their predicted reservoir performance (Snedden and Bergman, 1999; Cattaneo and Steel, 2003).\n\n\n7.4\nThe influence of basin configuration in the upper Tortonian of the Betic Corridor\nOne of the most characteristic features of the studied succession is the repetition of offshore\/shoreface siliciclastic- and shelf mixed-lithofacies into 8 cycles (C1\u20138, see Fig. 6). The consistency of the oscillation between similar depositional environments throughout the section suggests similar water depths and hydrodynamic regime persisted through time. A balanced accommodation\/sediment supply ratio, with constant sediment supply and tectonic subsidence creating continuous accommodation space, would explain the preservation of such a thick, aggradational succession. However, other studies in relatively time-equivalent deposits in the southern margin of the Guadix Basin and in the northern margin of the Guadalquivir Foreland Basin have demonstrated the existence of coeval net regressive, siliciclastic-dominated shoreline systems (Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2006a, 2021). These studies evidence the existence of a complex and dynamic basin configuration in the upper Tortonian, with the development of local depocentres and relatively narrow corridors or seaways during the connection between the Mediterranean and Atlantic (Mart\u00edn et al., 2009; Reolid et al., 2012). This configuration resulted in intensification of bottom currents and favoured shelf reworking processes, as seen in this study and also in younger deposits (Betzler et al., 2006; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2009), and in the nearby Rifian corridor (Capella et al., 2017; de Weger et al., 2020; Beelen et al., 2021; Miguez-Salas et al., 2021). But it also promoted the development of local sediment entry points and variable stacking patterns, reflecting a differential interaction between active tectonics and sedimentation across the region (e.g., Andri\u0107 et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThis study analyses and discusses the origin and development of sharp-based, mixed carbonate\u2013siliciclastic shallow-marine deposits, with an outcrop example from the Upper Miocene of the Betic Cordillera (Spain). These mixed deposits abruptly truncate siliciclastic-dominated offshore to lower shoreface facies, via sharp, highly bioturbated contacts interpreted as transgressive ravinement surfaces, and form several m-thick and hundreds of m-long depositional elements, interpreted as mixed carbonate\u2013clastic shelf ridges. These ridges formed in a fine-grained shelf which received occasional coarse siliciclastic supply via sediment gravity flows, but with a coeval offshore carbonate factory, eroded and remobilized during transgressions. Similar sharp-based shallow-marine deposits could be tentatively misinterpreted as forced-regressive wedges in other studies. However, this work provides criteria to distinguish them, including the nature of their lower contact, presence of reworked offshore skeletal fragments and their stacking pattern, which are consistent with their interpretation as transgressive deposits. When put in context with other studies in relatively time-equivalent regressive and more siliciclastic-dominated successions nearby, this evidences a complex configuration of the Mediterranean\u2013Atlantic connection during the upper Miocene, with sea corridors increasing currents and shelf reworking processes, and local sediment supplies and depocentres resulting in laterally variable stacking patterns, and reflecting differential and complex tectono-sedimentary interactions.\n\n","72":"","73":"","74":"","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe fluvial-tidal transition zone (FTZ) constitutes a dynamic environment in which fluvial and tidal processes interact nonlinearly due to seasonal fluctuation in river discharge and tidal cycles (Dalrymple and Choi, 2007; Sassi and Hoitink, 2013; La Croix and Dashtgard, 2014; Hoitink and Jay, 2016; Hoitink et al., 2017; Gugliotta and Saito, 2019). Decoupling the relative dominance between fluvial and tidal processes is pivotal in understanding and predicting stratigraphic architecture formed in the FTZ (Dalrymple and Choi, 2007; Dalrymple et al., 2012, 2015; Shchepetkina et al., 2019). However, it is challenging to evaluate the relative dominance because tidal and fluvial processes tend to be cryptic in the landward and seaward ends of the FTZ, respectively (Dalrymple et al., 2015). Tide-modulated fluvial bedforms are suggested diagnostic of the landward end of the FTZ (van den Berg et al., 2007; Martinius and Gowland, 2011). In contrast, decrypting seasonal flood events from tidal deposits is ambiguous in the seaward end of the FTZ, where large tidal prism relative to fluvial discharge results in difficulties in differentiating ebb tidal currents from fluvially enhanced flows (e.g., Dalrymple and Choi, 2007; van den Berg et al., 2007; Gugliotta et al., 2016a, 2016b). No diagnostic criteria other than coarser-grained sediments related to river floods have been suggested for the seaward end of the FTZ (van den Berg et al., 2007; Dalrymple et al., 2012; Shchepetkina et al., 2016b).\nInshore tidal flats and saltmarshes in tide-influenced systems are commonly dissected by an extensive network of headward terminating and meandering blind tidal channels (Bridges and Leeder, 1976; Barwis, 1978; Ashley and Zeff, 1988; Wells et al., 1990; Allen and Duffy, 1998; Hood, 2006; Hughes, 2012). Although blind tidal channels develop by depositional processes in a deltaic setting (Hood, 2006, 2010), the meandering channels form mainly by erosional processes driven by tidal hydrodynamics (D'Alpaos et al., 2005; Kleinhans et al., 2009; Hughes, 2012; Belliard et al., 2015; Geng et al., 2020). Sedimentation in blind tidal channels is primarily dominated by tidal processes and influenced by local precipitation-induced fluvial discharge (Dalrymple et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2013; Choi and Jo, 2015; Kim et al., 2021). The stratigraphy of meandering blind tidal channel deposits is typically characterized by a fining-upward succession, representing the migration of point bars (Barwis, 1978; Roep, 1981; Stupples, 2002; Dalrymple, 2010; Tessier, 2012; Choi et al., 2013; Carling et al., 2015; Choi and Jo, 2015). In fact, blind tidal channels are considered to occur in the seaward or tide-dominated portion of the FTZ, serving as a basis for paleogeographic reconstruction in the rock record formed in the FTZ (Ghinassi et al., 2021). Fluvial controls on the stratigraphic architecture of blind tidal channel deposits remain largely unexplored.\nThe Sittaung River estuary in southcentral Myanmar has extensive tidal flats and saltmarshes incised by meandering dendritic blind tidal channels in the distal portion of the FTZ (Choi et al., 2020), where lots of sediments are supplied from both river and coastal zone (Ramaswamy et al., 2004; Rao et al., 2005; Anthony et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). The tidal flats and saltmarshes experienced geomorphic changes such as rapid erosion and progradation in response to the interaction between tidal and fluvial processes (Ahmed et al., 2019; Shimozono et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2020; Steijn et al., 2020), implying significant sediment transport occurred in channelized flow via the blind tidal channels. Yet the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the blind tidal deposits have not been well studied, and many remain undocumented. The present study aims to characterize the blind tidal channel deposits to unravel the relative interplay between tidal and fluvial processes in the distal part of the FTZ. We propose sedimentological and stratigraphic criteria diagnostic of fluvial processes in the tide-dominated estuary, and discuss the implications of our observations for existing facies models of tide-dominated estuaries, which are mostly associated with insignificant river discharge.\n\n\n2\nStudy area\nLocated in southcentral Myanmar, the Sittaung River runs southward along the valley confined by Pegu Range to the west and Shan Plateau to the east (Fig. 1\n). The Sittaung River empties into a funnel-shaped estuary with a wide entrance at the estuary mouth (Fig. 1). The meandering river transforms into a complex bar-channel system with extensive tidal flats and saltmarshes in the estuary. The morphology of the system has changed rapidly in response to tidal currents and river discharge over various temporal scales ranging from monthly to centennial (Shimozono et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2020). The channels in the estuary are typically very shallow and are prone to chute-cutoff and subsequent abandonment. Currently, the western bank of the estuary is bordered by cultivated saltmarshes and experiences notable cutbank erosion (Shimozono et al., 2019; Steijn et al., 2020). In contrast, the eastern bank is fringed by locally up to 15\u202fkm wide tidal flats and saltmarshes, which are highly dissected by sinuous fluvial-tidal channels and dendritic blind tidal channels (e.g., Hood, 2010). Saltmarshes are locally 3\u202fkm wide and are subject to reclamation by residents for cultivation.\nThe Sittaung River has an average annual discharge of 50\u202fkm3 or 1585 m3\/s, with nearly 70% concentrated during a wet season from May to October (de Vilder, 2015; van Rest, 2015; JICA, 2020). A monthly river discharge at Madauk, 160\u202fkm upstream from the Sittaung River mouth, increases rapidly from May to August, culminating in August around 3000 m3\/s, which is followed by a prolonged and gradual decrease until April when discharge falls below 300 m3\/s (JICA, 2020). The peak water level at Madauk typically occurs in August, a month earlier than the peak rainfalls (JICA, 2020) (Fig. 2\n). Precipitations are intense during the rainy season, with a monthly peak and an annual total exceeding 1000\u202fmm and 3000\u202fmm at Madauk (Hasman, 2014; JICA, 2020) (Fig. 2). Rainfall starts to increase in May and reaches a peak in July. The wet season normally ends in October, followed by a prolonged dry season with little precipitation due to the influence of the dry northeast monsoon (Roy and Roy, 2011; Taft and Evers, 2016). Sediment discharge at Madauk peaks over 7000\u202fkg\/s in August, which is in stark contrast to that during the dry season, typically less than 300\u202fkg\/s (JICA, 2020) (Fig. 2). More than 80% of annual sediment discharge occurs during the wet season between June and October in 2013 and 2014 (JICA, 2020). Like water level, peak sediment discharge lags a month behind peak precipitation. Tides in the Sittaung River estuary are predominantly semidiurnal with distinct diurnal and fortnightly inequalities (Rao et al., 2005; Shimozono et al., 2019). Tides are flood-dominated and exemplified by tidal bores that could propagate upstream 100\u202fkm from the river mouth (Stuart, 1932). Peak flood tidal currents reach up to 3\u202fm\/s. During the dry season, the tidal limit is observed 150\u202fkm upstream from the river mouth (Stuart, 1932). Spring tidal range is estimated up to 5\u202fm near Zokali (Shimozono et al., 2019; JICA, 2020) (Fig. 1) and about 4.5\u202fm near Kyaikto (Choi et al., 2020) (Fig. 3\n). During the wet season, the tidal range decreases to two and a half meters at Sutpanu, 15\u202fkm upstream of Kyaikto, due to increased baseflow (JICA, 2020). While the high tide level remains unchanged at 7\u202fm above mean sea level, the low tide water level rises from 2.5\u202fm during the dry season to 5.5\u202fm during the early stage of river floods (Fig. 3; JICA, 2020). No data are available for waves in the Sittaung River estuary, but waves are considered more significant during the wet season when southwesterly winds prevail (e.g., Anthony et al., 2019).\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\nA field campaign was conducted six times all in the dry season from 2014 to 2019 to document morphological and sedimentological characteristics of the point bars of a fluvial-tidal channel with a fluvial reach (KY1), blind tidal channels without a fluvial reach (KY2, KY3, KY4), and tributary rill channels (KY5) at the distal end of the FTZ of the Sittaung River estuary (Fig. 1), which belongs to the zone of bedload convergence (sensu Dalrymple and Choi, 2007) and the inner estuary (Shchepetkina et al., 2019). Over 700 aerial photographs were captured for the point bar at KY4 using DJI Inspire 1 and Phantom 4 pro with 80% frontal and 60% side overlap in December 2015, December 2016, and December 2017. These photographs were processed by Pix4D (version 4.1.12) to create digital elevation models (DEMs) with a ground sampling density of 2\u202fcm. Positions and elevation of ground control points, measured by an RTK-GPS (R10, Trimble Inc., USA) corrected by Trimble CenterPoint\u00ae RTX (2\u202fcm horizontal, 5\u202fcm vertical accuracy), were added to rectify the DEMs. A DEM of Difference (DoD) was analyzed to quantify the morphologic changes of the point bar and the tidal channel using ArcGIS (version 10.1).\nTen trench sections were made and described for sedimentary facies and architectures of the point bars of the channels. Each trench section runs oblique to perpendicular to the channel axis and measures 1\u20134\u202fm long and 0.6\u20131.0\u202fm deep. A total of twenty 60\u202fcm-long cancores were collected from the trenches. Relief peels of the cores were made using epoxy and cheesecloth to describe sedimentary structures in detail. Grain sizes were determined for selected intervals of the cores using a MasterSizer 3000 (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., UK) after removing organic matters with diluted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Layer thicknesses were measured from the high-resolution images of the cored sediments from trench section T7 using Coreldraw Graphics Suite 2018. Spectral analysis was performed using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on a data set of the measured layer thicknesses.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nFluvial-tidal channel\n\n4.1.1\nMorphology\nA fluvial-tidal channel at KY1 is box-shaped in planform and displays well-defined ebb and flood-barb at the downstream and upstream sides of the bend, respectively (Fig. 4B). Scour pools are present around the tight meander bend, disconnected from neighboring tidal pools by sand shoals. The channel is disconnected from the main channel of the Sittaung River at the confluence by sand shoals that are subaerially exposed during spring low tides (Fig. 4A). Gentle-sloping (1\u20132\u00b0), intertidal point bars are developed in the inner bend of the channel. The point bars are covered by current ripples and are devoid of dunes. Ebb-directed ripples are abundant on the upstream side of the point bar, while flood-directed ripples are dominant on the downstream limb of the point bar. Bidirectional ripples appear to occupy the channel base. No significant rill channel is developed on the point bars of the fluvial-tidal channel (Fig. 5A).\n\n\n4.1.2\nSedimentology\nThe point bar of the channel at KY1 consists of interlaminated sands and muds, parallel laminated sands, and ripple cross-laminated sands (Fig. 5C\u2013E). Lamina thickness rarely exceeds 0.5\u202fcm. Ripples are bidirectional and frequently draped by 0.1\u20130.2\u202fcm thick muds. Climbing ripple cross laminations are present in the lower part of the core (Fig. 5E). Deposits are weakly bioturbated. Trough-shaped erosional truncations are common throughout the core. Alternation of thick-thin laminae is observed in the upper part of the point bar (Fig. 5B). Rounded mud pebbles are sparsely distributed and are associated with ripple cross lamination. No grain size data is available.\n\n\n\n4.2\nBlind tidal channel\n\n4.2.1\nMorphology\nBlind tidal channels with no fluvial reach drain tidal flats and saltmarshes at KY2, KY3, and KY4. The tidal channels are typically 15\u201360\u202fm wide and 1\u20131.5\u202fm deep at the bankful stage (Figs. 1E, F, 4). The channels are sinuous in planform and have point bars steeper than those of fluvial-tidal channels at KY1. The upper part of the point bars is fringed by saltmarshes and cultivated areas (Figs. 6\u20139\n\n\n\n). The channels are disconnected from the larger fluvial-tidal channel by sandy shoals at the confluence during spring low tides. Small-scale current ripples occupy the point bar surfaces. Ebb-directed ripples are abundant on the upstream side of the point bar, while flood-directed ripples are dominant on the downstream limb of the point bar at KY3 (Fig. 7E, F).\nSharp-crested, dune-like wavy bedforms are present on the upper point bars of tidal channels at KY4 (6.0\u20136.5\u202fm above mean sea level). The wavy bedforms are 1\u20132\u202fm wide and 20\u201330\u202fcm high, with crestlines mainly oriented perpendicular to the axis of the channel thalweg (Fig. 9). The crestlines are straight to sinuous in planform and occasionally bifurcated. Areas between the crestlines, or rill channels, are mud-rich and have polygonal mud cracks, whereas areas around the crestlines, or inter-rill areas, are siltier and have less distinct mud cracks (Fig. 9A\u2013C). Ebb-directed current ripples are present on the wavy bedforms. The dune-like wavy bedforms lose their configuration towards the lower part of the point bar. Saltmarshes develop above 6.5\u202fm above mean sea level, which is inundated during spring high tides. Saltmarshes encroach rapidly into the upper intertidal zone of tidal point bars after river floods, indicating rapid sediment accumulation during the floods (KY4; Fig. 4C, D).\n\n\n4.2.2\nSedimentology\nThe point bars of the blind tidal channels consist of inclined heterolithic stratification (IHS) (Figs. 6A, 7D, 8B; sensu Thomas et al., 1987). The IHS is composed of rhythmically layered sandy silt and mud, which are inclined at 3\u20136\u00b0 towards the channel. Sandy silt layers are 0.3\u20134.8\u202fcm thick and have sharp bases. Sandy silt layers grade upward into the overlying mud layers, which are mostly less than 0.3\u202fcm thick. Mud layers are not uniform in thickness and tend to be thicker in the topographic low areas or rill channels. Very thin mud layers typically overlie thick silt layers. Layers thicker than 1.5\u202fcm display subcritical to supercritical climbing ripple laminations (Figs. 6C, 8H, I, J, 9D, E). The climbing ripples are bidirectional but tend to be flood (upstream) directed at the upper part and ebb (downstream) directed at the lower part. At KY4, newly deposited layers are dominated by flood-directed climbing ripples (Figs. 8H, I, J, 9D). Small-scale flame structures (0.1\u20130.2\u202fcm high) are common on the top of a mud layer overlain by a thick sandy silt layer. Cuspate-shaped, erosional truncations are common (Figs. 8B, 9C, D, 10A, D). The thick sandy silt layers overlie the truncation surfaces to form a chevron-like upbuilding. Mud breccias and pebbles are typically associated with the truncation surfaces (Figs. 7D, 10D). The truncation surfaces are oriented perpendicular to the tidal channel axis. Rounded mud pebbles are concentrated in the lower IHS of the tidal channels (Fig. 7D). Bioturbation is rare in the sandy silt layers but is occasionally intense in the mud layers. Mean grain sizes range between 4.48 and 5.35 phi (Fig. 10A, B).\nThree types of rhythmic laminations are identified in the point bars of the tidal channels: alternation of thick-thin laminae (Figs. 8F, 10C, E), gradual thickening followed by gradual thinning over 10\u201315 laminae (Figs. 8D, E, 11, 12E\n), and alternation of thick-thin packages consisting of 10\u201315 laminae with cyclic changes of laminae thicknesses (Figs. 8D, E, 11, 12E). The alternation of thick-thin laminae is typical in the uppermost part of the trench section and the muddier intervals that are occasionally truncated and overlain by anomalously thick silt layers (Fig. 8E). The second and third types are only found in the lower part of the point bar deposits. The presence of multiple erosional truncations results in poorly defined tidal rhythmicities in laminae thicknesses of the rhythmites (Fig. 11).\n\n\n\n4.3\nTributary rill channels\n\n4.3.1\nMorphology\nTributary rill channels are present in the upper intertidal zone (6\u20137\u202fm above mean sea level) along the straighter part of the blind tidal channels (KY5; Figs. 12, 13\n) and less frequently on the point bar of the blind tidal channels (KY4; Fig. 9). Dendritic in planform (Fig. 12), the rill channels are typically 10\u201320\u202fm long, 3\u20134\u202fm wide, and 0.5\u202fm deep at the bankful stage. The rill channels are submerged only during spring high tides. Inter-rill areas display a sharp- to round-crested morphology with an undulating topography (Figs. 9, 12B, 13B, C). Small ebb-directed current ripples are present on the surfaces of the rill channels and inter-rill areas. Polygonal mud cracks are common in the rill channels (Figs. 9B, C, 13B, C).\n\n\n4.3.2\nSedimentology\nRill channel deposits consist of ripple cross-laminated very fine sands, interlaminated sandy silt and mud. Mud layers tend to be thicker in the rill channels, whereas sandy silt layers prevail in the inter-rill areas. Bioturbation is weak to moderate. Rootlets of salt-tolerant plants are abundant. Micro-scale flame structures are common on the top of the mud layers, overlain by thick sandy silt layers. Bidirectional ripple cross laminations are common and typically 0.5\u20132\u202fcm thick. Ebb current ripples appear to be dominant. Cyclic changes in laminae thicknesses, including the alternation of thick-thin laminae and gradual thickening followed by gradual thinning over 15\u201320 laminae, are well established in the lower part of the cored section (Fig. 12E, H). Cuspate-shaped truncation surfaces are developed (Fig. 13C). The thick sandy silt layers overlie the truncation surfaces to establish a chevron-like upbuilding of bidirectional cross-laminae (Fig. 13E, F). Mud breccias are occasionally incorporated into the sandy silt layers that drape the truncation surfaces (Fig. 13G). Oxidized beds consisting of interlaminated sandy silt and mud, deposited during previous years, are preserved in the ridge-shaped inter-rill areas but absent in the rill channels, indicating the presence of highly undulatory truncation surfaces (Fig. 12B, C, D). Mean grain sizes of the rill channel deposits range between 4.56 and 5.13 phi, whereas those of the inter-rill areas vary from 4.07 and 4.23 phi (Fig. 12E, F).\n\n\n\n4.4\nMorphological changes of a blind tidal channel at KY4\nThe blind tidal channel at KY4 experienced noticeable morphologic changes between 2015 and 2017 (Fig. 4C, D). The bankful width of the channel decreased sharply from 20\u202fm in 2015 to 7\u202fm in 2016 (Fig. 14\n). The channel continued to narrow down to 5\u202fm in 2017 (Fig. 14). While the channel thalweg and the cutbank maintained their position, the point bar migrated about 12\u202fm in 2016 and 5\u202fm in 2017, reducing more than 75% of the channel cross-section area. The width\/depth ratio of the channel also decreased from about 25 in 2015 to about 9 in 2016 (Fig. 14). The sedimentation rate inferred from the DEM of Difference (DoD) is about 1\u202fm at the lower point bar and is less than 0.2\u202fm at a higher elevation near the saltmarsh in 2016 (Fig. 15\n). A similar magnitude of sedimentation rate was recorded in 2017. Compared to 2015, about 20% of the upper point-bar area covered by saltmarsh was reclaimed by residents for cultivation in 2016 (Fig. 15).\n\n\n4.5\nTidal rhythmicities preserved in the laminae thicknesses\nAlternation of thick-thin laminae is interpreted as the product of diurnal inequality of semidiurnal tides, whereby thick-thin couplets represent higher and lower high tides in a day (de Boer et al., 1989; Choi, 2010). A 10\u201315 laminae package displaying sinusoidal change in laminae thicknesses indicates the synodic control of tides. Thicker and thinner laminae were formed during spring and neap tides, respectively (Kvale et al., 1994; Choi, 2010; Greb et al., 2011). Alternation of the thick and thin packages points to the influence of the anomalistic cycle. The thick and thin packages were deposited during perigean and apogean spring tides, respectively (Kvale et al., 1994; Choi, 2010; Greb et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nTidal versus seasonal sedimentation in the tide-dominated estuary\nPoint bar deposits of the blind tidal channels are dominated by silty tidal rhythmites bearing various tidal cyclicities in laminae thicknesses such as diurnal inequality, neap-spring tidal cycles, and apogean-perigean spring tidal cycles. The well-developed tidal cyclicities point to rapid sedimentation mainly controlled by semidiurnal tides with distinct tropical, synodic and anomalistic cycles (Kvale et al., 1999), which reflects tidal characteristics of the Sittaung River estuary (JICA, 2020). The hierarchical tidal cyclicities are better preserved in the point bars of blind tidal channels than the fluvial-tidal channels at KY1, where tidal cyclicities longer than a neap-spring cycle are absent. Small tidal velocity asymmetry between flood and ebb tide, inferred from the well-developed barbs around the point bars of the channels, may account for the lack of the longer tidal cyclicities in the fluvial-tidal channels (Choi, 2010; Dalrymple et al., 2012). Based on the inferred tidal cyclicities in the point bar deposits, sedimentation rates in the blind tidal channels are estimated to be 0.5\u20135\u202fcm per day and 10\u201315\u202fcm per month, comparable to those in the macrotidal estuaries with extreme spring tidal ranges over 10\u202fm (Dalrymple et al., 1991; Tessier, 1993; Greb et al., 2011). Such high sedimentation rates indicate sediment delivery from the channels to adjacent tidal flats was enormous and continuous to generate well-defined tidal rhythmites. Given strong tidal bores in the Sittaung River estuary (Shimozono et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2020), most sediment transport by tidal currents occurs during flood tides (Fig. 16A). The tidal bores are known to induce an extremely high sedimentation rate of up to 50\u202fcm per day on the tidal flats flanking the main channel of the Sittaung River estuary near Kyaikto (Choi et al., 2020).\nLonger tidal cycles such as neap-spring and perigean-apogean cycles prevail in the lower point bars of the blind tidal channels, but they are absent or incomplete in the upper point bars (Figs. 8D, E, 12E, F). Thickly layered rhythmites displaying an alternation of thick and thin laminae, representing diurnal inequality of semidiurnal tides, are common in the upper point bars (Figs. 8D, E, F, 9, 12E, F). The absence of the longer tidal cycles is unusual for the upper point bars, where infrequent and weaker tidal currents normally facilitate the preservation of the longer-tidal cycles in response to decreasing accommodation space with time (Dalrymple et al., 1991; Tessier, 1993; Pearson and Gingras, 2006; Choi, 2010, 2011b; Greb et al., 2011). The frequent occurrence of the large-scale, cuspate-shaped, high-angle truncation surfaces implies that erosional processes account for the absence of the longer tidal cycles in the upper point bars at KY4 and KY5 (Figs. 9D, E, 12B, 13C, E). The surfaces have a dune-like morphology with crestlines normal to the channel thalweg, suggesting that bank-normal flows rather than bank-parallel flows generated the surfaces. Randomly oriented breccias ripped up from the underlying rhythmites, and chevron-like upbuilding of thickly layered rhythmites overlie the surfaces, indicating rapid sedimentation followed the erosional processes. Upper intertidal elevation and bank-normal orientation of the truncation surfaces preclude the possibility of waves forming the high-relief erosional surfaces (Choi et al., 2004; Choi, 2011a). Tidal currents are also unlikely to form the surfaces because of low shear stress on the upper part of the channel bank during either rising or falling tides. Instead, surface runoff by episodic heavy rainfalls on the exposed channel bank is likely to form the surfaces (Yang et al., 2007; Choi, 2011a; Choi and Jo, 2015). In the event of heavy rainfall on the tidal flats, most of the precipitation cannot infiltrate into the wet tidal-flat surfaces but, instead, turn to the surface runoff (Tolhurst et al., 2006; Pilditch et al., 2008). The strong surface runoff is effective in carrying sediments eroded in the upper intertidal flat or saltmarsh to the lower elevation (Torres et al., 2004; Tolhurst et al., 2006; Pilditch et al., 2008; Kleinhans et al., 2009; Choi, 2011a; Choi and Jo, 2015; Ha et al., 2018). The sediments transported downslope are prone to be remobilized by ensuing tidal currents, hampering the formation of thickly layered rhythmites in the lower elevation.\nThe layer thicknesses of the silty tidal rhythmites range 1\u20135\u202fcm in the upper point bars, whereas they rarely exceed 1\u202fcm in the lower point bars at KY2, KY3, KY4, and KY5 (Figs. 6\u201313). Considering that tidal currents during spring tides generate less than 1\u202fcm thick laminae in the fluvial-tidal channel at KY1 and tidal currents weaken gradually with elevation, the thickly layered rhythmites in the upper point bars are incompatible with the tidal hydrodynamics (Choi et al., 2004). The thickly layered rhythmites include either flood- or ebb-directed climbing ripples and micro-scale flame structures and are devoid of bioturbation, all pointing to rapid sedimentation by decelerating energetic flows with high suspended sediment concentration (Choi, 2010). Such conditions are met during the wet season of the Sittaung River estuary between June and October when increased river discharge reinforces ebb currents and results in highly turbid water into the estuary (JICA, 2020) (Fig. 2). The thickly layered rhythmites draping the high-relief truncation surfaces indicate that sediment-laden flows persisted over several tidal cycles after the initiation of runoff-induced erosion by heavy rainfall events during low tides. Such rapid sedimentation reduced the accommodation space of the channels significantly, accounting for the lack of longer-tidal cycles in the upper point bars (e.g., Choi, 2010, 2011b). Multiple truncation surfaces represent frequent heavy rainfall events during the prolonged wet season (e.g., Choi, 2011a; Choi and Jo, 2015). The thickly layered silty rhythmites with less pronounced tidal rhythmicities in layer thicknesses are attributable to the reduced tidal range because of increased river discharge that effectively elevates low tide level and increases ebb duration (e.g., Horrevoets et al., 2004; Sassi and Hoitink, 2013; Guo et al., 2015; Jay et al., 2015; Hale et al., 2019a, 2019b; JICA, 2020) and the strengthened ebb tidal currents (Choi et al., 2013; Leonardi et al., 2015).\n\n\n5.2\nImplication for the channel morphodynamics of the Sittaung River estuary\nThe Sittaung River estuary has been noted for its large-scale and rapid channel morphodynamics (Stuart, 1932; Hubbard et al., 2011; Brakenridge et al., 2017; Mentaschi et al., 2018; Shimozono et al., 2019; Steijn et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2020). The main channel of the tide-dominated estuary migrated actively to cause remarkable erosion and deposition at both sides of the bank on a wide range of temporal scales from months to centennial (Shimozono et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2020), which is exceptional for tide-dominated estuaries (e.g., Dalrymple et al., 2012). In particular, monthly morphologic changes, such as rapid bar growth, frequent chute-cutoff and subsequent infilling of the cutoff channel, and rapid channel migration with notable cutbank erosion, during low river flows, attest to the influence of tidal currents with high sediment supply (Choi et al., 2020). Strong flood-dominant tidal currents, exemplified by tidal bores, are considered to bring a large amount of sediment originated from neighboring river deltas (e.g., Salween River) into the estuary (Ramaswamy et al., 2004; de Ridder, 2017; Anthony et al., 2019; Shimozono et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). The up-estuary sediment transport may reduce channel size relative to the tidal prism and keep the main channel shallow, leading to active bar-channel morphodynamics (Steijn et al., 2020). The widespread presence of tidal rhythmites in the point bars of the blind tidal channels near Kyaikto is congruent with the fact that tidal currents played a dominant role in the morphodynamic evolution of the Sittaung River estuary, particularly during low river flows. Given the paucity of fluvial upstream reach and the dominance of flood-current directed climbing ripples in the newly deposited layers over the erosional truncation surfaces (Figs. 8J, H, I, J, 9D), rapid infilling of the blind tidal channels at KY4 highlights the role of flood tidal currents in delivering sediment landward from the main channel via the blind tidal channels to the tidal flats and saltmarsh, accounting for the rapid morphodynamic changes during the dry season. Active reclamation of saltmarshes by residents seems to promote the infilling as it decreases tidal current speeds by reducing local tidal prism and enhances a flood-tide dominance (van Maren et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2017; Leuven et al., 2018).\nThe Sittaung River estuary displays annual to multiannual morphologic changes, featuring a notable shift in the main-channel position with frequent chute-cutoffs and channel abandonment (Shimozono et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2020; Steijn et al., 2020). Although the morphologic changes appear to be associated with strong tidal currents with marked tidal asymmetry (Shimozono et al., 2019), Choi et al. (2020) documented that the changes are attributable to the increased discharge during the wet season when the discharge is more than ten times as great compared to the dry season (Ahmed et al., 2019; Steijn et al., 2020). The present study revealed that the point bars of the blind tidal channels consist of thickly layered tidal rhythmites with indistinct tidal rhythmicities and multiple truncation surfaces, suggesting the distal part of the FTZ of the Sittaung River estuary is significantly affected by sedimentation during the wet season. Therefore, pronounced morphologic changes are highly likely to occur in the tidal flats and saltmarshes during the wet season despite their position in the distal end of the FTZ of the estuary, where tidal amplification occurs due to funnel-shaped planform and large tidal prism relative to the river discharge (Deloffre et al., 2006; Dalrymple et al., 2012). Such river-flood-driven morphologic changes are incompatible with the typical tide-dominated estuaries, where tidal currents offset river flows over the long period to produce a zone of bedload convergence that is morphodynamically inactive (Dalrymple and Choi, 2007). Qiangtang River estuary in China is the only known example of the tide-dominated estuary whose morphology is significantly modified by seasonal river floods (Fan et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2018). Although the main channel in the Qiangtang River estuary used to shift its thalweg remarkably after river floods before the levee embankment (Chen et al., 1990), the estuary is currently responding to seasonal river flood by bed-level changes rather than lateral channel migration presumably due to the construction of unerodable artificial levee (Fan et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2017, 2018). As the estuary experiences sediment export during the wet season and import during the dry season (Xie et al., 2017, 2018), no river flood deposits seem to be preserved in the estuary. In contrast, seasonal flooding events are well registered in the tidal flats and saltmarshes of the Sittaung River estuary, implying that the inner part of the estuary is charged with sediments throughout the year due to sediment input from both upstream during the wet season and downstream during the dry season (Ramaswamy et al., 2004; Rao et al., 2005; Anthony et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). High sedimentation rates inferred from the rhythmites suggest that the turbidity maximum has remained at the inner estuary during the wet season, which contrasts with another tide-dominated estuary (e.g., Deloffre et al., 2006, 2007) and delta (Staub et al., 2000), where low sedimentation rates can occur in the tidal flats during high river discharge when the turbidity maximum is expelled from the estuary or distributary channel. Continued sediment supply into the inner part of the Sittaung River estuary may account for the remarkable morphologic changes in the Sittaung River estuary over various temporal scales ranging from months to centennial (e.g., Constantine et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2020; Steijn et al., 2020). Although it is challenging to quantify the relative importance between tidal currents and seasonal river floods in terms of sedimentation and morphologic change based on the present dataset, the prevalence of thickly layered rhythmites with basal truncation surfaces suggests that seasonal river floods exert a significant role in the morphodynamic evolution of the tidal flats and saltmarshes in the inner part of the tide-dominated Sittaung River estuary.\n\n\n5.3\nImplications for paleoenvironmental and paleogeographic reconstruction in the fluvial-tidal transition zone\nThe point bars of the blind tidal channels in the inshore tidal flats and saltmarshes of the Sittaung River estuary register sedimentation of tide and river floods despite the lack of fluvial upstream reaches. Persistently rhythmic nature of the deposits with well-defined mud drapes, bidirectional ripple cross-bedding, and thickly layered rhythmites suggest that the blind tidal channels are located seaward of salinity limit even during river flood or distal portion of FTZ, where tides are supposed to be dominant throughout the river flood (Dalrymple et al., 2015). The occurrence of silty tidal rhythmites bearing river-flood sedimentation in the blind tidal channel sounds counterintuitive as the channel is considered a tide-dominant regime (e.g., Dalrymple, 2010; Hughes, 2012). Furthermore, the thickly layered tidal rhythmites formed during river floods are rarely documented from the FTZ of the modern estuarine environments, where seasonal river discharge fluctuation is insignificant compared to the tidal prism (Dalrymple et al., 1991; Tessier, 1993; Pearson and Gingras, 2006; Dalrymple and Choi, 2007; Greb et al., 2011; Choi et al., 2013; Choi and Jo, 2015). In contrast, tidal rhythmites have been documented from ancient tide-dominated estuaries (Hovikoski et al., 2008) and more frequently from a deltaic setting, where distributary channels or prodelta receive seasonal high river discharge to develop tidal rhythmites with anomalously thick neap-spring cycles (Kvale et al., 1994; Miller and Eriksson, 1997; Rebata et al., 2006; Eilertsen et al., 2011; McLean and Wilson, 2016). The present study showcased that the thickly layered tidal rhythmites can develop seasonally in the distal portion of the FTZ of tide-dominated estuaries influenced by a strong monsoon.\nRiver flood deposits formed in the FTZ of tide-dominated systems tend to be coarser-grained and more thickly layered than those formed during low river flows, representing higher energy conditions and suspended sediment concentrations during river floods (Dalrymple et al., 2015). Blind tidal channels in the Sittaung River estuary do not display a marked difference in textural composition between high and low river-flow deposits. Tidal flats and saltmarshes in the FTZ of the Sittaung River estuary seem to receive fine to very fine sands even during the river floods, presumably due to their distal location in the FTZ (Choi et al., 2020). Texturally bimodal composition caused by variations in river discharge appears to be the case in the proximal part of the FTZ (e.g., van den Berg et al., 2007; Dalrymple et al., 2012; Martinius and van den Berg, 2011; Shchepetkina et al., 2016a, 2016b). The directionality of sediment transport registered in the point bar deposits also helps identify the relative position within the FTZ. Several outcrop studies of the FTZ documented that the river flood deposits are characterized by unidirectional, downstreamward sediment transport while the deposits formed during low river flows exhibit bidirectional sediment transport (Dalrymple et al., 2015; Gugliotta et al., 2016a, 2016b; Jablonski and Dalrymple, 2016). Such abrupt changes in sediment transport direction in response to river discharge fluctuations are likely to occur in the proximal part of the FTZ, where tidal currents can be easily modulated by the increase of river discharge owing to the smaller tidal prism in the upstream direction. Changes in sediment transport direction are rarely noted from the tidal rhythmites affected by river floods because the rhythmites consist of parallel lamination from which sediment transport direction is difficult to infer (e.g., Kvale et al., 1994; Miller and Eriksson, 1997; Hovikoski et al., 2008; Eilertsen et al., 2011; Dalrymple et al., 2015; McLean and Wilson, 2016). In contrast, river-flood-influenced intervals of the tidal rhythmites in the Sittaung River estuary contain both ebb and flood-directed climbing ripples (Figs. 6, 8, 9), indicating that sediment transport is bidirectional even during river flood due to large tidal prism (Choi et al., 2020; Steijn et al., 2020) (Fig. 16C). The dominance of flood-directed climbing ripples in the upper part of newly formed point-bar deposits (Figs. 8, 9), indicating that sediment transport is increasingly in the landward direction towards the end of the river flood and flow conditions return to flood tide dominance during the waning stages of river floods in the estuary (Choi et al., 2020). The tidal rhythmites in the Sittaung River estuary showcased that sediment transport direction also varies in response to seasonal changes in relative influence between tide and river flood in the distal part of the FTZ, encouraging the use of paleocurrent directions in estimating the relative position within the FTZ.\nSharp-crested, bank-normal, high-relief truncation surfaces in the point bar deposits from the present study attest to the role of rainfall events associated with river floods (Fig. 16B). As the heavy rainfall can induce severe erosion on the subaerially exposed surfaces (Choi, 2011a), the presence of the truncation surfaces seems to be diagnostic of the intertidal origin of the deposits. Such truncation surfaces are rarely documented from other estuarine or deltaic tidal rhythmites, suggesting that the rhythmites were deposited in the subtidal or intertidal setting with less intense rainfall (e.g., Cowan et al., 1998; Jaeger and Nittrouer, 1995; Dalrymple et al., 1991). Tidal rhythmites with high-relief truncation surfaces were documented from the Tonganoxie Sandstone (Carboniferous), estuarine deposits from eastern Kansas, USA (Lanier et al., 1993; Archer et al., 1994). Although the origin of the truncation surfaces was not elaborated, the coexistence of raindrop marks and surface drain features, as well as thickly layered silty rhythmites, suggests that rhythmic deposition occurred in the intertidal zone with the intermittent influence of heavy rainfall (Lanier et al., 1993; Archer et al., 1994). Similar truncation surfaces have also been noted from the Korean tidal flats where heavy rainfall events during low tides produced high-relief erosional surfaces on the intertidal flats (Yang et al., 2007; Choi, 2011a; Choi et al., 2013; Choi and Jo, 2015). The truncation surfaces tend to occur in the upper point bars, implying that higher elevations are more vulnerable to heavy rainfall than lower elevations due to prolonged exposure time. Thickly layered rhythmites typically overlie the truncation surfaces in the point bars of the Sittaung River estuary, indicating that the accommodation space generated by the rainfall-induced erosion during the early stage of river flood is rapidly filled up with sediments during the remainder of the flood because of the heightened level of suspended sediment concentrations (Fig. 16C).\nThe stratigraphic architecture of the point bars formed in the tide-dominated estuary with significant river influence differs from the estuarine tidal point bars with insignificant river influence. The latter consists of an upward fining succession in which well-developed tidal rhythmites are present in the upper part (Choi and Dalrymple, 2004; Choi et al., 2004, 2013; Hovikoski et al., 2008; Choi, 2010, 2011b; Dalrymple, 2010; Choi and Jo, 2015). Seasonal river floods may introduce coarse sediments such as gravels on the channel floor, producing a markedly bimodal association of river-flood deposits and tidal deposits (Dalrymple et al., 2012; Shchepetkina et al., 2016b). In channels that lack significant river input of coarse materials, such as blind tidal channels that drain inshore tidal flats of the Sittaung River estuary, channel floor deposits appear to consist of tidal deposits (Dalrymple et al., 2012; Ghinassi et al., 2021). Estuarine tidal point bars with insignificant river discharge often display alternating laminated and burrowed sediments in the upper part, resulting from seasonal variations in composition and temperature of the water that drive changes in the intensity of bioturbation rather than discharge fluctuation (van den Berg, 1981; Dalrymple et al., 1991, 2012; Pearson and Gingras, 2006). In contrast, estuarine tidal point bars affected by river floods tend to develop thickly layered rhythmites in the upper part of the succession bounded by multiple truncation surfaces (Fig. 17\n). Unlike typical estuarine tidal rhythmites, tidal cyclicities longer than neap-spring tidal cycles are scarce due to the insufficient accommodation space caused by rapid infill of sediments and erosional processes caused by frequent rainfall-induced erosion during the river floods. The present study showcased that point bars of the blind tidal channels in the distal part of the FTZ of the estuary can be dominated by seasonal sedimentation, implying that the architecture of the blind tidal channels mimics that of fluvial-tidal channels. The point bars of the blind tidal channels appear to have better developed tidal rhythmites than those of fluvial-tidal channels, as the latter are likely to have lower preservation potential of rhythmic sedimentation due to the greater influence of river discharge, particularly during high river flows. Macrotidal regimes, exemplified by strong tidal bores, high sediment supply throughout the year, and extremely seasonal river discharge with the large peak discharge combined, appear to result in the development of wide FTZ in the Sittaung River estuary (e.g., Choi et al., 2020), and facilitate the coexistence of seasonal and tidal sedimentation in the blind tidal channels even at the distal location of the FTZ.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nPoint bars of the blind tidal channels in the distal part of FTZ of the Sittaung River estuary are dominated by tidal rhythmites, resulting from tidal and seasonal river-flood sedimentation. Tidal rhythmites formed during the dry season exhibit hierarchical tidal cycles such as diurnal inequality, spring-neap cycle, and fortnightly inequality. In contrast, the rhythmites formed during the river flood are characterized by anomalously thick layers with less pronounced tidal rhythmicities that overlie sharp-crested, high-relief truncation surfaces. The wet-season rhythmites display chevron-like upbuilding over the truncation surfaces formed by heavy rainfall during low tide and occupy the upper point bars of the blind tidal channels. Flood-tide dominance during the dry season and river floods during the wet season combined have led to the rapid infilling of blind tidal channels, accounting for the rapid growth of tidal flats and saltmarshes in the FTZ of the Sittaung River estuary. Despite the lack of upstream fluvial reach and the distal location within the FTZ, the stratigraphic architecture of the blind tidal channels and their tributaries is influenced by seasonal river floods due to sustained high sediment loads and the interaction of the macrotidal regime and the large peak river discharge driven by monsoon precipitation. The present study showcased that paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the blind tidal channels can be challenging in tide-dominated estuaries, where a monsoon river is active, as the stratigraphic architecture of the channels mimics that of fluvial-tidal channels.\n\n\nData availability\nDatasets related to this article can be found at https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17632\/6bcdrpv4r6.1, an open-source online data repository hosted by Mendeley Data (K.

Hydrocarbon-bearing foreland basins are also one of the primary targets for low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture and storage (Sun et al., 2020). Alluvial and fluvial fans are the main deposits at active margins of non-marine foreland basins (DeCelles and Cavazza, 1999; Horton and Decelles, 2001; Ventra and Clarke, 2018). Alluvial fans are often dominated by conglomeratic facies, and can be concurrent with flow deposits of larger distributive fluvial systems, which transfer large volumes of coarse and fine sediments across basins (Williams et al., 1998; Weissmann et al., 2013, 2015). These coarse clastic belts are generally restricted in radial extent and are architecturally complex due to the lack of viable conceptual models. Thus, hydrocarbon exploration and development at continental basin margins are generally considered to be high risk with low return (Moscariello, 2018). However, alluvial fan and fluvial fan successions at basin margins may have good preservation potential if the subsidence rate is sufficient to generate accommodation for the resultant and significant sediment thickness (Moscariello, 2005). At basin margins, variable sedimentary characteristics from proximal to relatively distal environments, complex structural characteristics due to intensive deformation, and intensive diagenesis due to fluid flow of various local and external fluids can result in high levels of reservoir heterogeneity. Thus, reservoir quality in such settings is mainly controlled by their primary sedimentary characteristics, e.g., petrographic characteristics and stratigraphic sequence, as well as secondary diagenetic and fracturing processes that they experience (e.g., Morad et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011; Watkins et al., 2018). Due to limited well data and seismic resolution of subsurface reservoirs, outcrop analogues play an important role in improving the accuracy of reservoir prediction in the subsurface (Howell et al., 2014), by providing reliable geological conceptual models and quantitative attribute information (Dichiarante et al., 2020). It is therefore essential to systematically study outcropping reservoir analogues to fully understand and predict the distribution and reservoir potential of alluvial-fluvial deposits in the subsurface.\nThe northern margin of the Ebro Foreland Basin and the adjacent South Pyrenean fold-and-thrust belt present multiple alluvial fans and distributive fluvial systems (Paleogene to Neogene). For example, the Huesca and Luna systems (Oligocene to Miocene) and a series of marginal alluvial fans in the northern margin of the central Ebro Basin have been well documented (Hirst and Nichols, 1986; Nichols and Hirst, 1998; Arenas et al., 2001; Yuste et al., 2004; Luz\u00f3n, 2005; Nichols, 2005; Donselaar and Overeem, 2008; Martin et al., 2021). Similar Upper Eocene to Oligocene alluvial and fluvial systems developed in the north-eastern margin of the Ebro Basin. For example, the conglomerate-dominated Berga Group found near the frontal thrust sheets translated into fluvial deposits of the Solsona Formation towards the foreland basin (S\u00e1ez, 1987; Ford et al., 1997; Williams et al., 1998; S\u00e1ez et al., 2007; de Gibert and S\u00e1ez, 2009; Barrier et al., 2010). Based on outcrop investigations near the thrust sheets, Williams et al. (1998) interpreted the Berga Group as being the deposits from a type II alluvial fan as a consequence of repeated subaerial sheetflood and mass movement events (sensu Blair and McPherson (1994a, 1994b)). More recently, after examination of new outcrops across the Puig-reig anticline, Barrier et al. (2010) identified two distinct alluvial fans in the Berga Group. The first one is a large braided-stream-flow-dominated alluvial fan, which is related to the majority of the Berga Group deposits. The large alluvial fan was fed by a regional drainage basin including the south Pyrenean cover thrust sheets and the Pyrenean Axial Zone (Verg\u00e9s, 2007). The second one is a small and local alluvial fan, which developed after the first large fan at the top of the Berga Group and is dominated by stream and gravity flows. This small alluvial fan was fed by a local drainage basin, extending only on the outermost cover thrust sheets.\nPrevious studies of the alluvial-fluvial deposits in the north-eastern Ebro Foreland Basin focused on the description and interpretation of the sedimentary environments and the interactions between sedimentation and tectonic activities (Williams et al., 1998; S\u00e1ez et al., 2007; Barrier et al., 2010; Carrigan et al., 2016). The Ebro Basin has been assessed as one of the priority regions for CO2 storage development in Spain (Sun et al., 2021a). The alluvial-fluvial strata show high potential to become effective reservoirs. For example, the Puig-reig anticline was assessed as a potential site for gas storage (Instituto Geol\u00f3gico y Minero de Espa\u00f1a, 1995). Besides, the well-exposed outcrops can provide excellent reservoir analogues to determine the reservoir potential of folded alluvial-fluvial successions at foreland basin margins. In this study, we focus on the Puig-reig anticline, which continuously exposes high-quality outcrops that present variations of sedimentary facies across the structure. We quantitatively describe and interpret the lithofacies and sedimentary facies as well as their distribution over the Puig-reig anticline. In addition, based on a comprehensive analysis of lithofacies, cement, porosity, and fracture distribution, we determine the reservoir quality of different lithofacies considering their structural positions along the anticline. Based on the comparison between the Puig-reig anticline and other areas worldwide, we explore the reservoir potential of the studied anticline and other similar systems at foreland basin margins. This allows an assessment of how primary depositional characteristics as well as subsequent diagenetic and tectonic processes may influence the resource and storage potential of foreland basin proximal deposits.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Pyrenees is a doubly verging orogenic belt that formed during the continental collision between the Iberian and European plates from Late Cretaceous to Miocene (Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2002). This orogenic belt is characterised by an antiformal stack of basement-involved thrusts (the Axial Zone) surrounded by two fold-and-thrust belts that were transported to the north and south over the Aquitanian (France) and Ebro (Spain) foreland basins, respectively (Choukroune, 1989; Roure et al., 1989; Mu\u00f1oz, 1992). The eastern part of the Ebro Basin displays an irregular shape bounded by the Pyrenees to the north and the Catalan Coastal Range to the southeast (Fig. 1A, B) (Verg\u00e9s, 1993). The Vallfogona thrust represents the major frontal thrust between the SE Pyrenean thrust sheets and the Ebro Basin (Verg\u00e9s et al., 1998). The Busa syncline and the Puig-reig anticline developed along the footwall of the Vallfogona thrust during Late Eocene and Oligocene (Fig. 1B, C) (Verg\u00e9s, 1993). The Busa syncline developed over a blind thrust flat (Busa thrust) connected to the Vallfogona floor thrust. A geometric reconstruction allowed an interpretation of the Puig-reig anticline as the consequence of a duplex stack at depth (Verg\u00e9s, 1993). The Puig-reig anticline is a km-scale south-verging gentle anticline with a flat hinge. The fold-trend is ESE\/WNW, slightly oblique to the main Pyrenean structures (Verg\u00e9s, 1993).\nThe Ebro Basin sediment fill includes synorogenic Paleocene to Miocene marine to non-marine deposits lying on top of the Paleozoic basement and Mesozoic sediments (Fig. 1C). The lower part of the Puig-reig anticline is mainly composed of deltaic sandstones and marine marls of the Banyoles and Igualada formations (Middle-to-Upper Eocene), which deposited between the Beuda and Cardona evaporitic formations (Verg\u00e9s et al., 1992; Serra-Kiel et al., 2003a, 2003b). These deposits were followed by alluvial-fluvial sediments of the Berga Group and the Solsona Formation (Upper Eocene to Oligocene). These were deposited during the endorheic stage of the Ebro Basin (Puigdef\u00e0bregas et al., 1986, 1992) after a rapid transition from marine to continental depositional environments (Costa et al., 2010). To the north, at the footwall of the Vallfogona thrust, the Berga Group consists of >2000\u202fm-thick alluvial and proximal fluvial conglomerates interbedded with minor sandstones and claystones, which displays growth strata (Ford et al., 1997; Suppe et al., 1997). To the south, the Berga deposits become progressively finer-grained and thinner-bedded fluvial conglomerates, sandstones and claystones of the Solsona Formation (Williams et al., 1998; Barrier et al., 2010). These fluvial deposits translated downstream to distal terminal deposits of the S\u00faria Formation (S\u00e1ez et al., 2007). These terminal deposits graded into evaporites and calcareous lacustrine strata towards the centre of the Ebro Basin, e.g., the Barbastro, Castelltallat and Calaf formations (S\u00e1ez, 1987; Del Santo et al., 2000; S\u00e1ez et al., 2007). Collectively, these formations represent the basin proximal to basin centre facies within an internally drained continent basin. The subdivision of the Berga Group used in this study (Fig. 1D) follows the scheme of Williams et al. (1998). In the study area, we focus on the Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation, a sub-unit of the Middle Berga Group, that covers the northern zone of the Busa syncline and a large area of the Puig-reig anticline, and the Solsona Formation that is mainly observed in the south limb of the anticline (Fig. 1D, E).\n\n\n3\nOutcrops and methods\nThe Puig-reig anticline presents excellent outcrops along roads that cut through the structure in a roughly north-south direction, between the towns of Sant Lloren\u00e7 de Morunys in the north and Solsona in the south (Fig. 1B, D). Eight high-resolution (decimetre-scale) stratigraphic logs with a total thickness exceeding 3000\u202fm were created from eight cross-sections (Fig. 1D). Among these, logs A, B1, C, E and H represent the strata of the Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation (Middle Berga Group), while logs B2, D and G correspond to the Solsona Formation. The ca. 9\u202fkm-long geological cross-section of the Puig-reig anticline (sections A, B1 and B2; Fig. 1E) is roughly parallel to the N-S shortening direction of the South-eastern Pyrenees and displays the continuous transition from proximal to relatively distal deposits. Moreover, log I of the Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation in the northern zone of the Busa syncline (Fig. 1D) from Barrier et al. (2010) was utilised in this study for comparison. The detailed sedimentary data acquired includes bed thickness and geometry, grain size and sedimentary structures, which collectively allow the identification of lithofacies and facies associations. The Puig-reig anticline was divided into five structural units from north to south (i.e., north limb, crest-north limb transition zone, crest, crest-south limb transition zone and south limb; Fig. 1E). The terms \u2018proximal\u2019 and \u2018distal\u2019 were not used to name the structural units as in other studies (e.g., Ge et al., 1997; Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2002) to avoid potential confusions with sedimentary system terms used to divide facies and depositional environments (i.e., proximal, medial and distal fan deposits).\nTo determine rock composition, diagenetic alteration and intergranular porosity, 108 polished thin sections were made from collected samples. These samples are representative of the different lithofacies that can be defined in the area and different structural units of the anticline. Petrographic observations were made using a Zeiss Axiophot optical microscope and a Technosyn Cold Cathodoluminescence microscope, model 8200 Mk5-1 operating 16 to 17\u202fkV and 270 to 290\u202f\u03bcA gun current. Among these, 30 sandstone thin sections were selected for rock composition analysis using the point-counting method (300\u2013400 points) to reveal potential compositional variations in different depositional environments. In total, 60 thin sections were analysed using NIS Elements and Image J software (Schneider et al., 2012) to quantitatively process microphotographs to determine cement content and intergranular porosity. Cement content equals the percentage content of calcite cement, which was determined using microphotographs in cathodoluminescence based on the colour differences between components (Fig. 2A). Intergranular porosity equals the percentage content of intergranular pores, which was determined using microphotographs in parallel Nicols (Fig. 2B). To quantitatively analyse the effect of diagenetic alteration on porosity loss, the original porosity (P\n\no\n) of different lithologies was calculated based on Scherer's empirical formula (Scherer, 1987). The proportions of original porosity destroyed by cementation (PL\n\ncem\n) and by compaction (PL\n\ncom\n) of different lithologies were calculated based on Houseknecht's formulas (Houseknecht, 1987):\n\n(1)\n\n\nP\no\n\n=\n20.91\n+\n22.9\n\/\n\nS\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nPL\ncem\n\n=\n\n\nP\ncem\n\n\nP\no\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nPL\ncom\n\n=\n\n\n\nP\no\n\n\u2212\n\nP\ncem\n\n\u2212\n\nP\nr\n\n\n\n\/\n\nP\no\n\n\u00d7\n100\n%\n\n\nwhere S\n\no\n is the Trask sorting coefficient of grain size, whose values of different lithologies were acquired from grain size analysis data from Sun (2018); P\n\ncem\n is the percentage content of cement; and P\n\nr\n is the percentage content of residual intergranular porosity.\nAbundant fractures were observed in the folded sediments of the Puig-reig anticline due to intensive tectonic deformation, which could have a significant effect on reservoir potential as important fluid migration pathways and storage space. Fracture attributes of the Puig-reig anticline were collected by Sun et al. (2021b) using the linear scanline method (Fig. 2C). Fracture intensity is the number of fractures per unit length of scanline and equals the reciprocal of fracture spacing. Fracture data of the Puig-reig anticline from Sun et al. (2021b) was incorporated into this study to comprehensively analyse the reservoir potential in the anticline.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSedimentology\nEight lithofacies were identified based on lithological characteristics and sedimentary structures, including three conglomerate facies, four sandstone facies, and one fine-grained (mud dominated) facies (Table 1\n). Five subsequent facies associations were then defined.\n\n4.1.1\nLithofacies\n\n4.1.1.1\nConglomerate lithofacies (Gsh1, Gsh2 and Gch)\nBased on bed geometry (sheet-like and channelised geometries) and subtle internal lithological differences, the conglomerate lithofacies is subdivided into three subfacies (Gsh1, Gsh2 and Gch). All subfacies have polygenic clasts composed of carbonate, siliciclastic, igneous and metamorphic lithologies. In subfacies Gsh1, the clasts consist of very poorly sorted and subrounded to subangular pebbles to small boulders, with occasional outsize carbonate clasts. This lithofacies is clast- to matrix-supported. The matrix consists of reddish sands to small pebbles and lacks clays (Fig. 3A). Gsh1 conglomerate bodies tend to present a massive structure and minor rough-stratified layers, unscoured or slightly scoured basal surfaces (Fig. 3B), and a sheet-like geometry. The thickness of a single bed can range from 1 to 6\u202fm (Fig. 4A), while bed associations can be up to around 50\u202fm. Horizons can be traced over several kilometres using satellite imagery. Gsh1 is only found in the upper part of log C, in the northwest zone of the Puig-reig anticline.\nSubfacies Gsh2 has relatively smaller grain size and lower matrix content compared to subfacies Gsh1, and stratified structure and unscoured basal surfaces are rarely observed. This lithofacies is composed of poorly sorted and subrounded pebbles to cobbles. It is mainly clast-supported and contains grey to reddish matrix of fine to coarse sands (Fig. 3C). Gsh2 conglomerate bodies are massive, and have scoured basal surfaces with different scour intensities (Fig. 3D), and a sheet-like geometry. The thickness of a single bed generally ranges between 1 and 5\u202fm, while bed associations can be up to around 50\u202fm (Fig. 4B). Gsh2 develops in the north limb, mainly in log C and the upper part of logs A and E.\nSubfacies Gch consists of moderately to poorly sorted and subrounded pebble to small cobble size clasts, which tend to be clast-supported with grey, fine to coarse sand matrix (Fig. 3E). Gch conglomerate bodies generally present channelised geometries and deep scoured basal surfaces (Fig. 3F), which differ from Gsh1 and Gsh2 conglomerate bodies. Gch presents lateral wedge-out and changes laterally and vertically to sandstones and claystones (Sm, Sl and F) (Fig. 4C, D). The thickness of a single bed generally ranges from 0.5 to 4\u202fm. Gch is the most widespread conglomerate lithofacies, which develops in most areas of the anticline except for the south limb.\n\n\n4.1.1.2\nSandstone lithofacies (Smi, Sm, Sl and Sch)\nSubfacies Smi includes reddish to grey, medium and coarse sandstones and minor fine sandstones. These sandstone layers tend to present a massive structure with locally scattered gravel clasts of a few millimetres in size, and in some minor cases parallel bedding can be observed. Beds range in thickness from 0.2 to 2\u202fm. They can have a tabular geometry and be interbedded with Gsh2 (Fig. 3G) or occur as sandstone lenses within Gsh1 and Gsh2 conglomerate bodies that rapidly pinch out laterally (Fig. 3H). Very limited large (with diameter up to 1.5\u202fcm) vertical or oblique burrows are observed in these coarse sand deposits. Smi mainly develops in the north limb of the anticline.\nSubfacies Sm is mainly composed of grey medium to coarse sandstones. Sm has relatively lower matrix contents and better grain sorting than Smi. Sm sandstone layers tend to present a massive structure with bed thickness ranging from 0.5 to 1.5\u202fm (Fig. 3I). They show a tabular geometry with sharp and unscoured basal surfaces. They are commonly found above Gch layers or interbedded with laminated fine sandstones (Sl) and claystones (F). Limited burrows are observed in these coarse sandstone layers. Sm is one of the dominant lithofacies and is widely observed across the anticline.\nSubfacies Sl is composed of grey, fine to very fine sandstones and minor medium sandstones. Parallel bedding is the most common structure (Fig. 3I), while cross bedding is occasionally observed (Fig. 3J). Sl tends to be interbedded with Sm and fine deposits (F). Vertical, oblique or horizontal burrows are more commonly present in these fine sandstones (Fig. 3K). Sl is another dominant lithofacies and widely developed across the anticline.\nSubfacies Sch is composed of grey, medium to coarse sandstones, with scattered gravelly clasts (Fig. 3L, M). It has a similar massive structure as Sm layers, but has a channelised geometry with scoured surfaces and generally develops at the bottom of lithofacies association (Fig. 4E, F). Muddy rip-up clasts are sometimes present at the bottom of Sch due to the scour and re-deposition of fine deposits (Fig. 3M). Sch mainly develops in the south limb of the anticline.\n\n\n4.1.1.3\nFine-grained lithofacies (F)\nLithofacies F includes reddish to grey siltstones and claystones. They occur as tabular bodies and are commonly interbedded with Sm and Sl (Fig. 3N). Small burrows and other trace fossils, e.g., Taenidium barretti and Helminthoidichnites (de Gibert and S\u00e1ez, 2009) are very common in these fine deposits (Fig. 3O). These deposits tend to be affected by intensive weathering, erosion and pedogenesis. Lithofacies F is widely developed across the anticline. Bed thickness varies significantly from around 10\u202fcm to up to around 4.5\u202fm, and increasing in presence from the north to the south limb of the anticline.\n\n\n\n4.1.2\nLithofacies associations and sedimentary environments\n\n4.1.2.1\nProximal fluvial fan: unconfined flash flood deposits with no overbank deposits (LAp1)\nLAp1 association is dominated by lithofacies Gsh1 with limited Smi interlayers that generally pinch out laterally as sandstone lenses (Figs. 4A, 5A). These lihtofacies combine into large and structureless sheet-like bodies of coarse deposits with unscoured or slightly scoured basal surfaces (Fig. 3B). These characteristics collectively represent unconfined flow of a flashy nature (Blair and McPherson, 1994a; Nichols and Hirst, 1998; Williams et al., 1998). This association is dominantly found in the northwest portion of the Puig-reig anticline, i.e., the upper part of log C.\n\n\n4.1.2.2\nProximal fluvial fan: unconfined flash flood and wide-shallow channel deposits with limited overbank deposits (LAp2)\nLAp2 association is dominated by lithofacies Gsh2 and Smi with limited Sm, Sl and F (Figs. 4B, 5B). Lithofacies Smi can occur as stable tabular layers or pinch-out lenses in Gsh2. This association presents large and structureless sheet-like geometries, with scoured surfaces of varying intensities (Figs. 3D, 4B). These features can collectively represent unconfined flow of a flashy nature or wide-shallow channel flow (Arenas et al., 2001; Yuste et al., 2004; Luz\u00f3n, 2005). This association is dominantly found in the north limb of the anticline, mainly in log C and the upper part of logs A and E.\n\n\n4.1.2.3\nMedium fluvial fan: channel fill deposits with overbank deposits (LAm1 and LAm2)\nLAm1 association is composed of lithofacies Gch, Sm, Sl, and F. An overall fining-upward trend is observed in this lithofacies association, from channelised Gch to tabular and interbedded Sm, Sl and F lithofacies (Figs. 4C, 5C). Sometimes, vertical accretion of channels can be observed (Fig. 4D). These features can collectively represent the deposits of braided channel streams and overbank areas (Nichols and Hirst, 1998; Arenas et al., 2001). This lithofacies association is distributed across the anticline except for the south limb of the anticline. LAm2 association is composed of lithofacies Sch, Sm, Sl and F and presents an overall fining-upward trend from channel fill sandy deposits to overbank fine deposits (Figs. 4E, 5D). Compared to LAm1 association, lithofacies Sch replaces Gch conglomerate bodies as channel lag deposits in LAm2 association. In addition, this association has more overbank fine deposits and occasional lateral accretion of channels (Fig. 4F). This association is dominantly found in the south limb and slightly developed in the crest and crest-south limb transition zone of the anticline. Thus, LAm2 association is deposits found further downstream but still in a medial setting, in comparison to LAm1. These features can collectively represent the sedimentary environment of braided to meandering channel streams and overbank areas. Such sandy meandering channels in medial fluvial system have also been documented at the north margin of the Ebro Basin (e.g., Arenas et al., 2001; Luz\u00f3n, 2005).\n\n\n4.1.2.4\nMedium fluvial fan: stable overbank deposits incised by isolated channels (LAm3)\nLAm3 association is composed of lithofacies Sch, Sl and F, which is characterised by channelised Sch bodies incising stable tabular F and Sl deposits (Figs. 4G, 5E). Compared to LAm2 association, LAm3 contains more overbank fine deposits and isolated channels. This association could have been deposited from isolated meandering channels or the wings of channels. This association is occasionally found in the south limb of the anticline.\n\n\n4.1.2.5\nDistribution of lithofacies associations and sedimentary environments\nThe characteristics of the described lithofacies associations (Fig. 5) can collectively represent deposits from a proximal to medial fluvial fan system in the Puig-reig anticline. The proximal deposits are mainly composed of LAp1 and LAp2 lithofacies associations deposited from unconfined flash floods and wide-shallow channels, with minor LAm1 lithofacies association. The medial deposits are composed of LAm1 to LAm3 lithofacies associations deposited from braided to meandering channel streams and overbank areas. The relatively proximal part of the medial fluvial fan (proximal-medial fan) is mainly composed of LAm1 and limited LAm2 associations, while the relatively distal part of the medial fluvial fan (medial-distal fan) is mainly composed of LAm2 and limited LAm1 and LAm3 associations. Similar facies associations and sedimentary models have been described in the north margin of the central Ebro Basin (e.g., Hirst and Nichols, 1986; Nichols and Hirst, 1998; Arenas et al., 2001; Yuste et al., 2004; Luz\u00f3n, 2005). In this study, three well sections have been built for the upper Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation (Section 1 and Section 2) and the lower Solsona Formation (Section 3) to analyse the distribution of the identified lithofacies associations (Fig. 6\n). The locations of the stratigraphic logs used for correlations are displayed in Fig. 7A. The upper Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation mainly consists of LAp1, LAp2 and LAm1 lithofacies associations. LAp1 and LAp2 associations decrease significantly from upper log C to upper log H (west to east) and from upper log I to upper log B1 (north to south), which were replaced by LAm1 (Fig. 7B). The Solsona Formation mainly consists of LAm1, LAm2 and LAm3 lithofacies associations. LAm1 association decreases from lower log B2 to middle log G (west to east) and is gradually replaced by LAm2 and LAm3 associations (Fig. 7B). The distribution of lithofacies associations in the Puig reig anticline (Figs. 6, 7) indicates a proximal to medial fluvial system with an overall south-east downstream trend.

(2010) also indicate a south-east downstream direction (Fig. 7C).\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nReservoir characteristics\nBased on Folk's (1980) sandstone classification scheme, all sandstone samples of the studied area plot within the litharenite field, with lithic content ranging from 60% to 90%, quartz content ranging from 5% to 30%, and very limited feldspar content (Fig. 8A). Based on Zuffa's (1980) classification scheme of hybrid arenites, these samples mainly plot in the carbonate extrarenite field with a minority that plot in the non-carbonate extrarenite field (Fig. 8B). The content of carbonate extrabasinal grains mainly ranges from 40% to 70%, while the content of non-carbonate extrabasinal grains, including non-carbonate lithic, quartz, feldspar, mainly ranges from 30% to 60%. The proximal fluvial fan has a slightly higher content of carbonate extrabasinal grains, compared to the medial fluvial fan. However, as can be seen in Fig. 8, no portion of the fan has a distinctive compositional signature with overlap between the different samples.\nCalcite is the dominant cement in the intergranular porosity of the fluvial deposits. Two generations of calcite cements have been identified based on petrographic observations. The first generation only filled a very limited fraction of intergranular porosity. This cement generally precipitated along clast edges and presents non-luminescent to bright luminescent zonation under cathodoluminescence (Fig. 9A, B). The second generation occluded most intergranular pores of all lithofacies across different structural units of the anticline, and present homogeneously bright orange luminescence (Fig. 9C, D). This cement filled the residual intergranular pores where Cc0 precipitated along clast edges (Fig. 9A, B), indicating that it developed after the first generation. The percentage content of calcite cement mainly ranges from 5% to 16% (Fig. 10\n), with around 95% of the measured samples located in this range and an average value of 11.6%. Cement content shows a variation across the different lithofacies, where sandstone lithofacies show slightly higher cement content compared to conglomerate and fine-grained lithofacies. Due to intensive calcite cementation, only limited intergranular pores remained open, resulting in an overall low porosity of the fluvial deposits. Intergranular porosity mainly ranges from 0% to 2% (Fig. 10), with around 85% of the measured samples located in this range and an average value of 1.1%. Limited samples present relatively high porosity concentrated in lithofacies Sch and Sm in the crest, crest-limb transition zones and south limb of the anticline, mainly ranging from 2% to 8% (Fig. 10). There is no clear correlation between cement content and porosity (Fig. 11A).\nOriginal porosity of different lithologies was calculated based on the Trask sorting coefficient data of fluvial to deltaic sediments of the Huagang Formation in the Xihu Depression (Table 2\n; Sun, 2018). The sorting coefficient of siltstone and sandstone mainly ranges from 1.3 to 2.3, resulting in original porosity between 31% and 39% with an average of around 35%. The sorting coefficient of conglomerate mainly ranges from 1.6 to 2.6, resulting in original porosity between 30% and 35% with an average of around 32%. Calcite cementation and compaction are the most significant diagenetic processes affecting porosity evolution of the fluvial deposits in the Puig-reig anticline. Original porosity destroyed by cementation mainly ranges from 20% to 50%, whereas that destroyed by compaction mainly ranges from 40% to 80% (Fig. 12A, B). Limited samples with relatively high porosity concentrate in Sch and Sm lithofacies and have porosity destroyed by cementation and compaction mainly ranging from 30% to 50% and from 40% to 60%, respectively (Fig. 12A).\nFracture intensity data was obtained from previous research in the Puig-reig anticline (Sun et al., 2021b). Fine-grained lithofacies tend to experience intensive weathering, erosion and pedogenesis and thus impede the identification of fracture attributes in these layers. Thus, fracture attributes were only measured in conglomerate and sandstone lithofacies using the linear scanline method (Fig. 2C). Fracture intensity mainly ranges from 0.5\u202fm\u22121 to 2.5\u202fm\u22121 and varies significantly across different structural units of the anticline (Fig. 10). The anticline crest and crest-limb transition zones have higher values than the south and north limbs. Fig. 11B shows a clear negative correlation between fracture intensity and distance to the anticline hinge. In the same structural unit, fracture intensity also varies significantly in different lithofacies. Sandstone lithofacies present higher values than conglomerate lithofacies in the anticline crest, crest-limb transition zones and north limb (Fig. 10). In the south limb, Sl has higher fracture intensity than Sch and Sm lithofacies. In addition, Fig. 11C shows a clear negative correlation between fracture intensity and bed thickness.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nFluvial fan sedimentary environments\nPrevious studies interpreted the whole Berga Group as alluvial fan deposits that wedge out into fluvial fan deposits of the Solsona Formation (Williams et al., 1998; Barrier et al., 2010). However, here we focus on the analysis of the Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation of the Berga Group and the Solsona Formation in the Puig-reig anticline. They are interpreted as deposited from a proximal-medial fluvial system, based on the comprehensive analyses of the drainage basin, fan size and sedimentary characteristics and the comparison to other similar sedimentary systems in the central Ebro Basin (Hirst and Nichols, 1986; Arenas, 1993; Nichols and Hirst, 1998; Arenas et al., 2001; Luz\u00f3n, 2005).\nAlluvial fan deposits are sourced by areal-limited drainage basins and are dominated by sheetflood and debris flow processes, whereas fluvial fan deposits tend to have larger drainage basins with long-term expansion and integration of catchments and channelised streams developing on the system (Moscariello, 2018; Ventra and Clarke, 2018). The Camps de Vall-Llonga and Solsona deposits are composed of polygenic clasts, including both carbonate and non-carbonate clasts (Fig. 8B). As noted by Riba (1976), the non-carbonate clasts of acid-intermediate plutonic rocks, Permo-Triassic red beds, Carboniferous micro-conglomerates, rare metasedimentary rocks and basic igneous rocks, all come from the basement of the Pyrenean Axial Zone. The varied carbonate clasts reflect source areas in the Mesozoic-Cenozoic series of the south Pyrenean thrust sheets and the Pyrenean Axial zone (Devonian carbonates). The polygenic compositions reveal the drainage basin of the Camps de Vall-Llonga and Solsona deposits extending from the south Pyrenean thrust sheets to the Pyrenean Axial Zone, which is consistent with the large and regional-scale drainage basin of fluvial deposits.\nAlluvial fans may range widely in radial length, rarely up to 10\u202fkm in exceptional circumstances favouring particularly long runout for sediment-water mixtures (Blair, 2003), but the radial fans extent generally varies from several hundred metres to a few kilometres at most (Blair and McPherson, 1994a; Moscariello, 2018). The Camps de Vall-Llonga deposits spread over a large area from the Vallfogona thrust to the Puig-reig anticline. The Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation is exposed for around 9\u202fkm in the direction perpendicular to the Vallfogona thrust and for around 20\u202fkm in a direction roughly parallel to the thrust based on the studied outcrops and the regional geological map of the study area (Institut Cartogr\u00e0fic i Geol\u00f2gic de Catalunya, 2006). Considering the folding of strata and the unexposed strata to the south, the actual extent of the Camps de Vall-Llonga deposits should be larger than the observable extent, which is larger than that of typical alluvial fans. There has been much debate regarding how alluvial fans are distinguished from distributive (fluvial) fan systems (Ventra and Clarke, 2018). In reality, there is likely a continuum between the two systems that the Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation sits close to. However, its regional drainage basin, fan size and prevalence of channelised facies indicate that they are the deposits of a distributive fluvial system (fluvial fan).\nIn the northwest portion of the study area, the Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation is dominated by the proximal deposits from flash floods and wide-shallow channel streams. The development of flash floods in the proximal fluvial fans is also documented in the marginal fluvial fans of the central Ebro Basin (Luz\u00f3n, 2001, 2005). The channel fill deposits within flash flood conglomerates may have formed during the waning stages of flood events or developed on fan surfaces by later confined flow events (Blair and McPherson, 1994a; Nichols and Hirst, 1998). The rest of the Camps de Vall-Llonga Formation is dominated by the medial deposits from braided channel streams and overbank areas. They tend to present an overall fining-upward trend from channel fill conglomerates and sandstones to overbank fine deposits, representing cyclic (avulsive) behaviour of the system as it developed through time. In the crest-south limb transition zone of the Puig-reig anticline, the Solsona Formation is still dominated by channel fill and overbank deposits. There are no perceptible differences of sedimentary environments in the transition area between the Camps de Vall-Llonga and Solsona formations, i.e., the contact between the lower log B1 and the upper log B2 (Fig. 6). In the south limb, conglomerate channel lags are gradually replaced by (pebbly) sandstone channel lags, i.e., in the upper log B2 and the middle log G (Fig. 6). In addition, the south limb features the occasional lateral accretion of channels (Fig. 4F) and the increasing proportion of overbank areas due to less powerful discharges in the relatively distal areas. These characteristics probably indicate the gradual transition from braided channel streams to meandering channel streams, as documented in the marginal fluvial systems of the central Ebro Basin (Arenas et al., 2001; Luz\u00f3n, 2005). We interpret that these deposits still belong to the medial portion of the fluvial system. This is mainly because of a lack of the terminal deposits of distal fluvial fan and the lacustrine sedimentary characteristics that have been described by S\u00e1ez et al. (2007) in the relatively central area of the eastern Ebro Basin. The Camps de Vall-Llonga and Solsona formations therefore represent mappable units rather than distinct separate sedimentary systems. The distal fluvial deposits can be found 20\u202fkm south of our study area. Deposits here represent terminal lobes during low lake-level stages and fluvial-dominated deltas and interdistributary bays during high lake level stages (S\u00e1ez et al., 2007), which grade into evaporites and calcareous lacustrine strata near the basin centre (Del Santo et al., 2000). Based on the data measured in the Sant Lloren\u00e7 de Morunys area (Williams et al., 1998; Barrier et al., 2010), palaeocurrents of the Berga Group are roughly directed towards the south to the southeast (Fig. 7C). The decrease of lithofacies associations dominated by conglomerate lithofacies and the increase of lithofacies associations dominated by sandstone and fine-grained lithofacies towards the southeast (Figs. 6, 7) are consistent with the overall palaeocurrents of the Berga Group, supporting the interpretation of the proximal to medial fluvial system.\nHowever, we do not discard the possibility of several alluvial fans developing during the deposition of the Berga Group, which are restricted at the northern basin margin with small fan size and local drainage basins, e.g., the small stream-flow and gravity-flow-dominated alluvial fan identified by Barrier et al. (2010) at the top of Berga Group and located to the northwest in Fig. 1D. This has been observed to be the case in the northern margin of the central Ebro Basin where two distributive systems (the Luna and Huesca fluvial systems) coincide and interfinger with a series of marginal alluvial fans (Hirst and Nichols, 1986; Nichols and Hirst, 1998; Arenas et al., 2001; Luz\u00f3n, 2005).\n\n\n5.2\nReservoir potential of the folded fluvial succession in the Puig-reig anticline\nBased on the distribution of calcite cement, intergranular porosity, fracture intensity and lithofacies characteristics in the Puig-reig anticline, we discuss the controlling factors of reservoir quality and the reservoir potential of the folded fluvial succession in the Puig-reig anticline in the SE Pyrenees.\nReservoir porosity is mainly controlled by the sedimentary characteristics of the deposits and the diagenetic processes they experience (Dos Anjos et al., 2000; Bj\u00f8rlykke, 2014). In the Puig-reig anticline, two generations of calcite cement filling the intergranular porosity of the fluvial deposits have been identified. The luminescent zonation of the first-generation cement (Fig. 9A, B) indicates fluctuations of the redox conditions probably in the meteoric phreatic environment (Muchez et al., 1998; Machel, 2000). It is inferred that the earliest cement along the edges of the fluvial clasts precipitated from the meteoric phreatic environment at the early diagenetic stage. The second-generation cement occluded most intergranular pores, becoming the most dominant cement and resulting in an overall low porosity of the fluvial deposits (Fig. 9C, D). Based on the high temperatures observed in the clumped isotope data (92\u202f\u00b0C to 129\u202f\u00b0C), this cement was previously interpreted as being precipitated from external hydrothermal fluids (Cruset et al., 2016). It is inferred that the hydrothermal fluids migrated from the internal and deeper parts of the SE Pyrenees through connected thrusts and fracture networks during thrusting and folding. In the Puig-reig anticline, the fluvial deposits present an overall low porosity due to intensive compaction and calcite cementation, but which varies across the different lithofacies (Fig. 12). Relatively high porosity concentrates in lithofacies Sch and Sm in the medial fluvial fan, regardless of their relatively higher cement contents with respect to other lithofacies (Fig. 10). Compared to lithofacies Sl and F, Sch and Sm have lower contents of ductile matrix (Fig. 9C\u2013F) due to deposited from more powerful discharges. Based on the original porosity of sandstone and siltstone (35% on average), the porosity destroyed by compaction of lithofacies Sch and Sm mainly ranges from 40% to 70% with 57% on average, whereas that of lithofacies Sl and F mainly ranges from 55% to 75% with 63% on average and from 60% to 85% with 73% on average, respectively (Fig. 12A). Compared to conglomeratic lithofacies, Sch and Sm present better grain sorting and lower matrix contents, thus resulting in relatively higher original and residual porosity. Based on the original porosity of conglomerate (32% on average), the porosity destroyed by compaction of conglomeratic lithofacies is higher than 50%, with 64% on average (Fig. 12B). Lithofacies Sch and Sm experience relatively weaker compaction, resulting in more residual intergranular volume which can provide more space for cementation and residual porosity. This is the main reason for the coexistence of relatively high residual porosity and calcite content in lithofacies Sch and Sm.\nBased on the systematic analysis of fracture networks, the fracture distribution patterns in the Puig-reig anticline and their controlling factors have been recently studied by Sun et al. (2021b). The crest and crest-limb transition zones present relatively higher fracture intensity due to the greater curvature and finite strain they experience compared to the limbs (Figs. 10, 11B), if a Tangential Longitudinal Strain model (TLS) is assumed (Hudleston and Treagus, 2010). This observation is consistent with some previous studies of fracture distribution in folds (e.g., I\u00f1igo et al., 2012; Awdal et al., 2013; Watkins et al., 2015). If flexural slip was the dominant folding mechanism, then thin and soft layers in limbs would be ones subjected to the highest strain. However, our field data better matches the first option because the anticline crest features more intensive fracturing than the limbs. Relatively thinner sandstone layers tend to present higher fracture intensity than thick conglomerate layers in all structural positions (Figs. 10, 11C). This is also consistent with some previous fracture studies that have revealed a negative correlation between fracture intensity and bed thickness (e.g., Florez-Ni\u00f1o et al., 2005; Wennberg et al., 2007). In addition, in the case of the same structural position and bed thickness, fracture intensity is also affected by lithofacies assemblage. For example, in the anticline crest massive sandstone with similar bed thickness present slightly different distributions of fracture spacing in different lithofacies assemblages. Sandstone layers with multiple fine-grained interlayers (Layer 1) show relatively smaller fracture spacing and thus higher fracture intensity than sandstone layers in between thick conglomerate bodies (Layer 2) and those in between thick fine-grained deposits (Layer 3) (Fig. 13\n) (Sun et al., 2021b). Layer 1 features the high competence contrast between competent sandstones and incompetent fine-grained deposits, which favours the development of joints or faults. In contrast, Layer 2 has relatively low competence contrast between competent sandstones and conglomerates. Although Layer 3 also features high competence contrast, thick incompetent fine-grained deposits are capable of accommodating greater amounts of pre-failure strain (Ferrill and Morris, 2008). Using multiple linear regression analysis, the relative importance of each controlling factor for controlling fracture intensity has been unravelled (Sun et al., 2021b). Fracture intensity is mainly controlled by the structural position related to the anticline hinge and is also simultaneously affected by bed thickness and lithofacies assemblage. Lithofacies Sl and Sm with multiple thin fine-grained interlayers in the medial fluvial fan and located in the high strain zones of the anticline feature relatively higher fracture intensity than other structural units and lithofacies assemblages.\nBased on the distribution of lithofacies, calcite cement, porosity and fracture intensity, Fig. 14\n shows a schematic diagram that summarises the sedimentary characteristics and reservoir quality of the Puig-reig anticline. In the crest and crest-limb transition zones the medial fluvial sandstones present relatively greater potential to be effective reservoirs due to the high fracture intensity (1\u20133.5\u202fm\u22121). The north limb presents relatively high percentages of sandstone and conglomerate deposits and lower percentages of fine-grained deposits. However, these sandstone and conglomerate deposits have low potential to become effective reservoirs due to their low porosity (<1.5%) and fracture intensity (<1.2\u202fm\u22121). In the south limb the medial fluvial sandstones have relatively low fracture intensity (<1.5\u202fm\u22121), but present some reservoir potential in Sch and Sm lithofacies due to relatively high porosity (3.9% on average).\n\n\n5.3\nReservoir potential of folded alluvial-fluvial successions at foreland basin margins\nAs one of the dominant sedimentary systems at the active margins of non-marine foreland basins, alluvial and fluvial fans tend to present heterogeneous reservoir potential due to the interplay between complex sedimentary, diagenetic and deformation processes. Unravelling their reservoir characteristics is therefore key to the success of subsurface operations.\nCompared to fluvial fans, alluvial fans present radial-limited fan extent (Blair and McPherson, 1994a). Debris-flow alluvial fans tend to present poor primary reservoir quality due to texturally immature debris deposited from debris flows and hyperconcentrated flows. These deposits have varied reservoir connectivity depending on their abundance in local sedimentary systems (Moscariello, 2018). On the other hand, water-lain alluvial fans, generally dominated by sheet floods, have better reservoir potential due to the presence of relatively better sorted deposits and reservoir connectivity (Moscariello, 2005). At basin margins, proximal fluvial deposits tend to consist of amalgamated channel belts with limited preservation of overbank deposits (Weissmann et al., 2013). Thick conglomerate bodies can occur in proximal fluvial deposits (Vincent, 2002), which can be associated with channelised non-cohesive gravity or hyperconcentrated flows (Moscariello, 2018). Besides, flash floods can develop in these proximal fluvial environments, e.g., in the Puig-reig anticline and other cases (Luz\u00f3n, 2001, 2005), resulting in large and coarse sheet-like deposits. Compared to debris-flow alluvial fans, these proximal fluvial deposits can have high reservoir potential due to their higher textural maturity and better reservoir connectivity. Basinwards, medial deposits of fluvial fans mainly consist of channel belts separated by varied overbank fine deposits. Although these fluvial deposits present a downstream reduction of net reservoirs and a corresponding increase of overbank deposits, they are still dominated by conglomerate or sandstone reservoirs at basin margins and present better textural maturity resulting in better primary reservoir quality. These water-lain alluvial fans and proximal-medial fluvial fans present high potential to be effective reservoirs without undergoing strong compaction and cementation.\nIntensive diagenesis can result in low porosity and permeability, and thus reduce the reservoir potential in alluvial-fluvial deposits (Morad et al., 2010; Lai et al., 2018). Carbonate cement is one of the prevailing authigenic minerals in these deposits (Hall et al., 2004; Taylor and Machent, 2011). In tectonically active settings, such as foreland basin margins, carbonate extrabasinal grains can become important sediments in alluvial-fluvial systems (Valloni and Zuffa, 1984; Morad et al., 2010). This is because such settings provide short time and distance for sediment transportation and exposure, thus resulting in relatively weak chemical weathering of these carbonate compositions (Zuffa, 1985). These extrabasinal carbonate grains can provide the material source for calcite cement by dissolution and favour the growth of carbonate cement by providing favourable nucleation substrates (Walderhaug and Bj\u00f8rkum, 1998; Mansurbeg et al., 2009). In addition, at foreland basin margins, intensive fracturing, thrusting and folding are accompanied with fluid flow of various external geological fluids including hydrothermal, meteoric and formation fluids (Trav\u00e9 et al., 1997, 2000, 2007; Cruset et al., 2018, 2020). Connected fracture networks allow fluid migration across different hydrostratigraphic units (Evans and Fischer, 2012; Evans et al., 2012). These fluids can provide material sources and physical-chemical conditions from which cement precipitates (Bons et al., 2012). Thus, intensive carbonate cementation can result in an overall or localised low porosity of alluvial-fluvial deposits at basin margins, e.g., the Peraltilla and Sari\u00f1ena formations in the central Ebro Basin (Yuste et al., 2004), the Berga Group and the Solsona Formation in the eastern Ebro Basin (Cruset et al., 2016), the Siwalik Group in the Himalayan Basin (Guilbaud et al., 2012), and the Wuqia Group and the Artux Formation in the south-western Tarim Basin (Zheng et al., 2006).\nAt foreland basin margins, fracture networks are widely developed accompanied with intensive deformation in fold-and-thrust belts (I\u00f1igo et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017). These fracture networks can play a fundamental role both in fluid migration and the resulting reservoir quality, especially in reservoirs with low intergranular porosity and permeability (Casini et al., 2011; Watkins et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020). Fracture intensity can be controlled by multiple factors in folded sedimentary successions, mainly including the structural position and the sedimentary characteristic. Fracture intensity and connectivity tend to be higher in high strain fold crests or forelimbs, such as in the cases of the Puig-reig anticline in the South-eastern Pyrenees (Sun et al., 2021b), the Achnashellach Culmination in the Southern Moine Thrust Belt (Watkins et al., 2015), or the Sub-Andean fold-thrust belt (I\u00f1igo et al., 2012). In alluvial-fluvial deposits, variable sedimentary characteristics can exert significant effects on fracture intensity. Fracture intensity tends to present a negative correlation with bed thickness (Huang and Angelier, 1989; Florez-Ni\u00f1o et al., 2005). In addition, fracture intensity is also affected by lithofacies assemblages. Fractures tend to develop at the interfaces of distinct mechanical stratigraphic positions due to the high competence contrast (Sibson, 1996; Wilkins et al., 2014), such as at the interfaces between conglomerate or sandstone layers and fine-grained layers. Proximal fluvial deposits are dominated by large and thick conglomerate bodies and interlayered sandstones with limited fine-grained deposits. Thus, the large bed thickness and the relatively low competence contrast between conglomerate layers or between conglomerate and sandstone layers can result in relatively low fracture intensity. In contrast, medial fluvial deposits are dominated by channel bodies with variable overbank fine deposits. The relatively high competence contrast between conglomerate or sandstone layers and fine-grained layers can favour the fracture development. Besides, in the medial fluvial fan, sandstones tend to have higher fracture intensity than conglomerate bodies due to their relatively thinner bed thickness. Fracture networks can significantly improve reservoir potential in tight conglomerate and sandstone reservoirs at foreland basin margins (Watkins et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2021b).\nIn summary, compared to deposits in basin centre localities where reservoir quality is mainly controlled by depositional and diagenetic characteristics, basin proximal reservoirs in foreland basins are most likely to be tectonically deformed and feature variable fracture networks. Intergranular porosity is mainly controlled by primary depositional characteristics and subsequent diagenetic alteration. Fracture networks are mainly controlled by depositional characteristics and structural position. In the right circumstances, an effective combination of both structure and facies can make basin margin locations potential areas for effective reservoirs, even in the case of low porosity.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe lithofacies and sedimentary facies of the folded fluvial succession in the Puig-reig anticline (SE Pyrenees) have been analysed to explore the reservoir potential in the studied anticline and other similar systems at foreland basin margins. Based on a comprehensive analysis of lithofacies, porosity, cement and fracture intensity distribution, the following conclusions can be highlighted:\n\n(1)\nThe Camps de Vall-Llonga and Solsona formations in the Puig-reig anticline were deposited as part of proximal to medial deposits of a fluvial fan system. The proximal deposits in the study area are characterised by unconfined flash floods and wide-shallow channel streams. They are dominated by thick and large sheet-like conglomerate bodies with minor interlayered sandstones, and mainly spread in the north limb of the anticline. The medial deposits are characterised by braided to meandering channel streams and overbank areas, dominated by the interbedded conglomerates, sandstones and claystones, which finally change to terminal deposits in the distal portion close to the basin centre.\n\n\n(2)\nThe fluvial deposits present overall low intergranular porosity due to intensive compaction and calcite cementation, with relatively high porosity developed in Sm and Sch lithofacies in the medial fluvial fan. Fracture intensity is mainly affected by structural position, bed thickness and lithofacies assemblage. The relatively higher values developed in sandstone lithofacies in the medial fluvial fan and located in the high strain zones of the anticline. Sandstone lithofacies deposited in the medial fluvial fan and located in the crest and crest-limb transition zones presents relatively higher potential to be effective reservoirs.\n\n\n(3)\nThe comprehensive analysis of the Puig-reig anticline can provide an effective analogue for the exploration of subsurface reservoirs. The comparison with other similar settings worldwide shows reservoir potential is comprehensively controlled by sedimentology, diagenesis and deformation at foreland basin margins. An effective combination of both structure and facies can make basin margin locations potential areas for effective reservoirs, even in the case of low intergranular porosity.\n\n\n\n\n","117":"","118":"","119":""},"Creator":{"0":["Li, Xiaowei","Lehrmann, Daniel J.","Luczaj, John","Kelley, Brian M.","Cantrell, Dave L.","Yu, Meiyi","Ferrill, Nathaniel Ledbetter","Payne, Jonathan L."],"1":["Ineson, Jon R.","Lauridsen, Bodil W.","Lode, Stefanie","Sheldon, Emma","S\u00f8rensen, Henning O.","Wisshak, Max","Anderskouv, Kresten"],"2":["Reolid, J.","Aguirre, J.","P\u00e9rez-Asensio, J.N.","Puga-Bernab\u00e9u, \u00c1.","Braga, J.C.","Mart\u00edn, J.M."],"3":["Huang, Heran","Liu, Yudong","Yang, Yibo","Yang, Rongsheng","Ye, Chengcheng","Appel, Erwin","Fang, Xiaomin","Liu, Xiaoming"],"4":["Yang, Tianbo","Azmy, Karem","He, Zhiliang","Li, Shuangjian","Liu, Entao","Wu, Shitou","Wang, Jingbin","Li, Tianyi","Gao, Jian"],"5":["Zhou, Xiqiang","Li, Run","Tang, Dongjie","Huang, Kang-Jun","Liu, Kang","Ding, Yi"],"6":["Wu, Qianran","Xian, Benzhong","Gao, Xianzhi","Bai, Qinglin","Wang, Zhen","Liu, Jianping","Chen, Peng","Li, Yuzhi","Rahman, Naveed Ur","Tian, Rongheng","Zhang, Wenmiao","Zhang, Haozhe"],"7":["Sanz-Montero, M.

Prediction of this phenomenon is generally conducted using models that are based on a two-dimensional pipe and flow pattern. However, the concentration of flow towards the pipe is essentially a three-dimensional phenomenon, causing model width and exit geometry to affect its progression. This paper presents the 3D simulation of backward erosion experiments on uniform sands using the Sellmeijer model, as a first step towards the development of a prediction model. The paper confirms that two-dimensional outlet configurations, such as a ditch or plane, which tend to result in the development of multiple pipes, can best be modelled using the existing two-dimensional model. For configurations in which flow converges to a single location, as often occurs in the field, three-dimensional modelling will be required. The study illustrates that three-dimensional modelling of backward erosion piping still presents challenges, such as the understanding of the erosion mechanism at the pipe tip, the numerical simulation of the pipe and the validation of models at a larger scale.\n               ","1":"\n                  Intensive seepage widely occurs due to seepage area constriction and local soil grading coarsening, which will mutually accelerate the suffusion process with greater particle loss and rapid soil structure changes. However, less research has focused on the quantitative impacts of the various intensive seepage degrees and locations on suffusion. This paper uses a verified one-dimensional model to theoretically simulate these impacts by considering two mechanisms: seepage area constriction and local soil grading coarsening. These two mechanisms are realized with gradual constricted seepage areas formed by external boundaries and coarsened soil grading of a specific layer with higher permeability. The results indicate that the two mechanisms can significantly accelerate the particle loss rate in suffusion. The acceleration is nonlinear, with the increasing proportion of the particle loss being much larger than the constriction rate. The outlet constriction causes a more extensive increase in particle movement than the midlayer constriction in the whole soil column, with the particle loss increasing by many times in most layers under the 50% constriction. Local soil grading coarsening promotes particle loss in the upstream layers. The midlayer coarsening causes a greater violence of suffusion than the outlet coarsening by serving as another outlet for particle loss. Midlayer coarsening may lead to stronger particle movement and a severalfold soil permeability increase. Intensive seepage can further promote heterogeneous development and the upward erosion of the suffusion process and then contribute to the formation of preferential paths.\n               ","2":"\n                  Water leakage is one of the most critical factors that affect the ground movement and structural behaviour during and after the construction of the shield tunnel. Currently, very limited attention has been paid to the effect of the loss of fine particles induced by the water leakage, namely the internal erosion. In this study, the evolution of soil porosity, gradation, seepage flow and the induced ground movement and lining stress change due to tunnel leakage has been numerically investigated using a novel coupled hydro-mechanical approach formulated within the continuous porous medium framework. The detachment and transport of fines particles within the seepage flow are considered by a four-constituent model of internal erosion. The induced influence on the soil mechanical behaviour is modelled by a critical-state-based constitutive model considering the evolution of the fines content. Using the proposed approach, the time\u2013space evolution of the eroded zone and the hydro-mechanical response in the cases of a single tunnel and two crossing tunnels are identified. The results indicate that the commonly used pore pressure reduction-based method without considering internal erosion will under-estimate the leakage induced lining stress change and ground movement. Moreover, the influence of three-dimensional conditions, hydraulic boundary conditions and tunnel characteristics are highlighted.\n               ","3":"\n                  Accurate modeling of subsurface flow and transport processes is vital as the prevalence of subsurface activities such as carbon sequestration, geothermal recovery, and nuclear waste disposal increases. Computational modeling of these problems leverages poroelasticity theory, which describes coupled fluid flow and mechanical deformation. Although fully coupled monolithic schemes are accurate for coupled problems, they can demand significant computational resources for large problems. In this work, a fixed stress scheme is implemented into the Sandia Sierra Multiphysics toolkit. Two implementation methods, along with the fully coupled method, are verified with one-dimensional (1D) Terzaghi, 2D Mandel, and 3D Cryer sphere benchmark problems. The impact of a range of material parameters and convergence tolerances on numerical accuracy and efficiency was evaluated. Overall the fixed stress schemes achieved acceptable numerical accuracy and efficiency compared to the fully coupled scheme. However, the accuracy of the fixed stress scheme tends to decrease with low permeable cases, requiring the finer tolerance to achieve a desired numerical accuracy. For the fully coupled scheme, high numerical accuracy was observed in most of cases except a low permeability case where an order of magnitude finer tolerance was required for accurate results. Finally, a two-layer Terzaghi problem and an injection\u2013production well system were used to demonstrate the applicability of findings from the benchmark problems for more realistic conditions over a range of permeability. Simulation results suggest that the fixed stress scheme provides accurate solutions for all cases considered with the proper adjustment of the tolerance. This work clearly demonstrates the robustness of the fixed stress scheme for coupled poroelastic problems, while a cautious selection of numerical tolerance may be required under certain conditions with low permeable materials.\n               ","4":"\n                  To enable safe geological storage of high-level radioactive waste, a comprehensive understanding of the overall system must include relevant physical processes, geological and geotechnical boundary conditions. In the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory (Switzerland) the Cyclic Deformation (CD-A) experiment has been established with the excavation of the two twin niches in the year 2019. To study the impact of the different climatic conditions on the hydraulic and mechanical processes in the claystone, an extensive investigation program has been carried out. As part of the CD-A experiment, we present here a multidisciplinary interpretation including geological characterisation, geodetic and geotechnical measurements, numerical modelling and visualisation techniques. The period under consideration runs between September 2019 and March 2021. Geological mappings illustrate different zones of tectonically induced faulted rock in the sandy facies of the Opalinus Clay and laserscans conducted at regular intervals show small convergence of the niches. While the deformation around the open niche tends to continue, extensometer measurements around the closed twin indicate a reduced deformation after the first months. First coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical simulations demonstrate that the numerical approach is capable of reproducing the hydro-mechanical behaviour qualitatively, including the extent of the desaturated zone. The application of state-of-the-art visualisation techniques allows simultaneous evaluation and comparison of geological features, measurements and simulation results. This holistic approach \u2013 discussed here exemplary for the mechanical effects \u2013 provides a valuable basis for the rating of the impact of geologic structures, material heterogeneities, and climatic conditions on the Opalinus Clay. Thus, it can be a valuable component for the safe construction and operation of a repository and for the long term safety assessment.\n               ","5":"\n                  Backward erosion piping (BEP) is a type of internal erosion responsible for the failure of many dams and levees. BEP occurs when small, shallow erosion channels progress upstream through foundation sands beneath the structure. As analysis of BEP involves coupling two different sets of flow equations to describe the groundwater flow and erosion pipe flow, the solution contains a singularity in the gradient field at the juncture of the soil and pipe domains. In addition, the erosion process is highly localized, often occurring over length scales of 1\u00a0cm or less. While it is well known that singularities and localized phenomena cause high errors in numerical solutions, there has been no assessment of the magnitude of these errors in BEP numerical models. This study evaluates the magnitude of error in BEP finite element models through comparison of numerical results to measurements from a highly instrumented BEP experiment.

More precisely, during suffusion three processes simultaneously take place: detachment, transport and possible filtration of the fine particles. This paper proposes a new relationship to describe the development of suffusion based on the energy approach. The proposed relationship is a power law that relates the volumetric cumulative eroded mass with the volumetric cumulative energy dissipated by the flow. This law requires three material parameters: the erosion resistance index and the maximum volumetric cumulative energy that both characterize the fully-eroded state; and a smoothing time that controls the suffusion kinetics. The first two parameters are being measured from a series of experimental tests performed in oedometric conditions. The experimental program was set up to study suffusion development on three different soils and along three seepage lengths. The erosion resistance index was found to be insensitive to the seepage length. On the other hand, the maximum volumetric cumulative energy tends to increase with the seepage length. This increase is being attributed to the transport and filtration phenomena. The cumulative eroded mass predicted by the energy-based relationship compares reasonably well with the experimental data, by fitting for each test a fixed smoothing time. To improve our physical understanding of the suffusion kinetics, a relationship between the smoothing time and the hydraulic diffusion time is postulated in accordance with experimental observations. Such hypothesis improves the cumulative eroded mass predictions.\n               ","9":"\n                  An injection test and repeated packer tests were conducted for a fault in siliceous mudstone in order to activate the fault and investigate changes in hydraulic connectivity of the fault before and after fault activation. The injection test successfully induced a significant dilational shear failure within the fault. Pressure changes measured by the repeated packer tests were analyzed before and after the failure, where log-log plots of the pressure derivatives changed after the failure from an upward trend indicating a limited extent of fluid flow paths to a horizontal trend suggesting well-connected fluid flow paths. After the borehole had been open for six weeks, the pressure derivatives were restored to an upward trend. This reversible change in pressure derivatives means that the hydraulic connectivity of the fault increased temporarily during and just after the injection test, but fault activation did not irreversibly affect the initially low hydraulic connectivity of the fault. This transition in the hydraulic connectivity of the fault is also consistent with the variation in fluid pressure monitored at a neighboring observation hole. We propose that analyzing the pressure derivatives obtained by repeated packer tests before and after an injection test in a single borehole is effective for assessing the sensitivity of the hydraulic disconnectivity of faults to fault activation, which is key information for risk assessment of radioactive waste disposal.\n               ","10":"\n                  A series of tests were conducted to study the thermal shock damage effect on the physical and mechanical properties of granite and limestone in different cooling media.

Borehole breakout is a progressive failure process controlled by multiple factors. Identifying the main factors that control borehole breakout is critical for successful drilling. This paper proposes a coupled geomechanics and fluid flow model for evaluating borehole breakout in fractured rocks, using a distinct element method. The model considers anisotropic drilling fluid invasion within natural fractures. The effect of in-situ stress, fracture density, fracture orientation, fluid dynamic viscosity, and joint strength on borehole breakout was investigated. The simulation results show that the fracture density dominates the yielded area around the borehole, while the direction of the fractures controls the shape of the breakout. With the increase of open-hole time and decrease in dynamic viscosity, the magnitude of borehole breakout increases due to increasing fluid invasion from the wellbore to the surrounding formation. The impacts of the above factors are demonstrated using numerical examples.

PetroChina\u2019s Hutubi (HTB) gas storage site is located in the west gate of China\u2019s west\u2013east gas pipeline project. Multiple major faults intersect the gas storage reservoir and caprock, which pose safety concerns for increasing the gas storage pressure. The typical practice in an HTB storage site has been to operate gas storage pressures at levels equal to the original reservoir pressure because of concerns related to caprock integrity and fault stability. To investigate the possibilities of increasing the gas storage pressure, a comprehensive geomechanical study has been conducted. By utilizing the data from rock mechanics laboratory testing, in-situ stress measurements, 3D field-specific geomechanical models, and coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulations, this paper presents probabilistic risk assessment of fault slippage in response to injection-related increases in pore pressure. Uncertainties of relevant geomechanical parameters, such as the frictional strengths of faults, orientation, and magnitudes of in-situ stresses, have been incorporated through Monte Carlo simulations. The authors find that: (1) fault slippage is the controlling factor which determines the limit of MOP at a HTB gas storage site; (2) increasing the gas storage pressure by 12.5% above the initial reservoir pressure (34.5 MPa) leads to approximately 0.6% probability of fault instability that could provide a leakage pathway. Thus, from a geomechanical perspective, operating the storage pressure at initial reservoir pressure at a HTB gas storage field is an overly conservative approach that leads to under-utilization of the existing storage capability. This paper provides the first integrative geomechanical study for increasing MOP for large underground gas storage reservoir in China.

The Lagrangian particle tracking method is applied to model the advective transport in the fracture after shearing. The results generally show that the shear displacements and the normal loading conditions can significantly affect flow patterns and advective travel time distributions in the fracture. For mated fractures, the flow and transport will be enhanced by the increasing shear displacement because of shear dilation. For cases with the same shear displacement, the median advective travel time increases with the increasing boundary normal stiffness.

Early warning systems based on accurate analyses of groundwater response to meteorological factors are widely used to mitigate landslide risk. In such a context, the accuracy of the model adopted to calculate the groundwater field is closely related to the reliability and meaningfulness of hydraulic soil characterization. In this paper, an extensive laboratory investigation regarding the hydraulic behaviour of pyroclastic unsaturated deposits from a vegetated slope monitored on Mount Faito (Campania, Southern Italy) is presented to highlight the importance of hydraulic hysteresis and the presence of roots in shallow soils. Water retention properties and hydraulic conductivity functions were determined, focusing on a drying\u2013wetting cycle. Tests on specimens sampled in the top ten centimetres of the soil profile were also carried out to assess the effects of plant roots on soil hydraulic properties. Inverse analyses were used to estimate the parameters of a hysteretic hydraulic model. Finally, parametric numerical analyses, carried out via a finite element code, were used to highlight the potential effects of the hydraulic characterization on the stability of sloping pyroclastic covers, including all above factors.\n               ","27":"\n                  This paper investigates proppant flow and transport in intersected fractures at angles typical for intersections of pre-existing and new hydraulic fractures.

This study uses plexiglas laboratory slot experiments enhanced with advanced image analysis for identifying particle trajectories and quantifying slurry velocities. Although proppant flow and transport have been broadly studied, the effects of intersecting fracture angles have not, especially coupled with fluid viscosities, flow rates, and proppant volumetric concentration effects.

Results show that proppant flow and transport behavior after the intersection is very sensitive to carrying fluid viscosity and flow rates alteration while differentiating proppant volumetric concentrations have a limited effect.

Enzyme induced carbonate precipitation (EICP) can improve the durability of earth materials without using traditional chemical binders such as cement and lime. EICP utilises the urease enzyme to catalyse the hydrolysis of urea, which produces carbonate ions that react with the calcium ions dissolved in the pore water, thus resulting in the precipitation of calcium carbonate. The calcium carbonate fills the soil voids and binds particles together, which reduces water permeability and increases material strength. The urease enzyme is a hexameric protein that is found in the tissues of many common plants. This work proposes a low-cost and simple stabilisation technology that makes use of crude urease enzyme extracted from soybeans. This technology is applied to the stabilisation of compacted earth, whose properties are then assessed via unconfined compression, moisture buffering and durability tests. The findings suggest a noticeable improvement of material strength and durability, though further investigation is necessary to increase the competitiveness of EICP stabilisation against standard techniques using cement and lime.\n               ","29":"\n                  Energy tunnels allow the harvesting of untapped heat at shallow depths in the underground to meet the thermal energy requirements of buildings and infrastructures over large areas. Such heat can derive from two sources: the ground surrounding energy tunnels and the air circulating in the environment internal to these tunnels. To date, various investigations have addressed the role of ground characteristics on the heat exchange potential of energy tunnels, as they significantly influence the amount of geothermal energy that these geostructures can harvest. Despite the comparable role of airflow characteristics on the amount of aerothermal energy that energy tunnels can harvest, no extensive analysis of this problem has been reported before this study. To fill in this knowledge gap, this paper investigates the heat exchange potential of energy tunnels for a broad range of internal airflow characteristics. From this perspective, the work specifically provides: (i) the first charts, validated against representative experimental evidence, summarizing the thermal power that energy tunnels can harvest per unit surface for different convection heat transfer coefficients and temperatures associated with internal airflows, as well as undisturbed temperatures and effective thermal conductivities of the ground; and (ii) the analysis of an energy tunnel at the regional scale, based on the application of the developed charts and the use of a large hydrogeological dataset. Based on the results of this study, it is concluded that the internal airflow characteristics significantly influence the harvesting of aerothermal energy through energy tunnels. Together with the ground characteristics, which can markedly vary along energy tunnel applications at the regional scale, internal airflow characteristics rule the thermal power that can be harvested through such heat exchangers, deserving thorough quantifications for any adequate energy performance assessment.\n               ","30":"\n                  Energy geostructures (EGs) represent an innovative technology in the sustainable energy agenda and are useful for satisfying the energy needs of the built environment.

The application of such technology to infrastructure projects may have considerable thermal potential because of the large surfaces that can be thermally activated. This study focuses on thermo-active walls (energy walls, EWs), which are retaining structures used to sustain the sides of excavations. Key features related to their thermal design are examined, and a design methodology is proposed. The heat-exchange modes involving EWs and the surrounding materials (concrete, soil, air) are investigated via extensive three-dimensional hydrothermal finite-element simulations involving the non-isothermal flow in the heat exchangers (HEs), as well as all other heat-exchange modes.

Water retention hysteresis has often been modelled using expressions for the main drying and main wetting water retention curves that are unsatisfactory at low values of degree of saturation. In addition, the effect of retention hysteresis on the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity behaviour has typically not been explicitly considered. This paper presents a new hysteretic hydraulic constitutive model for the water retention and hydraulic conductivity behaviour of unsaturated soils, which is effective and easy to apply. The model includes: (i) main wetting and main drying water retention curves modelled with a modified version of the van Genuchten model, improved at low degree of saturation; (ii) hysteretic scanning water retention curves modelled using a bounding surface approach; (iii) the effect of hydraulic hysteresis on a soil hydraulic conductivity curve (SHCC) model improved at low degree of saturation and including the effect of liquid film conductivity. The new hysteretic hydraulic model is then validated against experimental data. After implementation in the finite element software Code_Bright, the new hydraulic constitutive model is applied in a numerical study of the impact of hydraulic hysteresis on the behaviour of capillary barrier systems (CBSs). Water retention hysteresis, which has typically been neglected in the modelling of the hydraulic behaviour of CBSs, is shown to have a significant impact on: (i) movement and redistribution of water within the finer layer of a CBS; (ii) the phenomenon of water breakthrough across the interface between the finer and coarser layers of a CBS and the subsequent restoration of the CBS after infiltration at the ground surface ceases; (iii) the prediction of evaporation from a CBS into the atmosphere.\n               ","32":"\n                  This paper studies the possibility of harnessing renewable thermal energy from road pavement constructed using construction and demolition (C&D) materials in Australia. This research study aims to evaluate the efficiency and heat gain capacity of geothermal pavement system with constant inlet water temperature and closed-loop approach. An experimental model was developed using copper pipe and C&D materials as pavement structure and the tests were conducted during summer-time in Melbourne, Australia. Numerical computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation was used to study the capacity of simulation in modeling heat transfer and the temperature field in the geothermal pavement. The results showed that the geothermal pavement system with constant inlet water temperature can gain almost 450 (kJ\/m2) of thermal energy while subsequently decreasing the surface temperature of the pavement, hence increasing the service life of the geothermal pavement. The pipe burial depth of 40\u00a0mm to 60\u00a0mm was found to lead to the best efficiency of the geothermal pavement. The thermal efficiency of the geothermal pavement could increase and reach 25% during the day for a geothermal pavement system with constant inlet water temperature. Thermal conductivity and surface albedo would also increase the thermal efficiency of the system. Results showed that increasing thermal conductivity from 1 (W\/m.K) to 3.5 (W\/m.K) led to an increase in thermal efficiency from 20% to 34%. Also, increasing surface albedo magnitude equal to 0.1 would decrease efficiency by approximately 5%. The experimental results of the closed-loop geothermal pavement system demonstrated that the maximum hourly heat gain capacity of the system was 1000 (kJ\/m2), which is twice higher than this value for a system with a constant inlet water temperature. The thermal efficiency of geothermal pavement system increased to its peak value equal to 30% throughout the day.\n               ","33":"\n                  Over the last decades, converting foundation elements such as piles, retaining walls and tunnel linings into energy geo-structures has gained popularity around the world.

This work utilises experimental investigations in combination with numerical simulations to study the thermal performance of energy piled walls, specifically regarding the effect of thermo-active pile spacing. This knowledge can aid towards better design guidelines and the determination of the number of piles to be thermally activated in the wall system. The experimental results from a section of a pilot energy soldier piled wall in Melbourne (Australia) and the numerical results from a validated finite element model suggest that the thermal performance of piled walls can be significantly affected by close pile spacing. In addition, parametric analyses were performed to understand the role of some other key design parameters. The results indicate that the depth of the wall impacts the thermal performance of the GSHP system more significantly than the thermal conductivity of the ground. Considering a real-world scenario where a fixed number of piles are constructed for a typical building at relatively close spacings, one may increase the \u201cthermal\u201d pile spacing by activating less piles overall. It is found that activating every other pile (1\/2 of the total number of piles) or every other second pile (1\/3 of them) can still provide over 70% or 50%, respectively, of the maximum thermal energy compared to activating every pile.\n               ","34":"\n                  In the transition to a sustainable energy system, natural gas may be an interim source for relatively low-carbon energy production.

Reservoir compaction may potentially be mitigated by fluid injection. Fluid injection into porous subsurface reservoirs is also required in other technologies envisioned in a sustainable energy system, such as geothermal energy production and temporary storage of renewable energy. However, fluid injection into porous reservoirs may create a chemical disequilibrium between the pore fluid and host rock, potentially activating fluid\u2013rock interactions that can cause compaction of the reservoir.

Creep strain and acoustic emissions (AEs) accumulated with increasing stress and sample porosity. While saturation with supercritical fluids produced slightly less creep strain than dry conditions, flooding with distilled water doubled the creep strain. The acidic solutions inhibited compaction creep compared to distilled water saturation. AE activity and microstructural analysis revealed that microcracking controlled deformation, presumably via stress corrosion cracking. While the supercritical fluids may have dried crack tips, distilled water likely reduced the stress required for Si-O bond breakage. The acidic solutions inhibited microcracking through, presumably, a change in surface energy.

Water supply and wastewater collection pipes may be well suited for thermal energy applications being present in all urban areas in networks already in proximity to heat users. However, greater understanding of their potential interactions with surrounding heat sources and sinks is required before full assessment of the energy potential of such buried pipe networks can be obtained. This paper presents an investigation into the thermal interactions associated with shallow, buried water filled pipes. Using the results of large scale experiments and numerical simulation it is shown that soil surface ambient conditions and adjacent pipes can both act as sources or sinks of heat. While conduction is the main mechanism of heat transfer in the soil directly surrounding any pipe, any adjacent water filled pipes may lead to convection becoming important locally. In the test case, the thermal sphere of influence of the water filled pipe was also shown to be large, at in excess of 4\u00a0m over a timescale of 4 months. Taken together, these points suggest that design and analysis approaches when using water supply and wastewater collection networks for heat exchange and storage need careful consideration of environmental interactions, heat losses and gains to adjacent pipes or other infrastructure, and in ground conditions for a number of pipe diameters from any buried pipe.\n               ","36":"\n                  Little is known about the real energy potential of thermoactive underground infrastructures, such as railway stations, that can act as a heating\/cooling provider for the built environment.

The thermal performance and related geostructural impact of a portion of the new underground energy infrastructure (UEI) installed at the Lancy-Bachet train station in Geneva (Switzerland) are analyzed. Heating and cooling tests simulating real operative geothermal conditions are considered. Particular attention is given to (i) the monitored wall\u2013tunnel hydrothermal interactions, (ii) the thermal response of the UEI to heating\/cooling thermal inputs and (iii) the thermomechanical behavior of the energy geostructure. Among the main results of this study, it is shown how the hydrothermal tunnel behavior considerably varies on a seasonal basis, while the train circulation completely drives the airflow in the tunnel. The UEI shows a strong heat storage potential due to the main conductive heat transfers between the geostructure and soil, while lower heat fluxes are detected at the wall\u2013tunnel interface. The extraction potential is of lower magnitude with respect to storage because of the limited range of operative fluid temperatures and of the concurrent action of temperature variations at the tunnel boundaries affecting the materials within the UEI. Preliminary guidelines for the thermal response test execution on underground thermoactive infrastructures are also reported. The monitored thermomechanical behavior suggests different wall behaviors in the vertical and longitudinal directions. Low-magnitude strains are recorded, while the mechanical capacity of the existing geostructure can satisfactorily sustain concurrent thermomechanical actions.\n               ","37":"\n                  The kinetics of one-dimensional self-weight consolidation of dredged mud depends on the permeability and the compressibility of the mud, in addition to the height of the mud and the drainage conditions at the boundaries.

Finally, sensitivity analysis of the constitutive relations of the mud is carried out. The model reproduces quite well the evolution of the excess pore water pressure profile in the mud, while the rate of settlement of the mud\u2013water interface is overestimated by the model at very short term.

Influences of flow Reynolds number and multiparticle volumetric concentration are also considered. Simulated behavior of particles within fluid is performed utilizing resolved computational fluid dynamics with the Discrete Element Method. Behavior within rough fracture apertures is contrasted against behavior within smooth wall fractures. Findings show accentuation in particle transport rate for some rough fractures at intermediate particle diameter to mechanical aperture ratio values. Further narrowing of fracture mechanical aperture past these intermediate values leads to increased particle\u2013wall collision interactions, causing attenuation of particle transport rate and eventual particle arrest. Mechanical aperture in rough fractures where particle arrest occurs is appreciably larger than particle diameter and largely depend on surface fractal dimension and asperity height root-mean-square. Multiparticle flow and transport evaluations also reveal that increased particle interactions lead to varied hydraulic aperture values. Hydraulic aperture is found to be dependent on combined effects from injection particle volumetric concentration and surface roughness at moderate mechanical aperture, with increasing importance of surface roughness as mechanical aperture narrows. Further, it is found that particle jamming depends more on fracture geometry than injected particle volumetric concentration.

Furthermore, the study demonstrates that a reduction in dissolution rate leads to an increase in lateral stress. The microstructural analysis utilizing average particle velocity indicates that the increasing dissolution rate does not enhance particle rearrangement of the same order.

Although the copper is very stiff and resistant and will be emplaced in a clay volume, shear deformations occurring in the clay barrier may have an impact on the canister. A Mock-up test was carried out in a steel cell at a scale of about 1:10 for assessing the consequences of a shear zone for a copper rod that was surrounded by compacted bentonite as a clay barrier.

Specimens of a fine sand and a silty fine sand were prepared at degrees of saturation between 20% and 50%, before being subjected to heating from their base. Repeated scans, set up to balance image quality and scan duration, were carried out during the heating process, and Gaussian decomposition techniques were used to determine the changing soil phase proportions throughout the experiments. Based on these results and the accompanying numerical simulation of the experiments, it is shown that rapid vapour diffusion plays a more significant role than liquid flow in all cases. The rate of water content and hence degree of saturation change was more rapid in the less saturated specimens, especially for the fine sand. In practical terms, these moisture changes would result in reduction in thermal conductivity, especially in the soils of lower saturation.

Many parameters such as mud weight, well trajectory, in-situ stresses, etc., could affect the wellbore instability. Wellbore stability analysis can be implemented using an elastic or a plastic solution. This paper uses both solutions to analyze wellbore stability for a well called Well-A in an Iranian southwest oil field. First, a mechanical earth model (MEM) was established and calibrated through the required information. Afterward, regarding the linear elastic solution, four rock failure criteria, including Mohr\u2013Coulomb, Mogi\u2013Coulomb, Hoek\u2013Brown, and Modified Lade, were employed to predict the safe mud weight windows. In the section on plasticity, the stability analysis was executed analytically using an elastic\/ideally plastic model. Then the numerical solutions using a finite difference code were applied to determine the optimum mud weight and evaluate the results of analytical computations. From the obtained results, it was found that the Mogi\u2013Coulomb criterion provides the most reliable safe mud weight window for an elastic analysis. Numerical solution results sufficiently confirmed the authenticity of analytic elastic and elastic\/perfectly plastic solutions. In addition, the numerical method was capable of determining the proper optimum mud weight using Mohr\u2013Coulomb combined with plasticity. According to the depths of Well-A experiencing wellbore instabilities and associated geomechanical problems, the results of both numerical and linear elastic solutions demonstrated an advantageous agreement with the actual observations. Consequently, the study elucidates that in order to achieve superior drilling operations, the approaches used to analyze wellbore stability could be competently employed to determine the possibility of wellbore instabilities and design an appropriate mud weight concerning Well-A or subsequent similar wells located in the present oil field.\n               ","51":"\n                  Matric suction is an important parameter controlling the hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils.

The final expression is derived based upon the Young\u2013Laplace capillary principle and only needs the enthalpy of immersion at the reference temperature and as primary input parameters. Under undrained (constant water) conditions, the closed-form model incorporates the impact of temperature on matric suction by considering the temperature dependency of the liquid\u2013gas interfacial tension, the contact angle of the solid\u2013liquid\u2013gas interface, and the enthalpy of immersion. The model is validated against six sets of experimental data for clay, silt, and sand, reported in the literature. The results show a very good agreement between measured and predicted values for all soil types over a wide range of temperatures.

However, for novel piled foundations used as ground heat exchangers, there are few such analytical solutions available that are practical for routine implementation. This paper examines the use of a radial approximation to simulate the dynamic thermal behaviour of pile heat-exchangers. Originally developed for small diameter and high aspect ratio borehole heat exchangers, the approach is more challenging for piles since unsteady heat transfer within the pile material is more significant over typical timescales. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that for pile diameters between 300\u00a0mm and 1200\u00a0mm, generally the error is <1 \u00b0C with centrally placed heat transfer pipes or four or more pipes placed near the edge with circumferential spacing less than 550\u00a0mm.

These sediments are known for their exceptionally high water content, plasticity index, and porosities. The present study describes a systematic evaluation of the thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity of Texcoco clays and their inherent variability. Forty laboratory samples from eleven different locations were studied using the dual-probe heat pulse method, X-ray diffractometry, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and standard soil classification tests. The results showed that the studied samples have lower thermal conductivities and higher specific heat capacities than those previously reported for saturated clays. These differences were mainly attributed to the high porosities of the peculiar clays from the former Lake Texcoco. The thermal conductivity did not show a specific trend with depth. From statistical analyses, it was established that the shifted lognormal distribution and the normal distribution accurately describe the natural variability of the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, respectively. Finally, the efficacy of eight selected prediction models for the thermal conductivity of saturated clays was assessed. The geometric mean and the weighted series-parallel heat flow (WSP) models delivered the best fit to the experimental data.

This study investigates wellbore stability in overbalanced drilling by proposing exact solutions for multi-physics fields, taking into account the more general non-hydrostatic far-field stresses, partial multi-field coupling and the influences of hydrate dissociation, i.e., the water\/heat production\/absorption and the change in the physical properties of reservoirs due to hydrate dissociation.\n                  Wellbore drilling is simplified as a non-axisymmetric plane strain problem for the mechanical field and an axisymmetric problem for the pressure\/temperature\/salt concentration fields, in which the drilling domain includes four annular regions with different physical properties. The closed-form solutions for the temperature, pore pressure and salt concentration fields are obtained by considering the influence of water\/heat production\/absorption in the compatibility conditions of the steady-state governing equations. The solutions can explain the secondary formation of MHs around the dissociation front. The stress and drilling-induced displacement are then derived for the multi-region elastic problem subjected to non-hydrostatic far-field stresses considering seepage flow, with which the initial failure zone can be addressed by considering a failure criterion. The analytical solutions are verified by the good agreement between analytical and numerical results based on the same assumptions. Furthermore, the comparison between the analytical solutions and the results from complex numerical models suggests the applicability of the proposed solutions.

A six-arm calliper logging tool was applied to measure the wellbore data, and a cubic spline function was firstly adopted to reconstruct the wellbore. Then a 3D dynamic visualization description of the wellbore was realized based on the visualization toolkit. The results indicate that the 3D dynamic wellbore view can intuitively describe the characteristics of a high ovality and notable axial irregularity of the cross section of the wellbore drilled with BHA with an air hammer (AH-BHA), while the wellbore drilled with a pre-bent pendulum bottom hole assembly(PBP-BHA) exhibits low ovality and a smooth and regular shape along the axial direction. This can explain why it is difficult to run casing in a hole section drilled with AH-BHA. The FEM calculation example shows that the regularity of wellbore has a great influence on the bit side force. The BHA, which generates a bit side force that would reduce wellbore deviation in regular wellbore, may even produce a bit side force\u00a0that increases wellbore inclination in severely irregular wellbore, and can be used to reveal the deviation mechanism in the air\/gas drilling process.

This study presents data of 88 static tension load tests conducted on 44 small piles at 1, 2, 10, and 100 days after their installation by four different methods.

EICP is a biochemical process that produces calcium carbonate precipitation within a soil matrix to improve the geotechnical properties of the soil. Direct shear test (DST) was used to examine the shear behavior of bio-cemented beach sand after one and two cycle treatment, the results of which showed that the cohesion was increased substantially, especially after the second cycle; conversely, the friction angle was decreased.

Herein, we use hydromechanically coupled finite element models to investigate how and when a critical state of stress emerges on a fault during pore pressure decline for a setting typical for the North German Basin. Proceeding from this critical state of stress and assuming a velocity weakening friction law the dynamic rupture is modelled. Normal faulting slip is found at the depth of the reservoir nucleating near its top in the hanging wall. A vertical offset of the reservoir at the fault of half its thickness produces the largest earthquake among the cases tested between zero offset and equal to the reservoir thickness, but fault reactivation occurs first for larger offsets. Regarding the relative position of production wells to the fault simultaneous production from both compartments leads to earlier reactivation and larger earthquakes compared to if production is from only one compartment.

We show that taking into account the DZ generally leads to higher sustainable injection pressure (more than twice in compressional and about 30% in the extensional regime). Under compressional, shear failure initiates and grows from the FC\/DZ interface in HE, whereas it preferably develops in the injection zone in HO. Under extensional regime, the HE exhibits shear failure development in the DZ adjacent to the FC. Further investigations on shear failure integrating the orientations of the FC and pre-existing fractures in the DZ confirm that FC\/DZ interface is the reservoir compartment where failure first occurs when DZ with realistic hydro-poro-mechanical properties are taken into account.

One area that requires further attention is the clarification of the foundation response under seasonal cyclic thermal loading. This study systematically assesses the impact of balanced cyclic thermal loading in relation to the initial mechanical loading, for isolated floating piles and pile groups in a frictional soil medium. The pile thermal response was evaluated for differing levels of mobilisation of the shaft resistance with respect to the initial mechanical loading and for piles at varying spacing based on a unit cell approach. Isolated piles with high shaft mobilisation were found to develop significant irrecoverable settlement during thermal cycling however the maximum thermal stress was similar irrespective of the initial shaft mobilisation. These results are remarkably similar to those reported in small scale tests of TA piles in sand, confirming that the behaviour reported in these is likely to be due to the result of low shaft restraint, rather than thermally-induced loss of resistance on the pile\u2013soil interface. On the other hand, piles in close proximity were found to behave quasi thermo-elastically at the same initial mechanical load, which is attributed to an alteration in mobilised pile resistance due to pile\u2013soil\u2013pile interference under the initial mechanical loading and, to a lesser extent, thermal activation of the ground between the piles both of which reduce the relative movement between the pile and the soil.

One of these is the decision to begin flooding the mining excavations with underground water. The process of liquidation of an underground mine brings with it a number of problems and dangers related to, among others, the environment, geomechanics and surface protection.\n                  This article aims to present the possibility of forecasting deformation of the land surface as a result of the flooding of underground excavations characterised by steeply inclined seams and to indicate the dangers posed by the liquidation of underground mines to the environment and civil engineering structures.

A multistage RLT test was adopted to investigate the deformation behavior of CB and RCA over a wide range of stress levels. The stiffness of materials was evaluated in different stress combinations. A small-scale prototype pavement system with a serpentine-shaped copper pipe was placed in the C&D base layer for evaluating the potential of heat energy extraction. Comparisons were made between the performance of CB and RCA for construction of geothermal pavements. RCA was found to be considerably superior to CB in terms of strength and deformation properties. On the other hand, the geothermal pavement constructed with CB was found to have slightly more favorable thermal performance due to the higher thermal conductivity of CB compared to RCA. A numerical model was developed and validated based on the experimental results to investigate the effect of design parameters on the thermal performance of the geothermal pavements. The effect of base layer thermal conductivity, Reynolds number, solar irradiance, inlet water temperature, and pipe embedment depth, was investigated on the surface temperature reduction and heat gain of the system.

It allows to understand the prevailing in-situ stress and changes in terms of stress, deformation and rock failure that could result from planned operations. Such modeling is thus key to guide safe subsurface operations of many types and it is paramount that all available data and known complexity is captured in the highest possible resolution in these models. This results in a continuous quest for larger numerical simulations, which in turn demand software and linear solver technology to keep pace and ensure those do not become a limiting factor for computing the in-situ stress field.\n                  In this study, a FE simulator for 3D geomechanical modeling is optimized in multiple aspects to efficiently solve high resolution numerical stress simulations on large scales consisting of hundreds of millions of elements.

This study presents a temperature-dependent model for the tensile strength characteristic curve (TSCC) of unsaturated soils. The model employs the suction stress characteristic curve (SSCC) to represent the uniaxial tensile strength of unsaturated soils at different water contents and temperatures. The model incorporates the effects of temperature into adsorptive and capillary suction stress components. The temperature-dependent adsorptive suction stress is obtained by accounting for thermal induced changes in suction stress at dry state through the Hamaker constant and the density of water. The temperature-dependent form of capillary suction stress is derived by employing temperature-dependent forms of surface tension, contact angle and enthalpy of immersion. Upon comparison, results from the proposed TSCC exhibited a very good agreement against laboratory-measured tensile strength data for two clayey soils tested at different temperatures ranging from 20 to 60\u00a0\u00b0C.

The second part of the paper is dedicated to low-cycle loading. A data base with a large number of undrained cyclic triaxial tests performed on a fine sand is presented. The test conditions comprise stress or strain-controlled cycles, performed from isotropic or anisotropic initial stresses and involving different densities and amplitudes. The predictions of three sophisticated constitutive models for sand, namely hypoplasticity with intergranular strain, ISA and Sanisand, are tested against the experimental data.

In low plastic structured clays and dry compacted soils, in which an aggregate microstructure has been evidenced, the decrease in volume under mechanical compression result from the collapse of inter-aggregates pores in an ordered manner, from the larger to the smaller, with no effect on the intra-aggregate porosity. The soil skeleton can hence be modelled as an elastic fragile porous matrix, affected by the ordered collapse of its pores. Things are different in plastic soils, due to the significant reactivity of the montmorillonite minerals to changes in water content that results in significant changes of the initial porous matrix. The ordered adsorption of layers of water molecules in clay platelets with respect to the suction or stress applied, evidenced long time ago in Soil science through X-ray diffraction techniques, appear to be able to help better understanding various phenomena like the compression of plastic compressible soils and the hydration of compacted bentonites. Interestingly, it also applies to understand the effects of smectite minerals in the volume changes behaviour of the Callovo\u2013Oxfordian claystone. These two mechanisms at nano and microscopic scales hence provide a better understanding of the macroscopic volume changes of a large variety of natural and compacted clayey soils and rocks.\n               ","93":"\n                  On advanced laboratory testing of geomaterials with emphasis on unconventional types of liquefaction tests, it is attempted to report some of the past and recent challenges in developing\/improving laboratory stress\u2013strain soil testing apparatuses and relevant control\/measurement techniques. They include a) local measurements in triaxial tests on prismatic\/cylindrical specimens and torsional shear\/triaxial tests on hollow cylindrical specimens, b) non-destructive evaluation of particle crushing and inter-particle sliding based on AE measurements, c) special types of liquefaction tests using motor-driven loading devices on specimens with thin sandy layer as well as those consisting of segregated layers with direct\/indirect evaluation of local deformation, and d) other special types such as large deformation tests, tension tests and long-term tests.

Particle size analysis shows that the small grains tend to disappear due to the chemical reaction, whereas the distribution of large grains is not much affected. The dissolution process induces a decrease of the fractal number of the grain size distribution and an increase of the roughness of the particles. The study of the rate-and-state parameter of the materials, which is commonly used to characterize the ability of the fault to generate earthquakes, shows a decrease towards more negative values with dissolution for dry specimens and an increase for wet samples. Moreover, a decrease of the steady state friction coefficient is observed with dissolution for wet samples. This decrease of the friction would promote the triggering of slip along an existing fault after the injection of an acid fluid like in the cases of CO2 storage or acid gas disposal projects in a carbonate reservoir, but the increase of the rate and state parameter (a\u2013b) of saturated specimens implies that the seismogenic potential of faults could potentially be reduced.\n               ","95":"\n                  At ten percent of sedimentary rocks, limestones are common geo-energy reservoirs.

The comparison between the thermomechanical characteristics of the solid energy pile and pipe energy pile was analyzed by using the model test method. The potential effects of thermal cycles on the horizontal earth pressure and the pile resistance redistribution were analyzed and discussed. Moreover, this paper also presents a preliminary investigation on the thermally induced contraction of the surrounding sandy soil. The results showed that the repeated expansion and contraction of energy piles would induce decreases in the horizontal earth pressure and impose an increased tip resistance to balance the shaft resistance reduction during the thermal cycles. Settlement would gradually accumulate at a reducing rate for the energy piles, and the accumulation of the pile settlement could be accompanied by the thermal contraction of the sandy soil. After three thermal cycles, the solid pile accumulated a 20% greater percentage of pile settlement than the pipe pile. However, the reduction in the shaft resistance of the pipe pile was larger than that of the solid pile.

The results show that the gas\/water can significantly affect the pore pressure of the material, which can further affect the total pressure of the compacted bentonite\/sand sample. There exists a mathematical relationship between the gas pressure, total pressure, and effective swelling pressure. Furthermore, the influence of the size effect on the swelling properties and gas breakthrough properties of compacted bentonite\/sand mixture was also investigated.

Core-flooding experiments were performed under different overburden stresses and pore pressure conditions to determine the permeability of sandstone specimens to brine and CO2-enriched brine. Subsequently, variations in porosity, pore-size distribution and surface gas permeability were evaluated.

Evaluation of the permeability evolution revealed significant permeability enhancement during CO2-enriched brine injection, where the S2 specimen\u2019s permeability was increased up to 3 times and permeability of S1 increased by two orders of magnitude.

In this paper, we used case examples from the Fayetteville, Niobrara and Marcellus US shale plays to demonstrate how borehole structural geology, based on borehole-wall images alone, allows to document the geological structure in 3D (faults and natural fractures included) with high resolution, up to tens to hundreds of meters away from the well \u2014\u00a0a dimension characteristic of hydraulic fractures. We investigated on those examples whether 1D assumptions were violated. In all three cases, structural features (folding and faulting) were observed with amplitudes up to tens of meters, though below seismic resolution. Borehole-wall images further provided information on natural fracture orientation and distribution, which enabled discrete fracture network modeling. Thanks to the 3D nature of the structural model, the effects of the structure, rock mass anisotropy and heterogeneity, were better accounted for when modeling geomechanical conditions. Well log and core data were positioned more accurately with respect to the layers and lateral variability in both material properties and pressure was therefore better assessed. Moreover, faults and natural fractures were accounted for. All of these effects were observed to be significant on the stress field along layers, across fault blocks, and at discontinuities, including significant stress rotations and substantial effects in stress magnitudes. We finally show how horizontal well placement and hydraulic fracturing are sensitive to such 3D effects.

The unequal equilibrium pressure in the vertical and lateral directions was measured when the upper gap and center hole were set. The lateral pressure tended to be higher than the vertical pressure. The residual compaction pressure likely explains the higher equilibrium lateral pressure.

Under fully saturated condition, the distribution of water content throughout the specimen after self-sealing suggested that the dry density of the swollen part was lower than the initial specimen part, despite the presence of steady state pressures. It is most likely that the density distribution remained after self-sealing if external factors, including changeable boundary conditions and pore water chemistry, are not considered.

Since then, a massive research effort was dedicated to the geology of the Brazilian onshore karstified carbonate formations; however, geomechanical modeling of reservoirs with karstic cavities remains unexplored in the literature. This work analyzes the mechanical behavior of karstified carbonate reservoirs during the hydrocarbon production period. A synthetic case study based on real geologic horizons of a Brazilian basin is carried out to predict the mechanical response of the reservoir and surroundings. The presence of a preexistent cavity developing around the reservoir symmetry axis is postulated. Different scenarios of karstic geometry and filling material are considered. Results focus on reservoir compaction, surface subsidence, and stress paths in regions of interest of the reservoir, caprocks, and cavity wall. Comparative results show that the horizontal extension of the cavity and the compressibility of the filling material play an important role in reservoir integrity. The qualitative results are useful for the oil and gas industry in terms of identifying problematic regions for wells and establishing loading limits. The findings and the preliminary results of this innovative work shall guide further advanced analyses, especially in the area of dolines generation from karstic cavities.\n               ","114":"\n                  Geotechnical structures are being increasingly employed, in Europe as all around the world, to exchange heat with the ground and supply thermal energy for heating and cooling of buildings and de-icing of infrastructure. Most current practical applications are related to energy piles, but embedded retaining walls are now also being adopted. However, analysis and design methods for these new dual use foundations and ground heat exchangers are currently lacking, making it hard to provide estimates of energy availability without recourse to full numerical simulation. This paper helps to fill this gap by using coupled thermo-hydro finite element analysis to develop charts of energy capacity that could be applied at the outline design stage for energy walls. In particular, the influence of ground properties (hydraulic and thermal conductivities), and ground conditions, (groundwater temperature and flow velocity) are investigated with the results showing that the hydrogeological conditions and the temperature difference between the ground source and application temperature are especially important in determining the performance of the energy wall.\n               ","115":"\n                  In deep underground mines, a successful development plan to exploit deeper mining levels is highly dependent on adequate consideration of the magnitude and orientation of situ stress state. However, significant uncertainties are associated with the estimation of these parameters. The in-situ stress values that are used in the evaluation of the stability of underground structures in each mine strongly depends on the results of measurement of the stresses as function of the mine depth and the methodology used for the interpretation of the data as well as engineering judgment. These interpretations could produce several scenarios for estimating the stresses in a mine. Each scenario could yield different stability assessment results some of which were not normally used in the current mine stability study. Three different scenarios for estimating stress at the Niobec underground mine (Quebec, Canada) were determined based on the data available from previous stress measurement campaigns. Numerical modeling (FLAC3D) was used to evaluate the potential of brittle, tensile and compressive failure for the vertical transverse and rib pillars. The results demonstrate that in spite of the development of extensive brittle and tensile damage zones within the rock mass, no major brittle or tensile failure is expected to occur at the considered mining levels based on all three stress scenarios. Moreover, meaningful differences in the stability analysis results between the three stress scenarios highlight the importance of appropriate selection of stress estimation approaches in planning deeper mine levels.\n               ","116":"\n                  In this note we present a theoretical study on the conditions for the onset of cracks, as well as the corresponding pattern formation, in saturated viscoplastic soils under isotropic loading (extension).

By treating the saturated soil as rigid viscoplastic, we obtain a 2D extension of the Cnoidal Waves equations (Veveakis and Regenauer-Lieb, 2015). By numerically solving the corresponding boundary value problem, we retrieve conditions for the onset of cracking instability in 2D loading, and identify the characteristic spacing between cracks to be a length scale combining all the hydro-mechanical parameters of the problem. Finally, we show that in a rectangular slab of clay under isotropic extension, patterns of triangular, rectangular and hexagonal cracks can tessellate the domain, with the hexagonal pattern being the energetically favored, as it minimizes the free energy of the system.\n               ","117":"\n                  Chemical treatment is one of the popular methods dealing with geoenviromental problems related to soil, such as waste dredged materials, soil with heavy metal pollutions, among others.

It is found that the water content and pH value decreased whereas the density increased, as the phophogysum content increased. These changes were attributable to the formation of ettringite related to the chemical reaction between phosphogypsum and cementitious materials (calcium aluminate hydrates). The unconfined compression strengths of the cement stabilized soil with phosphogypsum content of 1.4% to 8.6% were approximately 1.7 to 9.4 times of those without phosphogypsum. Particularly, the earlier strength of the stabilized soil with phosphogypsum cured at 3 and 7 days increased by 1.3 and 2.1 times in comparison with those lacking phosphogypsum. The mineralogical changes revealed that when the cementation bonding was sufficiently formed at 28 days of curing, the increase in ettringite with phosphogypsum content behaved positive influence on strength development of cement stabilized soil. When cementation bonding was relatively low before 7 days of curing, adequate phosphogypsum content might produce moderate level of ettringite, tended to swell and make denser fabric, resulting in the strength increase. It should be also noted that over-dosage of phosphogypsum might cause volume increase and structure disruption, leading to the strength loss.\n               ","118":"\n                  Saline solution has considerable influence on the thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of compacted bentonite.

Such formulation results in an explicit \u201cresponse-matrix\u201d approach, where the forcing terms depend on the pore pressure variations, and the matrix coefficients account for the selected basin compressibility model. The implementation approach is quite straightforward and powerful, as it allows, for example, to easily construct a land subsidence package \u201conline\u201d over any groundwater flow model, or estimate \u201coffline\u201d the land surface displacement associated with any simulated or observed 3D pore pressure change field.

As a matter of fact, there exist several approaches to investigate the related geological, physical, chemical and biological effects and obtain an increased understanding of the relevant processes, the characteristics of the host rock and the geotechnical barrier. The common goal of all investigation concepts is a fundamental understanding of the whole system as this is of significant importance for the implementation of a secure repository for high-level radioactive waste. Typical investigation methods are geological investigations, laboratory investigations, in-situ measurements, as well as numerical modelling approaches. Many of these investigations are hosted in Underground Research Laboratories like \u00c4sp\u00f6\n1\n in Sweden, Meuse\/Haute-Marne\n2\n in France, Grimsel\n3\n and Mont Terri\n4\n in Switzerland amongst others. They are operated in close collaboration with related laboratory experiments. The development of conceptual approaches and numerical models for safety assessments associated with these geophysical investigations is carried out in the context of international projects like DECOVALEX,\n5\n FORGE,\n6\n BEACON\n7\n and implemented in codes like OpenGeoSys,\n8\n\n,\n\n9\n CodeBright,\n10\n Lagamine,\n11\n\n,\n\n12\n 3DEC\n13\n\n,\n\n14\n amongst others. Additional effort is undertaken in the area of data as well as knowledge management, visualisation techniques and recently also in fields like artificial intelligence or similar approaches. All geological and geophysical findings have to be interpreted in a combined manner to establish a groundwork for a holistic understanding of the system including information about uncertainties and possible risks. The complex information is characterised by various uncertainties and relevant boundary conditions that have to be considered for the interpretation of the results. Consequently, there exists a relevant need of knowledge management in order to find the best possible solution for the management of high-level radioactive waste. This is an important basis for a political decision which is supported by the population.\n\nThis paper focuses on the interface between geologic- geophysical investigations and numerical modelling approaches with regard to the impact of host-rock heterogeneities on the convergence behaviour around an excavation. Understanding the short- and long-term convergence behaviour of excavations is a challenging task with high relevance for the safety assessment of a potential HLW repository. The topic has also been discussed in Refs.\u00a015\u201318. In the literature, various laboratory and in-situ observations concerning the geologic and geophysical characteristics of Opalinus Clay at different scales and with different areas of interest are reported and discussed. General geologic investigations exist to characterise the Opalinus Clay like.\n4\n\n,\n\n19\u201321\n Other studies\n22\n focus on the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the excavation damaged zone and on the hydraulic\u2013mechanical effects due to excavation\n15\n\n,\n\n23\n using in-situ investigations. Furthermore, research is carried out to understand the coupled HM behaviour of fault zones.\n24\n\n,\n\n25\n Additionally, laboratory experiments are performed, interpreted and discussed in Ref.\u00a026. Nevertheless, the interpretation of the observed characteristics and the related numerical modelling approaches are part of the current research\n27\n and pose many open questions, for example the implications of fault zones for safety assessments. General statements are rarely possible and the interpretation demands interdisciplinary collaboration. The work at hand presents a combined interpretation of geologic characterisation as well as geodetic and geotechnical measurements supported by visualisation techniques. It focuses on a specific experiment carried out in the Opalinus Clay of the Mont Terri rock laboratory in Switzerland and enables an improved system understanding. The interdisciplinary approach shown here proposes a methodic approach shifting from a pure process level to a system level understanding. It provides information about the possibilities of different investigation methods and, with the help of visual methods, simplifies the interpretation of the results obtained. Finally, it aims at informing about the impact of various fault zones on the integrity and stability of potential waste repositories.\nThe Mont Terri rock laboratory accommodates various field experiments focusing on coupled thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, chemical and biological effects in Opalinus Clay as summarised in Ref.\u00a04. The coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical (HM) effects are in the focus of experiments like the Ventilation Experiment (VE),\n28\n the RA experiment (Updated review of the Rock Mechanics Properties of the Opalinus Clay of the Mont Terri URL based on Laboratory and Field Testing\n29\n) and also in the CD-A (Influence of humidity on cyclic and longterm deformations) experiment. It aims for the comprehension of these effects in claystone as they are of significant importance for the evaluation of the stability and integrity of a potential deep geological HLW repository. It is important to notice that the mentioned effects are long term effects. The expected convergence of the niches as well as possible desaturation effects take place over dozens of years whereas the investigations presented in this contribution were carried out in the first one to two years after excavation. Consequently, the presented results focus on the understanding of the system with its heterogeneities and potential areas of particular interest. The interpretation of measurements as well as the comparison of measurements and modelling results focuses on general observations concerning the system understanding and on a qualitative comparison of measurements with numerical modelling results at this stage. The planned quantitative numerical investigation of the convergence behaviour will be based on the presented findings concerning the impact of fault zones and on calibrated and further developed numerical models.\n\nThe CD-A experiment evaluates strongly coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical processes, aiming at the identification of the significant effects in the vicinity of an excavation. It is characterised by two parallel niches of 2.3m diameter and 11m length, which are both oriented perpendicular to the strike of bedding and intersect the same stratigraphical level. The CD-A experiment has been implemented in 2019 and is located in the so-called Gallery 18. Fig.\u00a01 pictures the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory in combination with the finite element mesh for the numerical CD-A model. The rock near Gallery 18 is characterised by the sandy facies of the Opalinus Clay. In the remainder of this paper, the colour code generally used in the context of the CD-A experiment is used, i.e.\u00a0results of the open twin are plotted in blue, while results of the closed twin are plotted in red, indicated by the red door sealing the closed niche (presented in Fig.\u00a02). The position along the niche axes is given below in niche meters (NM), with niche meter zero at the niche entrance of each niche. The host rock is characterised by different zones of fractured rock. The excavation and the climatic conditions in the niches lead to a desaturation of the surrounding Opalinus Clay and convergence of the niches. The surface of the claystone in the niches is not covered by any kind of stabilising support as it can be seen in Fig.\u00a02, which provides a view of both niches. Consequently, a direct exchange of the humidity and temperature in the niches and the claystone is possible, which includes desiccation effects leading to shrinkage and possible fracturing. While the closed niche features an air lock at the entrance to ensure that the relative air humidity remains as high as possible to avoid desaturation effects, the climatic conditions in the open niche vary due to seasonal effects as in the rest of the Mont Terri rock laboratory Fig.\u00a03. With that, the CD-A experiment focuses on a comparison of the processes of the two parallel niches: the open niche is characterised by effects due to seasonal desaturation, whereas desaturation effects are minimised in the closed niche by maintaining a constant high humidity.\n\nAfter the excavation of the niches, laser scans of both niches have been carried out and give precise information about the convergence behaviour. Furthermore, various measurements focusing on the deformation behaviour as well as hydraulic aspects are carried out and introduced in Ref.\u00a030. Fig.\u00a04 provides an overview of boreholes around the twin niches, hosting various devices monitoring the temperature, the water content (Taupe\/TDR measurements), the permeability (Evapometer measurements), the pore pressure (Minipiezometer measurements) and the temperature and strains (Extensometer measurements). Additional measurements focusing on the climatic conditions, the evolution of the water content, the electric resistivity and the evolution of microcracks are carried out within the niches. This paper concentrates on the deformation measurements within and around the niches, while the results of related measurements are discussed in Refs.\u00a031, 32. Further publications concerning these topics are in preparation.\nBesides the measurements, the current study focuses on the visualisation and interpretation of the measured convergence during the first years after excavation. Potential impacts of the heterogeneities characterising the claystone as well as preexisting fractured areas and climatic conditions within the niches are taken into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nMethods of investigation\nThe combination of different investigation methods is a promising procedure for an increased understanding of the complex coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical effects in the heterogeneous claystone. The investigation program comprises the geologic characterisation, geophysical measurements, numerical modelling and visualisation techniques and a combined interpretation of the results is presented in the following Section\u00a03.\n\n2.1\nGeology of the open and closed twin niches\nThis section provides information about the geology of the niches as it is presented in Ref.\u00a033 in detail. More information about the lithography of the Opalinus Clay in the area of the Mont Terri rock laboratory can be found in Refs.\u00a04, 20, 21. The tectonic structure of the main fault is discussed in Ref.\u00a034 and the geomechanical behaviour across multiple scales is summarised in Ref.\u00a017.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1\nMethodology\nThe geological mapping of the open and closed twin niches was performed in September 2019. The two 11m long niches with 2.3m circular shape were excavated with daily progress ranging between 1 and 2m with a pneumatic hammer. The photogrammetric system ShapeMetrix3D\u2122 was applied in order to document the geological structures on a fully digital basis. At the outcrop, a digital mapping on a tablet computer was combined with the photogrammetric acquisition. Once the 3D model of the daily advance was created in the office, the geological model could be refined and imported into the geo-modelling tool move\u2122 for further geometric analysis and the creation of the geological map view.\n\n\n2.1.2\nResults regarding lithology\nThe two niches are located in the upper sandy facies entirely. Bedding here is dipping \n\n55\n\u2013\n60\n\u00b0\n\n towards 145\u00b0. The axis of the two niches is oriented perpendicular to strike of bedding. The upper sandy facies is characterised by silty clay with abundant thin elongated sand lenses, mm-thick sand layers, calcareous micritic, bioturbated and sideritic nodules and biodetritic layers (Fig.\u00a05). Up to several tens of cm long calcareous micritic concretions with typical inherent calcite veins and cm-long pyrite nodules are common. The abrupt changes of rather soft laminated clay to well cemented and extremely hard micritic concretions lead to high sedimentary heterogeneity and changing rock stiffness. For both niches, especially in the first 3m, micritic layers of up to 30\u00a0cm thickness and large concretions are abundant. Sideritic lenses and pyrite nodules occur all over the place. A significant pyrite horizon composed of discontinuous individual nodules of 1\u20133\u00a0cm thickness is present in both niches at niche meter 3.0m.\n\n\n2.1.3\nResults on tectonic structure\nThe faults in the closed twin niche form 3 clusters. Bedding parallel faults (144\/57), flatly SW-dipping faults (195\/30) and N-S-striking faults. At niche meter (NM) 2.0, a flat SW-dipping fault displacing a biomicritic carbonate bed by about 20\u00a0cm is present (Fig.\u00a06 top). The fault cuts the same bed on the left tunnel wall displacing the bed of about 15\u00a0cm. At this location, the fault splits into two branches (Fig.\u00a06 bottom). Another conspicuous fault is a vertical N-S striking fault (097\/85) with thin calcite crystallisation. The fault crosscuts the niche obliquely from NM6 to NM8.7. The N-S striking fault was formed relatively early in the tectonic history as it was displaced by bedding parallel fault planes at several locations with displacements ranging between 5 to 15\u00a0cm (Fig.\u00a07).\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the two twin niches are parallel and only 10m apart, the observed characteristics of the faults in this region strongly differ as shown in Fig.\u00a010. In the open twin, mainly flat to very flat faults dipping SW and NW are observed. Scaly clay occurred at a flat NW-dipping fault (296\/25) intersected by the SW-dipping one at NM5.5. One major bedding parallel structure is observed. It is a 5 to 15\u00a0cm-thick fault zone (145\/59) with scaly clay and well visible shear bands at NM4.5. This bedding parallel fault zone is cutting a flat SW-dipping fault (222\/07). On the other side of the fault zone, the flat SW-dipping fault is not visible anymore (Fig.\u00a08), pointing to an enhanced displacement. This fault is part of series of calcite-filled faults occurring from NM5.5 until NM11. They are organised in a system with several levels of flat SW-NW-dipping (\n\n10\n\u2013\n25\n\u00b0\n\n) faults. All these veins are being displaced or stopping at the bedding parallel fault zone. As part of the faults, these veins are featuring a varying thickness across short distances and often split into several branches. Calcite veins can be traced over several metres and some of them show well developed drag folds indicating a dextral shear direction (Fig.\u00a09).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nGeodetic and geotechnical measurements\nIn the context of the CD-A experiment, different kinds of geodetic and geotechnical measurements are used. While this paper focuses on the deformation measurements, the investigations concerning the water content and the pore pressures will be discussed in accompanying publications (in preparation). Further information concerning the installation and the set-up of the measuring program can also be found in Refs.\u00a030, 35. Concerning the convergence of the niches, the laser scans provide detailed information at each point of the surface of the niches, while the extensometers measure deformations within the host rock and the 3D-convergence measurements provide precise information of the convergence of the niches with regard to defined anchor points and dates. The different kinds of measurements are summarised in Table\u00a01 and introduced in this section while a discussion of the results can be found in Section\u00a03.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1\nLaser scans\nWithin the first year after the excavation of the niches, laser scans with a resolution of 1\u00a0mm and an accuracy in the order of 2 to 3\u00a0mm have been carried out at seven different days during the whole year and introduced in Ref.\u00a036. The measurements are related to fixed points in Gallery 18, known to be stationary and located in the niche area. Within and in front of each niche, various targets have been positioned for the calibration of the point clouds. About 6 scans per niche were performed for pre-calibration on site to obtain the highest accuracy for the measurements on the rock. The distance of the targets, the resolution and the angle of impact of the laser on the measured element were taken into account to guarantee the quality of the measurements. First results indicate that both niches are very stable with small deformations in a range of millimetres. Fig.\u00a011 (top) presents the results of the laser scans for the initial measurements, carried out on September 13, 2019. Within the context of the CD-A experiment, the temporal evolution of the deformations at different locations is of particular interest. The results indicate areas where the surface of the host rock moves towards the central axis (convergence) of the niche or in the opposite direction (divergence) as it is presented in Fig.\u00a011 (bottom). A cylindrical coordinate system has been used for calculation and evaluation of the changes.\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a012 shows the deformation of the closed and open niches at different dates after postprocessing. The visualised measurements have been carried out in winter 2019 and summer 2020 during the first year after excavation and are evaluated with regard to the initial measurement in September 2019. Both niches are very stable but are also characterised by an ongoing convergence process with deformations in the range of tenth of millimetres as indicated by the yellow areas. These measurements indicate a convergence of the niches in the vertical direction, while the horizontal deformations show no clear trend for this short time period since excavation. In the open niche (blue frame), the pictured deformations depend significantly on the distance to the Gallery 18. A possible reason might be the geological characteristic of the host rock in this area. Judging the influence of seasonal changes of the climatic conditions is currently not possible. This is due to the fact that the available measurements correspond to a single year after excavation. Further observation of these effects within the next years will provide important information to answer some of these questions and will be part of the long-term investigation program within the CD-A experiment.\n\n\n2.2.2\n3D-convergence measurements\n\nConvergence measurements are carried out within both niches and are described in detail in Ref.\u00a030. The prisms for the convergence measurements are located at three different profiles within each niche. They are fixed in a depth of 5\u00a0cm at niche meter 5.5m and at a depth of 20\u00a0cm at 5.0m and 6.0m, respectively. This kind of measurements focuses on the long term evolution of the niches and provides periodic information regarding the displacement of the prisms. Measurements during the first months after excavation are depicted in Fig.\u00a013 for the vertical direction and in Fig.\u00a014 for the translatoric direction. The results for the positions in the upper part of the niches are presented at the top, the lower positions at the bottom. The vertical displacements indicate an uplift of the ground and a subsidence of the roof which is consistent with the expected convergence of the niches. This trend can be seen at all measured positions of the closed twin. Differing results are measured only for upper region of the SW-oriented (\u201cleft\u201d) part of the open twin which exhibits different results compared to the NE-oriented part of this niche.\n\n\nFig.\u00a014 shows the translatoric displacements within the niches. While all positions indicate displacements up to a maximum of 2.5\u00a0mm, there is one outlier in position 60. This point shows higher values up to 3.0\u00a0mm. Nevertheless, all measurements indicate a trend of the displacements towards the NE-direction. Furthermore, the measurements in the open twin indicate a slight influence of the seasonal variations of the climatic conditions of the niches. This is a preliminary assumption based on very few measurements carried out until now.\nAs expected, the measurements indicate a convergence of the niches. This trend is even clearer for the vertical direction than for the horizontal direction, which can also be seen in Fig.\u00a015. Here, the displacements measured in February 2021 are visualised with regard to the initial state measured by the laser scan. While the colour code represents the amplitude of the displacement, the radius of the coloured dots provides information about the depth of the anchor (big sphere: anchor depth of 5\u00a0cm and small sphere: anchor depth of 20\u00a0cm). Outliers are located in the NE-part of the open twin and the SW-part of the closed twin, which could be caused by the geologic heterogeneities in these zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3\nExtensometer measurements\nExtensometer measurements are used to get information about the deformation behaviour around the niches. The extensometer measurements are located in boreholes around the niches as depicted in Fig.\u00a04 and as it is carried out similarly in Ref.\u00a015. Each niche accommodates a vertical and a horizontal borehole with a length of 4m each. Two additional boreholes have been drilled from the gallery and end up at about 1m below the niches respectively. They have a length of approximately 12.5m each. Within the boreholes, chain extensometers have been installed. They consist of anchor-elements connected to each other by glass fibre rods and measure the unidirectional displacements of the anchor points relative to each other. The measuring range of the displacement sensors is 100\u00a0mm and provides an accuracy of 0.0015% of full scale (FS). The sensor is also equipped with a temperature measurement device and provides information about the length of each segment continuously. Further information is summarised in Ref.\u00a037.\n\nAs the chain extensometers provide measurements of the change of the length of a segment between two anchor points, there is no fixed point which could be used as a static reference. Consequently, the evaluation of the displacements contains uncertainties as every point might be subjected to possible movements. As a consequence, the interpretation of the measured values in the following section is carried out with two different approaches, namely the segmental interpretation and the fixpoint interpretation. The segmental interpretation gives information about the strains of each single segment and indicates directly the segments which are characterised by compression or extension. In contrast to that, the fixpoint interpretation of the measurements is characterised by the assumption that the point with the largest distance to the niche is fixed. This gives the opportunity to indicate the displacements of each anchor point relative to the fixpoint. One has to keep in mind that especially for the boreholes, which are drilled from the gallery, this approach neglects displacements near the gallery.\nThe temporal evolution of the segmental strains is presented in Fig.\u00a016 (top) for both niches while\u00a0Fig.\u00a016 (bottom) shows the situation for the last measuring date in a 3-dimensional view. Here, the colour code of the segments represents the strains of each segment. The fixpoint interpretation is pictured in Fig.\u00a017. The colour code of the measuring points indicates displacements with regard to the fixpoint. Positive values suggest an increase of the distance to the fixpoint while negative values indicate a movement of this point towards the fixpoint. Generally, the order of magnitude of the measured deformations is in the range of tenths of a millimetre. This order of magnitude of deformations seems to be in line with other tests, such as mine-by tests in different kinds of shales,\n15\n\n,\n\n23\n which yield deformations in the range of a few millimetres up to some centimetres. The measurements in the vertical boreholes indicate an uplift of the ground in both niches as expected, but the deformations around the open niche are generally larger. Finally, the interpretation of the measurements yields the following assumptions:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nMovements around the open niche (BCD-A2 and BCD-A6) are significantly higher than at comparable locations at the closed niche. This can be seen clearly in both interpretations (Figs.\u00a016 and 17). The measurements along the borehole BCD-A2 are characterised by heterogeneities which lead to differing results for the different measuring points and segments. This effect might be due to heterogeneities and fractures in this area.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe vertical deformations are characterised by positive strains (extension)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0they indicate an uplift of the ground of the niches. Remarkable in this context are the results of the segments near the twins (darkest lines). As expected, these points show the highest values. Furthermore, they show significantly different behaviour, which might be due to the different climatic conditions within the niches and will be part of further investigations.\n\n\n\u2022\nHorizontal displacements are significantly smaller than vertical displacements.\n\n\n\u2022\nWhile the deformation around the open niche tends to continue, the measurements in the closed niche seem to be characterised by reduced deformation after the first years. This might be a result of the climatic conditions within the closed niche and should be part of further long-term investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\nNumerical modelling\nAt this early state of the CD-A experiment, the model set-up aims for a basic understanding of the prevailing processes. Heterogeneities as they are discussed in this paper as well as more complex constitutive relationships like plastic or viscous behaviour, saturation dependent parameters, and swelling\/shrinkage of the host rock are not captured in the model so far. To reproduce the cyclic deformation related to the coupled process induced by seasonal humidity changes, a three-dimensional model of the Opalinus Clay with the Gallery 18 and both twin niches has been set up using the Finite Element software OpenGeoSys (OGS).\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n This modelling software is open-source, which is of great advantage in the research of numerical methods. In the geoscientific community, OGS is used to simulate thermal\u2013hydraulic\u2013mechanical and chemical processes in porous media. In this work, a macroscopic hydro-mechanical model consisting of the momentum balance equation of the solid and the mass balance equation of the pore fluid\n18\n\n,\n\n39\n\n,\n\n40\n is used. The coupling between the hydraulic and mechanical processes is realised by the Biot\u2019s effective stress law and a linear Bishop\u2019s approximation.\n40\u201342\n The main variables of the model are the solid displacement vector (deformation) and the liquid pore pressure. The hydro-mechanical coupled model takes into account variable saturation according to the Richards assumption\n43\n: The air pressure is considered constant and the liquid pore pressure drives the development of capillary pressure. The balance equations are complemented with constitutive laws such as the van\u00a0Genuchten curve\n44\n to compute variable saturation. The gas entry pressure, shape parameter and residual saturation for fitting the van\u00a0Genuchten curve are displayed in Table\u00a02. Fig.\u00a018 shows different views of the modelled domain, which has dimensions of approximately 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0m\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n and which is discretised by approximately 180 thousand tetrahedral elements for the computation with the Finite Element Method. Note that the air lock between the gallery and the closed niche are explicitly modelled, whereas the excavation damage zones are not. The material properties utilised in the simulation correspond to the sandy facies of the Opalinus Clay with anisotropic hydraulic and mechanical behaviours described in the literature.\n4\n The material properties are summarised in Table\u00a02. An anisotropy ratio of 2.5 is chosen to compute intrinsic permeability.\n45\n\n\n\n\nInitially, an in-situ stress\n18\n\n,\n\n46\n is assigned to the mesh and the liquid pore pressure is set to \n\n0\n\nMPa\n\n on the entire domain. The measurements of in-situ stress and in-situ pore pressure are challenging and change due to activities such as excavation and open conditions.\n46\n\n,\n\n47\n Note that the in-situ pore pressure is smaller than the measured pore pressure in Mont Terri\n48\n to avoid numerical instabilities due to the boundaries (size) of the modelled domain. Since the focus of the current paper is a qualitative comparison between the model behaviour and measurements, the effect of initial conditions, excavation and selected heterogeneities will be considered in further investigations. Furthermore, the mechanical boundary conditions are assigned to avoid rigid body motion normal to the outer boundaries and the liquid pore pressure around the outer boundaries of the domain corresponds to the initial condition. In the experimental setup, the relative air humidity is monitored in the niches as depicted in Fig.\u00a03. To reproduce the experiment and obtain input data for the numerical simulation, we calculate the pore pressure using the relative air humidity via the Kelvin equation. To reproduce the seasonal changes of relative humidity, a seasonal, sine shaped, time-dependent pore pressure is applied in the open niche and gallery walls (blue segments in Fig.\u00a018). A constant pressure based on the average of the largest monitored air humidity values is applied in the closed niche (light red segments in Fig.\u00a018).\nThe model is able to reproduce the expected coupled hydro-mechanical behaviour qualitatively, where changes in saturation lead to deformation (displacements). Desaturated zones are identified in the simulation after a few winter-summer cycles as shown in Fig.\u00a019. These results are in agreement with the observations, since desaturation is recorded during winter, while a re-saturation is observed in the near field during the summer period.\n18\n The low permeability of the rock does not allow for rapid changes in saturation and the material remains wetter, the further away it is from the open niche\/gallery. To avoid repetitions, the results concerning the mechanical behaviour are discussed and compared with the experiments in Section\u00a03. Further aspects regarding the modelled domain, influence of excavation and extension of constitutive laws to allow the modelling of shrinkage-induced cracking\n32\n\n,\n\n49\n will be considered in future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\nVisualisation\n\nTo facilitate an improved understanding of the complex processes taking place inside the layer of Opalinus Clay surrounding Gallery 18 and the twin niches, a 3D scene has been set up using the OpenGeoSys Data Explorer.\n50\n and ParaView\n51\n Both programmes employ the VTK programming library\n52\n for creating, modifying, and representing 3D objects and datasets. Structures such as the tunnel system, geological layers and faults are represented via triangulated surfaces of varying resolution, depending on the level of detail needed to adequately represent the data. Boreholes shown in Fig.\u00a04 are represented via tubes with a diameter scaling corresponding to the size of the diameter of the drill bit used, with locations of sensor positions (e.g.\u00a0extensometers) being enlarged for emphasis. The numerical model detailed in Section\u00a02.3 consists of over 180.000 tetrahedra, including more than a dozen parameters assigned to either nodes or cells, including material parameters required for the simulation as well as values calculated during the process simulation. Colour look-up tables and parameters such as transparency, scaling, or lighting can be adjusted for each dataset individually, based on the requirements of the research. In addition, datasets can be post-processed by applying algorithms either modifying the geometrical structure of the data (e.g.\u00a0clipping planes) or calculating representations on the node- or cell-based parameters (e.g.\u00a0contour surfaces based on simulated saturation, as shown in Fig.\u00a019). CAD-data, measurements, and simulation results are integrated within the same frame of reference, allowing for an interactive exploration of the setup of the experiment (Fig.\u00a04). With the scene being fully interactive and the user being able to navigate freely and to adjust parameters as needed, it also becomes possible to thoroughly explore and assess the complex transient hydro-mechanical simulation results calculated via OpenGeoSys and compare them to observation data collected via sensors. In addition, the 3D scene gives a structural perspective of discontinuities within the domain of the experiment and where the experiment is located, both within the Mont Terri tunnel system (Fig.\u00a01) and within the sandy facies of the Opalinus Clay layer as part of the complex stratigraphy of the Jurassic Mountains (Fig.\u00a020).\n\n\n\n3\nHolistic interpretation and discussion of the results\nThe aim of the presented investigations is an increased process understanding of the hydraulic-mechanically driven effects around the niches and the understanding of the geological system. The derived information of geological investigations has to be interpreted regarding the impact of different heterogeneities in order to decide whether the detected fault zones have to be considered in the numerical modelling approach. The introduced approaches give complementary information on various scales of time and space. The expected coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical processes are characterised by the excavation effects as well as the initial desaturation of the claystone around the niches and the gallery. The host rock is characterised by heterogeneous claystone and a complex non-linear material behaviour. The coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical effects are influenced and controlled on the one hand by the heterogeneous material composition, mineralogical composition and geologic characteristics and on the other hand by the boundary conditions like the stress field, the water content, the temperature and the technical construction of the excavated areas. The presented methods of investigation give insights in the complex situation. Main outcomes are discussed in this section.\n\nThe convergence of the niches in the vertical direction can be clearly seen in the extensometer measurements and the laser scan data at the bottom of the niches. Furthermore, the laser scans and the convergence measurements confirm this trend at the top of the niches. In the horizontal direction, such a trend is not clear yet, which is consistent with results presented in Ref.\u00a023 but might also be a matter of the short time period since the excavation of the niches. According to the laser scans, the trend of convergence is stronger in the closed niche than in the open twin. The overall trend of convergence in the measurements is also reflected by the numerical modelling results, where contraction and extension is calculated in the expected areas. The vertical strains are larger (absolute value) than the horizontal ones. Furthermore, the influence of the seasonal boundary condition is observed at the entrance of the closed niche and along the open niche. Fig.\u00a021 provides a comprehensive overview of the deformation behaviour in the measured and simulated data.\n\nThe scale of the measured deformations is in a similar range for all types of measurements and also for the numerical results. In the latter, pre-calculations to evaluate the model parameters and its sensitivity were performed. As expected, the calculated deformations near the gallery are larger than in the surrounding area. The measured range of deformations lies in the order of tenth of millimetres near the niches. Nevertheless, it is important to notice that all types of measurements indicate outliers or irregular results which may result from different uncertainty sources. The treatment of these measured values has to be discussed on the basis of the individual case. A summary of these cases is presented in Table\u00a03 and indicates that most of the deviating results are measured in the area near the open twin. This might be due to the geologic situation especially on the SW-side (\u201cleft side\u201d) of the open twin as it is presented in Fig.\u00a022. Here, an impression of the geologic situation around the niches in combination with a visualisation of the measuring positions is given (top) and fault zones of specific interest are highlighted (bottom). Another reason for irregular measurements at the open twin, especially in the near-field of the niche, might be the climatic situation of the open twin which is characterised by seasonal influences.\n\nThe interpretation of the laser scan data has to be carried out carefully as the measurements are restricted to the first year after excavation. Within this time period, the niches are very stable and the observed deformations are in a very small range, which is close to the accuracy of the measurement method. Nevertheless, the provided results are physically comprehensible as presented in Section\u00a02.2.1. The comparison of scanned data of both twins indicates different behaviour along the niche axes. While the measured trend of convergence is nearly constant along the niche axis for the closed twin, the behaviour in the open twin varies significantly along the niche as shown in Fig.\u00a012. The impact of the climatic conditions at this initial state seems to be low as the measured relative humidities show only minor variations along the niche axes. Nevertheless, the laser scan data will be in the focus of further interpretation and statistical evaluation aiming to better understand the impact of the climatic conditions.\nIn summary, the presented investigations of various kinds of measurements, geologic investigation and numerical modelling are demanding and difficult to communicate to non-experts. Each one has its particular advantages and disadvantages, and their accuracy and error-proneness have to be included in the interpretation of the results.\nThe measured values have to be checked for their physical plausibility. Do the different methods show different phenomena? Do they picture the same trend? And the same scale? Do they contain anomalies? Do the anomalies appear in more than one method? What are possible reasons? It has to be kept in mind that uncertainties due to the measuring method or inhomogeneities of the material may appear. A critical discussion of the measuring method and a suitable interpretation of the data is essential in this context.\nFor the interpretation of the numerical modelling results it has to be kept in mind that the claystone is characterised by a complex coupled thermal\u2013hydraulic\u2013mechanical\u2013chemical\u2013biological material behaviour as well as by geological heterogeneities and discontinuities on different length scales. Not all of these aspects have been taken into account in the current numerical model, since the latter is homogeneous. The consideration of the entire complexity\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including all known fault zones\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in the numerical model is not necessarily reasonable but potential impacts of some single fault zones have to be determined. The constitutive approach and the chosen material parameters have to be analysed in detail and possible sources of errors have to be taken into account by the interpretation of the results. Moreover, an extension of the modelling approach is required to account for more complex material behaviour, e.g.\u00a0plasticity, cracking. The visualisation of the dominant fault zones in the near field of the niches is a valuable tool to increase the system understanding and investigate irregularities and outliers.\nHowever, the usage of different methods and their combination in a comprehensive approach reduce the susceptibility to errors and increase the process understanding. Furthermore, it strengthens the interaction between different scientific disciplines and is an important basis for decision making and knowledge management.\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nThe use of different types of investigation methods has significant advantages such as the increase of the process and system understanding. Sophisticated visualisation techniques give valuable support to interpret the results in a consolidating manner. The combined interpretation of the results with consideration of specific uncertainties and statements regarding the relevance of different physical effects is a challenging task, but also an important basis for the enhancement of numerical modelling approaches, which are used for the safety assessment of a potential repository.\nThe investigations carried out in the context of the CD-A experiment in the Mont Terri rock laboratory indicate the expected convergence of the niches: all measurement strategies and numerical model show this trend in a similar and a comprehensive scale. Geological investigations as well as measurements underline the heterogeneity which characterises the Opalinus Clay. Seasonal effects are of lesser importance for the deformation behaviour within this first period of investigation. Nevertheless, all types of measurements show outliers which might be a result of heterogeneities, the technical boundary conditions or due to uncertainties within the measuring methods. Also, the numerical modelling approach is characterised by uncertainties due to various required input parameters, simplifying assumptions within the model setup and the mathematical formulation itself, which will never cover the reality completely. The different CD-A experiment measurements produce outliers mostly in the same niche regions. We therefore assume that a common reason for these irregular results might be inhomogeneities in the host rock originating from faults or lithological variances. Visualisation techniques are used, which help us to combine the outcome of different kinds of investigation like geologic investigations, measurements and numerical modelling.\nIn principle, the investigations in the context of the CD-A experiment focus on long-term effects such as deformations driven by the very slow desaturation of the low permeable Opalinus Clay. The investigations presented in this article focus on the initial two years of the experiment and give some insights into the geologic situation as well as the impact of the excavation and the climatic conditions on the deformations around the niches during this phase. The detected and visualised fault zones advise on the geologic situation around the twin niches. The interpretation of these heterogeneities with regard to their relevance for coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical effects is a challenging task. Ongoing investigations aim to identify zones with stronger or weaker coupled HM effects.\nFuture work will also focus on the excavation induced and seasonal effects within the niches and their impact on the coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical processes. In this context, further hydraulic-mechanically coupled effects such as swelling and shrinkage, the evolution of desiccation cracks and their handling in a constitutive modelling approach are of specific interest. Furthermore, the continued detailed interpretation of the ongoing measurements and the reinforced use of visualisation techniques are foreseen. The well established multidisciplinary evaluation presented in this article will be continued.\nThe interpretation of the first data sets of the CD-A experiment in a holistic manner provides a diverse and detailed insight into the coupled hydraulic\u2013mechanical effects around the twin niches in the Mont Terri rock laboratory. In summary, the presented research has shown that the multidisciplinary approach combining geological mapping, geophysical measurements, numerical modelling and visualisation techniques is a promising way to better understand complex mechanisms and the process behind them. Thus, it can be a valuable component for the safe construction and operation of a repository and for the long term safety assessment.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nG.

They are usually associated with complex internal structures involving fault core(s) and damage zones, rendering a hierarchically organised system of heterogeneous geological composites.\n1\u20133\n The fault core accommodates most of the historical shear displacement and may consist of slip surfaces, unconsolidated gouges, cohesive cataclasites and\/or breccia materials.\n4\n\n,\n\n5\n Damage zones that bound the fault core are characterised by networks of off-fault secondary structures like fractures and veins.\n6\n\n,\n\n7\n Extensive investigations have been done in the past to characterise the geological, mechanical, and hydrological properties of crustal fault zones,\n8\u201312\n which reveal that their behaviour is highly controlled by their architectural features.\nThe understanding and prediction of fault zone behaviour is critically important for many geoscience and geoengineering problems, especially for those fluid injection-related applications,\n13\u201316\n such as enhanced geothermal systems, unconventional oil\/gas reservoirs, waste water disposal, and carbon sequestration. The injection of a large volume of fluids into subsurface geological formations at great depths may activate\/reactivate some of the seismogenic faults through various mechanisms such as pore pressure diffusion,\n17\n poroelastic stress transfer,\n18\n and aseismic slip.\n19\n The faulting process may produce large magnitude man-made earthquakes that can be felt by the public on the ground surface and provoke significant societal concerns.\n13\n One typical example is the 2017 \n\n\nM\n\n\nw\n\n\n 5.5 Pohang earthquake in South Korea, which occurred about two months after massive water injection into an enhanced geothermal system nearby. Whether this earthquake was induced by fluid injection or not has been hotly debated \n20\n\n,\n\n21\n, and finally a detailed investigation by an international research advisory committee has led to a conclusion that it was triggered by fluid injection into a previously unmapped fault zone.\n22\n Hence, it is essential to develop an improved understanding and predictability of injection-induced fault responses.\nOver the past decade, a large body of academic research has been conducted to model fault behaviour in response to underground fluid injection. For example, Cappa and Rutqvist\n23\n proposed a hydro-mechanical modelling approach for simulating injection-induced fault deformation and permeability evolution with the fault represented as either a zero-thickness interface or a finite-thickness layer. Rutqvist et\u00a0al. \n24\n\n,\n\n25\n further used the finite-thickness layer model to perform two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) simulations of fault slip during hydraulic fracturing in shale formations and estimated the moment magnitude of potential induced earthquakes. Figueiredo et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n26\n combined this approach with a damage mechanics model to investigate the interaction between a hydraulic fracture and a nearby pre-existing fault. Zeng et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n27\n recently conducted numerical simulations based on the zero-thickness interface model and analysed the effect of reservoir permeability heterogeneity on the fault slip during fluid injection at different distances with respect to the fault. In addition, some efforts have also been devoted to study the role of fault architecture in injection-induced fault responses. Rinaldi et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n28\n analysed the influence of hydro-mechanical heterogeneities of a fault zone on the pressure diffusion and frictional slip along the fault subject to fluid injection, and reported that heterogeneities tend to inhibit upward fluid leakage and suppress seismic rupture. Yehya et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n29\n modelled the porosity\/permeability evolution and poroelastic response of a fault zone consisting of a low-permeability fault core and a damage zone represented by an anisotropic high-permeability continuum, and observed a strong control by the fault architecture on the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the fault.\nIn these previous studies, the fault zone is modelled either as a single plane (conditioned with certain constitutive relationships) or a multilayer composite (with the fault core and damage zone represented as a sequence of continua). However, such treatments do not allow a full capture of the detailed processes operating inside the fault damage zone, which is usually characterised by a dense network of fractures. Some recent field experiments conducted at the Grimsel and Bedretto Underground Research Laboratories have revealed that mesoscale fracture systems in fault zones accommodates very rich and complex seismo-hydro-mechanical phenomena during hydraulic stimulation.\n30\u201332\n In this paper, we present a modelling attempt to unravel this complexity based on a fully-coupled hydro-mechanical model\n33\n that we have recently developed to simulate fluid injection-induced damage growth, fracture slip, poroelastic response, and seismicity occurrence in fractured rocks. We apply this model to analyse the seismo-hydro-mechanical processes in the fracture network of a fault zone. Section\u00a02 presents the governing equations of our numerical model; Section\u00a03 describes the model setup including the geometrical configurations, boundary conditions, and material properties; Section\u00a04 shows the simulation results and detailed analysis, followed by a brief discussion in Section\u00a05 and some conclusions in Section\u00a06.\n\n\n2\nA fully-coupled hydro-mechanical model\nThe mechanical equilibrium of a fractured rock is governed by: \n\n(1)\n\n\n\u2207\n\u22c5\n\u03c3\n+\nf\n=\n0\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\u03c3\n is the stress and f is the body force.

The local seismic activities are grouped into clusters according to their spatio-temporal correlations,\n44\n such that spatially adjacent and temporally connected damages are considered as a single seismic event with the seismic moment calculated as: \n\n(12)\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n\ni\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nn\n\n\nd\n\n\n is the number of damages belonging to the same seismic event.

Here, we will apply this model to simulate fluid injection into the fractured rock of a fault zone.\n\n\n3\nModel setup\nWe conduct a generic study of a fractured rock within a mature strike-slip fault zone consisting of a low-permeability fault core and a high-permeability damage zone at a depth of 3600 m in granitic rock. We consider a 2D rectangular-shaped study area of 200 m by 100 m (Fig.\u00a01) and assume an out-of-plane thickness of 10 m. We define a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the centre of the domain, and \nx\n-axis and \ny\n-axis being perpendicular and parallel to the fault plane, respectively. The fault core with a thickness of 10\u00a0cm is located at the middle of the domain, while the damage zone with a width of 200 m (including both lateral sides) is characterised by a network of 5 m-long fractures (representing the so-called mesoscopic damage zone structures\n47\n\n,\n\n48\n). Here, the fault core thickness and damage zone width are defined to be representative of many crustal fault zones .\n5\n. Two fracture sets are assumed with their mean orientations as 45\u00b0and 135\u00b0with respect to the \nx\n-axis and a directional dispersion of \n\u00b1\n15\u00b0relative to the mean. Such a fracture orientation setting somewhat reflects the field observation that many of the subsidiary fractures in damage zones are oblique to the main fault plane.\n48\n The fracture intensity \n\u03b3\n decays with the distance away from the fault core, following an exponential function \n11\n\n,\n\n49\n\n,\n\n50\n as: \n\n(15)\n\n\n\u03b3\n=\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\nr\n\n\n+\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\nexp\n\n(\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\n|\nx\n|\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n0\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\nr\n\n\n are the fracture intensities at the boundary of the fault core and in the host rock outside the fault zone, respectively, \n\u03bb\n is a constant defining the decay rate, and x is the distance away from the fault core. We assume \n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n5\n\n m\u22121, \n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\nr\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n02\n\n m\u22121, and \n\n\u03bb\n=\n0\n.\n05\n\n m\u22121, such that \n\u03b3\n decays to \n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\nr\n\n\n at x\n\n=\n\n\n\u00b1\n100 m (i.e.\u00a0the width of the entire damage zone is 200 m). We classify the fault damage zone into three subdomains (Fig.\u00a01) based on the degree of fracturing: high-density fracture zone (with \n\n\u03b3\n\u2265\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\/2), medium-density fracture zone (with \n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\/\n5\n\u2264\n\u03b3\n<\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\/\n2\n\n), and low-density fracture zone (with \n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\nr\n\n\n\u2264\n\u03b3\n<\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\/\n5\n\n). The boundary between the high and medium-density fracture zones is at about x\n\n=\n\n\n\u00b1\n15 m, while that between the medium- and low-density fracture zones is at about x\n\n=\n\n\n\u00b1\n35 m. We explicitly represent the distribution of these fractures using the discrete fracture network approach.\n51\n The material properties of intact rocks, fractures, fault core, and water are given in Table\u00a01, which in general resemble those of the Fenton Hill geothermal test site.\n52\n\n,\n\n53\n\n\nWe run the numerical simulation in two consecutive stages. In the first stage, the system arrives at an initial equilibrium state at 3.6 km depth under an in-situ stress and pressure condition with the maximum horizontal stress \n\n\n\nS\n\n\nH\n\n\n=\n90\n\nMPa\n\n, the minimum horizontal stress \n\n\n\nS\n\n\nh\n\n\n=\n46\n\nMPa\n\n, and the pore fluid pressure \n\n\n\np\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n31\n\nMPa\n\n (i.e.\u00a0sub-hydrostatic\n52\n by about 5 MPa) at the boundaries of the simulation domain. We consider three orientations of the stress field, with \n\n\nS\n\n\nH\n\n\n pointed clockwise with respect to the \nx\n-axis at an angle of \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 90\u00b0. In the second stage, water is injected at a constant rate of q\n\n=\n 2\u00a0\n\u00d7\n\u00a010\u22124 m2\/s (i.e.\u00a0120 L\/min) for up to 1 h into the fault zone and three locations of injection point are considered, i.e.\u00a0\n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n, 25, and 45 m. In addition, we set six monitoring points at different distances away from the fault core, i.e.\u00a0\n\n\n\nx\n\n\nmon\n\n\n=\n0\n\n, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 m. A constant pressure equal to the initial reservoir pressure is assumed for the four domain boundaries.\n\nThe spatial domain is discretised using an unstructured grid with the average element size \n\nh\n=\n1\n\n m. The time domain evolution is solved using an adaptive stepping scheme constrained by a predefined maximum time step of \n\n\u0394\n\n\nt\n\n\nmax\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n01\n\n hr and a tolerance of 0.01 (for controlling relative errors), to guarantee numerical convergence and stability. If the tolerance criterion is not met, the solver will automatically decrease the time step by half and reiterate again until a convergence is achieved; otherwise, the time step will be reduced further. At the beginning of the second stage calculation, the time step is set at a very small initial value of \n\n\u0394\n\n\nt\n\n\nini\n\n\n=\n1\n\u00d7\n\n10\u22126 h, which then progressively increases (or decreases) depending on the convergence condition but staying below \n\n\u0394\n\n\nt\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n.\nIt is worth clarifying that, in the current research, we limit our scope to focus on the injection-induced multiphysical processes and microseismic events in the decametre\/hectometre-scale fractured rock of the fault zone. We do not aim to capture the reactivation of the entire fault zone, whose characteristic length may extend much beyond our model domain. However, we do consider the shear dislocation along the fault core (represented as a thin layer with its mechanical properties defined in Table\u00a01) within the modelled domain as well as its consequences on the nearby stress field, which may affect the activation of mesoscale fractures and the evolution of new damages. The permeability of the fault core is assumed constant and at a very low value (1\u00a0\n\u00d7\n\u00a010\u221220 m2), reflecting the possible behaviour of fine-grained, clay-rich gouge materials in a mature fault zone.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults and analysis\n\n4.1\nInjection-induced pressure evolution\nWe present the spatial and temporal evolution of fluid pressure in the fault zone subject to fluid injection at different positions, where the in-situ stress field has an orientation of \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 0\u00b0(Fig.\u00a02), 45\u00b0(Fig.\u00a03), or 90\u00b0(Fig.\u00a04). We also analyse the temporal variations of fluid pressure at the injection point and six monitoring points (Fig.\u00a05). It is useful to note here that the pressure evolution in Fig.\u00a05 reflects both the effects of pressure propagation in the variable-density, anisotropic fracture network and of the pressure-induced fracture aperture changes and creation of new fractures (new damage elements) in the network. The latter effect will be presented in detail in Section\u00a04.2.\nFor the case of \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 0\u00b0, when the injection point is close to the fault core, i.e.\u00a0\n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n m (Fig.\u00a03, left panel), injected water flows mainly in the right portion of the fault zone and in general along the strike of the fault. This is because the fault core serves as a low-permeability barrier to prevent the injected water from migrating to the left space, while the high-density fracture zone surrounding the fault core acts as a highly-conductive corridor for fluid flow along the fault strike. Correspondingly, the pressure at the injection point experiences a progressive and moderate increase during the entire injection period (Fig.\u00a05a). The monitoring points #1 and #2 (i.e.\u00a0\n\n\n\nx\n\n\nmon\n\n\n=\n0\n\n and 10 m, respectively) inside the high-density fracture zone show pressure responses from the early stage; the monitoring points #3 and #4 inside the medium-density fracture zone only witness some small increase in the very late stage; the monitoring points #5 and #6 inside the low-density fracture zone experience very little pressure change (Fig.\u00a05a). This is consistent with the observation in Fig.\u00a02 that the injected water first flows along the strike in the high-density fracture zone, and then later also diffuses towards right into the medium-density fracture zone. When the injection position is at \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n25\n\n m, which is in the medium-density fracture zone but still in a good connection to the near-core high-density zone, injected water first flows towards the fault core and then spreads along the fault strike (Fig.\u00a02, middle panel). The pressure at the injection point quickly climbs up to about 55 MPa and then starts to decline after a short plateau, while the neighbouring monitoring point #3 left to the injection point shows a similar trend, indicating a preferential pressure diffusion towards the high-density fracture zone (Fig.\u00a05b). Other monitoring points inside the high- and medium-density fracture zones also sequentially experience gentle pressure increases, while those inside the low-density zone witness insignificant variations (Fig.\u00a05b). When \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n45\n\n m, the injection point is in the low-density fracture zone where fractures are sparsely distributed and have a poor connectivity. At the beginning, the pressure builds up only around the injection point, which is followed by diffusion into the medium- and high-density fracture zones in the later stage as more water is continuously injected into the system (Fig.\u00a02, right panel). The pressure at the injection point shows a steep build-up in the early stage, and then a decline asymptotically reaching a stabilisation in the later stage (Fig.\u00a05c). The monitoring points #1-#5 left to the injection point consecutively capture pressure responses, while the one (i.e.\u00a0#6) right to the injection point only has a minor pressure variation (Fig.\u00a05c). It is interesting to notice that the eventual pressure level seems to stabilise slightly above 40 MPa, irrespectively of the injection position (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013c), indicating that the pressure field in the fault zone after certain period of injection and stimulation is dominated by the same flow structures (i.e.\u00a0high-density fracture zone) as can be also seen in Fig.\u00a02.\nFor the case of \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 45\u00b0, when \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n m (Fig.\u00a03, left panel), fluid pressure builds up locally around the injection point and forms a concentrated high-pressure zone obliquely oriented at about 45\u00b0clockwise with respect to the \nx\n-axis. This is because, under the given in-situ stress state, the 45\u00b0fracture set parallel to the maximum principal stress tends to be more open (or less closed), while the 135\u00b0fracture set is more compressed for closure. Thus, the pressure tends to preferentially develop along the 45\u00b0direction, while only slowly diffuse laterally into the 135\u00b0direction. Correspondingly, the pressure at the injection point shows a sharp increase when the injection starts, which is caught up by the two monitoring points #1 and #2 nearby (Fig.\u00a05d). All the other monitoring points #3-#6 show negligible pressure signals, indicating that the pressure build-up occurs only in the vicinity of the injection point. When \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n25\n\n m (Fig.\u00a03, middle panel), even stronger pressure build-up occurs (compared to that of \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n m) around the injection point in the early stage, because the surrounding rock is embedded with a medium density of fractures. The injected water then manages to flow towards the left along the 45\u00b0direction into the high-density fracture zone, accompanied by a relaxation of the pressure concentration. The pressure at the injection point thus first increases abruptly, then decreases, and finally arrives at a plateau at later time (Fig.\u00a05e). Only the monitoring point #3 at the nearest left of the injection point captures a pressure response, while the other monitoring points show minor or even little variations (Fig.\u00a05e), due to the offset of the obliquely-oriented flow pathway. When \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n45\n\n m (Fig.\u00a03, right panel), a narrow high-pressure zone forms during the fluid injection that extends along the 45\u00b0direction and eventually connects to the high-density fracture zone, after which the pressure becomes relaxed. The pressure at the injection point experiences a steep increase to above 90 MPa and immediately a quick drop to about 55 MPa in the early stage, followed by a gentle decline during the remaining period (Fig.\u00a05f). Only minor signals are observed at the neighbouring monitoring points #5 and #6, while all the other monitoring points do not experience significant pressure variations (Fig.\u00a05f).\nFor the case of \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 90\u00b0, when \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n m (Fig.\u00a04, left panel), fluid pressure only marginally builds up around the injection point and diffuses fast along the fault strike. It can be evidently seen in Fig.\u00a05g that the pressure at the injection point only increases by less than 10 MPa and the pressure at the nearby monitoring points #1-#3 also only experiences some minor increases. Very similar behaviour of pressure spatio-temporal evolution is observed when \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n25\n\n m (Fig.\u00a04, middle panel; Fig.\u00a05h), which may be attributed to the fact that the injection point still has a good hydraulic connection to the high-density fracture zone. When \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n45\n\n m (Fig.\u00a04, right panel), pressure only builds up around the injection point and the high-pressure zone attempts to grow along the y direction, i.e.\u00a0the maximum principal stress orientation. The pressure at the injection point builds up quickly to about 50 MPa after a short period of injection and then levels off in the later time. Significant pressure responses are seen at the two monitoring points #5 and #6 nearby. Interestingly, at #5, a negative pressure variation occurs, followed by a sharp increase and then a plateau, which is attributed to the poroelastic effect and damage propagation. Specifically, ahead of a propagating new crack driven by tensile failure, the rock is expected to be under an extensional stress state; due to the undrained condition of the low-permeability matrix, a pressure decrease would occur as a result of the poroelastic effect (a detailed explanation on this phenomenon can be found in our previous publication\n33\n). Some pressure increase is also seen at the monitoring point #4 in the very late stage, while the other monitoring points #1-#3 experience little pressure response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nInjection-induced geomechanical responses\nWe then investigate the injection-induced geomechanical responses of the fractured rock of the fault zone with respect to damage propagation, shear dislocation, and aperture variation.\n\nFig.\u00a06 shows the final pattern of injection-induced new damages in the system for different stress and injection scenarios, while Fig.\u00a07 shows the temporal evolution of the damages (failed in tensile or shear mode) during the constant flow-rate injection, together with the variation in the injection fluid pressure. A general observation of interest may be made here. The results show that tensile fracturing may be found when the injection pressure is below the minimum horizontal stress \n\n\nS\n\n\nh\n\n\n of 46 MPa that is imposed on the domain boundary. This is due to mechanical interference between fractures in the network which may cause the local normal stress on the fractures to be significantly different from the boundary stresses.\n41\n Generally, the injection pressure variation displayed in Fig.\u00a07 is a reflection of both fracture aperture changes due to tensile deformation and shear dilation and the new damages that may connect existing fractures in the network. The latter is expected to be relatively more important for injection in the low density fracture region (Fig.\u00a07c, f and i) with sudden drops in injection pressure probably due to new fracture connections being established.\nFor \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 0\u00b0, if the injection point is inside the high-density fracture zone, very little damage emerges in the system (Figs. 6a and a). As the injection point moves away from the fault core, more and more damages are generated (Fig.\u00a06b\u2013c and Fig.\u00a07b\u2013c). These new damages mainly develop along the x direction, i.e.\u00a0the maximum principal stress direction (Fig.\u00a06a\u2013c), and are dominated by tensile failure (Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c). It can be seen that damages temporally cluster in the period when the pressure at the injection point is high, because the high pressure built up locally promotes the growth of new damages to connect to the high-density fracture zone, after which the water manages to dissipate and less damages are produced. For \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 45\u00b0, considerable damages along the 45\u00b0direction are generated in the system, which becomes more significant as the distance of the injection point to the fault core increases (Fig.\u00a06d\u2013f). The damages are more clustered in the early time window if \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n m (Fig.\u00a07d), but become more temporally distributed if \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n25\n\n m or 45 m (Fig.\u00a07e-f), indicating more sustained damage propagation occurs as the injection position moves away from the fault core. The damages are still dominated by tensile failure but more shear-mode damages occur compared to the case of \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 0\u00b0. Note that some minor damages that appear close to the top boundary may be related to the boundary effect as a result of the finite size of the model domain. For \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 90\u00b0, little damage emerges in the system if the injection position is at \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n m or 25 m (Fig.\u00a06g\u2013h and Fig.\u00a07g\u2013h), since the pressure does not really build up much in these cases. However, if water is injected at \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n45\n\n m, extensive new damages (dominated by tensile failure but also involve certain amount of shear failure) develop spatially parallel to the fault strike (Fig.\u00a06i) and temporally in a sustained manner (Fig.\u00a07i).\n\n\n\nFigs.\u00a08 and 9 show the spatial distributions of induced shear displacements and aperture enlargements of pre-existing fractures at the end of the injection. For \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 0\u00b0, fractures are preferentially oriented for shearing, such that significant shear displacements develop in the system. The region of large shear displacements shows a triangular pattern pointing towards right (Fig.\u00a08a\u2013c), resulting from the combined effects of dominant flow in the high-density fracture zone along the fault strike, lateral diffusion into the medium-density fracture zone, and obstruction of flow into left portion of the fault zone by the low-permeability core. Fractures inside the medium-density fracture zone seem to accommodate the largest shear displacements, whereas those close inside the high-density fracture zone exhibit less shearing due to possibly less pressure build-up. The shear stimulated zone becomes slightly larger and stretched towards right as the injection point moves away from the fault core (Fig.\u00a08a\u2013c). Fracture aperture enlargement shows a similar pattern as the shear displacement (Fig.\u00a09a\u2013c) since the aperture change is dominated by shear-induced dilation. For \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 45\u00b0, fractures are strongly suppressed for shearing and opening even in the high-density fracture zone (Fig.\u00a08d\u2013f and Fig.\u00a09d\u2013f), whereas only moderate shear displacements and aperture enlargements occur within a narrow band (oriented at 45\u00b0), where high pressure and intense damage develop (Fig.\u00a03 and Fig.\u00a06d\u2013f). For \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 90\u00b0, if the injection point is at \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n m or 25 m, fractures in the high-density fracture zone are reactivated for moderate shearing (Fig.\u00a08g\u2013h) and aperture enlargements (Fig.\u00a09g\u2013h), whereas some of those in the medium-density fracture zone tend to be more stimulated. If the injection point is at \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n45\n\n m, a large number of fractures away from the fault core are significantly sheared (Fig.\u00a08i) and dilated (Fig.\u00a09i).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nInjection-induced seismicity occurrence\nWe show the spatial distribution of induced seismicity in the fault zone subject to different in-situ stress orientations and fluid injection at different positions (Fig.\u00a010). The moment magnitude is calculated based on the cumulative seismic moment from the beginning of the injection to the end. Note that the moment magnitude calculated and shown here aims for a first-order estimation indicative of the possible seismic behaviour of the fracture system. It can be seen that the microseismic clouds mainly cluster in the right space of the fault zone, where the fractured rock is pressurised by the injected water. Surprisingly, even if injected water is inhibited for flowing across the low-permeability fault core, a small amount of seismicity also occurs in the unpressurised left space, which may be caused by poroelastic stressing across the fault core from the right side. For \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 0\u00b0, the microseismic clouds show a triangular pattern with larger events attempting to emerge at locations away from the fault core (Fig.\u00a010a\u2013c). As the injection point moves farther from the fault core, more microseismic events occur with increased magnitudes, as a result of more pressure build-up and thus more fracture reactivation. For \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 45\u00b0, microseismic clouds tend to localise into a narrow band oriented at 45\u00b0, and the seismically active area seems to be much smaller than that of \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 0\u00b0. This is because the seismicity is dominated by the frictional sliding of pre-existing fractures, which are highly suppressed if the stress field is oriented at \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 45\u00b0. For \n\u03b8\n\n\n=\n 90\u00b0, if \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n5\n\n m or 25 m, microseismic clouds mainly develop along the fault strike with relatively small magnitudes; however, if \n\n\n\nx\n\n\ninj\n\n\n=\n45\n\n m, extensive seismic events of large magnitudes are generated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nIn this paper, we applied a fully-coupled hydro-mechanical model to simulate injection-induced processes in a mature fault zone characterised by a low-permeability fault core and a high-permeability damage zone bounding the fault core. Many essential multiphysical processes were modelled including pressure diffusion, poroelastic coupling, brittle failure, fracture slip, aperture variation, and microseismicity occurrence. Our model realistically captured the phenomena that the fault core prevents the injected water from flowing across it and that the damage zone promotes fluid flow along the fault strike, consistent with many field observations and other numerical simulations.\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n\n,\n\n9\n\n,\n\n27\u201329\n Our simulations show that the injection-induced deformation\/seismicity inside the fault zone is controlled by (a) the state of in-situ stresses and its orientation relative to the fault direction, (b) the distribution of fractures within the fault zone and the orientations of prevalent fracture sets relative to principal stress directions, and (c) the location of injection point within such a hierarchically-organised system. Injection-induced new damages tend to propagate along the maximum principal stress direction, while shear displacements and aperture enlargements are promoted when fractures are preferentially oriented for shearing under the in-situ stress condition. Constant-rate fluid injection into the densely fractured region close to the fault core results in relatively lower pressures and thus tends to produce little damage and insignificant connectivity change, while injection into a region of relatively low fracture density involves a higher injection pressure and seems to gain slightly increased connectivity accompanied by increased microseismicity. However, if the stress field is oriented to suppress the fractures for shearing, a significant connectivity enhancement may be gained with an insignificant level of microseismicity created, especially if the injection point is located away from the fault core (but still inside the fault zone). Great caution is also needed for such a scenario, which may generate a direct hydraulic connection linking the injection point to the main fault with a risk of eventually reactivating the main fault. The observations obtained from the current study may have important implications for the design and optimisation of hydraulic stimulation strategies for enhanced geothermal or hydrocarbon recovery. More specifically, our results suggest that a comprehensive site characterisation of the in-situ stress state and mesoscale damage zone structures is essential for evaluating and predicting the stimulation performance of rock volumes in natural fault zones.\nOur research revealed the metre or decametre-scale complexity of injection-induced phenomena in fault zones, which are often neglected in most existing simulation studies \n23\u201328\n without considering the detailed distribution and behaviour of fractures inside the damage zone. Here, we conducted physics-based numerical simulations to show that the seismo-hydro-mechanical evolution inside the fault zone can exhibit qualitatively different regimes depending on the fracture-stress relative orientation, local fracture density, and the injection position, which may not be captured by commonly assumed constitutive relationships empirically relating fault zone porosity\/permeability to local stress variation. \n23\n\n,\n\n29\n The conventional fault models that represent a fault as a single plane or a multilayer composite (see the review in the introduction section) are computationally efficient in capturing the overall reactivation behaviour of large-scale faults. However, we would like to emphasise that it is also fundamentally important to investigate the mesoscale physical processes and phenomena that occur within the fault in order to better understand the emergence of its macroscopic behaviour\/properties. For example, it is of great interest to examine whether and how microseismic events developed in the damage zone could possibly cascade into a much larger event.\n54\n In the current study, we mainly focused on the processes operating in the mesoscale fracture system of the damage zone and did not attempt to fully capture the reactivation of the main fault, for which a much larger modelling domain is needed \u2014\u00a0an aspect that will be explored in our future work. Our modelling results of injection-induced microseismic clouds are in a good consistency with the field observations obtained from decametre-scale in-situ hydraulic stimulation experiments at the Grimsel Test Site, Switzerland,\n30\n\n,\n\n31\n where extensive microseismic events were found to occur in the off-fault damage zone. More specifically, at the Grimsel Test Site, the fault zones involved in the stimulation experiments were found to have a narrow (centimetre-wide) fault core,\n11\n while the injection-induced microseismic clouds developed in the off-fault region with a lateral extent of several tens of centimetres to metres.\n30\n\n,\n\n31\n These microseismic clusters tend to align the strike of the main fault plane,\n30\n\n,\n\n31\n which is laterally bounded by a damage zone characterised by mesoscale fractures with a spatial decay of fracture density away from the fault core.\n11\n The field experimental results have shown that the injection-induced seismicity neither occurred in the fault core nor on the interface between the fault core and the damage zone; basically, the seismicity occurred exclusively inside the damage zone,\n31\n consistent with our model concept and simulation results.\nIt is worth mentioning a few limitations of the current work which require more efforts to overcome through additional studies in the future. In the current study, we mainly explored the effect of stress orientation and focused on a fracture system with a constant length; it would be interesting to also study the effects of stress magnitudes and variable fracture lengths on the seismicity in fault zones. It is also important to extend the current 2D model to 3D so that the role of the intermediate stress component can be explored. Furthermore, we hope to further develop and apply our model to study the phenomena of post-injection large magnitude earthquakes\n55\u201357\n and Kaiser effect\n58\n\n,\n\n59\n that have been observed in many previous injection projects.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nTo conclude, we have presented fully-coupled hydro-mechanical simulations of fluid injection into a fault zone consisting of a fault core and a damage zone characterised by an exponential decay of fracture density away from the fault core. We found that the injection-induced seismo-hydro-mechanical responses of the fault zone including pressure diffusion, damage growth, fracture deformation, and microseismicity emergence are interactively controlled by the in-situ stress field and its orientation relative to the fault, the fracture distribution within the fault zone and the prevalent directions of fracture sets, and injection position relative to the local fracture density in the fault zone. In general, a higher enhancement in connectivity as well as a greater potential for fracture slip in the network with a higher seismicity level is generated when injecting water into the damage zone at a location away from the fault core. If the injection location is very close to the fault core, the high local fracture density prevents high pressure build up, and if the injection is far from the fault core in the low-density fracture region, significant pressure build-up could occur. Furthermore, the seismicity may be suppressed if the fractures are unfavourably oriented for shearing under the in-situ stress field. Our results highlight the complexity of injection-induced metre-scale multiphysical processes in hierarchical fault zones, which were often overlooked in the literature. Our research findings may have important implications for optimising the stimulation strategy of enhanced geothermal systems and unconventional oil\/gas reservoirs as well as forecasting the emergence of large man-made earthquakes during injection-related geoengineering activities.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nQinghua Lei: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft.

Particularly, a fundamental understanding of fluid flow and solute transport in single rock fractures is essential for analysing mass and energy transport in fracture networks at the field application scale.\nRock fractures are deformable subject to normal and shear stresses (e.g., Ref.\u00a06). It is known that the transmissivity of rock fractures is determined by the structure of void spaces, i.e.,\u00a0fracture aperture (e.g., Refs.\u00a07, 8). In the literature, numerous studies have revealed that mechanical processes, i.e.,\u00a0normal and shear displacements, significantly affect the fracture transmissivity because the mechanical displacements can change the fracture aperture structures (e.g., Refs.\u00a07, 9\u201328). For instance, Yeo et al.\n13\n conducted physical shear-flow experiments and found that with increasing shear displacement from 0\u00a0mm to 2\u00a0mm, the fracture becomes more permeable, and the flow becomes more heterogeneous and anisotropic. Xiong et al.\n19\n conducted laboratory shear-flow tests and numerical simulations by solving the Navier\u2013Stokes equation to study the changes of hydraulic properties of a single fracture during shear. It was found that the evolution of fracture transmissivity decreases before the peak shear stress and then increase after the peak shear stress. These studies generally demonstrated the significant impact of mechanical displacement on the changes of fracture transmissivity.\nThe changes of fracture transmissivity induced by mechanical displacements will subsequently affect solute transport processes in the fractures (e.g., Refs.\u00a028\u201338). In particular, Koyama et al.\n39\n and Vilarrasa et al.\n29\n analysed shear-induced flow channels and their impact on solute transport in a fracture created from a laser scanned rock surface. It was found that fracture shear greatly increases the flow rate and particle travel velocity in the direction perpendicular to the shearing direction. The shear process is often numerically approximated by conducting incremental relative movement of the upper surface without considering normal loading. In reality, natural fractures are subject to complex mechanical conditions including both normal and shear stresses. Therefore, to understand the coupled hydromechanical and solute transport processes in rock fractures, it is important to quantify the normal and shear displacements in analysis of fluid flow and solute transport considering the more realistic mechanical conditions. Recently, Zhang and Huang\n40\n and Liu et al.\n41\n simulated solute transport in rough fractures by solving the advection\u2013dispersion equation with consideration of more accurate shear displacement obtained from direct shear test of artificial rock fractures under constant normal loading boundary conditions. Their results showed that the shear displacements cause significant increase (in the magnitude) of flow rates and solute velocity. At present, the analyses of solute transport in sheared fractures are limited to a few direct shear test results without considering different mechanical boundary conditions. Meanwhile, modelling solute transport in rock fractures by solving the Reynolds equation and dimension-reduced advection\u2013dispersion equation may contain important uncertainty because of the selection of constant values of longitudinal and transverse dispersivity.\nIn this work, we investigate the impact of shear displacement on advective transport in a single rough-walled fracture. We study different mechanical scenarios based on a set of high-resolution laboratory shear tests for a fracture with different replicas under constant normal load (CNL) and constant normal stiffness (CNS) conditions. The shear tests with replicas of the same natural fracture provides important advantages to study the effect of different mechanical boundary conditions on the shear-flow-transport processes in the fracture. The evolution of fracture aperture structures with different shear displacement conditions is extracted from measured normal displacements and the digitalized fracture surface. The fluid flow is simulated by solving the Reynolds equation. The Lagrangian particle tracking method is applied to model the advective transport in the fracture. The results from this study will help to improve our understanding of stress-dependent solute transport processes in natural rock fractures under different mechanical boundary conditions.\n\n\n2\nLaboratory shear tests and simulation methods\n\n2.1\nLaboratory shear tests\nA set of high-resolution laboratory shear test data is used to analyse the fracture aperture changes induced by realistic mechanical conditions. In the laboratory test, five replicas of a nature granite fracture sample of size 70\u00a0mm \n\u00d7\n100\u00a0mm created using a special high-strength concrete (the Young\u2019s modulus is around 61.35 GPa, the Poisson ratio is around 0.26 and the unconfined compressive strength is around 186.8 MPa) were adopted to conduct shear tests under CNL and CNS conditions. Fig.\u00a01 presents the digitalized rock surfaces of the granite fracture sample.\n\nThe extended root-mean-square of the first derivatives of asperity heights for three-dimensional surfaces (\n\n\nZ\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\nD\n\n\n) is used to characterize the surface roughness. The \n\n\nZ\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\nD\n\n\n for a surface represented by Z(x, y) is the average slope magnitude based on the local slopes along both x and y directions, expressed as\n43\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\nD\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nN\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\nN\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nz\n\n\ni\n+\n1\n,\nj\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nz\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n+\n1\n,\nj\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nz\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n+\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nz\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n+\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\ny\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nN\n\n\nx\n\n\n and \n\n\nN\n\n\ny\n\n\n are the number of points along x and y directions for the surface, respectively. The \n\n\nZ\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\nD\n\n\n for the upper and lower surface are 0.315 and 0.337, respectively.\nFor simplicity, these fracture replicas are created based on the lower surface of the natural granite rock fracture sample, so that the upper and lower surfaces of these replicas are perfectly mated initially. In the CNL shear test, the normal stress is 5 MPa. Four CNS shear tests were conducted to which the effective normal stiffness approach was applied to reduce the normal load error.\n42\n The initial normal stress is 5 MPa, the system normal stiffness 61.9 MPa\/mm (derived from normal loading tests in the interval 35\u00a0\u2013\u00a070 KN corresponding to 5\u00a0\u2013\u00a010 MPa) and the intended normal stiffness are 2 (2.1) MPa\/mm, 5 (5.4) MPa\/mm, 10 (11.9) MPa\/mm and 15 (19.8) MPa\/mm, respectively, with the applied effective normal stiffness in parentheses. All tests were carried out at a shear displacement rate of 0.5\u00a0mm\/min. The replicas made it possible to conduct shear tests under different mechanical conditions while maintaining similar geometrical conditions (i.e.,\u00a0fracture surface roughness).\nIn all shear tests, four linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) sensors are placed near the four corners of the sample to measure the vertical displacements and to detect the potential rotation of the upper surface during the shearing process. In our analysis, the averaged normal displacements from the four LVDT sensors are used to determine the evolution of the aperture structures during the test.\n\n\n2.2\nDetermination of aperture structure\nFor initially mated fractures, the aperture structure is mainly controlled by the shear displacement and the normal displacement that is caused by shear dilation. Assuming that the mated fracture surface is noted by Z(x, y), the aperture field b(x, y) after shear can be determined by \n\n(2)\n\n\nb\n\n\nx\n,\ny\n\n\n=\nZ\n\n\nx\n,\ny\n\u2212\ns\n\n\n\u2212\nZ\n\n\nx\n,\ny\n\n\n+\nd\n\n\n\nwhere s is the shear displacement and d is the normal displacement due to shear dilation. In the laboratory shear tests, the shear is conducted along the fracture length (i.e.,\u00a0the opposite direction of the \ny\n-axis shown in Fig.\u00a01b). Note that small-scale fracture asperities could damage and then produce gouge particles during the shear tests, which is not included in Eq.\u00a0(2) of the present study. The potential impacts of gouge particles on solute transport are further discussed in Section\u00a04.2.\n\n\n2.3\nSimulation method for groundwater flow\nAssuming that the cubic law is applicable locally, groundwater flow in rock fractures can be described by the Reynolds equation (e.g., Ref.\u00a044). The Reynolds equation has been widely applied in modelling of groundwater flow and solute transport in rock fractures due to its simplicity and ability to account for surface roughness, which is expressed as \n\n(3)\n\n\n\u2207\n\u22c5\n\n\n\u03c1\ngb\n\n\n\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n12\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u2207\nH\n=\n0\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03c1\n\n[\nkg\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n3\n\n\n]\n\n\nis\u00a0the\u00a0fluid\u00a0density\n,\n\ng\n\n[\nm\n\/\n\n\ns\n\n\n2\n\n\n]\n\n\n is the acceleration of gravity, b(x, y) is the fracture aperture structure after shear, \n\nH\n\n[\nm\n]\n\n\n is the hydraulic head, and \n\n\u03bc\n\n\n[\nPa\n\n\ns\n]\n\n\n is the dynamic viscosity of water. The Reynolds equation is valid only for laminar flow conditions when the Reynolds number is relatively small (much smaller than 1). In the present study, Dirichlet boundary conditions are adopted for flow simulations, where the overall hydraulic gradient between the inlet and outlet boundaries is set at 0.01.\nA finite element method (FEM) code is developed to solve the Reynolds equation and to obtain the flow field.\n28\n A structured mesh with bilinear quadrilateral elements is adopted for finite element discretization and simulation. The element size of the structured mesh is 0.2\u00a0mm \n\u00d7\n 0.2\u00a0mm. The bilinear quadrilateral elements rather than the linear triangular elements are used to avoid constant gradients at each linear triangular element. The Gaussian quadrature method using four integration points are adopted in the FEM code. The local aperture \n\nb\n\n(\nx\n,\n\ny\n)\n\n\n at each integration point is interpolated from the four nodes of an element. By solving Eq.\u00a0(3), we can obtain the hydraulic head. After that, the flow velocity field can be calculated by \n\n(4)\n\n\nu\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c1\ngb\n\n\n\n(\nx\n,\n\ny\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n12\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u2207\nH\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nu\n\n[\nm\n\/\ns\n]\n\n\n is the velocity vector.\n\n\n2.4\nSimulation method for advective transport\nAfter solving flow velocity fields, a Lagrangian particle tracking approach is used to model the advective transport in the fractures (e.g., Ref.\u00a045). Although transport in rock fractures often involves other mechanisms, such as dispersion, matrix diffusion, sorption, decay and reaction,\n46\n we choose to focus on the advection in this work because the advection is the dominant transport mechanism for large-scale pollutant spreading in rock fractures, for instance, when considering radionuclide migration from repository sites. The Lagrangian particle tracking method has unique advantages compared to mesh-based Eulerian methods (such as finite difference, finite element and finite volume methods) to model advective transport processes since it avoids errors caused by numerical dispersion. In this Lagrangian particle tracking approach, the travel times for released particles in the fracture are calculated from the flow streamlines. For each particle, the flow streamline\/trajectory is described by the Lagrangian position vector, \n\nX\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n, as a function of time, that is \n\nX\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\n[\nx\n\n\nt\n\n\n,\ny\n\n\nt\n\n\n]\n\n\n. Taking the case when the flow is along the \nx\n-axis direction, the travel time \n\u03c4\n for a particle from the release point (\n\nx\n=\n0\n\n) to the control plane (\n\nx\n=\nL\n\n) can be calculated by \n\n(5)\n\n\n\u03c4\n=\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\n0\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n[\nX\n\n(\n\u03c4\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n)\n\n]\n\n\n\n\u2248\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nx\ni\n\n\n\n[\nX\n\n(\n\u03c4\n\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n)\n\n)\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\n\n is the velocity in the \nx\n-axis direction and the total travel time \n\u03c4\n is the sum of travel time at each step \ni\n when a particle is advected with a distance \n\n\u0394\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n. More detailed information on the particle tracking method can be found in Cvetkovic et al.\n45\n, Zou\n47\n and Zou and Cvetkovic\n28\n.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nShear test results\n\nFig.\u00a02 illustrates the changes of shear stress and normal stress (Fig.\u00a02a) and the averaged normal displacement (Fig.\u00a02b) with the shear displacement during laboratory shear testing of the replica samples. The results show that the shear stresses increase dramatically with the increasing shear displacement until they reach the peak shear strengths when the shear displacements are around 0.24\u00a0mm, 0.32\u00a0mm, 0.32\u00a0mm, 0.4\u00a0mm, and 0.34\u00a0mm for the one CNL and the four CNS tests, respectively. Then, under the CNL condition, once residual state has been reached, the shear stress remains constant with increasing shear displacement. However, under the CNS condition, the normal stresses continuously increase with the shear displacement and the shear stresses gradually increase with the increasing shear displacement after a dropdown when the shear displacements are below 1\u00a0mm. Meanwhile, the averaged normal displacements obtained from four LVDT sensors show that the fracture slightly closes before the shear stresses approach their peak shear strengths. After that, the fracture gradually opens with increasing shear displacement due to shear dilation. These features commonly appear in direct shear tests of rock fractures (e.g., Refs.\u00a015, 19).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nFracture aperture changes caused by shear displacement\n\nFig.\u00a03 illustrates fracture aperture distributions for different shear displacements under CNL and CNS conditions. To avoid the potential boundary effects on the aperture analysis, the central part of the fracture after shear with a size of 65\u00a0mm \n\u00d7\n85\u00a0mm is selected for analysis of aperture structures and for conducting flow and transport simulations. The histogram distributions and statistics of the fracture apertures for different shear displacements under CNL and CNS conditions are presented in Fig.\u00a04, for statistical characterization of the fracture aperture changes caused by the mechanical displacements during the shear test.\n\nObviously, the shear displacements dramatically affect the aperture structures for all cases. Specifically, the fractures are largely closed due to the normal closure when the shear stress approaches the peak shear strengths, especially for the case of CNL shear test. When the shear displacement increases to 1\u00a0mm and 5\u00a0mm, the fracture opens, and the contact areas gradually reduce and become more concentrated. The aperture distributions also vary among different mechanical conditions at the same shear displacement. This result indicates that up to the peak shear strength, even if the replicas are similar, tiny differences in fracture geometry and mechanical conditions have a large effect on the shear dilation behaviour and therefore on the aperture field. For larger shear displacements (1\u00a0mm and 5\u00a0mm in this case), the mechanical conditions directly control the dilation behaviour and the aperture structures.\n\nFig.\u00a04 presents histogram distributions and statistics of the fracture apertures for different shear displacements under different CNL and CNS conditions (exemplified by the cases with CNL, \n\n\u03c3\n=\n5\n\n MPa, and CNS, \n\n\n\nK\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n2\n\n MPa\/mm and 15 MPa\/mm). In Fig.\u00a04, zero values of the aperture represent the contact ratio (i.e.,\u00a0ratio between the contact areas and the total projected fracture area). For the cases with CNL, \n\n\u03c3\n=\n5\n\n MPa, and CNS, \n\n\n\nK\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n2\n\n MPa\/mm, the contact ratios are relatively high (48% and 58%) and the mean aperture is relatively small (0.03\u00a0mm) when the shear displacements are 0.24\u00a0mm and 0.32\u00a0mm, respectively, where the shear stress is approximately at the peak shear strength. For the case with CNS, \n\n\n\nK\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n15\n\n MPa\/mm, the contact ratio is smaller than for the previous two cases and the mean aperture is relatively larger (0.11\u00a0mm).\n\nIn all cases, the mean aperture significantly increases with the increasing shear displacements. The coefficients of variation (CV) gradually decrease with the increasing shear displacements for these exemplified cases, except the case with \n\nCNS\n,\n15\n\n\nMPa\n\/\nmm\n\n. The statistical results quantitatively show that the fracture apertures change during the shearing process. The specific changes of mean apertures and CV vary in different cases with different normal stress (stiffness) conditions.\n\n\n3.3\nFlow streamlines\nThe fracture apertures after shearing to different distances are determined by\u00a0Eq.\u00a0(2), where the shear dilations are obtained from the measured normal displacements. Fluid flow in both x- and \ny\n-axis directions are simulated by solving equation (3) based on the obtained fracture apertures. To show the flow streamlines and subsequently simulate advective transport in the fractures using the particle tracking method, around 850 and 650 particles (the interval between two nearest particles is 0.1\u00a0mm) are evenly released from the inlet flow boundaries for flow in the x- and \ny\n-axis directions, respectively. The particle numbers are selected after trial-and-error testing to reach convergent statistical distributions of the travel times.\n\nFig.\u00a05 exemplifies the flow streamlines for different shear displacements, i.e.,\u00a00.32\u00a0mm (where the shear stress is at the peak shear strength), 1\u00a0mm and 5\u00a0mm, under the CNS condition when \n\n\n\nK\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n2\n\n MPa\/mm. To illustrate the anisotropy effect, flow in both \nx\n-axis direction (perpendicular to the shear direction) and \ny\n-axis direction (along the shear direction) are simulated. In both directions, the flow streamlines show that the flow becomes less channelized when the shear displacement increases from 0.32\u00a0mm to 5\u00a0mm. When the shear displacement is relatively small where the shear stress is at the peak shear strength, flow is almost below the percolation threshold due to the fracture closure, where the void spaces are disconnected (see Fig.\u00a03), especially in the \ny\n-axis direction. This result indicates that relatively small shear displacements (when the shear stress approaches the peak shear strength) can significantly affect the hydraulic properties of mated fractures, where the fracture apertures are near or below the flow percolation threshold. After the peak shear strength, the flow and transport in the fracture will generally be enhanced with increasing shear displacement due to shear dilation for both CNL and CNS conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\nTravel time distributions for advective transport\nBased on the flow streamlines, the travel time for each particle is calculated based on\u00a0Eq.\u00a0(5). The distributions of the travel times are used to analyse the advective transport features. Fig.\u00a06 illustrates the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs) of advective travel time for different shear displacements under different mechanical conditions.\n\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a06a\u2013b, the median travel times for the cases of shear distance 0.32\u00a0mm, 1\u00a0mm and 5\u00a0mm are around 800 s, 130 s and 13 s for flow in the \nx\n-axis direction and 10060 s, 1458 s and 76 s for flow in the \nx\n-axis direction, respectively. It shows that in both x- and \ny\n-axis directions, the median travel times reduce dramatically when the shear displacement increases from 0.32\u00a0mm to 5\u00a0mm.\nMeanwhile, the tail of the travel time distributions becomes less pronounced when the shear displacement increases from 0.32\u00a0mm to 5\u00a0mm (Fig.\u00a06a\u2013b). This result demonstrates that after the peak shear strength, the increasing shear displacements will dramatically affect advective transport in mated fractures by reducing the travel times. The main reason is that after the peak shear strength, the fracture opens due to shear dilation during the shearing process, which significantly increases the fracture transmissivity.\nThe mechanical conditions will affect the travel time distributions at the same shear displacement (Fig.\u00a06c\u2013d). Specifically, the travel time distributions for the fracture under the CNL condition has relatively smaller variability compared to the cases under the CNS condition, because it has relatively larger dilation when the shear displacement is relatively large (larger than 5\u00a0mm, see Fig.\u00a02b). Under the CNS condition, the travel time distribution for the case \n\n\n\nK\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n2\n\n MPa\/mm has the smallest variability compared to the other cases in the \nx\n-axis direction. In the \ny\n-axis direction, the median travel time generally increases with the increasing \n\n\nK\n\n\nn\n\n\n under CNS conditions.\nThese results demonstrate that advective transport processes in rock fractures are sensitive to the fracture mechanical conditions. In general, the advective travel time is longer in the case with higher \n\n\nK\n\n\nn\n\n\n under the CNS condition when the shear displacement is relatively large, because the higher \n\n\nK\n\n\nn\n\n\n results in smaller shear dilation under the CNS condition. However, when the shear displacement is less than 5\u00a0mm, the vertical displacement does not show a clear tendency among the different mechanical conditions (see Fig.\u00a02b), which indicates that there are uncertain impacts of mechanical conditions on the advective transport in sheared rock fractures.\nMoreover, by comparing the travel time distribution for flow in x- and y- axis directions, it is found that the transport along the shear direction (y-axis direction in this case) is more sensitive to the shear displacement, indicating that the shear displacement is a reason for anisotropic flow and transport in rock fractures.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nIn this work, we demonstrated the impact of shear displacements on fluid flow and advective transport in a laboratory-scale fracture. The analysis of fluid flow and advective transport is based on measured mechanical displacements from a unique set of shear test data for fracture replicas. The fracture replicas made it possible to conduct shear tests under different mechanical conditions while maintaining similar geometrical conditions (i.e.,\u00a0fracture surface roughness). We demonstrated the impacts of normal stiffness on fluid flow and solute transport in rock fractures under the CNS condition, which is an advancement compared to previous studies that only considered a single case with one normal stiffness value (e.g., Refs.\u00a040, 41). The aperture calculation method (Eq.\u00a0(2)) has been frequently used in previous hydromechanical studies of rock fractures, such as by Xiong et al.\n19\n, Zhang and Huang\n40\n and Liu et al.\n41\n The flow and transport modelling method has also been adopted for studying fluid flow and advective transport in rock fractures (e.g., Refs.\u00a029, 31). These previous studies have shown that the method can be successfully applied to analyse the flow and transport processes in shear-induced fractures. The demonstration results have important engineering implications even though many outstanding issues remain in the present study. The related engineering implications and remained outstanding issues are discussed below.\n\n4.1\nEngineering implications\nQuantification of the influence of mechanical displacements on fluid flow and solute transport in fractured rocks is important for many geo-engineering projects, especially for geological disposal of nuclear waste (e.g., Ref.\u00a04). Increases of fracture transmissivity and the associated decreases of advective travel times will cause adverse impact on the safety of nuclear waste isolation. For nearly mated fractures, the peak shear strength has a role as an important threshold for the impact of shear displacement on fluid flow and solute transport behaviour in the fracture. Before the shear stress surpasses the peak shear strength, the fracture can undergo even closure due to the negative shear dilation, as shown in the laboratory shear tests (Fig.\u00a02b). The negative dilation has been widely observed in laboratory shear tests.\n19\n In this case, the relatively small shear displacement has negligible effects on the flow and solute transport, where the flow is mostly below the percolation threshold.\n14\n\n,\n\n48\n After the shear stress surpasses the peak shear strength, the advective travel time decreases with the increasing shear displacement. These results indicate that it is important to characterize the peak shear strength of rock fractures and the in situ mechanical boundary conditions (CNL or CNS) for predicting the changes of fluid flow and advective transport in practice. The present analysis of fluid flow and advective transport are generally consistent with studies by Zhang and Huang\n40\n and Liu et al.\n41\n, where the transport processes were analysed by solving the advection\u2013dispersion equation in sheared rough rock fractures.\n\n\n4.2\nOutstanding issues\nThe potential gouge particles from sheared-off asperities or broken grains\/particles are ignored in determination of the fracture aperture structures in the present study. As a matter of fact, the gouge particles can affect the shear strength and dilation, which in turn, affect the aperture distributions and the flow and transport processes. Although the amount of gouge particles can be collected after the shear test for analysis (e.g., Refs.\u00a035, 36) and the evolution of gouge particles can be observed in micro shear test using X-ray micro-computed tomography technology (e.g., Ref.\u00a036), directly measuring the evolution of gouge particles in rock fractures with representative sample sizes during the shearing process remains a challenge, especially with the coupling of fluid flow and solute transport processes.\nDespite this, Zhao et al.\n35\n showed that the shear-induced asperity damage could reduce the dilation under relatively high normal stress levels (\n\u223c\n10 MPa) and increase surface areas, which could reduce the fluid flow and enhance the solute retardation. The reduced flow and enhanced retardation can play positive roles in avoiding the spreading of the leaked pollutants, e.g.,\u00a0radionuclides. More quantitative analysis of the impact of gouge particles induced by shear on flow and transport is needed to better understand the mechanical effects on transport in rock fractures.\nAnother drawback of the method in calculation of aperture based on measured normal displacement is that the local surface deformation and realistic contact conditions are not included. In addition, the fluid flow and solute transport processes directly depend on the changes of aperture structure. In the long-term, fracture apertures could also be altered by fluid flow and reactive chemical transport processes. To understand the detailed coupling between mechanical displacement and chemical transport processes, more sophisticated mechanical models need to be developed (e.g., Refs.\u00a035, 49, 50), and more rigorous flow models based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations may need to be adopted (e.g., Refs.\u00a026, 27), for the coupling analysis in the future studies.\nLimited by the laboratory-scale fracture size, we only demonstrate the impact of shear displacement on advective transport in a relatively small fracture. To what extent these results are representative for a realistic rock fracture at the field scale remains unknown.\n51\n Quantifying the potential scale effects requires laboratory shear-flow tests with much larger (e.g.,\u00a0at least at metre scales) fracture samples or reliable field tests, which remains an obvious challenge at present. Moreover, since the shear tests are conducted using high-strength concrete replicas, slight geometrical differences among the replicas may exist, which could introduce potential uncertainty in the shear test results. In addition, as a preliminary study, only a single nearly mated fracture and a single level of initial normal stress were considered in this work. The impacts of fracture roughness, fracture matedness and initial normal stress on the shear-flow-transport processes need to be comprehensively studied with a greater number of shear tests and\/or numerical simulations, but also by using more sophisticated shear models.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nNumerical modelling of fracture flow and transport has been carried out based on the results from laboratory shear tests on fracture replica samples under different mechanical boundary conditions. The main conclusions from the presented study are summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe fracture firstly closes before the shear stress approaches the peak shear strength and then opens after surpassing the peak shear strength during the shear process, which results in different flow channelling patterns and travel time distribution features.\n\n\n\u2022\nWhen the shear displacement is relatively small before the shear stress approaches the peak shear strength, the flow and transport in perfectly mated fractures can be significantly affected because flow in the fracture is near the flow percolation threshold. After the peak, the flow and transport will be dramatically enhanced with the increasing shear displacement due to shear dilation.\n\n\n\u2022\nAt the same shear displacement, the fracture aperture is affected by the mechanical boundary conditions, which consequently affect the flow and transport processes. In general, the median advective travel time increases with increasing boundary normal stiffness (CNS condition). At the same initial normal stress, the median advective travel time under the CNS boundary condition is generally longer than that under the CNL boundary condition when the shear displacement is relatively large (larger than 5\u00a0mm).\n\n\n\u2022\nThe impact of shear displacement on the fluid flow and advective transport is direction dependent. The shear displacement has stronger influence on the flow and transport along the shear direction, by causing heterogeneous and anisotropic flow channels.\n\n\n\nThe impacts of fracture roughness, fracture matedness, initial normal stress and evolution of gouge materials on stress-dependent transport processes are important topics for future studies. Particularly, (ongoing) studies using larger-sized fracture samples are needed to comprehensively understand the mechanical effects on flow and transport processes in natural fractured rocks at the field scale.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nLiangchao Zou: Writing \u2013 original draft, Methodology, Software, Investigation.

This can have consequences for different ecosystems and human health.\n1\n The carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology is an effective solution to reduce these emissions of CO\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n.\n2\n This technology allows storing massive amounts of CO2 underground in geological reservoirs.\n3\n\n,\n\n4\n It is important to know the storage capacity of the reservoir, but this highly depends on temperature and pressure. To store CO2 in a supercritical state (scCO2), deep reservoirs present considerably higher capacities than shallower reservoirs with similar pore volumes.\nFurthermore, high pressures and temperatures just above the supercritical point considerably increase the fluid density, and therefore the amount of CO2 that can be stored.\n2\n Other key factors are the porosity and permeability of the reservoir rock. For instance, the \u201cSicily Channel\u201d and \u201cAbruzzi Offshore\u201d reservoirs are candidates for geological storage, with porosities reaching 25.6% and permeability of 358 mD.\n5\n On the other hand, shale formations can also be considered for storage of CO2, as indicated by studies on the SACROC Unit reservoir, since shale rock have porosities of around 10% and permeability of 10\u2013100 mD, ensuring that their sealing capacity can be maintained for decades.\n6\n\n\nThe caprock formation is an impermeable barrier that covers the upper part of the reservoir and prevents CO2 leakage to other geological formations. However, during drilling, the zone near the well is damaged. Existing or drilling-induced faults\/fractures in the caprock could turn into leakage paths of CO2 to upper environments. An annular cement barrier is placed between the steel casing and the rock formation to maintain the wellbore integrity after the drilling fluids are removed.\nSeveral problems arise in this system during CO2 injection, as temperature gradients\n7\n and induced seismic activity.\n8\n These effects change the stress states and can lead to failure of the cement or rock. Furthermore, Class G cement used in the oil industry is chemically unstable against CO2 and scCO\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n.\n9\n Geochemical studies of cement paste show that the advance of carbonic acid through cement paste mainly induces the chemical reaction of portlandite (CH) and hydrated calcium silicates (CSH), and the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CC).\n10\n These chemical reactions induce changes in porosity and the mineral composition of the solid phase. The first reaction of carbonation in cement is between CH and CO2: \n\n(1)\n\n\nCH\n+\nC\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2192\nCC\n+\n\n\nH\n\n\n2\n\n\nO\n\n\n(\nSimplified\n)\n\n\n\n\nIn the absence of CH, the pH level is significantly reduced, allowing the second reaction that consists of the carbonation of the CSH: \n\n(2)\n\n\nThe formation of amorphous silica from CSH could increase porosity, depending on the CSH structure,\n11\n and may reduce structural integrity. Furthermore, CaCO3 precipitated in a water acidified medium in the presence of CO2 is in turn prone to dissolution.\n12\n This dissolution continues until thermodynamic equilibrium is reached,\n13\n increasing porosity, permeability, and reducing compressive strength.\n14\n After complete carbonation and degradation, the cement matrix may result in a porous medium of low resistance, unable to maintain the borehole\u2019s integrity or the ability to seal against external loads.\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n\n\nThe modification of cement to improve some properties is a subject of interest in the cement wellbore industry. The objective is to modify the cement matrix, making it lighter while maintaining high strength and low permeability in its hardened state. New additives such as nanocellulose are being added to the mix to improve the cement properties.\n17\n Nanocellulose can be used as a crack-inhibitor to avoid cement damage and prevent CO2 leakage through the upper formations.\n18\n\n,\n\n19\n Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is a type of nanocellulose obtained from bacteria of the genus Gluconacetobacter. This material is produced by ITPN-UBA-CONICET, and obtained in a more economical and less polluting way than other polymers.\n20\n Nanocellulose is considered a potential additive to improve cement properties, such as mechanical and thermal resistance, and decrease transport phenomena by reducing cement porosity.\n21\u201324\n In turn, its use can be extended in the oil industry in cementing operations.\nThe effect of bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) on the porosity and mechanical behavior of oil well cement paste cured at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure has been recently studied.\n22\n\n,\n\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n Barria et\u00a0al. \n22\n show that BNC increases compressive strength and thermal stability in non-carbonated samples. BNC-cement samples subjected to scCO2 conditions show a density increase and a reduction in porosity. The carbonation degree is reduced; therefore, the mechanical behavior is less affected than non-modified cement.\n25\n Nevertheless, its behavior at different curing conditions like those in a reservoir is unknown.\nTemperatures in the various geological reservoirs (coal beds, deep saline aquifers, or depleted oil and gas reservoirs) can vary depending on the depth at which they are found. In some reservoirs, the temperature can vary from 60 to 160\u00a0\u00b0C,\n27\n being 90\u00a0\u00b0C a value usually used by other authors experimenting with cement.\n28\u201331\n\n\nThis work focuses on the microstructure and mechanical changes of cement pastes with added bacterial nanocellulose and cured at 90\u00a0\u00b0C in the context of CO2 reservoir conditions. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultrasonic wave velocity measurement, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were performed on BNC-cement samples subjected to supercritical CO2 conditions to characterize its behavior. A finite-element-based numerical analysis of the chemo-hydro-mechanical (CHM) coupled behavior of the cement\u2013rock interface accounting for the obtained experimental data is then carried out to explore realistic scenarios of CO2 injection in deep wells.\n\n\n2\nExperimental program\nCement samples modified with bacterial nanocellulose were cured at 90\u00a0\u00b0C, simulating temperature at reservoir level before being carbonated under wet supercritical CO2 conditions. Porosimetry and mechanical tests were performed on these samples to study the evolution of the microstructure and mechanical behavior.\n\n2.1\nMaterials\nThe cement used in this study was Class G Portland Cement. The cement composition obtained by X-ray fluorescence is \n\n\nC\n\n\n3\n\n\nS 52.8%, \n\n\nC\n\n\n3\n\n\nA 1.6%, \n\n\nC\n\n\n2\n\n\nS 21.1% and \n\n\nC\n\n\n4\n\n\nAF 15.5%.\n22\n\n\nBacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is a biopolymer derived from the aerobic fermentation of bacteria of the genus \nGluconacetobacter\n.\n32\n This biopolymer is a membrane with circa 98% of water and 2% of bacterial nanocellulose. Cerrutti et\u00a0al. \n20\n shows SEM images of the membrane. Micrometric fibers of nanometric thickness form the membrane. Deionized water and a polycarboxylate ADVA 175 LN High-Performance Water-Reducing Admixture were used in the mixture.\n\n\n2.2\nPreparation of cement samples\nBacterial nanocellulose additive was prepared by grinding the BNC membranes and using ultrasound to generate a homogeneous fluid.\n22\n Cement mixtures were made following the American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 10\u00a0A.\n33\n The samples in cylindrical molds were cured in a 90\u00a0\u00b0C batch, unmolded after 24\u00a0h, and kept underwater for 48\u00a0h. They were then dried at 85\u00a0\u00b0C for one week,\n28\n simulating a dry cure in the wellbore. A group of 16 samples, 8 non-modified cement (PC) and 8 with 0.05% of BNC (BNC05), were prepared and cored with a diamond wire saw into 76\u00a0mm long cylinders with a diameter of 38\u00a0mm each.\n\n\n2.3\nCarbonation\nThe accelerated carbonation under wet supercritical CO2 conditions was carried out in a vessel of 4020\u00a0cm3 of volume at 90\u00a0\u00b0C and 20 MPa for 30 days. The samples were placed on a container grid inside the cell. 500 ml of water were placed at the bottom of the vessel to maintain humidity. First, the vessel was pressurized with CO2 until 8 MPa. Then, the temperature of the vessel was raised to 90\u00a0\u00b0C and the pressure was regulated until 20 MPa. These conditions were maintained during the entire test. Once the test finished, the heating system was turned off, and the pressure was slowly released until atmospheric pressure. Fig.\u00a01 shows the equipment used. 4 Portland Cement (PC) samples and 4 modified cement samples with 0.05% BNC (BNC05) were carbonated for 30 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\nPorosimetry measurement and permeability estimation\nThe pore size distributions of the BNC-cement samples were characterized using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The AutoPore IV 9500 Micromeritics with a maximum pressure of 230 MPa was used to measure pore sizes between 5\u00a0nm and 300 \n\u03bc\nm. Samples of approximately 1\u00a0cm3 were taken from a representative zone of the non-carbonated cement samples. In the carbonated cement case, samples were taken from the core and the most degraded zone near the exposed surface. Before testing, samples were dried by the freeze-drying method.\nThe effect of curing the samples in the oven (Section\u00a02.2) for 1 week was measured. For this purpose, air-cured samples (PC-Reference) and oven-cured samples (PC-NC and BNC05-NC) were compared. NC means non-carbonated samples, while 30INT and 30EXT are 30 days carbonated samples located at the interior and exterior of the bulk sample, respectively. The tests performed are listed in Table\u00a01.\n\nBy assuming cylindrical interconnected pores, we can calculate the pore diameter corresponding to each mercury pressure step by: \n\n(3)\n\n\np\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n4\n\u03b3\ncos\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03b3\n=\n\n mercury surface tension \n=\n 0.485 N\/m, \n\n\u03b8\n=\n\n mercury contact angle \n=\n 130\n\u00b0\n\n\n34\n, p \n=\n mercury pressure, d \n=\n pore diameter.\nAn estimate of permeability can be made from the results obtained in the MIP test. This estimation is performed by considering the macro-scale flow with Darcy\u2019s law and the micro-scale flow with Poiseuille\u2019s law.\nEach pore of class i of diameter \n\n\nd\n\n\ni\n\n\n has an intrusion volume of mercury \n\n\nV\n\n\ni\n\n\n, so a length \n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\n can be determined for each pore class i: \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nV\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\nd\n\n\ni\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming laminar flow, the Poiseuille\u2019s flow in a cylindrical tube depends on the difference of pressures at the tube ends, the dimensions of the tube, and the viscosity of the fluid. So the flow for each tube of diameter \n\n\nd\n\n\ni\n\n\n is: \n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nPoiseuille\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u0394\nV\n\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nP\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n(\n\u03c0\n\n\nd\n\n\ni\n\n\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n128\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n\n\u0394\n\n\nP\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n is every mercury pressure step, and \n\u03b7\n is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\nOnce the total flow rate is obtained, Darcy\u2019s law can determine the permeability at the macro-scale. Let \n\n\nV\n\n\nt\n\n\n be the total apparent volume of the MIP sample (ratio of total pore volume to porosity). The average pore length \n\n\nL\n\n\ne\n\n\n is defined as: \n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hydraulic gradient \ni\n is given by: \n\n(7)\n\n\ni\n=\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nP\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u0394\n\n\nP\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n is the total pressure increase in meters of water column measured in the MIP.\nTherefore, the intrinsic permeability of the material (independent of fluid conditions) is: \n\n(8)\n\n\n\u03ba\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nPoiseuille\n\n\n\n\ni\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nf\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nn\n is the total number of pores of different diameters, \nS\n is the cross-section of a cubic specimen with sides of length \n\n\nL\n\n\ne\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nf\n\n\n is the density of the fluid, and \ng\n is the gravity.\nThe calculated permeability accounts for an isotropic flux in a cubic sample. Hence, it needs to be divided by three to compare with the directional permeability obtained experimentally. This indicates that the fluid flows equally in the three directions of space.\n35\n\n\nThe specimens analyzed to calculate permeability were carbonated and non-carbonated samples of both cement types (PC-NC, PC-30EXT, BNC05-NC, BNC05-30EXT).\n\n\n2.5\nX-ray diffraction (XRD)\nX-ray diffractograms were obtained in a Philips 3020 diffractometer using CuK \n\u03b1\n radiation with a Ni-filter (35 kV, 40\u00a0mA). Scanning was performed between 3\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 2\n\u03b8\n, with a step of 0.04\u00b0 and a count time of 2 s\/step. The openings of the divergence, reception, and dispersion slots were 1, 0.2, and 1\u00b0 respectively, and no monochromator was used. The identification of the mineral phases in the material was performed using the X\u2019Pert High Score program. The standard procedures described in the literature and described by Moore and Reynolds\n36\n were followed to identify and quantify the minerals. Quantification was based on the work of Biscaye.\n37\n\n\n\n\n2.6\nUltrasonic wave measurement\nThe equipment used was a portable Olympus EPOCH XT detector with P and S ultrasonic waves measurements. Two transducers were placed on the top and bottom surfaces with a thin layer of gel to ensure full contact between the specimen surfaces and the transducers. The time it takes for the P and S elastic wave signals to travel through the sample was measured and divided by the sample\u2019s length. The shear and bulk moduli are then calculated by: \n\n(9)\n\n\nG\n=\n\u03c1\n\n\n\nV\n\n\ns\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nK\n=\n\u03c1\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\ns\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile the Young\u2019s Modulus and Poisson coefficient are calculated by: \n\n(10)\n\n\nE\n=\n\n\n9\nKG\n\n\n3\nK\n+\nG\n\n\n\u00a0and\u00a0\n\u03bd\n=\n\n\n3\nK\n\u2212\n2\nG\n\n\n6\nK\n+\n2\nG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7\nMechanical testing\nThe uniaxial compression tests were performed on a 100 kN universal testing machine by imposing a velocity of 0.5\u00a0mm\/min. The carbonated and non-carbonated mixtures were tested. The average strength value was calculated from 3 tested cylindrical samples of 38\u00a0mm in diameter by 76\u00a0mm height. Maximum compression strength and Young\u2019s modulus were obtained for all samples.\n\n\n\n3\nChemo-mechanical analysis of carbonated samples\nThe experimental study has been complemented by analyzing the chemo-poro-mechanical coupled behavior of the cement with added 0.05% BNC and reacting with the CO2. The model simulates the carbonation front advance in cement subjected to scCO2 and the changes generated by the chemical reactions using the classic balance equations of continuum mechanics relative to mass, momentum, entropy, and energy.\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n It is assumed that the porous solid remains saturated by the fluid (i.e.,\u00a0scCO2 does not penetrate within the pores of the cement).\n40\n\n,\n\n41\n CO2 is present in the skeleton as a dissolved species within the fluid.\nWhen cement is carbonated, porosity undergoes several variations. Some are due to chemical reactions, denoted \n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nL\n\n\n for leaching of cement matrix and \n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nP\n\n\n for calcite precipitation. The other variations of porosity are due to the deformation of the porous medium, with \n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\nF\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\nC\n\n\n as the deformation of the porosity filled by fluid phase and by calcite phase, respectively. The porosities involved can be written as follows: \n\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nF\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nL\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nP\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(12)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\nC\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nP\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nF\n\n\n corresponds to the pore volume occupied by the in-pore fluid per unit of the initial volume of the porous medium, \n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n0\n\n\n corresponds to the initial pore space per unit of the initial porous medium volume, which is not occupied by the solid phase. The difference between these two porosities is denoted by \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\nC\n\n\n, which is the pore volume occupied by carbonate crystals.\n38\n\n,\n\n42\n\n\n\nThe constitutive equations of isotropic linear poroelastic material of an infinitesimal representative volume element of a porous medium (d\n\n\n\n\u03a9\n\n\n0\n\n\n) are derived from Gibbs\u2013Duhem equalities and Clausius\u2013Duhem inequality assuming isothermal conditions: \n\n\n(13)\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n\n\nK\n\u2212\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\u2212\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n2\nG\n\n\n\u025b\n\u2212\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nk\n=\nF\n,\nC\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\nk\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\np\n\n\nk\n,\n0\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n(14)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\nJ\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\nJ\n,\n0\n\n\n=\n\n\nb\n\n\nJ\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\u2212\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nk\n=\nF\n,\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\nk\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\np\n\n\nk\n,\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nJ\nK\n\n\n\n\n;\nJ\n=\nF\n,\nC\n\n\n\n\n where \n\u03c3\n and \n\u025b\n are the stress tensor and infinitesimal strain tensor, \n\n\u025b\n=\ntr\n\n(\n\u025b\n)\n\n\n is the volumetric strain, K and G are the bulk modulus and shear modulus in drained conditions, respectively. \n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\nJ\n\n\n is the deformation of the porous volume occupied by the phase J (F stands for fluid and C for carbonates).

It should be noted that CSH carbonation is assumed not to start until the portlandite is completely carbonated since the portlandite maintains a high pH level (pH > 12).\nSince the cement is a heterogeneous multiphase material, a homogenization technique was used.\n44\n A modification in the homogenization formulation has been introduced to account for the contribution of bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) characteristics to the overall characteristics of modified Portland class G cement. The model is implemented in the finite element code BIL 2.3.0.\n45\n\n\n\n\nChemical reactions (carbonation-dissolution) occurring in the system induce changes in the transport and mechanical properties of the system. The main parameters that influence the carbonation advance are the intrinsic permeability \n\u03ba\n and the diffusion coefficient \n\n\nd\n\n\neff\n\n\n. Advection behavior is subjected to the medium permeability and fluid flux, while Fick\u2019s Law rules diffusion. Both phenomena are in turn intimately linked to the initial cement porosity.\n46\n\n,\n\n47\n For this type of cement, it can be evaluated using: \n\n(18)\n\n\n\u03ba\n=\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n\n0\n.\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n0\n\n\n is a parameter to calibrate.\nThe variation of the porosity in a porous medium must be considered throughout the effective diffusion coefficient. The effective diffusion coefficient is \n\u03d5\nD, while D is the solute diffusion coefficient in the interstitial pore solution. Based on experimental data, Mainguy and Coussy\n48\n propose the following expression for the effective coefficient of diffusion: \n\n(19)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\neff\n\n\n=\n\n\nd\n\n\neff\n,\n0\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n(\n9\n.\n95\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\nF\n\n\n\u2212\n29\n.\n08\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeing \n\n\nd\n\n\neff\n,\n0\n\n\n a parameter to calibrate.\nThese equations are empirical and aimed at reasonably representing the transport phenomena occurring within the cement matrix. Parameters \n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n0\n\n\n and \n\n\nd\n\n\neff\n,\n0\n\n\n can be modified to obtain values of intrinsic permeability and diffusivity suitable for class G or H cement.\n\n\n4\nExperimental results and discussion\n\nFig.\u00a02 shows the longitudinal cut of samples after 30 days of carbonation. Brown color represents the most degraded part of cement due to carbonation, the color probably being due to iron hydroxide released from chemical reactions.\n6\n PC samples show a more intact core compared to BNC05.\nThe penetration depth had significant progress on the cement cured at 90\u00a0\u00b0C after 30 days of carbonation. These results are similar to observations obtained by other authors for curing and carbonation under similar conditions.\n28\n\n,\n\n49\n There are some uncertainties based on studies by previous authors, mainly from the curing conditions before carbonation. Indeed, water to cement ratio, curing temperature, pressure, and duration will change the carbonation results, so different curing conditions and equal carbonation procedures will yield different results. Some previous experiences have short curing times for the cement,\n28\n\n,\n\n49\n and show high CO2 penetration, while some other authors considered longer curing periods,\n50\n\n,\n\n51\n showing less penetration. Recent works have shown that cement with lower density allows a higher CO2 penetration.\n52\n Furthermore, a higher hydration degree is tied with density increase and porosity reduction\n53\n; maintaining a high temperature during a short curing period will allow deeper CO2 penetration into the cement samples and more advanced chemical reactions.\n\n\n\nIn this work, carbonation led to an increase in the density of PC and BNC05 samples. Before carbonation, a slight difference is noted between PC and BNC05 samples, with densities of 1.89 and 1.87 g\/cm3, respectively. Once the samples were carbonated, density increased until 2.13 and 2.11 g\/cm3 for PC and BNC05 (Table\u00a02). PC shows an average mass uptake of 13.2%, while BNC05 shows an average of 12.9%, meaning that fewer chemical reactions have taken place. The mass gain is similar to previous works under similar conditions\n49\n; however, the penetration depth is different. Our results are closer to the penetrations observed by Fabbri and co-workers,\n28\n even though our samples are not fully carbonated after 30 days. This is because our samples are larger; therefore, more chemical CO2-bonds are needed to carbonate more volume, and the diffusion of CO2 limits chemical reactions.\n\nThe oven-drying conditioning for one week at 85\u00a0\u00b0C has not significantly affected the MIP porosity or the pore size distribution from non-conditioned samples (Fig.\u00a03). MIP porosity performed on these samples increased for both cement types from 33.7% to 34.5%, before the carbonation test, and the characteristic peak is approximately 50\u00a0nm. Bacterial nanocellulose did not significantly modify the cement in terms of porosity or pore size distribution compared to PC cement cured at 90\u00a0\u00b0C. Likely, bacterial nanocellulose does not have the same effect in inhibiting the larger cracks produced by the high curing temperature.\nCalorimetry tests have shown that BNC initially acts as a cement retarder.\n54\n\n,\n\n55\n As the curing time in this work is short, the porosity of BNC-cement is similar to PC with some coarser pores at 0.2 \n\u03bc\nm. Nevertheless, for more extended curing periods (p.e. cement cured at 20\u00a0\u00b0C for 28 days), the cement structure is denser and more compact. In these conditions, bacterial nanocellulose is more likely to develop a fiber network inside the cement and increment hydration degree,\n56\n\n,\n\n57\n as it tends to release adsorbed water, which contributes to the hydration.\n18\n\n\nThe MIP results after the carbonation of PC are presented in Fig.\u00a04. Here we can observe that the porosity variation along the radial direction leads to smaller pores and smaller porosity values. At the same time, the characteristic peak is shifted to pores smaller than 10\u00a0nm. After carbonation, no significant change is observed due to the addition of BNC. Porosity decreased to 24.5% at the core and to 21.5% near the exposed surface. BNC05 shows similar results to PC (Fig.\u00a05), and its porosity decreased at the core to 23.2% and near the exposed surface to 21%. The slight mass uptake is due to the consumption of CO2 by the occurring chemical reactions and is reflected by these small porosity variations. Reduced porosities lead to less diffusion of CO2 into the cement core and therefore increase the time to reach full carbonation of the samples.\nThe permeability results in Table\u00a03 are consistent with the intrinsic permeability values of cement cured at a high temperature. This method simplifies the complexity of crosslinking between different cylinders of different pore diameters and considers a tortuosity of 1.\n58\n The lengths (Li) are very high for small diameter pores, so a higher deviation error is also induced.\nIn this analysis, cement with nanocellulose addition appears to have lower permeability than cement without additions. After carbonation, the permeability values of PC are reduced by one order of magnitude. In contrast, the permeability in cement with BNC addition is in the same order of magnitude as the initial value. Results on carbonated cement samples require experimental validation.\n\nFig.\u00a06 presents the XRD patterns of the samples before and after carbonation. The relative percentages of the crystalline phases are presented in Table\u00a04. The analyses show the contents of portlandite, katoite, brownmillerite, magnesite, aragonite, and calcite. Portlandite is one of the main cement hydration products with high crystallinity. In contrast, CSH is a low crystallinity amorphous material. Brownmillerite is a phase of clinker denominated as \n\n\nC\n\n\n4\n\n\nAF. Aragonite and calcite are calcium carbonates of a different crystalline system with orthorhombic and rhombohedral shapes, respectively. When the curing temperature is high, new crystalline phases such as katoite appear. Katoite is a calcium aluminate hydrate more stable at high temperatures than ettringite.\n\n\nXRD results on cement before supercritical carbonation (Table\u00a04) show approximately 60% hydrated material (portlandite and katoite), 25% carbonated material (calcite and magnesite), and 15% non-hydrated and non-carbonated material (browmillerite). It can be observed that 25% of crystalline material is already carbonated during the curing process before supercritical carbonation. The lack of crystals related to CSH is due to the insufficient intensity of reflection of this amorphous material.\n59\n It is possible that the short curing time has generated a low reflection tobermorite and that the small readings have been incorporated into the crystalline phase of the katoite or calcite.\nXRD results on cement after supercritical carbonation show no cement hydration materials (portlandite and katoite). Therefore, it signifies complete carbonation. Magnesite also seems to have been consumed, allowing the formation of more calcium carbonates. Approximately 93% are crystalline carbonate materials; the remaining 7% is \n\n\nC\n\n\n4\n\n\nAF from the clinker phase that did not chemically react.\nThe results of the PC and BNC05 samples before and after carbonation are similar to each other, suggesting that the BNC did not significantly affect the microcrystalline structure of the cement under these curing conditions.\n\nTable\u00a05 shows the mechanical properties measured by \n\n\nV\n\n\nS\n\n\n and \n\n\nV\n\n\nP\n\n\n. Overall, during the carbonation process, mechanical properties increase. UCS tests corroborate this result. The samples show an increment in compressive strength and their Young\u2019s modulus (Fig.\u00a07). PC strength initially was 31 MPa, and after the carbonation stage, it increased by 44%, while BNC05 started with 24 MPa of strength, which increased by 60% with carbonation. Both types of cement initially had Young\u2019s modulus of 20 GPa, unlike the 25 GPa in long-cured specimens,\n25\n but after carbonation, this modulus increased by 11% for PC and by 18% for BNC05.\nNanocellulose has been reported to improve the mechanical properties of cement composites for well-hydrated cement.\n19\n\n,\n\n60\n\n,\n\n61\n In the present work, BNC05 samples initially have less compressive strength than PC samples and comparable Young moduli. These observations distinguish from the results previously obtained with cement cured at room temperature over a long period.\n22\n Curing at a higher temperature is probably generating larger cracks in the cement, so the microstructural effect of BNC does not substantially improve the mechanical behavior. Alternatively, this effect appears later because of the retarder effect of BNC or the superplasticizer, which slow down the hydration rate of the modified cement, and thus the hydration degree at the end of the curing time.\nIt is well known that carbonation under atmospheric conditions tends to increase the mechanical properties of cement.\n62\n\n,\n\n63\n However, there is no agreement on cement strength variations after supercritical carbonation.\n49\n In supercritical conditions, some results show an increment in compressive strength,\n64\n\n,\n\n65\n while more recent researchers were able to see a decrease in mechanical performance.\n28\n\n,\n\n66\n\n,\n\n67\n This variation is due to different conditions of cement hydration prior to carbonation\n68\n and subsequent carbonation conditions.\n65\n Indeed, experiments using the same cement and water to cement ratio and same carbonation conditions show a drop in strength values.\n25\n After short curing conditions, cement will not be fully hydrated. Therefore, the mechanical performance increment after carbonation will most likely be due to the cement matrix development by hydration acceleration imposed by temperature in the carbonation cell. The tested material\u2019s mechanical properties will be a combination of the effects of cement hydration compounds and precipitated calcite produced during carbonation.\nOn the other hand, well-hydrated cement will only experience a drop in strength due to CSH degradation and porosity increase over time.\n25\n\n,\n\n51\n\n,\n\n67\n\n,\n\n69\n In this work, supercritical carbonation is positively affecting the mechanical performance of cement. These observations are intricately linked to the carbonation conditions. Indeed, if cement carbonation is imposed by a continuously renewed fluid, then the products of carbonation (mainly carbonates), will in turn dissolve and be flushed out, leading to a strong increase in porosity of the cement, and degraded mechanical properties. In the present experiment, CO2 penetrates the sample by dissolution and diffusion in the pore fluid, which is not renewed.\nSince CC has better mechanical performance than CH, CC precipitation should increase mechanical performance and Young\u2019s modulus of carbonated cement. This effect can occur here because of the continuous hydration of cement inside the reactor, which links the precipitated CC with the cement matrix. These two effects increase mechanical properties, as seen by Fabbri et\u00a0al. and Sauki et\u00a0al.,\n28\n\n,\n\n65\n but cement hydration plays the most significant role during the carbonation process. This can also be observed from \n\n\nV\n\n\nP\n\n\n and \n\n\nV\n\n\nS\n\n\n wave data, where mechanical parameters increased. However, Young\u2019s moduli differ from the ones measured by UCS tests. Young\u2019s moduli measured by elastic waves are 19.5 and 21.3 GPa for PC before and after carbonation, while for BNC05, measured values were 18 and 20.5 GPa. UCS tests gave values of 20 GPa for both types of cement samples before carbonation, while after carbonation, these values were 22.2 GPa and 23.6 GPa for PC and BNC05, respectively.\nAfter carbonation, Fig.\u00a07 shows that the increase in the relative strength and Young modulus of BNC05 is more significant than for PC. BNC samples enhanced the hydration kinetics due to: (1) the hydrophilic properties of the bacterial nanocellulose\n57\n; and (2) its ability to release water during hydration.\n18\n\n\n\n\n5\nNumerical analysis of carbonated samples\nIn this section, the numerical analysis of the carbonated BNC samples is presented. A 2D analysis is performed simulating the experimental carbonation of the cylindrical samples. Calibration on the model is made by taking the porosity values obtained experimentally to estimate the intrinsic parameters of this cement.\n70\n The initial volumetric proportions of the minerals in the cement are estimated from the literature. The calibrated model is extrapolated to simulate in 1D the cement carbonation in a wellbore system under downhole conditions.\n\n5.1\nInitial parameters and intrinsic properties of cement\nPorosity is very variable for cement and depends mainly on the water to cement ratio and on the type of curing in which the specimen is placed. Some authors estimate porosities greater than 30%,\n30\n\n,\n\n49\n\n,\n\n71\n\n,\n\n72\n while others approximate it from 20% to 30%.\n73\u201376\n Regardless of the kind of oil cement in question (G or H), it can be generalized that the porosities of oil cement are around 25% to 35%. The initial porosity of the samples in this work before carbonation is 34.5%, as indicated in Section\u00a04.\n\n\nThe volumetric content of cement minerals depends substantially on the cement type, water to cement ratio, hydration degree, and curing temperature. So, it is necessary to estimate these proportions for the simulation. In some articles, the amount of Portlandite CH varies between 15 to 25%,\n46\n\n,\n\n74\n with commonly accepted values being percentages of 18 to 20%.\n38\n In previous results, using the same cement and same water to cement ratio,\n22\n a percentage of 20% was obtained by thermogravimetric analysis on well-hydrated cement samples. Class G and H cement have very low initial aluminate contents following API requirements to be resistant to sulfate attacks (C3A \n\u2264\n 3% and C4AF + 2 C3A \n\u2264\n 24%). So the hydrated aluminate components have a low percentage, around 6 to 14%.\n38\n\n,\n\n73\n\n,\n\n77\n Finally, the essential cement phase in terms of compressive strength, CSH, can vary between 60 to 27% in volume fraction.\n38\n\n,\n\n77\n\n\nThe intrinsic permeability is independent of the conditions to which the material is initially subjected, at least directly. Since the cement is a heterogeneous material, there is no unique intrinsic permeability value for cement. Nelson et\u00a0al. \n78\n, in their experiments, report values of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221216 m2 to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221220 m2. This is supported by Ghabezloo et\u00a0al. \n74\n and Mainguy et\u00a0al. \n79\n, who obtain values in the order of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221219 m2 y 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221220 m2. Sercombe et\u00a0al. \n76\n show values of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221216 m2 after excessive heating on hardened cement paste, so it can be assumed that this order of magnitude refers to cracked cement.\nThe diffusivity of cement of class G and H has also been variable, as reported by different authors. Huet et\u00a0al. \n80\n perform a compilation of the different transport mechanisms of cement G subjected to an environment of scCO2 and quotes diffusivity values of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212 m2s\u22121 down to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214 m2s\u22121. Mainguy et\u00a0al. \n79\n give an example of diffusion in the order of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212 m2s\u22121, and Vallin et\u00a0al. \n38\n determine a value of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210 m2s\u22121 on the simulation. Furthermore, Shen\n81\n quotes the values of different aqueous species in the order of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129 m2s\u22121.\nTo obtain the diffusion and permeability parameters for this particular cement for later use in the simulation at reservoir level, a porosity value equal to the experimental value of 34.5% for the first simulation is considered. As the rest of the volumetric proportions are variable, values were adopted from literature considering a 0.05% content of BNC: CSH 40.5%, CH 18%, aluminates 6.942%, and BNC 0.058%. The remaining compounds are classified as inert components, including amorphous silica, which is a carbonation product. CO2 concentration is calculated considering: water volume, temperature, pressures, and mole fraction of CO2 from experiments. The calculations give values of 1200 mol\/m3.\n\n\n\n\nThe initial parameters for fluid and cement are listed in Table\u00a06, where \n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\nvis\n\n\n is the fluid viscosity, \n\n\nK\n\n\nF\n\n\n the fluid compressibility, \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nF\n\n\n is the fluid density, \n\n\nR\n\n\nc\n\n\n is cement compressive strength, and \n\n\nR\n\n\nt\n\n\n the tensile strength. Table\u00a07 shows the molar volumes of the compounds involved.\nThe 2D model for the experimental carbonation consists of one-quarter of a sample (19\u00a0mm-radius by 38\u00a0mm-height) using a mesh of 22\u00a0\u00d7\u00a011 elements (Fig.\u00a08). The lower horizontal contour has restricted movements in the X direction, while the left vertical contour has restricted movements in the Y direction. The top and right-hand contours are subjected to the carbonation conditions. Table\u00a08 shows the initial conditions for modeling.\n\nThe well-system modeled consists of a CO2 reservoir drilled and refilled with a steel casing protected by a cement annulus. We used the same transport values after determining the advection and diffusion parameters from the previous simulation. The model for the wellbore simulation assumes 1D axial symmetry under plane strain conditions in the axial direction. The mesh of \n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n of an inch (19\u00a0mm) represents the annular cement thickness and allows studying the carbonation progress from the outer surface towards the inner cement. It consists of 502 elements that have the properties of the modified cement with BNC. Previous conditions for temperature and fluid pressure are considered (that is 90\u00a0\u00b0C and 20 MPa) with a 1.2 CO2 molarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2\nResults and discussion\nFirst, a sensitivity analysis of parameters to calibrate the numerical model is made to reproduce the experimental penetration results. Tables\u00a09 and 10 show the values of the intrinsic permeability and diffusion coefficient varying \n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n0\n\n\n and \n\n\nd\n\n\ne\nf\nf\n,\n0\n\n\n. As it can be observed, the values of permeability and diffusivity are in the range of the admissible values for cement class G previously mentioned.\nBy calibrating the model for \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n350\n\n and \n\n\n\nd\n\n\ne\nf\nf\n,\n0\n\n\n=\n160\n\n, a representation of the entire sample consistent with the MIP experimental results of porosity can be observed in Fig.\u00a09. Results clearly show how the carbonation advanced into the core. The 1D image shows the porosity variation as a function of the radius. The material near the exposed surface is completely carbonated, and the porosity reaches 21%, while at the core, the porosity average is similar to the 23.2% from the MIP experiments.\n\nFig.\u00a010 shows in more detail the dissolution and carbonation fronts. The blue line corresponds to the starting point of the chemical reaction of CH. In contrast, the red line is the limit between the carbonation process and the full carbonated zone. Some authors consider that the carbonation front or penetration depth follows a linear trend as a function of the square root of time (consistently because the chemical reactions are limited by the diffusion of CO2 within the fluid phase).\n82\n\n,\n\n83\n Nevertheless, this is usually based on the phenolphthalein test, which only considers the pH below 9. With the present model, we can distinguish the two fronts. In a first contact between the cement and scCO2, there is a significant decrease in CH and CSH content that lasts for the first few days. After 10 days, the dissolution front reaches the center of the cement sample. The complete reaction of CH and CSH front advances almost linearly in time but, it does not reach the cement center. Calcite is mostly deposited in the material near the exposed surface, decreasing its porosity, while it has not yet wholly precipitated in the core.\nEven though the dissolution front has reached the center, the chemical reactions between CO2 and CH\/CSH, which produce CC and water, are still taking place in a region located 1\u00a0cm away from the center. This means that all CH and CSH leaching is not complete after 30 days in these conditions.\n\n\nThe calibrated parameters are extrapolated to the cement submitted under downhole conditions in the context of CO2 geological storage. We have to keep in mind that curing and carbonation conditions are unfavorable to cement in the experimental results. However, the numerical model can be adapted to any condition considered. From this approach, additional characteristics of the carbonation front variability using these transport parameters can be obtained: permeability (Fig.\u00a011) and volumetric proportions (Fig.\u00a012) variations throughout the sample. Carbonation advance forms calcite from CH and CSH, which grows inside the pores. This produces a reduction of the porosity and, consequently, a decrease in permeability and diffusivity, which slow down the entry of more CO2 to the cement core. In Fig.\u00a011, this can be seen as a clogging effect. After 5 days of carbonation, we can observe a considerable CO2 penetration, but after 5 more days, the penetration rate has significantly slowed down. The calcite penetration in Fig.\u00a012 starts with the CH area dissolution and continues with the CSH decalcification when there is no longer CH to consume. CSH decalcification continues creating CC and amorphous silica, which becomes part of the inert components.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThe microstructure and mechanical changes of cement with bacterial nanocellulose additions and cured at 90\u00a0\u00b0C in the context of reservoir conditions were analyzed. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultrasonic wave measurements, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were performed on BNC-cement samples subjected to supercritical CO2 conditions to determine its behavior. In addition, a finite-element based numerical analysis of the cement\u2013rock interface was presented.\nBNC samples show a lower mass gain compared to PC, suggesting that fewer chemical reactions occurred. Nevertheless, the BNC-cement longitudinal sections present some small voids in their interior, which could allow further CO2 penetration.\nThe MIP results show that initially, the BNC samples have the same porosity as the cement without BNC addition. After carbonation, lower porosity is observed in cement with BNC, either in the core or near the exposed surface. From the MIP curves, a permeability analysis was performed. In this analysis, the samples with BNC show lower intrinsic permeability values than the cement without BNC.\nThe XRD results of the PC and BNC05 samples before and after carbonation show no difference from each other. After carbonation, the dominant crystalline phases are calcite and aragonite, which indicates the complete carbonation of the material near the surface exposed to the gas.\nUnmodified samples show a better mechanical performance during carbonation. However, carbonation in samples with BNC indicates a higher increase in relative strength than in samples without additions due to the BNC effect of releasing water during hydration inside the carbonation cell.\nA chemo-poro-mechanical model of scCO2 attack on a cement annulus of an abandoned oil well in the context of CO2 storage was presented. A modification on the formulation was implemented to add the nanocellulose characteristics. The experimental data and simulation results were back analyzed to determine the properties of the cement used. Once these properties were known, a simulation under downhole conditions in the context of CO2 geological storage was represented.\nResults show a decrease in permeability and hydration products over time and the advance of the dissolution and carbonation fronts. The numerical study shows the advantage of using this type of tool to study possible real scenarios of CO2 injection processes in deep wells. It can be adapted to different systems under different established conditions.\n\nNomenclature\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n:\n\n\nMercury surface tension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\nPore volume occupied by carbonate crystals\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nP\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\nMercury pressure step\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nP\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\nTotal pressure increment in meters of water column measured in the MIP\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n:\n\n\n\nInfinitesimal strain tensor\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n:\n\n\n\nVolumetric strain.

Unlike traditional shallow geothermal or ground source heat pump (GSHP) applications (such as purpose-built vertical boreholes or horizontal trenches\n1\u20133\n) energy geo-structures utilise underground structures primarily designed for stability (mainly foundations) to incorporate energy provision as an additional\/secondary function.\n4\u20138\n The implementation of the technology in foundation structures that are already planned to be constructed can significantly reduce capital costs and open new opportunities to further utilise this technology and increase the renewable portion of the world\u2019s energy supply.\nStructures that have been utilised as energy geo-structures so far consist of piles, retaining walls and tunnels, with piles having attracted most of the attention by the scientific community, likely due to their geometrical similarities to the well-studied traditional vertical boreholes. There have been a number of studies on energy piles with overall positive and encouraging results for the industry of shallow geothermal energy.\n9\u201314\n Similarly positive results have been shown by some studies on energy tunnels\n15\u201318\n and energy retaining walls, mainly diaphragm walls.\n19\u201323\n Less attention, however, has been given to other possible geo-structures, particularly soldier pile retaining walls, which this work investigates.\nEnergy retaining wall design can be more challenging to design compared to the more thoroughly investigated energy piles. A main difference between them is the fact that a retaining wall is only surrounded by ground on one of its sides, where the other one (or part of it) can form the underground space of a building. This not only results in less thermal storage being available but, perhaps more importantly, means that heat transfer must be controlled to avoid impacting on the thermal comfort of the underground building (i.e.,\u00a0the inner built environment), for example, by the use of thermal insulation.\n24\n While a recent study focuses on the impact of the wall boundary conditions on effective heat transfer yields and the potential repercussions of ill-defined boundary conditions,\n24\n the impact on the thermal performance of the key design physical parameters, such as the pipe length, the soldier pile spacing and the pile depth has not been studied for this type of retaining walls. Energy retaining wall design needs to carefully consider all these aspects to ensure that the system can provide as much thermal energy as possible, without impacting on the otherwise construction and operation of the building.\nThe design of energy geo-structures has mostly focused around two areas: geo-mechanical and thermal design. The first area mainly investigates the mechanical\/structural impact that incorporating the geothermal piping and operating the system can have on the underground structures.\n25\u201332\n These investigations consider characteristic stresses, strains etc. and are essential to ensure there will not be any undesirable effects, such as settlement. The second area investigates the thermal performance of these structures, considering the heat transfer in the various media and answering the key question of how much energy can be provided by the system.\n33\u201335\n The presented work is part of this second category, investigating the thermal design of energy soldier pile walls and considering the effect of important design parameters, such as the pipe configuration, wall depth and pile spacing on the thermal performance of the system.\n\n\n2\nFinite element modelling and parametric analysis\n\n2.1\nModel geometry, governing equations and parametric configuration\nThis work investigates the thermal design of soldier pile retaining walls, adopting a typical geometry for the foundations of a high-rise building in Melbourne Australia. The investigation is undertaken using a finite element numerical modelling approach developed within the University of Melbourne implemented in the software package COMSOL Multiphysics. The approach has been thoroughly validated using traditional borehole GHEs as well as energy geo-structures including piles, walls and tunnels.\n24\n\n,\n\n36\u201338\n The governing equations of heat transfer (energy balance) and fluid flow (momentum and continuity) are coupled to capture the interacting physics. Heat transfer is modelled primarily by conduction, occurring mainly in the ground, concrete elements, HDPE pipe walls as well as partially in the carrier fluid, and by convection, occurring mainly in the carrier fluid. Given the location of the adopted geometry, the effect of groundwater flow is not considered in this study (even though the model can account for it if required). Additional details on the governing equations and model can be found in Refs.\u00a036, 37, a summary is included next.\nTo model the water flow inside the HDPE pipes, the continuity and momentum equations for an incompressible fluid are used as follows\n39\n: \n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u2207\n.\n\n(\nA\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nw\n\n\n)\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nv\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\u2207\n\n\np\n\n\nw\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nf\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nd\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nv\n\n\nw\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where A is the inner cross-section of the HDPE pipe, \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nw\n\n\n is the density of water, \n\n\nv\n\n\nw\n\n\n represents the water velocity field in the pipes embedded within the pile GHEs, t is the time, \n\n\np\n\n\nw\n\n\n is the water pressure, \n\n\nf\n\n\nD\n\n\n represents the Darcy friction factor, and \n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\u0332\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\u0332\n\n\n\n is the hydraulic diameter of the pipe.

As it can be seen symmetry is used throughout to reduce the size of the model. The symmetry condition applied on the xz plane accounts for the retaining wall on the opposite side of the basement (y \n=\n\n\n\u2212\n10 m), while on the yz planes for the neighbouring soldier piles along the wall. The latter is a slightly conservative approach as it assumes an infinitely long wall (with thermally activated soldier piles connected in parallel in a given circuit) and therefore the potential thermal interference between the soldier piles can be marginally higher than compared to a finite number of soldier piles (i.e.,\u00a0lower thermal interference for the piles at each end of the wall). Insulation has been applied at the surface boundary (assuming densely built area as well as conservative since surface air variations can be beneficial for the performance of the system under similar operating and ground temperature conditions\n40\n), at the bottom layer (a constant temperature boundary can also be used and produces identical results given the large distance to the slab), as well as the wall and slab surfaces of the inner underground building to prevent heat leaking into\/out of the building. Lastly, a farfield temperature boundary has been applied, equal to the mean annual ground temperature for the area which is 19.5\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\nFig.\u00a02 shows the dimensions and geometry of the underground structures (thermally activated soldier pile wall and non-activated slabs) for the adopted scenario in both top and side views. In order to broaden the scope of this research and provide a more holistic view of their thermal performance, three important parameters, the soldier pile depth (\n\n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n, the soldier pile spacing (\n\n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n and the pipe configuration\u00a0\u2013\u00a0number of loops (\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n, are varied throughout the analyses, as shown in Table\u00a01. In addition to these, when varying \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n two different spacing scenarios are considered as explained in detail in Section\u00a02.4. The pipe circuits are implemented into the 750\u00a0mm diameter soldier piles (375\u00a0mm radius) by connecting U-loops in series, as in Fig.\u00a03, closer to the ground side where possible and spaced equally at a cover of about 150\u00a0mm. Each U-loop connects two pipe legs at the bottom of the pile (lower bend) and the U-loops are connected at the top of the pile (upper bend) forming one pipe circuit. The material properties values used, based on typical conditions for Melbourne, can be seen in Table\u00a02. The fluid flow rate for the carrier fluid has been set to \n\n5\n.\n5\n\nL\/min\n\n, which is slower than for typical borehole ground heat exchangers, but still in turbulent regime, to increase the fluid residence time in the relatively short structures. This gives enough time to enable efficient heat transfer between the wall and ground as well as a large enough temperature difference between the inlet and outlet (\n\u0394\nT) to run the GSHP. It is worth noting that while this study adopts a U-loop pipe configuration, other pipe configurations could also be adopted, as have been studied elsewhere including investigations on the influence of design parameters not studied herein such as the shank spacing and pipe diameter.\n41\u201344\n Finally, it should also be mentioned that within this study the depth of embedment has been kept constant for ease of comparison. The embedment of soldier piles is typically small, in the order of no more than one or two metres, providing relatively small contribution to overall thermal performance. A detailed but smaller scale investigation varying this depth and arriving at similar conclusions can be found in\u00a0Ref.\u00a037.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nThermal loading\nThe thermal load utilised in this work is based on typical monthly heating and cooling requirements for a high rise building in Melbourne, Australia (the geothermal systems providing part of the overall building demand as part of a more complicated hybrid system\n46\n\n,\n\n47\n) and is shown in Fig.\u00a04. Two such distributions are considered, labelled unbalanced and balanced. The unbalanced distribution represents the more typical commercial thermal needs, which are mainly in cooling. Understanding that these are unfavourable operating conditions for a GSHP, a balanced load distribution is also introduced, where equal amount of heating (to match the cooling demand of the building) is provided mostly over the winter months. This heating is provided by introducing other parties or spaces that can have heating demand, such as residential spaces in a multi-storey building, or nearby hospitals or sports centres with swimming pools. The balanced thermal load distribution is expected to perform significantly better than the unbalanced, especially considering long term effects, however, it can also be more complicated to configure and arrange if third parties are involved.\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\nVarying \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n: Spacing scenarios\nThe soldier pile spacing, \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n, can be an important parameter influencing the thermal performance of energy soldier pile walls. Firstly, it indicates the volume of soil (and therefore thermal storage) that each soldier pile GHE can be engaging. Moreover, it can determine the degree at which each soldier pile GHE might thermally interfere with its surrounding GHEs during operation. In this work, two different scenarios are investigated when varying \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n, considering both theoretical and practical approaches for real-world conditions. Spacing scenario 1 involves simply changing the spacing of the soldier piles without changing the total number of piles activated or how much energy each GHE provides. This scenario represents cases where not all the structural piles need to be thermally activated (incorporating HDPE pipes in) to provide the desired heating and cooling energy, as well as provides a more theoretical understanding on how \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n affects the system\u2019s thermal performance. However, it needs to be noted that the pile spacing is in most cases based on the structural design team and therefore it is very unlikely that the geothermal design can influence it directly. On the other hand, spacing scenario 2, considers the case where, similarly, not all piles are thermally activated, but in order to satisfy the total thermal energy needs, one must exchange more heat with the ground per pile. In other words, in this second scenario, thermally activating less piles (such as every second\/third\/fourth soldier pile, instead of every single one) does increase their effective GHE pile \u2018thermal\u2019 spacing but also increases the thermal load per GHE and therefore more thermal energy is demanded by each pile GHE. This scenario may represent a more realistic case given the typically lower thermal yield of energy walls than that of energy piles, and a geothermal design decision is less constrained by the structural aspects. Even though increasing the thermal load per GHE can decrease their thermal performance, activating less overall piles could decrease (or eliminate) the thermal interference between the GHEs (which can be significant due to the typical short pile spacing), as well as result in less associated costs for materials and installation. Fig.\u00a05 depicts schematically the difference between the two spacings scenarios for an example retaining wall segment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\nAdopted evaluation metrics\nThis work utilises numerical modelling to analyse the long-term thermal performance of energy soldier piles under a number of different conditions. Each such simulation considers 25\u00a0years of operation of the GSHP system. From the outputs of the numerical simulation of great interest are the temperatures of the carrier fluid, which can determine if the design is acceptable (i.e.\u00a0if the considered thermal energy can be feasibly provided by the system) by inspecting the range of these temperatures over the 25-year period. Importantly, the temperatures of the carrier fluid (connecting to the GSHP) need to be within the operating range of the ground-source heat pump. Moreover, extremes should be avoided to prevent potential issues, such as freezing of the ground. This temperature range is typically about 0\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0to\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C, with more recent heat pumps being able to push these boundaries further (at the expense of efficiency). In reality the case specific application of the energy geo-structures can also affect this range and in certain conditions the temperature limits need to be stricter than others (to avoid for example heat leaking in the building\n24\n).\nIn this study, the representative carrier fluid temperature adopted is the average of the temperature at the inlet and outlet of the pipe circuit for each pile (\n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\nv\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n+\n\n\nT\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nE\nW\nT\n+\nL\nW\nT\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n). Moreover, to evaluate each scenario\/simulation, the maximum (and sometimes minimum) of the average fluid temperature over the 25-year (9125 days) simulation is taken as a representative value of how well the system performed. These metrics are indicated in Eqs.\u00a0(7), noting that \nt\n represents time in terms of days. Given the adopted thermal loads, \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n is only relevant for the balanced load as in the cooling dominant unbalanced load the temperature keeps increasing and \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n is the critical metric. In addition, several studies within this work use a relative value to show the increase\/decrease in \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n for different configurations with respect to a reference value, \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\u2212\nr\ne\nf\ne\nr\ne\nn\nc\ne\n\n\n, which is the \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n for a particular case within each analysis and is based on the values of that analysis. The resulting relative value labelled \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\u2212\nr\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n\n\n, is shown in\u00a0Eq.\u00a0(8) in its general form, noting that in each specific study the details of this metric are provided. \n\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\nmax\n\n\nt\n=\n0\n\u2026\n9125\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\nv\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\nmin\n\n\nt\n=\n0\n\u2026\n9125\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\nv\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\u2212\nr\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\u2212\nr\ne\nf\ne\nr\ne\nn\nc\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\nThis section presents the results and discussion stemming from the analyses detailed in Section\u00a02. In Section\u00a03.1 typical results from the detailed FEM simulations are introduced. The influence of the pipe length and number of U-loops installed per soldier pile GHE is presented next in Section\u00a03.2 in terms of both a specific investigation on the impact of the pipe length variation on the thermal response of the wall (where other parameters are fixed) as well as a more complete overall analysis that takes into account all possible parametric variations in terms of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n,\n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n,\n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n\n, spacing scenarios and thermal load. Lastly, Section\u00a03.3 presents equivalent investigations on the geometric parameters \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n and \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n. These are presented together because of their similarities, as explained below, and for this purpose an additional analysis looking closer at their interacting effects is also presented. To cover all the different parameter combinations and understand the inter-connected dynamics and effects of these parameters, 480 simulations are utilised, each considering 25\u00a0years of operation of the system.\n\n3.1\nTypical results\nAs explained in Section\u00a02.4 the values of \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n are used throughout the presented analyses as a metric of thermal performance. Fig.\u00a06(a) shows these values in the average fluid temperature response distribution over time for a 28 m long 750\u00a0mm diameter soldier pile (including 2\u00a0m of embedment) with three U-loops and a pile spacing of 3.6\u00a0m for both the unbalanced and balance thermal loads introduced earlier in Fig.\u00a04. Fig.\u00a06(b) shows a detail of the fluid temperature variation along the pipe length at 24.33\u00a0years (when \n\n\nT\n\n\nmax\n\n\n occurs) for the unbalanced load case. The geothermal designer decides the long-term maximum and minimum temperatures, \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n, which need to be between the operating range of the GSHP (typically 0\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C), and in general, the narrower the range and closeness to the ground undisturbed temperature \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\na\nr\nf\ni\ne\nl\nd\n\n\n, the higher the efficiency of the GSHP system. Therefore, \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n are key resulting values to check for an effective design.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nImpact of pipe length\nThe pipe length in each energy soldier pile is a parameter that is independent from the constraints of the structural design and therefore solely determined by the geothermal design of the structures. It is generally expected that the longer the amount of pipe that is placed within energy geo-structures the more amount of thermal energy can be extracted from\/injected to the ground. On the other hand, the more pipe used the higher the design complexity and associated capital costs for materials and installation. Therefore, determining a suitable amount of pipe per GHE can be an important part of geothermal design. Fig.\u00a07 shows how the pipe length (in terms of the number of U-loops connected in series per soldier pile GHE) can affect these resulting maximum and minimum fluid temperatures, for a 28 m long soldier pile (750\u00a0mm diameter) and a pile spacing of 3.6 m, and for material properties as in Table\u00a02. The results show a relatively significant performance improvement when utilising up to about 3 U-loops, decreasing \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n over 2\u00a0\u00b0C in the unbalanced case and around 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C in the balanced case and increasing \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n by over 3\u00a0\u00b0C. Increasing the length of pipe over 3 U-loops results in relatively insignificant improvements, suggesting that in this case that amount of pipe is unnecessary.\n\nTo gain a broader understanding of the influence of the pipe length linked to the number of loops \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n, Fig.\u00a08 shows the normalised results for all combinations of the varied parameters (\n\n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n,\n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n\n, Thermal Load, Spacing Scenarios). The results are normalised based on the value of \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n when 6 U-loops are used and confirm that while some variation exists, using more than about 3 U-loops in all cases is likely unnecessary. The value of \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n when using 3 U-loops for the vast majority of cases (94% for spacing scenario 1 and 90% for spacing scenario 2) was no more than 4% higher than when using 6 U-loops (with a few extreme cases included for completeness -e.g.\u00a0very short soldier piles with very high load per pile\u00a0\u2013\u00a0resulting in slightly higher values of up to 8%). It was observed that both the values of \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\np\ne\n\n\n and \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n do affect the curvature of the fitted lines, however, at a relatively minor degree, suggesting that in most realistic cases 3 U-loops would be a good design solution for energy soldier piles. It is worth noting here that this study did not alter the diameter of the soldier piles, the diameter of the pipe, the flow rate or the effective thermal conductivity of the concrete and ground which could also be influential parameters to how effective is incorporating more or less amount of pipe. Lower values of thermal conductivity, for example, could potentially justify longer pipe circuits. The type of the thermal load distribution does not seem to affect the optimal value for \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n, a fact that was also confirmed by using several other types of distributions (constant cooling, constant heating, daily varying, shaved) for this case study and observing very similar results (not included here to avoid an excessive paper length).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nGeometrical parameters: soldier pile spacing and depth\nThe soldier pile spacing and depth are two parameters that can have a similar effect on the thermal performance of the energy geo-structures, since they both define how much soil volume\/thermal storage each soldier pile GHE can utilise. The deeper and more widely spaced the soldier piles are the more thermal storage they can reach. This section investigates these two parameters, starting with a specific example for each of the two, then exploring how they affect each other and their interacting thermodynamics and finally looking at the complete parametric analysis that incorporates all possible combinations of parameters that are varied within this study.\n\n3.3.1\nInvestigating \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n and \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n for a specific example\nIn the first analysis \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n is varied while the other parameters are fixed as \n\n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n3\n.\n6\n\nm\n\n and \n\n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n=\n3\n\n. Fig.\u00a09 shows the \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n (where applicable) for the unbalanced and balanced thermal load distributions. The results suggest a significant effect on the thermal performance showing a decrease in \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n (and thus less extreme temperatures) of up to about 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C per metre depth for the unbalanced thermal load and up to about 0.7\u00a0\u00b0C per metre depth for the balanced load as well as increases in \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n of up to about 1.2\u00a0\u00b0C per metre depth. The effect is more dominant for shallower depths (i.e.\u00a0increasing a soldier pile wall from 10 m to 20 m is more impactful than increasing it from 20 m to 30 m) and thus the curves in Fig.\u00a09 have steeper gradients for lower values of \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n. However, even for the deeper depths of over 30 m, the improvement can still be significant, since the fitted lines are indicating a continuous decline beyond the 36 m adopted by this study.\n\nUnlike \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n, the soldier pile spacing, \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n can influence their thermal performance not only by offering more soil volume (as thermal storage) per pile GHE but also by determining how\/if the activated soldier piles thermally interfere with each other. The closer the activated soldier piles are placed the more likely that thermal interference will occur between them affecting their performance. Fig.\u00a010 shows how \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n affects the thermal performance for the specific set of the other parameters, for both types of spacing scenarios as explained in Section\u00a02.3. In spacing scenario 1, where only the spacing of the piles is increased (Fig.\u00a010(a)), it can be seen that there is a significant performance improvement (lower \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n, higher \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n) when increasing \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n from 1.8 m to 3.6 m, after which the effect is lessened. This is likely because beyond this distance, each pile GHE only minimally interferences with its neighbouring GHEs. In spacing scenario 2, on the other hand, where both the spacing and the number of piles\/thermal load are varied (Fig.\u00a010(b)), a decrease in the thermal performance can be seen when increasing the spacing. This suggests that the performance decrease due to the additional thermal load applied on each pile GHE is more significant than the benefits of increasing their spacing, resulting in an overall negative effect. Having said that, however, it is worth acknowledging that even if the maximum and minimum fluid temperatures become more extreme, this practice can still be worth pursuing, assuming these temperatures are still within the acceptable range, because of the significant savings in capital costs for having to activate less amount of soldier piles (materials, installation logistics, testing etc.). For example, for the data shown in Fig.\u00a010(b), activating every second pile (\n\n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n3\n.\n6\n\nm\n\n)\n\n\n might be a good solution since the temperature limits are acceptable but only half the number of soldier piles need to be thermally activated. Moreover, an additional benefit is the fact that by increasing the thermal load per soldier pile GHE, the temperature difference between circuit inlet and outlet (\n\n\u0394\nT\n=\n\n|\n\n\nT\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n|\n\n=\n\n|\nE\nW\nT\n\u2212\nL\nW\nT\n|\n\n\n) is also increased, which can be beneficial to the operation of the heat pump.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2\nInteracting effects of soldier pile spacing and soldier pile depth\nHaving identified how \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n and \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n can affect the carrier fluid temperatures independently, we now explore their mutual effects and how the two parameters can affect each other\u2019s influence on the GSHP system performance. Fig.\u00a011 provides an understanding of this, by showing how \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n varies with \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n for different values of \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n and vice-versa. Looking at spacing scenario 1 first (red lines), increasing either \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n or \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n reduces the impact of the other parameter (flattening the line). The effect has diminishing returns, for example the red lines in plot (a) becoming closer together the more \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n increases. This is likely because of the similar objectives behind increasing \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n and \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n, as discussed, where increasing the soil volume\/thermal storage beyond a certain value results in diminishing returns. Looking at spacing scenario 2 (blue lines), the results show a dissimilar effect between the two parameters. While plot (b) shows that varying \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n is again more impactful for shallower soldier piles, when looking at plot (a), increasing \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n in this case also makes varying \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n more impactful. This is because of the additional thermal load per GHE in spacing scenario 2, showing that the thermal load per GHE is a crucial parameter in GSHP design and can affect the significance of the structure geometry on the thermal performance. Looking at plot (b), the results suggest, for example, that for deeper piles activating less piles with higher thermal load and spacing (increasing \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n for blue lines) might be a good design solution with only slightly increase \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n and with minimised capital costs, while for shallower piles the increase in \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n becomes to excessive for the design to be acceptable, as it increases at a much higher rate. Another interesting observation relates to plot (b) and how the top red line (\n\n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n10\n\n m) intersects with the blue lines. The three intersecting points essentially mean that for \n\n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n3\n.\n6\n\nm\n\n the performance of a 10 m pile is the same as a 24 m pile providing twice as much thermal load, while for \n\n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n5\n.\n4\n\n m, the performance of a 10 m pile is the same as a 36 m pile providing thrice as much thermal load. This suggests that increasing the depth of a soldier pile GHE increases the thermal energy that can be provided at an approximate rate of \n\n1\n.\n2\n:\n1\n\n (increasing the depth by 120% provides 100% more thermal load).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3\nComplete parametric analysis\nIn this section a large-scope parametric analysis is presented, which takes into consideration all possible variations and combinations of parameters outlined in Sections\u00a02.2\u20132.4 (i.e.\u00a0all different values of \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n, \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n, thermal loads and spacing scenarios). The results are presented in a normalised way (specified on the plots), such that the incremental difference is shown when varying the different parameters. Fig.\u00a012 presents the results of this analysis with respect to \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n. The y axis shows the value for \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\u2212\nr\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n\n\n which, for each set of parameters, is the relative value of \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n at each point along the \nx\n-axis compared to the respective \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n for the deepest value in the analysis (\n\n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n36\n\nm\n\n used as a benchmark). Therefore, a value of 1.2, for example, shows a 20% increase in \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n when decreasing the depth from 36 m. The results show that for all configurations a deeper pile results in lower \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n (and therefore better performance). The range of improvement can vary significantly, with shallower piles being most affected (comparing a 10 m pile with a 36 m pile shows an increase in \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n between about 20% and over 100% for extreme cases). Moreover, it is also worth noting that the balanced thermal load in general shows a less extreme response, indicating that the thermal load distribution can affect how much improvement increasing the pile depth can have on the thermal performance. This is further reinforced by the fact that in spacing scenario 2 (where the magnitude of the thermal load is increased) more extreme differences are observed when varying \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n. In both scenarios the value of \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n can affect the gradients of the fitted lines (in reversed ways per Section\u00a03.3.2) as can \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n but at a lesser degree. Finally, it should also be mentioned that within this study the depth of embedment has been kept constant for ease of comparison (and being a conservative approach). A detailed but smaller scale investigation varying this depth and arriving at similar conclusions can be found in\u00a0Ref.\u00a037.\n\n\nFig.\u00a013 presents a similar analysis, with respect to a varying \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n instead of \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n. The results follow the patterns identified in Sections\u00a03.3.1 and 3.3.2, regarding the two different spacing scenarios, one showing a decreasing trend in \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n with increasing \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n and the second an increasing one due to the additional thermal load per pile GHE. A very notable trend is the effect of the unbalanced vs balanced thermal load, the first one involving annual thermal cumulative effects (overheating the ground over the years). In spacing scenario 1, where increasing \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n does not affect the thermal load, the two thermal load distributions result in very different results, with the unbalanced one causing the choice of \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n to be significantly more influential to the thermal performance of the GSHP system, likely due to the thermal interference between piles being magnified by the unbalanced load. This suggests that if the thermal load used is relatively balanced, the choice of \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n (coming from the structural design unless not activating all the piles) is less crucial to the performance of the system, making the GSHP system more likely to be a feasible solution. For both thermal load distributions \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n and \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n did impact the fitted curve as indicated (\n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n more than \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n), however at relatively insignificant degrees. Plot (b) shows distinctly different results for spacing scenario 2, with the type of the thermal load distributions having no distinctive influence on the results. In this case a more dominant factor on how varying \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n changes the performance is \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n, confirming the results of Section\u00a03.3.2 that in longer soldier piles activating every second or third soldier pile can be a more viable design solution compared to shallow ones. Furthermore, we note that when activating every 2nd pile (plot (b) \n\n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n3\n.\n6\n\nm\n\n) no case exceeded a value of 1.2, which for most cases could result to a cheaper but still feasible design (for example increasing \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n from 25\u00a0\u00b0C to less than 30\u00a0\u00b0C but activating only half the soldier piles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nSummary and conclusions\nEnergy soldier pile walls are a promising type of energy geo-structures, that can be utilised to provide thermal energy for heating and cooling, in addition to their structural stability. This study investigates the thermal performance of these structures in detail, utilising validated advanced numerical modelling approaches to run long term simulations of 25\u00a0years. Important geometrical parameters such as the soldier pile spacing, \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n, and depth, \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n, the pipe length, in terms of number of connected U-loops \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n, as well as the thermal load are taken into consideration to identify useful insights regarding their potential and design.\nThe amount of pipe incorporated per soldier pile GHE seems to show a considerable impact on the thermal performance up to a certain value. The presented analyses suggest that 3 U-loops would be a good design solution for most realistic cases as over 90% of all results showed a difference in \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n of less than 4% between incorporating 3 or 6 U-loops. This optimal value for \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n was relatively unaffected by the values of \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\np\ne\n\n\n, \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n and the thermal load distribution suggesting that it can be considered as a general rule of thumb.\nThe value of \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\np\ne\n\n\n, seems to be a significant factor on the thermal performance of the system, with deeper piles showing a better performance. The improvement is particularly impactful for shallow piles suggesting that under certain conditions extending relatively shallow soldier piles could be a reasonable design consideration. Preliminary results indicate that increasing the depth of these structures increases the thermal load that can be provided by a ratio of about 1:0.83. The impact of \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\np\ne\n\n\n seems to be particularly dependent on the thermal load magnitude and at a much lesser degree \n\n\nN\n\n\nl\no\no\np\ns\n\n\n while it is identified that \n\n\nL\n\n\np\ni\np\ne\n\n\n and \n\n\nS\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n can affect the impact of one another (i.e.\u00a0for shorter soldier piles the spacing might be more critical than for longer)\nThe spacing of the soldier piles can also be significant to the performance of the system. When the soldier piles are spaced further away (spacing scenario (1) a better thermal performance is achieved. The impact is particularly notable when the spacing is short enough (i.e.\u00a0about 2 m for balanced thermal loads) for thermal interference between the soldier piles to be in effect, while beyond a certain distance the improvement is minimal. The thermal load used is important to the spacing, as unbalanced loads tend to magnify the effects of thermal interference. When the spacing was increased by activating less soldier piles overall (spacing scenario (2) the thermal performance decreased, as the additional load per GHE outstripped the benefits of the wider spacing. Considering, however, how this approach can significantly reduce capital costs, the investigation showed that it can be a viable solution in certain cases, such as for relatively deeper soldier piles which allow more thermal storage.\nOverall, this work shows that energy soldier pile walls can be efficiently utilised as energy geo-structures and that careful consideration of the geometry and design parameters can aid in optimising their performance. Given that these structures are primarily designed for stability and the constraints this introduces, it is critical to understand how these parameters affect the thermal performance of the GHEs, how they affect each other\u2019s influence and how they can be used to better utilise and design energy walls\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nNikolas Makasis: Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft.

This study focused on a particular type of shallow geothermal application: energy geostructures (EGs)\n2\n. EG, which are also called thermo-active geostructures, are innovative civil engineering geostructures that couple the structural role with a heat exchanger role. The transition from regular geostructures to EGs is simple, it only requires heat exchangers (HEs) to be installed and secured to the reinforcing cage whenever a new geostructure is needed. Some of the main advantages of this technology are that energy is continuously available, regardless of weather conditions, it is available almost everywhere and it is usable in a wide range of applications\n3\u201310\n. Possible applications of EGs and shallow geothermal systems include: (i) heating and cooling of civil engineering structures (residential and commercial buildings, industries, etc.)\n11\u201314\n, (ii) production of hot water for agricultural needs\n15\u201317\n, (iii) de-icing of deck, bridge and road pavements\n18\n\n,\n\n19\n. EG technology has been developed over the past decades\n20\n and exhibits a good potential for energy production\n11\n, enabling the satisfaction of the heating and cooling needs of the built environment.\n\nIn this study, thermo-active walls, i.e.,\u00a0energy walls (EWs), are investigated. Typical examples of EW are single and multi-floored underground infrastructures (e.g., train stations, underground car parks, and basements of high-rise buildings) and shallow cut-and-cover tunnels\n21\u201327\n. Among the various types of EGs, EWs represent a relatively new technology; consequently, numerous challenges exist. First, the heat transfer modes and the interactions between the EWs and the surrounding materials are not fully understood. Second, there is a lack of methods and guidelines for the thermal and mechanical analysis and design of EWs.\nThis study focused on the definition of the thermal performance of EWs. The objective was to develop a methodology for early-stage thermal performance design based on analysis of the hydrothermal behavior of EWs implemented in a one-level underground infrastructure. Herein, the main characteristics of the hydrothermal behavior of EGs that must be considered in the thermal performance design are first outlined. Second, the features of a numerical model employed to investigate the hydrothermal behavior of EWs are presented. Then, the results of extensive numerical analyses (i.e.,\u00a0parametric analyses) are presented as charts that describe the thermal potential of installing EWs in different thermal environments and geometrical conditions. Finally, a design methodology with a sound theoretical basis that links the heat transfers, fluid dynamics, and seepage in porous media is developed and presented as a flowchart. This technique can easily be employed by designers to evaluate the thermal potential of EWs at a known site.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nHydrothermal phenomena related to thermo-active walls\nThermal activation of walls and, more generally, of geostructures involves multiphysical phenomena interacting at two different scales: the infrastructure scale (i.e.\u00a0lengths of \n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n to \n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nm\n\n), as reported and described by\u00a0Ref.\u00a028, and the HE scale. At the HE scale (i.e. lengths of 10\u22122 to \n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nm\n\n), a fluid flows in the pipes under non-isothermal conditions, and exchanges heat with the surroundings. Mutual, concurrent interactions between the two scales occur during thermal activation and affect the hydrothermal behavior. To thoroughly account for all such phenomena, three-dimensional (3D) hydrothermal finite element modeling is used in this study. To describe the thermal performance of EWs in different environmental and geometrical conditions, extensive numerical (parametric) analyses were performed, as described in the following sections.\n\n\n2.2\nFeatures of numerical analyses\nIn the analyses, a portion of an underground infrastructure was modeled using the finite element software Comsol Multiphysics\u00a9. The dimensions of the model along the x-, y-, and z-axes were as follows: \n\n8\n\n\nH\n\n\nw\na\nl\nl\n\n\n+\n\n\nL\n\n\nt\nu\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n\n\n, \n\n8\n\n\nH\n\n\nw\na\nl\nl\n\n\n\n, \n\n5\n\n\nH\n\n\nw\na\nl\nl\n\n\n\n, respectively (Fig.\u00a01) where \n\n\nH\n\n\nw\na\nl\nl\n\n\n represents the EW height and \n\n\nL\n\n\nt\nu\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n\n is the tunnel width. The soil and concrete were considered as isotropic and homogeneous porous media. The soil was fully saturated by water. Six adjacent HE pipe loops\n28\n were modeled as linear entities embedded in the concrete walls.\nThe HE pipes had an outer diameter of \n\n32\n\nmm\n\n and an inner diameter of \n\n25\n\nmm\n\n. Water was selected as the circulating fluid, with the inflow velocity and temperature specified in Section\u00a02.4. The pipe layout had a vertical W configuration.\nThe model formulation is reported in\u00a0Annex A. The model mesh was created with the following features: (i) the HEs had a maximum mesh size of \n\n10\n\ncm\n\n; (ii) the infrastructure had a mesh size that ranged from \n\n10\n\ncm\n\n in the vicinity of the HEs to \n\n1\n\nm\n\n; (iii) the soil mesh was of \n\n1\n\nm\n\n in the vicinity of the EG and it increased with the distance from the underground infrastructure.\nThe analysis was divided between two solvers: the first was a stationary one, where the thermal and hydraulic boundary conditions were applied. The second was a time dependent solver, that took the solution of the stationary solver as the initial condition. The fluid flow in the pipes was enabled (i.e.,\u00a0geothermal activation) during the time-dependent solver. The details of the thermal input are specified in Section\u00a02.4.\nThe model performance was first tested by reproducing the experimental test conducted at the Shanghai Natural History Museum\n29\n. The numerical model geometry presented in Fig.\u00a01 was adapted to account for the experimental data reported for the Shanghai test\n29\n\n,\n\n30\n. All the model input data are reported in Annex B. The comparison results for the heat carrier fluid inflow (\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n) and outlet (\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n) temperatures reveal close agreement (Fig.\u00a02).\n\nConsidering the complex geometry of the model (Fig.\u00a01), various boundary conditions had to be set. Referring to the numbered boundaries in Fig.\u00a01, thermal and hydraulic boundaries were set to account for two groundwater flow directions. Table\u00a01 presents the selected conditions.\n\nHere \nH\n is the total hydraulic head, \nn\n represents the normal outflow unit vector, \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nw\n\n\n is the water density, \n\n\nq\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n represents the flow vector and \n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nb\nc\n,\ni\n\n\n represents the heat flux through the \ni\nth boundary. \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n1\n,\n4\n\n\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n\n is the temperature (\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n) distribution along the depth (\nz\n, in meters) approximating the near-surface geothermal gradient in the shallower \n\n10\n\nm\n\n of the subsoil profile: \n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n1\n,\n4\n\n\n\n\nz\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n6\n\n\n\u2212\nz\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nm\n\n\n\n\nf\no\nr\n\n0\n<\nz\n\u2264\n\u2212\n10\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nf\no\nr\n\nz\n<\n\u2212\n10\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nT\n\n\n5\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\n6\n\n\n can be obtained from Table\u00a02.\nThe hydraulic head boundary allows the undisturbed groundwater flow velocity (\n\n\nv\n\n\ngw\n\n\n) to be set to different values. In this study \n\n\nv\n\n\ngw\n\n\n ranged from \n\n0\n\nm\n\/\nd\n\n to \n\n2\n\nm\n\/\nd\n\n\n\n18\n\n,\n\n31\u201333\n. Different wall geometries were examined: the total wall height varied between \n\n25\n.\n5\n\nm\n\n and \n\n40\n.\n0\n\nm\n\n. The height of the excavated zone remained as indicated in Fig.\u00a03, while only the embedded height varied. This was chosen to satisfy the geotechnical requirements as from the Eurocode7\n34\n. According to this definition, the ratio (\n\n\nr\n\n\nw\n\n\n) between the total wall height (\n\n\nH\n\n\nw\na\nl\nl\n\n\n) and the retained height (\n\n\n\nH\n\n\nr\n\n\n=\n19\n.\n9\n\nm\n\n as shown in Fig.\u00a03) ranged between \n\n\n\nr\n\n\nw\n\n\n=\n1\n.\n28\n\u00f7\n2\n.\n01\n\n.\n\nThe thermal behavior of the EW may be significantly affected by the hydro-thermal interactions between the wall and the airflow in the tunnel\n21\n\n,\n\n35\n. In some conditions, the heat exchanged in this portion of the structure (i.e., at the wall\u2013air interface) may be predominant: the combination between the air flow velocity and the tunnel air temperature defines the heat exchange. In finite element analyses, convective boundary conditions can be employed to describe this phenomenon, avoiding modeling the complete airflow circulation in the tunnel. This is a flux boundary condition described as follows: \n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nb\nc\n,\ni\n\n\n=\nn\n\u22c5\n\n\nq\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n=\n\n\nh\n\n\na\n,\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n,\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\nr\ne\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nh\n\n\na\n,\ni\n\n\n is the convective heat transfer coefficient, \n\n\nT\n\n\na\n,\ni\n\n\n represents the temperature of the i\nth\n boundary, and \n\n\nT\n\n\nr\ne\nf\n\n\n is the temperature of the porous medium at the wall\u2013air interface.\nIt is difficult to describe and monitor the air environment in tunnels with rectangular cross sections\n36\n, and there is a lack of monitored sites\n21\n. The air temperature in tunnels varies with respect to: the distance from the entrance region, the depth of the tunnel, the influence of the external temperature, the thermal energy released by the passage of trains, the energy dissipated by trains during braking, the crowding of train stations, and eventually the presence of a lighting system. In this study, the temperature values for the air in the tunnel were selected after a dedicated literature review on shallow train tunnels located in Germany, France, Austria and the United Kingdom\n37\u201342\n. The air-flow velocity is directly related to the convective heat transfer coefficient\n21\n. The selected reference values in this study ranged between \n\n2\n.\n5\n\nW\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\/\nK\n\n and \n\n25\n.\n0\n\nW\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\/\nK\n\n.\n\nMoreover, two other environments exchange heat with the EW: a portion of the superstructure and the ground surface (Fig.\u00a03, see locations 8 and 6). At 8, the internal conditions of a building are simulated: the temperature is set as \n\n18\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n accounting for \u201cnear-zero\u201d airflow. At 6, the temperature ranges from \n\n2\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n to \n\n30\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n, aiming at encompassing various thermal environments typical of European climates including worst case scenarios defined as very cold and very hot climates (average temperatures in Helsinki, Finland\n43\n during winter and Palermo, Italy\n44\n during summer), and an average airflow velocity of \n\n2\n.\n5\n\nm\n\/\ns\n\n is accounted. A summary is presented in Table\u00a02.\nTo test the impact of each boundary condition on the thermal exploitation, a dedicated set of preliminary sensitivity analyses was performed, referring to the configurations presented in Table\u00a03. For the analysis, \n\n\nh\n\n\na\n,\ni\n\n\n at the tunnel level was set as \n\n25\n.\n0\n\nW\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\/\nK\n\n only.\n\nNeglecting the heat exchanges between the wall and the air (Config. 1) may lead to a critical underestimation of the thermal potential. On the other hand, accounting for the heat exchanges on a portion of the superstructure may lead to overestimation of the thermal potential (Config. 4). In real applications, at shallow depths, the pipes may be thermally insulated to avoid major thermal losses in the top part of the excavation. Consequently, Config. 3 was adopted for the remainder of the study.\n\n\n2.3\nProperties of involved materials\nThe soil description was chosen to perform a thermal characterization typical of fine- and coarse-grained materials. From a hydraulic viewpoint, the chosen geometric permeability was the one typical for coarse-grained materials\n28\n\n,\n\n33\n, as higher groundwater flow velocities are expected to occur for coarser materials. The infrastructure was made of concrete, and the HE pipes were made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Water was the circulating fluid inside the HEs and the saturating medium in the soil. The details are presented in Table\u00a04.\nA wide variety of hydro-thermal environments in the soil and at the air interfaces were simulated by varying several parameters (Table\u00a05). The variations in the soil thermal conductivity (\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ns\n\n\n) aimed at encompassing the majority of shallow subsoil materials, whereas in the case of concrete (\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n), the thermal conductivity varies in function of a number of parameters, such as the aggregate mix composition and water content (see Section\u00a03.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\nDefinition and choice of thermal input\nThe choice of the thermal input is crucial for defining the thermal behavior of the HE. The selected numerical model includes the convective and conductive heat transfers within the fluid, pipe material, concrete, soil and air. In a real application, the thermal input imposed by the heat pump to the primary circuit satisfies the (total or partial) energy demand of the served superstructure. Because this study deals with the preliminary design stages of a project, there are numerous challenges related to the selection of the thermal input.\nFirst, a broad variety of energy demand curves exist for different types of civil engineering structures and shallow geothermal applications. It is difficult to define a reliable thermal input that is representative of all the possible conditions, for winter and summer operations. Second, the elements constituting the EG exhibit a response that differs with respect to time and space\n45\n depending on the material characterization and on the ongoing multiphysical phenomena, inducing mutual hydro-thermal interactions\n28\n. Third, accounting for a dynamic thermal input implies a high computational cost and large number of runs.\nA trade-off can be achieved by using relatively short-time constant temperature inputs, to detect the response of the EG both in the transient and steady flux conditions, providing a comprehensive overview of the thermal behavior of the HE when either the short term (intermittent) or long term constant modes is selected\n29\n. With a constant temperature input, the thermal response of the HEs is linear depending on the inflow temperature (Fig.\u00a04), but some correlations to the dynamic response can be pointed out. It is possible to evaluate the dynamic thermal behavior of the HE by applying the Duhamel principle: the dynamic problem can be solved by accounting for a sequence of infinitesimal impulses of different amplitudes, as shown in\u00a0Ref.\u00a045. Moreover, at the early stages of EG design, the energy demand curve may not yet be defined with sufficient accuracy. For these reasons, a constant with time temperature input was set. To account for temperature limits that are usually prescribed for EGs (i.e., soil temperature to be maintained between \n\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n and \n\n50\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n), the inflow temperature of the fluid (\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n) in the pipes was set at \n\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n and \n\n25\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n for winter and summer operation, respectively, yielding an average temperature difference between the fluid in the pipes and the soil of \n\n\u2213\n10\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n, as shown in Fig.\u00a04. The power extraction\/injection rate \n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\n, expressed in \n\nW\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n, of the HE loop can be quantified\n10\n\n,\n\n46\n as the enthalpy drop between the inflow and outflow sections: \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nf\n\n\nC\n\n\np\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nf\n\n\n, \n\nC\n\n\np\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nv\n\n\nf\n\n\n represent the density, heat capacity and velocity of the circulating fluid, respectively. \n\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n is the fluid temperature difference between the pipe outflow and inflow, and \n\n\nA\n\n\nW\n\n\n is the equipped surface of the wall.\nA constant fluid velocity of \n\n0\n.\n5\n\nm\n\/\ns\n\n in the pipes was also applied to attain turbulent regime. The duration of the analyses was set to \n\n50\n\nd\n\n, which has proven to be sufficient to reach the steady flux domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\nThe results of the numerical analyses are presented in this section, with a focus on the HE scale and the thermal response of the HEs. The results are presented as charts corresponding to selected times, allowing the short-term and steady flux responses to be evaluated. The time dependent HE response is first described. Second, design charts aiming at highlighting the effects of soil thermal characterization are proposed. The subsequent section is dedicated to the structural thermal characterization. Additionally, a flowchart to be employed for early-stage thermal performance design is proposed. Table\u00a05 presents the ranges of the parameters introduced in Section\u00a02.2.\n\nThe HE\u2019s thermal response was evaluated accounting to the power extraction\/injection rate using\u00a0Eq.\u00a0(3). A fluid velocity and a temperature were imposed at the pipe inlet, while the fluid temperature at the outflow was monitored. According to the time dependency of the thermal response of the HE to a constant thermal input (Section\u00a02.4), two zones were defined (Fig.\u00a05): (i) an initial, time dependent portion (the duration depending on the fluid velocity, the pipe loop length and shape) in which the heat exchanges were governed by the heat capacity and the thermal conductivities of the involved materials (called \u201ctransient\u201d), and (ii) a time-independent phase where the heat exchanges were governed by the thermal conductivities of the materials only (steady flux).\n\nUnder transient conditions, the volume of materials affected by the heat flow quickly increases with time: the portion of soil affected by the thermal exchange was on the scale of decimeters to meters. The groundwater flow presence (if any) interacts with the increasing soil volume in which the heat exchange occurs. Because of this interaction, for the short-term response, the seepage may not significantly enhance the behaviors of the HEs. The impact of the groundwater flow on enhancing the heat transfer process increases as steady flux conditions are approached. Owing to the spatial evolution of the heat exchange processes in the soil, the power injection\/extraction rate decreases with time. The temperature distribution in the soil was hence transient, and the heat front moved in the direction of the seepage\n28\n.\n\n\nOnce the steady flux was reached, the thermal response of the HEs was time independent. This condition was reached after an activation time on the order of \n\n10\n\nd\n\n and allowed us to define and analyze long term energy exploitation scenarios\n29\n. The soil volume involved in the heat exchange reached its definitive evolution and was recorded on the scale of a few cubic meters around the EG. If groundwater flow is present, the soil volume affected by the thermal exchanges was significantly larger depending on the direction and magnitude of the seepage. In this condition, mutual interactions among the seepage and the HE occurred: on one hand, the seepage affected the heat exchanges by moving the heat in the space, and on the other hand, the thermal activation induced local seepage variations\n28\n.\nTo study the time-dependent behavior of the HEs\u2019 response, three time steps were examined, with the aim of comprehensively evaluating the time-dependent heat transfer rates. The selected timesteps were: 2, 5, and 50 d. The first aimed at defining the short-term response (e.g. representing highly intermittent heat pump functioning), the second provided an average value for the transient condition, and the third provided a measure of the long-term seasonal performance.\n\n3.1\nThermal behavior of EG under different environmental conditions\nIn the following section, charts (Figs.\u00a06 and 7) show the power extraction\/injection rate (\n\n\nq\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n, on the y axis) with respect to the groundwater velocity (\n\n\nv\n\n\ng\nw\n\n\n, on x axis), for two different groundwater directions and soil thermal conductivities. In both cases, the results refer to the first pipe loop number (i.e., the one with higher performance); hence all hydraulically induced thermal interactions are neglected. In the subsequent figures, all the results refer to a concrete thermal conductivity of \n\n2\n.\n0\n\nW\n\/\n\n(\nm\n\nK\n)\n\n\n. The significance of this key parameter to the results is discussed in Section\u00a03.2.\nTo illustrate the effect of increasing the number of HE loops, Fig.\u00a08 shows the decrement of the power extraction\/injection rate of adjoining HE loops for selected groundwater flow velocities parallel to the wall. The choice to employ six HE loops was based on a literature review\n28\n, which indicated that the thermal performance of the HEs remains constant after a certain number of HE loops.\n\nFigs.\u00a06 and 7 show the time-dependent decrease (absolute value) of the thermal performance (i.e.,\u00a0power extraction\/injection rate) for the HEs transitioning from transient to steady flux conditions. Notably, the thermal performance of the geostructure for the condition of groundwater flow parallel to the wall was higher than that for the corresponding with perpendicular groundwater flow conditions. This was expected, because the magnitude of \n\n\nv\n\n\ngw\n\n\n for the parallel flow was higher than that for the corresponding case with a perpendicular flow, owing to the seepage. In contrast, in the parallel flow case, hydraulically-induced thermal interactions among adjoining loops affected the thermal behavior, as shown in Fig.\u00a08. Such results may be useful for a preliminary estimation of the energy potential achievable with the HEs embedded in retaining walls for early-stage thermal performance design of the EG. In Figs.\u00a06 and 7, the symbol \nT\n indicates the undisturbed soil temperature (i.e.,\u00a0at the far field).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nEffects of thermal characteristics of structure\nThe effect of the structural thermal characterization on the thermal behavior of the HEs is discussed in this section. The thermal properties of concrete (i.e.,\u00a0the structural material) are typically affected by seven parameters\n47\n: the humidity conditions, age, temperature, water-cement ratio, fine aggregate fraction, type of admixture, and total aggregate volume fraction. The moisture content and temperature are highly important: the thermal conductivity in saturated conditions is 50% higher than that in dry conditions\n48\n. Additionally, in experimental studies, the thermal conductivity increased by approximately 6% with each increment of 1% in the moisture content\n49\n. The aggregate type is another important parameter because concrete is composed of aggregates for about \n\n60\n%\n\u00f7\n80\n%\n\n of its volume. The thermal conductivity is increased by increasing the coarse aggregate volume fraction and keeping the sand ratio unchanged\n48\n. The density is another significant parameter: an increase in the density induces an exponential increase in the thermal conductivity\n47\n.\nThe thermal conductivity of concrete can be engineered to some extent: for EG applications, one can choose a concrete type with better properties than alternatives, but the long-term soil\u2013structure interactions and the implications for the thermal behavior are hardly definable at the design stage. They depend significantly on the hydro-thermal interactions among the materials. In the case of the EW, the interactions between the wall and the air on the excavated side and between the wall and the soil on the other side may locally affect the thermal properties of the structure. To consider such scenarios, in this study, the concrete thermal conductivity was varied from \n\n0\n.\n7\n\nW\n\/\n\n(\nm\n\nK\n)\n\n\n to \n\n2\n.\n0\n\nW\n\/\n\n(\nm\n\nK\n)\n\n\n\n\n47\n. Figs.\u00a09 and 10 indicate the ranges of values of the power extraction\/injection rate with respect to the groundwater flow velocity for different combinations of concrete and soil thermal conductivities. The charts correspond to the first pipe loop, and the hydraulically induced thermal interactions were not considered.\nFor each concrete thermal conductivity value, a surface was identified. The minimum and maximum (absolute) values for each surface corresponded to the low and high soil thermal conductivities, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nA flowchart for early-stage thermal performance design\nThis section aims at linking the subsoil characteristics and environmental air conditions to the energy quantities achievable with EWs by defining a flowchart that can be used not only for the preliminary thermal design of EWs but also for the decision-making process to decide whether to employ EGs in an infrastructure project. The required input parameters are related to the basic hydro-thermal properties of the site: estimations of the thermal properties of the involved materials and the possible presence and velocity of groundwater flow that may significantly interact with the infrastructure. The flowchart comprises two steps. First, according to the fluid dynamics theory, the main heat exchange mechanism is defined. Second, by selecting the input thermal properties, thermal performance of HEs embedded in EWs is estimated. The objective of this section is to propose a design methodology for energy evaluations at preliminary design stages, to address a frequently asked question: how much energy is achievable by using this technology at a known site?\n\n3.3.1\nAnalytical solution and P\u00e9clet number for steady flux calculations\nTo recall some fundamentals of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics, a simple sketch of an EW was made by considering the case of a porous material constantly heated from the side by a rectangular heat source (Fig.\u00a011(a)). In this condition (i.e.,\u00a0steady flux), it was possible to describe the heat transfer process (conduction and convection) analytically. The case of a porous medium fully-saturated with water, with the liquid phase moving at velocity \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n, under two-dimensional (2D) conditions, is presented in Fig.\u00a011(b). Under such conditions, we can determine in which cases the heat exchanges are dominated by conduction (\n\nP\ne\n<\n1\n\n) and convection (\n\nP\ne\n>\n1\n\n), according to the P\u00e9clet number (\n\nP\ne\n\n). This dimensionless quantity is the ratio of the convective transport rate and the conductive transport rate in a continuum. When applied to hydro-thermal phenomena, it is equal to the product of the Reynolds (\n\nR\ne\n\n) and the Prandtl (\n\nP\nr\n\n) numbers: \n\n(4)\n\n\nP\ne\n=\n\n\nc\no\nn\nv\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n\nt\nr\na\nn\ns\np\no\nr\nt\n\nr\na\nt\ne\n\n\nc\no\nn\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n\nt\nr\na\nn\ns\np\no\nr\nt\n\nr\na\nt\ne\n\n\n=\nR\ne\n\nP\nr\n=\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\nx\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nv\n\n\u00af\n\n and \n\n\nx\n\n\u00af\n\n represent the velocity field and the geometrical length of the considered problem and \n\u03b1\n is the thermal diffusivity. For the case shown in Fig.\u00a011(b), we have: \n\n(5)\n\n\nP\ne\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\na\n\n\n2\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n\nThis result can also be obtained by using the following ratio of times\n50\n: \n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nP\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\nt\ni\nm\ne\n\nf\no\nr\n\na\nn\n\ne\nl\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\n\ni\nn\n\nm\no\nt\ni\no\nn\n\nt\no\n\np\na\ns\ns\n\nt\nh\ne\n\nh\ne\na\nt\n\ns\no\nu\nr\nc\ne\n\no\nf\n\nw\ni\nd\nt\nh\n\n2\na\n\n\nt\ni\nm\ne\n\nf\no\nr\n\nt\nh\ne\n\nh\ne\na\nt\n\nt\no\n\nc\no\nn\nd\nu\nc\nt\n\na\n\nd\ni\ns\nt\na\nn\nc\ne\n\n2\na\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nc\no\nn\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nc\no\nn\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\nf\n\nP\ne\n\u226b\n1\n\n\n\nc\no\nn\nv\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n\nd\no\nm\ni\nn\na\nt\ne\nd\n\np\nr\no\nb\nl\ne\nm\n\n\n\n\ni\nf\n\nP\ne\n\u226a\n1\n\n\n\nc\no\nn\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n\nd\no\nm\ni\nn\na\nt\ne\nd\n\np\nr\no\nb\nl\ne\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n2\na\n\n is the width of the heat source (Fig.\u00a011(b)). Then, \n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nc\no\nn\nv\n\n\n=\n\n\n2\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand \n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nc\no\nn\nd\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n\nare obtained by invoking the approximation proposed in\u00a0Ref.\u00a051 which provides a measure of the spatial extent of the heated region based on analysis of the error function.\n\nThis knowledge can be applied to EWs by analyzing the 2D case under the following conditions. For groundwater flow parallel to the wall, the distance \n\n2\na\n\n can be considered as the longitudinal length of the thermo-active walls of the infrastructure (it may range between \n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nm\n\n and \n\u2248\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nm\n\n), and \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n represents the magnitude of the undisturbed groundwater velocity at the wall\u2013soil interface (ranges from \n\n0\n\nm\n\/\nd\n\n to \n\n\u2248\n2\n.\n0\n\nm\n\/\nd\n\n). For groundwater flow perpendicular to the wall, the seepage at the wall\u2013soil interface is directed vertically; hence the distance \n\n2\na\n\n can be considered as the wall height (ranges from \n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nm\n\n to \n\u2248\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nm\n\n), and \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n can be considered as the magnitude of the groundwater velocity at the wall\u2013soil\u200b interface (which is significantly lower than the undisturbed groundwater velocity (\n\n\nv\n\n\nu\n\n\n) because of the seepage path, usually \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n to \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n)\n28\n.\nIn engineering applications, the P\u00e9clet number is typically large. Thus, the limit value that separates the conductive- and convective-dominated regimes must be studied for small values of the parameter a, which is defined as half of the length of a wall panel (e.g.,\u00a0diaphragm walls are usually composed of \n\n1\n.\n5\n\u00f7\n3\n.\n0\n\nm\n\n long adjoining concrete panels) for the case of groundwater parallel to the wall, and as half of the wall height for the case of groundwater perpendicular to the wall (Fig.\u00a012). The thermal diffusivity was studied in the range \n\n1\n\u22c5\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\/\ns\n\n to \n\n2\n\u22c5\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\/\ns\n\n\n\n33\n.\n\nThe maximum limit value of the velocity for reaching the condition \n\nP\ne\n<\n1\n\n was evaluated: for the parallel groundwater flow, \n\n\n\nv\n\n\nu\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2264\n0\n.\n5\n\nm\n\/\nd\n\n.

In conclusion, a velocity value of \n\n\n\nv\n\n\nu\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n5\n\nm\n\/\nd\n\n can be used as a separator between the two main heat exchange modes.\n\n\n3.3.2\nFlowchart for early-stage thermal performance design\nTo propose a flowchart that is based on such results and theoretical principles, the conditions and implications of each heat exchange mode must be defined.\nIn the case of the conductive-dominated regime (i.e.,\u00a0when a groundwater table is not present or \n\n\n\nv\n\n\nu\n\n\n<\n0\n.\n5\n\nm\n\/\nd\n\n), the long-term sustainability of the project must be guaranteed. It is essential to ensure an adequate thermal recharge to the soil mass to avoid unacceptable long term temperature variations\n52\n. In the optimum functioning mode, the cooling and heating operations are balanced. In the case of the convective-dominated regime, a designer must bear in mind that the heat storage is inhibited by the fluid flow that dissipates heat in the surrounding soil mass (i.e., only instantaneous cooling can be performed). Fig.\u00a013 presents the flowchart that can be employed for early-stage thermal performance design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nThis paper summarizes some concepts of hydro-thermal interactions applied to EWs and presented a methodology for the early-stage thermal performance design of such EGs.\nA portion of an energy infrastructure was numerically modeled, and the thermal behavior was discussed with reference to different environmental conditions. Groundwater flow in the soil enhances the heat exchanges but induces adverse hydraulically induced thermal interactions among adjoining pipe loops. The performance of one HE loop under parallel groundwater flow conditions is higher than that for a perpendicular groundwater flow. Within this framework, the time-dependent nature of the HEs response is highlighted. The structural thermal characterization plays a significant role, and precise quantification of the thermal conductivity is hardly feasible, owing to the broad range of values available in the literature, the dependency on many parameters (such as the density and degree of saturation), and the long-term interactions with the soil. Consequently, the response of the HEs may vary significantly.\nA methodology for early-stage thermal performance design of EWs was proposed. It has a sound theoretical basis that helps to account for the multiphysical phenomena interacting with one another (thermodynamics, fluid dynamics) at different scales. Once the basic hydro-thermal characteristics of a site are known, the proposed flowchart can be used to determine the power extraction\/injection rates expressed in \n\nW\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n of the thermo-active surface for heating and cooling operations.\nThis methodology will help designers to perform a preliminary quantification of the energy achievable by equipping an infrastructure with EWs during the early-stage design phases. Moreover, it may impact the decision-making process when the question is whether or not to install thermo-active elements on a planned infrastructure project. The data included in this design tool represent a conservative estimation of the power rate because of the definition of steady flux conditions with respect to the selected thermal input.\nFinally, EWs exhibit considerable potential for energy exploitation. The average values for the power extraction\/injection rate range between \n\n10\n\nW\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n and \n\n50\n\nW\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n. The proposed early-stage thermal performance design methodology may represent a decisive tool for designers to close a gap between researchers and practitioners, enabling the EG technology to be more widely used.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJacopo Zannin: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing - original draft, Visualization, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation.

Geothermal energy is recognised as a clean and renewable energy source which can greatly contribute towards meeting our future energy needs.\n1\n Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) systems, also known as shallow geothermal energy systems, utilise the ground as a heat source or heat sink to provide efficient space heating and cooling. In GSHP systems, a primary circuit embedded in the ground is linked to a secondary circuit installed in the user space with both circuits connected via a heat pump.\n2\u20136\n Ground Heat Exchanger (GHE) is the major component of the primary circuit and comprises of absorber pipes with circulating heat carrier fluid (typically water) embedded in the ground. Taking advantage of the relatively stable and moderate ground temperature at shallow depths (up to 200 m) as well as the considerably large heat capacity of the ground, GSHP systems can achieve 40%\u201360% higher efficiency, 30%\u201340% average operating cost savings and over 40% reductions in pollutant discharges compared to conventional heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.\n7\n Despite the well-known advantages, the primary drawback of the traditional GSHP systems is the high capital investment associated with the drilling and trenching required to install GHEs, which impedes the uptake of this technology.\n8\n\n\nEnergy geo-structures are considered as innovative alternatives to traditional GSHP systems, as geothermal piping is incorporated into foundation structures (such as piles, retaining walls, tunnel linings), allowing them to function as GHEs in addition to serving structural purposes as foundations.\n9\u201317\n This approach eliminates the necessity for drilling or trenching purpose-built GHEs, substantially reducing the required capital investment and furthering the economic viability of GSHP systems.\n10\n\n,\n\n18\u201320\n On the other hand, energy geo-structures bring new challenges to geothermal system design. The geometrical properties and thermal conditions of energy geo-structures have significant disparities with the thoroughly studied traditional borehole systems, suggesting that the available thermal design methods for traditional borehole systems could hardly be adopted, nor adapted, particularly for certain energy geo-structures.\n11\n\n,\n\n21\u201324\n In addition, the operation of GSHP systems induces thermo-mechanical loading on the structures, thus further complicating their structural and thermal analysis and design.\n25\u201328\n Moreover, the design of ground heat exchanger (GHE) is greatly restrained by the structural design, which limits the system\u2019s ability to fulfill the entirety of the thermal demand for the end user, thus requires further guidance and better management of the design thermal load.\nIn recent years, there is growing interest among scientific and industrial communities in the application of shallow geothermal technology to retaining walls. Some experimental and numerical investigations have been undertaken to further understand the thermal and thermo-mechanical performance of energy retaining walls.\n22\n\n,\n\n28\u201336\n The importance of the boundary conditions of the excavation space and the pipe configuration on the thermal performance of energy retaining walls have been specifically addressed. However, most of the energy retaining wall studies have focused on diaphragm walls, while limited works have dealt with piled walls. Brandl\n18\n reported a thoroughly instrumented energy bored piled wall installation in the Lainzer tunnel as a part of heating and cooling system of the railway stations, administration and residential buildings. The measured temperature and strain data demonstrated that the temperature variation from the energy system operation is smaller than those due to natural fluctuations and the temperature-induced deformations are significantly smaller than those induced by the excavation. Suckling and Smith\n37\n described an installation project of energy piles and a bored pile retaining wall at Keble College, Oxford, the first energy pile project in the United Kingdom. Ground loops were casted in piles and subsequently connected to the heating and cooling system of the building above. However, this study has little discussions in the thermal design of these structures, the followed thermal performance of the system in operation has not yet been reported and discussed. Bourne-Webb and da Costa\n38\n presented a high-level study on the effect of differing conditions in the tunnel on the thermal response of the wall using a 2D steady state numerical model. The study emphasised the importance of evaluating tunnel environment in assessing the thermal performance of energy wall systems. Despite these studies, the available literature on energy piled walls is still relatively limited, the experimental data on the thermal performance of energy piled walls are even scarcer, limiting the undertaking of a broader analysis. It should be noted that the diaphragm wall is a continuous wall constructed in-situ panel by panel, while piled walls are formed by constructing a series of piles to support excavation activities and retain soil laterally, the differences in the geometries and construction methods require different thermal design considerations.\nIt is well recognised in the literature\n31\u201333\n\n,\n\n39\n\n,\n\n40\n that the manner in which the GHE is constructed greatly impacts the thermal performance of GSHP systems. Unlike diaphragm walls, in which the pipes can be placed throughout the panels that comprise the wall, pipes in piled retaining walls are likely to be clustered in the piles, potentially resulting in higher concentration of heat and raising concern of thermal interference between closely spaced pipes and piles. Thus, it is important to consider the thermo-active pile spacing into the geothermal design. This paper aims to provide insights and further understanding of the effect of pile spacing on the thermal performance of energy piled walls and contribute to an easily adoptable thermal design approach. Although in real-world applications pile spacing is principally dictated by geotechnical design and unlikely to be affected by geothermal concerns, a comprehensive understanding of the thermal effect of pile spacing can greatly assist in the design and decision making regarding how many piles should be thermally activated in wall systems. Of key interest is the balance between the system thermal performance and the associated material and installation costs of geothermal pipes.\nIn this paper, the effect of pile spacing is evaluated by experimental and numerical studies. A pilot soldier piled wall within an underground metro station, located in Melbourne, Australia, has been thermally activated by embedding geothermal pipes into three adjacent soldier piles in which the pipes were connected in parallel above the ground surface. The wall section has been instrumented, tested and monitored by the University of Melbourne to provide full scale data. The collected data were not only used to investigate the role of thermo-active pile spacing on the thermal performance of the energy soldier piled wall, but also formed important datasets for the validation of numerical modelling approaches of energy piled wall. Detailed finite element modelling is utilised to simulate the thermal performance of the system under different thermo-active pile spacings. In addition, a comprehensive sensitivity study is performed to understand the effect of the pile spacing under various system designs and ground conditions.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nExperimental investigations and finite element modelling are utilised in this study to understand both the short and long-term performance of energy piled walls, focusing on the effect of pile spacing. Section\u00a02.1 presents the experimental study on an instrumented pilot energy soldier piled wall installed within an excavated metro station in Melbourne, Australia. Section\u00a02.1.1 introduces the experimental site in detail and Section\u00a02.1.2 describes two in-situ thermal response test (TRT) set ups conducted on the pilot energy pile wall, covering two different thermo-pile spacings. The experimental investigation concerns the real thermal response of the energy piled wall and enables to provide key insights on the effect of pile spacing on the thermal performance of the system. This is particularly valuable as no such data is currently available for energy piled walls in the literature. To further understand the effect of pile spacing on the thermal performance of energy piled walls for a wide spectrum of cases in real life scenario, a numerical simulation approach described in Section\u00a02.2 is also utilised in this study to perform numerical analyses of energy piled wall systems adopting the metro station as a case study. Section\u00a02.2.1 presents a short overview of the numerical model, while Section\u00a02.2.2 describes in detail the model geometries and boundary conditions adopted in simulating TRT1 and TRT2 for validation purposes. Furthermore, the parameters used to simulate the long-term thermal performance of energy piled walls for assessing the effect of pile spacing are also detailed. To investigate the effect of some other important design parameters on the energy wall design and the thermal performance of the wall, a parametric analysis is introduced in Section\u00a02.2.3. Finally, Section\u00a02.2.4 describes the significance of the effect of pile spacing in the real-world design applications with respect to the energy potential and costs.\n\n\n\n\n2.1\nExperimental study\n\n2.1.1\nPilot energy soldier piled wall\nThis body of work utilises the unique opportunity to work with the Melbourne Metro Railway Authority (MMRA) and the well-known Melbourne Metro project to add field testing and data monitoring on a real-scale energy piled wall. The experimental section of energy piled wall was installed and instrumented in one of the underground station\u2019s shafts of the Melbourne Metro project, which is currently under construction. The main geological formation in the study area is Melbourne formation, which consists of sandstone and siltstone, much weathered close to the surface. Current literature and research indicates that the thermal conductivity of the Melbourne formation is expected to be 2.68 \n\n\u00b1\n0\n.\n62\n\n\u00a0W\/(m\u00a0K).\n41\u201343\n This serves as an excellent material for geothermal projects. The water table was found to lie approximately 15 m below ground surface before the excavation took place, and no ground water flow is observed according to the project record. Prior to the time of the field tests, an acoustic shed had been constructed to cover the excavation space and a temporary ventilation system was installed for dust extraction and thermal comfort during the construction.\nAs seen in Fig.\u00a01, the station is about 15 m in width and 40 m in length, supported by soldier piled walls, formed by 68 bored cast in-situ piles with shotcrete walls in between the piles. Each pile is 1.05 m in diameter and 40 m in depth, with the final embedment depth being 5 m at the completion stage. The centre-to-centre spacing between adjacent piles is 1.8 m, and the thickness of the shotcrete wall applied between the piles is 0.15 m. Four U-loops made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe with an outer diameter of 25\u00a0mm, were connected in series, and attached to the reinforcing steel cages within P49 and P50, and two U-loops were connected in series and attached to P51 (Fig.\u00a02\n). These pile loops have been connected in parallel through a manifold system installed above the surface, resulting in a common joint inlet and outlet. The application of the manifold system allows for activation of different combinations of pile loops depending on study purposes. Amongst these three piles, P50 and P51 have been instrumented with temperature sensors built in strainmeters located at various positions and depth (Fig.\u00a01a). One multi-channel Vibrating Wire datalogger was connected to these sensors to collect pile temperature (and strain) data with an additional temperature sensor embedded in the datalogger indicating the ambient station temperature. These measurements are very valuable for assessing the thermal aspects of the response of the energy soldier pile wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2\nIn-situ TRTs set up\nIn-situ thermal response testing (TRT) involves heating fluid using electrical heating elements at a constant power and circulating the fluid in the pipe loops within a GHE. The inlet and outlet fluid temperatures are recorded over time, as well as the flow rate and power consumption. This test is considered to be the most accurate method to estimate ground thermal parameters, including undisturbed ground temperature, ground thermal conductivity and GHE thermal resistance, as it enables researchers to capture the in-situ ground conditions such as local geology, ground water flow, and states of stress.\n44\u201346\n TRTs have been considered as a standard test for geothermal projects. However, TRTs have mainly been performed on borehole heat exchangers. Over the last few years, the applicability of this test has been extended to energy piles, which share similar geometry and conditions as borehole heat exchangers.\n46\u201353\n TRT data and relevant case studies for energy retaining walls are very scarce, perhaps due to the absence of easily adoptable analytical approaches for data interpretation, the complexity of the test execution, and in certain cases the difficulties of performing the test due to the wall construction methods.\n54\n\n\nTo experimentally investigate the effect of pile spacing as well as to broaden TRT studies on energy retaining walls, two in-situ TRTs, namely TRT1 and TRT2, have been performed on the experimental site in this work under the same excavation level of approximately 32.5 m. In both tests, a pile with 4 U-loops, and a pile with 2 U-loops were connected in parallel via the manifold system (Fig.\u00a03). The spacing between the two pile loops was varied between TRT1 and TRT2 to serve the study purpose. Specifically, TRT1 was conducted on P50 and P51 with a centre-to-centre pile spacing of 1.8 m, while TRT2 was conducted on P49 and P51 with a pile spacing of 3.6 m (Fig.\u00a03). Note that P51 pipe configuration is different from than that of P49 and P50, however given that P51 is involved in both tests, the only major variable involved is pile spacing, all other parameters being approximately equal, including total and individual pile flow rates. To ensure that proper testing conditions had been met, a series of pre-tests were conducted, including bench testing of the TRT unit to ensure its functionality, flushing and purging of the ground loops and manifold system to eliminate air bubbles, and pressure testing to ensure that there was no leakage in the pipe system.\nDuring TRT1 and TRT2, a heating power of 5.5 kW was constantly supplied to the system for a duration of three weeks. A flow sensor was placed inside the TRT unit near the point where the fluid entered the pile loops from the TRT unit. Between the two tests, all heating elements were switched off and only the circulation pump was left running for approximately 3 weeks to help the ground dissipate the remaining heat. The TRT fluid temperatures and flow rate were measured in 10-minute intervals during both tests. In addition to the relevant TRT data, ambient pile and station temperatures during the tests have also been monitored and collected to help further understanding the heat transfer process as well as assessing the effect of thermo-active pile spacing on the thermal response of energy soldier piled walls. A temperature sensor was placed within P50 towards to the station side at a depth of 23.1 m from the ground surface (P50-S) and another two pairs of temperature sensors were placed towards to the ground side of P50 at a depth of 9.0 m and 19.7 m (P50-G). Temperature was also monitored within P51 at a depth of 9.0 m and 19.7 m in both the ground side (P51-G) and the station side (P51-S). The monitored pile temperatures were measured in 5-minute intervals. The pile temperature measurements can contribute to the investigation on the effect of pile spacing, as well as help in differentiating the thermal influence from the ground and the station and provide an understanding of the heat exchange within the different piles at different depths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nNumerical modelling\n\n2.2.1\nOverview\nThe numerical modelling and analyses performed in this work are conducted using a detailed 3D finite element model developed by the University of Melbourne\n40\n\n,\n\n55\n and implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics. The model couples and solves the governing equations of heat transfer and fluid flow characterised by the conservation of momentum, mass, and energy equations. The 3D model considers both heat conduction and convection. The conductive heat transfer primarily occurs in the solid elements such as the ground, the concrete pile, shotcrete wall and the HDPE pipe walls, and partially in the heat carrier fluid inside the pipes, whereas the convective heat transfer mainly occurs in the heat carrier fluid circuiting inside the pipes. For the fluid flow within the pipes, 1D elements are used to model the pipes considering the fluid flow is fully developed. The continuity and momentum equations for impressible fluid flow and the energy equation for conductive\u2013convective heat transfer in the carrier fluid are employed in the 1D pipe element, and the results of the temperature of the pipe wall are coupled to the 3D heat transfer elements in the remaining geometry. Detailed information and the complete governing equations can be found in Refs.\u00a040, 55, 56. The effect of groundwater flow, including the dewatering process, is not covered in this numerical study, which is considered as a conservative approach since the presence of groundwater flow enhances the heat exchange between the absorber piles and the surrounding ground and thus improves the thermal performance of GSHP systems. The numerical model is firstly built to simulate the experimental site under the TRTs conditions to increase the confidence in the numerical model and to further investigate the heat transfer process occurred in the wall during the TRTs. Then the model is modified to investigate the long-term performance of energy retaining wall under operational conditions. Calibrated soil conditions and concrete properties are adopted, and the relevant material properties are listed in Table\u00a01.\n\nReaders will note that the fluid inlet temperatures collected from the in-situ experiments were used as one of the inputs to replicate the TRTs in the numerical simulations as the data are readily available and are able to account for the uncertainties encountered during the actual field tests, such as power fluctuation. On the other hand, GHEs design relies on the building thermal load profile estimated typically by mechanical engineers. Thus, a prescribed thermal load profile is employed to assess the long-term performance of energy walls in terms of resulting fluid temperatures in the long-term numerical simulations under realistic operational conditions, further details are included later in Section\u00a02.2.5. It is noted that in the general literature the thermal performance of GSHP systems are customarily assessed by employing a constant fluid inlet temperature over time.\n24\n\n,\n\n28\n\n,\n\n32\n\n,\n\n57\n This approach reports a heat exchange power value expressed in W\/m or W\/m2 that is simple to use for comparison and often used in nominal mechanical design. However, under real operating conditions, the GSHP systems operate under varying and complex inlet temperature over time, in response to varying thermal loads only available in the design stage when detailed building energy models are undertaken. In this work, the long-term operational simulations use the latter approach, with the provision of time-varying thermal loads as input rather than nominal constant inlet temperatures.\n\n\n2.2.2\nModel validation with short term experimental TRT data\nThe geometry and boundary conditions for simulating the TRTs are shown in Fig.\u00a04. The model incorporates two energy soldier piles with a thin layer of concrete wall. A parallel piping circuit is used, with two branches separated into two soldier piles respectively and joined slightly above the ground surface. One branch consists of 4 U-loops connected in series, a total length of approximately 320 m, and the other branch consists of 2 U-loops approximately 160 m long in total. The model has relatively large dimensions with the bottom surface extending 10 m below and 30 m to either side of the wall, expecting that the heat transfer from the energy wall does not affect the temperature at the far end surfaces. The initial temperature of the ground is set as 18.0 \u00b0C, from the pile sensor measurement prior to TRT1 commencement, a constant temperature of the same magnitude is set at the bottom surface. This is deemed as an acceptable assumption as most surrounding area of the experimental site is covered by buildings, and the ground temperature minorly affected by the seasonal variation of the outside air temperature. A detailed study also shows that the seasonal variation in ground temperature has little impact on the interpretation of TRTs in ground thermal conductivity, given the test short duration relative to a season.\n58\n The remaining boundary surfaces in the yz and xz planes are placed far away from the activated piles which unlikely to be affected by the TRTs operation, thus thermal insulation is applied at these boundary surfaces to render zero thermal flux through these surfaces. The results are similar to applying a fixed temperature at these boundary surfaces due to the distance chosen. The measured ambient station temperature shown in Fig.\u00a08 was prescribed along the excavation surfaces of the station shaft and the top boundary, in line with the measured ambient temperatures of the excavation space. The measured inlet temperatures, discretised at 10-minute intervals, and constant average volumetric flow rates\n1\n\n\n1\nThe ambient temperature and fluid inlet temperature employed in the TRTs simulations are taken from the measured values from the in-situ tests, discretised in a time-step of 10\u00a0min. The pipe fluid flow rate is noticeably steady and thus an average constant value is used in the simulations.\n are prescribed at the joint inlet pipe node as inputs to simulate the TRTs. The outlet temperatures are computed by solving the numerical model and then compared against the in-situ test data. The model is firstly built to reproduce TRT1 by calibrating the \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n. The initial guess of the values are established from the available literature based on the material and geology information.\n43\n\n,\n\n59\n\n,\n\n60\n The value of all other parameters is set constant and established from the laboratory measurements and the literature and are known to be less influential than thermal conductivity. Among them, \n\n\nC\n\n\np\n,\ng\n\n\n is measured from Tci sensor tests on \n>\n50 rock cores from different sites with the same geology,\n43\n and \n\n\nC\n\n\np\n,\nc\n\n\n is selected from the value reported in literature This is generally considered acceptable as \n\n\nC\n\n\np\n,\nc\n\n\n is less important in GHE design in both the IGSHPA and ASHRAE methods.\n61\n To ensure its capability of accurately representing the heat transfer process in the wall, the calibrated parameters are further tested against the field data from TRT2. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the residuals and the coefficient of determination (\nR\n\n2) are computed in evaluating the goodness of fit of the numerical model. Simulated pile temperatures are also compared with the measured pile temperatures to provide more confidence in the numerical model.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3\nThe long-term effect of pile spacing\nThe numerical model was then modified to study the overall effect of thermo-active pile spacing on the long-term performance of energy pile walls adopting the material properties listed in Table\u00a01. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a05, the model incorporates a single pile with 4 U-loops taking the advantage of applying symmetry along the zy planes which assumes the energy soldier pile wall extends indefinitely along the \nx\n-axis with the same ground loop design (a conservative approach). Thus, the model width in the x direction is adjusted to the desired centre-to-centre pile spacing, with the modelled pile sits in the middle. To be consistent with the geotechnical design of the case study, three designs with a centre to centre (C-C) thermo-active pile spacing of 1.8 m, 3.6 m, and 5.4 m are firstly assessed in this study, which represents options to thermally activate every pile, every second pile, or every third pile. Thermally inactive piles are not explicitly modelled to save computational time, this is deemed as appropriate since the thermally inactive piles interfere minimally in the heat transfer process. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a0A.1 in the Appendix, the thermally activated pile interacts mostly with the surrounding soil and little with the adjacent inactive piles. All other simulating aspects are kept the same for isolating the effect of pile spacing. The excavation depth is adjusted to 35 m in line with the design at the operation stage. Besides, a constant operational volumetric flow rate of 5.5 L\/min is used to all simulations. The material properties listed in Table\u00a01. The initial temperature of the ground is set as 18.0 \u00b0C and thermal insulation is applied at the top surface assuming the area majorly covered by buildings and pavements. Thermal insulation is also adopted for the excavation space assuming no heat leakage from or into the space. This is suggested by Ref.\u00a022 as a more conservative design option in terms of the operational limits of the GSHP systems. This option is also more desirable in real applications, making it easier to maintain the thermal comfort of the station. The main differences between TRTs simulations and long-term performance evaluation of energy piled walls are summarised in Table\u00a02.\n\n\nThe nature of design thermal load plays a significant role in the long-term performance of GSHP systems, neither a heavily heating nor cooling dominant situation is favourable 22. Therefore, a relatively balanced load distribution between heating and cooling demand, as presented in Fig.\u00a06, is adopted as a standard thermal load (std) design in this study. Cooling demand is supplied for most months, while a large amount of heating demand is concentrated over winter (June, July and August). Noting that this ideal \u2018balanced\u2019 load may not arise from a single building demand, ways to achieve it include adopting smart energy management and control techniques which involve third-party users and combine multiple thermal patterns,\n62\n\n,\n\n63\n or introducing a hybrid system where a second auxiliary system is installed to reduce the peak loads.\n64\u201366\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4\nParametric analysis\nAdopting the long-term (second) model described in Section\u00a02.2.2, various simulations are run to investigate the impact of some other key design parameters, including wall depths (\n\n\nd\n\n\nwall\n\n\n), ground thermal conductivities (\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n) and thermal loads, on the effect of pile spacing and the thermal performance of energy walls. The values of these parameters are summarised in Table\u00a03. \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n is an important parameter input for GHEs design.\n61\n\n,\n\n67\n To study the impact of activated pile spacing under different geology conditions, three values of \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n are chosen, with a lower bound of 0.85 W\/(m\u00a0K) and an upper bound of 2.85 W\/(m\u00a0K) to represent typical \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n value encountered on site, where the calibrated site-specific ground thermal conductivity falls into the upper range. Three wall depths are modelled, including 10 m, 20 m, and 40 m, to present typical retaining wall design depths. Lastly, three different thermal loads were used, including the standard thermal load presented previously in Fig.\u00a06 as well as two variations of it with a 20% increase\/decrease of load for every month. For every combination of these three parameters, three simulations were run for a pile spacing of 1.8 m, 3.6 m, and 5.4 m, adding up to a total of 81 possible design scenarios. It should be noted that all other design parameters and conditions, including the embedment depth, are kept the same for all scenarios to isolate their effects. We note however, that keeping embedment depth constant varies the exposed\/embedded wall depth ratio and may affect total wall heat exchange rates.\n\n\n2.2.5\nEvaluating performance and considering real design applications\nCustomarily the thermal performance of energy geostructures is assessed by evaluating the exchanged heat or thermal power (\nQ\n), from the fluid flow rate (\nq\n) and the fluid temperature difference between the circuit inlet and outlet (\n\n\nT\n\n\nin\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2212\n\u00a0\n\n\nT\n\n\nout\n\n\n), as \nQ\n\n\n=\n Cp \n\u22c5\nq\u00a0(\n\n\nT\n\n\nin\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2212\n\u00a0\n\n\nT\n\n\nout\n\n\n), where Cp is the heat capacity of the fluid. Here a different approach is used, in this study the thermal performance of the energy wall is assessed in terms of the resulting fluid temperatures within the circuit quantified by \n\n\nT\n\n\nmean\n\n\n (the mean temperature between the inlet and outlet pipes, \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nmean\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nin\n\n\n+\n\n\nT\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n). The fluid temperature is an important indicator in the performance evaluation of GSHP systems, as GSHPs needs to be maintained within a specified range to ensure efficiency and functionality during operation, and thus to ensure an acceptable design. Typical lower and upper operational limits for a GSHP are adopted in this work for evaluation purposes, 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 35\u00a0\u00b0C respectively, while noting that these limits may change depending on the chosen GSHP model and its specifications. A typical life span of 25\u00a0years is adopted for all simulations in this study to replicate a realistic operational period for the systems and \n\n\nT\n\n\nmax\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nmin\n\n\n, which represent the maximum and minimum \n\n\nT\n\n\nmean\n\n\n over the whole simulation period, are computed to assess if these values in the simulated scenarios exceed the operational limits of the heat pump. If this is the case, the GSHP system is considered as not able to satisfy the selected design thermal load.\nGenerally, the less extreme the fluid temperatures, the more efficient the GSHP, and the better performance of the energy wall system. In the cases of balanced heating and cooling operation, \n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n (calculated by \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n), captures the extreme temperature responses and thus can be used to represent the thermal performance for each design. To assess the impact of pile spacing on each design scenario, comparisons are made between the simulation results of the pile spacing of 3.6 m and 5.4 m, with respect to 1.8 m. A single value, \n\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n\n (the difference between the \n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n) is used in this study to further capture the difference between the compared pile spacings. The larger the \n\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n\n, the more significant the difference in the thermal performance of the compared cases will be (note that this statement is valid for fairly balanced thermal load cases like the ones shown here but may not be applicable to other situations).\nAs mentioned previously, investigating the effect of pile spacing can greatly assist in justifying the number of piles to be thermally activated in an energy piled wall. This is relevant for both the energy potential and the investment in activating piles. In this work, \n\n\nE\n\n\nmax\n\n\n, the maximum energy potential, is determined by varying the standard thermal load (using the same factors for both heating and cooling) until the resulting \n\n\nT\n\n\nmax\n\n\n or \n\n\nT\n\n\nmin\n\n\n is as close as possible to the operational limits to ensure the efficiency of the GSHP is not compromised. The maximum energy potential achieved by activating all piles within an energy piled wall system \n\n\nE\n\n\nmax,1.8m\n\n\n (simulating a pile spacing of 1.8 m) is compared with the maximum potential for thermally activating one half \n\n\nE\n\n\nmax,3.6m\n\n\n and one third \n\n\nE\n\n\nmax,5.4m\n\n\n of the total piles (simulating pile spacings of 3.6 m and 5.4 m respectively) for each designs scenario. The relative energy potential of the energy piled wall system \n\u03b7\n is calculated as: \n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nmax\n,\n3\n.\n6\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nmax\n,\n1\n.\n8\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n1\n\/\n3\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nmax\n,\n5\n.\n4\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nmax\n,\n1\n.\n8\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n expressed in % to gain a better idea of how much the energy potential differs from the number of thermally activating piles for the whole energy piled wall system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nExperimental observations\nAs explained in Section\u00a02.1, two TRT tests were undertaken and monitored within this study, the results of which, in terms of the measured inlet and outlet fluid temperatures, are shown in Fig.\u00a07. The flow rates for TRT1 and TRT2 were also measured during the test, with the averages being 22.0 L\/min and 22.3 L\/min respectively. Given that P51 incorporated less pipe length than P49 and P50 do (recall Fig.\u00a03), the flow rates in the individual piles differ, being approximately 12.7\u00a0L\/min for P51 and approximately 8.8\u00a0L\/min for piles P49 and P50. TRT1 involved P50 and P51 (\n\u223c\n1.8\u00a0m apart) and TRT2 involved P49 and P51 (\n\u223c\n3.6 m apart), given the P51 is involved in both tests, the only major variable in the tests is pile spacing, all other parameters being approximately equal, including total and individual pile flow rates.\n\nAs shown in the figure, both tests have displayed similar trends for the first two weeks, increasing sharply at the beginning and becoming steadier and steadier which are very much typical thermal response curves for traditional borehole systems, but the fluid temperatures in TRT2 is maintained slightly higher than TRT1. It should be noted here that the starting inlet temperature for TRT2 is 19.7\u00a0\u00b0C, which is 1.3\u00a0\u00b0C higher than the starting temperature for TRT1 (18.4\u00a0\u00b0C). This suggests that there was residual heat at the beginning of TRT2 resulting from the running of TRT1. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that the fluid temperatures in TRT1 start to rise again after the second week, while the fluid temperatures in TRT2 remained rather steady. A possible reason for this would be that there was stronger thermal interference between the closely spaced P50 and P51 piles after the second week, causing the somehow unexpected temperature build up in TRT1. On the other hand, P49 and P51 in TRT2 are spaced further apart, and thus in TRT2 less thermal interference was observed. Another possible cause for this would be the rising temperature in the station air space might be due to change in the weather or operation of ventilation systems.\n\nTemperatures along the piles in both the ground (G) and station shaft (S) sides were also measured during the TRT. Fig.\u00a08 shows the pile temperatures and ambient station temperatures during TRT1 and TRT2 measured by the temperature sensors embedded in the strainmeter bars (Fig.\u00a01). First, it is observed that the ambient station temperatures fluctuate during both testing periods. There is a noticeably increase in the ambient temperature in the 15th and 16th days in TRT1 and 2nd and 3rd days in TRT2. The measured temperatures of the piles are more stable than the ambient station temperature since the beginning of the tests due to the facts that the ground and concrete can hold heat better than air does (higher heat capacity coefficients), and the thin layer of the shotcrete wall and concrete pile cover may also provide additional thermal buffer to the ground. Looking at the temperature sensors placed closer to the station side (S-sensors) of the piles, all of them have shown more fluctuating records than the ground side (G-sensors) of the piles. This is not surprising, since S-sensors were placed close to the station shaft air, thus heavily affected by the airflow and temperature conditions in the station. On the contrary, the G-sensors placed approximately one meter away from the wall surface but close to the ground loop placements. Thus, the temperatures are minimally affected by the station conditions but instead are largely affected by the heating tests, showing similar increasing thermal response trends to the fluid temperatures in Fig.\u00a07. In TRT1, the pile temperature measurements (both G-sensors and S-sensors) captured the temperature build-up after two weeks in both activated piles (P50 and P51), which correlates with the fluid temperature build-up observed in Fig.\u00a07. It should be noted that the temperatures in the excavated station have also increased in this period, thus the build-up temperature at later stages of the test may result from the thermal interference or the change in the testing conditions or the combined effect of both factors. In TRT2, the sensor in the thermally inactivated pile (P50) has recorded a very gradual temperature rise after two days of the test commencement, indicating a lack of thermal interference and an appropriate pile spacing to avoid it. Regardless which side of the wall is being considered, it is observed that there is little temperature variation with respect to different depths of the wall. The small temperature variation in P50-G-9.0 and P50-G-19.7 may be due to the variable pipe separation along the length of the pile\n68\n or sensor calibration difference.\nIn summary, field observations suggest that activating every adjacent pile in the present soldier pile wall may introduce some thermal interference, which can impact energy efficiency over long-term operation. The monitoring results also highlight the importance of thermal condition of the excavation space on the heat transfer process of the energy wall, which suggests that the boundary condition of the wall should be carefully considered in the thermal analysis and system design. Despite the insightful observations from the thermal response of the real soldier pile wall since, the collected data is still limited and fails to capture the complete response of the wall. Moreover, these tests are considered short-term compared to typical geothermal system operational time (e.g.,\u00a025 to 50\u00a0years). The results of numerical simulations are presented in Section\u00a03.2 to further evaluate the thermal significance of pile spacing on energy piled walls under long-term operation.\n\n\n3.2\nNumerical results\n\n3.2.1\nExperimental vs. numerical results\nThe results from the first numerical model described earlier are presented in Fig.\u00a09 in terms of outlet temperature and pile temperature. There is an excellent agreement between the in-situ experimental and the modelling outlet fluid temperatures for both TRT1 and TRT2 (Fig.\u00a09(a) and (b)) when using a \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n of 2.3 W\/(m\u00a0K) and a \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n of 1.6 W\/(m\u00a0K). Fig.\u00a0A.2 in the Appendix illustrates the calibration process and sensitivity of the numerical model responses to other different \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n values. All the simulated TRT outlet fluid temperatures are compared against that measured in-situ experimentally, with results expressed in terms of RMSE. Results seem to be more sensitive to the thermal conductivity of the concrete (pile) than to the thermal conductivity of the ground. Given the known relative insensitivity of results to variations in heat capacity of materials (in this case), these were not calibrated as previously pointed out. The final calibrated ground thermal conductivity is close to the upper range of the reported values in 59 for saturated Melbourne siltstone and sandstone. The final calibrated concrete thermal conductivity also falls in the thermal conductivity range of reinforced concrete reported in Ref.\u00a069. The temperature build-up after the second week of TRT1 commencement is also successfully captured in the simulation. The simulated pile temperatures have also demonstrated very good agreement with the experimental results in both TRT1 and TRT2 as illustrated in Fig.\u00a09(c) and (d) yet some disagreement can be noticed. The disparity most likely rises from the unavoidable uncertainties in the actual construction such as the variable separation between pipe and the pile sensors,\n68\n and variability in material properties and geometry (e.g.\u00a0piles not perfectly cylindrical or vertical, ground layering and discontinuities, etc.) Overall, the simulation results provide confidence in using the model to simulate the heat transfer process and thermal performance of energy pile walls.\n\nThe simulations are further explored to understand the thermal response of the energy wall during the TRTs. In Fig.\u00a010 it is observed that there is a strong thermal interference between the thermo-active soldier piles at the end of TRT1 commencement and is more pronounced for the excavated part. Meanwhile in TRT2, the thermoactivated piles are placed far enough apart to mitigate thermal interaction between the heating piles. These observations further support the conclusion drawn from the measured experimental data in Section\u00a03.1. Furthermore, it is observed that the heat above the excavation level is concentrated in the ground side while when looking below the excavation level, the ground on both sides is activated, which highlights the thermal difference between energy retaining walls and the traditional borehole systems\/energy piles. It is also interesting to observe how the thermal boundary conditions applied on the excavated surface affected the heat transfer process of the wall during the TRTs. Comparing the surface plots at a depth of 20 m and 39.5 m after 16 days of TRT1 commencement, it is believed that the sudden temperature rise seen at 14 days of TRT1 observed in Figs.\u00a07 and 8 may result from not only the thermal interference of the heating piles but also the rising temperature in the station. The impact of the station temperature to the TRT1 is also confirmed when the excavation and top surfaces are set to a constant temperature of 18.5\u00a0\u00b0C in the numerical model (equivalent to the average measured station temperature during the testing period) as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0A.3 included in\u00a0Appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2\nThe long-term effect of pile spacing\nThe next analysis of this work investigates the thermal performance of an energy soldier pile wall at a pile spacing of 1.8 m, 3.6\u00a0m and 5.4 m over 25-years operating period, while adopting the standard thermal load shown in Fig.\u00a06. The results are presented in Fig.\u00a011, where the right figure summarises the maximum and minimum mean fluid temperatures during the operational period shown on the left, with respect to the operational limits of the system and the undisturbed ground temperature. It can be seen that the larger the thermo-active pile spacing, the lesser the extreme temperature responses resulting a narrower range of mean fluid temperatures, and consequently the better the performance of the energy piled wall. The significance of thermo-active pile spacing is particularly evident for the change from 1.8 m (thermally activate all piles) to 3.6 m (thermally activate every second piles). The maximum temperature drops from 32.5\u00a0\u00b0C to 26.4\u00a0\u00b0C resulting in a difference of 6.1\u00a0\u00b0C. A greater difference of 8.0\u00a0\u00b0C occurs in the minimum temperatures changing from \n\u2212\n3.8\u00a0\u00b0C to 4.2\u00a0\u00b0C. The change between the larger pile spacing of 3.6 m and 5.4 m are relatively small, with a similar degree of change for the maximum and minimum fluid temperature (1.8\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.9\u00a0\u00b0C respectively). This suggests that the thermal interference between the piles with a spacing of 3.6 m exists but is rather insignificant and that increasing the pile spacing has diminishing returns in terms of performance gains. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.\u00a011(b) the first design with a pile spacing of 1.8 m operates slightly outside the limits, while the other two designs are able to confidently operate within the limits. This implies that the first design would have difficulties fulfilling the standard thermal load, while the other two designs have spare capacity to supply more energy than the standard load. In addition, it is noted that the variation between years is very minor for all three cases, suggesting minimal heat accumulation in the ground and highlighting the contribution of balanced thermal loads.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3\nParametric analyses\nIt has been demonstrated that the thermal interference that results from closely spaced piles has negative effects on the thermal performance of energy wall systems. It is of interest to see how the effect of pile spacing varies with other key design parameters. Completed thermal performance analyses have been carried out in various combinations of \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n, \n\n\nd\n\n\nwall\n\n\n and design thermal load (Table\u00a02) for a pile spacing of 1.8 m, 3.6 m and 5.4, consisting of a total of 81 different scenarios. Fig.\u00a012 shows the results for 27 representative cases in terms of \n\n\nT\n\n\nmax\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nmin\n\n\n, each subplot includes nine cases focusing on one of the parameter from Table\u00a02, (a) for \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n, (b) for design thermal load, and (c) for \n\n\nd\n\n\nwall\n\n\n, with other input parameters kept constant. It should be noted that the analyses undertaken are of a generic nature and the conclusion is applicable to all the analysed scenarios, some include unviable geothermal designs, but shown for completeness of trend analysis. In Fig.\u00a012(a) it is observed that the higher the thermal conductivity of the surrounding ground, the less extreme the temperature response and thus the better the thermal performance of the GSHP systems. This effect is more predominant in the case of the closest pile spacing (1.8 m). Therefore, the thermal conductivity of the ground is a more important design parameter in the case of closely spaced piles. Fig.\u00a012(b) demonstrates how the thermal performance varies when the system is required to provide different amount of thermal energy. As can be seen, the larger the thermal load provided by each pile, the poorer the performance. It is interesting to observe that there is a linear relationship between the temperature response and the design thermal loads with the steepest gradient occurs for the closest pile spacing. In other words, the thermal performance of the closely spaced piles is more sensitive subjected to the change of the amount of thermal load, thus requires more conscious judgement in design thermal load. Based on Fig.\u00a012(c), it is clear that the deeper the wall depth, the less extreme the fluid temperature as the GSHP systems significantly benefits from a larger area of ground contact and thus heat exchange. This is more evident when the pile spacing becomes closer.\n\n\nFig.\u00a013 shows the complete parametric analyses of all 81 different design scenarios, with the comparison made between a pile spacing of 3.6 m and 1.8 m in (a) and between a pile spacing of 5.4 m and 1.8 m expressed in terms of \n\u0394\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n as explained in Section\u00a02.2.3. Taking the scenario where \n\n\nd\n\n\nwall\n\n\n is 40 m, \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n is 1.85 W\/(m\u00a0K) and 1.2 times of standard thermal load (1.2 std) as an example (refer to Fig.\u00a012b), a pile spacing of 1.8 m results in a minimum and maximum \n\n\nT\n\n\nmean\n\n\n of 37.0\u00a0\u00b0C and -9.2\u00a0\u00b0C, creating a \n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n of 46.2\u00a0\u00b0C. Comparably, a pile spacing of 3.6 m results in a less extreme minimum and maximum \n\n\nT\n\n\nmean\n\n\n of 29.1\u00a0\u00b0C and 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C, creating a smaller \n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n of 28.7\u00a0\u00b0C. Thus, the difference in \n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n between a pile spacing of 3.6 m and 1.8 m, \n\u0394\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n, is 17.5\u00a0\u00b0C as highlighted in Fig.\u00a013. All the comparisons agree that the system performance substantially benefits from larger pile spacings. \n\u0394\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nrange\n\n\n varies from 10.3\u00a0\u00b0C and 64.5\u00a0\u00b0C for the comparison between 3.6 m and 1.8 m and varies from 13.0\u00a0\u00b0C and 76.1\u00a0\u00b0C for the comparison between 5.4 m and 1.8 m respectively. The most significant difference in both comparisons occurred in the combination of the shortest wall depth is (10 m), the lowest thermal conductivity (0.85 W\/(m\u00a0K)) and the largest design load (1.2 std) while the smallest difference occurred in the opposite scenario. It is also observed that the temperature response is the most sensitive when subjected to the change in \n\n\nd\n\n\nwall\n\n\n and the least sensitive in the change in \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n, which suggests that the wall size is the critical parameter in determining the systems\u2019 design and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4\nDesign application\nAs discussed and shown, larger pile spacing results in a better performance in the energy piled wall. The downside of increased pile spacing, and hence fewer thermally activated piles is the reduction in the overall amount of piles that can be activated (since the total number of piles is finite) and therefore the thermal potential or yield of the system. The maximum energy potential of each design case is taken as the modified design thermal load which results in a \n\n\nT\n\n\nmin\n\n\n value of 0\u00a0\u00b0C and \n\n\nT\n\n\nmax\n\n\n of no more than 35\u00a0\u00b0C. This range guarantees the optimal GSHP system performance, as illustrated in Figs.\u00a011 and 12. The maximum energy potential was computed by employing the linear relationship between computed fluid temperature and the thermal load found in this study (a simple predictive method consistent with published literature\n70\n). The relative energy potential for thermally activating every other pile and every other second pile, where the number of thermal piles is reduced to 1\/2 and 1\/3 of the total piles respectively, are compared to thermally activating all piles in the piled retaining walls system, and the results are summarised in Fig.\u00a014.\nAmong the studied parameters, \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n was found to be an influential parameter in relative energy potential. Varying \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n from 0.85 W\/(m\u00a0K) to 2.85 W\/(m\u00a0K) would result in 6%\u20137% increase in relative energy potential for the case of activating 1\/2 of the total piles and 9%\u201310% increase for the case of activating 1\/3 of the total piles, which further implies that thermally activating all piles (creating the closet thermo-active pile spacing) in the case of higher thermal conductivity is a less attractive design option. On the other hand, varying \n\n\nd\n\n\nwall\n\n\n shows little change in the relative energy potential, which suggests the \n\n\nd\n\n\nwall\n\n\n would unlikely affect the decision on how many piles should be activated.\nThis study found that thermally activating all piles provides the maximum energy potential from the energy wall systems. Thermally activating 1\/2 of the piles can provide more than 70% of the maximum energy potential for all studied cases and thermally activating 1\/3 of the piles can provide more than 50% of the maximum energy potential in the majority of cases analysed due to the lower inter-pile thermal interference. In terms of the energy provided per pile, this value increases to between 140%\u2013156% and between 147%\u2013180% when activating 1\/2 and 1\/3 of the piles respectively. Like many other engineering projects, GHE design decisions are largely influenced by capital costs. Thermally activating less number of piles reduces the associated material and labour costs in equipping a pile with necessary piping, the cost saving may be however modest.\n10\n\n,\n\n71\n The fact that activating every pile in the wall system provides the highest total energy potential accomplish this design option to be most favourable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nSummary and conclusion\nThe effects of pile spacing on the thermal performance of GSHP systems have been thoroughly studied through both experimental investigations and numerical simulations. A soldier piled retaining wall system within a deep excavated metro station in Melbourne, Australia was used as a case study. A segment of the wall has been thermally activated by incorporating absorber pipes in three adjacent soldier piles. Temperature sensors were also incorporated in these piles to further provide data during the experiments. Two in-situ thermal response tests have been conducted on this experimental site, aiming to investigate the effect of pile spacing on real energy piled walls. The collected testing and monitoring data provide important insights regarding the thermal response of energy piled walls and established important databases for the validation of analytical and numerical models. To gain a comprehensive understanding on the effect of pile spacing on the thermal performance of energy piled walls under long-term operation, finite element modelling was utilised. This effect has been further explored under different geotechnical designs (represented herein by retaining wall depths), ground conditions (represented herein by the ground thermal conductivities) and thermal designs (design thermal loads). Considering the real-world application of energy piled wall design, the effect of pile spacing on the energy potential of the system is studied to assist the design and decision making, such as on the number of wall piles that should be thermal activated. The key findings of this work are highlighted below:\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the thermal interference between closely spaced piles can occur in a relative short time (2 weeks in this case), resulting in a temperature build-up in the circulating fluid. This could disadvantage the thermal performance of the energy wall system.\n\n\n(2)\nA 3D finite element model has been validated against the experimental results which proves its representativeness and validity in simulating the thermal behaviour of the energy piled wall system.\n\n\n(3)\nThe simulation results from the validated model show that separating thermo-active piles at a greater distance diminishes the effect of thermal interference between the piles, benefitting system performance to a certain extent. The degree of the performance improvement decreases with spacing as the thermal interference between the piles becomes less influential in controlling the fluid temperature. This conclusion remains true in all the studied design scenarios presented in the parametric analyses.\n\n\n(4)\nThe parametric analyses suggest that the depth of the wall is the most influential factor on the thermal performance of the energy wall system as it controls the amount of ground volume that the GHEs engage. For shallower walls, the effect of pile spacing becomes more pronounced. On the other hand, the thermal conductivity of the ground shows a lesser impact on the thermal performance of the wall. Moreover, it was found that the circulating fluid temperatures responded linearly with the change in design thermal load. This finding is particularly valuable in determining the maximum energy potential of the system by controlling the desired fluid temperature.\n\n\n(5)\nThis study recognises that actual design pile spacing is unlikely to be affected by the geothermal design but understanding the effect of pile spacing can help in justifying how many of the piles may be thermally activated. Compared to activating all piles (which naturally has the highest thermal energy provision potential), activating every other pile (one-half of the piles) to double the thermo-active pile spacing provides 70%\u201380% of the maximum energy potential, while activating ever other second pile (one third of the piles) to triple the effective pile spacing, delivers 50% to 60% of the maximum energy potential. Overall, it is suggested that activating all piles in the wall systems is the most desirable option considering the modest capital cost savings of activating less number of piles.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nYu Zhong: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft.

To limit the impact of natural gas production, particularly from smaller fields, a variety of concepts have been proposed for injecting fluids into the reservoir to mitigate reservoir compaction, either through pressure restoration\n3\n\n,\n\n7\n or chemical manipulation.\n8\n Any of such actions clearly requires a firm understanding of the mechanical response of the reservoir rock.\nSubsurface fluid injection into aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs also plays an important role in other strategies to reduce carbon emissions, notably in the context of geothermal electricity generation and geothermal heating of homes and building infrastructure.\n1\n\n,\n\n9\n In addition, depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs are targeted for permanent disposal of wastewater\n10\n and CO2, and for temporary storage of renewable energy\n11\n in the form of synthetic fuels,\n12\n compressed air,\n13\n or hydrogen.\n14\n In principle, all of these activities can potentially induce environmental and\/or geological risks.\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n Induced seismicity is frequently observed in areas of active wastewater injection\n17\n\n,\n\n18\n and in the vicinity of geothermal projects.\n19\n\n,\n\n20\n Furthermore, injected fluids have the potential to leak, leading to economic loss\n21\n and\/or environmental impact.\n22\u201324\n To avoid these unwanted effects it is once again important to understand the response of the reservoir rock to the mechanical and chemical changes caused by fluid injection.\nFluid production or injection affects the pore pressure (\n\n\nP\n\n\np\n\n\n) in the reservoir rock relative to the constant overburden stress (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n), changing the effective stress acting on the reservoir rock, according to Terzaghi\u2019s effective stress principle \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n,\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nP\n\n\np\n\n\n\n. Consequently, the reservoir rock may respond poro-elastically,\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n thus affecting the state of stress in and around the reservoir. However, other effects, which are less well-understood, include permanent (inelastic) deformation of the reservoir, in response to increased contact stresses during fluid extraction,\n27\u201330\n or to changes in the chemical environment during fluid injection and resulting fluid\u2013rock interactions.\n8\n These changes may activate processes leading to time-independent or even time-dependent permanent deformation of the reservoir rock, such as intergranular sliding, grain rotation and rearrangement,\n31\u201334\n brittle failure of grains and grain contacts,\n28\n\n,\n\n35\u201337\n intergranular clay film deformation,\n27\n\n,\n\n38\n stress-driven solution transfer\n39\u201342\n and mineral dissolution\/reaction due to fluid disequilibrium.\n43\n\n,\n\n44\n\n\nMuch work has been done on the deformation behaviour of reservoir rocks in response to applied stress, temperature and chemical environment. Experiments have been performed on loose sands\n8\n\n,\n\n33\n\n,\n\n36\n\n,\n\n37\n\n,\n\n45\u201348\n and sandstones.\n28\n\n,\n\n29\n\n,\n\n35\n\n,\n\n49\u201361\n However, most studies to date have employed either air dry samples\n8\n\n,\n\n33\n\n,\n\n36\n\n,\n\n37\n\n,\n\n45\n\n,\n\n48\n or samples with water as pore fluid,\n8\n\n,\n\n28\n\n,\n\n29\n\n,\n\n35\u201337\n\n,\n\n45\u201361\n leaving the effects of other chemically active fluid compositions, particularly on sandstone deformation behaviour, poorly explored.\n8\n\n,\n\n37\n\n,\n\n45\n\n,\n\n48\n Moreover, creep experiments on sandstones under varying chemical conditions are few and rarely conducted under zero lateral strain conditions expected in situ.\n62\n\n\nTo contribute to this latter knowledge gap, we conducted compaction creep experiments on clean, quartz-rich, Bentheim sandstone in a uniaxial compaction vessel (oedometer), imposing zero lateral strain conditions, using tightly fitting samples jacketed in a thin polymer sleeve. A range of pore fluids, including dry and wet supercritical \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2, and aqueous solutions, were employed to investigate the effect of chemical environment on compaction creep under drained conditions. The chemical environments were selected based on a previous study investigating the impact of fluids on compaction of loose quartz sand.\n8\n The experiments were performed at a typical reservoir temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C (i.e.\u00a02\u20134\u00a0km depth, assuming a geothermal gradient of 20\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C\/km), and at constant axial effective stresses of 35, 75 and 100 MPa. The experiments showed that 1-D compaction creep is strongly influenced by pore fluid chemistry, increasing with the activity of water and\/or the pH of the fluid moving from dry and wet supercritical fluids to low-vacuum (dry) conditions to acidic aqueous solutions to distilled water. Acoustic emission data and microstructural analysis revealed that microcracking was the dominant deformation mechanism. The results imply that injection into quartz-rich reservoirs of fluids devoid of water or characterised by low water content, and acidic fluids would decrease reservoir compaction rates.\n\n\n2\nExperimental method\n\n2.1\nSample and pore fluid preparation\nCylindrical samples were cored from outcrop blocks of Bentheim sandstone, retrieved from the Gildenhausen quarry near the village of Bentheim, Germany. This sandstone was selected as it has been extensively studied and is well-known for its relatively homogeneous composition, consisting mainly of quartz grains and quartz cement.\n55\n\n,\n\n63\u201377\n No bedding was apparent in either the starting blocks or the cored samples. The cores were 19.6\u00a0mm in diameter and approximately 50\u00a0mm in length. The porosity of all cores was determined using gravimetric methods, by weighing the samples dry and saturated with water. Together with the core dimensions, this yielded porosities of 21.8\u201323.3% (Table\u00a01). After porosity determination, the cores were cut into shorter cylindrical plugs of approximately 10\u00a0mm length. The ends of each plug were ground flat and perpendicular to the sample axis.\n\nIn total, 14 uniaxial creep experiments were performed on such plugs, whereby three control experiments were done under low-vacuum (dry) conditions. In addition, eight different chemical environments were employed to investigate the effect of chemical environment on compaction creep (Table\u00a01). Four supercritical phases were employed at a fluid pressure (\n\n\nP\n\n\np\n\n\n) of 10 MPa, including \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n (purity \n\u2265\n 99.999 vol %), CO2 (purity \n\u2265\n 99.7 vol %), water-saturated-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n (wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n), and water-saturated-CO2 (wet-CO2). In addition, two \u2018simple\u2019 aqueous solutions (HCl solution of pH 3.7 and distilled water) and two \u2018complex\u2019 solutions were used, at atmospheric pressure. The complex solutions consisted of a widely used scaling inhibitor solution containing 0.004 M AMP (amino trimethylene phosphonic acid; pH 2.5) and a 0.01 M AlCl 3 solution (pH 2.8).\nLow-vacuum (dry) conditions were obtained by evacuating the sample within the oedometer compaction vessel before and during mechanical testing, using a single-stage rotary vacuum pump (Fig.\u00a01a). Dry supercritical fluids were prepared by filling an ISCO pump (total volume 68 mL) with pure \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n or CO2. These were then pre-pressurised to 9 MPa using a diaphragm pump (Fig.\u00a01a). The externally heated ISCO pump was then used to achieve further pressurisation to 10\u00a0MPa at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, resulting in supercritical conditions.\n78\n Wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n or wet-CO2 phases were prepared by filling the ISCO pump with a small volume of water (10 mL) and filling the remaining volume with pure \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n or CO2, respectively. The mixture was then pre-pressurised to 9 MPa using the diaphragm pump and further pressurisation to 10 MPa was achieved using the ISCO pump, while heating to 60\u00a0\u00b0C. This procedure yielded a maximum water concentration at 60\u00a0\u00b0C of 9.1 mol of water\/m3 for the wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and 33.8 mol\/m3 for the wet-CO2 (see Refs.\u00a08, 78\u201380). All supercritical fluids were prepared at 60\u00a0\u00b0C as opposed to the experimental conditions of 80\u00a0\u00b0C to protect the seals of the ISCO pump and prevent condensation of water in the wet phases upon injection into the sample. Prior to injection into the sample, the fluids were left to equilibrate overnight.\n\nThe HCl solution of pH 3.7 was prepared by diluting a fixed quantity of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in distilled water. The 0.004 M AMP solution was prepared by diluting 1\u00a0\u2030 AMP solution with 1 L of distilled water and for the 0.01\u00a0M AlCl 3 solution, 2.4143\u00a0g of aluminium chloride salt was dissolved in 1\u00a0L of distilled water. All of these acidic aqueous solutions were stirred for approximately 5 mins and left to equilibrate for at least 5 days prior to use. After equilibration, each solution was heated to 80\u00a0\u00b0C before measuring solution pH using a portable pH meter (Oakton Instruments) that accounts for the temperature-dependence of pH.\n\n\n2.2\nExperimental set-up and acoustic monitoring system\nThe sandstone compaction experiments were performed in a uniaxial (1-D) compaction vessel (oedometer), secured in an Instron\u00a08862 servo-controlled loading frame (Fig.\u00a01b and c). The compaction vessel is modified from the vessel originally described by Ref.\u00a039. This vessel was previously used for compaction experiments on loose granular material.\n8\n\n,\n\n36\n\n,\n\n37\n\n,\n\n45\n\n,\n\n48\n In the present study, the vessel was employed for uniaxial compaction testing of tight-fitting sandstone plugs (prepared as described above) jacketed in a thin polymer sleeve, under zero radial strain boundary conditions. The radial (effective) stress was accordingly (near) zero at zero axial load, increasing with loading but unmeasured.\nThe vessel and loading pistons are constructed from corrosion resistant Monel K-500, a copper\u2013nickel\u2013molybdenum alloy. The top piston contains a pore fluid bore, allowing both evacuation of the sample and injection of a pore fluid. A 1\u00a0mm thick, porous, stainless steel plate between the top piston and sample ensures even distribution of fluid over the sample cross-sectional area upon fluid injection. In addition, it prevents loose sandstone grains from entering and clogging the pore fluid bore. Both the top and bottom piston are sealed against the vessel wall using EPDM O-rings.\nAxial force, displacement and temperature are controlled and measured throughout the experiment. Force is applied by advancing the Instron loading ram. It is measured externally using the Instron load cell (0\u2013100\u00a0kN range, resolution \n\u00b1\n\u00a00.05\u00a0kN). In addition, force is measured with an internal load cell (0\u2013100\u00a0kN range, resolution \n\u00b1\n\u00a00.05\u00a0kN) located in the top part of the bottom piston. Piston position and displacement are measured using a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) located in the Instron drive unit (\n\u00b1\n\u00a050\u00a0mm range, resolution \n\u00b1\n\u00a00.\n\n25\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n) and a Sangamo LVDT (\n\u00b1\n\u00a01\u00a0mm range, resolution \n\u00b1\n\u00a00.\n\n1\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n) located between the upper piston and the vessel (Fig.\u00a01c). A furnace allows controlled heating of the sample with \n\u00b1\n\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C accuracy using a K-type chromel-alumel control thermocouple. This thermocouple is positioned within the furnace windings and connected to a proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) controller. A second K-type thermocouple, embedded in the vessel wall adjacent to the sample, independently measures sample temperature.\nIn addition, the experimental set-up is equipped with an acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system that detects and counts AEs produced by the compacting sample.\n8\n The AE events are detected using a ceramic piezoelectric resonator, mounted externally on the top piston (Fig.\u00a01c). The resulting signal passes through a precision preamplifier (36\u00a0dB gain) and a multistage signal conditioning system (24\u00a0dB gain). A 100\u00a0kHz to 1\u00a0MHz band-pass filter is applied to eliminate low frequency interference and sensor resonance effects. Lastly, a two-counter channel with a constant trigger-threshold of 200\u00a0mV, which is just above the noise level, discriminates and counts the incoming AE events. Pulse stretching times (PST) of 1000\u00a0\n\u03bc\ns and 500\u00a0\n\u03bc\ns are set for each counter, to check for wave pocket arrival-bouncing effects and counter saturation. In case of discrete events, the count rates from the two channels should be identical.\nSample evacuation and fluid introduction are achieved via the pore fluid system (Fig.\u00a01a). This consists of a vacuum pump, Drechsel bottle, ISCO pump, diaphragm pump, and sources of compressed air (0.8 MPa), \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2 (bottle pressures of 20 and 5.7 MPa, respectively). The vacuum pump is connected to the sample via the Drechsel bottle for evacuation of the sample. The diaphragm pump is used for pre-pressurising the fluids in the ISCO pump at 9\u00a0MPa. The ISCO pump is used to achieve further pressurisation to 10\u00a0MPa, while heating to 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Via the combination of valves shown in Fig.\u00a01, the sample can be directly connected to the ISCO pump to inject fluids prepared in the ISCO pump. Alternatively, the sample can be connected to the Drechsel bottle for vacuum-flooding with aqueous solutions. Pore fluid pressure is controlled at 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 MPa using the ISCO pump.\n\n\n2.3\nExperimental procedure\n\n2.3.1\nControl experiments\nPrior to the sandstone experiments with different chemical environments, a series of experiments was conducted to test whether the tight-fitting samples would be effectively constrained to (near) zero radial strain. In these control experiments, we deformed two aluminium samples with known elastic properties, as well as two Bentheim sandstone samples, under radially unconstrained (no jacket) and radially constrained (with tight-fitting jacket) conditions, at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. The aim was to compare the constrained and unconstrained elastic stiffness parameters for aluminium and Bentheim sandstone to measured values. Theoretically, the axial stiffness of an unconstrained sample is represented by the Young\u2019s modulus (\nE\n). By contrast, for a fully constrained sample, the stiffness is represented by the constrained modulus (\nM\n), which can be calculated using the Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio (\n\u03bd\n) using the relation \n\n(1)\n\n\nM\n=\n\n\nE\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor aluminium, the Young\u2019s modulus ranges from 68 to 70 GPa and the Poisson\u2019s ratio from 0.33 to 0.346,\n81\u201383\n yielding an \nM\n value in the range 101 to 110 GPa. For Bentheim sandstone, the Young\u2019s modulus lies in the range 8.9 to 14.7 GPa, while the Poisson\u2019s ratio is reported to be 0.13\u20130.36,\n65\n\n,\n\n67\n\n,\n\n75\n which would give \n\nM\n=\n9\n.\n3\n\n to 17.6 GPa.\nFor the unconstrained test on Bentheim sandstone, the sample was used as prepared, i.e.\u00a0we used an unjacketed plug, 10\u00a0mm in length and 19.6\u00a0mm in diameter, which is slightly smaller than the 20\u00a0mm diameter vessel chamber. The aluminium sample used in the unconstrained test on this material was unjacketed and 19.5\u00a0mm in diameter and also 10\u00a0mm in length. This sample was slightly smaller in diameter to compensate for the larger coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminium (\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\naluminium\n\n\n = 23 \n\u22c5\n 10\u22126\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC\u22121; Ref.\u00a081) compared to sandstone (\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nBentheim\n\n\n=\n10\n\n.9 \n\u22c5\n 10\u22126\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC\u22121; Ref.\u00a066), ensuring the sample remained unconstrained during heating to 80\u00a0\u00b0C. For the constrained tests, a 19.6 \n\u00d7\n 10mm Bentheim plug was used as prepared, along with an aluminium sample of the same dimension. Both samples were jacketed with a fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), heat shrink sleeve of \n\n200\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n thickness to make the sample fit exactly in the vessel. The FEP-sleeve, with a coefficient of thermal expansion (\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nFEP\n\n\n) of 135 \n\u22c5\n 10\u22126\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC\u22121, compensated for the differential thermal expansion between the aluminium dummy sample or Bentheim sandstone sample and the compaction vessel (\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nMonel\n\n\n=\n13\n\n.7 \n\u22c5\n 10\u22126\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC\u22121) during heating to 80\u00a0\u00b0C, ensuring continued tightfitting of the sample in the vessel. Before testing, the jackets were sprayed with Molykote D-312R, to reduce friction between the sample and the vessel wall, and the spray was allowed to dry for at least one hour.\nPrior to inserting the sample into the compaction vessel, the vessel was mounted on its lower piston. A 10\u00a0mm high stainless steel spacer was emplaced in the vessel to position the sample in the centre of the vessel, and the (un)jacketed sample and porous steel plate inserted. The furnace and top piston were subsequently added and the entire assembly located in the Instron loading frame.\n\n\n2.3.2\nExperiments on constrained sandstone samples using different chemical environments\nIn preparation for each experiment, the sample was jacketed in a FEP sleeve and located into the 1-D compaction vessel and Instron loading frame as described above. The compaction vessel was then heated to the target temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C in approximately 2 h, while simultaneously evacuating the sample assembly. After reaching the target temperature, a small stress of 0.3 MPa (equivalent to a load of 0.1 kN) was applied to the sample. In the case of the low-vacuum (dry) experiments, a loading ramp was applied with a constant stress rate of 5 MPa\/min, corresponding to loading strain rates in the range 1.5 \n\u22c5\n 10\u22125 to 2.0 \n\u22c5\n 10\u22125 s\u22121, to attain a constant applied stress of 35, 75 or 100 MPa (Table\u00a01).\nA slightly different approach was used for the experiments employing a high-pressure pore fluid. After insertion of the sample and installation of the apparatus in the Instron frame, a 3\u00a0mm gap was created between the upper piston spacing block and the Instron load cell (see Fig.\u00a01). Then, the pressurised fluid (\n\n\n\nP\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n10\n\nMPa\n\n) was introduced. After pore pressure stabilisation (1\u20132 mins), the top piston was slowly advanced (1\u00a0mm\/min) to apply a small load to the sample (touch position). During slow piston advancement to this position, dynamic seal friction was determined in the presence of the high-pressure fluid, being 0.4\u20130.8\u00a0MPa. Subsequently, a loading ramp of 5 MPa\/min was initiated to increase the applied stress to 110.4\u2013110.8\u00a0MPa, such that the effective stress on the sample was 100 MPa.\nSamples tested with aqueous pore fluids at atmospheric conditions were first vacuum-flooded with the pore fluid, at a small applied stress of 0.3 MPa. The pore fluid pressure was maintained at atmospheric pressure by drainage to air. After flooding, the applied stress was increased to 75 or 100 MPa (Table\u00a01) at 5 MPa\/min. In all experiments, the creep phase was taken to commence at the moment the final constant stress was reached on the sample.\nThe creep phase lasted up to 94 h, after which each test was terminated (see Table\u00a01). Experiments performed at low-vacuum (dry) conditions were completely unloaded at 5 MPa\/min, followed by removal of the vacuum. Samples saturated with pressurised fluids were first unloaded (5 MPa\/min) to their original touch position, and after removing the pore pressure, the samples were fully unloaded. Vacuum-saturated samples were fully unloaded at a rate of 5 MPa\/min, maintaining drainage to atmospheric pressure. After unloading, the furnace was switched off and the samples were left to cool to room temperature. Finally, the assembly was removed from the Instron loading frame and the samples were carefully extracted. Wet samples were placed in an oven at 50\u00a0\u00b0C to dry for a minimum of five days prior to preparation for microstructural analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\nData acquisition and processing\nThroughout each experiment, external Instron load, internal load, Instron LVDT position, Sangamo LVDT position, sample temperature and cumulative acoustic emission count were logged at an interval of one second. Applied axial stress and effective axial stress were calculated from the external Instron load and internal load data, using pore fluid pressure data where relevant. Friction between the top piston seal and vessel wall was considered negligible for all experiments (< 0.8 MPa\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see above). However, comparison of external and internal load cell data indicated measurable sample-vessel wall friction. The difference between the external and internal stress was smallest in the experiments conducted with pressurised pore fluids, e.g.\u00a0at 100 MPa effective stress, the stress measured by the internal load cell varying between 99.4 and 102.4 MPa. For experiments conducted at low-vacuum (dry) conditions or with aqueous solutions at atmospheric pressures, the internal axial stress measured between 94.5 and 98.4 MPa at 100 MPa applied stress. Taking the sample stress as the average of the internally and externally measured stress yields an average (effective) sample stress of 101.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 MPa for samples employing pressurised pore fluids, and 98.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 MPa for dry and vacuum-saturated samples. On this basis, sample-vessel wall friction is assumed to be < 2.6% of the applied effective stress in all cases.\nSample length was measured prior to testing using a calliper, as well as by comparing the Instron LVDT position to an empty vessel reference point. Though both approaches yielded similar results, the latter was preferred as this allowed calculation of the instantaneous sample length. Both the Instron LVDT position and the Sangamo LVDT displacement data were corrected for elastic machine distortion using a predefined, eighth-order polynomial function determined from machine calibrations on the experimental set-up without a sample. In addition, the time and Sangamo LVDT displacement data was time-averaged over a window of 60 s to reduce noise in the data. From the corrected and averaged displacement data, instantaneous volumetric strain, defined as \n\n\n\ne\n\n\nv\n\n\n\u2248\n\u2212\n\u0394\nL\n\/\n\n\nL\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n, was calculated, where \n\n\nL\n\n\n0\n\n\n is the length of the sample at the start of the loading or creep phase and \n\n\u0394\nL\n\n is the change in sample length at any subsequent instant. The corrected and averaged time and displacement data measured during the creep phase were used to calculate instantaneous strain rates defined as \n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\/\nL\n\n\n\n\nd\nL\n\/\nd\nt\n\n\n\n. The strain rates were calculated by performing a least-squares inversion over a variable time window centred around each individual displacement data point. The window size was based on a set displacement tolerance of 4\u00a0\n\u03bc\nm. Though this method allowed for accurate determination of both high and low strain rates, large errors were found towards the end of several experiments when the displacement resolution (\n\u00b1\n0.\n\n1\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n) of the Sangamo LVDT was reached. Therefore, strain rates with an error of more than 1.5% and\/or rates below 10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n8.0\n\n\n s\u22121 were excluded from further analysis. Similarly, instantaneous AE rates were calculated from the cumulative AE count data, with the tolerance for the AE window size set to 200\u00a0AE events.\nIn addition, the axial sample stiffness during loading was evaluated for each sample. The characteristic sample stiffness is defined as the slope of the linear part of the stress\u2013strain curve during loading, determined via linear least-squares regression. In the current experiments, the stress\u2013strain curve was nonlinear at stresses below 30 MPa, and hence the characteristic sample stiffness was determined for higher stresses (see Fig.\u00a02a and c).\n\n\n2.5\nAnalytical and microstructural methods\nAfter drying, all samples, except dry01, CO202 and AMP01, were impregnated with a low-viscosity, blue-dyed (Oil Blue organic dye, DuPont), epoxy resin (Araldite 2020) for microstructural analysis. Thin sections (\n\u223c\n30 \n\u03bc\nm thick) were cut parallel to the loading axis and analysed using transmitted light microscopy. The blue-dyed resin resulted in a clear distinction between pores and grains. Micrograph mosaics (50 \n\u00d7\n magnification; 9 by 18\u00a0mm) covering the entire thin section were obtained to qualitatively investigate the grain-scale mechanisms controlling deformation.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nControl experiments on unconstrained vs. constrained samples\nThe results of our control experiments performed on aluminium and sandstone samples to investigate if the FEP-sleeve approach would effectively constrain tight-fitting samples to (near) zero radial strain are shown in Fig.\u00a02. In both the constrained and unconstrained experiments using aluminium dummies, the samples were loaded and unloaded in six cycles up to a maximum applied axial stress of 55 MPa under lab dry conditions at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. Both samples showed a highly compliant, non-linear stress\u2013strain response (Fig.\u00a02a) up to \n\u223c\n10 MPa, followed by rapid stiffening in the range 10\u201320\u00a0MPa. This likely reflects stiffening of the machine related to increased alignment at higher stresses. Above 30 MPa (dashed horizontal line in Fig.\u00a02a), the stress\u2013strain response approached linear behaviour, which enabled us to determine the characteristic stiffness of the dummy samples for each stress-cycle in the range 30\u201355\u00a0MPa. This varied over the six stress-cycles applied (Fig.\u00a02b), with the unconstrained and constrained aluminium sample showing a stiffness of approximately 70\u00a0GPa and 144 GPa, respectively.\nThe results obtained in the unconstrained and constrained control tests performed using Bentheim sandstone at low-vacuum (dry) conditions and 80\u00a0\u00b0C are shown in Fig.\u00a02c and d. Only one loading cycle was applied in these runs. For reference, the loading data of experiment dry02 is added to these figures, because it had the same starting porosity and was conducted under the same conditions. Overall, the stress\u2013strain behaviour of the sandstone samples showed similar characteristics to the aluminium dummy at axial stresses up to \n\u223c\n60 MPa, with the exception that the stiffness was much lower. Between 30 and 60 MPa (dashed horizontal lines in Fig.\u00a02c), the stress\u2013strain response of the unconstrained and constrained samples approached linear behaviour, such that the characteristic stiffness of the sandstone samples could be determined in the range 30\u201360\u00a0MPa. The characteristic stiffness of the unconstrained sandstone samples was 7.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0 GPa, while the constrained samples had higher stiffness values of 10.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0 GPa (loadunload) and 7.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 GPa (dry02, see Table\u00a01). As can be seen, the unconstrained sample (grey line in Fig.\u00a02c) failed at approximately 62 MPa applied stress, indicated by the rapid increase in strain and deviation from linearity of the stress\u2013strain curve. This was accompanied by a surge in AE activity (Fig.\u00a02d). The FEP-constrained sandstone sample did not show this type of behaviour, as evidenced by the much lower AE count (16,000 AE counts versus 65,000 AE counts when unconstrained).\n\n\n3.2\nDeformation of constrained sandstone samples during loading\nFor the active loading phase of the experiments, the strain versus applied axial stress behaviour observed for the constrained samples exposed to different chemical environments is similar to that observed in the control experiments (Fig.\u00a03a and b; cf. Section\u00a03.1). Most experiments fall in the strain range of 1.8\u20132.4% at the end of the loading stage, with the exception of experiments dry01, dry02, DI01, CO203 and AMP01, which all showed strains approximately 0.5% higher. The experiments employing supercritical fluids generally showed a more rapid increase in strain for the first few MPa of stress applied to the sample. There does not appear to be a systematic effect of fluid on the strain achieved during loading though it is noteworthy that, in the low-vacuum (dry) experiments, the onset of audible AEs is evident at much lower applied stresses than in the fluid-saturated experiments (see Fig.\u00a03c and d).\n\n\nThe characteristic stiffness of each sample was determined from a linear fit to the stress\u2013strain data in the applied effective stress range 30 to 60 MPa and yielded values between 6.0 and 10.6 GPa. Note that experiment dry01 was excluded from this analysis, because it was only loaded to 35 MPa. The stiffness appeared to be independent of water concentration (Fig.\u00a03e) and fluid pH (Fig.\u00a03f). By contrast, sample porosity, despite falling in a narrow range of 21.8\u201323.3%, appeared to impact the amount of total strain obtained during loading, with the higher porosity samples CO202 (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n22\n.\n5\n%\n\n) and AMP01 (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n23\n.\n3\n%\n\n) being more compliant, with characteristic stiffness of 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 and 6.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0 GPa, than their lower porosity counterparts CO203 (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n21\n.\n8\n%\n\n) and AMP02 (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n22\n.\n4\n%\n\n) with stiffness values of 10.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 and 8.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 GPa, respectively (see Fig.\u00a03e and f).\n\n\n3.3\nCompaction creep at different applied stresses and low-vacuum (dry) vs. wet conditions\nThe compaction creep data obtained for the sandstone samples after loading to a constant applied (effective) stress of 35, 75 and 100 MPa at low-vacuum (dry) conditions, and 75 and 100 MPa applied stress at fluid-saturated (distilled water) conditions are presented in Fig.\u00a04. All experiments showed rapid accumulation of strain in the first few minutes after attaining the creep testing stress, followed by ongoing deformation at decreasing strain rates (Fig.\u00a04a and c). The AE data showed a similar response versus time and strain (c.f. Fig.\u00a04a and b, and Fig.\u00a04c and d). Note that for an applied stress of 35 MPa under dry conditions, almost no strain and no AE counts were accumulated during the creep phase, excluding reliable calculation of strain rate and AE rate.\nAs expected, creep strains and cumulative AE count increased with increasing applied stress (Fig.\u00a04a and b). After 40 h of compaction at low-vacuum (dry) conditions, the total creep strain amounted to 0.02, 0.09 and 0.2% at 35, 75 and 100 MPa applied stress, respectively (Fig.\u00a04a). A similar trend was observed in the AE counts, with almost no AEs counted at 35 MPa applied stress, and approximately 2,200 and 9,500 AEs counted at 75 and 100 MPa applied stress, respectively (Fig.\u00a04b).\nFurthermore, at given applied stress, more creep strain and AEs were measured in samples saturated with distilled water compared to dry conditions (Fig.\u00a04a and b). After 40 h under distilled water conditions, creep strain was roughly double the strain measured under dry conditions, amounting to 0.17 and 0.41% at 75 and 100 MPa applied stress, respectively (Fig.\u00a04a). This increase in strain was also reflected in the cumulative AE data, with 3.5 times more AEs counted during wet creep, i.e.\u00a0approximately 7,800 and 33,300 counts at 75 and 100 MPa applied stress, respectively (Fig.\u00a04b).\nSimilarly, strain rates increased with applied stress and saturation of the sample with distilled water, and, for all samples, creep strain rates decreased with accumulating strain (Fig.\u00a04c). At 75 MPa applied stress, initial strain rates were roughly similar (10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n.\n6\n\n\n-10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n.\n5\n\n\n s\u22121) for the dry and wet sample, but as compaction increased, creep under dry conditions slowed down more rapidly with strain, compared to fluid-saturated conditions. By contrast, at 100 MPa applied stress, initial strain rates were higher under fluid-saturated conditions compared to the dry environment, measuring 10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n.\n0\n\n\n and 10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n.\n6\n\n\n s\u22121 for the dry and distilled water sample, respectively. This behaviour was also reflected in the AE rate data (Fig.\u00a04d), with higher AE count rates being measured at larger applied stress and under distilled water-saturated conditions (Fig.\u00a04d). Initially, i.e.\u00a0up to 0.03% strain (10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n3\n.\n55\n\n\n), the 75 MPa distilled water experiment showed a slightly lower AE count rate (10\n\n\n\n0\n.\n4\n\n\n s\u22121) and strain rate than the 75 MPa dry experiment. At 100 MPa applied stress, AE rates of 101.4 and 10\n\n\n\n1\n.\n8\n\n\n s\u22121 were measured in the dry and wet sample, respectively, in line with the higher strain rates obtained for the distilled water-saturated samples (cf. Fig.\u00a04c). Interestingly, the decrease in strain rate and AE rate with strain seen in the dry experiments appeared to be more rapid than for the fluid-saturated experiments.\n\n\nThe close correlation between strain and AE count is explicitly shown in Fig.\u00a05, where cumulative AE count and AE rate are plotted as a function of strain and strain rate, respectively. A linear relation between AE count and strain was observed for all applied stresses in both the low-vacuum (dry) and distilled water-saturated conditions (Fig.\u00a05a). In addition, AE rate showed a linear dependency on strain rate, which can be approximated by a slope of 1 for all dry and distilled water-saturated samples (Fig.\u00a05b).\nIn short, our experiments indicated that creep strain, AE count, creep rates and AE rates strongly increased with increasing applied stress, and with the addition of distilled water. Creep and AE rates were approximately one order of magnitude faster at 100 MPa applied stress than at 75 MPa (Fig.\u00a04c and d).\n\n\n3.4\nCompaction creep in different chemical environments\n\n3.4.1\nCompaction creep in supercritical fluids\nBentheim sandstone samples saturated with supercritical fluids at 10 MPa pore pressure (\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n, wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n, CO2 and wet-CO2) showed compaction creep behaviour similar to that observed for dry and water-saturated samples, with an initial rapid increase in strain, followed by a slowing down of the creep rate (Fig.\u00a06). Note that the sudden increase in strain and strain rate around 25 h in the wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n experiment was caused by ingress of distilled water due to a leaking pore fluid system. AE data was not recorded in the wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and wet-CO2 experiment due to technical issues.\nIt can be noted that samples saturated with supercritical fluids displayed less creep strain and fewer AEs than samples loaded under dry conditions. In addition, a small effect of sample porosity was observed, with creep strain and AEs increasing with porosity (cf. CO202 and CO203). Focusing on the samples with a porosity of 22.2\u201322.5%, after 20 h of creep, the samples saturated with wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n, CO2 and wet-CO2 displayed similar amounts of creep strain, ranging from 0.11 to 0.13% (Fig.\u00a06a), which was less than the amount of strain measured for the dry sample (0.18%). Note that for similar sample porosities there is no significant difference in the strain accumulated in the presence of wet-CO2 compared to wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n. For samples with a slightly lower porosity (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n21\n.\n8\n%\n\n), saturation with CO2 produced less creep strain (CO203; 0.08%) than saturation with \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n (0.12% strain). The observed strain-time behaviour in response to different chemical environments was also reflected in the cumulative AE data (Fig.\u00a06b). While almost 9,000 AE counts were registered in the dry sample at 20 h, 3,000 AEs were measured in the higher porosity CO2 experiment (CO202), and 3,500 and a little over 1,000 AEs in the lower porosity \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2-saturated samples (CO203).\nStrain rates and AE rates in samples saturated with supercritical fluids were lower overall than the rates measured for a dry environment (Fig.\u00a06c and d). Initial strain rates ranged from 10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n.\n8\n\n\n to 10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n.\n0\n\n\n s\u22121 and decreased as creep strain accumulated. For the slightly lower porosity samples (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n21\n.\n8\n%\n\n), the reduction in strain rate with strain appeared to be more rapid than for the more porous samples (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n22\n\n.2\u201322.5%), i.e.\u00a0a strain exponent of \u22124.2 to \u22125.6 s\u22121 compared to \u22122.6 to \u22123.4 s\u22121. AE rates in all experiments decreased from initial values of approximately 101 s\u22121 to final values at test termination of 10\u22122 s\u22121 (Fig.\u00a06d). Though overall AE rate was highest in the dry experiments, it displayed the most rapid reduction with increasing strain. The lowest reduction in AE rate with strain was observed for the high porosity CO2-saturated sample (CO202). The low porosity \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2-saturated (CO203) samples displayed an intermediate reduction in AE rate with increasing strain.\nOverall, the presence of supercritical fluids caused less compaction and slower creep rates than seen under dry conditions (Fig.\u00a06). It should be noted, the compaction behaviour significantly changed in experiment wN201, where, after 25 h of creep, water leaked into the sample. This led to a marked increase in strain and strain rate (Fig.\u00a06a and c). After the initial surge in strain rate upon water ingress, the strain rate decayed to rates similar to before after approximately 0.2% of strain. This behaviour is in accordance with that observed when comparing individual dry and water-saturated experiments (cf. Section\u00a03.3).\n\n\n3.4.2\nCompaction creep in acidic aqueous solutions\nSamples flooded with acidic aqueous solutions (pH 3.7 HCl solution, pH 2.5 AMP solution, pH 2.8 AlCl 3 solution) displayed typical compaction creep behaviour similar to that exhibited by the dry, distilled water-saturated and supercritical fluid-saturated samples (Fig.\u00a07). In the porosity range 22.2\u201322.4%, samples saturated with acidic solutions showed less creep strain and fewer accumulated AEs, and lower creep strain rates and AE rates than the sample tested with distilled water at 100 MPa stress (Fig.\u00a07). However, the introduction of acidic fluid still led to more deformation compared to the vacuum-dry environment.\n\n\nAfter 40 h of compaction and focusing on the experiments in the porosity range 22.2\u201322.4%, the lowest creep strain was measured in the AlCl3 solution experiment (0.22%), while the AMP solution-saturated sample exhibited 0.28% strain. Overall, less creep strain was produced in the acidic environments compared to distilled water (0.41% strain). This influence of chemical environment was also reflected in the strain rate data. Initial creep strain rates were between 10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n.\n0\n\n\n and 10\n\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n.\n6\n\n\n s\u22121, and reduced with ongoing creep (Fig.\u00a07c). The decrease in strain rate was faster in the acidic environments (strain exponent of \u22123.9 and \u22124.3 s\u22121 for AMP02 and AlCl301, respectively) than in the dry (strain exponent of \u22123.4 s\u22121), and the water-saturated environments (strain exponent of \u22122.8 s\u22121).\nBesides the effect of chemical environment, porosity played a role in controlling the amount of strain and the strain rate. In accordance with previous observations (cf. N202 and CO203), this is illustrated by experiments 3HCl01 (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n21\n.\n8\n%\n\n) and AMP01 (\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n23\n.\n3\n%\n\n), which employed samples with the lowest and highest porosity of the batch, respectively. The sample saturated with pH 3.7 HCl solution (3HCl01) produced the smallest amount of creep strain (Fig.\u00a07a), while the strain measured for the more porous AMP01 sample was almost double (0.51%) compared to its 22.4% porosity equivalent (AMP02; Fig.\u00a07a). The influence of porosity is also reflected in the strain rate data, as evidence by lower and higher strain rates for 3HCl01 and AMP01, respectively, compared to the samples in the porosity range 22.2\u201322.4% (Fig.\u00a07c).\nUnfortunately, a problem with the AE sensor was noted after the experiments with acidic aqueous solutions were conducted, suggesting that the AE counts may have been impeded due to insufficient contact of the piezoelectric resonator with the vessel. This may explain why the cumulative AE counts recorded in the experiments conducted with acidic aqueous solutions were lower than expected based on the creep strain data and compared with the number of AEs recorded in the dry and wet reference experiments (Fig.\u00a07b\u00a0\u2013\u00a0note that for these experiments the curves are lighter shaded). However, the AE data qualitatively matched the trends observed in the strain data, i.e.\u00a0the highest number of AEs were seen in the higher porosity AMP solution-flooded sample, intermediate values were obtained for the lower porosity AMP solution experiment and AlCl 3-saturated sample, and the lowest number of AE\u2019s was obtained in the pH 3.7 HCl solution experiment. In summary, the mechanical and AE data show the same trends, in that flooding of the Bentheim sandstone with acidic aqueous solution (HCl, AMP, AlCl 3 solution) inhibited compaction creep and creep strain rates (Fig.\u00a07), compared to distilled water.\n\n\n\n3.5\nMicrostructural data\nA single undeformed Bentheim sandstone sample was analysed using optical microscopy. Manual counting of the grains confirmed that 95% of the grains consisted of quartz. The remaining grains consisted of corroded feldspar (\n\u223c\n4%), partly altered to clay minerals. Primary clay minerals were also present and lined the pores in some areas (< 1%). The quartz grains were rounded to subrounded and ranged from 70 to 450 \n\u03bc\nm in diameter, with a mean grain size of 180\u2013250 \n\u03bc\nm. Grain contacts generally appeared be (near-)point contacts (e.g.\u00a0seen on right off centre in Fig.\u00a08a), though to sutured, flattened contacts were also present (e.g.\u00a0top left in Fig.\u00a08a). Furthermore, the quartz grains contained fluid inclusions and occasionally pre-existing cracks, presumably resulting from its burial and diagenetic history (Fig.\u00a08a). No bedding, laminations or grain sorting were visible.\nOne sample was loaded to 100 MPa and then directly unloaded (loadunload\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see Table\u00a01). Throughout this sample, more cracks were observed than in the undeformed sample (cf. Fig.\u00a08a and b), however, cracks were not as abundant as seen in the samples that were also allowed to creep at constant stress (see Fig.\u00a08c\u2013g). Most cracks emanated from grain-to-grain contacts, both within grains (intergranular cracks, Fig.\u00a08a\u2013f), across grains (transgranular cracks, Fig.\u00a08d\u2013g), and along grain boundaries producing grain boundary breakage (Fig.\u00a08c and f). Generally, cracks were oriented parallel or subparallel to the loading direction and not specifically related to the grain composition (quartz vs. feldspar). Though cracks were observed throughout the entire cross section of each sample, clusters of more severely damaged grains were also observed in samples AlCl301, AMP02, DI01, DI02 and wN201. These damage zones were a few grains wide and typically contained a large portion of crushed grains, in addition to cracked grains (Fig.\u00a08e and f). These clusters of crushed grains formed circular patches and did not extend laterally to form bands.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nDeformation mechanisms responsible for compaction creep\nWe observed that creep was enhanced by increasing applied stress and by saturating the sample with distilled water or aqueous solutions. Together with (a) the AE activity observed during creep (Figs. 4, 6 and 7), (b) the linear relation observed between AE rate and strain rate, which was characterised by a slope of 1 (Fig.\u00a05b), and (c) microstructural analysis, which showed an abundance of new cracks in the quartz grains post-creep deformation, it is inferred that compaction creep was accommodated by microcracking in quartz grains and breakage of cemented grain contacts with serial rearrangement of grains and grain fragments. Alternative deformation mechanisms include mass transfer processes such as dissolution of grains or of microscale asperities within grain contacts, or else pressure solution at grain contacts.\n40\n\n,\n\n42\n\n,\n\n84\n However, given the short duration of our experiments (less than 4 days), the relatively low temperature of the tests, the slow kinetics of these processes,\n42\n plus the lack of dissolution features in our deformed samples, we believe that any contribution of dissolution\u2013precipitation mechanisms to deformation was likely negligible.\n\nThe cracks radiating from grain contacts in the quartz grains (Fig.\u00a08) are typically referred to as Hertzian contact fractures.\n37\n\n,\n\n85\n\n,\n\n86\n These fracture develop at the edge of grain-to-grain contacts, where tensile stresses are largest (Hertzian contact theory\n87\n; see also Ref.\u00a088). When a sample containing pre-existing flaws or cracks at grain surfaces is loaded, these cracks will propagate either in equilibrium Griffith mode or in a sub-critical time-dependent manner.\n89\n\n,\n\n90\n Equilibrium crack growth (Griffith criterion) occurs if the strain energy release rate \nG\n can provide the energy needed to form fracture surfaces, i.e.\u00a0when \n\nG\n=\n\n\nG\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n2\n\u03b3\n\n, where \n\u03b3\n is the (effective) surface energy per unit area [J m\u22122] and \n\n\nG\n\n\nc\n\n\n is the critical value of \nG\n, the fracture energy.

These trends are in line with our observations (Figs.\u00a04 to 6), further supporting our inference that microcracking is the key mechanism controlling creep in our experiments.\n\n4.1.1\nThe influence of applied stress and porosity on compaction creep\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a04, creep strain, AE count, creep rates and AE rates strongly increase with increasing applied stress. At higher applied stresses, the stresses acting across grain-to-grain contacts are larger, in turn enhancing the stresses acting at crack tips, thereby promoting (subcritical) crack growth and compaction creep.\nOur results also suggested that sample porosity exerted some influence on compaction creep behaviour. In samples saturated with dry supercritical CO2, the sample with 0.7% higher porosity (21.8 vs. 22.5% porosity) showed creep strain rates and AE rates approximately half an order of magnitude faster than the lower porosity sample (Fig.\u00a06c and d). Similarly, in samples with AMP solution as pore fluid, the sample with a higher porosity by 0.9% (22.4 vs. 23.3% porosity) creep strain rates were approximately one order of magnitude faster in the higher porosity sample (Fig.\u00a07c). Most likely small differences in contact area or contact structure\/cementation can explain the effect of porosity on creep rates, as these would lead to differences in stress intensity at crack tips, as well as the stress distribution around the crack tip, hence affecting crack propagation. However, we did not systematically investigate the effect of porosity on creep behaviour, so cannot infer more at present.\n\n\n4.1.2\nThe influence of supercritical fluids on compaction creep\nThe influence of supercritical fluids on compaction creep at 100 MPa effective stress is explicitly shown in Fig.\u00a09, where strain at fixed moments in time and strain rates at fixed strain are plotted as a function of water concentration. Fig.\u00a09a and c show that even when the water concentration in the supercritical fluids increases, creep strain and strain rates do not, compared with low-vacuum (dry) conditions. By comparison, pore saturation with distilled water (DI) did lead to higher creep strains and higher strain rates. In the case of low-vacuum dry conditions, the sample, and therefore the crack tip, is not actively dried (i.e.\u00a0no drying agent is added) and any water remaining in the system, e.g.\u00a0water adsorbed on clay mineral surfaces present in the sandstone or on the detrital grain surfaces, could provide water that adsorbs onto crack tips, facilitating subcritical crack growth. Upon the introduction of dry supercritical \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2, it is likely that crack tips are dried, as free and even adsorbed water is being taken up by the supercritical phases.\n79\n\n,\n\n80\n Considering the purity of the dry \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2 (see Section\u00a02.1), these phases would contain 0.3 and 8.2 mol water\/m3 and may potentially dissolve up to 19.4 and 66.7 mol water\/m3 at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and 10 MPa pore pressure, respectively. In turn, drying of the crack tips may prevent crack tip corrosion and inhibit compaction creep (see also Ref.\u00a08 for creep experiments on pure quartz sand under the same conditions).\n\nIn the case of water-saturated supercritical phases, our experiments showed that these also inhibited compaction creep compared to low-vacuum (dry) conditions. This is contrary to the results reported by Ref.\u00a08 who found that creep strain rates in quartz sand increased with increasing water content in the tested supercritical phases (\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n, CO2 and wet-CO2). In the current experiments, the supercritical phases were prepared at 60\u00a0\u00b0C to avoid water condensation upon introduction to the sample at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. This temperature difference leaves some room for water dissolution in the supercritical phase, i.e.\u00a010.3 and 32.9 mol water\/m3 in case of the wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and wet-CO2, respectively (see Refs.\u00a08, 78\u201380). Therefore, it is likely the water-saturated \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2 phases at 60\u00a0\u00b0C still had some drying potential at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and inhibited crack growth and sandstone compaction creep in the wet supercritical phases compared to low-vacuum (dry) conditions.\n\n\n4.1.3\nThe influence of aqueous solutions on compaction creep\nThe influence of aqueous solutions on Bentheim sandstone compaction is illustrated in Fig.\u00a09, where strain at fixed moments in time and strain rates at fixed strains is plotted as a function of solution pH. From these graphs, it is clear that for similar porosity samples, creep strain and strain rates tended to be lower for the acidic solutions than for distilled water. Enhanced compaction creep, AE count, creep strain rates and AE rates by the flooding with distilled water (Fig.\u00a04) or aqueous solution, compared to dry conditions, is as expected if subcritical crack growth dominates deformation.\n112\u2013116\n The strong water-weakening effect was also demonstrated by the zones of intense deformation (Fig.\u00a08e and f) that were observed in all samples saturated with distilled water or aqueous solution (except for sample HCl301). Interestingly, such a zone was also observed in the sample saturated with wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n, which was eventually wetted with distilled water (Fig.\u00a08e). We infer that the damage zone observed in sample wN201 was caused by the ingress of water, as none of the other supercritical phases displayed these microstructural features.\nFor glass and quartz, it is typically inferred that microcracking is inhibited in acidic solutions due to the (near) neutral surface charge at low pH.\n99\n\n,\n\n106\n\n,\n\n117\n\n,\n\n118\n In solution, adsorption causes the quartz surface to be covered by positively (SiOH\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n) and negatively (SiO\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n) charged surface complexes. Depending on solution pH, positive groups or negative groups dominate or they are balanced, resulting in a positively, negatively or neutrally charged surface, respectively.\n105\n\n,\n\n124\n\n,\n\n125\n For quartz, the pH of zero surface charge (pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n) is approximately 2\u20133\u00a0at room temperature,\n126\n\n,\n\n127\n and is expected to be relatively temperature insensitive.\n128\n The neutrally charged quartz surface does not actively attract corrosive species and stress corrosion microcracking is, therefore, not promoted. At solution pH > pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n, the quartz surface becomes increasingly more populated by negative surface complexes (SiO\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n) and a negative surface charge develops, promoting the attraction of corrosive species such as water and hydroxyl molecules. Their interaction with crack tips (see Section\u00a04.2) will weaken the Si-O bonds of the quartz and, hence, promote stress corrosion microcracking. This rate-controlling effect of pH on crack velocities is observed in glass and quartz\n99\n\n,\n\n106\n\n,\n\n117\n\n,\n\n118\n and in compaction creep tests on quartz sand aggregates.\n8\n However, for sandstone, a composite of quartz grains and other minerals, this influence of solution pH on crack propagation may be more complex, as each mineral has its own pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n, i.e.\u00a0for feldspar pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n = 5-7,\n129\n and for clay minerals such as kaolinite pH\n\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n=\n5\n\n.6\u20136.6,\n130\n while for illite and montmorillonite pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n = 9-10.\n130\n\n\nMeasurements of the average pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n of Bentheim sandstone have suggested that the pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n can range from 3\n131\n to 8.\n65\n\n,\n\n66\n For the lower value, it is suggested that the abundant presence of quartz controls the pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n of the sandstone. For the high value, the measured pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n is most likely dominated by the presence of thin iron oxide grain coatings,\n66\n which are typically characterised by higher a pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n of 5\u20139.\n126\n\n,\n\n127\n\n,\n\n132\n Given the low amount and isolated occurrence of feldspar present in the sample material, it is unlikely that feldspar played a significant role in controlling the amount of deformation of our Bentheim samples, as also demonstrated by the widespread microcracking in quartz grains and across quartz grain contacts (Fig.\u00a08). Therefore, we infer that it is the local pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n of quartz that controls fluid-crack-tip-interactions rather than the macroscopic pH\n\n\n\nPZC\n\n\n for Bentheim sandstone as a whole. The inhibiting effect of the acidic solutions on compaction creep may therefore reflect a reduced interaction between corrosive species and crack tips caused by near neutral surface charge.\nSuperimposed on the direct effect of solution pH, is the effect of the chemical species in solution. While it has been demonstrated that AMP and AlCl 3 solutions inhibited creep in quartz grains, they did not do so as effectively as a simple HCl solution of similar pH.\n8\n In case of the AMP solution, it has been inferred that due to incomplete dissociation of the AMP molecule (which consists of six hydroxyl groups\n133\n), some hydroxyl groups are left to attack the strained crack tips. By contrast, for quartz grains in contact with acidic AlCl 3 solution, Al3\uff0b adsorption onto the quartz surface is believed to create a disordered surface-solvent structure, thereby allowing easier access of corrosive species to the crack tip.\n124\n Unfortunately we were not able to assess the effect on creep behaviour of HCl compared to AMP and AlCl 3 due to small porosity variations between the samples. However, it is not unlikely that the same trend observed for creep in sands\n8\n also apply to sandstone, as deformation of the former is also controlled by subcritical crack growth.\n\n\n\n4.2\nSample boundary conditions and stress state evolution\nRegarding the control experiments on aluminium samples, the measurement of the unconstrained stiffness (70\u00a0GPa) corresponds well with the expected value of \nE\n (69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 GPa\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see Section\u00a02.3.1), while the measurement of the constrained stiffness (144 GPa) overestimates the expected value of \nM\n (105\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 GPa\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see Section\u00a02.3.1) by 37%. On this basis, we infer that the FEP-sleeve successfully constrained the tightly fitting aluminium sample to zero lateral strain at axial stresses above approximately 30 MPa.\nIn case of the Bentheim sandstone samples of similar porosity (22.3%) and loaded under low-vacuum (dry) conditions, the characteristic stiffness of the unconstrained sample was 7.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0 GPa, while the two constrained samples had higher stiffness values of 10.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0 GPa (loadunload) and 7.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 GPa (dry02\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see Table\u00a01). Various values for the unconstrained Young\u2019s modulus are described in the literature, ranging from 8.9 to 14.7 GPa.\n65\n\n,\n\n67\n\n,\n\n75\n Our measured value of the unconstrained sample stiffness is slightly below this range. The constrained modulus, calculated using\u00a0Eq.\u00a0(1) and assuming \nE\n is 8.9\u201314.7\u00a0GPa and \nv\n is 0.13\u20130.36,\n65\n\n,\n\n67\n\n,\n\n75\n is expected to lie in the range 9.3\u201317.6\u00a0GPa. Our measured values of \nM\n fall below and within this range. Interestingly, the unconstrained sample failed around 62 MPa applied stress, while none of the constrained samples did. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of Bentheim sandstone reported in the literature is lower than our measured UCS and varies between 30 and 40 MPa.\n65\n\n,\n\n67\n\n,\n\n75\n The discrepancies between our measured data and the literature values could be caused by the aspect length:diameter ratio of our samples, which is 1:2, as opposed to the more conventional 2:1.\n134\n This could have led to stress concentrations and clamping at the end of the sample, leading to higher failure stresses and lower sample stiffness. Considering both the difference in measured characteristic stiffness between unconstrained and constrained samples and the failure of the unconstrained sample, suggests that the FEP-sleeve approach effectively constrained the sandstone samples to zero lateral strain conditions at axial stresses above approximately 30 MPa.\nAssuming our samples were laterally constrained, application of an axial stress (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n1\n\n\n) to the sample led to the development of lateral or horizontal stresses (\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n). Assuming pure poro-elastic behaviour at constant pore fluid pressure, and assuming zero lateral strain conditions, the lateral stresses can be predicted according to\n25\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n3\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Poisson\u2019s ratio of Bentheim sandstone ranging from 0.13 to 0.36,\n65\n\n,\n\n67\n\n,\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n3\n\n\n is predicted to be 12 \n\n\u00b1\n7\n,\n27\n\u00b1\n\n 15 and 36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021 MPa for an applied effective stress of 35, 75 and 100 MPa, respectively.

We envisage that the life-time of a grain is controlled by the rate at which cracks grow, so that injection of supercritical or acidic fluids increases the time-to-failure of the material and therefore slows creep.\nFirstly, our results suggest that fluid injection into depleted, quartz-rich hydrocarbon reservoirs where the vertical effective stress has been increased by production, may be a suitable mitigation strategy for reducing long-term reservoir compaction. Injection of pressurised fluids will lower the effective stress acting on the reservoir rock, thereby reducing the driving force for reservoir compaction. In addition to this mechanical effect, a chemical effect is expected as well. For example, injection of supercritical phases that are devoid of water or contain trace water will tend to desiccate crack tips when the original water content is low, thereby reducing reservoir compaction creep rates by subcritical crack growth. In addition, injection of acidic fluids is likely to decelerate compaction creep rates, as the concomitant change in quartz surface energy will reduce subcritical crack growth rates. However, more research is needed to investigate the effect of (acidic) fluids on the compaction of impure sandstones having a larger feldspar, carbonate and clay content. Depending on the load-bearing framework, dissolution of carbonate cements on the short-term and feldspar grains on the long-term, by acidification of the pore fluid, may weaken the reservoir rock.\n123\n\n,\n\n135\n\n,\n\n136\n\n\nSecondly, porous subsurface reservoirs, such as depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, are envisioned as potential systems for permanently storing CO2 and for temporary storage of renewably derived energy in the form of synthetic fuels, compressed air and hydrogen.\n11\n In the corresponding injection operations, it is important to avoid or minimise long-term reservoir compaction and creep effects, as these may cause induced seismicity and surface subsidence.\n3\n\n,\n\n4\n\n,\n\n137\n For efficiency reasons, most fuels injected will be devoid of water or contain trace amounts of water. Our experiments employing dry and wet supercritical phases may be regarded as representative of these injection scenarios and would suggest that, in case of injection into quartz-rich reservoirs, reservoir compaction would be not be enhanced, or perhaps even inhibited, by the injection of fluids and concomitant further (local) drying of the reservoir. Furthermore, the injection of CO2 has the added advantage of contributing to reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\n138\n\n\nThirdly, geothermal energy production for renewable heat and electricity production also requires the injection of cold fluids that are in chemical disequilibrium with the receiving reservoir rock. These fluids would typically contain anti-scaling additives, such as AMP, or be acidic in nature,\n139\n\n,\n\n140\n enhancing any disequilibrium effects. During geothermal energy production, the injected and produced fluid volumes are balanced to maintain an approximately constant pore pressure in the reservoir. However, as the injected fluid will be relatively cold, the reservoir rock will be cooled, resulting in contraction of the reservoir rock and a decrease in the lateral stresses. Consequently, the differential stress acting on the reservoir rock will increase, which could provide a driving force for stress corrosion cracking. In addition, the tendency for stress corrosion cracking may be triggered by the change in chemical environment. Our experiments employing acidic solutions, including AMP, suggest that the rate of stress corrosion cracking would decrease, thereby inhibiting compaction creep, compared to injection with pure water. However, as described above, our research focused on the compaction behaviour of relatively clean sandstone, i.e.\u00a095% quartz, and more research is needed to assess the effect of (acidic) fluids on sandstones with a higher feldspar, carbonate or clay content. Acidification of the pore fluid may lead to weakening in impure sandstones through reaction of feldspars and clays,\n123\n\n,\n\n135\n\n,\n\n136\n which could affect transport properties and, thereby, impact the performance of the geothermal reservoir.\nLastly, concerning the injection of fluids for energy storage, we only looked at the scenario of a fixed applied, or overburden stress. However, in an energy storage project, most likely pore pressure will fluctuate during production, decreasing when energy is produced and increasing when energy is stored. This would mean that such energy storage systems will go through many stress-cycles throughout their lifetime. In our current study, we did not investigate the effect of stress-cycling on creep or hysteresis. However, our stiffness data collected during active pre-creep loading may be representative of injection during the first stress-cycle. Sample stiffness displayed a small dependency on water concentration and no effect of fluid pH was observed, while sample porosity did influence sample stiffness. This implies that during the first phases of fluid injection and extraction, the porosity of the reservoir rock rather than pore fluid chemistry is likely to control reservoir compaction. After the first stress-cycle, additional permanent deformation is unlikely to develop, as, depending on the rate of the stress-cycle, only a small number of new cracks will form as long as the effective stress does not exceed the maximum previously achieved stress. With prolonged injection and extraction-cycling, time-dependent chemical processes such as dissolution and subcritical crack growth are likely to have a stronger contribution to reservoir compaction and pore fluid chemistry will have a more pronounced influence on compaction rates.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nUniaxial compaction experiments were performed using samples of Bentheim sandstone saturated with supercritical fluids and aqueous solutions of different pH and composition to investigate the effects of pore fluid chemistry on (near) 1-D compaction of reservoir sandstones, at realistic in situ reservoir conditions (80\u00a0\u00b0C, effective axial stresses of 35, 75 and 100 MPa). The tested pore fluid environments included supercritical \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n, CO2, wet-\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and wet-CO2 at 10 MPa pore pressure, distilled water, pH 3.7 HCl solution, AMP-solution and AlCl 3-solution at atmospheric pressure, as well as, low-vacuum (dry) conditions. The following observations and inferences were made:\n\n\n\n1.\nDuring loading, the stiffness of Bentheim sandstone samples was independent of water content in the pore fluid and solution pH. On the other hand, sample porosity appeared to exert an influence, as more porous samples were more compliant.\n\n\n2.\nDuring the creep phase, compaction creep strain, AE count, creep strain rates and AE rates measured in low-vacuum (dry) and water-saturated (distilled water) samples increased with increasing applied stress. In addition, a clear effect of pore fluid chemistry was observed. Creep rate and AE rate increased moving from dry and wet supercritical \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2 phases, to low-vacuum (dry) conditions, to acidic aqueous solutions, to distilled water. Samples saturated with the same pore fluid but with different porosity had quantitatively different compaction behaviour. More porous samples produced more strain and AEs, which was accompanied by higher strain rates and AE rates.\n\n\n3.\nIt was inferred that compaction creep in Bentheim sandstone was controlled by subcritical crack growth by stress corrosion cracking, which is rate-dependent on the intergranular stresses and pore fluid chemistry. In turn, the rate of subcritical crack growth controls the rate of grain failure and, hence, compaction creep. Increasing the applied stress leads to larger stress concentrations at crack tips. In addition, in the more porous samples, grain-to-grain contacts were likely smaller or possessed a different structure or lower degree of cementation, such that the intergranular stresses were larger, promoting crack growth. Whereas saturation with the supercritical \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n and CO2 phases was inferred to actively dry crack tips and inhibit crack growth, saturation with distilled water fully wetted the crack tips, reducing the energy required for Si-O bond breakage and facilitating subcritical crack growth. In the case of saturation of acidic fluids, pH-dependent fluid\u2013rock interactions were inferred to lower the rate of stress corrosion cracking.\n\n\n4.\nRegarding fluid injection into quartz-rich, subsurface reservoirs characterised by ongoing reservoir compaction, the results imply that fluids devoid of water or with a minor amount of water, e.g.\u00a0supercritical phases, may be injected to mitigate reservoir compaction. Injection of acidic fluids is also likely to inhibit reservoir compaction. However, this study focused on the compaction behaviour of relatively clean sandstone, i.e.\u00a095% quartz, and more research is needed to assess the effect of fluids on sandstones with a higher feldspar, carbonate or clay content.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nM.T.W.

A promising and sustainable opportunity for low carbon heat energy is ground heat exchange and storage. However, factors such as high capital costs and adverse electricity and gas price ratios has slowed down uptake. A novel way to achieve affordable ground heat exchange is to use existing or new buried infrastructure for dual purposes: heat transfer along with the primary function. This significantly reduces capital costs and makes ground heat exchange and storage more economically feasible. It also provides opportunities to obtain heat direct from the infrastructure itself.\n2\n\n,\n\n3\n\n\nOne option for dual purpose infrastructure is heat recovery from urban water systems.\n4\u20136\n There are around 1 million kilometres of buried water supply and wastewater collection pipes in the UK, the vast majority of which are located within 1\u00a0m of the ground surface.\n7\n A reliable and all-year-round energy source can be available within these buried pipes, which largely originates from domestic wastewater.\n8\u201310\n This provides an appealing opportunity for energy harvesting through retrofitting of ground heat exchange systems. These can take the form of additional heat transfer pipes installed adjacent to the existing sewer mains. While shown to be practically viable, pilot studies suggest work to reduce capital costs is still required. Alternatively, when existing wastewater pipes are rehabilitated during future maintenance, this opportunity can be taken to add in-pipe lining systems which provide both strength and heat transfer elements. As well as these practical challenges, some technical challenges remain to be addressed.\n10\n\n,\n\n11\n This includes the effects of ambient temperature variations, properties of the surrounding soil, and the thermal interactions of adjacent pipes.\nTo date studies investigating the potential of urban water networks as alternative sources of heating have focused on outlining its feasibility by investigating water temperature and flow rate trends in wastewater collection systems.\n9\u201316\n Nevertheless, such data are scarce. Frijns et\u00a0al. \n6\n described how in the Netherlands, 60% of drinking water is heated in the house, and the temperature of wastewater leaving the house varies throughout the day and is on average 27\u00a0\u00b0C. Measurements in Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Italy have found sewage temperatures to range up to 28\u00a0\u00b0C.\n8\u201310\n\n,\n\n17\u201319\n These relatively high temperatures of wastewater can potentially provide a significant amount of heat. Hao et\u00a0al. \n20\n presented a theoretical potential of thermal energy of 4.64 kWh\/m3 for sewers based on an optimal extraction temperature of 4\u00a0\u00b0C, which is similar to that reported by McCarty et\u00a0al. \n4\n However, the potential amount of heat recovery from sewer systems depends on other factors including efficiency of any connected heat pump system, distance between recovery and heat use locations, and boundary condition effects that could cause heat losses. Using the first law of thermodynamics and assuming 100% efficient heat recovery systems, Abdel-Aal et\u00a0al. \n9\n estimated that if all UK wastewater could be lowered by 2\u00a0\u00b0C, then the 11 billion litres of wastewater produced each day (as estimated by Defra\n21\n) could potentially result in 390 TWh of heat recovery per year.\nPrevious studies have also investigated in-pipe wastewater air interactions.\n22\u201324\n However, heat transfer analysis between such underground systems and their surrounding soils and adjacent pipes have mostly been unexplored.\n25\u201327\n For instance, it is known from work on retaining wall and tunnel ground heat exchangers that the heat capacity of buried infrastructure systems is strongly dependent on the internal and external thermal boundary conditions.\n28\n\n,\n\n29\n Therefore, to develop heat recovery\/storage solutions for buried pipe infrastructure requires further characterisation of the thermal exchange capacity between underground structures, the fluids within them and the surrounding soil. By better understanding the thermal exchange processes, any potential impact, when heat is recovered or stored, on the mechanical stability of the pipes or the performance of pipe networks in delivering their primary functions, can be quantified.\nThis study examines the thermal behaviour around piped urban water systems by examining the interactions at the thermal boundaries when the system experiences a temperature perturbation that could be caused by heat exchange and storage. First, details of the experimental and numerical analysis that have been performed on a system of several adjacent buried pipes installed in a large sand tank are described in detail. Subsequently, the results are presented and the role of the boundary conditions and thermal interactions are explored. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are made for future work and practical application.\n\n\n2\nExperimental design\nA series of physical experiments were performed to investigate the heat transfer conditions around a series of buried water pipes. The important thermal interactions related to ambient air, water and pipe\/soil interfaces have been studied over ranges representative of conditions in live water supply and wastewater collection pipes. The experimental system was designed to enable evaluation of the influence of ground and groundwater conditions, as well as in-pipe flow conditions, on the potential for heat transfer both within piped water infrastructure and to the surrounding ground. Experiments were carried out at the Integrated Civil and Infrastructure Research Centre (ICAIR) at the University of Sheffield. The experimental apparatus consists of a 4.5\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 2.8 m \n\u00d7\n 30.0 m tank (h*b*l), where its base and one wall are made of concrete and the other wall is steel (Figs.\u00a01 and 2), filled with a fine silica sand of characteristics given in Table\u00a01. The thermal properties of the sand were measured using a KD2 Pro (transient line heat source method) with a dual needle SH-1 probe at a range of different moisture contents, the results of which are shown in Table\u00a02. Two sets of three 125\u00a0mm outer diameter (100\u00a0mm internal diameter) HDPE pipes are installed at depths of 2.5\u00a0m and 0.4\u00a0m, where these values refer to the depth of the upper pipes (Fig.\u00a02) in each set. All are filled with water throughout the experimental period.\nAt any one time during the experiments one of the six pipes was connected to a heating system to permit temperature perturbations to be applied to the system. The heating system comprised a large 2 m3 header tank fitted with two 9 kW electric immersion heaters, and an in-line circulation pump. Water was taken from the header tank, pumped through one of the buried pipes and then back into the header tank. Water temperature was controlled by varying heat input and sustaining the header tank temperature within 1\u00a0\u00b0C of a target value. The header tank could be connected to any of the six buried pipes at a time and a constant recirculation water flow rate was achieved using an in-line pump and a flow control valve. For each temperature-flow rate condition, the parameters were held constant until temperatures in the soil surrounding the buried pipe reached a steady state, defined as no fluctuation greater than 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C over 2 days. The results presented in this paper consider thermal activation of the deepest pipe in the lower cluster (2.74\u00a0m below the surface) of three pipes (Fig.\u00a02b) while other pipes are filled with static water. After collection of background data, and circulation of water without direct heating, two heating periods were applied to the thermally activated pipe as summarised in Table\u00a03. Due to the high flow rates used for the circulation, the temperature difference between inlet and outlet temperature of the activated pipe was close to the range of the sensor resolution, and therefore an average value of the water temperature has been presented in Table\u00a03.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pipes and surrounding sand are instrumented to evaluate how thermal energy is transferred around heated pipes to the surrounding soil, or adjacent pipes. Instrumentation of the experiments permits soil temperature mapping, and hence calibration of system models. Thermocouples are installed on three instrumented planes for monitoring the pipe and ground temperatures in the experiment box as shown in Fig.\u00a01. Fig.\u00a03 shows their position in cross section relative to the pipes and experiment boundaries. This pattern is repeated at each plane. Additional sensors are also placed at the centreline of the tank\u2019s base, and at 0.9\u00a0m and 3.0\u00a0m depths on the four side boundaries. All thermistors were calibrated and are estimated to have a temperature measurement uncertainty of 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\nAs the experiment was so large it had to be conducted in a large building without accurate environmental control. Ambient temperature conditions were thus monitored, primarily through additional thermocouples at the sand surface. These were complemented by the building\u2019s environmental control system which applied limited heating during winter to limit fluctuations in ambient temperature and relative humidity in the building environment. Variations in the surface boundary temperature were included in the numerical simulations.\nThe pipe water temperatures are monitored at several locations. Thermocouples are placed inside the pipe, on the external pipe walls, at the sand surface and inside the header tank used to heat the water. These are to ascertain the thermal exchange from the fluid to the external atmosphere through the pipe wall.\nFluid input temperatures have been systematically increased over the duration of the experiments from ambient initial conditions, in steps, to a maximum value of 43\u00a0\u00b0C. This embraces larger temperature range than expected in real urban water networks but allows some excitation of heat transfer to fully explore the significance of the various heat transfer mechanisms. The experimental facility, being essentially full-scale in cross section, has a time constant similar to a real system and so the experiments were carried out over several months, i.e.\u00a0representative of the seasonal time scales of interest in real systems.\n\n\n3\nNumerical approach\nNumerical analyses were performed and validated using the experimental data. This permitted exploration of the key thermal processes affecting the system behaviour. There were limited temperature variations along the pipe connected to the heating system (refer to results presented in Section\u00a04.1). This meant that a two-dimensional numerical analysis, using a vertical cross section of the system could be justified, Fig.\u00a04. The cell-centred finite volume method (FVM) as implemented in the OpenFOAM library was employed in the form of a conjugate heat transfer and fluid flow solver: chtMultiRegionFoam. OpenFOAM is an open-source package with variety of predesigned solvers for various types of applications of continuum mechanics.\n30\n Previous validated applications of OpenFOAM in ground heat transfer and storage include district heating and borehole heat exchangers.\n31\n\n,\n\n32\n\n\nTo account for disparate continua comprising the domain shown in Fig.\u00a04, separate regions were defined in the simulations corresponding to sand, pipes and fluids. Such an approach with the solver in question allows a segregated solution strategy for different continuum\/region in the domain, i.e.\u00a0solving energy equation for all of the domain and also the Navier Stokes equations for liquids. However, full solution of the Navier Stokes equations is computationally expensive. Therefore, to substantially reduce the computational intensity of our simulations two alternative approaches were adopted for fluids in the domain. In both cases, forced convection is assumed within the thermal activated pipe, while two scenarios have been adopted for the pipes where the water is static. In one scenario (scenario #1) all static water is treated as solid in the model for computational efficiency. This explicitly assumes no flow, either forced or due to temperature driven buoyancy effects, and initially appeared a reasonable assumption given no circulation was occurring and the temperature changes were known from monitoring data to be small. In a second scenario (scenario #2), convective boundary conditions are imposed on the inner surfaces of the two pipes in the embedded deeper cluster which are closest to the thermally activated pipe and therefore would experience some changes in temperature. While not subject to forced convection, the water in these pipes could theoretically experience some thermally driven water flow due to the temperature gradients leading to changes in fluid density along the pipes. This approach stops short of a full solution of the Navier Stokes equations, hence saving computational effort, but yet still allows for a small amount of buoyancy driven flow to be accounted for.\nThe governing equation in all regions of the numerical domain is the energy equation as shown in Eq.\u00a0(1) and the coupling at the interface between the regions is expressed using Eq.\u00a0(2): \n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\n\u03c1\nH\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nx\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\u2202\nH\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nx\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nn\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where H is the specific enthalpy, \n\u03c1\n is the density and \n\n\u03b1\n=\n\u03bb\n\/\n\n\nC\n\n\np\n\n\n\n is the thermal diffusivity which is defined as the ratio between the thermal conductivity \n\u03bb\n and the specific heat capacity \n\n\nC\n\n\np\n\n\n. In Eq.\u00a0(2)\nn represents the direction normal to the interface wall, T is the temperature while s and f denote solid and fluid respectively.\n\n\n\n\n3.1\nGeometry and meshing\nThe corresponding two-dimensional numerical domain is 4.5\u00a0m by 3\u00a0m in size, details of which are shown in Fig.\u00a04. It comprises three regions of sand, pipes, and fluids and is created and discretised using a combination of structured and unstructured meshing tools within OpenFOAM as illustrated in Fig.\u00a05, highlighting the boundary conditions. A relatively coarse structured mesh is applied over the entire region that is progressively reduced and switched into unstructured mesh towards regions where higher temperature gradient is expected, i.e.\u00a0pipes and their corresponding interfaces. Mesh independence analysis have been carried out to verify satisfactory geometrical mesh and grid independence of the numerical results. The total number of grid cells for the domain was about 106 ranging from 2.7\n\u00d7\n10\u22127 m2 to 0.09 m2 in size.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nMaterials thermal properties\nMaterial properties relevant to heat transfer analysis are the thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density. The properties for sand in the numerical model are implemented using data in Table\u00a02 that are derived from in-situ measurements showing 7% moisture content. It should be noted that thermal properties of sand are highly dependent on its water content, which can significantly affect the heat transfer through this region.\n33\n\nTable\u00a04 details the thermal properties of the materials used in the simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nInitial and boundary conditions\n\n3.3.1\nPipes\nForced convection is assumed within the thermally activated pipe, for which the heat transfer coefficient for the flowing water, \n\n\nh\n\n\nf\n\n\n, is determined using the Gnielinski correlation\n34\n\n,\n\n35\n as shown in Eq.\u00a0(3): \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\ne\n\u2212\n1000\n\n\nP\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\nr\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n12\n.\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\/\n3\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nf\n\n\n is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, here water, f is the Darcy\u2013Weisbach\u200b friction factor, Re is the Reynolds Number, and Pr is the Prandtl Number as defined through Eq.\u00a0(4) to 6 respectively.

In the scenario where convective boundary conditions are also imposed on the inner surfaces of the two pipes adjacent to the thermal activated pipe (scenario #2), very small convection heat transfer coefficients, 30 Wm\u22122K\u22121, together with a constant fluid temperature equal to the initial condition is used for all stages of the study. This approach was taken to represent laminar flow conditions in these pipes.\n\n\n3.3.2\nOutside boundaries\nRecorded ambient temperature variations are imposed on the model top surface of the sand tank while a mixed boundary condition is imposed on the base of the sand tank as well as the lower half of the side walls to represent heat transfer through these surfaces. This type of boundary condition allows heat flux on the external walls through specifying a fixed heat transfer coefficient and adjacent temperature. The upper half of the side walls are given a zero heat flux condition, i.e.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nn\n\n\n=\n0\n\n. These choices of boundary conditions along with suitable values of the heat transfer coefficient imposed on the external walls are based on a series of calibration analyses to identify the appropriate boundary condition types for the domain (refer to Section\u00a04). This choice of boundary conditions was applied after initial investigation showed that temperature changes from the ambient interface within the experimental facility are more important in the upper half of the side walls, while lateral heat losses dominate beneath this point.\n\n\n3.3.3\nInitial conditions\nThe initial temperatures of all materials and boundaries are assigned based on the corresponding experimental values.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nExperimental results\nThe variation of the upstream and downstream temperatures in the thermally activated pipe are shown in Fig.\u00a06 for the full duration of the experiment. Since the experiment was undertaken in the spring and summer a trend of generally increasing ambient air temperature within the experimental facility can be seen. Superimposed on this trend are the specific daily variations. Since no heat input (with the exception of the small amount of pumping energy) occurs until around 1630\u00a0h from commencement, it can be seen that the ambient air temperature variations have a strong influence on various parts of the system. Between the commencement of the test and the start of the first heating phase, the ambient air temperature increases by approximately 5\u00a0\u00b0C. Within the sand tank the increase in temperature is more modest, falling from 4\u00a0\u00b0C at 0.9\u00a0m depth, to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C at 3\u00a0m depth and to 1\u00a0\u00b0C at the base of the tank (4.5\u00a0m depth). This shows the expected diminishing impact of the surface conditions at greater depth, but none the less confirms its influence even to the base of the experiment.\nMeanwhile, the thermally activated pipe, which is embedded at 2.74\u00a0m depth, changes temperature prior to heating by approximately 4\u00a0\u00b0C. This change largely corresponds with the changes in ambient conditions and is a reflection that (i) the header tank is in likely equilibrium with its environment, and (ii) the surface pipework between the header tank and the point the pipe enters the sand is not completely insulated. Additionally, the small increase in the fluid temperature above ambient temperature during initial circulation may reflect heat input from pumping. After the commencement of the first heating phase, stage 3 in Fig.\u00a06, the temperature of the water in the thermally activated pipe increases to reflect that of the now heated water in the header tank. As the tank is no longer in equilibrium with the surrounding air, the water is proportionally less influenced by ambient conditions. In these two last phases of the test, i.e.\u00a0stages 3 and 4, the temperature at the base of sand tank and at greater depth also shows an acceleration of temperature increase. This reflects the fact that some of the heat injected into the system is being lost at the side and base boundaries.\nFrom about 2150 to 2320\u00a0h the flow rate was reduced to 0.42 l\/s in an attempt to investigate laminar flow conditions, however, the system was unable to maintain a stable flow and the minimal flow rate in the tank resulted in a lack of mixing which meant the PID controller was unable to maintain a steady temperature, as shown in Fig.\u00a06. After the increase to 43\u00a0\u00b0C, there remained some small high frequency fluctuations in the temperature due to the limitations of the temperature control system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nSimulation results\n\n4.2.1\nCalibration\nThe initial experimental data, prior to heating, were used to calibrate the model boundary conditions. Initially all the side walls and the tank base were prescribed with a zero heat flux boundary condition while the top surface was exposed to ambient air. This allowed examination of the effect of ambient air temperature on heat transfer in various parts of the domain as well as confirming the appropriateness of the thermal properties of the sand used in the model. Ambient air temperatures were observed to dominantly control temperature variations in the system over the first and second stages of the analysis (corresponding to stages 1 and 2 of the experiments as shown in Fig.\u00a06), particularly at shallow depths. Meanwhile in deeper locations, heat losses at the sides and base clearly became more important, especially in the first and second heating stages, i.e.\u00a0stages 3 and 4 in Fig.\u00a06. Therefore, the thermal boundary conditions were switched to use (i) heat flux boundary conditions to allow for heat transfer through the lower parts of the domain including the tank base and the lower part of the side walls, and (ii) an adiabatic boundary condition over the upper half of the side walls. This proved a more appropriate representative of the heat losses effecting the tank. By a process of calibration to minimise the difference between measured and simulated temperatures on these boundaries, the values of heat transfer coefficient for the heat flux boundaries on base and lower half of the sidewalls were fixed at 1.2 and 0.1 Wm\u22122K\u22121 respectively, while the initial condition was used as the external surface temperature. This approach seems reasonable given the initial thermal conditions of the building substructure and its properties are uncertain. These values were used for all stages of the simulation.\n\n\nA comparison between the experimental and numerical analysis for temperature variations along the walls and the tank base with the described arrangements are shown in Fig.\u00a07(a)\u2013(d) and Fig.\u00a08. Modifying the side walls boundary conditions to allow for heat transfer through the lower parts of the domain including tank base and side walls, as shown in Fig.\u00a05, resulted in better agreement between numerical simulations and experimental results compared to adiabatic boundary conditions, which emphasises the significance of heat loss to the base and sides of the tank over this timescale despite its large size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2\nPipe interactions\nTwo scenarios are presented in Fig.\u00a09(a) to (d). The case where a convective boundary condition is applied only to the thermally activated pipe (scenario #1), with the two adjacent pipes treated as purely conductive to reduce computational time, and the case where all three pipes in the lower cluster have convective boundary conditions at their internal surface (scenario #2). In the latter case low values are assumed for very small flow rates. It can be seen that a good match to the experimental data can only be obtained when interactions are accounted for with the adjacent pipes, even though there is no flow imposed on the water within these pipes. Otherwise, neglecting these heat losses, results in much higher temperature prediction at and near the thermally activated pipe. Temperature distributions for scenario #2 within the domain across the four stages of the analysis are illustrated in Fig.\u00a010.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nImplications for heat exchange and storage\nWhen seeking to understand the thermal processes operating around a heated buried water pipe it is important to consider both the key mechanisms of heat transfer and the impact of boundary conditions and other interactions. The sand tank simulation results support the suggestion that the main heat transfer mechanisms in the surrounding soils was conduction. While theoretically the materials used and the low moisture content (measured to be around 7%, or degree of saturation of 17%) suggest that there could be some scope for thermal redistribution of moisture (Fig.\u00a011), no evidence could be found for this. While we were not able to test for moisture content close to the thermally activated pipe after the test was complete, numerical investigation did not suggest any significant effect. Specifically, consideration of a lower thermal conductivity material near the thermally activated pipe during the later test stages did not improve the simulation fit to the experimental data. However, this may not be the case for all ground conditions, and smaller grain sizes with high degrees of saturation could be susceptible to enhanced heat transfer and soil drying due to heat injection. Additionally, real water pipe networks are likely to extend across different soil types and degrees of saturation where a range of behaviours could be expected.\nThe second major aspect highlighted by this study is the importance of boundary conditions and pipe interactions. Even in a relatively large sand tank (4.5\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 2.8\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 30.0\u00a0m), once long enough timescale experiments are conducted the boundaries are seen to influence the results. In this case accounting for the lateral and basal heat losses were important to matching the results with simulation. For a real scheme to use water pipe networks for thermal exploitation this means that in the timescale of use (inter-seasonal storage and\/or extraction) the zone of influence of any thermal activated pipe is quite large. Consequently any analysis or design approach needs to consider not just trench backfill materials, but local geology and ground water conditions and any other sources or sinks of heat within that zone. Since many pipes are at shallow depths, the inclusion of ambient interference in any analysis is therefore essential.\nFurthermore, many water, wastewater and other utility infrastructure installations are found within close proximity to each other in practice. The results of these experiments demonstrate that these could all act as additional heat sinks. In the experiment presented, the water in the adjacent pipes was static but, in practice, it is likely that any heat losses or gains would be amplified by forced convection. Electrical cables are also well known as a source of heat\n38\n and so may be considered in the heat transfer analysis as well as potentially provide additional resources that could be harvested by near-by water and wastewater pipes.\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for further work\nThe experiment presented is one of the first such large scale trials of heating extraction or injection related to buried pipe networks. As such it highlights a number of areas where further valuable experimental data could be gathered in extensions to the work.\nDue to a combination of pipe flow rates and temperature sensor accuracy the difference in temperature between upstream and downstream conditions was relatively small. For future assessment of energy potential from water pipelines, consideration of the heat losses along the pipeline rather than just perpendicular to it will be required. This important aspect has been outside of the scope of this present study but will need to be addressed in future work. Lessons in this regard may be learned from the analysis and modelling of district heating networks.\n31\n\n\nThe perimeter heat losses indicated in this study were found to be of some significance. Further experimental work, or numerical assessment will either need to take into account an even larger domain, or preferably facilitate measurement of heat fluxes at experiment boundaries to avoid the need for model calibration. For experiments at full scale in the field, this also suggests the need for accompanying temperature sensors to be several metres from any activated pipes.\nFinally, to confirm the principal means of heat transfer, inclusion of water content and\/or thermal conductivity sensors within the experiment domain would be beneficial to monitor whether there are noticeable changes to moisture conditions as a result of thermal processes.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nExperimental and numerical analysis were carried out to investigate the thermal regime in a system of buried pipes where one pipe was thermally activated. Our results demonstrate that:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nFor the low moisture content fine sand used in the investigation, thermal conductivity is the dominant heat transfer mechanism. No evidence of moisture movement was ascertained.\n\n\n\u2022\nDespite burial of the pipes at about 2.5\u00a0m depth, the ambient environmental interactions were important. While the temperature changes caused by ambient effects were small in this case compared with the heat injected in the relatively warm ambient conditions, heat gained or lost to the environment will need to be accounted for when considering both summer and winter conditions.\n\n\n\u2022\nAlthough only the deepest pipe in the system was activated, the presence of fluid in two adjacent pipes were found to have an important effect on the heat transfer process from the activated pipe highlighting that other activity in urban environment will influence pipe thermal behaviour.\n\n\n\u2022\nEven for the 2.8\u00a0m wide sand tank used over the 4 months of the experiment significant heat losses occurred to the sides and base of the tank.\n\n\n\nTaken together these conclusions suggest that design and analysis approaches for water and wastewater pipe networks used for heat exchange and storage need careful consideration. This should include environmental interactions, heat losses and gains to adjacent pipes or other infrastructure, and in ground conditions for a number of metres from the buried pipes. While these interactions are able to be captured by a 2D diffusion simulation, less computationally demanding 3D analysis methods will be required for full pipelines. Whether non-diffusive simulations of ground thermal processes could also become important in certain scenarios also remains to be investigated.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nI.

In recent years, an increasing number of installations using shallow geothermal technologies (e.g.,\u00a0energy geostructures, EGs) have been recorded around the world.\n1\n In EGs, the dual role of geostructures is enhanced: they involve structural support and a geothermal heat exchanger role. The EG has proven to be an efficient renewable solution for heating\/cooling of the built environment.\n2\n This technology has been approached by the scientific community and shows a promising future.\n1\n\n,\n\n3\n Examples of underground energy infrastructures (UEIs) include but are not limited to underground circular and cut-and-cover tunnels used for transportation and\/or services, underground train stations, trenches, and sewers. Within UEIs, heat exchangers (i.e.,\u00a0plastic pipes) can be secured to the steel cage of the reinforced concrete geostructure, and they exchange heat with the surrounding materials by circulating a fluid.\nKnowledge on UEIs lacks feedback from real monitored installations, whose experience could be crucial to fully understand the performance of ongoing multiphysical processes and to allow design optimization strategies and guidelines for future installations. In this regard, few field experiments are available in the literature. Attempts to understand the thermal behavior highlighted that the heat exchanger (HE) configuration plays a crucial role and that wall\u2013tunnel thermal interactions could be non-negligible.\n4\u20136\n Different thermal performances for energy walls (EWs) and slabs were recorded, with the former outperforming the latter for the particular case study presented in\u00a0Refs.\u00a07, 8 As regard to the thermomechanical behavior, low-magnitude thermally induced deformations were registered at the Lainzer U2 line in Vienna.\n9\n The complex multiphysical aspects involved within UEI operations make it difficult to thoroughly understand and describe their thermal, hydraulic and mechanical behavior.\n10\n From an energy performance perspective, the thermal response test (i.e.,\u00a0TRT) execution for UEI is challenging, as reported by Refs.\u00a011, 12. Despite the interesting knowledge acquired from these studies, no guidelines for TRT execution on geostructures facing air interfaces are available.\nExploiting a new UEI installation in Geneva (Switzerland), thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) in situ tests were possible. This represented a unique opportunity to further investigate fundamental aspects linked to the multiphysical behavior of UEIs, as well as to develop preliminary guidelines for successful THM in situ test execution. The UEI was tested under real operational conditions, which means that it was subjected to heating\/cooling geothermal operations along with mechanical and environmental actions. The study was conducted with the following objectives: (i) to investigate the real THM behavior of the UEI through a series of full-scale in situ experimental tests upon heating and cooling thermal inputs; (ii) to understand the rationale behind fundamental THM aspects linked to thermal activation of underground infrastructures; and (iii) to propose preliminary guidelines for in situ test execution.\nIn this paper, after a description of the tested site and experimental setup, hydrothermal aspects are approached, followed by thermomechanical ones. Experimental results are presented, discussed and interpreted with the help of numerical simulations validated against experimental results, which allow us to have a complete picture of the THM aspects involved in UEI operation. Concluding remarks on the geothermal exploitation of the tested UEI are finally reported.\n\n\n2\nThe experimental campaign\nIn this section, the implemented energy geostructure is outlined, and then the experimental campaign and setup is described.\n\n2.1\nThe tested energy geostructure\nThe tested site is located in the southwestern part of Geneva, Switzerland. A new railway line that connects Geneva to Annemasse (France) was recently constructed. One of the train stations, Lancy-Bachet, is equipped with EWs and energy slabs presenting a total thermoactive surface of approximately 5000\u00a0m2. In plain view, the train station represents the entrance point of the underground tunnel portion, going toward Annemasse. A vertical cross section is depicted in Fig.\u00a01, while photos of the site are shown in Fig.\u00a02. The accessible underground space consists of two levels (Fig.\u00a01), where the bottom level (level -2) is the railway level. At level -2, an architectural element composed of a glass wall sustained by a steel structure is installed at a distance of \n\n1\n\nm\n\n from the concrete walls (Fig.\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a02(a)). The space between these two walls is partly separated into two regions by a steel grid, hereafter named levels -2\u00a0A and -2B (Fig.\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a02(a), respectively). This architectural choice will affect the airflow near the wall, a topic that will be further expanded later in this paper. A technical room is located at level -1. The train station entrance for the passengers is at the ground level (level 0).\n\n\nThe vertical walls surrounding the train station and the base slab are equipped with HEs. The vertical walls are equipped with one U-loop every 2.5\u00a0m in the tunnel longitudinal direction, with a pipe spacing of 0.25\u00a0m and external and inner pipe diameters of \n\n25\n\n mm and \n\n23\n\n mm, respectively. The total length of each heat exchanger circuit in the walls is \n\n36\n\n m. The HEs are installed inside the concrete geostructure, attached to the reinforcement cage and placed at a distance 0.20\u00a0m from the wall-soil interface. The walls are \n1\n m thick, which means that the HEs are placed at a distance 0.80\u00a0m from the wall\u2013air interface facing the tunnel. The 2.2\u00a0m thick slab is equipped with heat exchanger loops having a slinky shape and pipe spacing of 0.5\u00a0m. Every heat exchanger circuit in the wall and slab is connected in parallel to the main pipe connections. The entire piping system is eventually collected in a technical room. The portion tested in this study is composed of one single heat exchanger U-loop of the wall. The authors were not allowed to test larger portions of the UEI because of access restrictions.\nThe soil profile (Fig.\u00a01) is characterized by a backfilling layer in the first 2.0\u00a0m, a layer of normally consolidated (NC) clay until a depth \n\nz\n=\n\u2212\n17\n.\n6\n\n m, a layer of slightly overconsolidated clay (OC) until \n\nz\n=\n\u2212\n23\n.\n6\n\n m, and a layer of dense gravel at the bottom, which hosts the groundwater table. During soil characterization, all soil layers were fully saturated, as from the analyses on samples taken from the site. Table\u00a01 reports the material properties, where \nE\n is the Young modulus, \n\u03bd\n is the Poisson ratio, \n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\ns\na\nt\n\n\n is the unit weight for saturated conditions, \nn\n is the porosity, and \n\u03b1\n is the thermal expansion coefficient. The material properties for the NC clay and OC clay are determined on the basis of an analysis of samples taken from the site. The material properties of the backfilling and gravel materials were determined on the basis of a literature review.\n13\n\n,\n\n14\n Thermal properties are estimated through a dedicated in situ test (i.e.,\u00a0the TRT), as described in the following Section\u00a04.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nThe testing campaign\nThe testing campaign contained two phases. First, a TRT was executed in August 2019, following the available standards.\n15\n Second, heat pump (HP) tests were performed, which allowed us to execute heating and cooling tests at constant inflow temperature and simulate real geothermal operation scenarios. HP tests were executed in December 2019 (heating) and March 2020 (cooling). To execute and monitor the experimental tests under different geothermal operation modes, a dedicated monitoring system was designed by the authors to monitor the hydrothermal behavior of the heat carrier fluid (HCF) inside the heat exchangers and the hydrothermal behavior of the air environment at levels -1 and -2 and to record wall intrados deformations at level -2 (Fig.\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a02). The experimental equipment used during the tests is installed at two levels (-1 and -2), which are separated and do not communicate with one another.\nThe equipment installed at level -1 is, in the first stage, the heating module, called the TRT module,\n16\n which is connected to the HE circuit Fig.\u00a02(b). The TRT module applies constant thermal power to the HE circuit, as is usually employed for standard TRTs.\n16\u201320\n In a later stage, the TRT module was replaced by a water-to-air HP (i.e.,\u00a0a commercial heat pump: Ciat Ereba 11HT He), which allows heating\/cooling tests to be performed by imposing the temperature at the inflow point of the HE circuit (i.e.,\u00a0the HP outflow). For the TRT module and the HP, a dedicated hydrothermal monitoring system is installed, allowing continuous (i.e.,\u00a0one record every 30\u00a0s) monitoring of the following parameters: (i) the HCF temperature at the inflow and return end of the HE circuit, (ii) the HCF flow rate, and (iii) the air temperature at the HP ventilator, inside the TRT module and of the undisturbed air of level -1.\nThe equipment installed at level -2 consists of a thermomechanical monitoring system (Fig.\u00a02(a)) specifically designed for this tested site.\n21\n The monitoring system is designed to allow the measurement of key parameters that govern the heat fluxes and the hydrothermal heat exchanges between the EG and tunnel air, as well as the wall intrados deformations. It allows real-time monitoring (i.e.,\u00a0one record every 5\u00a0min) of (i) air temperature and (ii) the wind speed in the tunnel and (iii) structural deformations at the wall intrados. Air temperature and velocity are measured through temperature sensors and anemometers (i.e.,\u00a0a resolution of \n\n0\n.\n1\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n for temperature and \n\n0\n.\n05\n\nm\n\/\ns\n\n for wind velocity) placed at two locations (pos. -2\u00a0A and pos. -2B in Fig.\u00a02(a, c, d)): at the top part in front of the glass wall (i.e.,\u00a0Pos. -2B) to monitor the train station environment; in the bottom part behind the glass wall (i.e.,\u00a0Pos. -2\u00a0A) to monitor the environment behind the glass wall. Structural monitoring is performed by employing deformation sensors (i.e.,\u00a011 uniaxial, vibrating wire strain gauges that read strain and temperature with a resolution of \n\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03b5\n\n and \n\n0\n.\n1\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n, respectively) that are screwed to the wall intrados and installed, alternatively, in the vertical and longitudinal directions (Fig.\u00a02(e)). The air temperature distribution near the wall intrados is captured through strain gauge readings. All the instruments are connected to a datalogger installed at level -2B. Because the geostructure was already partly constructed at the time of these experiments and the ground surface was a construction site, there was no possibility to install any monitoring system in the soil or inside the concrete geostructure. The data collected through this monitoring system enable a detailed assessment of the hydrothermal behavior of the train station environment (i.e.,\u00a0a time series of air temperature and wind speed) from August 2019 until June 2020. These experimental data allow for a detailed assessment of the boundary conditions of the numerical model reported in this work.\nThe experimental tests involving thermal activation of the HE circuit were of different types. First, a TRT was executed in August 2019. This test contained two phases: An initial phase of fluid circulation lasted 2 days, followed by the heating phase at a constant thermal power \n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nt\nh\n\n\n=\n1\n\nkW\n=\n45\n\nW\n\/\nm\n\n of wall depth for 24 days. Second, the heat pump tests involved HCF heating (i.e.,\u00a0imposed inflow temperature \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n50\n.\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n) and cooling (i.e.,\u00a0\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n1\n.\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n) tests and were performed between December 2019 and March 2020. Each test lasted approximately 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n3\nHydrothermal behavior: experimental results\nThis section presents the results related to (i) the hydrothermal behavior of the train station and the experimental results of the (ii) TRT and (iii) heating\/cooling HP tests.\n\n3.1\nHydrothermal behavior at the train station level\nThe train station hydrothermal behavior is detailed here with reference to (i) its seasonal temperature evolution with correlation to the ground surface environmental temperature and (ii) the wind speed profile and the interactions with the train circulation effects. The monitored results are compared with the surface temperature measurements taken by M\u00e9t\u00e9o Suisse at the Gen\u00e8ve Airport weather station.\nFrom the thermal interactions between the tunnel and ground surface (i.e.,\u00a0external) temperature evolution, two behaviors are apparent (Fig.\u00a03). From August to October and from March to June, the tunnel temperature follows periodic behavior daily, which is lower than the external temperature during the day and higher at night. During a period, the average difference between the tunnel and external temperatures is, in absolute terms, approximately \n\n6\n.\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n and \n\n4\n.\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n for day and night, respectively. The tunnel temperature varies between \n\n12\n.\n2\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n and \n\n30\n.\n1\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The external temperature varies between \n\n\u2212\n2\n.\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n and \n\n33\n.\n8\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The temperature recorded at position -2B is generally higher than that at position -2\u00a0A. From the end of October to March, the tunnel temperature behaves periodically on a daily basis and is always (i.e.,\u00a0during day and night) higher than that recorded outside. The difference between the tunnel temperature and external temperature varies between \n\n3\n\u00f7\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The tunnel temperature varies between \n\n6\n.\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n and \n\n13\n.\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The external temperature varies between \n\n\u2212\n5\n.\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n and \n\n13\n.\n1\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The minimum values are lower at position -2B than at -2\u00a0A.\nThe wind speed profile (Fig.\u00a03) shows two behaviors, occurring before and after the start of train traffic circulation (i.e.,\u00a0on December 15th, 2019, Fig.\u00a04(a)). Before the start of train traffic circulation, wind speed values greater than \n\n0\n.\n5\n\nm\n\/\ns\n\n (i.e.,\u00a0the lower operational limit of the instrument) are recorded sporadically. A limited difference between the values measured at positions -2\u00a0A and -2B is reported. After the start of train traffic circulation (Fig.\u00a03 and Fig.\u00a04), more frequent wind speeds higher than the thresholds are recorded. This behavior is described in detail in Fig.\u00a04, which reports the overall airflow behavior before and after the beginning of train circulation (Fig.\u00a04(a)), denoting periodic daily behavior after December 15, 2019. Fig.\u00a04(b) shows the correlation between air speed measurements and the passage of trains at three times of a typical day (i.e.,\u00a0morning, afternoon, evening). The peaks of the air speed values coincide perfectly with the train passages, which were taken by studying the train timetable available at the train station.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1\nDefinition of the yearly temperature profiles near the underground energy infrastructure\nThe measurements allow us to reconstruct the yearly temperature profiles in the environments located near the UEI that affect thermal exploitation. These values, which are summarized in Table\u00a02, are also used as boundary conditions for the numerical model that simulates the in situ tests, as presented in Section\u00a04.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nTRT\nThe test started with a fluid circulation phase (i.e.,\u00a0no heating), which lasted 2 days. The duration was chosen after running a preliminary test a few weeks in advance, with a duration of one week, that showed no fluid temperature fluctuations on a day\/night basis. The heat injection phase at constant power lasted 24 days, which is considered sufficient to reach the steady state.\nDuring the fluid circulation phase, the fluid temperature reached a constant value of \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ne\nx\np\n\n\n=\n17\n.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC, which represents the average temperature of the wall subjected to the effects linked to the soil, tunnel and ground surface temperatures (Fig.\u00a05). This value is slightly higher than the average soil temperature values recorded for European climates,\n16\n\n,\n\n22\n\n,\n\n23\n suggesting that the soil temperature distribution could be affected by the presence of the tunnel. During the heating phase (i.e.,\u00a0application of constant power), the fluid temperature rapidly increased. Two distinct periods are clearly distinguished: an initial, transient phase of approximately \n\n5\n\u00f7\n7\n\n days is followed by a steady state condition, in which the fluid temperature slowly increases with time (Fig.\u00a05. The temperature difference between the inflow and outflow remains constant throughout the heating phase and is equal to \n\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nHeat pump tests\nTo test the UEI behavior under realistic heating\/cooling operation modes, additional tests were executed. The equipment used during these tests consists of a water-to-air heat pump (HP) located at level -1, which replaces the TRT module. A dedicated hydrothermal monitoring system is designed for this installation. This monitoring system allows for continuous measurement of (i) inflow and outflow fluid temperatures, \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n, respectively; (ii) the flow rate, \n\n\nV\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n, of the HCF; (iii) the air temperature at the HP ventilator, \n\n\nT\n\n\nv\ne\nn\nt\ni\nl\na\nt\no\nr\n\n\n; and (iv) the technical room temperature, \n\n\nT\n\n\nt\nr\n\n\n. Heating and cooling tests at constant inflow temperature were executed between December 2019 and March 2020 to simulate realistic summer and winter operations, respectively. The HP allows for setting a user-defined \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n, and it automatically sets the time-dependent behavior of the internal circulation pump (i.e.,\u00a0settings of flow rate) to ensure the best functioning and respect for the maximum and minimum internal temperatures to avoid any excessive heating and\/or fluid freezing.\nThe objectives of these tests are to reach limiting values (maximum and minimum) of the HCF temperature representative of future UEI operations. In other words, these tests aim to represent worst-case scenarios in terms of the temperature difference imposed on the UEI from a thermomechanical viewpoint and best-case scenarios in terms of thermal exploitation (i.e.,\u00a0highest thermal power). In the following, the results for heating and cooling tests are reported and discussed.\n\n3.3.1\nHeating tests\nA heating test was executed in December 2019. The time of year in which the tests were performed was imposed by the construction site\u2019s tight schedule. Heating tests represent the summer behavior of a UEI: heat is injected in the ground to produce fresh air used for air conditioning of the superstructure. The heating test performed in this context aims at achieving high temperature levels in the range of values normally used in low enthalpy geothermal applications and for heat storage operations.\n24\u201328\n During heating tests (i.e.,\u00a0summer operation), the HCF is therefore cooled by exchanging heat with the surrounding materials, which are at a lower temperature than that imposed by the heat pump. As a result, the wall and soil are heated. Finally, the heat pump, via its refrigerating internal cycle, produces fresh air.\nHeat injection at constant temperature was performed by fixing \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n50\n.\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The observed HP behavior is continuous and cyclic (Fig.\u00a06(a)), with approximately 2 cycles per hour. The heat pump is switched on for approximately 15\u00a0min, when \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n increases to the set value, and then for approximately 15\u00a0min, \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n gently decreases to allow for thermal recharging around the HEs. \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n varies between \n\n45\n.\n0\n\u00f7\n56\n.\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n varies accordingly, with a slight time shifting of a few seconds. The average HCF temperature variation between the outflow and inflow is \n\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n=\n5\n.\n9\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The flow rate varies between \n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n18\n\u00f7\n27\n\nL\n\/\nmin\n\n. The average thermal power injected (i.e.,\u00a0negative) by HP operation is \n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nt\nh\n,\nf\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n7\n\nkW\n\n. A global view of the heating test is provided in Fig.\u00a07(a).\n\n\n3.3.2\nCooling test\nA cooling test was performed in March 2020. The cooling test represents the winter behavior of a UEI: a cold HCF is injected into the HEs, and by extracting heat from the surroundings, the fluid is heated until the outlet point. It follows that the materials within the UEI (i.e.,\u00a0pipes, wall, soil and tunnel) are cooled as heat is extracted by the HCF. During this operation, the HP produces hot air for heating the superstructure. The cooling test performed here aims at achieving the lowest values of HCF temperature allowable by the HP, simulating a real winter operation.\n3\n\n,\n\n7\n\n,\n\n10\u201312\n\n,\n\n29\u201333\n\n\nThe inflow temperature was set to \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n1\n.\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The heat pump response was highly discontinuous on a periodic basis (Fig.\u00a06(b)). The HP switched on for a limited period (i.e.,\u00a0approximately 25\u00a0min per hour) and then switched off, stopping the imposition of the inflow temperature but allowing the fluid to circulate at ambient temperature. In this way, temporary thermal recharge of the materials surrounding the HCF was possible, and heat extraction could afterwards resume. This strongly intermittent, periodic behavior occurred because the minimum allowable HCF temperature value was reached, and the HP needed to stop to avoid freezing issues. The inflow temperature ranged between \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n5\n\u00f7\n9\n.\n2\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The outlet temperature varied between \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n=\n2\n.\n3\n\u00f7\n8\n.\n2\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The average inflow-outlet fluid temperature difference was \n\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n2\n.\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The flow rate ranged between \n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n12\n\u00f7\n24\n\nL\n\/\nmin\n\n. The average thermal power extracted (i.e.,\u00a0positive) was \n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nt\nh\n,\nf\n\n\n=\n2\n\nkW\n\n. A global view of the cooling test is shown in Fig.\u00a07(b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nHydrothermal behavior: numerical modeling\n\n4.1\nFeatures of the numerical analyses\nA 3D finite element model (i.e.,\u00a0thermomechanical, featuring for the non-isothermal fluid flow in the HE) used to simulate the in situ test and to interpret the results is built using the software COMSOL Multiphysics.\n34\n\n\nThe objectives for the numerical analyses are (i) to help determine the thermal characteristics of the materials involved in the heat exchanges; (ii) to give a comprehensive overview of the hydrothermal behavior of the UEI, highlighting the soil temperature distribution before and during the tests, the volume of materials affected by the thermal exchanges, and the direction and magnitude of the wall\u2013tunnel and wall\u2013soil heat fluxes; and (iii) to study the thermomechanical behavior. Some of the parameters measured experimentally are input parameters for the numerical model (e.g.,\u00a0inflow temperature and velocity, boundary conditions), while others are back-analyzed to calibrate the numerical model to best fit the experimental data (e.g.,\u00a0thermal characteristics of materials). The model dimensions are \n\n186\n\n m \n\u00d7\n\n\n\n55\n\n m \n\u00d7\n\n\n\n100\n\n m in the \nx\n-, \ny\n-, and \nz\n-coordinates (Fig.\u00a08). The HEs are modeled following the technical details of the geostructural design. The soil and structure are modeled as fully saturated porous materials. The groundwater is considered in stationary condition with null velocity; hence, convective heat exchanges within the soil are neglected. The mathematical formulation and details of the numerical model are reported in Appendix\u00a0A.\n\nThe thermal boundary conditions (Fig.\u00a08) are as follows: the two vertical surfaces at the sides are adiabatic (i.e.,\u00a0the far-field temperature distribution with depth is not affected by the tunnel, and the surface temperature affects the top 15\u00a0m, simulating realistic far-field conditions); the front and rear vertical surfaces are adiabatic; the bottom horizontal surface is set to a constant temperature, \n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n (i.e.,\u00a0the soil temperature); and the ground surface, technical room and tunnel air interfaces are simulated by means of convective boundary conditions (i.e.,\u00a0flux conditions, \n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n), setting a coefficient for convective heat transfer, \n\n\nh\n\n\ni\n\n\n, and an air temperature, \n\n\nT\n\n\ni\n\n\n, based on experimental results. \n\n\nh\n\n\ni\n\n\n is linked to the air velocity and is calibrated following the available correlations.\n35\u201339\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\ni\n\n\n was chosen as \n\n\n\nh\n\n\ng\ns\n\n\n=\n10\n\n W\/m2\/K, \n\n\n\nh\n\n\nt\nr\n\n\n=\n3\n\n W\/m2\/K, and \n\n\n\nh\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n4\n\n W\/m2\/K for the ground surface, technical room and tunnel, respectively; the first coefficient represented a wind velocity of approximately \n\n1\n\nm\/s\n\n, and the latter coefficients represented a \u201cquasi-zero\u201d wind velocity. \n\n\nT\n\n\ni\n\n\n are transient functions set as in Table\u00a02. The mechanical boundaries are as follows: the base boundary is fixed, and all the vertical boundaries are rollers, while the remaining boundaries are free (Fig.\u00a08). The nonisothermal fluid flow in the HE is simulated by imposing the experimental time history of fluid inflow temperature and velocity, while the outflow fluid temperature is used to calibrate the model with respect to the experimental results. The solver accounts for a temperature initialization phase of 10\u00a0years duration to ensure that the result is independent of the model initial condition, followed by simulating the experimental tests. During such period, the periodic thermal boundary conditions (Table\u00a02) are applied so that to obtain a realistic temperature initialization before the start of geothermal operations. Further outcomes on this aspect are reported in Section\u00a04.3.\n\n\n4.2\nTRT\nThe objectives of numerical modeling are to interpret the experimental results, giving a full picture of the hydrothermal aspects involved in UEI operation. The TRT is usually employed in geothermal applications\n10\n\n,\n\n12\n\n,\n\n20\n\n,\n\n35\n\n,\n\n36\n\n,\n\n40\n\n,\n\n41\n to thermally characterize the materials surrounding a thermoactive element (e.g.,\u00a0borehole, pile), determining (i) the undisturbed soil temperature and (ii) the average thermal conductivity of the soil. Numerical techniques are adopted instead of, for example, analytical and\/or semianalytical techniques for addressing these challenges because of the geometrical complexities and the highly transient thermal behavior of the UEI and its boundary conditions (Fig.\u00a03, Table\u00a02).\nThe undisturbed soil temperature, \n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n, is varied to obtain an average temperature in the HEs equal to that measured by the TRT module during the water circulation phase. This correspondence occurs for \n\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n14\n.\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC, which is consistent with the expected values for the European climate. Before the start of the heating phase of the TRT, the average fluid temperature is \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\nn\nu\nm\n\n\n=\n17\n.\n30\n\n\u00b0\n\nC, which is very close to the experimental value, \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ne\nx\np\n\n\n=\n17\n.\n34\n\n\n (Fig.\u00a05).\nThe estimate of the thermal characteristics of the involved materials (i.e.,\u00a0soil and concrete) represents the second objective. To do so, an issue related to the unicity of the solution exists: it is impossible to uniquely determine the thermal conductivity of soil and concrete while having only one experimental result. Concrete thermal conductivity could realistically vary between \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n1\n.\n0\n\u00f7\n2\n.\n0\n\n\n\nW\/m\/K\n.\n35\n\n,\n\n36\n\n,\n\n42\u201344\n Soil thermal conductivity (i.e.,\u00a0normally consolidated clay and slightly overconsolidated clay in saturated conditions) could realistically be evaluated as \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n1\n.\n0\n\u00f7\n2\n.\n5\n\n\n\nW\/m\/K\n.\n1\n\n,\n\n45\n\n\nDedicated parametric studies are run to detect the impact of thermal capacity of soil and concrete in reproducing the experimental results. Thermal capacity plays a role during the transient phase of the TRT heating, which lasts approximately 2 days (Fig.\u00a05). Then, the process is driven by thermal conductivity as a steady-flux condition is reached. Such analyses highlighted that very marginal effects are played by thermal capacity of concrete and soil. For such reasons, thermal capacity and density are fixed to \n\nC\n\n\np\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n850\n\n J\/kg\/K, \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n2722\n\n kg\/m3, \n\nC\n\n\np\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n1000\n\n J\/kg\/K, and \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n2011\n\n kg\/m3 for concrete and soil, respectively.\n1\n\n,\n\n35\n\n,\n\n36\n\n,\n\n41\n\n,\n\n45\n A sensitivity analysis of thermal capacity effects was performed, showing little variation in the UEI thermal performance. Concrete thermal conductivity was fixed to different values, and soil thermal conductivity was evaluated to best match the experimental results (Table\u00a03). The comparison between the experimental and numerical results was performed at the outflow fluid temperature, \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\no\nu\nt\n\n\n, which is not an input parameter of the numerical model. The error is evaluated as \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\no\nu\nt\n,\nn\nu\nm\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\no\nu\nt\n,\ne\nx\np\n\n\n\n, as reported in Table\u00a03. In the following, the numerical results for \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n1\n.\n7\n\n\n\nW\/m\/K\n and \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n1\n.\n4\n\n\n\nW\/m\/K\n are reported, as they represent the best fitting to the experimental results. Close agreement between the experimental and numerical results is reported in Fig.\u00a05.\n\nAdditionally, numerical analyses give a broader view of the thermal response of the UEI during TRT execution, with emphasis on (i) the temperature profile of the materials upon heating, (ii) heat fluxes and (iv) intrados tunnel temperature.\nAt the beginning of the heating phase, the soil is strongly affected by thermal exchanges because of the vicinity of the HE: consequently, the heat exchanger-soil heat flux (i.e.,\u00a0extrados) slightly decreases with time due to heat propagation in the soil and the increase in the soil volume affected by temperature variations. The extrados heat flux range is between \n\n25\n\u00f7\n35\n\n W\/m2 (Fig.\u00a09). At the end of the test, the model suggests that a soil portion of thickness 1.5\u00a0m around the EW is affected by a temperature variation of \n\n>\n1\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n with respect to its initial temperature distribution.\nThe temperature distribution inside the concrete geostructure evolves with time. At the beginning of heating and during a portion of the transient condition, the intrados temperature is higher than that of the HCF. It follows that the heat flux is directed from the tunnel toward the HCF. The tunnel, in this phase, acts as a thermal resistance rather than as a conductor (Fig.\u00a09), where a positive heat flux denotes a flux vector directed toward the positive \nx\n-axis (i.e.,\u00a0from the wall toward the soil). The tunnel is located between \n\nz\n=\n\u2212\n7\n.\n5\n\n m and \n\nz\n=\n\u2212\n14\n\n m, and a positive heat flux with a magnitude of approximately \n\n+\n7\n.\n5\n\n W\/m2 is recorded. When the HCF temperature increases, it becomes higher than that of the tunnel, hence reversing the heat flux. It reaches its stationary condition at approximately \n\n\u2212\n10\n\n W\/m2. The heat fluxes are hence dominated by the extrados component, which is \n\n3\n\u00f7\n5\n\n times higher than the intrados component.\n\nThermal photos at level -2 were taken on the last day of testing and compared with the numerical results, showing close agreement (complementary results are available in Ref.\u00a021). The longitudinal thickness of the intrados thermally affected zone is 2.5\u00a0m. The intrados temperature varied between \n\n20\n\u00f7\n22\n\n\u00b0\n\nC on \n\n21\n\/\n08\n\/\n2019\n\n and between \n\n20\n\u00f7\n23\n\n\u00b0\n\nC on 29\/08\/2019. It follows that the temperature distribution inside the wall is nonuniform: it shows a maximum located near the HCF. The temperature decreases until reaching a minimum at the wall\u2013tunnel interface.\n\n\n4.3\nHeat pump tests\nThe heat pump tests are numerically simulated using the same model presented above. Inflow temperature is imposed as the average monitored \n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n,\ni\nn\n\n\n, while the outflow temperature is used for comparison among the numerical and experimental results. To reduce the computational cost, the numerical model cannot capture each HP cycle, but the average inflow and outflow temperatures are in close agreement with the experimental results for the heating (Fig.\u00a06(a)) and cooling (Fig.\u00a06(b)) tests.\nBefore analyzing the details of the wall\u2013tunnel interactions during the thermal activation tests, it is worth analyzing the UEI-tunnel interactions induced by the application of boundary conditions only. As reported in Table\u00a02, the temperature profiles at the boundaries present yearly periodic behaviors. These conditions have implications on the UEI operation, as they modify the temperature profile of the UEI itself and its surroundings. A portion of the wall and soil undergoes a seasonal temperature variation of \n\n\u0394\nT\n\u2245\n6\n\u00f7\n10\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n\n (Fig.\u00a010). The concrete presents maximum\/minimum temperatures of \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n19\n\u00f7\n9\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n during summer and winter. The soil (i.e.,\u00a0the portion within the dashed gray lines reported in Fig.\u00a010) presents \n\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n17\n\u00f7\n11\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n during summer and winter. These temperature variations must be considered when studying UEI operation for two reasons. First, temperature variations induced by natural effects on the order of magnitude of several degrees Celsius may affect the validity of the hypothesis of \u201cyearly constant soil temperature\u201d, which is often applied to energy geostructures.\n1\n Second, Fig.\u00a010 shows that the portion of materials that undergoes these temperature variations represents more than \n\n50\n%\n\n of the volume of the most thermally affected materials during UEI operation. It follows that these environmental temperature variations will affect the UEI operation, as the tunnel heats the materials during summer and cools them during winter, reducing the seasonal potential for heat injection and extraction, respectively. This reduction is already partly apparent in the HP results for the cooling test (Section\u00a03.3.2), as the heat pump must periodically stop to allow for thermal recharge before resuming its operation. This effect is detrimental to winter operation: a reduction in the average temperature of materials reduces the potential for cooling the UEI, as the allowable operative temperature range is already limited from most operative prescriptions and available standards.\n15\n\n,\n\n46\n\n,\n\n47\n\n\n\nAnalyses of the hydrothermal behavior during heating and cooling tests are reported here. Upon heating, the maximum portion of materials affected by thermal effects extends up to \n\n2\n\nm\n\n of soil laterally to the UEI. The maximum wall temperature is \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nw\n,\nm\na\nx\n\n\n=\n38\n.\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The magnitude of the intrados heat fluxes is transient. The wall and tunnel act as conductors, with the heat flux magnitude increasing as the heating persists. The extrados heat flux strongly dominates the intrados heat flux (Fig.\u00a011(a)). The heat flux at the extrados is slightly higher for the top portion of the wall (i.e.,\u00a0facing the tunnel level) than for the bottom portion because the initial soil temperature is lower. The magnitude of the heat flux at the extrados is thrice that at the intrados.\nUpon cooling, the portion of materials affected by thermal effects extends up to \n\n1\n\u00f7\n1\n.\n5\n\nm\n\n of soil laterally to the UEI, with the portion of soil affected by thermal effects increasing in volume as the cooling persists. The minimum wall temperature is \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nw\n,\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n4\n.\n3\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. The heat flux at the extrados is higher in the fully embedded portion of the wall that at the top part, contributing to the higher temperature difference between the soil and the HCF (Fig.\u00a011(b)). The magnitude of the heat flux at the extrados is fivefold higher than that at the intrados.\n\nThe wall intrados is affected by temperature variations induced by the thermal activation of the UEI. Comparisons between experimental (i.e.,\u00a0thermal photos) and numerical results showed close agreement (complementary results are available in Ref.\u00a021). Upon heating, the longitudinal extent of the intrados\u2019 thermally affected region was \n\n2\n.\n5\n\nm\n\n. The average temperature difference between the thermally affected and undisturbed portions was \n\n3\n.\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. Upon cooling, the longitudinal extent of the thermally affected portion was \n\n1\n\nm\n\n. The average temperature difference between the thermally affected and undisturbed regions was \n\n\u2212\n1\n.\n5\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n. Close agreement between the experimental and numerical results was found.\n21\n\n\n\n\n4.4\nPreliminary guidelines for TRT execution and data interpretation for underground thermoactive infrastructures\nThis section discusses the details of the execution of TRTs applied to UEIs and, more generally, to any geostructure partly in contact with an air interface. To our knowledge, no literature on this topic is available. Moreover, no feedback, execution manuals or legislative standards for test execution or data interpretation are available.\nTRT-type heating input was extensively used to determine the soil thermal characteristics for vertical HEs\n16\n\n,\n\n18\n and energy piles and to detect the thermomechanical behavior of energy geostructures.\n6\n\n,\n\n23\n\n,\n\n48\u201350\n Consequently, the first challenge was to understand what knowledge the execution of TRT on UEIs could bring, knowing that the focus should be on determining the thermal behavior and potential of the UEI. On the basis of the foregoing presented results, the main feedbacks are reported here.\nFirst, one should verify that the following criteria are fulfilled when performing the test: (i) the fluid circulation phase should last long enough so that possible day\/night fluid temperature variations are recorded; (ii) the heating phase should last long enough so that the steady state condition within the HE is successfully reached. In this regard, the typical heating duration used for vertical HEs (i.e.,\u00a0one week) should be taken as a lower boundary. The longer and\/or the more complex the heat exchanger circuit is, the longer the heating phase should be to ensure that it reaches the steady state. Additionally, the stronger the hydrothermal interactions with neighboring environments (e.g.,\u00a0air interfaces) are, the longer the time needed to reach steady state conditions is. (iii) The interpretation of the results requires a detailed, time-dependent knowledge of the thermal environment characterization near the UEI. The definition of the initial temperature profile within and around the UEI is crucial. (iv) If the thermal environments around the UEI are not known with sufficient accuracy, the installation and use of a dedicated in situ monitoring system is strongly advised. (v) The interpretation of the results should account for all relevant heat exchange modes occurring within and around the UEI. Consequently, the use of numerical models seems to be the most accurate tool in view of the presence of geometric complexities. Attempts to determine the soil thermal conductivity using analytical models\n16\n\n,\n\n51\n were made in the case presented in this study. The multiple, concurrent, thermal processes lead to a complex definition of the heat fluxes direction, and make the assumptions of the simplified analytical models unsuitable for the analysis of the geometry in question (e.g.,\u00a0infinite line source, cylindrical source method, etc\u2026). Thus, there is a need to employ modeling techniques allowing for a detailed understanding of such heat exchanges. Numerical modeling (FEM) is a suitable choice.\nFinally, it can be concluded that this in situ test allows for replying to the challenge of determining the thermal characteristics of the involved materials if a correct assessment and monitoring (where needed) of the relevant boundary conditions is thoroughly performed.\n\n\n\n5\nThermomechanical behavior\nThe temperature variations to which the wall is subjected during heating\/cooling tests induce thermomechanical effects in the geostructure. Given that the EW is in contact with different materials (i.e.,\u00a0concrete slabs, soil, air), different local behaviors are expected at different locations. The contact with solid materials partly constrains thermally induced deformations (i.e.,\u00a0low degree of freedom, \n\nD\nO\nF\n\n,\n21\n\n,\n\n33\n\n,\n\n52\n\n,\n\n53\n while at the air interface, the UEI has more freedom to deform (i.e.,\u00a0higher \n\nD\nO\nF\n\n). On the basis of the experimental and numerical results (see Appendix\u00a0A for the model details), two temperature profiles in the EW are detected. At the top portion, the presence of air helps maintain a low temperature variation at the intrados. The air \u201cwashes away\u201d the temperature difference imposed by the HEs. It follows that the EW temperature variation distribution is strongly nonuniform, with an absolute maximum located at the wall-soil interface and a minimum at the intrados. At the bottom, in the fully embedded portion, a less pronounced nonuniform temperature profile is numerically recorded as a consequence of the nonsymmetrical HE location (Fig.\u00a012).\n\nThe monitoring system detailed in Section\u00a02.2 is used here to evaluate the wall intrados mechanical behavior during the in situ tests. This monitoring system can record the axial deformation of the instruments, which are installed alternatively in vertical and longitudinal arrangements at the wall intrados of level -2 (Fig.\u00a02). The results are reported in Fig.\u00a013. The geostructure deforms when subjected to thermal loads. Deformations are partly restrained by the soil and the structural connections. The experimental results suggest that two distinct mechanisms can be identified: vertical and longitudinal mechanisms.\nThe temperature variation throughout the EW cross section is nonuniform (Fig.\u00a012). Longitudinally, temperature diffuses (radially from the HEs) in the wall from the vicinity of the HE toward the intrados and toward the soil. Upon heating, the EW extrados tend to longitudinally dilate, but this dilation is partly blocked by the soil. Longitudinally, the only constraint to dilation is represented by the soil, and no wall\u2013slab connections affect the EW behavior at any longitudinal cross section at level -2. It follows that dilation at the extrados is partly blocked, but following intrados heating, the intrados is free to dilate (\n\nD\nO\n\n\nF\n\n\ni\nn\nt\nr\na\nd\no\ns\n\n\n>\nD\nO\n\n\nF\n\n\ne\nx\nt\nr\na\nd\no\ns\n\n\n\n). For this reason, positive (i.e.,\u00a0expansion) longitudinal deformation values are attained. The maximum longitudinal deformation is recorded at the tunnel mid-height, where the wall presents the lowest degree of freedom. The maximum recorded deformation value corresponds to \n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\nh\n,\nm\na\nx\n\n\n=\n\u0394\nL\n\/\n\n\nL\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n013\n%\n\n. The deformation profile is not instantaneous, but it develops with time, in agreement with the time-dependent thermal diffusion inside the EW. The opposite was recorded upon cooling (Fig.\u00a013).\nUpon heating, the EW extrados tend to vertically dilate, but this dilation is partly blocked by the constraints (i.e.,\u00a0soil and structural connections). During heating tests, the extrados is hotter than the intrados (Fig.\u00a012). Treating the EW as a vertical beam and following the hypothesis that, for small deformations, the beam cross section maintains its planarity and remains orthogonal to the neutral axis (Euler\u2013Bernoulli theory of beams\n54\n), the extrados tend to vertically dilate and the intrados tend to contract (Fig.\u00a013). Additionally, structural constraints at the top and bottom of level -2 (i.e.,\u00a0wall\u2013slab connection and additional stiffness offered by the embedded portion of the wall, wall\u2013slab connection and self-weight of the superstructure at the top) considerably restrain the degree of freedom of the wall. It follows that vertical intrados deformations are quasi-null, with a tendency of being negative (i.e.,\u00a0contractive) following the extrados expansion toward the soil side. The contraction is maximum at the location of the highest \n\nD\nO\nF\n\n at the mid-height of the wall facing the tunnel. During heating, the EW intrados vertically deforms, exhibiting a contraction. The opposite is recorded upon cooling (Fig.\u00a013).\n\nThese results allow for a qualitative representation of the thermomechanical behavior of the EW. The experimental setup used here cannot capture a quantitative and exhaustive definition of the thermomechanical wall behavior because of constraints for the sensor\u2019s installation (i.e.,\u00a0a monitoring system could not be installed at the extrados). The results reported in the present study are consistent with those reported on an energy piled wall in Vienna by \n9\n, which show maximum seasonal relative strains up to \n\n200\n\u03bc\n\u03b5\n\n, located toward the mid-height of the underground tunnel. However, limited details are available in\n9\n on the experimental setup, making any attempt at a more detailed comparison difficult.\nTo estimate the intensity of internal actions and to check the mechanical stability of the UEI, a detailed comparison accounting for thermal and mechanical load combinations is performed through 3D finite element thermohydromechanical numerical analyses. A comparison among the experimental and numerical results is first performed accounting only for thermal loads by simulating the heating and cooling tests. The results of this comparison, referring to the tunnel intrados deformations, are reported in Fig.\u00a014 and show close agreement.\n\nSecond, a series of numerical analyses is performed, focusing on analyzing all possible ultimate (ULS) and serviceability (SLS) limit states accounting for simultaneous thermal and mechanical actions in accordance with the Swiss norm.\n55\u201358\n Along with geothermal operation and following the design details of the UEI, additional mechanical loads are included. Details are reported in Appendix\u00a0B.\n\nFig.\u00a015 and Fig.\u00a016 show the results for the EW axial displacements and internal actions evaluated at the cross section in correspondence with the HEs. The vertical behavior of the EW is driven by the settlement (i.e.,\u00a0negative displacement) induced by applying mechanical actions. During heating, the EW partly expands, reducing its overall settlement. The null point\n52\n\n,\n\n59\n is located at the fully embedded portion near the EW toe. The opposite was recorded upon cooling. Thermal actions have a primary role in defining transversal (i.e.,\u00a0horizontal) displacements, consequently to the bending effects induced by the nonuniform temperature distribution. The recorded values largely respect the maximum acceptable limits defined by the Swiss norm (i.e.,\u00a0\n\n20\n\n mm for this geometry).\nInternal actions follow the general behavior defined by the mechanical load application, with major variations located at the wall\u2013slabconnections due to structural stress redistribution within the structure, particularly for axial force and shear force. The bending moment shows larger discrepancies between the isothermal and nonisothermal cases. A positive bending moment (Fig.\u00a016) upon heating means that traction develops at the intrados, while contraction develops at the extrados due to the blocked portion of thermal expansion during heating (i.e.,\u00a0summer operation). The opposite was recorded during cooling (i.e.,\u00a0winter operation). The maximum capacity of the structure (i.e.,\u00a0resistance bending moment, shear force, axial force) is respected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nConcluding remarks\nThis study presents the results from an experimental campaign on a full-scale underground energy infrastructure (i.e.,\u00a0an underground railway station) and the related numerical modeling. The main concluding remarks related to its THM behavior are summarized as follows.\nThe wall\u2013tunnel hydrothermal interactions show a strong correlation between the tunnel temperature and external temperature, with high seasonal temperature variations. A relatively low speed, low scatter wind speed profile, compared with measurements on existing tunnels available in the literature,\n60\u201366\n was recorded. Low-magnitude wind speed induces low convective heat exchanges and hence low heat flux at the wall\u2013tunnel interface. Additionally, the presence of a glass wall in the tunnel dramatically reduces the wind velocity profile near the EW, highlighting the boundary layer of the wind at the wall\u2013tunnel interface. Thus, the tunnel, under certain circumstances, may act as a thermal resistance rather than as a conductor.\nHigh seasonal temperature variations at the boundary conditions induce nonnegligible yearly temperature variations within the UEI. This is because the UEI is located at the thermal and hydrodynamic\n1\n\n,\n\n39\n entrance regions of the tunnel.\nThe UEI shows a very high heat storage potential (i.e.,\u00a0summer operation). The key aspects that highlight the heat storage potential are as follows: (i) the predominant heat exchange mechanism is conduction in the wall and in the soil, with absence of groundwater flow in the soil; (ii) the low heat flux magnitude at the wall intrados minimizes heat losses toward the tunnel, which acts as a natural insulator; and (iii) the high capacity of storing heat develops high HCF temperature differences between the inflow and outlet during heating tests.\nDuring winter operation (i.e.,\u00a0EW cooling), the UEI has a limited operative HCF temperature range. The use of glycolyzed fluids to replace water is strongly suggested for future operations, as it would allow HCF temperatures to be reached \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n<\n0\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n, avoiding freezing issues within the HP and surroundings and consequently increasing the thermal potential.\nFrom a thermomechanical perspective, the UEI is very stiff. It can hence undergo high internal actions while mobilizing little displacement (i.e.,\u00a0high mechanical capacity). The design limits are successfully respected.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJacopo Zannin: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Data curation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization, Project administration.

Drilling a well through various strata introduces a risk of fluid communication between different formations and upward migration of substances. This can ultimately lead to the contamination of the subsurface water sources or leakage of fluids to surface.(1; 2) To mitigate the risk of leaks, well designs usually consist of several cemented steel casings placed in the wellbore at several depths, with multiple casings that partly overlap at shallow depths. The casings are cemented in place by pumping cement slurry through the casing which subsequently flows through the annular space between overlapping casings or between the casing and rock formations. Once the cement is cured and set, it acts as a barrier to flow in the annulus, ensuring zonal isolation of the well.\nIt is critical to ensure the integrity of the annular cement over the entire operational lifetime of the well, as well as after decommissioning of the well. Best practice approaches include ensuring appropriate type of cement and cementation procedures are used given the expected downhole conditions of pressure, temperature, and the chemical environment.(3) Subsequent well operations can also damage the cement by causing expansion or contraction of the casing resulting from changes in temperature or pressure during injection or production.(4) Well integrity issues caused by well operations is of particular interest for energy storage, geothermal energy, and carbon sequestration projects, particularly when re-using old oil and gas wells.(5; 6; 7; 8; 9) A poorly placed and damaged cement sheath can create a permeable zone around the casing that allows fluids to move upwards or downwards. Cement damage may also expose the casing to chemically reactive downhole fluids, which may promote casing corrosion and degradation.(10) Mitigation of well leakage is generally difficult and expensive. Therefore, it is critical to assess the well conditions that can lead to cement damage and the resulting rate of fluid leakage upfront. If incorporated in well design, such assessments can help de-risking well operations based on project-specific well integrity analysis.\nThere are several types of cement failure that could occur under downhole conditions. High pressures inside the casing can change the tangential stress in cement from compression to tensile, leading to radial cracks.(11) Cement can also fail in shear at high deviatoric stresses (12; 13) or due to heating or cooling of the well.(14; 15) Differential axial displacement between formation, casing, and cement (e.g.\u00a0due to shrinkage) can lead to disking (flat horizontal cracks across the cement). Additionally, the cement sheath can debond from the casing or the formation, leading to the creation of microannuli.(16; 17) A microannulus can be formed by casing contraction due to cold fluid injection, such as CO2, and by a drop in casing pressure.(18; 17) Cement hydration and high formation pressure have also been proposed as causes of microannulus formation.(19; 13)\nThere is a long history of model development to predict failure in cement sheaths. Thiercelin et al.\n20\n developed an analytical model to investigate cement failure in wellbores. Bosma et al.\n21\n presented a finite element model to study various loading scenarios. They also investigated the impact of different initial stress assumptions on the cement sheath integrity calculations. Their results indicated that cement\u2019s elastic properties are important design parameters to reduce the risk of cement failure under in-situ conditions. Gray et al.\n22\n provided a review of the finite element models in the literature, and emphasized the need for modelling the entire load history of the well. Bois et al.\n4\n proposed the use of a mechanistic model that simulates the hydration process of cement. Their model was used to predict various types of cement failure and the results were verified using lab experiments. Lavrov\n23\n conducted a numerical study to investigate the conditions that could lead to the debonding of casing and cement. They concluded that the impact of thermal stresses can be reduced by adjusting the stiffness of the cement with respect to the stiffness of the formation. Orlic et al.\n9\n investigated the impact of well history on the formation of the microannulus. Roy et al.\n17\n studied the impact of thermal stress on cement integrity using numerical simulations and concluded that presence of sufficient in-situ stresses can mitigate the impact of the microannulus. Frash and Carey\n24\n developed analytical and numerical schemes to study the impact of reservoir uplift on the shear integrity of the cement sheath. Zhang and Eckert\n25\n incorporated the impact of cement pore pressure and stiffness development in a staged finite element model. Numerical models are important tools in studying the annular cement integrity. However, models should be verified using laboratory experiments or well logs to ensure their accuracy in predicting loss of cement integrity.\nGoodwin and Crook\n26\n conducted laboratory experiments on the integrity of cement placed in the annular area between two casings. They measured the evolution of annular permeability under various pressure cycles. Jackson and Murphey\n27\n used a similar setup to test different pressure cycles and well configurations. These experiments indicated that at high inner casing pressures, no permeability was observed. However, as the pressure was dropped significant permeability was created in the annular region. This indicated plastic deformation at high casing pressures which lead to debonding as pressure is dropped.(13) Boukhelifa et al.\n28\n used an apparatus capable of mechanically expanding and contracting the casing to study the impact of casing deformation on the integrity of annular cement. They tested various cement formulations and concluded that the use of more flexible cements can prevent debonding. Therond et al.\n29\n used a large-scale setup to study the impact of pressure and temperature cycles on cement integrity. A postmortem analysis of their samples indicated the presence of radial cracks, disking, and microannuli. They concluded that the formation of microannuli has the biggest impact on the annular permeability. Radial cracks showed significantly lower permeability in their experiments. De\u00a0Andrade et al.\n30\n developed an experimental setup to investigate cement failure under various loading conditions using X-ray computed tomography. The new experimental setup allowed for 3D visualization of radial cracks and microannuli.(11) Stormont et al.\n31\n conducted a comprehensive set of tests on microannulus aperture under various confining stress and casing pressures. The measured apertures in their work ranged between 0.\n\n6\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n (for the intact cement) and \n\n60\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n, for the majority of the tests. Their results show that microannuli could allow high permeability channels to form. Although casing pressure can close the microannulus to some degree, a residual permeability always seems to exist. Welch et al.\n32\n used a triaxial direct shear setup to measure the cohesion and friction angle of the cement\u2013steel interface. Their results showed little change in the interface permeability due to shear displacement.\nThe permeability of the damaged cement is a critical parameter, as it determines the rate of fluid migration along the wellbore. A cement sheath with high permeability induced by fractures or debonding could ultimately lead to contamination of shallow water sources if fluid pathways connect over large parts of the well.(33) Also, lack of zonal isolation over large well sections can lead to emission of greenhouse gases such as methane into the atmosphere,(34) or can jeopardize the seal quality of CO2 storage sites.(16) Formation of continuous microannuli due to debonding of the casing\u2013cement interface could lead to permeable pathways between casing and cement.(29; 31)\nDifferential sliding between the casing and the cement can lead to shear displacement along the casing\u2013cement interface. This could also lead to a change in the microannulus aperture, which is not as clearly understood as debonding. Hydro-mechanical properties of the microannulus are needed to correctly assess the severity of leakage in the annular region. These parameters are critical inputs in models to estimate the aperture and permeability evolution of microannuli over the well\u2019s history. While there are studies in the literature that measure hydraulic aperture change with casing pressure (31) and shear displacement, (32) they are conducted on small samples that fit in a typical triaxial cell. Large-scale tests that more closely represent the wellbore geometry are still scarce.\nIn this study, we used lab experiments and numerical modelling to assess microannuli development at casing\u2013cement interfaces. We conducted flow experiments on two-metre long samples that consist of a 7\u201d casing and annular cement. Hydraulic aperture of the microannuli was calculated from the flow data at various casing pressures, and after axially displacing the casing through the annular cement. We developed a numerical model to calculate the mechanical aperture of the microannulus under conditions similar to the laboratory experiments. Using the experimental and modelling results, we propose a new relationship between the mechanical and hydraulic apertures for casing\u2013cement microannuli. We compared the experimental results to surface leakage measurements at abandoned oil and gas well sites, collected from several studies in the literature, to evaluate the apertures and associated leakage rates of the microannuli against actual field measurements.\nThe results provide estimates of the hydraulic properties of microannuli in well systems at realistic spatial scales, which are critical for reliable modelling of well leakage. In addition, the experimental results on the large-scale samples provide benchmark data for hydraulic aperture and leakage that can be used to verify numerical models and to better understand the mechanisms controlling the opening and closure of microannuli. This work attempts to fill the existing gaps between the numerical modelling, laboratory experiments, and field-scale measurements of fluid leakage in wells. It enables more accurately forecasts of the conditions for loss of zonal isolation and quantifies possible well leakage rates for a wide range of geological and operational conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nApproach\n\n2.1\nMicroannulus aperture\nIn this study, a microannulus is treated as a distinct fracture with a mean aperture. Conventional cubic law for fluid flow along fractures can then be used to relate the aperture of the microannulus to permeability and flow rate.(35) Eq.\u00a0(1) shows the relationship between the flow rate and the aperture of the microannulus for an incompressible fluid.(36) \n\n(1)\n\n\nQ\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n\u03bc\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n in Eq.\u00a0(1) is the flow rate, \n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n is the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus, \n\n\nx\n\n\na\n\n\n is the circumference of the microannulus, \n\n\u0394\nP\n\n is the pressure difference across the microannulus, \n\u03bc\n and \nL\n are fluid viscosity and length of the annulus, respectively.\nGeomechanical models are generally capable of calculating the aperture change due to a change in loading conditions.(9; 37; 18) However, these models calculate the mechanical aperture of the microannulus. Hydraulic aperture of the microannulus is required to calculate leakage rates using Eq.\u00a0(1). Hydraulic aperture of a fracture is typically lower than the mechanical aperture due to the roughness of the fracture faces and the tortuosity of flow paths.(38) Several studies have proposed correlations to calculate the hydraulic aperture of a single fracture using the mechanical aperture and some form of roughness coefficients.(39; 40; 41) However, the relationship between the hydraulic and mechanical apertures of cement microannuli is largely unknown. Understanding this relationship is paramount in filling the gap between predictions of the geomechanical models and fluid leakage calculations. A new relationship between the hydraulic and mechanical aperture of microannuli is proposed in the discussion section.\n\n\n2.2\nExperimental design\n\n2.2.1\nSample and setup description\nThe samples in this work consisted of a two-metre long steel shell with an inner diameter of 355.4\u00a0mm (14\u201d). The shell was ordered from a commercial company and included a cement (Gouda Vuurvast, uniaxial compressive strength of 37 MPa) already casted inside with a 200\u00a0mm hole to fit a smaller casing. The cement in the shell was intended to simulate the formation. The formation cement was stiffer and stronger than the annular cement used in this study. A standard casing with an outer diameter of 177.8\u00a0mm (7\u201d) was placed and centred in the hole of the formation cement. Water was injected into the casing to raise the inner pressure to 20 MPa. A cement slurry was created by mixing class G Portland cement with water with a ratio of 0.4 w\/c. The cement slurry was mixed at 7000 rpm until it was smooth.(42) The slurry was then pumped into the annular space between the casing and the formation cement, using a membrane pump. The cement was cured for approximately seven days at 0.3 MPa pressure and room temperature. The curing pressure was applied using a nitrogen cushion at the top of the cement. During the curing period, the inner casing pressure was maintained at 20 MPa. Subsequently, the casing pressure was dropped to zero to create a microannulus at the casing\u2013cement\u200b interface.\nTo conduct the experiments, the samples were placed vertically in a load-frame capable of exerting an axial load up to 140 metric tons on the casing. In addition, the setup was capable of controlling the fluid pressure inside the casing. To measure the hydraulic aperture, tap water was pumped through the bottom of the annulus at a constant rate between 7.5 to 150 ml\/min using a H3 metring pump until the inlet pressure stabilized (between 0.2 to 5 MPa, accurate to \n\u00b1\n0.1%). The top of the annulus was open to the atmosphere. The flow rate was measured at the pump and using an automatic scale at the downstream, with an accuracy of \n\u00b1\n0.25%. Hydraulic aperture was calculated using Eq.\u00a0(1) using the measured flow rate and upstream pressure. The viscosity of water was assumed to be 0.9 cp. Each measurement of the hydraulic aperture took 15 to 30\u00a0min until the flow stabilized. Fig.\u00a01 shows details of the setup and samples. In this study, two samples were created to investigate the impact of casing pressure change, and axial displacement of the casing on the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus. All experiments have been conducted at the Rijswijk Centre for Sustainable Geoenergy (RCSG) in the Netherlands. A brief description of the experimental setup and the preliminary results are also reported by Moghadam et al.\n43\n.\n\n\n2.2.2\nCasing pressure experiments\nIn the first set of experiments, we investigated the impact of casing pressure (ballooning) on the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus (Fig.\u00a02). The sample was prepared as described in the previous section. A microannulus was formed by dropping the casing pressure from an initial value of 20 MPa during curing, to zero (gauge pressure). Water flow was then established at a constant rate in the annular region to measure the hydraulic aperture, using Eq.\u00a0(1). For each measurement, we recorded the flow rate and the upstream annular pressure after the flow was stabilized (no pressure change for 15 to 30\u00a0min). The inner casing pressure was then raised, and another flow test was conducted to quantify the impact of casing pressure on the aperture of the microannulus. The casing pressure was gradually increased to 40 MPa with hydraulic aperture being measured at each step. The casing pressure was then dropped in several steps back to the atmospheric pressure, while measuring the hydraulic aperture during the unloading stage. The casing pressure was cycled three times. The annular flow rate was changed for each cycle to investigate its impact on the hydraulic aperture.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3\nAxial displacement experiments\nThe second sample in this work was used to study the impact of axial movement of casing on the microannulus (Fig.\u00a02). After the sample preparation and the creation of a microannulus, the casing pressure was set back to 20 MPa and the hydraulic aperture was measured at two different flow rates (i.e.\u00a0upstream pressures). An axial load was then applied at the top of the casing using a load frame, while maintaining a 20 MPa pressure inside the casing. The load increased gradually until the casing was displaced uncontrollably, indicating shear failure at the casing\u2013cement interface. The casing was axially loaded again to measure the hydraulic aperture after another displacement. The casing was displaced 7 times in total for this experiment. Fig.\u00a02 illustrates a schematic of the setup for both experiments.\n\n\n2.2.4\nTest overview\n\nTable\u00a01 summarizes all the tests conducted in this work. Each test includes several hydraulic aperture measurements. The experiments will be referred to by their test ID, in the rest of the paper. Table\u00a01 also provides a short description for each test and indicates the figure numbers that display the main data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\nNumerical modelling\nThe commercial finite element package Abaqus (44) was used to model the microannulus aperture change for the casing pressure experiments. The geometry of the sample was represented by a 2D plane strain model as shown in Fig.\u00a03.\n\nStandard steel properties were used for the outer shell and the casing. The cement properties were taken from the laboratory experiments on class G Portland cement in the literature (45). The properties of the formation cement were supplied by the manufacturer.\n\nTable\u00a02 summarizes the material properties used in the numerical model.\n\nWe modelled the interfaces between the casing, cement, formation, and the outer shell using the surface-to-surface contact discretization method (Abaqus\/Standard User\u2019s Manual, 2019). This formulation allowed us to set the debonding status and the initial aperture of the interfaces, in order to calculate the mechanical aperture of the microannulus with a change in casing pressure. A cohesive contact model was used to simulate the initial bond between the cement and the casing. Once the tensile stresses at the contact exceeded the bond strength, the cohesive bond was eliminated, and the contact surfaces were free to separate. When appropriate, fluid pressure was applied at the microannulus surfaces after debonding. A von Mises failure criterion was used for the casing and the outer shell, while Mohr\u2013Coulomb failure criterion was used for the cement and the rock formation.\nThe simulations followed a similar stress path as the experiments. Initially, the inner casing pressure was set to 20 MPa to mimic the pressure during the cement curing stage in the experiments. The annular space between the casing and the formation analog was set to be empty. The cement was then placed in the annular region at an initial stress equal to the curing pressure (300\u00a0kPa). The cement was assumed to be fully bonded to the casing and the formation (aperture was set to zero at the interfaces). The casing pressure was then dropped to zero, similar to the procedure followed in all our experiments in order to create the initial microannulus. The casing pressure was raised gradually from 0 to 40 MPa, and fluid pressure was applied to the interface, and the aperture, stresses, and displacements in the model were recorded.\nThe model was used to calculate the mechanical aperture at all three interfaces, i.e.\u00a0casing\u2013cement, cement\u2013formation, and formation\u2013shell\u200b interfaces. In all the simulations under the laboratory boundary conditions, all changes in aperture occurred at the casing\u2013cement interface. Therefore, in the rest of this paper we refer to the aperture of the casing\u2013cement interface as the aperture of the microannulus.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nImpact of casing pressure\nThe first sample was used to measure the impact of casing pressure on the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus. Fig.\u00a04 shows the change in the hydraulic aperture with respect to casing pressure. The first load cycle, measured at a constant water flow rate of 7.5 ml\/min, starts at a hydraulic aperture of \n\n26\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n at zero casing pressure. This indicates the initial hydraulic aperture of the microannulus that is formed after curing, as the casing pressure is dropped from 20 MPa to zero (at a stabilized upstream pressure of 300\u00a0kPa). The aperture decreases as the casing pressure increases, due to casing expansion. The aperture drops to \n\n15\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n at 35 MPa during the load cycle. The unloading path in the first cycle indicates similar aperture values as the loading path. During the loading of the second cycle at a flow rate of 60 ml\/min, aperture decreases from \n\n32\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n at 0 MPa to \n\n21\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n at 40 MPa. As the casing pressure is dropped back to 0, aperture returns to the initial value of \n\n32\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. The second load cycle was repeated at the same casing pressure and flow rate. The repeated tests show similar results, which indicates acceptable repeatability of the experiments. The hydraulic aperture during the third cycle at 150 ml\/min flow rate drops from 35 to \n\n29\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n, as the casing pressure increases from 0 to 40 MPa. The unloading path follows the same trend. The tests conducted at higher flow rates (i.e.\u00a0flow pressure) consistently show higher hydraulic apertures. This is due to higher upstream flow pressures needed to maintain a higher flow rate. Table\u00a03 provides a summary of the experimental data for the casing pressure tests.\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a05 shows the numerical results for the mechanical aperture at the casing\u2013cement interface, as the casing pressure is dropped from the initial 20 MPa, during the cement curing, to zero (solid line). According to the results, a microannulus begins to form as the casing pressure reaches 12 MPa. The mechanical aperture of the microannulus increases abruptly to \n\n47\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n when casing pressure is reduced from 12 to 8 MPa. This indicates that the casing\u2013cement interface is fully debonded at 8 MPa. As the casing pressure drops to zero, mechanical aperture increases linearly to \n\n72\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. When the casing is pressurized again, the microannulus closes linearly with increasing casing pressure, until it is fully closed at 20 MPa. The microannulus remains closed as the pressure further rises to 40 MPa. No failure was observed in the cement elements due to the casing pressurization to 40 MPa. In our flow experiments, water at the inlet of the microannulus is at a pressure between 0.2 to 5 MPa, and at the outlet atmospheric pressure is applied. To account for the impact of water pressure on the microannulus opening, the average water pressure for each test is applied to the cement and casing surfaces at the microannulus. Fig.\u00a05 shows the case for an average water pressure of 2 MPa (average of inlet at 4 MPa and outlet at near zero), as the casing is pressurized. A 2 MPa water pressure expands the microannulus from 72 to \n\n94\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n at zero casing pressure. The microannulus stays open until casing pressure reaches 25 MPa.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nImpact of axial displacement\nIn this set of experiments, the casing pressure was held at 20 MPa while the casing was pushed through the annular cement using a load frame. Axial load and casing displacement were recorded. The casing was displaced through the cement seven times in total. Fig.\u00a06 illustrates the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus after repetitive axial casing displacements, at an inner casing pressure of 20 MPa. After each displacement, the hydraulic aperture was measured at flow rates of 60 and 150 ml\/min. According to Fig.\u00a06, hydraulic aperture at 60 ml\/min flow rate slightly increased from 22 to \n\n30\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n after the first two displacements but dropped back to \n\n22\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n after the third displacement. Hydraulic aperture was only measured again after displacement 7, which showed an increase to \n\n25\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. At 150 ml\/min flow rate, the hydraulic aperture was consistently higher, ranging between 29 and \n\n35\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n, and following the same trend with the casing displacements. Each casing displacement changed the aperture within a tight range, but no discernible trend was found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nMechanisms controlling microannulus development\n\n4.1.1\nNormal displacement (debonding)\n\nFig.\u00a05 demonstrates the numerical results of the mechanical aperture opening and closure. As the casing pressure drops, the casing contracts and a microannulus is formed, linearly increasing to a mechanical aperture of \n\n72\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. The increase in the mechanical aperture is equal to the decrease in the casing outer diameter, largely dependent on the casing material\u2019s Young\u2019s modulus. Therefore, in the present experiments and model, casing contraction and expansion largely controls the mechanical size of the microannulus. Once the casing is pressurized again, it expands to its original size and completely closes the microannulus (in the mechanical sense), as the casing is expected to be an elastic material under the test conditions.\nThe behaviour of the hydraulic aperture in the experiments is in some aspects different, as depicted in Fig.\u00a04. As the microannulus is generated by dropping the initial casing pressure to zero, hydraulic aperture increases to a range between 25 and \n\n45\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n, less than the mechanical aperture calculated from the numerical model (\n\n94\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n at 2 MPa average flowing water pressure). As the casing is pressurized again, the hydraulic aperture remains open at a residual value between 15 and \n\n30\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n, while the mechanical aperture fully closes. This behaviour can be attributed to the presence of asperities on the cement\u2019s surface that provide residual leakage flow paths even if the microannulus \nmean\n mechanical aperture is zero. Therefore, hydraulic aperture values measured in our experiments are not equal to the mechanical apertures predicted by the finite element model. Numerical models assume perfectly smooth surfaces. Therefore, their predictions indicate the mean mechanical aperture. The presence of asperities can lead to a standard deviation from the mean value, which leads to open gaps in the fracture that allow fluid flow, i.e.\u00a0a residual hydraulic aperture.\nIn Fig.\u00a04, hydraulic aperture is higher for tests conducted at higher water flow rates. An increase in water rate causes an increase in the average water pressure in the microannulus (Table\u00a03). This leads to further widening of the microannulus. Therefore, the hydraulic aperture is both a function of the casing and microannulus fluid pressure. The impact of fluid pressure is also apparent in the numerical results presented in Fig.\u00a05. During the CP-60-L test, the casing pressure was increased from 0 to 40 MPa. The casing pressure was then dropped to 0 during the CP-60-U test, and re-pressurized again to 40 MPa during CP-60-LR test. The hydraulic aperture was measured at 60 ml\/min water flow rate for all three tests. According to Fig.\u00a04, all three tests show similar hydraulic aperture values indicating the reversibility of hydraulic aperture behaviour with casing pressure during three load\/unload cycles.\n\n\n4.1.2\nShear displacement\n\nFig.\u00a06 shows the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus after each casing displacement measured at 20 MPa casing pressure and two different flow rates. The hydraulic aperture varies between 29 and \n\n35\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n for 150 ml\/min flow rate and between 22 and \n\n30\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n at 60 ml\/min flow rate. The increase in hydraulic aperture with flow rate is indicative of the impact of microannulus pressure. The measurements at each flow rate follow the same trend. However, the hydraulic aperture does not show a trend with the number of casing displacements. We conclude that the axial movement of the casing does not have a major impact on the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus. Shear displacement can increase the fracture permeability (typically in the direction perpendicular to the displacement), if it is accompanied by dilation normal to the fracture face (46). However, the particular geometry and boundary conditions in a wellbore do not allow for normal dilation at the casing\u2013cement interface. In addition, the direction of flow is the same as the shear displacement which makes it less likely to alter the permeability. This explains the small impact of casing displacements on the permeability of the microannulus. The small increase or decrease in hydraulic aperture after each displacement can likely be attributed to changes in the surface roughness of the microannulus arising from the frictional forces between the casing and cement surfaces.\n\n\n\n4.2\nResidual aperture\nThe microannuli never fully closed in our tests, even though casing pressures reached values as high as 40 MPa. Based on Fig.\u00a04, hydraulic apertures of the microannuli reach a relatively constant value at high casing pressures. This likely indicates that there is sufficient roughness between the surfaces of the casing and cement to allow for flow to exist even at high casing pressures. We define the residual aperture as the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus at high casing pressures, when the change in hydraulic aperture with casing pressure becomes negligible (within the range of pressures in this work). Fig.\u00a07 visualizes the residual aperture of the microannulus for the CP-60-L and CP-7.5-L experiments.\n\nResidual apertures in this work were observed to be dependent on the fluid pressure inside the microannulus (Table\u00a03). Once the two faces of the microannulus come into contact, the roughness of the two surfaces will leave a flow path open. This flow path could be envisioned as a compressible porous media. Therefore, the presence of pore pressure inside the microannulus could increase the residual aperture. The residual aperture\u2019s compressibility can then be defined as: \n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\ne\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nP\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating Eq.\u00a0(2), we obtain the following relationship between the residual aperture and fluid pressure: \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nr\n\n\n=\n\n\ne\n\n\ni\n\n\nexp\n\n(\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\nP\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere, \n\n\ne\n\n\nr\n\n\n is the residual aperture, \n\n\ne\n\n\ni\n\n\n is the intrinsic residual aperture (at zero fluid pressure), \n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\n is compressibility, and \nP\n is the fluid pressure in the microannulus. Fig.\u00a08 shows the relationship between the residual aperture and the average fluid pressure for the casing pressure tests (Fig.\u00a04). According to Fig.\u00a08, the intrinsic residual aperture and the compressibility of the microannulus for the first sample are approximately \n\n10\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n, and 0.35 MPa\u22121, respectively.\n\nThe presence of a residual aperture is also supported by other annular flow experiments reported in the literature.(31; 28) Thermally generated microannuli in the study by Stormont et al.\n31\n indicated a residual aperture of approximately \n\n5\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. The experiments reported by Boukhelifa et al.\n28\n showed residual apertures within 5 to \n\n10\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. Both these studies were conducted at low fluid pressures. Therefore, the reported values are indicative of intrinsic residual apertures. The large-scale experiments in this work show an intrinsic residual value of \n\n10\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n which is on the higher end of the small-scale experiments by Stormont et al.\n31\n and Boukhelifa et al.\n28\n\n\nThe intrinsic residual aperture could be correlated with the surface roughness of the cement at the casing\u2013cement interface.(35; 47) Welch et al.\n32\n conducted shear tests using a triaxial direct shear apparatus. The samples were cylindrical (2.5\n\u00d7\n2.5\u00a0cm), split vertically with half comprised of cement and the other half of steel. They performed surface profilometry of the cement surfaces after the shear tests and reported a mean-squared roughness of 10.8 and 4.\n\n8\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n depending on the curing time. The reported hydraulic apertures were in the same order of magnitude. The surface roughness values measured by Welch et al.\n32\n are close to the intrinsic residual aperture in this work. It should be noted that their measurements were conducted after shearing tests which could have impacted the surface roughness of the cement. The scale and the geometry of the cement surfaces in this work are also very different than the samples used by Welch et al.\n32\n, which could lead to different roughness values. Existence of a residual aperture at the microannuli has important consequences for well leakage. The residual aperture could maintain a minimum level of fluid leakage that cannot be mitigated by means of mechanical loading. However, it can be mitigated by chemical processes such as precipitation of minerals.(48) Further investigations on the relationship between the residual aperture of the microannuli and surface roughness is needed to identify optimum leakage mitigation measures.\n\n\n4.3\nHydraulic versus mechanical apertures\nIn this work, we used a finite element model to calculate the mechanical aperture of the microannulus at the casing\u2013cement interface. However, the aperture values calculated from the flow experiments represented the hydraulic apertures of the microannuli. Hydraulic aperture is usually smaller than the mechanical aperture due to roughness of the microannulus surface and flow path tortuosity.(38; 41) They can be assumed to be equal when the roughness between the two surfaces is much smaller than the aperture size.(49; 47) The roughness of the cement surface is likely of the same order of magnitude as the aperture sizes in our experiments.(32) Therefore, we expect a difference between the magnitude of the mechanical and hydraulic apertures.\nGeomechanical modelling is an effective way to assess the integrity of the annular cement in the wellbores under different geological and operational settings.(22) These models have been also used to predict the aperture of the microannulus considering the operational history of a well.(37; 18) However, the model predictions are mechanical apertures which need to be translated to hydraulic apertures to estimate well leakage. To bridge the gap between the model predictions and annular fluid leakage, we need to understand the relationship between the mechanical and hydraulic apertures of the microannulus.\nThe relationship between the hydraulic and mechanical apertures of fractures has been extensively studied.(39; 38; 40; 41) Barton et al.\n40\n proposed the following empirical relationship between the hydraulic and the mechanical aperture and the Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC): \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nJ\nR\n\n\nC\n\n\n2\n.\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere, \n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n is the hydraulic aperture, \n\n\ne\n\n\nm\n\n\n is the mean mechanical aperture and \n\nJ\nR\nC\n\n is the joint roughness coefficient as defined by Barton and Choubey\n50\n. More sophisticated correlations have been proposed that incorporate the standard deviation of the mechanical aperture measurements, and contact area between the two faces of the fractures.(39; 41; 51; 52) An important shortcoming of Eq.\u00a0(4) and other correlations in the literature is that they do not result in a residual hydraulic aperture when the mechanical aperture approaches zero. We propose the following relationship that honors the observation of residual aperture in the experiments: \n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n=\nexp\n\n(\na\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere, \n\n\ne\n\n\nr\n\n\n is the residual hydraulic aperture, \n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n and \n\n\ne\n\n\nm\n\n\n are the hydraulic and mean mechanical apertures, and \na\n is an empirical parameter. In Eq.\u00a0(5), mechanical and hydraulic apertures are normalized using the residual aperture. For elastic deformation of asperities, we can replace the expression for the residual aperture from Eq.\u00a0(3) in Eq.\u00a0(5) to obtain: \n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\ni\n\n\nexp\n\n(\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\nP\n)\n\n\n\n=\nexp\n\n(\na\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\ni\n\n\nexp\n\n(\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\nP\n)\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nBased on Eq.\u00a0(6), as the mechanical aperture approaches zero, hydraulic aperture approaches the residual value (which is dependent on flowing fluid pressure), as observed in our experimental results. Both the intrinsic residual aperture and the parameter \na\n are expected to be related to the roughness of the cement surface. Using an intrinsic residual aperture of \n\n10\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n, and a compressibility of 0.35 MPa\u22121 (obtained from Fig.\u00a08), Fig.\u00a09 presents a plot of the normalized hydraulic apertures from our casing pressure experiments and the normalized mechanical apertures from the numerical results.\n\nA curve fit of the data presented in Fig.\u00a09 returns a value of 0.135 for parameter \na\n with a R2 of 0.934. Using this value for \na\n, Fig.\u00a010 provides a plot of the hydraulic versus mechanical apertures calculated using Eq.\u00a0(6), assuming an intrinsic residual aperture of \n\n10\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. The hydraulic apertures measured in this work are also plotted against the mechanical apertures estimated using the numerical model. Fig.\u00a010 indicates that Eq.\u00a0(6) can describe the relationship between the mechanical and hydraulic apertures with reasonable accuracy. Average fluid pressures of 0.5 and 2.5 MPa are considered in Fig.\u00a011, as they represent the lower and upper bounds of fluid pressure in the experiments. According to Fig.\u00a010, due to the presence of a residual hydraulic aperture, \n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n is higher than \n\n\ne\n\n\nm\n\n\n at low mechanical apertures. However, as the mechanical aperture increases, it eventually exceeds the hydraulic aperture. Barton\u2019s (1985) equation (Eq.\u00a0(4)) is also plotted in Fig.\u00a010, assuming a JRC of 6 to best fit the experimental data. The results show that Eq.\u00a0(4) does not adequately describe the trend in the experimental results.\n\nIn order to use Eq.\u00a0(6), an estimate of the intrinsic residual aperture is required. This could be dependent on surface roughness of the cement at the microannulus interface. The results of our large-scale experiments indicate an intrinsic residual aperture of \n\n10\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n and residual aperture values ranging between 15 and \n\n30\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n, depending on the fluid pressure. Based on this range of residual apertures, our results show that setting the fitting constant \u201c\na\n\u201d equal to 0.135, sufficiently describes the data. It must be noted that if the residual aperture magnitude changes significantly, the value of \na\n should also be scaled accordingly. In addition, at high mechanical apertures (over \n\n1000\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n in the present case), Eq.\u00a0(6) returns \n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n values higher than \n\n\ne\n\n\nm\n\n\n, which would be incorrect. At high mechanical apertures, hydraulic and mechanical apertures are equal. Therefore, Eq.\u00a0(6) should only be used for the lower range of mechanical apertures, ideally below \n\n500\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. This range should be sufficient for well integrity problems including a microannulus. The same restriction applies to classic relationships between \n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n and \n\n\ne\n\n\nm\n\n\n, such as in Eq.\u00a0(4).\nEq.\u00a0(6) provides a new relationship between the mechanical apertures calculated using well integrity models and the hydraulic apertures that determine fluid leakage through microannuli. Using the mechanical aperture calculations to determine flow can greatly overestimate the fluid leakage along a wellbore if a microannulus is open. Subsequently, if the microannulus is formed but is closed due to high casing pressures or temperatures, fluid leakage could be underestimated by relying solely on the results of the mechanical models. Therefore, incorporating the results of this work in well leakage models will yield better forecasts of critical apertures for loss of zonal isolation and assessment of potential fluid leakage rates.\n\n\n4.4\nImplications for well leakage calculation\nIn order to assess the applicability of the measured hydraulic aperture values in this work to actual well leakage scenarios, we performed a literature review for methane emission measurements from oil and gas wells. There are several recent studies that have measured methane emissions at oil and gas wellheads (Table\u00a04), using a static chamber methodology.(53) The measurements were calibrated by recording the baseline methane emissions in the vicinity of the wells. Table\u00a04 summarizes the results of 10 leakage datasets. 8 of the datasets were gathered from the United States, 1 from the UK, and the remaining dataset was from abandoned oil and gas wells in the Netherlands. Each dataset contained several wells, ranging from 19 to 147. Each publication has reported different statistical parameters and different units of leakage. To make the comparison possible, we have only summarized the average and the maximum leakage rates encountered in their results, in kg\/yr. The average leakage rates in these datasets are relatively small, ranging between 0 and 364\u00a0kg\/yr for abandoned wells and 1218\u00a0kg\/yr for active wells. To put these numbers into perspective, a dairy cow on average releases 100\u00a0kg of methane per year.(54) However, in most cases the maximum leak rate was at least an order of magnitude higher than the average. The max leakage rates in all datasets ranged between 2 and 3881\u00a0kg\/yr for abandoned wells, and 28286\u00a0kg\/yr for actively producing wells. It should be noted that only one dataset included measurements for active wells. More leakage measurements on active wells are needed to improve the confidence for this comparison.\n\nWe wish to investigate whether the magnitude of the leak rates observed in the field-scale measurements are in line with the hydraulic apertures measured in this work, should microannuli develop along the entire well sections from leak source to surface. To this end, we designed a thought experiment of a hypothetical abandoned well with a microannulus connecting a gas pocket to surface. The gas bearing formation was assumed to be 1500 metres deep at hydrostatic pore pressure. We calculated the hypothetical steady-state methane leakage to surface considering various aperture sizes using Eq.\u00a0(7). Eq.\u00a0(7) presents a more generalized form of Eq.\u00a0(1), suitable for calculating gas leakage through a microannulus.(60) \n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n(\nP\n,\nT\n)\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n(\nP\n,\nT\n)\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\u03c0\nR\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n(\nP\n\u2212\n\u03c1\ng\nz\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n is the mass flow rate of gas, \n\u03c1\n and \n\u03bc\n are gas density and viscosity, \nR\n is the casing outer radius, \n\n\ne\n\n\nh\n\n\n is the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus, \nP\n is the gas pressure, and \nz\n represents depth. Eq.\u00a0(7) considers the impact of gravity, which is significant in case of gas leakage to surface. Other assumptions in Eq.\u00a0(7) include steady-state flow, single phase fluid, and laminar flow regime. Gas density and viscosity are strong functions of pressure and temperature. This complexity hinders a straightforward solution to Eq.\u00a0(7). We calculated the gas rate in Eq.\u00a0(7) numerically, using a procedure similar to Hongjun et al.\n61\n. Peng and Robinson\n62\n equation of state was used for calculating methane compressibility (used for density calculations) and the measurements by Lee et al.\n63\n were used to estimate methane viscosity.\n\n\nFig.\u00a011 provides a summary of the maximum and average leakage rates measured in all the datasets covered in this work. Additionally, the dashed horizontal lines in Fig.\u00a011 illustrate the calculated leakage rates at specific hydraulic aperture sizes, using Eq.\u00a0(7). The results show that the average leak rates reported in the datasets correspond to average hydraulic aperture sizes in the range of 1 to \n\n30\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. The maximum measured leak rates correspond to average aperture sizes between 2 and \n\n100\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n. This is an overly simplistic well leakage scenario, as in reality leakage pathways are likely formed from a combination of microannuli, shear and radial cracks, cement channels, and uncemented segments. However, this analysis provides a first screening of the magnitude of the leakage rates that could be caused by the range of microannuli apertures measured in this work, and how they compare to actual field measurements at the wellhead. It is of interest to assess whether typical microannuli apertures from models and experiments and the associated leakage rates are in line with the leakage measurements in the field cases.\n\nFig.\u00a012 demonstrates a contour plot of predicted surface leakage rates of methane considering a range of hydraulic aperture sizes and depths of the gas source, assuming hydrostatic pressures. Eq.\u00a0(7) was used to generate this plot assuming that the microannulus connects the gas formation to the surface. This plot can be used to obtain a quick estimate of the expected leakage rate in a well, by estimating the mechanical aperture of the microannulus using geomechanical models and converting it to the hydraulic aperture using Eq.\u00a0(6). Conversely, we can identify the maximum allowable hydraulic aperture size in a well to keep the leakage below a threshold. For instance, Fig.\u00a012 indicates that if hydraulic aperture can be maintained below \n\n20\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n leakage rates are below \n\u223c\n100\u00a0kg\/yr (equivalent to methane emissions of a dairy cow) regardless of the depth of the gas source. These aperture estimates are likely conservative as the presence of water in the microannuli further hampers gas migration. This range is close to the residual aperture values measured in this work. In other words, while the microannulus does not seem to fully close, keeping its hydraulic aperture at the residual value can limit the leakage rate to amounts that are negligible compared to natural baselines. Assessment of these critical thresholds can assist operators and regulators in designing well abandonment conditions based on geomechanical models of the near wellbore region. One role of well integrity analyses is to identify and mitigate the likelihood of significant leaks from wells. The combined large-scale laboratory measurements and geomechanical modelling approach in this study provides a methodology to forecast the hydraulic apertures that can be present in the subsurface. This methodology could therefore be used to assess the leakage risks for new and abandoned wells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, we combined experimental analysis and numerical modelling to assess microannuli development and leakage rates at the casing\u2013cement interface. We conducted a large-scale experimental campaign to understand the change in the hydraulic aperture of the microannuli at the casing\u2013cement interface, under different loading conditions. The results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of aperture development and sealing capacity of the cement sheath. The hydraulic aperture of the casing\u2013cement microannuli in a large-scale setup was measured to be in the range of tens of microns. The hydraulic aperture decreased as the casing was pressurized to 40 MPa, but it remained open. A residual hydraulic aperture between 15 and \n\n30\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n was observed in our results. Our results show that axial displacement of the casing does not significantly change the hydraulic aperture of the microannulus. A finite element numerical model was used to simulate the mechanical aperture of the microannuli under the same conditions as the experiments. We investigated the relationship between the mechanical and hydraulic apertures of the microannuli. A new equation is proposed to predict the hydraulic aperture of microannuli using the mechanical aperture determined by numerical simulations. The proposed equation captures the residual hydraulic aperture observed in our experimental results.\nA review of field-scale measurements of methane leakage from abandoned wells support the order of magnitude of the hydraulic apertures determined in the present experiments and models. The large-scale laboratory measurements and modelling results in this work provide a methodology to use geomechanical models to forecast the hydraulic apertures that can be present in the subsurface. The methodology could be used by operators and regulators to determine the leakage risk of wells, and to devise effective leakage mitigation and well abandonment strategies.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAl Moghadam: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 original draft, Visualization, Validation.

However, while the fractures on one side have a huge potential of enhancing oil production, a downside is the inherent difficulty of controlling the fracture process, and the associated risks related to uncontrollable fractures. This has led to the demand of a more thorough understanding of the fracture process and how it can be controlled. Typically, reservoir models are focusing on the fluid flow modelling without consideration of the fluid\u2013rock interaction. Assumptions can indeed be made about fracture generation without support from solid mechanics theory, but as the subsurface fracture processes cannot be observed directly, it is difficult to constrain assumptions without explicitly modelling the multiphysics of the fracture process. Some theoretical models for the fracture generation includes the Perkins\u2013Kern\u2013Nordgren (PKN) model in\u00a0\n1\n and\u00a0Nordgren,\n2\n and for linear and radial propagating fracture geometries (KGN) in De Klerk.\n3\n The 3D Penny-shaped fracture model (P3D) were developed in\u00a0\n4\n and 3D planar models (PL3D) were developed in the period 1980\u20132000 in\u00a0Settari and Cleary,\n5\n Clifton and Abou-Sayed,\n6\n\n\n7\n and more. Within the last decades several studies using the Finite Element Method have emerged.\u00a0\n8\n studied fracture growth based on fluid\u2013rock interaction, without the explicit use of fracture mechanics and without considering the large variations in pressure in a field under production. The crack band model was used in\u00a0\n9\n to study long term 3D branching effects in a rock with anisotropic behaviour. More advanced fracture models, based on the Enhanced Local Pressure model, were investigated comparing to X-FEM for short term fracture growth in\u00a0\n10\n and studying single and mixed mode fracture nucleation and propagation in saturated porous materials in Remij et\u00a0al. \n11\n. Of more recent contributions are: the studies of hydraulic fractures in rock types with elastic\u2013plastic deformations in\u00a0Liu et\u00a0al.,\n12\n, a 1D leak-off study of a Biot\u2013Stokes model using a staggered approach to model interface condition between fracture and bulk material in\u00a0\n13\n and a proppant transport study using a monolithic coupled model and X-FEM in Rivas and Gracie.\n14\n These works, as well as most others, rest on theoretical material parameters to focus on specific aspects of the fracturing process.\nThe purpose of the present work is to numerically study the fracturing processes occurring during water injection and during production, i.e.\u00a0in a case where large lateral variations in pressure affects the state of stress in the subsurface. The parameters used here mimics data from the Chalk fields in the North Sea region, e.g.\u00a0the Halfdan oil-field, the Dan Field etc. The well pattern in the Halfdan is used as inspiration, since its simple geometrical layout with parallel producers and injectors is perfect for numerical studies based realistically on plane strain conditions.\nThis study uses the Finite Element Method for the combined fluid flow and stress analysis along with Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) to study the growth of hydraulic fractures in the reservoir. The fluid-filled chalk is modelled as a coupled Biot material model, able to capture rock\u2013fluid interaction during production.\nThe crack tip load is quantified by the stress intensity factor, which is evaluated numerically using a modified J-integral, accounting for the pore pressure in the bulk material\n15\n as well as the functionally graded material properties.\n16\n A straight forward nodal release method is employed to track the geometry of the fracture.\nThe layout of the manuscript is as follows: In Section\u00a02, all governing equations are presented starting with a short introduction to the Biot model followed by a presentation of the constitutive equations used for the fluid and rock mechanics. In Section\u00a03, the fracture criterion in terms of the modified J-integral is defined. In Section\u00a04, the implementation of the governing equations in a numerical accurate finite element setting is presented. In Section\u00a05, the problem is defined and the model assumptions are stated. the model parameters are further discussed including discretization in time and space. In Section\u00a06 the model results are presented and discussed, and the final conclusions of the study are found in Section\u00a07.\n\n\n2\nMaterial model\nIn Biot\u2019s model for poroelasticity, a fluid-filled porous material is assumed to consist of a freely moving fluid in the pores and the solid skeleton with full connection between the solid and the fluid.\n17\n A volume, \nV\n, of porous material is then a sum of the fluid volume, \n\n\nV\n\n\nf\n\n\n, and the volume of the solid skeleton, \n\n\nV\n\n\ns\n\n\n. The ratio between the fluid\u2013volume (pore-space volume) and the total volume is defined as the porosity of the material \n\n\u03d5\n=\n\n\nV\n\n\nf\n\n\n\/\nV\n\n. Using index notation, \n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n defines the Cartesian coordinates at any point. The displacement tensor, \n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n, tracks the movement of the solid skeleton at a point with respect to its initial configuration and the specific discharge tensor, \n\n\nq\n\n\ni\n\n\n, defines the rate of fluid flow field.\nWith \n\u03bd\n denoting Poisson\u2019s ratio, \nK\n the bulk modulus, \nE\n Young\u2019s modulus and \nG\n the shear modulus, the drained, \n\n\n\u2217\n\n\nd\n\n\n, and undrained, \n\n\n\u2217\n\n\nu\n\n\n, constitutive constants are related as: \n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\n\n\n3\n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n\u2212\n2\nG\n\n\n2\n\n(\n3\n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n+\nG\n)\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n\n\n=\n\n\n3\n\n\nK\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u2212\n2\nG\n\n\n2\n\n(\n3\n\n\nK\n\n\nu\n\n\n+\nG\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\n2\nG\n\n(\n1\n+\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nd\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nu\n\n\n=\n2\nG\n\n(\n1\n+\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n Note that \n\n\n\nG\n\n\nu\n\n\n=\n\n\nG\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\nG\n\n since the shear modulus of fluid is zero.\nIn this study the reservoir chalk is assumed to be microscopically homogeneous and isotropic and to have ideal porous behaviour characterized by fully connected pore spaces. This simplifies the poroelastic expressions for the bulk continuum constants; Biot\u2019s coefficient \n\u03b1\n, the undrained bulk modulus \n\n\nK\n\n\nu\n\n\n and the storage coefficient, \nS\n, (inverse Biot\u2019s modulus) are thus given by \n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u03b1\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nu\n\n\n=\n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n)\n\n\n(\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n\u03d5\n)\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nf\n\n\n+\n\u03d5\n\n\nK\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nS\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\nM\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\nK\n\n\ns\n\n\n and \n\n\nK\n\n\nf\n\n\n are the bulk moduli of the solid and fluid respectively.\n\n2.1\nGoverning equations\nAccording to Biot\u2019s theory, the governing equations for a poroelastic system can be defined individually for the fluid and the solid phase.

Since, the fractures are known to occur in the vertical direction, symmetry dictates that only Mode I failure needs to be considered, and hence, the Mode I critical stress intensity factor for the chalk, \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nc\n\n\n, will determine fracture propagation.\nThe stress intensity factor at the crack tips, \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n, at a given load state will be determined by numerical calculations of the J-integral. For LEFM the \nJ\n-integral is equal to the critical energy release rate, \n\n\nG\n\n\nI\n\n\n, which is related to the stress intensity factor as: \n\n(22)\n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\nI\n\n\n=\n\n\nG\n\n\nI\n\n\n=\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen this value exceeds the critical stress intensity factor the fracture will propagate. Since no data is available for the Central Graben fields the critical value is based on experimental data from the Moen chalk field.\n19\n This critical stress intensity factor has been found to be \n\n(23)\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nIc\n\n\n\u2248\n200\n\nkPa\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental data on other rock types have shown a dependency between porosity and fracture toughness (see for instance\u00a0\n20\n and\u00a0\n21\n), meaning in principle the fracture toughness is dependent on depth. It will, however, be shown that the precise value is not important for the conclusions made in this study.\nThe \nJ\n-integral is defined as a closed contour integral as originally defined by\u00a0Rice.\n22\n. Here, the relevant contour integral is transformed into a surface integral within the contour following.\n23\n The formulation is adapted to this model by including terms for Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) from\u00a0\n16\n and poroelastic terms from\u00a0Song and Rahman.\n15\n. Coordinate transformations and symmetry conditions are used to apply the closed contour formulation to the upper (\n\u2191\n) and lower (\n\u2193\n) crack tips.

formulation\n\nThe reservoir modelled is a chalk reservoir with an oil layer which is \nH\n=100 metres thick and buried at a depth of 2150 m below sea-level. A cross sectional overview of the well pattern is shown in Fig.\u00a02. The porous network of the chalk is saturated with oil and water. The reservoir is situated above a low-permeability layer (referred to as the underburden) and below a hard shale layer (the overburden). The oil is recovered using a series of long parallel horizontal wells, arranged in a line drive of alternate injectors and producers. The injectors inject sea water into the reservoir, and oil is displaced laterally towards the adjacent producers connected to the surface. The reservoir properties are typical for tight chalk reservoirs in the North Sea. The chalk has the advantages of a relatively high porosity (up to 40%), meaning a high potential for storing oil, but it has a low permeability 0.1\u20134 mD, and the oil-displacement process is therefore inherently slow. Furthermore, a vast amount of the oil will not be recovered during production due to trapping of oil in the micro pores that will contain an oil saturation residual after flooding. Hydraulic fractures are used in the oil field to increase the vertical sweep and to provide leakoff area and increase injectivity to the injectors. This is done by injecting at fracturing conditions whereby vertical fractures are created. Vertical cracks change the flow characteristics in the reservoir from radial near the injector toward horizontal, thus leading to a more efficient oil displacement. The existence of the vertical hydraulic fractures has been verified in e.g.\u00a0the Halfdan field through seismic data, see in Dons et\u00a0al.,\n25\n and through pressure transient analysis .\n26\n\n\n\n5.1\nModelling assumptions\nDue to the few natural fractures in the chalk and the fact that the chalk exhibits low anisotropic behaviour, the chalk can be modelled as a homogeneous isotropic material. Additionally, the many long horizontal wells are parallel and linear and the chalk stratification justifies a layer-cake model, implying that material parameters will only change with depth. Thus, a 2D plane strain model provides a good geometrical approximation. Furthermore, the well pattern (see Fig.\u00a02) implies that symmetry boundary conditions may be used to model the major part of the reservoir such that only half of a single injector and half of a single producer need to be included in the model.\nSince this study focuses on effects on the reservoir scale evolving over months and years, pressure transients in the fracture will be neglected, i.e.\u00a0the flow in the hydraulic fracture is not modelled. Hence, neither pressure loss in the fractures nor between the fracture and the bulk material are considered. The macroscopic fracture paths are known by symmetry conditions to be vertical, which simplifies the fracture analysis. Finally, it is assumed that the fracture cannot penetrate the overburden and the underburden, but rather that it stops if these boundaries are reached. Hence, only the vertically growth inside the reservoir is under consideration in this study. Further details on the modelling assumptions are discussed along with the results presented in Section\u00a06.\n\n\n5.2\nModel parameters\nAll input parameters are chosen to describe realistic reservoir conditions. The values are representative for chalk reservoirs in the North Sea region. All independent material parameters are listed in Table\u00a01. The rest of the poroelastic parameters, the drained bulk modulus, the drained Young\u2019s modulus, the shear modulus, the undrained bulk modulus, the undrained Poisson\u2019s ratio, the bulk density and the storage coefficient, are calculated from these independent values using Eqs.\u00a0(1)\u2013(5). The fluid dependent parameters (density, bulk modulus, viscosity and oil saturation) need to be calculated for the specific fluid state in each integration point. This will be addressed later in this section.\nThe reservoir dimensions employed according to Fig.\u00a02 are listed in Table\u00a02. The wells are assumed drilled centrally between the overburden and underburden at a distance of half the reservoir height \n\nH\n\/\n2\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\nDiscretization of time and domain\nThe FEM discretization of the domain is shown in Fig.\u00a03 with a total of 17.007 elements. A refined discretization is used around the wells and along the extended fracture planes with an element dimension of about 0.2 metres along. This discretization and the initial fracture length is chosen based on a convergence study of the stress intensity factor for an edge crack.\n1\n\n\n1\nshort term for typical well production profile.\n\n\nFor the LEFM-based fracture criterion the arbitrary smooth function \nq\n (used in the numerical calculation of the \nJ\n-integral) is chosen as a right circular cone with value 1 at the crack tip and value zero along the circular area within which the \nJ\n-integral is evaluated. The radius of the circular area is chosen to be 2.00 m (see Fig.\u00a07(a)). Hence, at least 18 elements will be included within the diameter of the cone (at least 10 elements along the fracture surface and 10 elements behind the crack tip). Based on the study of an edge crack a maximum error of 2% is expected on the calculated stress intensity factors.\n\nThe time increments are set to \n\n\u0394\nt\n=\n4\n\n h, but are lowered to \n\n\u0394\nt\n=\n60\n\ns for 100 increments after each boundary update (production start and each fracture update).\n\n\n5.4\nDepth dependent material data\nThe porosity in the reservoir and the parameters related to the porosity will depend on depth (marked with D.D. in Table\u00a01). The layer-cake model implies that the reservoir represented in Fig.\u00a02 will have the same depth profiles for all material parameters.\nIn this study the depth variations are chosen as continuous curves fitted to a typical well production profile for the Halfdan field analysed in Albrechtsen et\u00a0al. \n27\n Data points and the fitted curves for the porosity are plotted in Fig.\u00a04, and for initial oil saturation in Fig.\u00a05. The reservoir depth is relative to the injector and producer height (consistently with Fig.\u00a03).\nThe model reservoir contains chalk from two time periods. The chalk of the upper part of the reservoir is from the Danian age and the lower part of the reservoir is from the Maastrichtian age. These two ages are separated by the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. The depth dependent material parameters show large variations over this boundary. Besides this, greater depth in general means more compact chalk and therefore a lower porosity. The chalk is water-wet, and there is a capillary entry pressure to overcome in order to fill oil into the pores. As a result, just above the Danian\u2013Maastricht boundary where the porosity drops to around 16%, the oil saturation drops to zero. The data points of porosity and oil saturation is seen to drop just above the upper boundary (\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n50\n\n m). This drop is caused by the different characteristics of overburden shale layer which is not included in the model.\n\n\nSeveral other material parameters such as drained Young\u2019s modulus, permeability and bulk density, depends on the porosity. The drained Young\u2019s modulus is modelled with the following exponential equation. \n\n(44)\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\n1\n.\n24\n\u22c5\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n(\n\u2212\n9\n.\n25\n\u03d5\n)\n\n\n\n\u00a0Pa\n\n\n\nThe permeability is fitted with laboratory measured data of permeability as a function of porosity for chalk samples from the reservoir. The relations are from\u00a0\n28\n and\u00a0Fabricius.\n29\n\n\nThe drained Young\u2019s modulus and the permeability reservoir depth profiles can be seen in Fig.\u00a06. Note the correlation for the permeability and the inverse correlation for the drained Young\u2019s modulus.\n\nSome of the results in Section\u00a06 will be compared to a similar case where the depth dependent parameters are kept constant. This case will be referred to as Constant Depth Parameters (CDP). For CDP the parameters are defined in Table\u00a03.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5\nBoundary conditions\nThe initial pore pressure along the centre-line of the reservoir, \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n\n, is set to \n\n\n\np\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n]\n\n=\n28\n.\n9\n\nMPa\n\n, with a hydro-static pressure gradient to account for gravity such that \n\n\n\np\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n]\n\n\u2212\n\n\np\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n[\n0\n]\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nf\nw\n1\n\n\ng\n\n. To simulate a realistic pre-production stress state, a vertical displacement is added at the top layer \n\n\n\nu\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\nH\n\/\n2\n]\n\n=\n\u2212\n0\n.\n11\n\n m, and a vertical compression is added to the right boundary \n\n\n\nu\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nx\n\n\n1\n\n\n=\nL\n]\n\n=\n\u2212\n0\n.\n18\n\n m leading to a realistic initial stress state in the chalk in the central Graben field at 2\u00a0km burial (An initial vertical stress of \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n22\n\n\n=\n45\n.\n6\n\nMPa\n\n at the overburden an initial horizontal stress of \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u2248\n38\n\nMPa\n\n around the well).\nThe producer pressure is applied as a pore pressure along the circumference of the producer well of magnitude \n\n\n\np\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n=\n10\n.\n0\n\nMPa\n\n. The injector pressure is given in terms of the pore pressure \n\np\n=\n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n\nMPa\n\n as well as an equivalent traction force along the crack surface, thus assuming that there is no pressure loss in the fracture nor between the fracture and the pores in the bulk material. The injector pressure for the case study is set below the critical pressure for cracking, \n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n,\nc\nr\ni\nt\n\n\n, determined in the beginning of Section\u00a06.1.\nAn initial fracture height of 2 m is set for the upper and lower fracture. Above and below the fracture symmetric boundary conditions are applied to the left boundary of the domain. To avoid negative horizontal displacements of the fracture walls (implying that fracture walls are in contact), symmetry conditions are applied at the fracture walls when needed. The relevant nodes with symmetry conditions are determined in an iterative manner, by checking for negative horizontal displacements (meaning symmetry conditions are needed) as well as negative horizontal reaction forces (meaning symmetry conditions needs to be removed) along the fracture wall.\n\n\n5.6\nFront-line tracing and multiple fluid-phases\nAs seen in Table\u00a01, the fluid parameters are defined for three different phases; the oil, the warm formation water and the colder injected water. To account for these phases, two fluid states are considered. Before process start the fluid parameters are determined from the existing water and the initial oil saturation (SOI) as: \n\n\n\n\n(\n\u2217\n)\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\nS\nO\nI\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n(\n\u2217\n)\n\n\n\nf\no\n\n\n+\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nS\nO\nI\n)\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n(\n\u2217\n)\n\n\n\nf\nw\n1\n\n\n\n. After being swept by water, the oil percentage will decrease, and the water will be cooled by and partly replaced by the injected water. To account for these effects, without implementing a full multi-phase model, it is assumed that after a node in the FEM-model is swept by the injected water, the constitutive parameters for the fluids are changed to \n\n\n\n\n(\n\u2217\n)\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\nS\nO\nR\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n(\n\u2217\n)\n\n\n\nf\no\n\n\n+\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nS\nO\nR\n)\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n(\n\u2217\n)\n\n\n\nf\nw\n2\n\n\n\n. The remaining oil will be trapped in the channels, and since the chalk is water-wet the droplets of oil will block the flow of the injector water reducing the permeability to 20% of the original value.\nThe frontline is traced throughout the calculations, with a built-in particle trace algorithm, tracing a particle for every 0.2 metres of crack face. The algorithm uses a Ray-casting algorithm\n30\n and an inverse isoparametric algorithm to capture the particle velocity at a given time-step. The particle movement is updated using the forward Euler method, which was found sufficiently precise for the time-steps used in this paper. The injected water flows away from the injector and towards the producer. Hence, the traced particles form a front-line which may be approximated by connecting the particles with linear line segments. Everything located within the water front-line (on the injector side) is assumed to be fully swept by the injected water.\n\n\n5.7\nFracture propagation speed\nThe fracture propagation speed is limited by two additional conditions in addition to the linear elastic fracture criterion \n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n=\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nc\n\n\n\n (see Section\u00a03):\n\n\n\n1.\nFracture propagation cannot be faster than 0.4m\/day. This condition ensures the inflow have time to stabilize after a fracture update before the subsequent fracture conditions are evaluated\n\n\n2.\nThe fluid in-flow at fracture propagation cannot exceed the maximum inflow value \n\n\n\nq\n\n\ni\nn\n,\nm\na\nx\n\n\n=\n12\n\n barrels per day per metre of horizontal well (bbl\/day\/m) during fracture propagation\n\n\n\nThe second condition is set to constrain the injection rate and builds on the assumption that rate transients during fracture growth has to be physically plausible, in the sense that if the predicted leak-off is too high, the pumps do not have the capacity to extend the fracture further, since they cannot maintain the necessary pressure. In reality, if the pumps cannot deliver the prescribed boundary pressure, the pressure in the fracture would drop accordingly, which the present geomechanical model can account for. Investigations of the flow in the fracture and the fluid interaction (leak off) between fracture and bulk material have been carried out by\u00a0\n31\n and\u00a0Bergkamp et\u00a0al.,\n13\n where a maximum inflow condition is used to model fracture delays due to pump limitations.\n\n\n\n6\nResults\n\n6.1\nDetermination of critical injector pressure\nBefore addressing long term solutions, a critical injector pressure, \n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n,\nc\nr\ni\nt\n\n\n, is determined. The critical injector pressure is defined as the lowest injector pressure at which a fracture will start to propagate at initial conditions.\nThe horizontal pre-stress state, imposed by the initial displacement of the rock, and the pore pressure can be seen in Fig.\u00a07(a), as well as the domain used for calculation of the J-integral for the upper fracture. In Fig.\u00a07(b), the stress intensity factor for different injector pressures, \n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n, at the first time step is plotted.\n\nA linear tendency between the stress intensity factor and the injected pressure were found for pressures of \n\n48\n\nMPa\n\n and above. The stress intensity factor for the upper fracture is greater than for the lower fracture, due to the functionally graded material (FGM) properties and gravity-contributions to the J-integral, as well as the hydro-static difference in pore pressure in the bulk material surrounding the two fractures. For increasing injector pressure, the difference between upper and lower fracture stress intensity factor reduces. The critical injector pressure was found to be \n\n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n,\nc\nr\ni\nt\n\n\n=\n41\n.\n95\n\nMPa\n\n for the upper fracture and \n\n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n,\nc\nr\ni\nt\n\n\n=\n42\n.\n73\n\nMPa\n\n for the lower fracture.\nFor the upper fracture the curve flattens around the critical injector pressure. For injector pressures below the critical pressure for the upper fracture the pressure is too low to keep the fracture walls open, such that there will be contact between the fracture walls across the symmetry line. This indicates that the fracture would not be open in the first place and hence the calculation of the J-integral will be invalid. As soon as the injector pressure is high enough to prevent any contact forces along the fracture wall, the fracture criterion is fulfilled for the upper fracture with a stress intensity factor of 1.7 MPa m\n\n\n\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n, which is in the range of the fracture toughness of other reservoir rock types with high fracture toughness (sandstone, shale and mud-stone for instance).\nFor the lower fracture, when the critical pressure is reached, changes as small as 2\u00a0kPa in the injector pressure leads to significant changes in the stress intensity factor even up to the critical value. When the injector pressure is more than 0.5 MPa above the critical pressure, the lower fracture can break through hard rock types as well. Note that unphysical negative J-integral values were obtained for lower \n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n values for the lower fracture.\nIn Fig.\u00a07(b) the same graphs for the CDP case are plotted as well, with no depth dependent contributions besides gravity. It is seen that gravity alone leads to a similar curve tendency for the upper and lower fracture, but the difference is not as large as for the depth dependent case. The critical pressure for the Constant Depth Parameters (CDP) case is more than 2.5 MPa higher than the depth dependent case study, emphasizing the importance of correctly modelling the realistic material properties for the present studies.\nWith knowledge of the critical pressure the aim is to operate below the initial critical pressure during production. Consequently, fracturing becomes the result of changes in stress caused by the flow in the reservoir. Hence, the parallel producers which are placed symmetrically with respect to the injector are providing the conditions that open the fracture along the vertical symmetry plane. Thus, fracturing is the result of stress changes induced in the entire reservoir volume, that develop over a long time. This way fracturing in the line drive does not lead to lateral, since the injector is placed along the symmetry plane which is also the plane with maximum tensile stresses leading to mode I fracturing. For the case studied in this paper an injector pressure of \n\n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n38\n\nMPa\n\n and a producer pressure of \n\n\n\np\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n=\n10\n\nMPa\n\n were applied.\n\n\n6.2\nLong term case study, with \n\n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n38\n\nMPa\n\n and \n\n\n\np\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n=\n10\n\n MPa\n\nFor this case study more than 20\u00a0years of production is simulated. The tracked front lines for every two years of production are shown in Fig.\u00a08. The left-most frontline is for 1 year of production and the line furthest to the right is after 17\u00a0years of production. In the background the pressure field is plotted at time \nt\n=20\u00a0years. At this time the pressure field is nearly stationary. The front lines of the case study in Fig.\u00a08 shows that the flow is faster in the first years of production compared to the last years of production. This is caused by the larger pressure gradients present in the reservoir in the beginning leading to a fast moving front-line. As the pressure field evolves toward the stationary solution seen in the background of Fig.\u00a08, the pressure gradients become smaller leading to a slower moving front line according to Darcy\u2019s law. Water-break-through time is the time it takes for the first injected water to reach the producer, which for this case study occurs just before 17\u00a0years of production. For comparison, the front line of the CDP case for the first five years of production were included in Fig.\u00a08. The injector and producer pressure were set to ensure fracture growth. With \n\n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n44\n\nMPa\n\n and \n\n\n\np\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n=\n2\n\nMPa\n\n a fracture height of \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n1\n\n\n=\n6\n.\n1\n\n m (upwards) and \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n2\n\n m (downwards) were reached after 22.2 days of production. The effect of a depth dependent material model on the sweep is seen by studying the differences in the frontline profiles between the CDP case and the depth dependent case study. The CDP case is alone affected by buoyancy differences alone leaving a complete symmetrical front-line and fracture growth. The flow in the depth dependent case study is affected by both gravity and the depth dependencies of the material parameters. This modelling results in terms of the frontline seen in Fig.\u00a08 are highly affected by the large changes in material properties at the Danian\u2013Maastrichtian boundary (see Fig.\u00a06). The increase in permeability near the over-burden (see Fig.\u00a06) implies that the traced water particles will flow along the top boundary throughout the production.\nThe fracture propagates within the first 6.01\u00a0years of production. At this point in time the upper fracture reaches the overburden \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n1\n\n\n=\n50\n\n m and less than three days after the lower fracture stops propagating at a fracture depth of \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n31\n.\n37\n\n m.\nThe most significant changes in both the pressure and displacements in the system occur during fracture propagation. A close-up of the pore pressure, horizontal displacements and horizontal normal stress is plotted for the zone around the left boundary (the injector plane) during fracture growth in Fig.\u00a09. The pressure field develops slowly due to the low fluid diffusivity in the tight and compressible system. This means that a change in the pressure boundary condition will have long term influences in the reservoir. Comparing the pressure after 6\u00a0years of production to the pressure in Fig.\u00a08 after 20\u00a0years of production, it can be seen that the pressure after 6\u00a0years is close to the stationary solution. The displacements do not exhibit time-delays at the relevant time-scales, but they are coupled to the pore pressure and will for that reason continue to develop after fracture propagation ends, until the stationary solution is reached. Here, the long term effects of the difference in injector and producer pressure on displacements are visible. For the left figures there are no positive horizontal displacements except for a region near the fracture which is so small that it is not visible in the plot. The maximum displacement is just above 0.1\u00a0mm. After the 3.7\u00a0years of production, when the upper fracture is halfway from the overburden, the horizontal displacement reaches positive levels of approximately 3\u00a0mm. After six years of production, when the upper fracture reaches the overburden, the maximum horizontal displacement is 8\u00a0mm. It is seen that the displacement profile at this time is affected by both the upper boundary and the Danian\u2013Maastrichtian boundary, where the stiffness in the chalk is increased due to the drop in porosity. The total stress depends on both of the above, since it relates to the displacement directly through the effective stress and via Biot\u2019s coefficient to the pressure. Added to this is the initial stress in the system that was displayed in Fig.\u00a07(a). It is seen that the surface traction acting at the fracture wall affects the effective stress in a larger area around the fracture.\n\nThe fracture propagation during production can be seen for the case study in Fig.\u00a010(a) along with the inflow and outflow for later reference. The fracture propagation consists of different parts of unstable fracture growth (where the fracture propagation slope is steepest), but most of the time the fracture process is slow, with large time-spans during production where the fracture criterion is not fulfilled.\n\n\n6.3\nParametric study of injector and producer pressure\nThe influence of two surface controllable parameters, namely the injector pressure, \n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n, and the producer pressure, \n\n\np\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n, is now investigated. A parametric study is conducted, where the producer pressure and the injector pressure are systematically changed, while all other parameters are kept constant, i.e.\u00a0attained the values of the long-term case study (later referred to as the base case study).\nThe time for fracture initiation at different injector and producer pressures can be seen in Table\u00a04. By increasing the injector pressure the fracture initiates faster and a decrease in pressure leads to delayed fracture initiation. For injector pressures above the critical pressure the fracture will initiate at the very first time step, as this is the definition of the critical pressure. For an injector pressure of \n\n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n32\n\nMPa\n\n the fracture never initiates as the initial fracture walls stays in contact during production.\nThe producer pressure has a large influence on fracture initiation as well. By decreasing the producer pressure, the fracture is forced open earlier and by increasing the producer pressure fracture initiation is delayed. For \n\n\n\np\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n>\n20\n\nMPa\n\n the fracture never occurs. Comparing to the injector pressure this means, that the difference between injector and producer pressure must be at least 18 MPa for one of the fractures to initiate for the present case study.\nIn Fig.\u00a010 the inflow, outflow and fracture propagation are plotted for the first six years of production for different injector and producer pressures. Note that the calculation of the outflow is based on very few elements, and numerical errors will therefore have a visible effect on the results presented. Compared to the base case in Fig.\u00a010(a) by increasing the injector pressure by just 2 MPa (Fig.\u00a010(b)), the fractures were fully propagated twice as fast as for the case study with \n\n\n\np\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n38\n\nMPa\n\n. By lowering the pressure with 2 MPa (Fig.\u00a010(d)) the fracture growth rates were less than half for the upper fracture, with hardly any fracture propagation for the lower fracture. Changing the producer pressure leads to a similar changes (comparing Fig.\u00a010(b) to (c) and (d) to (e)), but with a slightly smaller influence on fracture propagation. Lowering the producer pressure with 4 MPa compared to the base case (Fig.\u00a010(d)) leads to a much higher flow rate, where the fracture propagation is unstable according to the fracture criterion, but constrained by the maximum inflow condition of \n\n\n\nq\n\n\ni\nn\n,\nm\na\nx\n\n\n=\n12\n\n bbl\/day\/m. Both fractures propagate almost equally and the lower fracture grows close to the underburden with \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n48\n.\n5\n\n m as the upper fracture reaches the overburden after 3\u00a0years of production, only limited by the maximum inflow condition. Increasing the producing pressure with 6 MPa relative to the base case, (Fig.\u00a010(g)) means that the fracture criterion is only fulfilled once at time = 103.5 days of production, leaving a final fracture height of only \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n1\n\n\n=\n2\n.\n1\n\n m, \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n(\nt\n=\n0\ns\n)\n\n=\n2\n.\n0\n\n m. Hereafter the fracture criterion will not again be fulfilled for the rest of the production.\n\n\nThe numerical evaluations of the J-integrals for the upper and lower fracture are plotted as a function of time for the first 100 days of production for different injector pressures in Fig.\u00a011(a)\u2013(b) and different producer pressures in (c)\u2013(d). The Figure shows that the crack tip load in terms of the J-integral varies little until fracture initiation. Shortly after initiation, most curves exhibit unstable fracture growth, where J-integral values increase above 2000 J\/m\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n for the upper fracture. The fracture criterion is fulfilled when the J-integral reaches approximately 2 J\/m\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n (note that the conversion from the J-integral to a stress intensity factor is dependent on Young\u2019s modulus, which is depth dependent). For the lower fracture the J-integrals are both smaller in magnitude and exhibit shorter time of unstable fracture growth. By comparing the upper plots to the lower plots, it is seen that changes in the producer pressure vs. changes in the injector pressure leads to similar effects on the J-integral. The vertical jumps in the curves are a result of fracture updates, with ensuing instant updates of the traction force for the newly fractured element, and a delayed effect of the updated pore pressure. For the slower fracture initiations the pressure had more time to develop around the front of the crack tips is further developed around the crack front than at fracture initiation, leading to a smaller effect of continued fracture propagation on the J-integral.\n\n\n6.4\nParametric study of permeability and porosity\nA parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of increasing and decreasing the permeability of the system by a factor of two, as well as changing the chalk porosity 20%. The fracture initiation times for these cases are listed in Table\u00a04 and the flow and fracture development are plotted in Fig.\u00a012.\nChanging the permeability will change the development of the pressure as given by Darcy\u2019s law and the dramatic changes made in this parametric study must therefore change the fluid flow in the reservoir significantly. Table\u00a04 shows that the smaller permeability results in an almost double fracture initiation time, and larger permeability results in almost half the fracture initiation time. The case with smaller permeability results in much lower flow rates as can be seen in Fig.\u00a012(a), suggesting that the maximum inflow condition is not active at any time. Oppositely, for the case with double permeability, the flow rates are higher, such that the maximum inflow criterion becomes active and controls the fracture propagation for most of the 3\u00a0years of production. As a result the fracture heights are less than five metres for both fractures after three years of production.\n\n\nSince several of the material parameters are porosity dependent, it is not surprising that the largest changes in inflow\/outflow, as well as fracture propagation, occur when changing the porosity. The effects are here studied for cases with porosity of \n\n0\n.\n8\n\u00d7\n\n and \n\n1\n.\n2\n\u00d7\n\n that of the base case study. This is done by shifting the tendency line of the porosity profile in Fig.\u00a04 20% up and down. Since the permeability and undrained Young\u2019s modulus are functions of porosity they will change accordingly. The oil-percentage tendency line is fitted to measured data and will therefore not change with porosity, but since the oil saturation is known to be highly related to the porosity, the tendency curve of the oil-percentage is also shifted 20% accordingly.\nConsidering the effect on fracture initiation, the fracture criterion is never met for the case with \n\n0\n.\n8\n\u00d7\n\n porosity. The lower porosity implies lower compressibility and lower permeability. Furthermore, the stiffer material leads to less structural deformation. The fracture walls were found to be in contact at all times during the 3\u00a0years of production.\nFor the case of \n\n1\n.\n2\n\u00d7\n\n porosity the fracture criterion is already met for the first time-step. This means that the critical injector pressure in this case is below 38 MPa. The fracture initiation time of 4.6 days in Table\u00a04 is caused by the higher flow rates, such that the rates exceed the maximum flow until this point in time (see also Fig.\u00a012(e)). The higher permeability following the higher porosity shows the same effects on the flow and fracture propagation as in Fig.\u00a012(c).\nTo further investigate how the change in porosity affects the critical pressure, the critical pressures for the upper and lower fracture are plotted for six different scalings of the porosity in Fig.\u00a013. The figure shows an significant impact on the initial pressure when changing the porosity. Lowering the porosity increases the critical pressure, which is mainly caused by the consequent increase in initial stress. Lowering the porosity also changes the difference between the critical fracture for the two fracture tips. Two factors play a role in this matter; gravitation and the functionally graded material (FGM) properties. The larger solid volume fraction when decreasing the porosity implies larger gravitational effects, making the difference between the critical pressures larger for the upward and downward fracture tips. Conversely, by lowering the porosity the gradient of Young\u2019s modulus with depth becomes smaller, and the FGM-properties tend to decrease the difference between the two fracture tips. From the figure it is seen that the effect of gravity is larger than the counteracting FGM-effect, except for the \n\n0\n.\n7\n\u00d7\n\n scale of the porosity, where the difference between the two fracture tips decreases (slightly) when increasing the porosity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nResum\u00e9\nA coupled Finite Element Model was created to predict injection fracturing in the subsurface. The specific case concerns an oil field, where material and production input data resemble realistic field conditions in the North Sea. The reservoir rock type is chalk, which is known to have high porosity, low permeability and a low fracture toughness. Ideal poroelasticity is assumed and the long parallel well pattern means that 2D plane strain conditions apply. Flow between long horizontal wells of alternating injectors and producers at 200\u00a0metre intervals at approximately 2 km depth is analysed.\nThe symmetries of the problem enables a reduced model to be considered including a single injector and a single producer. Porosity typically reduces with depth and is graded according to stratigraphy. All material parameters that are derived from the porosity were accordingly functionally graded with the depth. The changes in oil percentage, density, viscosity, bulk modulus and the permeability for the existing and injected fluid were accounted for, by updating the material data after sweep by the injected water. The sweep was tracked via a particle traced frontline. The fluid flow was modelled by Darcy\u2019s law, along with the pressure gradient from the injector (over-pressure relative to initial pressure) to the producer (under-pressure relative to initial pressure).\nThe symmetrical rock deformation implies growth of vertical fractures, which were modelled by linear elastic fracture mechanics accounting for maximum inflow rate as an additional constraint.\nThe model has the capacity to simulate fracture propagation in the vertical plane, within an array of producing and injecting horizontal wells. This configuration is relevant for any reservoir system undergoing production and injection simultaneously, e.g.\u00a0for the purpose of producing hydrocarbons, thermal energy, fresh water, or for the storage of CO2.\n\n\n7.2\nConclusion\nA key conclusion of this study was that the state of stress and the fracture growth is affected by flow in the entire reservoir, and thereby the producers in a line drive are critical to the fracture process. By operating below a critical pressure, defined as the pressure where the fracture starts propagating at initial conditions, the producers ensures that fracture growth is constrained to the vertical plane at the injector position.\nThe critical pressure was found numerically for an initial fracture height of 2 m for the upper and lower fracture. For the base case, the critical pressures were found to be 41.9 MPa for the upper fracture and 42.7 for the lower fracture. These values are significantly higher than the initial pore pressure of approximately 28.9 MPa, and higher than the initial stress level with a total horizontal stress around 39 MPa. For the upper fracture for pressures below the critical pressure, the fracture walls were found to be in contact across the symmetry line. This implies that the fracture walls open, when the fracture criterion is met for the upper fracture.\nA simulation base case simulating 20\u00a0years of production with an injector pressure of 38 MPa (below the critical pressure of 41.9 MPa) and a producer pressure of 10 MPa, showed a fracture initiation time of 23.8 days. After 6.01\u00a0years the fracture stopped propagating. At this time the upper fracture has reached the overburden with a fracture height of r=50 m, and the lower fracture stops at a fracture depth of 31.4 m. After 17\u00a0years of production water-break-through occurs, as the injector fluid reaches the producer.\nThrough parametric studies it is concluded that the producer and injector pressures have a large influence on fracture initiation time and the ensuing fracture propagation. Equal changes (but opposite in sign) in producer pressure and injector pressure had almost identical effects suggesting that it is the pressure difference between the producer and injector that controls the fracture. This is expected as the pressure differential is a proxy for the loading of the rock that causes the displacements and the fracture opening. For pressure differences less than 18 MPa between the injector and producer pressure, there was found no fracture growth. For large pressure differences unstable fracture growth is seen with larger flows in the system. By reducing the producer pressure or increasing the injector pressure with 4 MPa compared to the base case study leads to fracture propagation mainly being controlled by the max inflow condition and both the upper and lower fracture will reach the reservoir limits (over- and under-burden) within the first 3.5\u00a0years of production.\nChanging the permeability in the model directly influence the predicted pressure propagation in the system. Lowering the permeability leads to earlier fracture initiation and vice versa.\nChanging the porosity in the model affects the simulations significantly by changing the flow and fracture initiation times. Furthermore, this turned out to have a major effect on the value of the critical pressure. A higher porosity leads to an earlier fracture initiation, but a slower growing fracture caused by the increase in flow in the system (caused by an increase in permeability). On the other hand lowering the permeability to \n\n0\n.\n8\n\u00d7\n\n the original values prevented fracture initiation completely, by increasing the stiffness in the system and increasing the critical pressure as well.\nThe study further raised several questions which would be relevant to address in further studies.\n\n\n\n\u2022\nBy including the transient flow in the fracture in the model a flow boundary condition could be applied instead of a pressure boundary condition resulting in a more realistic pressure and leak-off boundary condition.\n\n\n\u2022\nThis model uses the assumption, that the fracture does not penetrate through the upper- and lower layers. As it is critically important to understand the containment and what ensures the integrity of the overburden, a natural extension is to include the overburden explicitly in the model.\n\n\n\u2022\nConcerning the material modelling, Biot\u2019s coefficient, \n\u03b1\n, is assumed constant in this study, but other studies have shown a relationship between Biot\u2019s modulus and the porosity. Biot\u2019s coefficient decreases with porosity (see\u00a0\n32\n), and it is of significant interest to investigate how this coupling affects the growth downwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJ.L.

The development of both systems, by altering initial pore pressure, will change the stress state of the host rock and may induce seismic activity. The quantification of the critical stress state is of importance for identifying suitable and safe areas for the efficient utilization of geothermal energy resources. To investigate the stress state, three elements have to be addressed: (i) undisturbed initial in situ stress state, (ii) rock\u2019s and fault\u2019s failure criteria, and (iii) man-made spatio-temporal pore pressure changes due to during drilling, fluid injection, or production operations.\n2\n The two latter elements are a focus of many scientific studies\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a03\u20135), whereas the quantification of the undisturbed in situ stress state remains most often highly uncertain.\n3D geomechanical models, providing critical a priori in situ stress tensor information, are used for safe and sustainable exploration and exploitation of geothermal and hydrocarbon resources\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a06\u201310). Examples include applications for (i) predicting borehole stability\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a011\u201313), (ii) selecting drill paths and drilling targets\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a014, 15), (iii) designing reservoir stimulation operations\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a016, 17), (iv) assessing reactivation potential of fractures and faults\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a04, 18), (v) addressing reservoir depletion\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a019, 20, (vi) evaluating compaction, subsidence, and casing shear issues\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a021\u201323), and (vii) investigating hazards related to induced seismicity\u00a0(e.g., Ref.\u00a024).\nThroughout the 700-yearlong coal exploration period in the Ruhr region, an abundance of geological, geophysical, and in situ stress data has been obtained from the Carboniferous strata up to depths crucial for the coal mining industry. In this study, we take advantage of this unique dataset for development of a static 3D geomechanical model to predict the spatially continuous distribution of in situ stress state and evaluate the reactivation risk of major fault zones. The model, with a total area of 827km2 is located in the central part of the Ruhr region and reaches vertical depths of 6km. For the calibration of the numerical model developed with COMSOL Multiphysics software,\n25\n we use a comprehensive model-independent dataset including (i) geophysical logging results, (ii) in situ measurements of horizontal stress magnitudes, and (iii) borehole deformation analyses. Additionally, results from the fault-slip analysis, distribution of microseismicity, subsidence, and localized permeability indicators from coal mining were utilized to confirm model robustness.\n\n\n2\nStudy area\n\n2.1\nGeological setting and paleostress\nThe Ruhr region (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany), located to the north of the Rhenohercynian Massif, is a result of the Hercynian orogeny and a classical foreland basin\u00a0(e.g., Ref.\u00a026). It consists mainly of interbedded sequences of sand, clay, silt, and coal layers (i.e.,\u00a0cyclothemes) of Upper Carboniferous age. The coal-bearing Upper Carboniferous strata in the Ruhr region is divided into the stratigraphic units of Namurian C to Westphalian A\u2013C\u00a0(e.g., Ref.\u00a027). The folded layers of the Upper Carboniferous are overlain by a weakly north-dipping, angular unconformity from the Upper Cretaceous. The southern limit of the Cretaceous layers is along the line of the cities Essen, Bochum, and Dortmund. Towards the north, the layers of Cretaceous age increase continuously in thickness until finally reaching about 1.8km thickness in the M\u00fcnsterland Cretaceous Basin\u00a0(e.g., Ref.\u00a028). In total, the thickness of the coal-bearing strata is about 2.9km. In the South of the Ruhr region, at the margin of the Rhenohercynian Massif, Devonian carbonates are assumed to be present below the coal-bearing Upper Carboniferous strata at a depth of about 5km.\n29\n\n\nThe Ruhr region is dominated by two sets of regional fault zones oriented (i) NW-SE to NNW-SSE with dip angles \n\u2265\n 80\u00b0 and (ii) NE-SW with dip angles between 60 and 80\u00b0\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a026, 30). Highly complex fold structures with a mean ENE-WSW strike direction are also observed in the region\u00a0(e.g., Ref.\u00a031).\n\n\nOutcrop studies in the south Ruhr region have shown that in the Devonian carbonates similar discontinuity orientations as in the coal-bearing Upper Carboniferous strata can be expected.\n35\n As an example, in the outcrops of the Steltenberg quarry (Fig.\u00a01a), mesoscale fault zones encompass several bed-perpendicular and sub-parallel faults. The shear displacement is observed from the offset of bed boundaries and\/or slickensides. The first fault network comprises of large sub-horizontal ENE-WSW-striking thrust fault, which dips approximately 20 to 35\u00b0 to the bedding and is 3 to 5m wide. Intensely fractured rocks with cores defined by high-strain fault rocks, including non-cohesive and cohesive crush breccia, characterize the narrow-range damage zones of this fault zone (Fig.\u00a02f, g, h), which is expected to be a subsidiary of the Ennepe thrust developed during the Hercynian orogeny.\n36\n\n,\n\n37\n The second fault network is NNW-SSE-striking, has a high dip (from 60 to 75\u00b0), and is six times wider (40m) than the ENE-WSW-striking network, locally reaching 50m (Fig.\u00a02a, b). The inner core contains 5m thick clay gouge and\/or cohesive crush breccias. The NNW-SSE fault network forms in a conjugate pattern as a result of the NW-SE acting sub-horizontal compression (Fig.\u00a02c, d, e), and overprints the ENE-WSW-striking fault network (Fig.\u00a02a).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nPast geomechanical studies\nThe in situ stress state of the Ruhr region was investigated in a few surveys, performed predominantly in its northern parts with hydrofracturing and overcoring methods (Fig.\u00a03). Measurements were carried out from the 1970s to the 2000s to optimize the design of crosscuts and mine layouts and, later on, to evaluate stress state in coal bed methane wells\u00a0(i.e., Refs.\u00a039\u201345). Most of the in situ measurements in the Ruhr region were limited to depths of interest for the coal mining industry (i.e.,\u00a0\n\u223c\n1.5km).\nIn the last 40\u00a0years more than 1000 modern exploration boreholes were drilled in the northern part of the Ruhr region.\n46\n This immense database allowed for detailed analysis of borehole elongations and interpretation of the maximum horizontal stress azimuth, \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax. A total length of 761m of borehole breakouts from 3.95km of analysed four-arm caliper logs in 40 boreholes spread across the Ruhr region were analysed by\u00a0Ref.\u00a040. The mean \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax from his study is 149\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036\u00b0.\u00a0Reinecker et al.\n47\n discriminated borehole breakouts in 51 boreholes in the Ruhr region with a total breakout length of 3.01km. The length-weighted \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax amounted to 168\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00b0. The great majority of \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax data in the Ruhr region is of low quality (i.e.,\u00a0D and E quality category of stress indicator based on World Stress Map stress quality ranking) and, thus, less reliable.\n48\n Only a few measurements of higher quality (i.e.,\u00a0B and C quality category of stress indicator) were registered in the region. Few measurements, from which the majority being of low quality, indicate NE-SW orientation of \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax, and being, thus, perpendicular to the regional \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax.\n49\n\n\nBased on the existing data, the Ruhr region can be separated into two main stress units in terms of \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax with the boundary being located at the General Blumenthal mine (Fig.\u00a03). The eastern stress unit is characterized by \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax transition from the NNW-SSE direction in its most eastern parts (i.e.,\u00a0mine Westfalen) to NW-SE direction at the location of Haus Aden and Heinrich-Robert mines. These \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax are likely to be the result of regional faulting of the coal-bearing strata.\n44\n The western stress unit is characterized by \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax ranging from N-S direction at the location of Lohberg and General Blumenthal mines, and then reorientation from NNW-SSE to NW-SE direction at the location of Friedrich Heinrich and Niederberg mines. These \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax are supposedly influenced by the graben structure of the Lower Rhine Bay.\n44\n Based on results from in situ stress testing by\u00a0Refs.\u00a040\u201345 it can be stated that the Ruhr region is dominated by a strike-slip regime with magnitude of minimum horizontal stress, S\nhmin, being smaller than the vertical stress magnitude, S\nv. No natural seismicity has been recorded in the Ruhr region to derive the stress regime from focal mechanisms.\n50\n\n,\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nSimulation approach\nTo simulate the 3D state of the in situ stress a two-step approach following the methodology developed in\u00a0Refs.\u00a07, 52 was utilized. As a first step, the initial stress state, in the absence of tectonic loading, was established. This procedure, which ensures an appropriate ratio of horizontal-to-vertical effective stresses, was performed assuming no lateral tectonic loading with vertical and lateral stresses being controlled by gravitational forces only. Effective horizontal stresses, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n, being represented by a function of body forces of the cumulative weight of the overlying model layers and their Poisson\u2019s ratios, \n\u03bd\n, which, according to the principles of linear elasticity amount to \n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n)\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nwhere, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n is the effective vertical stress. During gravity generation, undesirable gravity-induced settlement occurs within the model volume. To remove these displacements, the stress state with the gravity-induced settlement was implemented into an undeformed model, and with two equilibration iteration steps (with results from a first iteration being used as a starting point in the second iteration), gravitational displacements were removed. In the last iteration, displacements were minimized to a few centimetres with maximum displacements reaching few metres.\nOnce the initial stress state was equilibrated with gravitational forces and gravity-driven subsidence removed, in a second step, kinematic boundary conditions were applied onto the model boundaries to reproduce the effect of tectonic forces. Kinematic boundary conditions were applied in a form of pre-described displacements with an assumption of drained loading and with fault zones being represented as 2D planes of weakness with lower stiffness properties in respect to the rock mass.\nTo discretize the numerical solution, the high complexity of the heavily faulted and folded structures of the region and inhomogeneous rock mass properties was resolved with the finite element method (FEM). The 3D geomechanical model was described using a partial differential equation of the force equilibrium.\nAfter an initial model was solved, numerical results had to be calibrated prior to their interpretation and application. As proven by\u00a0Ref.\u00a06, the quality of 3D geomechanical models depends not necessarily on the simulation technique but the amount and quality of calibration data. Therefore, the concept developed in this study uses a comprehensive calibration dataset, independent of input data, and validates it against the numerical results. The calibration data points were adjusted in reasonable limits until discrepancies with numerical results were minimized and a best-fit model was achieved. The input data includes basic model assumptions, model geometry, rock mass and fault zone properties, initial stress, and boundary conditions, whereas the calibration dataset includes magnitudes of S\nv, S\nhmin, S\nHmax, and \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax acquired from in situ measurements. This first step concerns calibrating the orientation of the applied boundary stresses by comparing \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax obtained from in situ measurements. In the second step, S\nv magnitudes obtained from geophysical logging are calibrated against simulated S\nv values. The third step assumes, calibrating magnitudes of both S\nhmin and S\nHmax acquired from in situ measurement by varying pre-described kinematic displacement conditions. As the variety of displacement boundary conditions exist for calibration of a single S\nhmin value, there is only one pair of displacement boundary conditions that fits both horizontal stress magnitudes.\n2\n The mean error, \n\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\u00af\n\n\n, between simulated and calibration value was computed as \n\n(2)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\u00af\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nl\n\n\n\u2223\n\n\nS\n\n\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\u02c6\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\u2223\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere, l is the number of data points, S\ni is the calibration value and \u015c\ni is the simulated value.\nOnce the numerical simulation was successfully calibrated, several scalar values, besides the direct results of the simulation, including (i) \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax, (ii) regime stress ratio (RSR),\n53\n and fault-specific parameters such as (iii) shear, \n\u03c4\n, and (iv) normal effective stresses, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n,\n54\n (v) slip tendency, T\ns,\n55\n (vi) dilatation tendency, T\nd,\n56\n and (vii) Coulomb failure function, CFF,\n57\n were computed. In addition to the model calibration with acquired in situ data, results from fault-slip analysis, distribution of subsidence,\n38\n induced seismicity (Ref.\u00a050; Fischer, K.D. pers. comm.), and indications of fault permeability from coal mining activities\n58\n\n,\n\n59\n in the Ruhr region were used to confirm the reliability of the numerical results.\n\n\n4\nModel setup\n\n4.1\n3D structural-geological model\nThe base of any subsurface numerical modelling is a 3D structural-geological model. For this purpose, eight stratigraphic units, based on the CICM (Coal Inventory Calculation Model) model\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a060, 61), were acquired from the Geological Survey of the North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) in the MOVE software.\n62\n The stratigraphic units are Quaternary, Cretaceous, Westphalian C1, B1, A2, and A1, Namurian CB, Namurian AB, Lower Carboniferous, and Devonian. 20 major fault zones were implemented in the 3D structural-geological model. The architecture of fault zones was extracted from geological maps, geological cross-sections, and geometries of stratigraphic units. Considering results from the deep seismic reflection and the implications from studies in Devonian quarries in the south of the Ruhr region, a continuous fault direction (i.e.,\u00a0NW-SE, NNW-SSE, and NE-SW) down to the bottom of the model was assumed.\n29\n\n,\n\n35\n\n,\n\n63\n\n\nFor data handling purposes and computational efficiency, simplifications to the model geometry were made accepting resolution losses. This resulted in merged stratigraphic units of Quaternary, Cretaceous, and Westphalian layers called later Westphalian and geometry simplification of the stratigraphic horizons. This was due to (i) degenerating or intersecting layer elements, (ii) layer thickness being too small to accommodate effective model discretization, or iii) layers having relatively similar mechanical properties. In addition, few of the imported fault zones were shortened, mainly at fault intersections and model boundaries, due to discretization issues and\/or degenerate elements. The 3D structural-geological model and its implementation into the FEM environment is presented in Fig.\u00a01.\n\n\n4.2\nRock mass properties\nBulk density, \n\u03c1\n\nB, static Young\u2019s modulus, E\ns, and Poisson\u2019s ratio, \n\u03bd\n, were selected to define the rock mass properties (Table\u00a01). Static properties of the Carboniferous rock mass were derived from geophysical logging results (i.e.,\u00a0P-wave velocity log) from the M\u00fcnsterland-1 borehole.\n28\n Gardner\u2019s relation\n64\n was applied to acquire \n\u03c1\n\nB values of specific lithostratigraphic units. E\ns values were obtained from correlation of P-wave velocity results from the M\u00fcnsterland-1 borehole and destructive laboratory tests on a range of Upper Carboniferous rocks (i.e.,\u00a0sandstones, siltstones, and shales) from the Ruhr region.\n65\n Poisson\u2019s ratio values were recomputed based on the P- to S-wave ratio acquired from geophysical logging results from a middle-deep exploration borehole in the south-eastern part of the model area. For the Devonian unit, results from laboratory studies by\u00a0Ref.\u00a035 were utilized with static values recomputed from correlations by\u00a0Ref.\u00a066.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nBoundary conditions and fault zone implementation\nThe model volume is 36.9km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a022.4km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.0km. The model coordinate system is aligned with the mean \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax of the central part of the Ruhr region. To reproduce the effects of plate tectonics pre-described displacements were applied orthogonally onto the model, assuming the main tectonic compression from the Alpine Front.\n68\n The southern model boundary was displaced (i.e.,\u00a0shortened) by 66m while the eastern and western boundaries were displaced (i.e.,\u00a0elongated) by 2m each. No displacements were allowed in the direction perpendicular to the northern model boundary, however, a movement in a tangential direction of this boundary was allowed. The bottom of the model was fixed in z-direction allowing for horizontal displacements. The top of the model remained free of constraints.\n\nFor the computation of effective stress values, constant Biot\u2019s coefficient of 0.65\n69\n and a P\np gradient of 10.8MPa km\u22121, recomputed from density of mine waters sampled across the Ruhr region\n70\n and drilling fluid densities applied in boreholes,\n57\n analysed in this study (Fig.\u00a04), were assumed.\nFault zones control the mechanical and fluid-flow properties of the Earth\u2019s upper crust\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a071\u201373). There, semi-brittle shear zones or pre-existing or early formed brittle structures locally perturb the stress state and dominate the process of fault development.\n74\u201376\n As fault zones grow, progressive shearing and interaction of the inherited structures control slip zones and slip surfaces, which are accommodated in the fault cores and damage zones, and, in return, affect the near-fault host rock properties and generate stress perturbations.\n77\u201380\n In 3D geomechanical modelling, the term fault zone is often used to refer to a 2D plane along which concentration of deformation with a known shear sense of movement. Fault zones were incorporated into the model volume as distinct 2D planes of weakness with specific stiffness properties. This was performed by deeming fault zones as thin elastic layers, which is a common assumption in modelling of thin or high aspect-ratio structures sandwiched between other relatively low aspect-ratio structures in FEM environments, and a common consideration in many geomechanical modelling studies\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a04, 81\u201385). On interior boundaries, a thin elastic layer decouples displacements between the two sides of the boundary. The two sides are then connected by elastic forces with equal size but opposite directions, proportional to the relative displacements and velocities \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\nn\n\n\u2192\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\nu\n\n\u2192\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n is the effective stress tensor, \n\n\nn\n\n\u2192\n\n is a normal vector of the boundary of the model, \n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n is the spring constant in a normal and tangential direction, and \n\n\nu\n\n\u2192\n\n is the displacement vector composed of the displacement on each side of the fault zone.\nStudies by\u00a0Ref.\u00a086 on fractured Opalinus Clay formations indicated that Young\u2019s modulus of a fault zone can vary by several orders of magnitude between fault core and host rock and can approach values as low as 0.1GPa for clay-filled faults. The fault-specific properties cannot be measured and are rarely investigated under laboratory conditions. As a consequence, there is a lack of fault-specific properties to populate 3D geomechanical models. The fault-specific properties will also change from fault to fault and along a trace of one particular fault. In the light of the above arguments, fault stiffness properties, estimated from an assumption of constant fault thickness and elastic properties of a clay gouge, were assumed constant across the model and amounted to a normal stiffness of 0.17MPa\n\n\nmm\n\n\n\u22121, and shear stiffness of 0.06MPa\n\n\nmm\n\n\n\u22121. For an assessment of fault reactivation risk, all faults were deemed cohesionless. The coefficient of sliding friction, \n\u03bc\n, ranging between 0.5, as a lower bound, and 0.7, as an upper bound, was assumed for the Carboniferous layers.\n5\n\n,\n\n87\u201390\n For Devonian layer \n\u03bc\n between 0.6, as a lower bound, and 0.8, as an upper bound\n91\n\n,\n\n92\n was assumed.\n\n\n4.4\nModel discretization and calibration\nThe numerical model volume was discretized with a minimum and maximum element size of 130 and 800m, respectively. Tetrahedron elements were selected due to their flexibility to describe complex 3D geometries. The model is discretized into 1.7 million tetrahedral elements. The average element quality amounts to 0.65, where 0.0 represents a degenerated element and 1.0 represents a completely symmetric element. Fault zones were discretized by 81000 triangles with an average element quality of 0.87.\nThe calibration of \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax was performed with four borehole breakout measurements from\u00a0Ref.\u00a047, five borehole breakout measurements from this study, and one measurement from hydrofracturing measurements.\n45\n Collected \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax measurements represent stress indicator quality between C and E\n48\n (Fig.\u00a04). The A to C stress indicator quality measurements only amounted to \n\n\u0394\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\nH\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n of 6.2 \n\n\u00b1\n7\n.\n0\n\u00b0\n\n. As discussed before, few \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax measurements, located in the modelled area, are oriented perpendicular to the regional \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax.\n49\n These measurements were deemed to be misinterpretations of analysed borehole breakouts and, by rotating them 90\u00b0, were added to the calibration dataset. The overall \n\n\u0394\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\nH\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n, based on A to E stress indicator quality measurements, amounted to 16.2 \n\n\u00b1\n16\n.\n5\n\u00b0\n\n. For the calibration of S\nv magnitude, results of rock bulk density from geophysical logging in ten boreholes with depths between 0.4 to 1.8km within the Carboniferous layers were utilized (Fig.\u00a04). The match between calibration and modelled values amounted to \n\n\u0394\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n1\n.\n04\n\u00b1\n\n 0.8MPa. One pair of S\nhmin and S\nHmax measurement was available within the model volume.\n45\n This hydrofracturing measurement was performed at depth of 975m in the area of the former General Blumenthal mine. The measurement indicated a strike-slip stress regime with S\nhmin\n\n<\n\nS\nv\n\n<\n\nS\nHmax and k-value of 1.53. Overall, a satisfactory agreement between modelled and calibration data for measurement was achieved (Fig.\u00a04).\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\n3D in situ Stress Tensor\nResults of the calibrated 3D geomechanical model are presented in Figs.\u00a05 and 6. The regime stress ratio (RSR) varies depending on the lithostratigraphic units horizontally and laterally (Fig.\u00a06). A strike-slip to transpressive regime dominates at the surface, predominantly in the Westphalian layer (1.51 \u00b10.45), and changes with depth to a more transtensional regime (Namurian C, B and Devonian layers with RSR of 1.13 \u00b10.22, 1.12 \u00b10.18, and 1.27 \u00b10.40, respectively), that prevails at greater depths. Local changes from transtension to transpression were observed mainly in the Lower Carboniferous layer with RSR of 1.90 \u00b10.32. The modelled RSR values do not exceed, on average, 2.2. Furthermore, an increase of RSR value in the vicinity of fault zones is observed.\n\n\nHigher S\nHmax\/S\nhmin ratios and differential stresses are observed at greater depths in comparison with the upper-most Westphalian and Namurian layers, as well as for the central (i.e.,\u00a0the vicinity of Bottrop and Oberhausen) and north-western (i.e.,\u00a0area of the Prosper-Haniel mine) parts of the model where the Devonian units are deeper than in the southern sections. Such a pattern highlights a potential trend of increased differential stress towards the north-western Ruhr region. Areas with lowest differential stresses and S\nHmax\/S\nhmin ratios are observed in the south-east of the model area, close to the city of Bochum. Higher differential stress concentration is visible in the proximity of fault zones, especially around their curves and tips. This proves that the state of stress could be dominated by the fault architecture and is an important observation for the interpretation of fault-adjacent in situ stress measurements in a more regional context. A generalization can be made, that synclines represent areas of increased differential stresses, whereas anticlines present the opposite, which has been extensively observed and discussed in the literature\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a093, 94). \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax in the modelled area ranges between NW-SE and NNE-SSW direction. In the vicinity of NW-SE striking fault zones \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax reorients counterclockwise (from the N\u2013S direction) and in the vicinity of NE-SW fault zones, it reorients clockwise (from the N\u2013S direction). The rotation of \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax with depth is observed especially in the vicinity of faults and along anticlines (clockwise) and synclines (counterclockwise). Similar phenomena have been observed in the literature\u00a0(e.g., Ref.\u00a095).\nAs an example, in Fig.\u00a05 (a), (d), and (g) numerical results of in situ stress state for the reservoir depth of 5km were presented. Based on these figures, it can observed that the S\nHmax\/S\nhmin ratio at this depth varies between approximately 1.7 and 2.1. The differential stresses at 5km depth vary on average between 80 and 130MPa, with some localized increases up to 180MPa. \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax at 5km depth is relatively homogeneous and varies between 170 and 180\u00b0.\n\n\n5.2\nFault-specific parameters\nComparison of the reactivation potential pattern in 3D with the frictional resistance of a fault zone can provide a useful constraint on the probability of its reactivation. Faults or fault segments, where the calculated ratio of shear to effective normal stress overcomes the frictional resistance are considered as potential locations of reactivation. The high dependence of T\ns, T\nd and CFF on the fault architecture and prevailing in situ stress state is displayed in Fig.\u00a06, where colder colours present lower values and hotter colours presenting the opposite.\nIt would be incorrect to expect that one value of \n\u03bc\n will accurately represent frictional properties of all faults confined within the numerical model of such a great extent. The methodology applied in this study compares numerical results against a range of possible frictional coefficients, expected in a given lithostratigraphic unit. For a case of T\ns being higher than the upper limit on the slip threshold, that particular fault zone can be considered as reactivation prone. Statistical distribution of T\ns, T\nd, and CFF grouped into NW-SE to NNW-SSE (left) and NE-SW (right) striking fault zones is presented in Fig.\u00a07. One can observe that the great majority of the NW-SE to NNW-SSE striking fault zones can be considered as being close to the critical state (with T\ns median of 0.40) and open (with T\nd median of 0.67) in the prevailing in situ stress configuration (Fig.\u00a07). The NE-SW striking faults, on the other hand, could be considered as \u201clocked\u201d under prevailing in situ stress state and impermeable (with T\ns median of 0.32 and T\nd median of 0.31). Based on the lower limit of \n\u03bc\n (i.e.,\u00a00.5\u20130.6) around 16% of all NW-SE to NNW-SSE striking fault segments can be considered active (i.e.,\u00a0with CFF\n\n\u2265\n 0), in comparison to 5% for the NE-SW striking fault segments. Assuming an upper limit on \n\u03bc\n (i.e.,\u00a00.7\u20130.8), 2% of all NW-SE to NNW-SSE and only 0.2% of NE-SW striking fault segments can be considered as active.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nStress rotation\nA few \u201cunexpected\u201d \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax re-orientations, striking approximately 90\u00b0 from the regional \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax, were observed from borehole breakout analysis within the modelled area. These \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax rotations, which by adding 90\u00b0 were eventually added to the calibration dataset, could not be explained with the results of this model. It is, thus, expected that such \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax re-orientations could be related to either (i) wrongly reported reading from the caliper tool, (ii) mistakenly picked borehole breakouts (i.e.,\u00a0extended drilling-induced tensile fractures in weak layers, collapsed preexisting open fractures or filter cake along caved zones picked instead of borehole breakouts), or (iii) a near-isotropic horizontal stress state which would cause significant rotations of stress due to small local stress sources.\n7\n\n,\n\n96\n As the latter hypothesis based on the available in situ stress data from the region\u00a0(i.e., Refs.\u00a039\u201345) and being supported by the results from the numerical model presented in this study, can be excluded only (i) and (ii) are to be expected as potential reasons for 90\u00b0 rotation of \n\u03b8\n\nSHmax.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2\nModel reliability\nUncertainties introduced by the input data constitute of (i) basic model assumptions, (ii) rock mass and (iii) fault zone properties, (iv) the geometry of fault zones and lithostratigraphic horizons, (v) initial stress, and (vi) boundary conditions. The developed model suffers from simplifications, which may pose limitations to its applicability. This can be attributed to the fact that the majority of used data, being it input or validation, comes exclusively from the Upper Carboniferous strata, which was of primary interest to the coal mining industry in the region. Deeper formations were, until now, of no interest and, as a result, no data is available from these layers. The model reliability can be, thus, considered much higher in Upper Carboniferous units than in the Lower Carboniferous and Devonian units.\nOne of the core model unknowns remains the uncertainty of the existence of Devonian layers underlying the Carboniferous strata across the Ruhr region. The only indication of such comes from interpretations of the DEKORP 2-N seismic line.\n29\n\n,\n\n63\n\n,\n\n97\n Besides, fault zone geometry at greater depths remains uncertain. Except for a few seismic events in the north-western part of the model area located below 3km aligning with the fault surface traces\n50\n and an outcrop study by\u00a0Ref.\u00a035, which proved similar orientation of discontinuities in the Devonian and Carboniferous units, there are no clear proof of the fault zones existence below Carboniferous layers. The presence and architecture of implemented fault zones may, in reality, differ from the ones constructed in the model, which is especially the case for the deeper subsurface. The assumptions made in this study shall be validated with 3D seismic surveys and results from deep exploration drilling campaigns in the region. Additionally, shortening of the fault zones at fault intersections, as carried out in this study, could have a significant effect on the state of stress. The quantification of this effect was limited by the FEM software in use and should be investigated in future studies.\nSimplifications to the model geometry were performed primarily for maintaining model practicability and for accommodating limitations of the FEM software. Implemented formation horizons represent lithostratigraphic units and not specific rock types, which is due to the highly complex geology of the Carboniferous units composed of cyclothems. These highly complex stratigraphic sequences pose significant challenges during discretization, solving, and population of the numerical model with properties. As a consequence, to analyse the in situ stress state in a more regional context, some degree of homogenization of rock strata based on e.g.,\u00a0stiffness contrasts, as performed in this study, will always have to be applied in the Ruhr region.\nAn assumption of constant Poisson\u2019s ratio for the Upper Carboniferous layers, based on geophysical logging results, should be considered as a big simplification of the subsurface conditions. In reality, elastic properties of the Upper Carboniferous layers will vary significantly, due to the strong interbedding of rocks with much different elastic properties (i.e.,\u00a0cyclothems). Additionally, an assumption of constant Biot\u2019s coefficient throughout the whole model should be also considered as a big simplification. For the mitigation of uncertainties in the future geomechanical modelling efforts, it is advised to prioritize the above-mentioned properties, desirably in reservoir-specific conditions.\nMore than 700\u00a0years of hard coal extraction superimposed a significantly different secondary stress field in the Ruhr region. This is due to e.g.,\u00a0S\nv decrease from a significant amount of rock withdrawal, P\np fluctuations due to mine water pumping, or slip on preexisting and\/or newly created faults and\/or fractures. The influence of coal mining is difficult to assess. This is mainly due to the vast extend the mining industry was present in the region and the requirement of detailed information on the location of the subsurface infrastructure and its current state (i.e.,\u00a0if mine is left empty, flooded, or cemented). This goes much beyond the scope of this study.\nDue to the ongoing mine water pumping activates in the Ruhr region, water table levels in the subsurface have been significantly reduced. Currently average water table level in coal mines amounts to approximately 600m,\n98\n\n,\n\n99\n where in some cases water level reduced to 1.2km were observed (www.bid.rag.de). Such significant differences in mine water table levels will cause pore pressure changes and result in a decrease in reactivation potential of major fault zones. As a consequence, the effect of P\np changes on the in situ stress state in the Ruhr region cannot be regarded as marginal and shall be investigated prior to the development of a deep geothermal system therein. This is especially true for locations in the vicinity of the former coal mines or mine water pumping stations. It remains, also, not clear if or to what extend stress magnitudes used for the model calibration were affected by coal mining activates.\nIt shall be emphasized, that the assumption of a homogeneous fluid pressure gradient should be considered a significant simplification of the pore pressure field in the study area. In large and faulted domains like the one represented in our model, significant fluid pressure differences (due to the influence of e.g.,\u00a0topography, fault zones, and\/or rock mass heterogeneities) are expected. Such differences will undoubtedly affect the stability of the fault planes and, therefore, provide different results from the ones presented with our model. The simplified approach used in our study can be reasoned by the lack of reliable hydraulic properties of the rock layers and fault zones at depth which would introduce a set of uncertainties as well as a relatively minor influence of topography. As a result, a homogeneous pore pressure field, although being apriori incorrect, in our case is the best approximation.\n\n\n6.3\nUncertainty quantification\nTo be able to quantify the reliability of the numerical model, a method developed in\u00a0Ref.\u00a06 was applied. Using this approach, the mean T\ns value for all modelled fault zones, for which variability was introduced by the uncertainties of the rock mass, fault zone properties, and calibration data, was recomputed. For the sake of simplicity, the basic model assumptions, boundary conditions, model geometry (i.e.,\u00a0the architecture of horizons and faults), and initial stress conditions were deemed as invariable. T\ns was computed for several model scenarios in which the extreme values of the range of uncertainties of the input and calibration parameters were used. This allowed deriving the individual impact of specific model parameters and quantify ones that are the most crucial. The results of T\ns for each model scenario were subsequently compared to the mean T\ns from the best-fit model. Across the Ruhr region, fault zones will have much different stiffness properties depending on their filling type, which can range from carbonate material (e.g.,\u00a0calcite), being much stiffer than the host rock, to sulfides or clay minerals, being significantly more elastic.\n35\n\n,\n\n100\n To represent the most extreme case of fault filling material stiffness in the Ruhr region, a case of a fault filled with carbonate material with a normal and tangential stiffness of 7.39MPa\n\n\nmm\n\n\n\u22121 and 1.88MPa\n\n\nmm\n\n\n\u22121, respectively, were assumed. As proven by\u00a0Refs.\u00a02, 101, 102, uncertainties related to the model calibration with multiple available S\nhmin and S\nHmax pairs may be significant. Unfortunately, due to only one pair of horizontal stresses with the detailed location being available within the modelled area, uncertainties related to the model calibration could not be properly assessed. To showcase the impact of the calibration process on the model results, the S\nHmax magnitude (property ever-burdened with a high uncertainty)\n17\n was recalculated based on the frictional faulting theory\n54\n assuming a strike-slip faulting regime, S\nhmin magnitude from\u00a0Ref.\u00a045 and an upper bound on \n\u03bc\n of 0.7 for Upper Carboniferous units.\n5\n\n,\n\n87\u201389\n Computations with these assumptions amounted to a k-value and S\nHmax values of 57.3MPa and 1.68, respectively. The calibration of the numerical model was then initiated with the new data and T\ns uncertainty evaluated. The variations introduced by the independent model parameters were added together and led to a combined T\ns variability of \u00b10.1 with the main source of variability resulting from the rock mass properties.\n\n\n6.4\nModel validation\n\n6.4.1\nValidation against fault-slip data\nTwo similar striation sets were observed on analysed fault surfaces in the Steltenberg quarry (Fig.\u00a02i, j, k). One of them displays a horizontal component of the movement in the same direction as that of the fault zone\u2019s hanging wall, having an approximate NNW-SSE orientation. Conversely, the second set of striae lacks a visible sense of movement but generally trends N\u2013S to NE-SW. The NE-SW direction of the fault movement, as presented in Fig.\u00a02k, agrees with the direction of fault movement computed from the model results, which proves its reliability. To reconstruct the stress field that has affected Devonian carbonates, paleostress regimes from the generated stress tensors from the Steltenberg quarry (Fig.\u00a02d, e, g, h) were analysed using the stress ratio, \n\u03d5\n, and, following the stress index, R\u2019.\n34\n All over the study area, results consistently indicate both reverse and strike-slip faulting regimes. For the reverse faulting regime, the ENE-WSW thrust faults show sub-horizontal NNW-SSE oriented \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n (Fig.\u00a02g, h) and having an R\u2019 value of 2.5, which is associated with pure compression. In contrast, the NNW-SSE striking normal conjugate faults indicate a strike-slip regime with the R\u2019 of 1.5 and an approximately NW-SE sub-horizontal \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n (Fig.\u00a02d, e). From the kinematic analysis in places within the quarry, it was determined that more than one stress state has successively occurred due to varied principal stress axis directions. Although located around 12km away from the model area, results of the fault-slip analysis in the Steltenberg quarry agree with the simulated RSR values.\n\n\n6.4.2\nValidation against subsidence data\nThe distribution of subsidence in the Ruhr region\n38\n was used to validate numerical results based on visual comparison. By comparing the modelled RSR values at depths below the coal mining levels (i.e.,\u00a01.9km), a good correlation between subsidence and extensional areas (RSR\n\n<\n 1) was observed. This phenomenon confirms the correlation between stress regime and vertical motion of the rock mass. Plateaued regions correlate with more compressional areas (RSR\n\n>\n 1), which was observed in the southern parts of the model. Furthermore, major NW-SE striking faults confine the amount of subsidence\n38\n potentially proving their recent activity in the prevailing in situ stress state (Fig.\u00a03). It can be, thus, stated that the results of the numerical model are in agreement with the distribution of subsidence in the Ruhr region.\n\n\n6.4.3\nValidation against microseismic data\nMore than 5100 seismic events were recorded between 2014 and 2018 at the location of the former, but at that time active, Prosper-Haniel coal mine in the north-western part of the model\n50\n (Fig.\u00a03). The majority of seismic events were located at depths of active coal mining and are expected to be directly related to coal mining activities.\n51\n Around 140 seismic events with M\nL\n\n>\n 1.5, were located at depths greater than the maximum mining depth in the Prosper-Haniel mine between 2014 and 2018 with the deepest seismic event being located at approximately 9km (following the trace of the NW-SE striking H\u00fcnxer fault). These events, responding to the stress changes on the scale of an entire mine, could have been related to the tectonic response, resulting from coal mining, and possible reactivation of preexisting faults.\n103\n Such occurrences were observed in e.g.,\u00a0the Saar coal district\n104\n in SW Germany. Conclusions by\u00a0Ref.\u00a0105 based on a detailed study on the correlation between specific longwall mining faces and seismic events recorded between 2016 and 2018 within the Prosper-Haniel mine, also point in this direction. They proved that some of the analysed seismic events with M\nL\n\n>\n 2.5 were located at a distance of 2 to 5km from specific longwalls and have relatively uniform waveforms with a frequency in the range between 5 and 8Hz. Additionally, recomputed stress drops from these events were significantly higher than those assigned to the specific longwalls. These phenomena prove that the analysed events were a mixture of the ones related to the reactivation of preexisting faults (i.e.,\u00a0frictional earthquakes) and directly mining associated fractures.\n\nTo investigate, if seismic events below the active mining depths in the Prosper-Haniel mine were related to the fault reactivation, acquired seismic events with M\nL\n\n>\n 1.5 were projected onto the model volume. 15 seismic events with M\nL\n\n>\n 1.5 (with 3 events with M\nL between 2.7 and 2.9) were located either directly on or in close proximity to the major NW-striking H\u00fcnxer and Krudenburg faults. These events correlate with the fault segments with high T\ns and CFF values computed based on the numerical results from the 3D geomechanical model, indicating their high reactivation potential (Fig.\u00a08). Such observation could prove that the stress changes related to the mining operations induced movement on the major NW-SE striking fault zones in that area and resulted in induced seismicity. Taking into account the error connected to the seismic event location and simplification of model geometry, the match between sections with high reactivation potential and seismic events is more than satisfactory.\nTo look at the seismicity within the Prosper-Haniel coal mine in greater detail, registered seismic events at depths were compared to CFF and its x, y, and z derivatives from two major fault zones (i.e.,\u00a0NW-striking H\u00fcnxer and Krudenburg faults) confined within the coal mine. It was observed that the majority of seismic events were confined within the Upper Carboniferous layers. As discussed before, one could deem events recorded up to \n\u223c\n2.0km depth as being directly related to the rock excavation processes (i.e.,\u00a0rockfall) due to their proximity to the active coal mining depths. Events located \n>\n2.0km depth, could have been, instead, related to the significant stress change transfer caused by coal mining, which leads to the reactivation of preexisting faults. It is noticed that the stress release is much lower in the Devonian layer than in the Carboniferous layers, where the transition between these units, at the depth of \n\u223c\n4.2km, correlates with a significant CFF decrease. This could potentially indicate a transition between Carboniferous and Devonian rock mass and, simultaneously, prove the accuracy of the model geometry.\nBased on the observations above, it can be stated that the modelled in situ stress state in combination with assumed friction criteria is in agreement with the observed induced seismicity in the region and could potentially predict the boundary between Carboniferous and Devonian units. Even with the potentially high uncertainties of input and calibration data, and simplification of model geometry and rock mass properties, much beneficial information have been obtained. This should also suggest the high importance of further research directed towards the quantification of uncertainty sources, especially to the ones introduced by the variability of the model input parameters.\n\n\n6.4.4\nValidation against mining observations\nIt is widely assumed, that critically stressed fractures and faults are the main fluid pathways in the subsurface\u00a0(e.g., Refs.\u00a071\u201373). An indication of fault permeability in the Ruhr region arises from a study by\u00a0Ref.\u00a058 on the NW-SE striking Krudenburg fault located within the Prosper-Haniel mine (Fig.\u00a03). Two major water inflows with volumes between 0.3 and \n\n18\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n were observed during fault penetration between mine shaft number 9 and 10 causing major disruptions during mining operations. A successful attempt of sealing the highly permeable fault was made by removing \u00bf 75\u2008000m3 of water using 2.5km of relief boreholes and injecting 5500m3 of grout. Based on results from the numerical model for the Krudenburg fault, the mean T\nd and T\ns values amount to 0.80 and 0.33, respectively. Increased T\ns values are especially visible in southern and northern fault segments (Fig.\u00a08). This agrees with the field observations by\u00a0Ref.\u00a058. Surface methane emissions studies by\u00a0Ref.\u00a059 prove that the majority of the emitted gas at the surface, in the vicinity of the city of Bochum, was emitted alongside an NNW-SSE direction. Both studies confirm the high stress criticality of the NW-SE to NNW-SSE oriented discontinuities, the stress-dependent direction of permeability within the Ruhr region, and a good agreement with the results of the numerical model.\n\n\n\n6.5\nApplication for geothermal reservoirs\nAs an example, three different locations within the modelled area were analysed in terms of the best conditions for establishing a deep geothermal system in the Ruhr region (location in Fig.\u00a03). From the three preselected locations, location B is deemed to be the best suited for the establishment of a geothermal system. This is due to the potential for propagating horizontal and\/or subhorizontal fractures as a result of transpressive stress regime prevailing up to a depths of approximately 4.0km, which is favourable in terms of reservoir permeability (Fig.\u00a09). Additionally, Devonian layers, of improved hydraulic properties, are at a shallower depth in location B than in the two others. In the location A and C, the transpressive stress regime is limited to a depth of around 1.0km with a strike-slip regime below. The planned wellbore could be drilled towards the NE-SW direction for achieving higher productivity outputs. Once drilling in the NE-SW direction will be connected to the penetration of one of the major NW-SE or NNW-SSE striking fault zones, their reactivation could be considered as relatively likely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nIn this study, a 3D in situ stress state quantification in the Ruhr region using numerical modelling was presented. The developed 3D static geomechanical model was validated against a comprehensive calibration dataset including results from geophysical logging, borehole deformation and fault-slip analysis, in situ measurements, distribution of subsidence, seismicity, and observations from coal mining operations. Spatially continuous 3D in situ stress state, as presented in this study, instead of point-wise stress information, provide an effective tool for planning subsurface operations in areas where no stress information is available. The wide range of model uncertainties could be mitigated by (i) detailed GPS measurements for constraining the amount of horizontal motion of tectonic plates, (ii) laboratory measurements of rock mass properties under reservoir-specific conditions, (iii) 2D and 3D seismic surveys, (iv) deep exploratory drilling campaigns for improved constraints on the subsurface geometry, rock mass, and fault zone properties, and (v) in situ stress measurements at greater depths and, especially, in the southern parts of the Ruhr region. Nonetheless, as for the current state of knowledge and data availability, our approach provides the best estimate of the state of prevailing in situ stress tensor for applications in e.g.,\u00a0Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical simulations.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was carried out in the framework of the 3DRuhrMarie (\u201cFHprofUnt2016\u201d) project, which received funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and geomecon GmbH\n .\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nMichal Kruszewski: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Visualization.

The canister will be placed in vertical deposition holes with different depths depending on the length of the fuel elements with a diameter of 1.75\u00a0m bored from the floor of long deposition tunnels in crystalline rock. Cavities will be excavated at a depth of at least 500\u00a0m.(1; 3; 4) The geometry of the repository concept is shown in Fig.\u00a01.\n\n\nWhen an earthquake affects a fracture intersecting a deposition hole, the fracture may slide, inducing some shearing at the buffer and the contained canister.(7) As the buffer material is significantly softer than both the rock and the canister, during a rock shear through a deposition hole it plays an important contribution in mitigating the stress transmission. Since the shearing is very fast and the hydraulic conductivity of the bentonite is very low, it is not expected that the pore water in the water-saturated bentonite will be redistributed. As the compressibility of water and particles is low, the bentonite might be modeled as a solid material that does not change the volume but only exhibits shear deformations.(8) In this case, the simulation considers undrained conditions, and the parameters for carrying out are undrained parameters, where the Poisson\u2019s ratio is close to 0.5, bulk modulus approaching infinite and the effective stresses remain constant. However, the calculations in this paper use the fully hydro-mechanical (HM) coupled approach considering effective stress variations.\nIt is complex to evaluate the influence of rock shear deformations on the canister-clay system. In order to understand this response, a calculation can only be made using the finite element method or similar techniques. CODE_BRIGHT(9; 10; 11) is a Finite Element Method (FEM) program capable of performing coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) analysis in geological media. It has been developed at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) and works combined with the pre\/post-processor GiD, developed by the International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE, www.cimne.com).\nA mock-up test was performed during the 1980s(12) where a 30\u00a0mm shear displacement was imposed in a test set-up at 1:10 scale at different shear rates. On the other hand, weight and size restrictions for test facilities require that the mock-up is smaller than the actual canister but that major features are accounted for.(8; 13) A solid copper rod surrounded by MX-80 bentonite at a saturation density of \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nm\n\n\n=\n2050\n\n kg\/m3 was emplaced inside the test cell. The bentonite was saturated under constant water head conditions before the shearing.\nThe canister is designed to maintain the spent nuclear fuel isolated from the surrounding environment for at least 100,000 years.(7) The canister is composed of two main components; a load-bearing insert with channels made in cast iron for the spent fuel and an outer corrosion barrier made in copper. The canister in detail is displayed in Fig.\u00a02.\nThe material selected for the corrosion barrier is Cu-OFP (oxygen-free copper doped with 30\u2013100\u00a0ppm phosphorus,(7) that has excellent corrosion stability under the repository conditions and high ductility which will preserve its integrity under the loads that are expected in the repository. The copper shell shall keep its isolation and containment of the radioactive contents of the canister for a very long period. In all probability, the corrosion resistance and mechanical stability must be especially high.\nPure copper is a natural element that has shown in nature it can remain in comparable circumstances for millions of years.(14; 15; 16) The capacity of copper for deformation is also excellent as it occurs in the ductile regime and this is a reason for selecting it for the material of corrosion shield.(6)\nBodner and Partom(17; 18; 19) formulated a set of constitutive equations to represent Elastic-viscoplastic strain-hardening material behavior for large deformations and arbitrary loading histories. This model has been chosen for copper simulation here. An essential feature of the model is that the total deformation rate is considered to be separable into elastic and inelastic components, which are functions of state variables at all stages of loading and unloading.\nThe most important role of clay is to protect the canister from harmful effects by the groundwater, which is done by low hydraulic conductivity and low diffusivity of bentonite. It is also a swelling load-generation media and it is a supporting and flexible material.(20; 8; 21) Following this concept, the clay buffer preferably is made of highly compacted bentonite with a maximum density at saturation of 2022\u00a0kg\/m3(7) if the bentonite is MX-80.\nThe clay engineered barriers can be assessed in full-scale \u201cin situ\u201d tests(22; 23; 24; 25) or in scaled tests \u201cin situ\u201d tests.(26) The \u201cin situ\u201d tests can also be used for measuring certain phenomena or for measuring the evolution of part of the repository in host rock in a scaled test or full-scale tests.(27; 28) (Olivella and Alonso, 2008) The laboratory tests(29; 30; 31; 32; 33; 34; 35) are intended for measuring the properties of the material. In contrast, the mock-up tests(36; 12) are intended for observing relevant phenomena on a small scale or the repository scale controlled by realistic boundary conditions. The viscoplasticity model for unsaturated soil based on Desai and Perzyna theory has been chosen as constitutive models for clay.(37; 38)\nThe shear-mock-up tests have been modeled with the finite element code Abaqus by B\u00f6rgesson and Hernelind\n8\n for the full-scale scenarios in SR-Site successfully. The results were compared with the measurements.\nThe aim of this paper is to study the effect of shearing on the canister-clay system. For the validation, the results of the 3D shear tests modeling using CODE_BRIGHT have been compared with the mock-up tests performed by B\u00f6rgesson.(8; 12)\n\n\n2\nBodner\u2013Partom model\nThe constitutive model implemented in CODE_BRIGHT for the copper modeling was developed by Bodner and Partom(39; 18; 19) and it is described in more detail in Ref.\u00a017. The Bodner\u2013Partom constitutive equations, from the flow law (von Mises) of isotropic plasticity, can be written as: \n\n(2.1)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\nd\nt\n\n\n=\n\u03bb\ns\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u025b\n\n\np\n\n\n and \ns\n are the plastic strain tensor and the deviatoric stress tensor, respectively. Eq.\u00a0(2.1) can be written in terms of stress and strain invariants: \n\n\n(2.2)\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n2\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.3)\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n2\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n\n\nD\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nJ\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\nD\n\n\n2\n\n\nP\n\n\n is the second invariant of the deviatoric plastic strain rate tensor, and \n\n\nJ\n\n\n2\n\n\n is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor. After the combination of Eqs. (2.1) through (2.2), the plastic strain rate is expressed in the following form: \n\n(2.4)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\nd\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\nD\n\n\n0\n\n\nexp\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nJ\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n2\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nD\n\n\n0\n\n\n is the limiting strain rate and changes with the strain velocity.(18) Values of \n\n\nD\n\n\n0\n\n\n as a function of the plastic strain rate \n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n are presented in Table\u00a01.\n\n\n\n\n\nn is the strain rate sensitivity parameter and temperature-dependent constant. \n\n(2.5)\n\n\nn\n=\n\u2212\n0\n.\n025\nT\n+\n16\n.\n6\n\n\n\n\nZ is resistant to plastic flow and loading history dependency. \n\n\nZ\n\n\n0\n\n\n and \n\n\nZ\n\n\n1\n\n\n are the initial and saturated values of the internal state variable Z.

The inner dimensions of the mock-up test cell were the height of 622\u00a0mm and the diameter of 158\u00a0mm. The canister was simulated by a cylindrical rod of solid (high purity oxygen-free) copper (height of 450\u00a0mm and diameter of 80\u00a0mm). This rod was surrounded by highly compacted MX-80 bentonite with an initial water content of 9% and a density of 2140\u00a0kg\/m3, equivalent to a dry density of 1963\u00a0kg\/m3. The dimensions of the blocks were smaller than the inner dimensions of the sample in order to be able to assemble them into the test cell. The target density after the swelling process was 2050\u00a0kg\/m3, equivalent to a dry density of 1640\u00a0kg\/m3 assuming a density for the solid of 2780\u00a0kg\/m3. The water was supplied through a brass sintered filter with a maximum pore size of \n\n12\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n surrounding the bentonite keeping a slight overpressure to the bottom in order to have a flow of water upwards through the filter during the whole saturation process for warranting saturation conditions. The saturation process of bentonite did not depend on the filter due to its large hydraulic conductivity as compared to clay hydraulic conductivity. The filter was also stiff enough to resist the swelling pressure and the load due to the shearing. Distilled water was used.\nThe shear test apparatus (Fig.\u00a03) had the cylindrical housing divided into two similar parts by a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis. One of these parts was held fixed and the other could be displaced perpendicularly to the cylinder axis. The samples were placed in the cylindrical housing of the shear apparatus. Afterward, the samples were completely saturated with distilled water, thereby inducing a swelling pressure in the bentonite. Finally, the samples were sheared at various displacement rates.\nThree tests were carried out with different shear rates: Test 1, 2, and 3 with shear rates of 19\u00a0mm\/min (0.0317\u00a0mm\/s), 1.9\u00a0mm\/s, and 160\u00a0mm\/s.\n\n\n6\nModel development and validation\nThe scope is to validate models implemented in CODE_BRIGHT with the copper-clay shear test results. To do this, the results of the numerical model using CODE_BRIGHT in the coupled hydro-mechanical analysis were compared to the results of the copper-clay shear test with horizontal displacement rate simulating horizontal rock shearing through a deposition hole in the center of the canister. The model and the finite element mesh are presented in Fig.\u00a04. Note that all elements are continuous elements, without using contact elements. The elements in the shear zone are smaller.\nThe slow test (Test 1) was simulated. This test was utilized for carrying out the complete test modeling, performing the simulation of the three-month saturation process, and shearing process of around 15\u00a0min. The findings were relative to the calculated results by B\u00f6rgesson, \n12\n providing useful knowledge about the material models and modeling technique\u2019s relevance. The assumed initial effective stresses were null and the initial porosity for bentonite was 0.41, equivalent to a dry density of 1640\u00a0kg\/m3. The initial degree of saturation considered was 36%.\nThe saturation process period considered was 90 days (as in Ref.\u00a012) with a liquid pressure of 0.1 MPa on the boundary, equivalent to saturation conditions of the filter. Gas pressure was considered constant and equal to 0.1 MPa (atmospheric pressure). Modeling was performed by solving the momentum and water mass balance equations.\nFor bentonite and copper, an elastic-viscoplastic material model was used, with stress\u2013strain relationships obtained from laboratory experiments. Since the shear is fast, the density did not change too much during the experiments due to the low permeability. The predicted canister stresses and strains are used to evaluate plastic and creep deformation against copper shell failure criteria. The hydraulic parameters of MX-80 bentonite are listed in Table\u00a02.\nThe constitutive model for bentonite uses a linear elastic part and an inelastic part that is viscoplastic for saturated and unsaturated soil based on Desai and Perzyna theory(43; 41) (elliptical yield surface corresponding to modified Cam-Clay model) and the parameters\u2019 values are included in Table\u00a03.\nA linear elasticity model and Bodner\u2013Partom viscoplasticity(17; 19) for copper have been considered and Table\u00a04 refers to the parameters.\nAccording to Fig.\u00a05, Points A and B have been chosen for the analysis of the model. The mesh is composed of 3410 nodes and 2592 elements. The element chosen was linear quadrilateral prism with selective numerical integration (8 points) by means of the modification of matrix B.\n\n\nFig.\u00a06 depicts the change in suction as a function of mean effective stress. Changes in suction from a high value of 90 MPa, representing the initial conditions, where the degree of saturation was 36% at a dry density of 1640\u00a0kg\/m3, to null suction, representing fully saturated conditions. At mean effective stress of 10 MPa, the path achieves the LC (Loading-Collapse curve), and in the fully saturated situation and shearing phase, the mean effective stress is reduced.\nAs indicated above, before shearing, the bentonite was saturated with distilled water through the surrounding filters using low water pressure and allowed to soak for three months. The swelling pressure was continuously measured. For model validation, three months was thought to be sufficient time to achieve the steady-state conditions in swelling pressure according to results in Ref.\u00a012. The comparison between the swelling pressure calculated in numerical modeling by CODE_BRIGHT and measured in the experiment is shown in Fig.\u00a07. Despite the difficulty of the models and the complexities in calculating stresses and strains during the saturation phase, the findings indicate an agreement between modeled and tested results. Before one month, there is a tiny discrepancy in swelling pressure between the simulation and the experiment due to the value of the hydraulic conductivity, which seems to be overestimated in the model, but after that, the calculated swelling pressure is very close to the measured value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a08 depicts the stress path for locations A and B (Fig.\u00a06). The saturation phase occurs from the mean effective stress of zero to 10 MPa. Some deviatoric stresses develop in this phase but they vanish as full saturation is achieved, indicating that this process leads to a final state quite isotropic.\nThe shearing phase begins at mean effective stress of about 10 MPa. Under shearing conditions, the stress path reaches the critical state line (failure envelope), and the Cam-Clay ellipse follows the stress path during the shearing phase and illustrates the intersection point between the stress path and the failure envelope. The change in the size of the Cam-Clay ellipse is due to local deformation. The conditions in the model are not purely undrained because permeability is low but not zero.\nAccording to Fig.\u00a09, the radial stress in bentonite was measured in three spots on the surface of the copper canister and three points on the surface of the steel tube (rock). Two different set of properties of copper were considered for the simulated shear tests in CODE_BRIGHT at small strains conditions. The reference model uses the parameters from Bodner\u2013Partom, 1975 and the calibrated model (calibrated refers only to copper parameters), the properties of the copper obtained from the test presented in Ref.\u00a08. The sensitivity analysis of calculated (Reference model and calibrated model) and measured radial stresses in Test 1 are shown in Fig.\u00a010 and according to the calculations, the transducers 7 and 9 do not differ significantly and they roughly coincide with the corresponding measurements in Test 1.\nIt should be noted, as B\u00f6rgesson\n12\n stated, that these measurements are difficult to make since the bentonite is highly stiff and is not permitted to swell during the rapid shear and valve formations at the transducer\u2019s contact point are possible. So according to difficulties involved with this sort of measurement, it is remarkable that the agreement between measured and modeled stresses is so good.\nAs it is shown in Fig.\u00a09, the strain gauges were glued axially to the canister surface. The calculated and measured strain in the canister surface as a function of shear displacement is shown in Fig.\u00a011. According to the measurements and calculations, the only transducers that appear to operate properly are numbers 16,17, and 18.\nWhen graphing the strain in the copper bar surface vs. total shear displacement using strain gauges 16, 17, and 18, we can observe that the form and amplitude of the curves correspond extremely well between modeled and measured results.\nThe displacement of the simulated canister in relation to the simulated rock was measured in 4\u00a0cm from the canister\u2019s end. Fig.\u00a012 depicts a comparison between calculated and measured relative displacement for this test.\nDespite being 5\u00a0mm apart, the modeled and measured curves correspond quite well. The inclination and the form of the curve (straight line) are almost similar. The observed tilting (relative displacement) does not begin until after 5\u00a0mm shear displacement, but the modeling results show that the tilting begins immediately.\nThe geometries after the shear tests and the total forces with respect to displacements in numerical modeling are compared with experimental measurements. The shear test was made at room temperature.\nAfter the calculations, the results of CODE_BRIGHT (a finite element analysis) are related to experimental data.(8; 12) Comparison between the CODE_BRIGHT modeling and experiment regarding the geometry is shown at the end of the test in Fig.\u00a013.\nFinally, total forces in the canister-clay system concerning the displacements in the shear test are compared. The total forces calculated in the simulations are compared to the measurements obtained from the experiment for the shear test in Fig.\u00a014.\nThe shear tests can also be well simulated if the initial effective stress is considered to be 10 MPa, avoiding the saturation process simulation. The results are similar as the calculated stress distribution in bentonite produced during saturation is almost uniform. The outcomes of the shearing phase simulation with and without the simulation of the saturation phase are compared for Test 1 in Fig.\u00a015.\nThe parameters were calculated from a tensile test carried out in a copper sample.(8) The test (carried out at a strain rate of 0.0031 s\u22121) and the simulation of the test with the Bodner\u2013Partom model and Calibrated from the test with HPOF (high purity oxygen free) copper(8) are presented in Fig.\u00a016 and the parameters are referred to in Table\u00a04.\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nFor the validation of the constitutive models used in copper and bentonite, canister-clay shear test results B\u00f6rgesson\n12\n were compared with the results of the numerical model using CODE_BRIGHT computer code. The shear rate was relatively fast and therefore, due to the low hydraulic conductivity of bentonite, it was expected that the pore\u2019s pressure did not have time for dissipation.\nThe swelling pressure calculated in numerical modeling by CODE BRIGHT and measured in the experiment is compared, and despite the difficulty of the models and the complexities in calculating stresses and strains during the saturation process, the results indicate good agreement between the test measurements and the modeling results.\nRegarding the deviatoric stress-mean effective stress curves, during the saturation period, the distribution of stress is nearly uniform. Under shearing conditions, the stress path approaches the critical state line (failure envelope). The shearing phase stress path exhibited ductility and hardening characteristics for bentonite.\nAfter calculating the canister-clay system with shear rate, the total forces calculated in the numerical modeling are approximately the same as the total forces measured in the test. Implementation is correct as the results are reproduced with the same parameters. The buffer can be plastically deformed without extra stresses when the shear strength is achieved. The higher the shear strength of the buffer has the higher stresses in the canister.\nIn the end, a comparison of the shearing phase calculation with and without including the saturation phase revealed that the results are identical. The tensile test (at a strain rate of 0.0031 s-1) and the simulation of the test with the Bodner\u2013Partom model and calibration from the test with HPOF (high purity oxygen free) copper(8) were validated.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nPeiman Khadivipanah: Conceptualization, Visualization, Software, Writing, Data curation, Validation, Methodology, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 original draft.

Buried cables, nuclear waste, or underground thermal energy storage facilities can release heat into the surrounding soils. In saturated soils, conduction through solids or forced advection by groundwater in more permeable strata are usually the key heat transfer mechanisms. These processes are well understood and the application of convection\u2013diffusion equation can give a close match to field data (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a01\u20133).\nEarly work suggested that heat and mass transfer were only likely to be coupled when the water was moving as a liquid.\n4\n However, later research contradicts this. Radiation has been shown to be relevant in very coarse materials.\n5\n In fine soils (fine sand or smaller grain sizes) with a degree of saturation \n<\n60%, thermal movement of liquid moisture and diffusion of vapour are now believed to be of key importance for heat transfer.\n6\n This is consistent with the observation of Hutcheon\n7\n that a pressure gradient can be induced by net condensation and evaporation within the liquid phase, thus creating a liquid flow in opposition to the direction of vapour diffusion. These coupled processes are less studied in geotechnical engineering, although more commonly seen to be of importance in soil science.\n8\n\n\nThe classical theory for coupled diffusion of vapour and flow of liquid water in soils was set out by Philip & De Vries,\n9\n based on adaptions of Darcy\u2019s Law and Fick\u2019s Law. However, in some cases the theory does not give a good fit to experimental data (e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a010), resulting in the introduction of empirical adjustment factors. Limitations of the theory for applications in geotechnical engineering include the absence of (i) convection of the gas and liquid phases, (ii) evaporation and condensation, owing to the assumption of water-vapour equilibrium, (iii) hysteresis, and (iv) a deformable solid matrix.\n11\n\n,\n\n12\n The inclusion of non-equilibrium mass transfer is especially critical.\n13\n The importance of including this in analysis has been shown numerous times in different fields, including in materials engineering,\n14\n in soil science, e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a012, and for ground heat storage applications.\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n\n\nNonetheless, the complexity of fully coupling heat and mass transfer including liquid water and vapour flow means that relatively little work has been carried out on the subject within the geotechnical sphere.\n8\n There are also relatively few recent datasets available for testing theory, with notable recent exceptions including the laboratory scale physical models of Moradi et\u00a0al. \n15\n and Smits et\u00a0al. \n12\n. Experimental data at the micro scale can be particularly challenging to obtain.\nIn recent years, developments in X-ray CT scanning, a non-destructive method that allows imaging of the internal features of objects,\n17\n have allowed higher resolution images to be achieved in a shorter timeframe. This means that the experimental technique has expanded its application in geotechnical engineering to include quantification of transient processes in finer grained soils. For example, iterative-algorithm reconstruction approaches allow larger datasets to be reconstructed from fewer frames,\n18\n and synchrotron X-ray CT enables scans to be completed in seconds.\n19\n There is also an increasing use of CT scanners in real-time experiments to track movement of soil particles (e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a020), changes in moisture conditions,\n21\u201323\n and soil response to mechanical loading.\n24\n\n,\n\n25\n\n\nTaking advantage of these developments, this paper aims to (i) explore the potential for using X-ray CT techniques to observe and quantify the processes of liquid water movement in soils under thermal gradients; and (ii) make observations about the relative importance of liquid and vapour flows for soils of different grain sizes and degrees of saturation. These observations can then be used to draw conclusions about the processes that should be considered in applications in geotechnical engineering in different geological conditions.\n\n\n2\nExperimental method\n\n2.1\nOverall approach\nSoil heating experiments were carried out via X-ray micro-CT (\n\u03bc\nCT) scans (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a026, 27) in which small specimens were heated at their lower boundary and the consequent changes in water content and degree of saturation interpreted from the resulting scans. The experiments were carried out on two types of soils, a fine sand and a silty fine sand, at four different initial degrees of saturation. The following sections describe the materials used (Section\u00a02.2), the experimental CT setups (Section\u00a02.3) and the CT image reconstruction and segmentation processes (Section\u00a02.4).\nIt proved difficult to maintain a fully closed system within the soil during the experiments, and additional physical experiments (Section\u00a02.5) demonstrated that it was not possible to achieve conservation of mass within the scanned region. Consequently, the experimental results were also used to validate a numerical simulation. This numerical simulation (described in Section\u00a03) allowed fuller insights to be derived from the experimental results.\n\n\n2.2\nSoil materials and specimen preparation\nThe fine sand used was fraction E Leighton Buzzard sand\n28\n and the silty fine sand used was a mixture of 80% fraction E Leighton Buzzard sand and 20% HIQ5 silica flour. The particle size distributions of both materials are given in Fig.\u00a01. For each soil type, four different degrees of saturation were used in the experiments, with initial saturation of 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. These types of soils and saturation ranges were selected to facilitate investigation into the conditions in which heat transfer mechanisms other than diffusion dominate. The mechanism proposed\n6\n suggest that vapour diffusion could be important in fine sands and silty fine sands, but this domain has not been significantly investigated in previous research.\nCylindrical soil specimens with the dimension of 5\u00a0mm in diameter and 10\u00a0mm in height were prepared in special purpose specimen containers with acrylic side walls and an aluminium base to support one dimensional heat transfer. The small specimen sizes reflected the need for high spatial and temporal resolutions of the soil scanning due to the expected rapid heating.\nSpecimens were initially prepared in saturated conditions using wet pluviation.\n29\n The dry fine sand and silty fine sand were drained through a long and narrow funnel into the specimen container filled with de-aired water. The specimens were then dried in controlled conditions (20\u00a0\u00b0C and relative humidity of 50%) to achieve the pre-calculated gravimetric weight for every target degree of saturation. Repeatability of specimen preparation was checked in terms of soil porosity. For the fine sand this was 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% and for the silty fine sand it was 33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%. A double-layered Parafilm\n30\n seal was then applied to the top of the completed specimens.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\nExperimental setup\nExperimental work was carried out by X-ray \n\u03bc\nCT imaging using the Hutch 225\u00a0kVp\n31\n with a horizontally-mounted molybdenum reflection target. This ameliorates any potential influence from the heel effect artefact, which can be pronounced with vertically mounted reflection targets.\n32\n The soil specimen was mounted on the top of a Peltier heating unit from Deben, normal to the manipulator of the scanners. Temperature\u00a0(T) and relative humidity\u00a0(H), monitored using a hygrothermograph, were consistently at 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% respectively during scanning. No contrasting agent was needed thanks to the use of a molybdenum X-ray target.\nScan settings were chosen to achieve a high contrast between the different phases in the soil specimen, balancing the competing demands of a small-grain-size resolution, and to minimise scanning time. The major changes in water content in a soil specimen of this size occur within one hour. For each specimen, therefore, the experiment ran for nine scans, with each scan taking 7\u00a0min using the scan settings shown in Table\u00a01. This was the best achievable compromise between (high) image quality and (short) scan duration.\n\nAt the start of the experiment the temperature of the Peltier unit was set to 20\u00a0\u00b0C, consistent with the ambient temperature so that no thermal gradient was imposed prior to scanning. The first scan was used to capture these initial conditions. The temperature of the Peltier unit was maintained at 50\u00a0\u00b0C from the start of the second scan until completion of the experiment after the ninth and final scan. Temperature control was via a remote workstation, and the experiment and nine scans ran continuously.\n\n\n2.4\nImage reconstruction and segmentation\nRaw 2D projection data from image acquisition were reconstructed into 3D volume data using the cone-beam\n33\n filtered back-projection algorithm\n17\n implemented in Nikon\u2019s CT Pro v2.2 software.\n34\n This was chosen over algebraic reconstruction techniques\n35\n, following Liu et\u00a0al. \n36\n because use of Gaussian decomposition for segmentation of the data (see below), meant there was no need to suppress the noise from the undersampled data. From visual observation of the reconstructed image slices for the two types of soil specimens (see Fig.\u00a02), soil solid, liquid water and gas phases could be recognised. Examination of the point spread function\n37\n for the image data confirmed the image quality, returning values between 5 and 10.\nData pre-processing was implemented before quantitative segmentation into soil phases. A portion from the top and bottom regions of the reconstructed data was cropped to reduce the potential for errors caused by image artefacts.\n38\n 1500 image slices extracted from the entire 2000-slice image were retained for analysis, with the 250 slices nearest the top and base discarded. Additionally, a representative circular region of interest (ROI) in a horizontal plane was chosen from the middle of the specimen, to avoid the influence of the specimen boundary.\n\nGaussian decomposition was used for segmentation and post-processing, which was implemented on the raw 32-bit data.\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n This approach has benefits over established thresholding methods when the scan resolution dimension is not sufficiently small compared with the soil grain sizes, then the partial volume effect could be pronounced.\nThe density of a material is correlated to the greyscale in X-ray CT images, with the histogram of the grey value (GV) data from any scan usually following a Gaussian or normal distribution for each material present. In a single Gaussian formula there are three unknown variables: mean grey value (\n\u03bc\n), standard deviation (\n\u03c3\n) and voxel count (a). The general form of a single Gaussian function can therefore be written: \n\n(1)\n\n\nf\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n=\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n(\nx\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a three-phase soil material, the overall GV histogram is equal to the sum of the individual Gaussian functions for the individual materials present. Hence Gaussian decomposition can be used to back calculate the proportions of the three phases.\nGaussian decomposition was first applied to the global GV histogram from additional scans of a dry and a fully saturated fine sand specimen carried out under the conditions in Table\u00a01. This allowed calculation of the \n\u03bc\n coefficients for each material (\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ng\n\n\n for gas, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nw\n\n\n for liquid water and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n for solid), which are constant for each specimen. The voxel count of soil solid (\n\n\na\n\n\ns\n\n\n) was then determined from the initial scan data in each heating experiment by validating against the weight of the solid particles. \n\n\na\n\n\ns\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ng\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nw\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n were then used as fixed inputs to the Gaussian decomposition of the subsequent scans in each experiment. The standard deviation was assumed to be the same for all phases, as all scans were conducted under the same scan settings.\nThe input coefficients and variables are presented in Table\u00a02 for the fine sand and in Table\u00a03 for the silty fine sand. Different mean GVs were calculated for the specimen corresponding to each degree of saturation, according to the calibration process for result optimisation. This also considered the potential variations in each specimen, for example the existence of dense sand materials, and scan conditions (e.g.\u00a0subtle variations in GV from the X-ray source instability) along with the variance of water vapour in soils with different degrees of saturation which can be classified as either gas or liquid water according to their densities. The remaining coefficients in Tables\u00a02 and 3 can then be determined by fitting with the GV histograms.\n\n\nAn example of Gaussian decomposition is presented in Fig.\u00a03. The three phases have individual curves, which when summed give the total GV curve. The gas phase (with the lowest density) is at the left of the GV axis and the solid phase (with the highest density) at the right, with liquid water in middle. The area underneath each curve represents the voxel count corresponding to that phase portion.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5\nParafilm tests\nAdditional tests were conducted to investigate whether the Parafilm lid, which was applied to the top of each specimen for sealing purposes, really acted to prevent mass transfer from the top of the specimen and hence ensured a closed soil system. The experiments were prompted by observations of liquid water droplets on the underside of the Parafilm at the end of the heating experiments, which suggested that although the specimen-Parafilm system may have been sealed, water was able to leave the soil specimen itself. This would mean that there was no longer mass conservation within a soil specimen.\nAdditional soil specimens were prepared using the procedure outlined in Section\u00a02.2 above. These specimens were then weighed, sealed with Parafilm, and subjected to heating in the same way as described in Section\u00a02.3, using a 50\u00a0\u00b0C basal temperature. However, these tests were not carried out inside the scanner. In this case, the specimens were heated for one hour as described in Section\u00a02.3, the Parafilm lid was removed and the specimens immediately re-weighed to determine the mass of water that was now outside the soil specimen, having re-condensed on the Parafilm lid.\n\n\n\n3\nNumerical model\nA numerical simulation was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics,\n40\n based on the non-equilibrium approach.\n12\n\n,\n\n15\n\n,\n\n41\n The approach includes liquid\/gas phase change and has been validated against physical experiments of evaporation,\n12\n and heat transfer around ground heat exchangers.\n15\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a04 illustrates the key physical processes included in the model, which is based on the principles of mass conservation for the flow of liquid and gas (air and water vapour) and energy conservation for heat transfer.

The initial temperature of the soil specimen was set to the ambient temperature in the Hutch scanner, 20\u00a0\u00b0C (293.15\u00a0K). To represent the start of heating, the temperature at the base was set to increase linearly to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (308.15\u00a0K) over the time of the first scan, after which it was held constant. Testing of the Peltier unit has shown this to be a good representation of the physical experiments. The initial mass fraction of vapour in the gas phase (\n\n\nw\n\n\nv\n\n\n) was set to 0.03, following a sensitivity analysis. \n\n\nP\n\n\ng\n\n\n was assumed to be atmospheric pressure (1\u00a0atm) and \n\n\nP\n\n\nw\n\n\n was determined from the van Genuchten model.\n43\n\n,\n\n44\n\n\n\nThe model boundary conditions are summarised in Table\u00a07. The thermal boundary conditions at the outer side and the top of the soil specimen were set to convective. For the acrylic wall at the outer side a heat transfer coefficient of 20\u00a0W\/m2 was used. For the top surface a value of 10\u00a0W\/m2 was applied, corresponding to natural convection.\n61\n Sensitivity analyses showed that these values do not have a significant impact of the key simulation outputs. Mass transfer was not permitted from the base or the outer edge of the specimen. However, based on observations of liquid water on the base of the Parafilm at the end of the physical experiments, an outflow boundary was assumed for liquid, gas and vapour at the upper surface. Calibration of this boundary is described in Section\u00a03.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nKey assumptions\nThe model contains some important general assumptions. Adjacent phases were assumed to have the same local temperature (\n\n\n\nT\n\n\ng\na\ns\n\n\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\nw\na\nt\ne\nr\n\n\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\no\ni\nl\n\n\n=\n\n\nT), although it will vary spatially and temporally in the model. The soil structure was also assumed to be undeformable, so that the porosity of the specimen remained constant with no volume change occurring. Most soil parameters were assumed to be constant and independent of temperature, including the residual water content, viscosity of gas, density and volume of the soil matrix along, and the thermal conductivity for each phase. The \n\n\n\nP\n\n\nc\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n relationship described by the van Genuchten model was also assumed to be temperature invariant.\nTemperature dependent parameters are given in Table\u00a06. The temperature dependency of the density and viscosity of liquid water means that buoyancy-driven natural-convection flow was included in the simulation. While the interfacial drag between the fluid phases was neglected, the much more significant drag between the fluid phases and the solid matrix was included in Darcy\u2019s law.\n\n\n3.4\nMesh sensitivity\nThe mesh was formed of triangular elements. A mesh sensitivity study was carried out for the fine sand with an initial degree of saturation of 30%, using total element numbers between approximately 100 and 6500. For all cases within that range, the final degree of saturation at the end of heating was 21.7% compared with 21.1% in the physical experiment. However, cases with fewer than approximately 1000 elements gave inconsistent internal patterns of specimen moisture content, suggesting the element size was too large compared with the scale of the processes taking place within the specimen. After further investigation, a model with 1784 elements (Fig.\u00a05) was chosen to provide more consistent patterns of liquid water distribution, with no further change in distribution occurring with the use of smaller elements.\n38\n\n\n\n\n3.5\nModel calibration and validation\nThe outflow boundary at the top of the numerical model required calibration. This was because the precise amount of water leaving the soil specimen at the top of the sample, and any change in rate of flux with time, could not easily be quantified from the X-ray CT experiments. However, the Parafilm tests described in Section\u00a02.5 indicated that a mass of water in the order of 10\u22124 to 10\u22123 grams left each soil specimen over the one-hour heating period. This corresponds to an average rate of evaporation (m3\/s per\u00a0m2 specimen area, i.e.\u00a0m\/s) of \n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n8\n\n\n\u2013\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n7\n\n\n\nm\/s\n\n at the soil surface, consistent with the order of magnitude of observed steady state soil surface evaporation rates.\n62\n\n\nTo investigate the nature of the outflow conditions, a constant total flux of \n\n\nU\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n, within the range \n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n8\n\n\n\n\u2013\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n7\n\n\n\nm\/s\n\n, was specified as a starting point. Different relative outflows of liquid water, gas and vapour were then trialled based on the five cases given in Table\u00a08. Case\u00a01 considered the same rate (in m\/s) for all three phases, Case\u00a02 had no liquid flux, Case\u00a03 had only liquid flux and Cases\u00a04 and\u00a05 had lesser and greater proportions of liquid flow respectively. For each case, the value of \n\n\nU\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n at each scan time in the physical experiment was adjusted manually to achieve the best fit between the simulation results and the global saturation values in the experiments for the four specimens of fine sand. The best match was obtained for Case\u00a02 with no liquid water outflow. Fig.\u00a06 shows the calibrated outflows in terms of \n\n\nU\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n and Fig.\u00a07 shows the match between the simulation and the experimental data. The values of \n\n\nU\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n vary up to a maximum of 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m\/s and are therefore consistent with both the results of the Parafilm tests and previous work of soil surface evaporation. Although not shown in the figures, the distribution and changes in distribution of local moisture content were also checked for comparability between the simulation and the experimental data to confirm the plausibility of calibration process.\n38\n\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a06 shows that \n\n\nU\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n tended to increase and reaches its maximum value at an early stage when heating was first applied (time \n>\n 0\u00a0min) and then decreased over time. The specimens of the lower saturation showed a higher initial rate of outflow, which then reduced rapidly. By contrast, the specimens of the higher initial saturation also displayed an initial increasing outflow but became stable at a relatively lower rate that sustained for a longer period. In all cases, equilibrium with no further outflow was reached by the end of the experiments. While Case\u00a02 provided the best fit, it should be noted that this same pattern was observed whilst fitting for all the cases (given in Table\u00a08). Nonetheless, the adoption of Case\u00a02 implies that the role of gas and vapour flow at the top of the sample was much more important than that of liquid water flow, and that these processes occurred much more rapidly upon heating in lower saturation specimens. This topic will be reviewed in the following section, where the experimental results are discussed in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nExperimental results\n\n4.1.1\nCharacteristics of specimens\nBoth the fine sand and the silty fine sand show a non-uniform distribution of initial moisture over the height as shown in Fig.\u00a08. Typically the GV, which indicates the density of a material, is lower at the top of the specimen. This represents either a higher porosity or a lower water saturation; the latter is more likely, given the drying of specimens used to obtain the target initial saturation values.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2\nVariation in saturation with time\n\nFig.\u00a09 shows how all the eight specimens dried overall with time. (Note that the scale is very different from that used in Fig.\u00a07 and the origin in Fig.\u00a09 is true; but that the experimental data for the fine sand data are the same). For the fine sand specimens, the change in the overall degree of saturation due to heating was approximately 10% regardless of the initial value, although the changes occurred more rapidly when the initial saturation was lower. For the silty fine sand, the overall change in saturation due to heating was less, at about 5%, and it was harder to discern a difference in behaviour depending on initial saturation values.\nThe local distribution of moisture in the specimens and its change over time in response to heating is investigated with reference to isochrones for the degree of saturation with depth (Fig.\u00a010). Each data point corresponding to a certain height at each isochrone (under each scan) was determined from the Gaussian decomposition analysis on the corresponding subsection image data (comprising 300 image slices per subsection), and the middle position of the subsection was taken as its vertical location within the sample height.\nConsistent with the specimen overall saturation data (Fig.\u00a09), the coarser specimens and those with a lower initial saturation dry more rapidly and to a greater degree. In all cases, drying is greatest at the base of the specimen closest to the heat source. Here progressive drying is seen with each time step. However, in the upper part of some specimens, particularly the fine sand at lower degrees of saturation, the degree of saturation may increase again later in the test. This is manifest in the crossing of the saturation vs. depth isochrones for different times. This may be a result of the direct movement of liquid water within the specimen, but as discussed in later sections is more likely to be due to re-condensation of water vapour that had previously evaporated in the lower part of the specimen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3\nLoss of mass\nThe degree of saturation data from the X-ray CT scans suggests that the fine sand specimens lost approximately 10% saturation and the silty fine sand specimens lost approximately 5% saturation due to heating, regardless of the initial degree of saturation. This can be compared with the changes in saturation calculated based on the mass loss measured during the Parafilm sealing experiments described in Section\u00a02.5. Fig.\u00a011 shows that in these experiments, the change in degree of saturation depends on both the grain size and the initial saturation. For an initial degree of saturation of 50%, the Parafilm test specimens exhibit a change in saturation within a few percent of that in the X-ray CT experiments. However, for the specimens with an initial saturation degree of 20%, the Parafilm tests show a much more reduced degree of drying than the X-ray CT experiments.\n\nBoth the X-ray CT results and the Parafilm tests data show water leaving the soil specimen but to differing degrees. To understand this difference, we need to remember that the X-ray CT data are only for the ROI in the centre of the specimen, whereas the Parafilm tests cover the entire specimen. The ROI from the X-ray CT data is a cylindrical volume that crops about 1\u00a0mm from the top and base of the specimen and approximately 0.5\u00a0mm for the sides. The part of the specimen outside the ROI forms a three-dimensional annulus. The ROI and the annulus represent 51% and 49% of the total specimen volume, respectively. Assuming that the specimen is uniform in terms of initial water distribution (since the spatial variability within the annulus is not known), we can use the experimental results to determine a water mass balance for the ROI and the annulus.\n\nFig.\u00a012 shows the results of the water balance calculation. Initially, prior to heating, 51% of the water in the specimen was within the ROI and 49% within the annulus. After heating, up to 14% of the water mass had left the specimen completely. Based on the mass of liquid water measured on the Parafilm, it is known that up to 6% of this had vaporised and re-condensed. The remaining up to 8% must have escaped as vapour. The amount of water within the ROI decreased, to between 27% and 40% for the fine sand (Fig.\u00a012a), and to between 39% and 45% for the silty fine sand (Fig.\u00a012b). The amount of water in the annulus outside the ROI either increased or decreased depending on the initial degree of saturation. If the initial degree of saturation was high, the water in the annulus reduced. If the initial degree of saturation was low, the amount of water in the annulus increased; these increases corresponded to the cases where the reduction in moisture in the ROI was greatest. This suggests that redistribution of moisture occurred from the ROI to the annulus for specimens possessing a lower initial saturation, and especially for the fine sand (Fig.\u00a012a).\nKnowing the specimen porosities of 40% (for the fine sand) and 33% (for the silty fine sand), it is possible to calculate the available void space in the annulus and determine whether it is possible for it to have received this additional water. In all cases the answer is yes. However, the specimens are heated from the base, and given the evidence from Fig.\u00a010 for the greater drying at the base as well as increases in the degree of saturation near the top of the ROI in some cases, this suggests that water is likely to have moved, in particular from the ROI to the upper part of the annulus. If all the transferred liquid water had moved to the upper half of the annulus, the final degree of saturation here would be between 40% and 90%, with the higher values pertaining to cases with a higher initial saturation.\n\nThese calculations assume that the specimen is uniform, which it is known not to be. Owing to the nature of specimen preparation, specimens tended to have a greater saturation near the base initially and also may have a higher porosity near the edge. The first may mean that the extent of moisture movement is underestimated, while the second may mean there is more void space at the edge of the specimen to accommodate the moisture movement; consequently the final saturation values for the upper part of the annulus given above could be overestimated. The other place to accommodate moisture would be in any ullage or \u201cheadspace\u201d between the top of the specimen and the Parafilm cap. While this should theoretically be zero, very little space would be needed to accommodate the volumes of water involved (\n<\n1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m3).\n\n\n\n4.2\nNumerical results\nExamination of the numerical results allows additional inferences to be made about heat and mass transfer in the different soil phases which cannot be observed directly from the X-ray CT results.\n\n4.2.1\nThermally driven vapour flow\nConsistent with other studies in different scenarios, e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a063, the results of the numerical analysis conducted for the fine sand case shown that the dominant flow mechanism in the specimens is vapour flow. Fig.\u00a013 illustrates this with arrow plots of liquid and vapour flow directions for the initial saturations of 20% and 50% at 7\u00a0min into the heating experiments, close to when the flow would be expected to be the most significant. The flow domain is presented within the full specimen height (z) versus half symmetrical geometry (radius, r), and the colour of the arrows indicates the magnitude of the flow occurring at this time. In Fig.\u00a013 (and for all other analyses), water flow is seen to be small and in a downward direction due to gravity, while vapour flow is much more important and in an upward direction. This is because of the effect of the imposed temperature change, which induces a vapour density difference that drives flow. These results are consistent with the work of Hutcheon,\n7\n which showed that the direction of liquid flow is opposite to that of vapour flow, and that the liquid pressure gradient induced by heat is less significant than that of gravity. This effect is greater closer to the heat source, so that the gravity driven liquid water flow is reduced in the lower parts of the specimens (Fig.\u00a013). Liquid flow is also less significant in the less saturated specimen, reflecting the reduced water permeability associated with low saturation levels.\n\nSimilarly, the fact that moisture is rapidly moving away from the heat source by vapour diffusion is at least a partially reflection of the high relative vapour permeability. Fig.\u00a014 shows the estimated variations in the relative gas and liquid permeabilities (as Krg and Krw, respectively) over time for two initial degrees of saturation (20% and 50%). The higher initial saturation specimen shows a higher initial liquid permeability with some reduction due to drying. These cases also show a corresponding large increase in vapour permeability along the experiment progress.\nIn both cases Fig.\u00a014 shows vapour diffusion to be dominant. However, the highest relative gas permeability occurs in the lower saturation specimen. This is consistent with these specimens experiencing the quickest changes in saturation (Fig.\u00a07).\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2\nVapour density\n\nFig.\u00a015 shows the changes in vapour density with time, along with the changes in degree of saturation from the numerical model for the fine sand specimens with the initial saturation of 20% and 50%, respectively. While the change in degree of saturation depends on the initial saturation, being faster for the least saturated specimen, the change in vapour density is rapid in both cases. All the change in vapour density happens within the first 7\u00a0min. This is due to the rapid change in specimen temperature, for example the specimen with the saturation of 20% as shown in Fig.\u00a016. Beyond 7\u00a0min, there is negligible further change in temperature occurs.\n\n\nThe fact that the degree of saturation continues to change after 7\u00a0min, however, suggests that the vapour must be leaving the system (and in reality re-condensing on the Parafilm) and being replaced by a further water evaporation from the specimen, which results in the continued drying of the specimen. This effect is especially important for specimens with a higher initial saturation. It is also consistent with the Parafilm test results, which show that a greater proportion of the moisture leaves the soil and accumulates on the Parafilm in the case of specimens having a higher initial degree of saturation.\n\n\n4.2.3\nRe-distribution of liquid water\nAs well as confirming the dominance of vapour diffusion as the means of heat and mass transfer within the specimens, the numerical simulation also allows a greater understanding of the potential for thermal redistribution of moisture due to re-condensation of vapour. Fig.\u00a010 shows that in the experiments on the fine sand with the lowest initial degree of saturation there appeared to be some increase in moisture content in the upper part of the specimen later in the test. This tendency is confirmed by the numerical results as shown in Fig.\u00a017. For the first 14\u00a0min the sample is seen to dry significantly. After this time, further drying is seen near the base but in the upper third of the specimen the change in saturation reverses slightly, before drying is observed again throughout the specimen in the later stage of the experiment. This confirms the suggestion that the water that is not escaped as vapour, re-condensed on the Parafilm lid, or retained within the ROI of the X-ray CT image, could be present as liquid water in the top of the specimen (refer also to Fig.\u00a012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nExperimental approach\nOne of the aims for this paper was to explore the usefulness of the X-ray \n\u03bc\nCT scanning techniques in energy geotechnics problems in which water may be redistributed in unsaturated fine sands or smaller-grain-size soils. While the results presented do show the ability to observe these processes in fine sands and silty fine sands, there are some limitations. First, the experimental results were dominated by vaporisation and vapour movement. While this cannot be observed directly by X-ray CT techniques, the later re-condensation of moisture can be detected. However, this was only seen in some scenarios during the experiments, owing in part to the challenge of maintaining a closed system. It also reflects the need to crop the X-ray CT data to avoid errors or the influence from image artefacts. These points could be addressed in future work, but require permanent sealing of the specimen, or testing under confined conditions which would add to the complexity of the experimental arrangements.\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for applications in energy geotechnics\nThe results indicate that there is potential for significant rapid vaporisation and vapour flow due to thermal gradients, particularly in soils with a low initial degree of saturation. Resultant drying will increase the soil shearing resistance. Also, there is potential for changes in soil thermal properties which are of importance in problems such as ground heat storage and heat dissipation from buried cables.\nThe results presented in Section\u00a04 suggest changes in soil saturation of only 5% to 10% is expected to occur, even with heating up to 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Consideration of the changes in thermal conductivity with the degree of soil saturation measured by other researchers (Fig.\u00a018) shows that the relative significance of the changes in thermal properties depends on the type of soil. Clayed soils will experience rapid changes in thermal conductivity due to small changes in moisture content at degrees of saturation over 40%. On the other hand, silts and sands can experience rapid changes in thermal conductivity at degrees of saturation less than 10%. This suggests that the type of soil materials tested in this study could see a reduction in thermal conductivity by 50% as a result of heating, which would be significant for problems in energy geotechnics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis paper has presented the results of heating experiments on soil specimens conducted via X-ray \n\u03bc\nCT scans and numerical analyses, to investigate the processes of heat and mass transfer problems occurring in unsaturated fine soils. The results indicate that:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nCoarser soil (fine sand) dries more rapidly and to a greater extent than finer soil (silty fine sand). This is due to the relatively larger surface area and the smaller pore size of the finer soil which would take longer to dry at the same saturation under the same other conditions.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe specimens with the lowest initial saturation experienced the most rapid drying process. This may be due to the fact that vapour diffusion is the dominant flow pattern and a higher relative gas permeability was possessed by the specimen with a lower saturation.\n\n\n\u2022\nVaporisation and movement of vapour are the main mechanisms of mass transfer in soil specimens with the grain sizes and degrees of saturation investigated (fine sand and silty fine sand).\n\n\n\u2022\nEspecially at the lower moisture contents, the lower liquid water permeability and higher vapour permeability are likely to be key factors governing the thermal behaviour of soil specimens.\n\n\n\u2022\nRe-distribution of liquid moisture due to evaporation and re-condensation was found to play a lesser role in the cases investigated. However, there was clear evidence for this process occurring in the fine sand, especially at the lowest degrees of saturation. The soil specimens in the tests were not fully sealed, which may or may not be representative of field conditions.\n\n\n\u2022\nOverall, the changes of moisture content that occurred within the specimens were relatively small. Nonetheless, this could result in thermal conductivity reductions of up to 50% for silts and sands with low initial saturations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nKui Liu: Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Data curation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Visualization.

Since heating and cooling of buildings accounts for up to 40% of energy use and 20% of emissions,\n5\n this area must be prioritised for change. Carbon intensity of the UK electricity grid roughly halved since 2014.\n6\n It is widely anticipated that electrification of heating and cooling using ground source heat pumps (GSHP) will be an important part of the solution (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a07, 8). However, current barriers to heat pump use include their high capital costs and insufficient capability in the market for drilling the large quantity of ground heat exchangers that will be required to be coupled to the GSHP systems. For new construction, both these challenges can be addressed by achieving dual use of piled foundations as both structural support and ground heat exchangers (GHEs). So called \u201cthermal piles\u201d or \u201cenergy piles\u201d have the pipes for the primary thermal fluid circuit for the GSHP system embedded within the pile concrete. This saves on capital costs (e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a09), as well as the energy embodied in construction, and inevitably places the ground-source heat exchanger close to the building where it is needed.\nVarious arrangements of heat transfer pipes are engineered in practice, typically relating to the underlying construction method of the pile.\n10\n Where large diameter rotary bored piles are used, the heat transfer pipes are usually located on the pile steel reinforcement cage, which tends to be 50\u00a0mm or 75\u00a0mm from the edge of the pile. Concrete is then poured into the pile with the cage and pipes in situ. However, where piles are constructed using a Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) method, the fluid pipes tend to be located towards the centre of the pile, arranged around a steel reinforcement bar for stability. This is because the steel cage, which rarely needs to extend the full depth of the pile, is placed after the concrete. Therefore, to obtain full depth pipe installations, it is practical to plunge the pipes into the concrete with an additional full depth steel bar. Both these arrangements are summarised in Fig.\u00a01 (parts\u00a0a and\u00a0b). Additional arrangements, such as the use of the spiral coil heat exchanger are also sometimes used with piles (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a011, 12). However, in the UK, rotary and CFA types dominate. In all cases, these construction differences give rise to different thermal response characteristics.\nThermal piles potentially offer higher heat transfer rates per drilled metre than conventional borehole heat exchangers\u00a0\n13\n due to the ability to include more pipes\u00a0\n14\n in the larger cross section of the ground heat exchanger. They have also been shown to offer good system energy efficiencies overall.\n15\n However, the larger pile cross sectional area also means that the transient heat transport within the pile may cause pile heat exchangers to perform significantly differently to boreholes.\n16\n Consequently, analytical methods used for the design of boreholes coupled to GSHP systems are rarely applicable when thermal piles are used (e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a017). However, relatively few pile-specific design approaches have been developed. This is in part due to the challenge of dealing with the many potential different pipe and pile geometries that will affect the short term transient thermal behaviour. Prediction methods that include explicitly for the specific geometry of an individual pile tend to be complex in form (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a011, 18, 19) and hence potentially computationally expensive or hard to access for practitioners. Meanwhile methods which offer simplifications (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a016, 20) and hence are easier to use, may have lesser accuracy.\n\nAs a consequence, there is still a need to develop computationally fast models of thermal piles that remove the need to consider the full pile and pipe geometry explicitly, but yet retain sufficient accuracy over a representative range of timescales. In this paper we make use of an elegant semi-analytical solution for conductive heat flow, which exploits radial symmetry. Here we call this model, the Claesson\u2013Javed Radial model (CJRM). It is detailed in\u00a0Ref.\u00a023 and in\u00a0Ref.\u00a022, where the model is tested for typical borehole heat exchanger geometries (e.g.\u00a0Fig.\u00a01c). In\u00a0Ref.\u00a024, Woodman et\u00a0al. first examined the potential of using CJRM for thermal piles. A central thermal store was added to the original radial arrangement, with the intention of accounting for the large mass of concrete that can be present at the centre of a thermal pile. However, the effect of the store was to lower the mid-time temperature, which tended to worsen the match to what occurs with a real geometry.\nTherefore, in this paper we examine direct implementation of the original CJRM for piles, focusing on obtaining input parameters that optimise its performance, and quantifying the differences that occur between this approximate approach, numerical simulation of an explicit pile and pipe geometry, and real data. In Section\u00a02 of the paper we detail the CJRM model, and two and three dimensional explicit geometry models. Section\u00a03 presents the results of model comparisons under both constant and varying thermal load conditions, as well as application of CJRM to thermal response test data from a real case study. Finally, we draw conclusions about the cases in which CJRM will be appropriate for application to thermal piles.\n\n\n2\nMethod\n\n2.1\nApproach\nWe test the CJRM against a number of conditions of differing complexity, utilising both numerically-generated synthetic datasets for explicit pile and pipe geometries, and also field data.\nFirstly, to remove additional complications from axial effects, comparison is made against synthetic data in the 2D plane. This permits examination of model errors arising only from the geometry simplification of the CJRM, without these being masked by any effects that might result from heat flow in the third dimension. At this stage, we examine a thermal step response (often described as a \u2018G-Function\u2019, the relationship between constant applied thermal power and resulting temperature change) for a full range of pile geometries and conductivities.\nSecondly, by comparing against synthetic data in 3D we include for axial effects due to the temperature gradient in the heat-exchanger pipes and vertical conduction in the ground and in the GHE. This provides a fuller assessment of the suitability of the model to more realistic conditions, yet still retains assumptions such as homogeneous and isotropic ground conditions. Greater computation expense in three dimensions means only select geometries are considered.\nNext, CJRM is compared against time-varying thermal loads applied in three dimensions to investigate the model performance under typical operational conditions. Finally, having built an understanding of both the radial and axial effects under different loading conditions, we apply the model to a field thermal response test (TRT) data set, complete with the variability that comes from fluctuations in power supply and ground heterogeneity than can give spatial variations in thermal properties.\n\n\n2.2\nThe Claesson\u2013Javed Radial Model (CJRM)\nThe two-dimensional CJRM is set out in detail in\u00a0Ref.\u00a023. A summary is provided in the following paragraphs with implementation equations given in the Appendix. The key assumption made is that the fluid in the multiple heat transfer pipes in the GHE (see Fig.\u00a01a, b, c) are amalgamated to a single fluid-filled pipe. This means that the GHE geometry is simplified to a cylinder, as shown in Fig.\u00a01d, with unchanged external diameter of \n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n and an internal diameter of \n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n. The fluid sits within the cylinder and is represented by a homogeneous isothermal unit (of radius \n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n, refer also to Section\u00a02.6.1) located at the centroid of the ground heat exchanger (Fig.\u00a01d). The fluid is assumed to be uniformly heated by power per unit depth, \n\n\nq\n\n\ni\nn\nj\n\n\n\u00a0(W\/m). The pipe that surrounds the fluid is given no explicit thickness in the model, but is still attributed a thermal resistance acting at \n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n.\nOutside of the pipe there is an annulus of GHE material (i.e.\u00a0concrete or grout). At the ground heat exchanger wall (at \n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n), the thermal medium changes from the GHE material to the surrounding ground.\nThe temperature above an initially uniform temperature, due to unsteady radial conductive heat flow in the CJRM is described as: \n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\na\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\n2\n\n\nT\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nt\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nr\n\n\n,\na\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\nc\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n<\nr\n<\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\ng\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n<\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere the thermal diffusivity, \n\na\n=\n\u03bb\n\/\n\n\n\u03c1\nc\n\n\n\n, in general changes at the ground heat exchanger wall due to differences in both the thermal conductivity (\n\u03bb\n) and specific heat capacities (\n\n\u03c1\nc\n\n) of the GHE material and the surrounding ground.\nThe radial heat flux in the ground heat exchanger and ground is given by Fourier\u2019s law in radial co-ordinates: \n\n(2)\n\n\nq\n=\n\u2212\n2\n\u03c0\nr\n\u03bb\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nr\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\u03bb\n depends on the material i.e.\u00a0for \n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n<\nr\n\n, \n\n\u03bb\n=\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n and for \n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n>\nr\n>\n\n\nr\n\n\np\n\n\n\n, \n\n\u03bb\n=\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n where the subscripts g and c refer to the ground and the GHE filling material respectively.\nThe heat-flux is continuous over the GHE\u2013soil interface and thus, \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nr\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nr\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quasi steady-state heat-flow through the pipe is given by: \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u2212\nT\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\no\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nR\n\n\np\n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere the thermal resistance of the single equivalent pipe is calculated by: \n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\nln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\n\n\n\u2212\nd\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \nd\n is the thickness and \n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n is the number of pipes in the real geometry.

The resulting equations used to practically implement the CJRM for that step response are given in the Appendix.\nWhere required, a time-variable power input is simulated by considering the input power signal to be made-up of a series of piece-wise constant heat injections over time steps of duration \n\n\u0394\nt\n\n.

This is to ensure that any differences in model performance determined by the analysis are truly related to the model errors and not to time stepping factors.\n\n\n2.3\nNumerical simulation\n\n2.3.1\n2D numerical explicit models (EGM2D)\nA finite element model of the pile with a realistic arrangement of pipes is made in 2D (denoted explicit geometry model, \u2018EGM2D\u2019). Conduction is simulated in a horizontal plane that passes through the pile. By definition, any effects of the ground surface or pile base are excluded. The fluid within the pipes is assumed to be an isothermal unit with uniformly distributed heating. Unsteady-state heat flow is assumed through the pipes, which are placed within the pile at typical construction locations. The unsteady heat equation is cast in Eulerian co-ordinates, i.e.\u00a0\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u2207\n\n\n2\n\n\nT\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\na\n=\n\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n in the concrete or grout, \n\na\n=\n\n\na\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n in the ground and \n\na\n=\n\n\na\n\n\np\n\n\n\n in the pipe wall.\nThe EGM2D model shares some of the major assumptions that are also made for the CJRM: heat flow is by conduction only (groundwater advection is neglected), homogeneity (and stationarity) of thermal properties, isotropy. The steel reinforcement bar is ignored.\n26\n The external lateral boundaries are constant temperature (equal to the initial temperature, 0\u00a0\u00b0C) and are located sufficiently far away (the model diameter is 25\u00a0m) to not influence the heatflow in the simulations. This approach is consistent with previous validated analyses, e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a016, 21.\nThis system is solved using COMSOL 5.3a (via Heat Transfer in Solid module). Different pile sizes and pipe arrangements were analysed (see Section\u00a02.4). Mesh sensitivity and time-stepping checks were carried out to confirm the appropriateness of the spatial and temporal discretisation. Time-stepping was carried out using an implicit method (backward differentiation formula), with each step adjusted automatically to ensure numerical stability. The final mesh comprised between 40,000 and 45,000 elements depending on the specific geometry with a minimum element size of 0.5\u00a0mm. This is consistent with previously validated 2D pile models.\n16\n\n,\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2\n3D numerical explicit models (EGM3D)\nA more realistic explicit geometry model is made in 3D (denoted \u2018EGM3D\u2019). The ground surface is assumed to be non-conducting (i.e.\u00a0acting as a perfect insulator). While classic borehole heat exchanger models (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a027, 28) and some pile models (e.g.,\u00a0Refs.\u00a016, 20) use a constant temperature ground surface, this is less appropriate when piles are located beneath a building.\n29\n In such cases, an insulated boundary is a conservative choice for design compared with the classic approach, since the prediction of the heat exchanger\u2019s performance is on the pessimistic side. While there is some field evidence of limited heat transfer from buildings to the underlying ground,\n30\u201332\n there is not yet sufficient information to apply more specific criteria. Therefore, an insulated condition is considered a simple and reasonable assumption for the base of a building, and is consistent with recent work (e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a019).\nThe base of the model (at depth, \n\n\n\nD\n\n\na\n\n\n=\n40\n\n\u00a0m) is also assumed to be insulating. The pile has length \n\n\n\nD\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n20\n\n\u00a0m, so that the overall model vertical dimension is twice the depth of the pile and the lower boundary does not influence the thermal behaviour. The lateral boundaries are constant temperature (set to T=0, the initial condition) and located 25\u00a0m from the pile, again having no influence on the simulation outputs. The geometry and key boundary conditions are summarised in Fig.\u00a02.\n\nIn this case only two pile and pipe geometries are considered (see Section\u00a02.4), given the additional computational cost of three dimensions. The pile contains four pipes which are two \u201cu-loops\u201d connected in series. In reality they are connected via header pipes to a heat-pump at the surface. In the simulation this equipment is not included, and the fluid temperature in the pipes is determined according to the heat input q. Frictional heating along the pipe is neglected. Thus, longitudinal heat transfer along the fluid in the pipe is given by the 1D ordinary differential equation: \n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nf\n\n\nA\n\n\nC\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nd\nt\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nf\n\n\nA\n\n\nC\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nd\nl\n\n\n=\nA\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nl\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+\nq\n+\n\n\nq\n\n\np\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \nl\n is axial distance along the pipe and \n\n\nv\n\n\nf\n\n\n is the fluid velocity along the pipe. The pipe is a quasi-1D object set into a 3D conducting solid. The source term \nq\n is heating (this occurs only along the heat-exchanger at the surface) and the source term \n\n\nq\n\n\np\n\n\n is the heat transfer through the pipe wall from the pile (only occurring within the pile). Heat transfer through the pipe wall is quasi steady-state, with the pipe resistance being given by Eq.\u00a0(5). It should be noted that longitudinal heat transfer within the pipe material is neglected. Again, fluid convection resistance is also neglected, for simplicity, so \n\n(10)\n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u2212\nT\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\nR\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\no\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\np\n\n\n\/\nln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nHeat flow in the solid (ground and pile) is as per Eq.\u00a0(8) for the EGM2D, which has the addition of a \n\n\nq\n\n\np\n\n\n sink term which couples the heat transferred between the pipe and the pile. These equations are solved using COMSOL 5.3a (via the \u2018Heat Transfer\u2019 and \u2018Pipe Flow\u2019 modules). Mesh sensitivity and time-stepping checks were carried out to confirm the appropriateness of the spatial and temporal discretisation. Time-stepping was carried out using an implicit method (backward differentiation formula), with each step adjusted automatically to ensure numerical stability. For the CFA and rotary geometries, the selected meshes used approximately 260,000 and 225,000 elements, with minimum element sizes of 0.15\u00a0m and 0.2\u00a0m respectively. These configurations were chosen to balance model accuracy with computational and memory requirements. Following short term (24\u00a0h) testing at 50\u00a0kW constant power these models gave average pipe temperatures less than 0.06\u00a0\u00b0C and 0.21\u00a0\u00b0C below that calculated using finer meshes. However, at the required longer (\n\u2265\n 1 year) timescales (see 2.4 below), these finer meshes were too computationally demanding to be manageable, both in terms of run time and memory, even using high performance computing facilities. The consequences of this small temperature underestimation will be discussed in Section\u00a04.\n\n\n\n2.4\nSpecific geometries and material properties\nThere are three main types of numerically derived synthetic data and one case study of field data that are used here for examining the performance of CJRM. These four analyses are summarised as follows:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\nEGM2D vs CJRM is evaluated by simulated constant thermal load tests using the idealised parameters, given in Table\u00a01, for a range of pile geometries and material properties. Both CFA pipe arrangements and rotary bored pile pipe arrangements were tested. In the former case, either two or four pipes (\n\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n2\n\n, 4) were assumed to be installed around a 40\u00a0mm diameter steel bar. The bar itself was not included in the model, since this would not significantly affect the results.\n26\n Their arrangement was taken to be symmetrical, although previous work suggests their precise positions will have little bearing on the outcome.\n26\n For rotary bored piles, up to ten pipes were considered (\n\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n2\n\n, 4, 6, 8, 10). They were set at different offsets from the pile edge depending on the pile size. For large diameter piles (radius \n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n3\n\n m, 0.6\u00a0m) then a concrete cover to the pipes and steel of 75\u00a0mm was used based on structural recommendations.\n33\n For smaller diameter piles (\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n0\n\n.15\u00a0m), a reduced concrete cover of 50\u00a0mm was used as is common in practice to avoid congestion of the steel cage. Additionally, a borehole GHE of \n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n0\n\n.075\u00a0m was tested for comparison. This is a typical borehole size and therefore the pipes were positioned either in the centre and touching or at the edge (and touching the edge) of the GHE. These correspond to the extreme positions of\u00a0Ref.\u00a034. Different thermal properties were applied in the concrete and the ground so that their conductivity ratios were either 0.5, 1 or 2. The comparison is run over 107 s (115 days) to ensure reaching steady state conditions within the pile.\n\n\n(b)\n\nEGM3D vs CJRM is evaluated by comparison with simulated constant thermal load tests using the idealised parameters, given in Table\u00a01 for two 600\u00a0mm diameter piles of 20\u00a0m depth. One rotary arrangement and one CFA arrangement were used, with four pipes in each case. The concrete to ground thermal conductivity ratio was kept constant at 2. The comparison is run over 108 seconds (1157 days).\n\n\n(c)\n\nEGM3D vs CJRM is evaluated with a simulated variable thermal load using the idealised parameters, given in Table\u00a01 for two 600\u00a0mm diameter piles of 20\u00a0m depth (the thermal load is detailed in Section\u00a02.5). One rotary arrangement and one CFA arrangement were used, with four pipes in each case (Fig.\u00a02). The concrete to ground thermal conductivity ratio was kept constant at 2. The comparison is run over 3.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n\n\n\nx7\n\n\n s (1 year).\n\n\n(d)\n\nCJRM vs real data is evaluated for a field thermal response test (TRT) on a 600\u00a0mm diameter pile constructed to 31\u00a0m depth in London Clay, as reported by\u00a0Ref.\u00a019. As for the synthetic cases, the pile contained four pipes. The test lasted 1.27\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n\n\n\nx6\n\n\n s (353\u00a0h, or 14.7\u00a0days). Summary details of the test are given in Table\u00a02.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5\nThermal loads\nFor cases (a), (b) and (d) (Section\u00a02.4) constant heating power were applied to the numerical models and to CJRM as indicated in Tables\u00a01 and 2. For the case of varying thermal load application\u00a0(c), a hypothetical annual heating and cooling cycle is simulated by both an EGM3D and the CJRM. This is composed of daily heating cycles in the winter and daily cooling cycles in the summer. To determine the hour by hour thermal load, an annual sinusoid is multiplied by a daily heating or cooling shape to give an annual pattern (Fig.\u00a03). The heating and cooling shapes simply give the relative amount of heating and cooling in winter and summer respectively, and the total magnitude at any day is determined when they act as multiplier to the sinusoid. As is typical for many commercial buildings the annual heating and cooling energy is balanced. However, the cooling requirement occurs over a shorter time period in each day and at a higher rate. This is reflected in the heating and cooling shapes. The total energy demand applied to the single pile under simulation is therefore 41826\u00a0kWh in heating and a further 41826\u00a0kWh cooling with peak cooling at 60\u00a0W\/m and peak heating at 30\u00a0W\/m (Fig.\u00a03c). These power rates are within typical expected values for energy piles.\n13\n\n,\n\n35\n\n,\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n2.6\nEquivalence and matching\nTo apply the CJRM to a particular pile, an equivalent single pipe or radius \n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n needs to be derived. This was done via matching the 2D steady state resistance of the concrete pile in the numerical and analytical calculations for the long term using the results of the analysis in\u00a0(a) and\u00a0(b) (refer to Section\u00a02.4 above). Additionally, CJRM has been matched to very short time conditions of the numerical model through equivalence of the thermal capacity of the fluid. The results in Section\u00a03 show the magnitude of the deviation of the analytical and numerical models in the critical mid-time period that will be important for energy piles (a few hours to a few days).\n\n2.6.1\nGeometry and \n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n determination\nAll aspects of geometry and physics that can be preserved are retained in the CJRM. This includes the GHE material and ground thermal properties and borehole radius (\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n), which are kept the same as for the EGM. The effective radius of the single effective pipe (\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n) is set to provide the identical fluid temperature drop over the concrete pile during quasi steady-state conduction at the end of the constant thermal load simulation (i.e.\u00a0at t=1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u00a0s). This is achieved by computing the averages of \n\n\nT\n\n\np\no\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nb\n\n\n around the pile and pipe boundaries and assuming steady-state radial heat-flow at the end of the simulation, i.e.: \n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\np\no\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\nq\n\n\nR\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n\n\nq\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\nln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn this study we have determined \n\n\nR\n\n\nc\n\n\n from the EGM (using the left and side of Eq.\u00a0(11)). This is to remove \n\n\nR\n\n\nc\n\n\n estimation from our analysis and focus only on the comparative shape of the resulting step response curves (G-functions). However, in practice, the resistance of the concrete part of the pile, \n\n\nR\n\n\nc\n\n\n, can be determined by the multipole method.\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n A line source approximation to the multipole method is presented in\u00a0Ref.\u00a040 and has been shown to be sufficiently accurate for many geometry configurations, including piles with \n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\u2265\n 300\u00a0mm and \n\n\nr\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\u2264\n 40\u00a0mm, and also smaller energy piles, within certain \n\n\nr\n\n\np\n\n\n and \n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n ranges. In this case, \n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n would need to be determined from Eq.\u00a0(11) having independently assessed \n\n\nR\n\n\nc\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.2\nFluid thermal capacity and pipe resistance\nThe thermal capacity of the fluid, \n\n\nC\n\n\nf\n\n\n, is made equal to the fluid capacity in the EGM. This is despite the fact that the fluid area changes between the models. Therefore, in effect either the fluid density or specific heat \n\n\nc\n\n\nf\n\n\n are being changed. The thermal capacity per metre depth is \n\n\n\nC\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ni\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n.\nA characteristic time for thermal diffusion within the pipe wall is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\no\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\/\n\n\na\n\n\np\n\n\n\n, which is relatively short (\n\u223c\n30\u00a0s). Therefore, it is reasonable that the CJRM model assumes steady-state heat transfer in the pipe. Thus, the pipe resistance expected in the EGM is estimated as: \n\n(12)\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\nln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equivalent pipe resistance for the CJRM is a fraction of that for the EGM since there is only one pipe in the CJRM transmitting the same total power, i.e.\u00a0\n\n\n\nR\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\nR\n\n\np\n\n\n\/\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nCJRM performance in 2D\n\nTable\u00a03 shows the combination of pile sizes, pipe number and positions. Not all the permutations are evaluated, because there are limits under which it is physically possible to fit pipes around a central fixture, and also to reflect common practice. For example, CFA piles typically contain only one or two U-loops only (\n\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n2\n\n, 4), while for rotary piles the circumferential spacing (CS) of the pipes is rarely below 200\u00a0mm. For each of these combinations, Fig.\u00a04 gives the maximum absolute difference (error) in estimated fluid temperatures between the CJRM and EGM2D for 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u00a0s of constant heating under conditions given in Table\u00a01. For each combination three ratios of thermal conductivities in the borehole and ground respectively (\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n) are used. These are annotated as (1\u20132); (2\u20131); (2\u20132), giving conductivity ratios (\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n\/\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n) of 0.5, 2 and 1 respectively.\n\nIt can be seen that the errors are consistently larger in the case of pipes in rotary pile arrangements (Fig.\u00a04a) compared with the CFA arrangements (Fig.\u00a04b); up to 4 times larger temperature difference. This is to be expected given the greater similarity of the CFA geometry to the CJRM simplified geometry (Fig.\u00a01b and Fig.\u00a01d). For the rotary case the errors increase with the size of the pile and reduce with the number of pipes installed. This is because larger rotary piles with fewer pipes installed are clearly further from the idealised radial geometry shown in Fig.\u00a01d.\nFor both types of piles, larger errors are associated with a lower concrete to ground thermal conductivity ratio (0.5), while for the higher ratios (1 and 2) the errors are similar. This suggests that the absolute value of GHE material (concrete) conductivity may be more important. This makes sense since lower conductivities will lead to larger temperature changes and hence higher absolute errors.\nThe absolute values of temperature difference between the two models shown in Fig.\u00a04 will depend on the value of the applied thermal power. This was set at 50\u00a0W\/m to be in the centre of the range of recommended values,\n13\n\n,\n\n37\n and also higher than many field measurements.\n35\n For these reasonable conditions, the absolute error remains less than 1\u00a0\u00b0C for all the CFA pile geometries and many of the rotary pile geometries where the circumferential spacing is within typical ranges.\n\n\nFigs.\u00a05 and 6 plot the dimensionless temperature response of the different cases calculated using the CJRM and EGM2D models. In this case dimensionless temperature (\n\u03a6\n) is defined as: \n\n(13)\n\n\n\u03a6\n=\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\/\nq\n,\n\n\n\nand dimensionless time (Fourier number, \n\nF\no\n\n) as: \n\n(14)\n\n\nF\no\n=\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ng\n\n\nt\n\/\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n2\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1\nBorehole geometries\n\nFig.\u00a04 showed that the CJRM is comparatively accurate for typical borehole GHE geometries (i.e. in the case where the borehole radius is small compared to typical pile cross-sections). In Fig.\u00a05, it can be seen that these maximum differences are relatively small compared to the temperature changes over the period, and they occur in the period between Fo=0.01 and\u00a01. This is to be expected given previous results,\n22\n which showed maximum errors of 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C when validating the method against a large scale sandbox experiment. In our analysis, the greatest difference in predicted fluid temperatures is 0.18\u00a0\u00b0C (\n\n\u03a6\n=\n0\n.\n023\n\n), and occurs where there is a wider pipe spacing and when borehole and ground conductivities of 1 and 2\u00a0W\/mK are assumed. The CJRM approximation is therefore likely to be of adequate accuracy for many applications with boreholes of these dimensions. In the subsequent sections, we quantify the increasing errors with large diameter piles, and examine the times scales for these errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2\nImpact of pile size\n\nFig.\u00a06 shows how the accuracy of the CJRM changes for simulating increasing radius for piles installed with four pipes. It can been seen that as the pile radius increases, the shapes of the temperature response curves for the two models change. This is the source of the increased errors shown in Fig.\u00a04. In particular, at intermediate timescales (Fo\n\n=\n 0.01 to Fo\n\n=\n 1), as the diameter of rotary piles increases the deviation of the two models grows. The worst case is for pile and ground conductivities of 1 and 2\u00a0W\/mK respectively, which for a 1200\u00a0mm diameter rotary pile with four pipes results in a maximum error of 2\u00a0\u00b0C (\n\n\u03a6\n=\n0\n.\n51\n\n) at a time of just under 3\u00a0h (Fo\n\n=\n 0.035). This represents an error of 41% compared with the EGM2D temperature at that time. For the rotary cases the CJRM always underestimates the temperature change at the point of maximum error.\nFor CFA piles, the maximum mid time error occurs for the smaller diameter pile (300\u00a0mm), also for pile and ground conductivities of 1 and 2\u00a0W\/mK. The maximum error is 0.93\u00a0\u00b0C (\n\n\u03a6\n=\n0\n.\n23\n\n), occurring at just over 1\u00a0h (Fo=0.013). In these cases CJRM tends of overestimate the temperature change compared with the EGM.\nAt short and long times the temperatures predicted by both models converge. This is because the matching process (Section\u00a02.5) ensures long- and short-time\u200b asymptotic convergence of the step responses. The long-term (i.e.\u00a0for Fourier number, \n\nF\no\n>\n5\n\n) fluid temperature approaches a straight line on a semi-logarithmic temperature\u2013time graph, i.e.\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u223c\n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\ni\nn\nj\n\n\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nln\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\na\n\n\ng\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n0\n.\n5772\n\n\n+\n\n\nq\n\n\ni\nn\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\np\n\n\n+\n\n\nR\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n. This is the long term asymptotic behaviour of the classical infinite line source model (e.g. Refs.\u00a027, 41).

This is not the case for rotary piles, where the number of pipes strongly effect the appropriateness of the single pipe approximation in CJRM. Fig.\u00a07 shows the temperature response curves for four cases of 1200\u00a0mm diameter rotary piles with differing numbers of pipes from \n\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n4\n\n to \n\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n10\n\n. This illustrates how the mid time deviation reduces as the number of pipes increases, and also occurs at earlier times.\n\nGenerally the maximum error occurs between 1\u00a0h and 3\u00a0h (\n\nF\no\n=\n0\n.\n01\n\n to 0.05). It can be up to 2\u00a0\u00b0C for \n\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n4\n\n (pile and ground conductivities of 1 and 2\u00a0W\/mK respectively), but reduces to less than 1\u00a0\u00b0C once more pipes are installed so that the circumferential pipe spacing is less than 550\u00a0mm. In terms of \n\u03a6\n, the errors are up to 0.5 for \n\n\n\nN\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n4\n\n and between 0.1 and 0.25 for other cases.\n\n\n\n3.2\nCJRM performance in 3D\n\n3.2.1\nConstant thermal load\nThe 2D analysis above neglects axial heat flow.

Furthermore, the temperature gradient in the pipes (which will depend, amongst other controls, upon the fluid velocity in the pipes) will also cause the temperature distribution in the pile to deviate from the 2D idealisation. These effects can be seen in Fig.\u00a08, where substantial deviation between the two models occurs once \n\nF\no\n\n >100. At \n\nF\no\n=\n10\n\n the difference is less than 1\u00a0%, while at \n\nF\no\n=\n100\n\n, the difference remains less than 2%.\nThe precise time of divergence between the models will depend on the aspect ratio (ground heat exchanger length to diameter ratio), AR. In this case we present AR=33 (Fig.\u00a08). This is fairly typical for piles, but values can be as low as 15 or greater than 50.\n42\n As in the two dimensional analysis, the CFA piles show lesser difference between the EGM and the CJRM at smaller times (\n\nF\no\n\n <0.5). However, in the long term the difference will depend only on the aspect ratio and not on the pile internal geometry. At the end of the analysis (just over 3\u00a0years, \n\nF\no\n=\n763\n\n), the difference between the CJRM and EGM3D is \n\n\u03a6\n=\n0\n.\n2\n\n in both cases, representing 4\u00a0% and 5\u00a0% of the EGM3D total for the CFA and rotary cases respectively. Larger differences would be expected for less advantageous conductivity ratios, but at these timescales the differences are still small compared with the mid time deviations (Section\u00a03.1).\n\nDivergence is also expected to increase over longer timescales, with most energy pile design conducted over design lives of several decades. However, this analysis is limited to identifying the time of initial divergence. Here it is interesting to note that the differences between the two dimensional CJRM and the EGM3D are smaller and occur at later times than for the 2D and 3D pile temperature response analysis of\u00a0Ref.\u00a016. This is because we have used a more appropriate insulated surface boundary condition for our three dimensional analysis to reflect the position of most pile heat exchangers beneath a building. Whereas the resulting G-functions in\u00a0Ref.\u00a016 assume a constant surface temperature boundary more relevant for ground heat exchangers exposed to the ambient air temperature. The same constant temperature boundary condition is also used in other analytical models for piles e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a020.\nIn timescales longer than the three years considered in Fig.\u00a08, semi-infinite GHE with an insulated upper boundary condition will eventually reach steady state at a time dependent on the pile AR, as shown in\u00a0Ref.\u00a019. However, as shall be seen in Section\u00a03.2.2, a key factor for model errors in practice is the model differences at timescales corresponding to those when the thermal load changes. Hence, these very long timescale divergences are expected to be less important to practical model performance compared with daily and seasonal load fluctuations.\n\n\n3.2.2\nVariable thermal load\nThe temperature response of the two models under the conditions described in Fig.\u00a03 are shown in Fig.\u00a09 for both the rotary and CFA pile geometries. The specific cases are detailed in Table\u00a01.\nIn all cases the absolute model differences in Fig.\u00a09 are less than 1\u00a0\u00b0C, and for the majority of the year, less than 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C. For the rotary case (Fig.\u00a09a to d) the maximum absolute difference between EGM3D and CJRM is 0.8\u00a0\u00b0C and occurs in cooling. For the CFA case (Fig.\u00a09e to h) the corresponding maximum absolute difference is 0.7\u00a0\u00b0C, also in cooling. This is because the maximum cooling demand occurs at a higher peak power than the heating demand and temperature changes (and hence model differences) are proportional to applied heating power. For heating, the maximum absolute differences are 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C and for both rotary and CFA, reflecting lower peak heating power. In both these cases the same approximate magnitude of absolute difference is seen in the initial heating period and the final heating period. This is important as it shows no compounding of error with time over the year.\nThe maximum difference between the two models can also be considered in relative terms. Comparing the maximum absolute difference to the maximum absolute temperature changes in EGM3D gives 7\u00a0% to 16\u00a0% in the rotary case and 4\u00a0% to 8\u00a0% in the CFA case. In both cases the percentage errors start larger and reduce throughout the simulation. They are also proportional to the magnitude of the thermal demand, hence also being smaller in value for the majority of the year.\nIt is also worth noting that the patterns of temperature change predicted by CJRM and EGM3D are not the same for the CFA and the rotary cases due to the differing shapes of their respective G-functions. For the CFA case, the EGM3D, CJRM and difference curves all parallel each other (Fig.\u00a09f, g, h). In heating the decrease in temperature is always under predicted by the CJRM compared with the EGM3D, while in cooling, the increase in temperature is also under predicted by CJRM.\nFor the rotary case, CJRM also initially under predicts the change in temperature due to imposition of each heating or cooling phase (Fig.\u00a09b, c, & d). However, because the CJRM curve lags the EGM3D curve, this causes the curves to cross over. Hence as the heating or cooling demand reduces in each phase, so the CJRM comes to over predict the temperature reduction in heating and also over predict the temperature increase in cooling. This lag and crossing over is caused by the larger difference between the CJRM and EGM3D G-functions for the rotary case at around 1 to 2\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a010), the timescale over which heating and cooling demand drops off rapidly (Fig.\u00a03). In contrast, for the CFA case, the difference between the two G-functions is almost zero at this time, only increasing at larger time values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nComparison of CJRM with real TRT data\nA thermal response test in the London Clay for a \n\n\n\nr\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n300\n\nmm\n\n thermal pile has been reported in\u00a0Ref.\u00a019. The test lasted 353\u00a0h (14.7\u00a0days) and the pile was 31\u00a0m deep. Based on the temperature of the exchange fluid which was circulated prior to the test, the initial temperature in the pile and ground is estimated at 14.2\u00a0\u00b0C. The pile has 4\u00a0pipes within it, separated by shank spacing of 42.5\u00a0cm. The applied thermal power was 1.69\u00a0kW. Full details of the test and material parameters are given in Table\u00a02.\nTo fit these data only \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n needs to be varied, since \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ng\n\n\n is uniquely defined by the late-time gradient of the TRT and has already been fitted by\u00a0Ref.\u00a019, who found a value of 1.48\u00a0W\/mK using a \u2018resistive-capacitive\u2019 model. Rather than vary diffusivities directly, we fix the thermal capacities to match those estimated by\u00a0Ref.\u00a019 (i.e.\u00a0\n\n\n\nC\n\n\ng\n\n\n=\n2\n.\n4\n\n\u00a0MK\/Km\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n and \n\n\n\nC\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n2\n.\n2\n\n\u00a0MK\/Km3).\nBy this approach, a good fit was achieved for the EGM3D for \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n88\n\n\u00a0W\/mK (with \n\n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n=\n0\n\n.138\u00a0m and therefore \n\n\n\nR\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n0\n\n.14\u00a0mk\/W), with all the other parameters fixed (Fig.\u00a0A.1). This compares to 0.94\u00a0W\/mK estimated by\u00a0Ref.\u00a021. The shape of the thermal response curve also matches well with the experimental data.\nWhilst correctly matching the asymptotes, the CJRM fit underestimates the field data for \n\nF\no\n\n <0.3 or \nt\n <10\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a011). This mid time underestimate is consistent with the analysis shown in Fig.\u00a06 and Fig.\u00a07 for rotary piles. It would theoretically be possible to improve the fit by adjusting \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nc\n\n\n, whilst keeping constant the best-fit \n\n\n\nR\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n0\n\n.14\u00a0mk\/W. However, this route has not been pursued to maintain the physical basis of the approach, and avoid entrainment of errors related to the inherent uncertainties of real case data where the actual ground and concrete properties are not known with absolute precision.\n\nAlso shown on Fig.\u00a011 are some traditional and pile ground heat exchanger models. The linear simplification and exponential integral form of the infinite line source model (ILS,\u00a0Refs.\u00a041, 43) plot beneath and above the early to mid-time data respectively. The pile G-functions\u00a0\n16\n underestimate the temperature response for under 11\u00a0h, but overestimate the response at smaller times. The simulated temperature response curve is also markedly curved with an unrealistic upturn at the smallest time of its validity. This unrealistic shape has its origin in the semi-empirical relationship derived from curve fitting and perhaps suggests the need for adjustment to its validity times. The numerical models EGM2D and EGM3D are also shown in Fig.\u00a011. The fit is good but includes discrepancies arising from the use of a constant power assumption in all the analysis, despite the fact that real power levels are subject to small fluctuations. These simulations also come with greater computational expense compared to the other models shown.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThis paper presents the application of a radially symmetric heat conduction model to energy piles with the aim of providing a fast run time, yet theoretically robust analytical approach for design of pile ground heat exchangers. The suitability of the model should be determined against a number of criteria: accuracy for different pile geometries in the short term, long term performance, and ease\/speed of use.\nAnalysis of a wide range of geometries under constant thermal load suggests that the CJRM model will perform best for CFA piles. A good performance is also seen for rotary piles with four or more pipes installed, providing the pipe spacing is not too great. However, for small numbers of pipes, especially in larger piles, the equivalent radius approximation becomes less valid. For comparisons in two dimensions, for typical applied power values, a circumferential pipe spacing of less than 550\u00a0mm will keep the absolute error below 1\u00a0\u00b0C. This error may appear large, but it is reasonable when put in the context of expected ground loop temperature variations (\n\u00b1\n10\u00a0\u00b0C to 15\u00a0\u00b0C). Cases of larger diameter CFA piles, or rotary piles with many pipes will all have smaller associated errors, especially with favourable thermal conductivity values. All the greatest errors occurred where the pile concrete was less conductive that the ground. In the reverse scenario errors were often approximately half the magnitude.\nThe three dimensional comparison between models having a time-variable thermal load, at similar levels to those that may occur in practice, also showed reasonable agreement between CJRM and numerical simulations. Maximum difference between the two models were up to 0.8\u00a0\u00b0C and are associated with the times of peak power demand and also the greatest rate of change in power demand. Due to the computational demands of the EGM3D simulations, numerical errors mean that these differences may be underestimated slightly. Scaling the spatial discretisation errors described in Section\u00a02.3.2 for the average thermal power applied in the heating and cooling phases of the analysis, suggests that CJRM errors could reach 0.9\u00a0\u00b0C in the worst case (rotary case with maximum power application). Nonetheless, for the majority of the year long simulation CJRM errors remained below 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C. Actual values in practice would depend on the pattern of applied thermal demand.\nErrors appear largely consistent over a 1 year timescale under varying load conditions. While these short to medium term errors may be non-conservative, in the longer term any model differences will be conservative. At three years under constant thermal demand, only 5% model difference was observed, but with CJRM overestimating temperature changes compared with numerical simulation. In the longer term these two factors may cancel each other out. Additionally, these longer timescales do not correspond to critical changes in demand (hourly, daily, seasonal). Hence they may be less influential on overall model performance than smaller timescale model differences. The smaller impact of axial effects in the long term compared with previous studies also suggests that the assumption of an insulated surface boundary condition is a key difference between the operational conditions of energy piles and boreholes, making piles more suitable to two dimensional or quasi two-dimensional analysis than longer aspect ratio boreholes.\nWhen compared with other energy pile design models the CJRM approach performs well. It gives a more appropriate temperature response than the line source equations. Due to its physical basis it also gives an improved temperature response curve compared with the empirical pile G-functions. While CJRM is more complicated to use than these latter simpler solutions, it can still be readily coded in Matlab or similar software (refer to Appendix for full equations for doing this), and also maintains fast run times. In this analysis, small time steps (0.01\u00a0h) were used for application of CJRM to avoid any temporal discretisation errors compared with the numerical simulations, but these may not be required in practice. By comparison with resistive capacitive models, CJRM is also a lot easier to use and based in a real physical geometry with no \u201cblack box\u201d aspects.\n44\n By comparison with the fit of\u00a0Ref.\u00a019, the resistive capacitive model required 10 geometric based parameters, whereas the CJRM requires only determination of \n\n\nr\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n based on the pile resistance.\nFinally, the use of CJRM may be compared with the application of numerical simulation which is increasingly available to even smaller companies. The process of validating CJRM in this study has again shown the computational challenge of running three dimensional numerical simulation with hourly varying loads over many years as would be required for design cases. Even with the use of high performance computing facilities, long term fully three dimensional analysis is challenging to complete and demonstrates the need for simple, robust and fast engineering solutions like CJRM.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe Claesson\u2013Javed Radial Model (CJRM), originally developed for simulating borehole ground heat exchangers, has been tested for the case of energy piles, which have much larger diameters and thus smaller aspect ratios than typical boreholes. The step response of a thermal pile is dominated by the fluid thermal capacity at early time and by the ground resistance at late-time, transitioning between these, via a period dominated by ground heat exchanger resistance at mid-time. CJRM has been tested over all three of these time periods and the following conclusions are drawn:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe CJRM can be matched asymptotically at early and late times. The deviation from simulations using an explicit geometry therefore occurs at \u2018mid-time\u2019. The maximum deviation typically occurs between 1\u00a0h and 3\u00a0h and is less than 1\u00a0\u00b0C for typical applied power conditions, for CFA piles and for rotary piles with four or more pipes at circumferential spacing of less than 550\u00a0mm.\n\n\n\u2022\nFor rotary piles the CJRM will always underestimate the temperature response function at mid time, while for CFA piles it may over estimate it.\n\n\n\u2022\nErrors of approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C or less are obtained for larger diameter CFA piles, for rotary piles with many pipes and for cases of high concrete conductivity with respect to the ground conductance.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe CJRM model requires very few fitting parameters, so is likely to be more robust than highly parameterised models requiring extensive inverse modelling.\n\n\n\u2022\nFast run times can be achieved making the method suitable for use in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nNomenclature\nCJRM\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Claesson\u2013Javed Radial Model (analytical model); CS\u00a0\u2013\u00a0circumferential separation of pipes; EGM\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Equivalent Geometry Model; GHE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Ground Heat Exchanger; TRT\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Thermal Response Test.\n\nGreek Symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nDensity (kg\/m3)\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nThermal conductivity (W\/mK)\n\n\n\n\n\u03a6\n\n\nDimensionless temperature (\n=\n2\n\n\u03c0\n\u0394\n\n\nT\n\n\nf\n\n\n\/\nq\n)\n\n (-)\n\n\n\n\nRoman Symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nCross-sectional area (m2)\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\nThermal diffusivity (\n\n=\n\u03bb\n\/\n\n\n\u03c1\nc\n\n\n\n) (m2\/s)\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\nSpecific heat capacity (J\/kgK)\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nThermal capacity per unit depth (J\/mK)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nThickness of pipe (m)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\nDepth of aquifer (m)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\nDepth of borehole\/pile (m)\n\n\nh\nFluid convective heat transfer coefficient (W\/m2K)\n\n\n\n\n\nF\no\n\n\n\nFourier number (\u2013)\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nNumber (w.r.t. pipes this means number of pipes counted over a horizontal cross-section) (\u2013)\n\n\nQ\nPower (W)\n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\nPower per unit depth\u00a0(W\/m)\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nThermal Resistance\u00a0(mK\/W)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\nThermal Resistance of borehole (i.e. fluid to outer boundary of borehole)\u00a0(mK\/W)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\nThermal Resistance of GHE material (concrete or grout) (mK\/W)\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nRadial distance (m)\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nTime (s)\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nVelocity (m\/s)\n\n\n\n\nSubscripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nInitial\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\nGHE filling material (typically concrete or grout for pile GHE)\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\nHeat-exchanger fluid\n\n\n\n\ng\n\n\nGround (soil)\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\nInner\n\n\n\n\n\ni\nn\nj\n\n\n\nInjection\n\n\n\n\no\n\n\nOuter\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\nPipe\n\n\n\n\n\np\ne\n\n\n\nEquivalent pipe (for the radial approximation)\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nFleur Loveridge: Conceptualization, Methodology, Resources, Data curation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization, Project administration, Funding acquisition.

A forecast of initial axial capacity of piles installed by impact driving can be achieved by prediction methods based on cone penetration tests (CPTs).\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n Recent prediction methods are specified in the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s design code\n3\n and are now partly implemented in the standard procedure in geotechnical engineering. In contrast, a prediction of pile setup is still hampered by numerous uncertainties about its causing mechanisms and by the large scatter of pile setup observations in existing databases.\n4\n As a result, pile setup predictions have yet not been fully considered in daily engineering practice. Additionally, Lim and Lehane\n5\n and Anusic et al.\n6\n demonstrated in their studies that the use of different installation methods (e.g.,\u00a0impact driving, jacked piling) directly affects both initial pile capacity and pile setup. The different initial pile capacities and observed setup were considered to reflect the number of shear cycles during pile driving, which vary between the installation methods.\n6\n This underlines that neither initial pile capacity nor pile setup characteristics can be sufficiently predicted when the piles are not installed by the traditional way of impact driving.\nAn alternative installation method is vibratory pile driving. This method features faster drivability, better pile handling, less noise emission, and reduced material fatigue compared to the conventional method of impact pile driving.\n7\n\n,\n\n8\n These advantages provide a high potential in cost reduction, especially for the offshore renewable energy industry, which depends on the installation of large-sized piles. A better understanding of the interrelation between different installation methods, initial pile capacity, and pile setup would allow for a more efficient pile design and thus to significant economic benefits for project developers and investors.\nThis study aims for better understanding the effect of installation methods on initial pile capacity and pile setup. For this purpose, the change in pile tension capacity over time was measured in a long-term field experiment using a high number of small piles driven by one of four different installation methods. 44 close-ended piles with a diameter of 35\u00a0mm were installed to a maximum penetration depth of 12.1\u00a0m in a very dense natural glaciofluvial sand deposit at a sand pit in Northern Germany (Fig.\u00a01A). Impact driving, pile jacking, and two scenarios of vibratory pile driving were used to install piles into the ground. The four installation methods vary with respect to the number of shear cycles the soil experiences during pile installation. Furthermore, the influence of potential corrosion was investigated by using two different steel qualities (i.e.,\u00a0mild steel, stainless steel). Because pile setup has been observed to affect pile shaft capacity alone\n9\n\n,\n\n10\n the piles in the present study were tested by static tension load tests.\n\n\n\nThe test concept addresses the following three questions:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nHow does a variation in installation method affect the initial capacity of displacement piles?\n\n\n\u2022\nHow does a variation in installation method affect the pile setup?\n\n\n\u2022\nTo what extent does the axial pile setup depend on potential corrosion of the pile material?\n\n\n\nThe onshore test site comprises dense glaciofluvial sands and can be seen as an equivalent to subsoils in the North Sea. The test site was also selected for two large-scale vibratory pile driving projects in the past, namely the VIBRO and VIBRO-RE-Strike project. Together with the present study and numerous similar geotechnical investigations, this onshore test site may be considered as one of the best investigated pile testing sites in the world (see e.g. Refs.\u00a018\u201323).\n\n\n2\nStudy site\nThe study site is located in a sand pit at the northern part of the Cuxhaven\u2013Bremerhaven\u200b ridge \n\u223c\n7 km south of Cuxhaven, north Germany (Fig.\u00a01A). The ground level of the test site will be used as a reference and is at an average height of 7.8\u00a0m above sea level. An anthropogenic layer 30- to 45-cm-thick of recycled sub-grade material builds up the topmost stratigraphic unit (Fig.\u00a02A). The underlying natural glaciofluvial dense to very dense sand layers were deposited during the Middle Saalian ice advance of the Quaternary.\n24\n\n,\n\n25\n They are mostly horizontally stratified and exhibit internal crossbedding of different dimensions from decimeters to meters. This crossbedding generates a certain degree of uncertainty when comparing cone penetration tests (CPT) performed throughout the test site.\n26\n At around 4\u00a0m below ground level (mbgl), these sand deposits are interlayered with a 0.5 to 1.5-m-thick Saalian till layer composed of clayey silty sands and gravel. The water table is commonly located above the till layer at a depth of \n\u223c\n3.5 mbgl but is subjected to seasonal and also daily fluctuations The groundwater can be classified as fresh water with chloride concentrations of \n\n\u223c\n50\n\nmg\n\u2217\n\n\nl\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n.\n27\n The soils above the ground water table can be considered as moist but not fully saturated on an annual basis with water contents of 18%\u201320%.\n12\n\n\nSediment description, grain size analyses (DIN 18123\n15\n), and minimum and maximum void ratios (DIN 18126\n14\n), obtained from two boreholes near the test site (SAM 1 & SAM 2), characterize the subsoil in the present study (Figs. 1B, 2A\u2013C).\n12\n\n,\n\n13\n From ten cone penetration tests performed throughout the test site (Fig.\u00a01C), cone resistances vary from few hundreds kPa for the till layer to maximal values of 45 MPa for the very dense sand intervals (Fig.\u00a02D). Considering the cone resistance\u00a0\u2013\u00a0relative density relationship of Baldi et al.,\n16\n the sandy subsoil profile at the test site is classified as \u201cvery dense\u201d for about \n\u223c\n70% of the installation depth (Fig.\u00a02E).\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nInstallation concept and pile material\nIn the present study, 44 steel piles were installed in a rectangular grid (Fig.\u00a01C) using one of four different installation methods: impact driving (ID), jacking (J), and vibratory driving with two different cyclic strain scenarios (Vcss1, Vcss2). The minimal spacing of 100\u00a0cm between piles and CPTs was chosen to minimize any interaction from the neighboring piles and CPTs following the recommendation of Al-Sammarraie.\n26\n The piles had an outer diameter of 35\u00a0mm, were closed-ended, and segmented into one-meter-long pieces. The pile segments were connected by headless screws and assembled with a fixed torque of \n\u223c\n30\u00a0Nm. The pile toes comprised 60-degree cones in order to facilitate pile driving.\n35 piles were constructed from mild steel (material number 1.0546 following DIN EN 10027-2\n28\n), a steel type common in offshore pile foundations and not resistant against corrosion. In the following, tests with mild steel piles are labeled with an \u201cm\u201d hereafter. Nine piles were constructed from stainless austenitic steel (material number 1.4404 following DIN EN 10027-2\n28\n) to exclude the influence of corrosion on test results. The stainless steel piles are labeled with an \u201cs\u201d hereafter. The final penetration depth was \n\u223c\n12.1\u00a0m below ground level. For every pile, a 30- to 45-cm-long casing was used in order to avoid potential effects of the anthropogenic gravel layer and to provide a frictionless access to the natural sand deposits underneath (Fig.\u00a03). The arithmetic average height parameter also known as center line average roughness (\n\n\nR\n\n\nC\nL\nA\n\n\n after Ref.\u00a029) of both steel types were determined using a digital microscope (VHX 6000, Keyence) and was used for later capacity normalization. The center line average roughness for each steel type is summarized in Table\u00a01. Some pile segments were reused for subsequent piles in order to reduce costs. After piles were extracted from the ground, they were carefully examined for potential changes that could have affected the pile capacity of subsequent piles. Pile segments were only reused, if they did not show any signs of surface deformations, such as scratches, corrosion, changes in color, and bending of entire segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nInstallation methods\nImpact driving was performed using a standard rig for cone penetration testing. The rig was equipped with a free fall weight of 124\u00a0kg, which was dropped from 0.5\u00a0m. The pile head was guided along the mast of the rig to avoid lateral pile deflection. The top of the pile was equipped with a custom-made brass collar, which provided sufficient transmission of impact energy and prevented deformations at the pile top. Pile jacking was performed with a strain controlled hydraulic CPT jacking frame commonly used on CPT trucks. The penetration length of each push was between 0.5 and 1.2\u00a0m at a constant penetration rate of 20\u00a0mm\/s. Vibratory pile driving was performed by a strain controlled hydraulic piston.\n26\n Two different cyclic strain scenarios were used for vibratory pile driving. Both cyclic strain scenarios had the same single-displacement amplitude of 5\u00a0mm at a constant frequency of 20\u00a0Hz. This frequency is typically used for offshore and onshore installation of large piles.\n30\n\n,\n\n31\n In the first cyclic strain scenario (Vcss1) the pile was pushed at a constant penetration rate of 20\u00a0mm\/s. In the second cyclic strain scenario (Vcss2) a larger penetration rate of 40\u00a0mm\/s was used instead, thus reducing the number of shear cycles by 50%. The number of shear cycles necessary to install a pile up to its final depth per unit pile mantle area, \n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n, has been used in the following to code each installation method with just one parameter (Eq.\u00a0(1)) following suggestions of Anusic et al.\n32\n Schematic penetration paths of the four installation methods are presented in Fig.\u00a04. \n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n=\n\n\nnumber\n\no\nf\n\nshear\n\ncyles\n\n\neffective\n\nmantle\n\na\nr\ne\na\n\n\n[\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nStatic tension loading procedure and data acquisition\nFollowing recommendations of Bullock et al.,\n33\n a reference time of 24\u00a0h after end of driving (EoD) was defined to allow full pore water pressure dissipation (Fig.\u00a05). Pile capacity was determined by performing a static tension load test using a hydraulic extraction system. Pile load was controlled by a manual pressure relief valve, which was located at the output of a hydraulic aggregate (Fig.\u00a03). The hydraulic cylinders of the extraction system worked against a steel girder structure with two abutments placed on circular steel plates with distance of 40\u00a0cm to the pile (Fig.\u00a03). This design distributed forces from the static tension load test to the ground avoiding any effects on the measurements. A conical tooth clamp transmitted the pulling forces of the hydraulic extraction system to the pile. The axial displacement of the pile head was measured in real time by a displacement sensor (Burster 8712\u2013150), which was fully decoupled from the pile motion. Rapid movements of the extraction system at the time of break-off were prevented by a throttle valve located between pressure relieve valve and extraction system. On this way, the hydraulic volume flux and thus the potential movement of the pile could be limited. Pressure in the hydraulic system was recorded with a digital pressure sensor (Parker SCP01-250-44-77-07). For converting hydraulic system pressure into force, the hydraulic cylinders were calibrated for steady force increase against a 50 kN force sensor (S9M\/50 kN from HBM). Accuracy of the force determination is \n\u00b1\n1% within the 50 kN test range.\nThe loading procedure followed the German recommendations of EA-Pf\u00e4hle\n34\n for small piles. Loading was done in five to twelve steps with equally spaced loading increments until a continuous axial displacement at the pile head was established. Load increments were calculated as being one eighth of the predicted and assumed pile capacity. Loading was kept for three minutes while axial displacement was recorded.\n34\n If axial displacement exceeded a minimum displacement of 3.5\u00a0mm (0.1 times the diameter), the pile was classified as \u201cfailed\u201d and the maximum force applied was recorded for later processing. In contrast to EA-Pf\u00e4hle,\n34\n no reloading was done after pile failure was reached.\nAfter the initial tension load test, the piles were left in the ground for a time period of either 1, 10, or 100 days until each pile was tested a second time using the same testing procedure in order to obtain for its aged capacity. Due to the minor local soil heterogeneities, a two-time testing approach of each pile was chosen rather than the one-time testing procedure recommended by Jardine et al.\n35\n The elapsed time in between the first and the second tension load test will be referred to as \u201caging time\u201d, hereafter. The flow diagram shown in Fig.\u00a05 illustrates and summarizes the pile installation and testing procedure.\n\n\n3.4\nData management and processing\n\n3.4.1\nShear stress calculation\nThe maximum pile capacity \n\n(\n\n\nQ\n\n\nt\n\n\n)\n\n at failure was calculated from Eq.\u00a0(2). \n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\nF\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nF\n\n\nG\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n represents the maximal force that could be applied to the pile head at the pile break off and \n\n\nF\n\n\nG\n\n\np\ni\nl\ne\n\n\n\n\n is the weight of the pile. Examples for load\u2013displacement curves and the determination of \n\n\nF\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n are given in Fig.\u00a06. Eq.\u00a0(3) yields an average shear stress \n\n(\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n)\n\n of the mantle by means of dividing the maximum pile capacity \n\n(\n\n\nQ\n\n\nt\n\n\n)\n\n by the effective pile mantle area, being determined from the effective pile length \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n and the pile diameter \n\n(\nD\n)\n\n. \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\nD\n\u03c0\n\u2217\n\n\nL\n\n\ne\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Eq.\u00a0(3) axial pile capacities of different small piles can now be directly compared. In the following, \u201cmantle shear stress\u201d and \u201cpile capacity\u201d are used interchangeable dependent on the particular content.\n\n\n3.4.2\nPile capacity normalization using UWA-05 approach\nIn order to eliminate the influence of small soil heterogeneities and to provide international comparability of pile capacities, all piles were normalized to their predicted axial tension pile capacities using the UWA-05 approach.\n3\n\n,\n\n11\n Therefore, a theoretical pile tension capacity was calculated at each CPT location distributed throughout the test site. These theoretical pile tension capacities were calculated from the geometry of the small piles used in this study, their center line average roughness, and the individual CPT profile (see. Table\u00a02). The theoretical UWA-05 pile tension capacities at the CPT locations are \n\n85\n.\n5\n\nkN\n\u2264\n\n\nQ\n\n\nU\nW\nA\n\n\n\u2264\n94\n.\n6\n\nkN\n\n for the mild steel configuration. Due to lower surface roughness of the stainless steel piles \n\n\n(\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nC\nL\nA\n\n\n=\n2\n.\n9\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n instead of \n\n6\n.\n9\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n), theoretical UWA-05 pile tension capacities are also reduced to \n\n50\n.\n4\n\nkN\n\u2264\n\n\nQ\n\n\nU\nW\nA\n\n\n\u2264\n58\n.\n9\n\nkN\n\n. In a next step, the theoretical UWA-05 pile tension capacities at the former CPT locations were interpolated within the entire test site using a kriging algorithm\n36\n\n,\n\n37\n for both steel configurations (see contour map in Fig.\u00a01C). As a result, a predicted UWA-05 pile tension capacity was assigned to every pile on its planned pile location using the interpolated contour map. Predicted UWA-05 shear stresses \n\n(\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\u2212\nU\nW\nA\n\n\n)\n\n were calculated using Eq.\u00a0(3) in combination with the predicted pile capacities extracted from the contour map (Fig.\u00a01C) and the effective pile length of the pile considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3\nSetup calculation\nThe log-linear setup prediction approach after Skov and Denver\n9\n was used in order to describe and classify the temporal change of pile tension capacities (Eq.\u00a0(4)). \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n\n\nt\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n\n\nt\n0\n\n\n\n\n=\nA\nlog\n\n\nt\ni\n\n\nt\n0\n\n\n+\n1\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n\n\nt\ni\n\n\n\n is the mantle shear stress averaged over the effective pile length at the time \n\nt\ni\n\n and \ni\n represents the time in days after EoD. \n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n\n\nt\n0\n\n\n\n is the averaged shear stress of a pile at the time \n\nt\n0\n\n being measured \n\n24\n\nh\n\n after EoD. In this study, the setup factor \n\n(\nA\n)\n\n and the setup ratio \n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n)\n\n after Eq.\u00a0(5) were used to quantify the increase in pile capacity with time. \n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n\n\nt\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n\n\nt\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4\nCurve fitting\nIn order to make statements about the capacity and aging characteristics of piles that are generally applicable, curve fittings have been applied on the data. In these cases, fitting was done by the usage of the MATLAB curve fitting tool. Simplicity of the resulting function was prioritized if no significant increase of the coefficient of determination (R\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n) might result by a formula of a higher degree. Fits were freely calculated by MATLAB using the LAR (least absolute residual) mode. Curve fitting parameters have not been given dimensions to ensure clarity. The fitting functions therefore only retain their validity in the dimensional frame of the axes used.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nInitial pile capacities\nThe installation methods influenced the initial capacities of the small piles tested in this study. Jacked piles failed at the highest initial average shear stress, all the impact driven, and vibratory driven piles failed at similar and lower initial averaged shear stresses (Fig.\u00a07A, Table\u00a03). By normalizing the average shear stresses of each pile to their corresponding UWA-05 shear stress, the scatter in data could be slightly reduced in three out of the four installation methods and for both stainless steel and mild steel materials used for impact driving. This is shown by a reduction in the coefficient of variation in Table\u00a03, being calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean (\n\n\nx\n\n\u00af\n\n), by its related value for the standard deviation, (\n\nS\nD\n\n) or its range.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the initial shear stresses were overestimated by the UWA-05 prediction resulting in normalized average shear stresses smaller than 1 (Fig.\u00a07B). In contrast, the jacked piles, exceeded the expected average shear stresses from the UWA-05 prediction (Fig.\u00a07B). Impact driven piles, for both pile materials were able to withstand shear stresses in between 30% and 49% of the UWA-05 prediction. Vibrated piles covered a wider range of capacities with shear stresses between 21% and 78% than those predicted by UWA-05 (Fig.\u00a07B). The normalized average shear stress decreased exponentially with the number of shear cycles per m\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n effective pile mantle area (simply \u201cnumber of shear cycles\u201d hereafter) (Fig.\u00a07C). Because of the exponential nature of this relationship, a power function with the coefficients \na\n, \nb\n, and \nc\n was fitted to the experimental data (Eq.\u00a0(6) and Fig.\u00a07C). \n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n\n\nt\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\u2212\nU\nW\nA\n\n\n\n\n=\na\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n+\nc\n\n\n{\na\n=\n3\n.\n71\n\n;\n\nb\n=\n\u2212\n0\n.\n62\n;\nc\n=\n0\n.\n37\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe normalized average shear stresses decreased with increasing number of shear cycles. Differences between the initial pile capacities seemed to be negligible for shear cycles roughly above a visual picked \n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n value of \n\n300\n\n1\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n. A lower bound equal to \n\u223c\n40% of the UWA-05 prediction is approached for significant higher shear cycles than \n\n300\n\n1\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n. The initial pile capacity increased strongly towards lower values of \n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n.\n\n\n4.2\nTemporal development of pile capacities\nThe setup of pile capacities was visualized by means of average shear stresses normalized by the UWA-05 approach (Fig.\u00a08A), by the setup factor (Eq.\u00a0(4)), and by the setup ratio (Eq.\u00a0(5)) (Fig.\u00a08B). Piles did not exhibit significant increase in pile capacity after an aging time of one day.\nAfter an aging time of ten days, the jacked piles exhibited a capacity increase (\n\nA\n\u2248\n0\n.\n5\n\n) reaching around 2.2 times the UWA-05 expectation. Setup of all other piles can be considered as negligible instead.\nFor the aging period of 10 to 100 days, the average shear stresses of jacked piles continued to increase, reaching three times the UWA-05 expectation corresponding to an \n\n\n\nR\n\n\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n\n(\n100\n)\n\n\u2248\n2\n.\n7\n\n. Mild steel piles installed by impact driving and piles installed by vibratory pile driving reached average shear stresses, being around one to two times larger than those expected by the UWA-05 prediction (Fig.\u00a08A). When considering setup ratios (Fig.\u00a08B), four out of six piles installed by vibratory pile driving exhibited significantly higher setup than piles installed by impact driving or jacking (i.e.,\u00a0\n\n\n\nR\n\n\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n\n(\n100\n)\n\n\u2248\n4\n.\n8\n\n, \n\nA\n\u2248\n2\n\n), whereas one out of three piles for each cyclic strain scenario showed a significantly lower setup (i.e.,\u00a0\n\n2\n.\n5\n\u2264\n\n\nR\n\n\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n\n(\n100\n)\n\n\u2264\n3\n.\n1\n\n, \n\nA\n\u2248\n1\n\n). These moderate setup ratios for 100 days of aging were more similar to those generated by jacking and impact driving of piles constructed from mild steel.\nThe stainless steel piles had constantly low capacities between 38% and 44% of the UWA-05 prediction after the 10 to 100 days aging period (Fig.\u00a08A). Also, these stainless steel piles had again the lowest relative setup (i.e.,\u00a0\n\n1\n.\n1\n\u2264\n\n\nR\n\n\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n\n(\n100\n)\n\n\u2264\n1\n.\n3\n\n, \n\nA\n\u2248\n0\n.\n1\n\n). The stainless steel piles failed at around one-third of the total average shear stresses of the mild steel piles after 100 days of aging and had less than one-tenth of their relative increases.\nThe setup relationships (i.e.,\u00a0both average shear stress normalized by the UWA-05 prediction and setup ratio) were extended by the number of shear cycles as a third dimension (Fig.\u00a09 A and B). For both cubes, a 3D plane was fitted for all mild steel experiments using a polynomial function. The formulas for these fits are given in Eqs. (7) and (8), and depend on the number of shear cycles (\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n in \n\ncycles\n\/\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n and time after EoD \n\n\nt\ni\n\n\n in days (d). \n\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\n\n\n\nt\ni\n,\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\nv\ng\n\u2212\nU\nW\nA\n\n\n\n\n=\n2\n.\n2\n\u2212\n1\n.\n2\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n\n\n+\n0\n.\n6\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n+\n0\n.\n2\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n0\n.\n2\n\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n)\n\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n+\n0\n.\n3\n\n\n\n[\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n]\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n,\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n)\n\n=\n1\n+\n0\n.\n003\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n\n\n+\n0\n.\n7\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n\u2212\n0\n.\n84\n\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n+\n0\n.\n1\n\n\n\n[\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n]\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n0\n.\n1\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n+\n0\n.\n3\n\n\u00d7\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n[\nl\no\n\n\ng\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n(\nt\ni\n)\n\n]\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two functions represent the experimental data reasonably well (\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n89\n\n and \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n92\n\n for Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively). Following the 3D planes, the normalized pile capacity is rising with decreasing number of shear cycles and with increasing aging time (Fig.\u00a09A). The setup ratio increases with increasing number of shear cycles and with time after EoD (Fig.\u00a09B). The trends displayed in both cubes indicate a nonlinear relationship between pile capacity, number of shear cycles, and elapsed days after EoD.\n\n\n4.3\nField observations\nAfter extracting the mild steel piles from the ground through hydraulic traction, it was observed that the pile surfaces of the uppermost two to three steel segments (reaching \n\u223c\n2\u20133 mbgl) have been corroded. After one day of aging time, the pile surfaces had changed in color from glossy black-metallic to brown. After 10 and 100 days of aging, the pile surfaces of mild steel were extensively coated by brown-greyish agglomerates\/crusts. Fig.\u00a010A provides an example of a mild steel pile aged for 100 days. Exemplary sand crusts adhering the uppermost two to three pile segments are presented in Fig.\u00a010B. Roughness measurements were performed on crust patches that were essentially unaffected by the extraction process and yielded a strong increase in mean center line surface roughness from \n\n\n\nR\n\n\nC\nL\nA\n\n\n=\n6\n.\n9\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n before installation to \n\n30\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\u2264\n\n\nR\n\n\nC\nL\nA\n\n\n\u2264\n200\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n after 100 days of aging. No obvious change in crust thickness or shape could be observed when comparing pile segments used for the four different pile installation methods. Any signs of corrosion products rapidly decreased below the second up to the third mild steel segment. Glossy white-metallic steel dominated the pile surface from the fourth steel segment and below (\n\u223c\n4 mbgl). The stainless steel pile segments did not show any signs of crust formation or change in surface roughness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nFactors controlling initial pile capacities\nOur 44 initial pile capacity measurements showed that the initial pile capacity highly depends on the method used for pile installation. Furthermore, the results presented herein confirm the approach of Anusic et al.\n6\n to code the pile installation method by means of its number of shear cycles during installation. By dividing the number of shear cycles by mantle area, the simple parameter \n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n\n (Eq.\u00a0(1)), can be obtained to distinguish different pile installation methods and their resulting discrepancies in initial pile capacity.\nAn increased number of shear cycles significantly lowers the mobilized averaged shear stresses of a pile, i.e.,\u00a0its axial capacity (Fig.\u00a07C). This is in good accordance with observations of Anusic et al.\n6\n and Lim and Lehane,\n5\n who linked installation methods that cause low number of cycles (i.e.,\u00a0like pile jacking) to more capable piles. On the other hand, a lower initial capacity was observed by these authors, if the number of shear cycles was increased. However, with the results of this study we are able to complement their findings by incorporating the method of vibratory pile driving.\nThe proposed log linear relationship of Anusic et al.\n6\n does not describe the data of our study sufficiently. The presented data of this study have a more asymptotic relation between initial pile capacity and number of shear cycles and reach a constant lower capacity bound when \n\n\nN\n\n\nb\nA\n\n\n values of significantly more than \n\n3001\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n have been reached (Fig.\u00a07). This lower initial capacity bound for moderate number of shear cycles has never been observed before.\nThe similar initial capacities of piles installed by impact driving and vibratory pile driving observed in this study are in contrast with installations of large-scale piles, in which vibratory pile driving commonly caused significantly lower axial capacities compared with impact driving (see e.g., Refs.\u00a011, 36). Reduced size centrifuge experiments conducted by El Haffar et al.\n40\n observed higher capacities for cyclical than for monotonical jacked piles. Both studies stand in a clear discrepancy to our findings and might indicate that also the size of the pile and\/or the equipment used for pile driving influences the initial pile capacity to some extent. Further research tackling this connection would be needed to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.\nThe axial pile capacity degradation with the number of shear cycles recognized for our pile size is in accordance with the theory of friction fatigue. Heerema\n41\n as well as Jardine and Chow\n42\n described this effect and, e.g., Gavin and O\u1e30elly,\n43\n White and Lehane,\n44\n and Yang et al.\n45\n could measure the impact of friction fatigue by analyzing stresses acting on model piles and their vicinity.\nFriction fatigue as a soil mechanism explains the reduction of the acting radial stress with a rising number of shear cycles in between the pile mantle and a distinct soil element: Each shear cycle or blow forces a small and densified soil element in the vicinity of the pile into a dilative response. As a consequence of multiple dilative responses, the granular structure becomes successively more disturbed. Previous force chains are interrupted and the transmission of lateral stresses to the pile mantle is hampered. Thus, the axial capacity of the pile is progressively diminished with a rising number of shear cycles.\n46\n\n,\n\n47\n White and Lehane\n44\n observed the existence of a lower stress bound surrounding their model piles after a high number of cyclic movements, which is very similar to our lower capacity bound in Fig.\u00a07C. Their interpretation involved the separation of radial stress in a static and a dilative component. The static component is reduced by each further shear cycle, whereas the dilative stress component can maintain its developed stress peaks even over a very high number of cycles. This dilative component occurs only when the pile induces a relative soil displacement (i.e.,\u00a0during pile loading). The lower capacity bound observed in Fig.\u00a07C might be caused by the residual dilative stress component acting on the pile after all the previous static stress was reduced by cyclic pile movements.\nThe initial capacities of piles installed by vibratory pile driving observed in this study exhibited much higher variability than the capacities of piles installed by impact driving, which may have been caused by wobbling of the piles due to vibration. The magnitude of pile wobbling was potentially a function of soil properties (e.g.,\u00a0soil stiffness, soil strength, relative density). The pile wobbling may have been prevented, if a force-controlled installation method was used.\nIf maximum initial pile capacity is prioritized over drivability, a minimum of induced installation shear cycles must be aimed for. As a consequence, the installation methods of jacking and impact driving, which apply a low number of blows, are the preferred methods. If logistics, handling, noise, material fatigue, and installation speed are the priority, vibratory pile driving is the favored method. The lower initial capacity limit of \n\u223c\n40% of the UWA-05 prediction (Fig.\u00a07C) might be a value to be used for the preliminary design of initial pile capacity. These recommendations are only directly applicable to small piles in very dense sands and will become less reliable for deviating boundary conditions. Further studies are needed to extend our gained knowledge of initial pile capacity to more diverse soils and pile geometries.\n\n\n5.2\nTemporal evolution of pile capacities\nOur data demonstrate that in addition to the initial pile capacity, the pile setup is highly depending on the pile installation method too (Fig.\u00a08). This observation is in good accordance with experiments performed by Lim and Lehane\n5\n as well as by Anusic et al.\n6\n The coding via the number of shear cycles suggested by Anusic et al.\n6\n seems also useful to distinguish pile setup characteristics (Fig.\u00a09) in addition to initial capacity. However, we observed that the elapsed time after EoD remains an important parameter that influences setup. The effect of elapsed time after EoD was not considered by Anusic et al.\n6\n probably due to a lack of pile data. The multi parameter approach, as developed in this study (Fig.\u00a09), indicates that setup strongly depends on the number of shear cycles and the elapsed time after EoD. If only one of these factors was considered by itself, a capacity prediction would be erroneous. This can be seen in Fig.\u00a08B, where our data clearly not follow the log-linearly setup prediction approach of Skov and Denver.\n9\n\n\nAll setup data from Anusic et al.\n6\n and our study that considered an aging time of more than 40 days, confirm that a pile subjected to a higher number of shear cycles exhibits a more pronounced setup (Fig.\u00a011). This will also be valid, if we resort to a two-dimensional representation due to a lack of available data points for a more detailed 3D comparison. The theory of stress re-equilibration postulated by Lim and Lehan\n5\n and supplemented by Zhang and Wang\n48\n may be suitable to explain this general effect of a higher setup induced by more shear cycles. Both publications redefined setup to be a process of soil recovery rather than a process of capacity gain as it was previously described by Chow et al.\n49\n Following Lim and Lehane,\n5\n the natural stress state is disturbed during pile installation. These disturbances in turn can be quantified by friction fatigue, which depends on the number of shear cycles. Subsequently, the stress disturbances re-equilibrate with time and lead to increasing normal stresses on the pile mantle. This results in a net increase in pile capacity. Our data show that more disturbance (caused by more shear cycles) generates a lower initial capacity but a more pronounced setup over time (Fig.\u00a09B). Lim and Lehane,\n5\n thus combined the conceptual models of cycle-dependent friction fatigue, acting during installation, with soil and stress recovery over time (i.e.,\u00a0setup).\nThe setup data of this study deviate from this theory of temporal stress re-equilibration in two points:\n(1) Following the stress re-equilibrium concept, mild and stainless steel piles installed by impact driving would both be expected to experience a similar setup. However, the setup for these two different steel types differed by one order of magnitude (Fig.\u00a07A and B).\n(2) Only minimal setup is expected for jacked piles following the stress re-equilibration concept, as jacking represents the least disturbing installation method (i.e.,\u00a0lowest number of shear cycles). Our jacked mild steel piles however experienced a remarkably strong setup compared with the literature (Fig.\u00a011).\nAn attempt is made to explain these two differences in the following chapter. The influence of the in this study used two-time testing instead of one-time testing procedure recommended by Jardine et al.\n35\n can be considered as negligible. Otherwise, our 1-day aged capacities would be consistently smaller than the initial capacities measured 24\u00a0h earlier. Since this is not the case (Fig.\u00a08), the setup within this one day even for the stainless steel piles is larger than the damage caused by the two-time testing. We can recommend this procedure for test sites where minor soil inhomogeneities might lead to a higher methodological error otherwise.\n\n\n5.3\nCorrosion effects\n\n\nThe deviation of the stainless steel piles from the setup characteristics of the impact driven mild steel piles can\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in absence of other differences except for the slightly lower initial roughness of the stainless steel piles \u2013 only be explained by their differing corrosion characteristics. Stainless steel piles had only 10% of the setup of their mild steel equivalents, indicating that corrosion controlled about 90% of the setup in this case (Fig.\u00a08). This is in good accordance with findings from Carroll et al.,\n51\n\n,\n\n53\n Lehane et al.,\n54\n and White and Zhao,\n55\n who also identified corrosion as the major factor for their setups. Other publications, such as Gavin,\n56\n instead, explicitly excluded corrosion as major factor since setup has also been observed in studies on wooden and concrete piles. The remaining 10% setup of our stainless steel piles proves that corrosion in turn is also not sufficient to explain this setup behavior alone. Only a combination of both factors\u00a0\u2013\u00a0corrosion and stress re-equilibration\u00a0\u2013\u00a0explain all observations. Since a strong dependency between the installation method and the setup could nevertheless be demonstrated for all the mild steel piles used (Fig.\u00a09B), there has to be also an interaction\/superimposing of corrosion \u2013 which should act equally for all mild steel piles\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and the re-equilibration of the stress field. Otherwise, the differences in capacity between the individual installation methods for the same pile material could similarly not be explained.\n\nThe unexpected setup of jacked piles is analyzed by plotting the setup ratios of piles installed with a low number of cycles against the cone resistances of their respective test sites (Fig.\u00a012). Piles installed in denser soils by low number of shear cycles tended to exhibit higher setup ratios. All piles plotted in Fig.\u00a012 were made from mild steel with directly or indirectly reported formation of iron oxide incrustations. Thus, we conclude that additional friction due to the iron oxide crusts is transferred more efficiently into a larger soil volume around the pile in denser sands. This explanation is further supported by a pile from Gavin et al.\n52\n shown in Figs.\u00a011 and 12 with an exclamation point. This pile was installed in a test location with high cone resistance resulting in a setup ratio comparable with this study.\nSince there is evidence that corrosion effects have a disproportionate influence on capacity when dealing with relatively small piles,\n53\n these findings cannot yet be applied to larger diameters. Further experiments with different pile diameters are needed.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study reports pile capacity measurements on 44 small piles performed in a dense natural sand deposit. Our approach of using mild and stainless steel piles as well as four different cyclic strain scenarios for pile installations provided a comprehensive insight into the initial pile capacity and setup characteristics. The following conclusions were made.\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe study supports the approach of Anusic et al.\n6\n to use the number of shear cycles as a suitable parameter to account for the soil disturbance during installation. This value influences both, the initial capacity of a pile and its setup.\n\n\n\u2022\nA higher number of shear cycles resulted in a lower initial pile capacity. A lower bound of capacity was observed for piles installed by significantly more than \n\u223c\n300 \n\n1\n\/\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n shear cycles.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe evolution of pile capacity can be described using a 3D plane as a function of the number of shear cycles induced during pile installation and the elapsed time after EoD.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe relationship published by Skov and Denver\n9\n for setup prediction seems to be oversimplified since the influence of pile installation is not taken into account.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe setup of small piles made from mild steel that were installed in dense sand seems to be dominated by corrosion effects.\n\n\n\u2022\nSetup was explained by combination of at least two factors: Stress re-equilibration over time controlled by friction fatigue and the corrosion of the pile\u2013soil system.\n\n\n\u2022\nCorrosion has to interact somehow with the installation dependent stress re-equilibration over time.\n\n\n\u2022\nEven mild steel piles subjected to a low number of shear cycles \n\n\n(\n\n\u2264\n3001\n\/\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n) exhibited substantial setups due to corrosion (especially in dense sands) even though the stress re-equilibration theory after Lim and Lehane\n5\n would have predicted otherwise.\n\n\n\nMore reliable pile capacity prediction can only be developed if the axial setup will be understood as a multidimensional and multi-factorial process. More studies using different pile diameters with inert and corrosive materials at test sites with wider ranges of soil densities are required.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAlexander V.

Over the last decades, new subsurface energy storage, production, and disposal systems have emerged to advance the utilization of the subsurface while protecting the environment. These will play a key role in meeting the increasing global energy demand\n1\n as the world\u2019s population and the extensive economic and technological development continues to grow and expand whilst continuing to decarbonize energy systems to meet carbon neutrality goals. However, the complexity in characterizing the subsurface and the involvement of multi-physical processes hinder our ability to benefit from the full potential of these systems and thus provide optimal and sustainable subsurface solutions. To address such complexities, geomechanics concepts are continuously evolving, deviating from the core of geotechnics, and incorporating fundamental concepts in physics, geochemistry, and geo-biology.\nIn this regard, the journal of Geomechanics for Energy and the Environment (GETE) is actively contributing to bringing forward research advances in geomechanics while promoting cutting-edge, innovative, and creative techniques. In particular, four energy technologies are being currently widely examined according to the trends of this journal: (1) Energy geo-structures, (2) Geological CO2 storage, (3) Nuclear waste disposal technologies, (4) Hydrocarbon and Geothermal Reservoirs to overcome the associated technical and scientific issues.\nThe use of geotechnical structures as heat exchangers (so-called energy geostructures) to extract geothermal energy from shallow soil depths have been extensively discussed, however, new challenges are arising as these systems are being put into practice and as their use is expanding to different geostructures beyond piles, such as tunnels, anchors and walls.\n2\n\n,\n\n3\n The issues mainly arise from the additional thermal loads on the structure itself, the soil\u2013structure interaction, and the surrounding soils in addition to the construction and organizational issues which should be tackled to ensure safe and efficient application. Unconventional reservoirs are offering a long-term potential for energy supply, either oil and gas or geothermal energy. However, these reservoirs pose technological challenges to enhance their permeability in order to reach an economical flow rate with hydraulic stimulation being the most commonly adopted technique nowadays. These challenges are related to the complex properties of the reservoirs (heterogeneity, anisotropy, and high in-situ stress levels) along with complex in-situ conditions that involve high temperatures. Yet, not only multiphase non-isothermal flow in subsurface porous\/fractured media under challenging conditions should be considered, but long-term biological effects should also be explored to maximize the production while ensuring the sustainability of operations. To contain energy waste (CO2 and nuclear waste), underground engineered systems are being considered. For the high radioactivity nuclear waste, a series of engineered barriers (buffer material), in addition to the natural barrier (host formation), will retain the radionuclides and isolate the nuclear waste. However, both the engineered barriers and the host formation will be subjected to the heat generated by the waste, water infiltration after excavation, gas migration due to canister corrosion, and the induced chemical interactions which must be taken into account while estimating their short- and long-term performance. As for the CO2, it will be injected in deep high permeability and porosity reservoirs. The long-term, viable storage and reservoir safety will rely on the existence of an overlaying caprock formation that serves as a hydromechanical barrier and prevents CO2 migration to the surface. Technical issues involve fluid flow problems due to the fluid pressure of the reservoirs. As pressure increases, it will affect the permeability of the caprock, along with the chemical reactivity of CO2 with the groundwater within the reservoir and the caprock. This will create chemo\u2013hydro\u2013thermo\u2013mechanical couplings which will alter the behavior of the involved geomaterials. For all these issues, the subsurface resource production operations may have harmful environmental impacts such as inducing earthquakes, surface deformations, change of groundwater, and gas leakage.\nDealing with such technical issues is a priority to ensure safe and efficient implementation of all these emerged subsurface energy technologies but it requires developing our understanding of the basic concepts and methodologies governing the involved multi-physical processes and the geomaterial coupled behavior. This paper will reveal the main trends and developments relevant to these four systems based on the contributions of the journal and highlights accordingly the knowledge gaps and future research opportunities in geomechanics.\n\n\n2\nCurrent trends and developments\n\n2.1\nEnergy geostructures\nEnergy geostructures, which are geotechnical structures incorporating geothermal heat exchangers, provide convenient solutions to secure renewable energy for heating and cooling needs with a lower cost than the traditional ground heat exchangers (GHE).\n4\n Energy piles are the most common energy geostructure, involved in over 157 projects worldwide\n5\n but they now include earth retaining structures, shallow foundations, tunnel lining, and anchors. To enable a safe and reliable design and implementation of such structures, the effect of thermal loading on the geostructure itself, the surrounding soils, and the soil\u2013structure interactions should be quantified and best practices for installing geothermal loops should be identified.\nIn recent years, great efforts have been made to evaluate and optimize the thermal performance of energy geostructures by developing appropriate thermal analysis approaches (analytical and numerical).\n2\n Currently, advanced three-dimensional finite element numerical simulations on the long-term thermal response of GHEs, energy piles, energy tunnels, and walls are employed using COMSOL Multiphysics. Such simulations revealed that the efficiency of GHEs improved when incorporating the surface temperature fluctuations\n6\n which would allow the GHEs to be shortened up to about 11% and helped identify the effect of construction parameters (concrete cover, the distance between shafts, and pile spacing) on the temperature distribution of the cross-section of energy piles and thus accurately estimate the induced axial stresses.\n7\n Energy tunnels do not only exchange heat with the surrounding ground in the same way as energy piles as they also interact with the air inside the tunnel requiring true three-dimensional models to model and couple the ground, tunnel GHEs, tunnel air, and groundwater.\n8\n The tunnel thermal performance showed a dependency on the groundwater flow velocity which could assist in ensuring the air ventilation system of tunnels is designed appropriately.\n8\n Additionally, as different types of energy geostructures are being applied in practice, the thermal interaction between those in close proximity are starting to draw attention. For instance, early insight into the thermal interaction between tunnel GHEs and nearby borehole heat exchangers (BHE) demonstrated that the thermal performance of the BHE are improved by the operations of the nearby tunnel GHEs.\n9\n Such results reveal a potential to reduce the installation costs of BHEs as fewer or shorter BHEs will be required to achieve the needed thermal energy if placed near the tunnels, especially for heating dominant climate conditions.\nThe thermo-mechanical response of energy geostructures has been widely investigated using full-scale experiments,\n3\n\n,\n\n10\n\n,\n\n11\n centrifuge experiments,\n12\n or numerical models\n13\n\n,\n\n14\n to check their serviceability. Coupled thermo\u2013hydro\u2013mechanical finite element simulations validated against full-scale or centrifuge experiments are developed also using COMSOL which include an appropriate plasticity model for the soil and the soil\u2013pile interface to assess the long-term energy pile mechanical response under different energy demand scenarios and soil conditions.\n13\n\n,\n\n15\n However, only simplified models for the thermal and thermo-mechanical behavior of the thermo-active diaphragm walls are employed nowadays showing that the thermally induced axial stress changes are significant.\n16\n As such, the effect of thermal cycles on the mechanical response of thermo-active walls should not be ignored. The first investigation on the thermo-mechanical aspects governing the behavior of energy sheet pile walls based on a 3D finite element model and results of full-scale in situ tests lately highlighted the critical role of the initial conditions and thermal boundaries.\n17\n\n\nFull-scale experiments are needed to validate the numerical and analytical design approaches for energy geostructures. The most available ones are for single energy piles\n10\n which recently indicated that energy piles in soft soils underwent temporal downward movements unrelated to the pile thermal deformations\n11\n and that their response depends on the end-restraining conditions\n3\n and the operating periods\n18\n Fewer full-scale experiments exist for energy tunnels and walls.\n2\n These include the two tunnel geothermal plants in Stuttgart\u2013Fasanenhof and Jenbach\n19\n indicating that the geothermal operations do not impact the subsurface temperature and the energy sheet pile wall in Napoli\n17\n and the therm-oactive diaphragm wall in Northern Italy\n20\n which gave valuable insights on the involved heat transfer processes.\nDesign standards are now available for GHE and energy piles in France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom but the other energy geostructures mostly require a case-by-case study.\n2\n Recently, a comprehensive performance-based design framework for energy piles has been established underlining that thermal loads effects should only be considered at service limit states.\n21\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nNuclear waste disposal\nNuclear energy is a scalable and low-carbon energy source contributing to the reduction of our global dependence on fossil fuels. However, nuclear energy production generates radioactive waste that requires special procedures for handling, storage, and disposal.\n22\n Nuclear waste with elevated levels of radioactivity remains hazardous for thousands of years and thus entails long-term passive safety repositories. Deep geological formations are a suitable disposal option and are being considered by many countries including France, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, and the United States.\n22\n Research efforts are directed toward the development of appropriate design concepts for deep geological repositories via multi-barrier systems composed of engineered (buffer material) and natural barriers. It is, therefore, crucial to identify the short and long-term performance of both the engineered barriers and the host formation while considering the involved thermo\u2013hydro\u2013chemo processes induced by the waste and the installment\u200b procedure.\nClayey geomaterials such as Opalinus Clay, Callovo-Oxfordian, and Boom clay are potential host rocks for many nuclear waste disposal programs having favorable thermo\u2013hydro\u2013mechanical properties, self-sealing capacity, and the ability to prevent the migration of radionuclides.\n23\u201326\n However, testing such geomaterials is very challenging due to their extremely low permeability, high capillary suction, and brine interactions. Laboratory tests under controlled conditions are required to determine their intrinsic properties and the effect of in-situ conditions (high temperature, high pressure, salinity, gas pressure). Recently, new laboratory practices were developed to overcome these challenges,\n27\n which were proven to be robust and relatively less time-consuming\n28\n and yielded consistent results compared with other conventional and systematic testing methodologies, as demonstrated by a benchmark experimental study on undrained triaxial tests of Opalinus Clay.\n26\n These undrained triaxial tests have shown that the elastic and pore pressure parameters of Opalinus Clay are stress-dependent\n28\n and that the shear strength of the remolded Opalinus Clay samples of different facies is correlated to the clay fractions.\n24\n Gas injection tests under oedometer conditions demonstrated that gas migration has a significant impact on the intrinsic permeability and water retention properties of Boom Clay.\n25\n Other than the conventional laboratory tests, a novel experimental\u2013computational approach was proposed to predict the mechanical properties of such geomaterials (particularly, shales), which links these properties to mineralogical observations through a combination of nanoindentation and SEM-EDS testing.\n29\n This work would help in deriving reliable input data for multi-scale geomechanical modeling of shales, without the need for time-consuming and complicated conventional macroscopic experiments.\n30\n\n\nSimilarly, laboratory tests were widely used to investigate the properties of the different potential buffer and backfilling materials as gas permeability tests, swelling and oedometric compression tests, resonant column tests, and triaxial tests.\n30\u201335\n Mainly compacted bentonite (e.g.,\u00a0MX-80 and FEBEX) and claystone\/sand\u2013bentonite mixtures, recovered from in-situ experiments\n31\n or prepared in the laboratory, were tested. These tests revealed that the gas permeability of bentonite depends on the water content and dry density, both of which vary with the position of the samples in the barrier\n31\n and that their compressibility and thermal volume behavior changes with the salinity of the groundwater.\n32\n They also yielded comparable results to in-situ experiments on the swelling and gas transport characteristics of buffer materials.\n33\n As such, small-scale laboratory tests can be referred to for the design of nuclear waste repositories.\nFull-scale experiments have been implemented and instrumented to examine the behavior of the multi-barrier system under real in-situ conditions and evaluated its feasibility as Grimsel Test Site,\n34\n Mont Terri (Switzerland),\n36\n Meuse\/Haute-Marne Underground Research Laboratory (France),\n23\n\n,\n\n37\n and HADES URF (Belgium).\n37\n These experiments are limited due to the required large scale and associated high cost. Innovative techniques are lately being employed to characterize both the host rock and the buffer material in-situ, as the active distributed temperature sensing (DTS) to estimate the in-situ dry density profile of bentonite\n34\n and the Mini-Seismic Methods (MSM) to measure the dynamic elastic rock parameters.\n37\n\n\nRecent advances in this field also included fully coupled numerical models using research code as CODE-BRIGHT to predict the behavior of the whole nuclear waste disposal system. Using a 3D thermo-hydraulic model for the disposal alternative KBS-3H, the presence of a gap between the buffer material and the host rock was proven to impact the behavior of the repository.\n38\n Fully coupled hydro-mechanical finite element code (also Code Bright) were used to simulate the fracture opening in the host rock by incorporating an integrated fracture permeability model to handle gas flow along variable aperture pathways.\n25\n Other efforts focused on modeling the excavation-damaged zone (EDZ) with Alcolea Rodr\u00edguez et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n36\n presenting an efficient approach to deduce 3D stochastic continuum models of the EDZ from 2D discrete characterizations of the fracture network based on Marked Point Processes.\n\n\n2.3\nGeological CO2 storage\nIn our current global efforts to address climate change, carbon capture and storage (CCS) can actively contribute to achieving the net-zero emissions envisioned by the 2015 Paris Agreement. To date, CCS remains the only viable option available to eliminate hard-to-reduce CO2 emissions from heavy industry (such as cement, iron, steel, and chemical production) with many CCS projects already in operation since 1972.\n39\n However, CCS technology faces public opposition in some countries as the safety and permanence of geological storage of CO2 remains questionable.\n40\n\n\nThe concept is to capture CO2 at source emitters, pressurize it and store it in deep geological formations of high porosity and permeability such as saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and deep coal seams.\n41\n Such reservoirs must be overlayed by a caprock formation of low permeability to prevent CO2 migration to the surface such as shale, anhydrite, or low permeability carbonate rocks.\n42\n To safely store CO2, the effect of CO2 injections and CO2 interactions with the formation brine on the geomechanical and geochemical behavior of the reservoir\u2019s rock and caprock must be evaluated. Laboratory-scale experiments under chemical reactive conditions on reservoir rock and caprocks core samples have generally been conducted for this purpose\u00a0\n43\u201345\n. Recent studies revealed that salinity, pH, and temperature control the fracture mechanical properties of shale caprocks and their fracture growth using the double torsion tests.\n43\n It was also shown that the integrity of the caprocks will be enhanced or impaired depending on their lithology. CO2 injections were found likewise to alter not only the mechanical and hydrological properties of sandstone reservoirs but also the pore network.\n44\n In addition, the initial microporosity of the reservoir\u2019s rock, as oolitic carbonate rocks, directly influences their mechanical strength, failure mode, and elastic properties.\n45\n Valuable insights into the dominant deformation micromechanism that drives macroscopic compaction in such porous carbonates were also provided.\n45\n\n\nMany issues can arise from the CO2 storage systems which include the CO2 leakage through different pathways (wellbore, caprock, geological faults, and fractures) due to chemical and mechanical effects, the ground heave after caprock deformation and the pressure build-up, the seismicity induced by CO2 injection, CH4 leakage and displacement of brine,\n46\n all of which would put the integrity of the whole system at risk. Many advancements have been achieved lately to predict and prevent such issues. For instance, Wolterbeek et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n47\n assessed both chemical and mechanical effects on wellbore cement behavior, a potential leakage pathway, and found that CO2 reactions induced mechanical healing and permeability enhancement of the wellbore cement. Stormont et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n48\n designed a specialized pressure vessel to measure the gas flow through microannuli (the cement-casing interface) while changing the confining pressure, internal casing pressure, temperature, and pore pressures. New dynamic models of CO2-injection-induced fault rupture are now used instead of the commonly employed quasi-static approach to assess the mechanical behavior and the potential for fault reactivation within CO2 storage system. These models coupled multiphase fluid flow and geomechanical simulators while incorporating for the first time the fault rheology and slip velocity using TOUGH-FLAC 2D.\n49\n Other models included the effect of thermal stresses induced by cold CO2 injections on fracture propagation into the caprock using Code Bright.\n50\n CO2 injections would lead to a fluid pressure build-up inside the reservoir, which in turn, lead to poroelastic expansion of the reservoir visualized as surface uplift. Lately, semi-analytical and analytical solutions have been developed to evaluate the surface uplift and the caprock deflection induced by CO2 injections.\n51\u201353\n For instance, Li et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n52\n presented a semi-analytical hydromechanical model of a deformable reservoir coupled with immiscible two-phase flow (CO2 and brine). Poroelastic solutions were also derived to predict the surface uplift based on Fourier representation of the reservoir pressure\n53\n or on superimposing the point source solution to solve fluid injection problems along horizontal and vertical line elements.\n51\n All these solutions were found to align well with the numerical results and therefore provide a useful first approximation for some CO2 storage problems.\n\n\n2.4\nHydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs\nGlobal energy demand continues to grow in order to power the world\u2019s growing population and extensive economic and technological development. The dominant energy sources are still crude oil and natural gas, with shares of 40.8% and 16.2% of global energy consumption respectively\n1\n which are extracted from both conventional and unconventional reservoirs. Conventional reservoirs are porous and permeable (sandstones and carbonates) while unconventional reservoirs have extremely low permeability, which requires specialized and complex techniques to extract oil and gas (Shale oil and shale gas reservoirs).\n54\n On the other hand, as the world moves toward CO2-free energy resources, geothermal energy is gaining increasing attention as an alternative clean energy to oil and gas. Most geothermal resources are also found in unconventional reservoirs leading to the emergence of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), also referred to as Hot-Dry Rock or petro-thermal systems.\n55\n Exploration of these reservoirs (oil and gas and geothermal reservoirs) entails first the enhancement of their permeability with hydraulic stimulation is the most commonly adopted technique. However, hydraulic stimulation, as hydraulic fracturing or shear-induced expansion (also known as hydro-shearing), requires careful design and deployment based on the reservoir properties and specifications to ensure efficient and sustainable operations while keeping induced seismicity at an acceptable level.\n56\n A better understanding of the processes underlying hydraulic stimulation would be gained by monitoring and analyzing tests sites such as Mayet de Montagne and Soultz-sous-For\u00eats test sites or down-scaled in-situ experiments as Grimsel Test Site (GTS) and Bedretto Underground Laboratory for Geoenergies (BULG).\n57\n\n,\n\n58\n Combining in-situ stress determined at the site with pressure, rates, and microseismicity observed during the stimulation would allow determining the representative volume element in which a continuum linear model could be applied.\n57\n Based on such results, Cornet\n57\n recently deduced that the creation of fresh shear zones in a rock mass with its inherently large dilatancy is more stable than the reactivation of pre-existing fractures. This would help in the design of a new shear stimulation protocol to maintain safe levels of induced seismicity. The first findings of the scaled-down stimulation experiments in the Grimsel test site (10\u00a0m scale) shed light on one of the main problems of EGS systems, the scalability, by revealing the large variability in permeability enhancement and induced seismicity at this scale.\n58\n Modeling hydraulic stimulation is also very challenging and still needs improvement with recent contributions targeting the deflection of a hydraulic fracture under a mixed-mode loading (I and II) problem\n59\n and subcritical cracking in acidized carbonate rocks using coupled chemo-elasticity.\n60\n\n\nTo better analyze the hydraulic stimulation and fluid flow and transport in hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs, a characterization of the reservoir rocks under different in-situ conditions is underway (temperature, high stresses, anisotropy, heterogeneity). Numerous laboratory studies have recently investigated the effects of temperature and confining pressure on dynamic elastic properties and permeability of unconventional core samples.\n54\n\n,\n\n61\n Innovative laboratory tests are thus being used, as true triaxial equipped with acoustic emission sensors, X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), and fluorescence of the crack tip to explore the details of the fluid-dynamics at the crack tip\n62\n and fiber optic pressure sensors to monitor pore pressure diffusion.\n61\n A new stress-induced aperture model has been developed to examine the effect of polyaxial stress conditions on the fluid flow in three-dimensional (3D) persistent fracture networks,\n63\n and a new hydro-mechanical simulator (Lagrangian solid mechanics code with an Eulerian fluid flow simulator) has been developed to compute reservoir permeability.\n64\n\n\nIt is now well established that injection and extraction of fluids in both shallow and deep reservoirs can induce microseismicity.\n65\n The different hydro-mechanical coupling associated with the development of seismic motions was recently introduced and detailed by Cornet\n66\n based on four different pore pressure levels. However, Cornet\n66\n also pointed out that fluid injections not only induce seismic motions but also aseismic motions. These aseismic motions could affect volumes equivalent to those associated with a magnitude 5 earthquake and may be developed even after the fluid injection is completed and it exists some evidence of such aseismic slides.\n67\u201369\n In order to evaluate seismic risk, advanced numerical models have been developed which have revealed the different factors affecting the potential of induced seismicity (injection rate, temperature, injection, and production volumes, reservoir permeability, stratification, rock fault, and fracture orientations, and location of injection wells relative to faults).\n65\n\n,\n\n70\n For instance, Haddad and Eichhubl\n70\n demonstrated the importance of poroelastic stress changes on the fault stability for different stacked injection-production scenarios after performing three-dimensional fully coupled geomechanical simulations on Abaqus while Haug et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n71\n focused on identifying the potential impact of geologic factors using 2D Abaqus simulations. Numerical models are also used to predict and assess surface subsidence, another environmental issue related to fluid extraction which is calibrated against large in-situ data sets. In this regard, a new 3D constitutive geomechanical model was proposed which describes the time-dependent deformation of deep sediment reservoirs following hydrocarbon or water extraction from the subsurface.\n72\n Angus et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n73\n also integrated fluid-flow, geomechanical, and seismic modeling to the Valhall reservoir and successfully predicted the surface subsidence. Surface subsidence is also offering insight into subsurface mechanisms initiated by water\/hydrocarbon production. Inversion methods have been recently applied to characterize the geomechanical properties of deep reservoirs and provide an estimate of the parameters controlling the subsurface mechanisms (vertical uniaxial compressibility, compaction coefficient, elastic moduli) using assimilation of PS-InSar, multibeam surveys, GPS, well logs, and extensometer data.\n74\n\n,\n\n75\n\n\nLastly, wellbore instability during drilling is a serious and costly problem during exploration and production. Current contributions are enhancing the wellbore stability analysis by evaluating the allowable drilling mud pressure while considering an appropriate failure criterion for the rock formation and the effect of a temperature difference between the drilling mud and rocks.\n76\n\n,\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nFuture opportunities and emerging priorities\nThere can be little doubt that the work done so far has had made a profound contribution to our understanding of energy production and storage technologies and their associated benefits and risks and has promoted the development of many applications that help mitigate the environmental impact we are having on our planet today. Yet if we are to be able to solve some of the great challenges presented by the likes of escalating energy use and climate change, there remains a great deal of work to be done in these research areas and technologies. Here we have identified a list of emerging priorities that merit further discussion, research, and action to validate the applicability, safety, and cost-effectiveness of energy technologies.\n\n\n\n1.\nWhilst research on energy geostructures can be regarded as advanced, their deployment is relatively new and limited, especially for energy walls and tunnels. A key step missing that will further stimulate their practical application is the development of standard design and analysis approaches. A few efforts have been made in this regard in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and France, but limited only to energy piles. This should be done in conjunction with new regulations that consider the interaction between different energy geostructures at the neighborhood or city scale rather than at an individual project scale, allowing for the economic advantages of these interactions to also be quantified. Some of the least developed analytical techniques include those used to evaluate the thermal and thermo-mechanical behavior of energy geostructures. Despite requiring several assumptions, they have been widely adopted within engineering practices. Only a few attempts to develop analytical techniques for energy piles have been made,\n14\n\n,\n\n78\n BHE,\n79\n and for plane energy geostructures.\n80\n In contrast, numerical techniques have progressively been enhanced but still need to be refined for the analysis of tunnel GHEs and energy walls due to the associated complexities and conditions, such as pipe layout, anchorages, heat input, presence of air and groundwater flow. However, with the emergence of new techniques, we should not be restricted to analytical and numerical solutions. The use of computational intelligence algorithms to predict energy geostructures and the surrounding soil responses will open a whole new area of exploration and more importantly, these algorithms may be beneficial in predicting the long-term behavior of these structures which currently are not possible due to the limited availability of full-scale experimental data.\n\n\n2.\nCertain fundamental understandings of the effect of thermal loads on energy geostructures and soil behaviors are also still missing. Energy piles have experienced ratcheting settlements unrelated to the pile thermal deformation but most likely due to the soil deformation.\n11\n These settlements should be accurately quantified as they could surpass the acceptable pile movement and further alter the interface properties. Furthermore, the mechanisms controlling thermally induced soil deformations at the microscopic scale remain unknown.\n81\n The identification of these mechanisms can help determine macroscopic soil deformations and therefore the design of energy geostructures can be refined. In this regard, using advanced laboratory techniques such as Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP), neutron imaging, and X-ray diffraction techniques could help the observation of microscopic and mesoscopic changes of the soils under thermal loading\n82\n\n,\n\n83\n resulting in new, accurate and robust constitutive models for thermally induced deformation of both fine and coarse soils.\n\n\n3.\nThe data collected from long-term, full-scale experiments and ongoing lab testing and modeling has progressed our understanding of the implementation of nuclear waste disposal systems, yet more is required to ensure their safe deployment at scale whilst ensuring their long-term stability. Currently, there is still a lack of a complete characterization of the properties of the buffer material and the host formation as the physical processes involved are not yet fully known. Host formations involved are complex materials with multiscale heterogeneity and anisotropy. To predict the microporomechanical models of the stiffness and strength properties of the host formation, the mechanical microstructure properties must be determined. The methodology of Veytskin et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n29\n of combining grid nanoindentation and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS\/WDS) was useful for shales, however, this work needs to be upgraded to incorporate 3D correlative X-ray microscopy. This will allow the identification of material phase and porosity distribution in the tested sample volume, which could explain length-scale effects and interaction volumes by adding a new dimensional feature. Further research is required to characterize the form of bonding of clay to quartz and carbonates, as the underlying mechanical, chemical, and physical mechanisms of this bonding are still not understood. More attention should also be paid to the long-term behavior of the buffer material and host formation, which is affected by gas migration processes and can be observed through controlled experimental tests for gas injection to detect whether new fractures will be created, or existing ones will open under gas pressure and how the permeability will be affected. In addition, proper numerical models should be implemented to include the embedded fracture model or more advanced random permeability fields that would enable the heterogeneity to automatically develop fracture patterns, without requiring a predefined fracture zone. Recently, coupling the hydromechanical model with the phase-field method is starting to gain attention for geomaterials, as the method provides a continuous approach to explicitly model the fracturing initiation and propagation within standard FEM.\n84\n This coupling, along with the thermal behavior of the host formation and the buffer materials needs further experimental assessment. These should be incorporated into elasto-plastic models of these materials in the analysis of formation-linear-buffer systems.\n\n\n4.\nCO2 storage knowledge has come a long way, although there is still much to understand. It has been experimentally proven that there is a correspondence between shearing-induced dilation and permeability of porous and permeable reservoir formations owing to the increase of crack density and the opening of microcracks.\n45\n However, quantitative modeling of the permeability enhancement still needs to be developed. We now have evidence suggesting that caprock fracture response depends on fluid chemistry, rock mineral composition, and rockpermeability,\n43\n however, a broader range of rock types should be tested to better understand the effects of mineral composition on fracture growth and fracture initiation under the chemically reactive conditions in a CO2 reservoir and to reach clear conclusions and correlations. In both cases, tracking the evolution of the caprock and the reservoir formation microstructures under different fluid salinity, pH, temperature, and loading conditions would also help to reveal the controlling mechanisms behind the fracture response.\n\n\n5.\nOther areas where our understanding can be expanded include the strain rate and time dependencies of the cement response revealed by Wolterbeek et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n47\n which should be further investigated and incorporated into models for this type of porous rock to ensure the integrity of wellbores. CO2 injection-induced seismicity also lacks advanced dynamic numerical models for distinct types of storage formations and different injection scenarios. These models are necessary to determine the conditions that trigger seismic slippage which will help to identify and achieve safe conditions for CO2 injection and storage.\n\n\n6.\nWhile we are making advances in the understanding of unsaturated soils, there remains much to do. The non-equilibrium suction stress effect on the hydro-mechanical\u200b behavior of unsaturated soils for instance needs further investigation. This could be achieved by performing both hydraulic element tests lately proposed by Milatz et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n85\n and mechanical tests. Alternatively, these hydraulic element tests could also be useful for accurately estimating soil\u2013water transient characteristic curves together with suction stress characteristic curves.\n\n\n7.\nThe influence of pore water salinity on the macroscopic behavior of intact clay soil and rocks, especially structured clays, is also a recurrent problem.\n86\n To date, the presence of diffuse layers has not been considered but could help describe the physicochemical interaction between clay minerals and water. For instance, Tuttolomondo et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n87\n developed a generalized effective stress concept for active clays to highlight the effect of pore water chemistry on the mechanical behavior of saturated active clays.\n\n\n8.\nThe development of technologies to extract geothermal energy or hydrocarbons from unconventional reservoirs is tied to proving their scalability, accessibility, and controllability. Related research is currently based on scaled tests and laboratory experiments; however, it is still unclear how laboratory experiments can be scaled up to full-scale. Current in-situ experiments performed at intermediate scales may offer a possible solution, such as that presented by Gischig et\u00a0al..\n58\n Larger scale experiments closer to target reservoir depths with detailed monitoring systems would present further opportunities to evaluate the feasibility of these technologies and expand our understanding of the processes involved. In parallel, reliable hydromechanical models to simulate hydraulic fracture and to predict surface subsidence and induced seismicity still must be advanced. Seismic data could help calibrate these models as they can provide valuable insights into the intrinsic anisotropy, elastic modulus, and in-situ stress sensitivity of the rock formation.\n73\n It is therefore crucial, to develop new constitutive models that better describe the response of rock formations once the effective stress increases due to hydraulic fracturing. For this, a 3D crack propagation model can capture the brittle deformation response including local concentrations of critically high tensile or differential stresses, as well as the realistic fracture opening and shearing behavior on pre-existing and newly propagated fractures allowing the accurate capture of the 3D flows of fractured rocks.\n63\n Additionally, the creep deformation explored by Cassiani et\u00a0al.,\n72\n should be further enhanced by examining deformation induced by fluid expulsion from these low permeability rock formations which would allow for the depiction of the delayed compaction that drives surface subsidence.\n\n\n9.\nPreviously, the potential for fluid injection to produce damaging earthquakes was not considered significant; but, in recent years, the maximum magnitude of seismic events attributed to hydraulic fracturing has increased reaching M = 4.4.\n65\n Attention should therefore be paid to such events as well as to the aseismic events as proposed by Cornet\n66\n to eliminate any possible risk. Usually, \u201ctraffic light\u201d systems are used to monitor the energy release during operation in geothermal and hydrocarbon reservoirs and appropriate equipment should be used to detect even slow aseismic slips to maintain acceptable surface disturbance.\n66\n In addition, novel approaches for estimating seismic hazards from induced earthquakes should be established\n88\u201391\n taking into account the variations in source locations and fluid injection and withdrawal rates and volumes.\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nConclusion\nGeomechanics for Energy and the Environment journal has become a forum for the fields of energy production, storage, and environmental protection which is a remarkable achievement. Over its brief history, the journal has attracted prominent papers covering the most rapidly emerging, challenging, and revolutionary areas of research, such as energy geostructures, nuclear waste disposal, geological CO2 storage, hydrocarbon, and geothermal reservoirs. Current developments, as presented herein, are underway to expand the fundamentals of geomechanics by adapting these research area requirements and technical issues where multi-physical processes and coupled phenomena (thermo, chemo and hydro couplings) are involved. These include the use of advanced numerical models, innovative techniques to characterize full-scale experiments sites and new appropriate laboratory practices, and the emergence of several testing methods from other disciplines (such as nanoindentation, MIP, and full-field techniques) which would help identifying the distinct nano and micro-mechanisms that govern the macroscopic behavior of geomaterials. Despite these considerable advances, there are still many gaps to be addressed in the future.\nThe journal of Geomechanics for Energy and the Environment will thus continue being at the forefront of all new advances providing the community with innovative and creative international research and applications that enable the future exploration, production, and storage of energy sources and environmental solutions.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nRoba Houhou: Conceptualization, Writing \u2013 original draft.

Injection-induced seismicity is primarily explained by the pore pressure increase which lowers effective normal stresses acting on preexisting planes of weakness in the rock which facilitates slip (e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a03). Production-induced seismicity is less common and requires another explanation since pore pressure reduction actually strengthens rock, faults and fractures. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain production-induced earthquakes. The main one is stress redistribution associated with rock deformation. Fluid extraction and pore pressure reduction lead to a volume loss of the reservoir and increase effective stresses which let the reservoir compact vertically and also shrink horizontally.\n4\u201310\n Such deformation of the rock perturbs the state of stress and can increase shear stresses on faults in or nearby the reservoir which eventually are released during an earthquake. This mostly pertains to normal faulting mechanisms on steeply dipping faults.\n4\n\n\nProduction-induced earthquakes have been and still are a major issue in the giant Groningen gas field in the Netherlands.\n11\u201314\n Earthquakes first appeared in the 1990\u2019ies and increased in number and magnitude to a level that led to production cuts and eventually the decision to phase out production of Europe\u2019s largest onshore gas field by the year 2030, which due to additional damaging earthquakes and public protest has been antedated to the year 2022 (Ref.\u00a015). Earthquakes have also been observed in or in close vicinity to some of the North German gas fields.\n16\u201323\n Since the year 2000, over 40 induced earthquakes with M\n\u2265\n2.0 to M=3.8 have occurred,\n16\n\n,\n\n17\n\n,\n\n19\n\n,\n\n24\n possibly also two larger ones in Soltau M=4.0 and Rotenburg \n\n\n\nM\n\n\nL\n\n\n=\n4\n.\n5\n\n, but it cannot be excluded that the latter two were tectonic events.\n16\n\n,\n\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n Negative impact on buildings, infrastructure etc. has been negligible compared to the situation in the Netherlands (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a023, 27, 28). A reason may be that the German gas fields, although producing from similar Rotliegend sandstone reservoirs, are situated in many cases twice as deep as the gas fields in the Netherlands which implies reduced macroseismic intensities at the surface. However, while in the Groningen gas field operations commenced in 1963 and the first earthquake appeared in 1991 (Ref.\u00a029) most of the producing German gas fields started production some decades later and considering the rapid increase of seismicity in the Groningen field after an initial period of quiescence concern arose that seismicity may increase in the German gas fields as well.\n\nIn an effort to better understand the mechanisms behind depletion induced seismicity and to adapt operations accordingly for mitigating risks, several research studies investigated the controlling factors favouring the reactivation of faults.\n9\n\n,\n\n10\n\n,\n\n27\n\n,\n\n30\u201334\n For gas reservoirs in a geological setting typical for the North German Basin, Haug et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n10\n identified reservoir thickness, the stiffness contrast between reservoir and overburden, steeply dipping faults, and large values for the Biot\u2013Willis coefficient as the most critical parameters.\nSubsequent to the development of a critical stress state on a fault is the release of the accrued stress in an earthquake. Several studies applying numerical methods investigated characteristics of dynamic rupture following the depletion of a reservoir, mostly concentrating on the Groningen gas field.\n30\n\n,\n\n34\n\n\nIn the present study, we combine both modelling approaches\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a static model for the production phase until a critical state on a fault is reached and a dynamic model to study fault rupture and induced earthquake characteristics thereafter. We focus our numerical simulation on reactivation of a fault in an intra-graben setting honouring the typical conditions of Rotliegend gas fields in northern Germany. Thereby, different production configurations and variable vertical offsets at the fault are considered as well as the role of the frictional properties on the fault and the tectonic stress field prior to production. The location of nucleation, directivity of the rupture, temporal evolution of coseismic displacement and final slip are determined along with further focal parameters.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nThe model geometry and hydromechanical rock properties used in this study are inspired by the geological setting of Rotliegend gas fields of northern Germany, but no exact match to a particular field is intended. These gas fields are part of the European Southern Permian Basin which initiated in late Carboniferous to early Permian time.\n35\u201337\n Stratigraphically, the reservoir units belong to the Permian Elbe and Havel subgroups of the Upper Rotliegend.\n37\n Economically important gas reservoirs of \n\u223c\n40\u2013100\u00a0m thickness are located in aeolian and fluvial sandstones with intercalated shales of variable thickness. These shales and, in particular, the overlying evaporites of the Zechstein (Late Permian) constitute the regional caprock. Some of the gas fields are located in fault-bounded structures, i.e.,\u00a0grabens, above volcanic rocks of Lower Rotliegend age, at depths of more than 5 km.\n38\n Other Rotliegend fields are situated above and outside these grabens. The gas fields located in graben positions seem to be more prone to production-induced seismicity. Detailed hypocentre location e.g. Ref.\u00a021 suggests that faults within the graben confining a gas field or an compartment within a gas field rather than the main graben bounding faults are the likely sites of fault reactivation and earthquake occurrence. Therefore, we choose a fault in an overall graben setting as geometry of the generic models and assigned hydromechanical rock properties which are typical for this setting to the various model units.\n\n\n3\nModel set up\n\n3.1\nModelling approach\nWe model the dynamic rupture of a production-induced earthquake based on a critical initial stress state on a fault, which has been reached as a consequence of a pore pressure decrease and which is released during the earthquake. Consequently, the analysis conducted herein is organized in two consecutive steps (Fig.\u00a01). In a first step, the initial stress state is obtained from a static poroelastic model, in which production from the reservoir alters the effective stress in and around the reservoir until the pre-existing fault offsetting the reservoir becomes critically stressed. In a second step, this critical state of stress is taken as an initial state of stress for a dynamic analysis of the rupturing process.\n\nFor these two steps two separate finite element (FE) models are used which are identical regarding their geometry and mesh discretization, but differ in the following aspects: (1) The material behaviour in the first model is poroelastic in order to account for the changes in effective stress associated with production. In the second model, material behaviour is purely elastic as the movements occurring during an earthquake are much faster than fluids can flow in the rock. Accordingly, stresses in the first model are Biot\u2013Willis effective stresses, whereas stresses in the second model are total stresses albeit initially at the same magnitude as the effective stresses obtained in the first model. (2) In contrast to the first model, the second model includes a contact surface which allows for localized frictional sliding. The first model does not include a contact surface since it serves to obtain the state of stress prior to commencement of fault slip. (3) Finally, time steps for calculation (2\u00a0years vs. 0.01\u00a0ms), integration scheme (implicit vs. explicit) and total model time (22\u00a0years vs. 0.2s) of the two models are different. The dynamic model additionally incorporates inertia forces in order to capture the dynamic nature of the rupture, which are neglected in the poroelastic model.\n\nThe criterion used to analyse the state of stress in the poroelastic model with respect to a critical state for failure is the SSR parameter SSR \n\n=\n\u03c4\n\/\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n (shear stress ratio). It is defined as the shear stress \n\u03c4\n on the fault divided by the effective normal stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n and, thus, is basically equivalent to the static coefficient of friction on the fault, which implies that SSR values equal or greater than the value of the static coefficient of friction on the fault in the dynamic model can lead to rupture initiation. More details on this are described in Section\u00a05.\nThe study presented herein builds on the work of Haug et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n10\n that covers the first step, i.e.,\u00a0the poroelastic stress changes due to production from a reservoir and its impact on fault stability. In the following section, we summarize the model set up of the poroelastic model used to generate initial stresses for the dynamic rupture propagation. The reader is referred to Haug et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n10\n and, particularly, Haug\n39\n for more details. The description of the second part of the numerical simulation, i.e.,\u00a0the model for dynamic rupture propagation, follows thereafter.\n\n\n3.2\nModel description\nAt first, the common properties of both models are described and then the specific characteristics of each model are outlined separately.\nThe model represents a 2D vertical cross section through a reservoir section offset by a normal fault (Fig.\u00a02). Although the model is generic, its dimensions and material properties resemble the basic characteristics of compartimentalized Rotliegend gas reservoirs in the North German Basin. The reservoir unit represents an aeolian sandstone with a thickness of 100\u00a0m. In the reference model the vertical offset of the reservoir across the fault is assumed to be half the reservoir thickness (50\u00a0m), but scenarios with offset equal to the reservoir thickness (100\u00a0m) and other amounts of partial overlap (75 and 25\u00a0m) as well as the case without offset (0\u00a0m) of the reservoir across the fault are also considered. The top of the reservoir in the hanging wall remains fixed at 4800\u00a0m depth, whereas the reservoir depth in the footwall is higher by the stated amounts. The fault offsetting the reservoir dips at 60\u00b0. The overburden is a sandstone shale succession, the underburden unit represents Rotliegend volcanics. The model ranges from the earth\u2019s surface to 8 km depth and the horizontal extent of the model is 8 km as well in order to avoid stress perturbations and wave reflections from the model boundaries.\nRock parameters are given in Table\u00a01 for both, the poroelastic model and the model used for simulation of dynamic rupture. The chosen values take log or core data from field operators into account but in view of the generic character of the model and since it consists of only three units the chosen values aim at representing typical values encountered in the Rotliegend sandstone reservoirs and the underlying volcanics.\n40\u201344\n\n\nThe numerical problem is solved using the finite element software package Simulia Abaqus version 2016. The model geometry is discretized using 3.31 Mio. linear 2D plane strain quad elements. The element type used for the poroelastic model has an additional pore pressure degree of freedom (CPE4P), which is not the case in the model for dynamic rupture simulation (CPE4). Element size is about 1\u00a0m in the reservoir unit, becoming coarser towards the boundaries of the model with up to 12\u00a0m. In the vicinity of the fault elements have a constant width of 0.2\u00a0m.\n\n3.2.1\nDescription of the poroelastic model\nInitial pore pressure distribution in the model domain is hydrostatic above the reservoir, assuming a brine density of 1200\u00a0kg m\u22123. At the top of the reservoir on either side of the fault the initial pore pressure is 64.5 MPa, which implies a pressure step at the top of the reservoir. Below, initial pore pressure in the reservoir increases with depth at the hydrostatic gradient according to the density of gas which is assumed as 200\u00a0kg m\u22123. At the base of the reservoir pore pressure increases steadily again with the hydrostatic gradient of brine in the underlying Rotliegend volcanics.\nThe interface between the top of the reservoir and the overlying caprock as well as the base of the reservoir is assigned a pore pressure boundary condition to avoid pore pressure reduction in the reservoir due to fluid outflow from the reservoir into the over- and underburden. The same holds for the lateral edge of the reservoir where it borders the adjacent over- or underburden rock on the opposite side of the fault in order to prevent fluid flow into the sideburden. This implies that the fault separating the reservoir from the sideburden is assumed to be impermeable, which is an observation in many of the Rotliegend gas fields in Northern Germany.\nGravity acts as a body force. The nodes at the surface are not constrained, nodes at the bottom of the model are fixed for displacements in vertical direction to support the overlying rock mass but can move horizontally (Fig.\u00a02). Nodes at the two vertical boundaries of the model are not constrained for vertical displacements and are assigned a horizontal displacement of 4\u00a0m towards the interior of the model to account for an appropriate ratio of horizontal to vertical stress (k ratio). To avoid strong contrasts of the stress field at the transitions between the lithologies the horizontal stresses are not only initialized through lateral shortening but also by a prestress which is incorporated from a model in which the Poisson\u2019s ratio is homogeneous throughout all lithologies (\n\n\u03bd\n=\n0\n.\n25\n\n), which increases horizontal stresses through the Poisson effect when subject to gravity. This horizontal shortening in combination with the prestress results in a k ratio of 0.66 at the intermediate depth of the reservoir. This value is in agreement with stress measurement data from Rotliegend reservoirs in the North German Basin indicating k\n\u223c\n0.6 (Ref.\u00a045). The critical minimum horizontal stress at which fracturing occurs in the North German Basin was estimated to \n\n\n\nS\n\n\nh\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n58\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nV\n\n\n (Ref.\u00a045).\nBefore production starts, a balancing step is performed in order to establish equilibrium between initial porosity, initial pore pressure distribution, gravity, prestress and horizontal shortening of the model domain. Thereafter, production is modelled by pore pressure decrease assigned as boundary condition to the nodes located at 2000\u00a0m distance to the fault, which resembles a vertical well through the reservoir unit. Pore pressure decreases at a constant rate of 2 MPa per year and after the total model time of 22\u00a0years, it has been reduced by 44 MPa. Due to the relatively high rock permeability, pore pressure is reduced rather homogeneouslythroughout the reservoir and no distinct pressure cone develops near the \u201dwell\u201c. In the reference model production is from the reservoir in the hanging wall compartment only (Fig.\u00a02) because typical gas fields under consideration often consist of one main compartment and some smaller neighbouring compartments which are not always under production or where production started later. However, additional scenarios also investigate production from the footwall block only and both compartments, respectively.\nWith ongoing pore pressure decrease stress is monitored after each time step (i.e.\u00a0after every two years of production) along two lines parallel to and on either side of the fault at a distance of 0.2\u00a0m to the fault. The mesh at the fault is discontinuous i.e.\u00a0nodes are split and undergo different pore pressures at either side of the fault during production due to the impermeable fault. As a consequence, effective normal stress builds up in a decoupled manner. The state of stress from the poroelastic model (Biot effective stress) is exported to the dynamic model at the time when a critical state of stress is reached. The dynamic model to which the effective stress is transferred thus considers and dissipates the decoupled production-induced effective stresses on either side of the contact fault that arise from its sealing properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2\nDescription of the dynamic rupture model\nThe model used for computation of dynamic rupture uses the same overall model geometry as described above, but includes a contact surface at which opposite nodes can slip relative to each other if shear stresses exceed the frictional strength given by the coefficient of friction. General understanding of the onset and accrual of seismic slip assumes a decrease of the coefficient of friction from a static to a dynamic value. The transition between the two is often assumed to be a linear relationship depending on a critical slip weakening distance.\n46\n Frictional experiments from the Rotliegend Groningen gas field suggest that faults separating the reservoir from the over- and underburden may show strong velocity-weakening behaviour.\n47\n We apply an exponential decay velocity weakening friction law\n48\n in which the coefficient of friction depends on slip velocity \n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03bc\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nd\n\n\n+\n\n(\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nd\n\n\n)\n\nexp\n\n(\n\u2212\nd\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nd\n\n\n are the static and dynamic values of the coefficient of friction, respectively, \n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n is slip velocity and d is a parameter determining the decrease of the coefficient of friction with increasing slip velocity and vice versa. This friction law accounts for the strong rate dependence of frictional resistance observed in experiments (e.g.\u00a0\u00a0Ref.\u00a049) and introduces restrengthening that allows self-healing.\n50\n In the reference model \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nd\n\n\n are set 0.6 and 0.25, respectively. The parameter d is assumed 0.5, which ensures that the dynamic coefficient of friction is reached at typical slip rates of \n\u223c\n5\u201315\u00a0m\/s. In order to assess the impact of these frictional parameters on resulting slip and stress, variations of these parameters are considered in a parameter study. The pressure-overclosure relationship at the contact is defined as hard, i.e.\u00a0penetration of the surfaces is minimized. Using the explicit solver, the dynamic rupture initiates given the initial stress state and the velocity weakening friction law. Results are monitored at equidistant time steps of 2\u00a0ms.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults of the poroelastic models\n\n4.1\nReference model\nThe temporal evolution of the stress state in the vicinity of the fault resulting from the pore pressure decrease in the reservoir is shown for the reference model in Fig.\u00a03a in terms of the SSR parameter. Thereby, positive SSR values indicate a sense of shear which ultimately results in normal faulting whereas negative SSR values have the opposite sense of shear leading to reverse faulting. For the reference model, SSR values are slightly positive (0.2) above the reservoir and remain so during the entire production history. In the depth interval of the reservoir in the footwall block, SSR values increase and reach a maximum value in the middle of the reservoir, at the depth of the top of the reservoir in the adjacent hanging wall block. In the depth interval of the producing reservoir section, i.e.,\u00a0between 4800 and 4900\u00a0m depth, SSR values decrease with depth and reach negative values at its base, where also the maximum negative SSR value is reached. Below the reservoir SSR values increase again towards zero.\nDuring production, initially positive SSR values increase and initially negative SSR values further decrease. Critical SSR values defined as values equal to or above 0.6 and equal to or below \u22120.6 are reached in the course of production in the lower half of the reservoir in the footwall block, whereas in the hanging wall block critical positive SSR values are not reached during the production period. A sharp spike of negative SSR values develops on both sides of the fault at the depth of the base of the reservoir in the hanging wall block. The SSR values on both sides of the fault differ slightly because of the different pore pressures across the impermeable fault. As a consequence, critical SSR values are reached for different amounts of pore pressure decrease i.e.\u00a0different production periods on either side of the fault, if at all. The changes of the SSR parameter during production are greater in the opposite footwall block than in the hanging wall which is under production.\n\nFig.\u00a03b and c show how the SSR value can be understood in terms of its constituents, shear stress and effective normal stress on the fault. Shear stress is basically the same on the hanging wall and footwall side of the fault, except very locally at lithological interfaces. With production absolute shear stress increases over the reservoir interval. Above and below the reservoir the change in shear stress becomes smaller. The effective normal stress before production however is the same on both sides of the fault only in the overlapping section of the reservoir (4800\u20134850\u00a0m) as well as above and below the reservoir. Normal stress is different on either side of the fault in the depth intervals where the reservoir is juxtaposed against the over- and underburden, respectively (4750\u20134800\u00a0m and 4850\u20134900\u00a0m). Production then increases effective normal stress on the hanging wall side of the fault over the entire reservoir interval (4750\u20134900\u00a0m) with changes being largest in the section where the two reservoirs overlap (4800\u20134850\u00a0m). On the footwall side of the fault normal stress increases only in the upper half of the reservoir in the footwall (4750\u20134800\u00a0m) and decreases over the depth interval of the reservoir in the hanging wall (4800\u20134900\u00a0m).\n\n\n4.2\nProduction configurations\n\nFig.\u00a04 shows SSR values for model variants in which production is from both blocks (Fig.\u00a04a) and from the footwall block only (Fig.\u00a04b). Production from both compartments leads to critical SSR values at the top and above the reservoir in the hanging wall (Fig.\u00a04a) whereas in the reference model with production from the hanging wall only, critical SSR values are first reached at the same depth but in the footwall compartment (Fig.\u00a03a). If production is only from the footwall block, maximum values occur at the top of the reservoir in the hanging wall as in the case of production from both blocks (Fig.\u00a04a,b). Again, temporal changes of SSR values are greater in the adjacent compartment than in the one under production (Figs. 3a, 4b).\nFor production from both compartments the value of SSR=0.6 is reached after 14\u00a0years of production as in the reference model (Figs. 3a, 4a), however rupture initiates after 16\u00a0years in comparison to 18\u00a0years in the reference model. Production from the footwall postpones the attainment of SSR values above 0.6, although SSR values increase faster in the upper half of the reservoir in the hanging wall than in the case of production from both compartments (Fig.\u00a04a,b).\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nFault offset\n\nFig.\u00a05 shows the temporal evolution of the SSR value for fault offsets of 0, 25, 75 and 100\u00a0m for production from the hanging wall only. For all these cases critical SSR values are first reached on the footwall block at 4800\u00a0m depth, the depth of the top of the reservoir in the hanging wall. Thus, with no or small offset of \n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n of the reservoir thickness this corresponds to the upper part of the reservoir in the footwall block (Fig.\u00a04a,b), whereas for 75\u00a0m and 100\u00a0m offset this corresponds to the base of the reservoir in the footwall block or below (Fig.\u00a05c,d). The larger the offset, the earlier SSR\n=\n0.6 is reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4\nStress state prior to production\nIn order to analyse the sensitivity of dynamic rupture with regard to the stress conditions prior to production several alternative prestress states were considered. These alternative prestress states were established by assuming a larger or smaller amount of horizontal shortening compared to the one in the reference model and other values of the Poisson\u2018s ratio used in the prestressing procedure. Note, that these other values of the Poisson\u2019s ratio refer only to the prestressing procedure in which a homogeneous Poisson\u2019s ratio is assumed throughout the whole model domain, which is subject to gravity and horizontal shortening to generate the prestress. In the actual model used for simulating production the Poisson\u2019s ratios stated in Table\u00a01 are used.\n\nFig.\u00a06 shows the temporal development of the stress state on the fault for these alternative prestress states. In the upper row (Fig.\u00a06a\u2013c) the Poisson\u2019s ratio during the prestressing procedure is the same as the one in the reference model (\n\n\u03bd\n=\n0\n.\n25\n\n) but the amount of horizontal displacement applied at the vertical model boundaries is lower (Fig.\u00a06a,b) or higher (Fig.\u00a06c) than in the reference model (4\u00a0m). With less horizontal shortening the SSR values shift to the right, i.e.\u00a0the tendency for fault reactivation in normal faulting sense increases and critical stress levels are reached earlier in production history. In contrast, larger horizontal shortening shifts the curves to the left, i.e.\u00a0farther away from normal faulting and towards reverse faulting.\nIn Fig.\u00a06d\u2013f the Poisson\u2019s ratio used in the prestressing procedure is \n\n\u03bd\n=\n0\n.\n15\n\n or 0.35. With the low Poisson\u2019s ratio of \n\n\u03bd\n=\n0\n.\n15\n\n a larger amount of horizontal shortening is required to come up with an appropriate \n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n ratio in the reservoir unit and as a consequence SSR values become more heterogeneous over the different lithologies (Fig.\u00a06d,e). In contrast, the higher Poisson\u2019s ratio of \n\n\u03bd\n=\n0\n.\n35\n\n requires less shortening and SSR values become less heterogeneous (Fig.\u00a06f).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nResults of the dynamic rupture models\nThe stress state at the time when critical SSR values are reached serves as initial stress state for dynamic rupture simulation. Results of modelled earthquakes are presented in terms of the temporal evolution of displacement on the fault as well as the stress drop and the stress changes in the vicinity of the fault. Additionally, a number of focal parameters are derived as a basis for mutual comparison of different model variants and in order to evaluate the results with respect to typical ranges of earthquakes actually observed.\nMaximum and average displacements refer to the relative fault-parallel displacement between the two sides of the fault. Average displacement is calculated in the depth interval between the upper and lower termination of normal faulting displacement. Seismic moment \n\n\nM\n\n\n0\n\n\n is defined as \n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\nG\n\nA\n\nD\n\n\n\nwhere G is the shear modulus of the rock calculated from Young\u2018s modulus E and Poisson\u2018s ratio \n\u03bd\n according to G \n=\n E\/2(1+\n\u03bd\n), A is the area of the rupture plane and D is the average displacement on that plane. For the seismic moment calculations, the shear modulus of the reservoir is used rather than a slip-weighted value considering the shear moduli of the side-, over- and underburden. The 2D model only provides the downdip width of the rupture area. Therefore, determination of the rupture area requires an assumption on the horizontal length of the rupture area and on its shape. A lower limit for the rupture area would be a circular area with the lateral extent of the rupture equal to its downdip width. A larger rupture area would be a rectangular area with rupture length exceeding rupture width. Calculations of seismic moment were done for both, a circular rupture area and for a rectangular area with constant length of 300 or 1000\u00a0m. The moment magnitude \n\n\nM\n\n\nw\n\n\n can then be derived from seismic moment according to \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\nw\n\n\n=\n2\n\/\n3\n\n(\nlog\n\n\nM\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n9\n.\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n(Ref.\u00a051). The stress drop related to the simple rupture area geometries of a circle and a rectangle are given by \n\n(4)\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03c4\n=\nM\n0\n\/\n\n(\nC\n\nA\n\nW\n)\n\n\n\n\nwith C \n=\n 16\n\n\u03c0\n\/\n7\n\n for the circular area and C \n=\n 3\n\n\u03c0\n\/\n8\n\n for the rectangular area, respectively.\n52\n W is the downdip width of the rupture and A the rupture area with A \n\n=\n\u03c0\n\n(W\/2)2 for the circular area and A \n=\n LW for the rectangular area where for the length of the rupture \n\nL\n=\n300\n\n or 1000\u00a0m is assumed.\nRegarding the production time and the pore pressure drop in the reservoir at which the stresses from the poroelastic model are transferred to the dynamic model the following approach was pursued. Given the different production periods after which SSR values of >0.6 are reached on each side of the fault and in view of the issue of whether this value should be reached on just one or on both sides of the fault (e.g.\u00a0Fig.\u00a03), the effective stress from the poroelastic model was transferred to the dynamic model after each pore pressure drop (every two years or every 2 MPa of pore pressure decrease, respectively) to examine at which production time the rupture actually initiates. Not in every case the rupture initiates at the time at which the SSR parameter exceeds the value of 0.6 for the first time and more depletion is required until the rupture occurs, depending on local stress conditions and friction. In the reference model SSR \n=\n 0.6 is reached after 14\u00a0years of production in the footwall block, which corresponds to 28 MPa of pore pressure decrease (Fig.\u00a03). However, the fault section experiencing this critical value is too small for the rupture to commence. After 18\u00a0years of production the fault section with SSR>0.6 has become large enough for the rupture to nucleate. In case of the reference model a critical fault section of \n\u223c\n6.5\u00a0m length is required for rupture initiation. Regarding the initiation of the rupture in the dynamic model, there is a small amount of overstress on the fault which arises from the discrete pore pressure steps during depletion in the poroelastic model. This overstress fulfils the conditions for the onset of slip on the contact surface. Transfer of stress from the poroelastic to the dynamic model after subsequent steps of pressure decrease shows that this overstress has negligible effect on the size of resulting ruptures.\n\n5.1\nReference model and production configurations\nThe temporal evolution of coseismic displacement on the fault is shown in Fig.\u00a07 for the reference model with production from the hanging wall only (Fig.\u00a07a) and for production from both compartments (Fig.\u00a07b). For production from the footwall block only no rupture occurs after 22\u00a0years of production. Numerical simulation results are presented in terms of the fault-parallel displacement on the fault for various time increments after the rupture initiated.\nBoth cases presented in Fig.\u00a07 show common characteristics. The rupture initiates at the top of the reservoir in the hanging wall block. The rupture propagates faster and more far to the downside than upward. The rupture arrests earlier at the lower end of the rupture than at its upper termination. The maximum displacement is reached 20\u201330\u00a0m below the hypocentre, which is in the middle of the section at which the two reservoirs are in contact. The upper termination of the rupture is near the top of the reservoir in the footwall block but not extending above it. The lower termination is 20\u201330\u00a0m above the base of the reservoir in the hanging wall, thus below the reservoir in the footwall block.\nWhile in both cases SSR\n=\n0.6 is reached after 14\u00a0years of production (Fig.\u00a04), this is not yet enough for rupture initiation in either case. For production from both compartments rupture initiation occurs after 16\u00a0years of production (Fig.\u00a07b), whereas with production from the hanging wall only two more years of production are required (Fig.\u00a07a). Despite the shorter production period in the former case, maximum displacement and rupture width are greater than if production is only from the hanging wall.\n\n\n\nTo elucidate the rupture further Fig.\u00a08 shows the shear and normal stress in the reference model. Maximum shear stress at rupture initiation is near 4800\u00a0m depth, which is also the depth of the maximum SSR value after 18\u00a0years of production (Fig.\u00a03a) and of the hypocentre (Fig.\u00a07a). Most of the stress drop occurs in the depth interval of the upper half of the reservoir in the hanging wall (4800\u20134850\u00a0m depth), where normal stress has its minimum values in the hanging wall (Fig.\u00a08b). In this depth interval shear stress after the rupture is smaller than before production, whereas above and below shear stress after rupture remains higher than prior to production (Fig.\u00a08a). Maximum stress drop is 29.13 MPa and average stress drop over the rupture plane is 7.46 MPa. At the upper and lower termination of the rupture there is a small section of the fault where shear stress after the rupture is larger than before rupture initiation (Fig.\u00a08a). The peak of negative shear stress values at the interface of the reservoir and the underburden in the hanging wall (4900\u00a0m) is reduced during the rupture although no displacement occurs there.\nFocal parameters of the normal faulting earthquake are listed in Table\u00a02. For the reference model maximum slip is 6.4\u00a0cm and average slip is 3.6\u00a0cm compared to 8.9\u00a0cm and 5.2\u00a0cm for production from both compartments, respectively. Rupture width reaches 108 and 127\u00a0m, respectively, resulting in a moment magnitude of between 1.96 and 2.67 and between 2.16 and 2.83, respectively, depending on whether the rupture area is assumed as circular or rectangular with a length of 1000\u00a0m. The calculated stress drop after Eq.\u00a0(4) is 0.95 and 1.17 MPa, respectively, for a rectangular rupture plane. For a circular rupture plane stress drop is higher by 64% (1.56 vs. 1.92 MPa).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2\nFault offset\nThe distribution of coseismic displacement along the fault for different offsets at the fault are shown in Fig.\u00a09, again for production from the hanging wall only. For zero offset no rupture occurs after 22\u00a0years of depletion. For 25, 75 and 100\u00a0m offset the hypocentre is at the same depth of \n\u223c\n4800 at the top of the reservoir in the hanging wall, which was also found for 50\u00a0m offset (Fig.\u00a07a). Rupture lengths and displacements differ considerably among these cases. Rupture length decreases with increasing offset, for 25\u00a0m offset it is twice as long as for 100\u00a0m offset and rupture lasts longer (Fig.\u00a09, Table\u00a02). For 25\u00a0m offset rupture propagates primarily down-dip whereas for 75 and 100\u00a0m offset rupture extends nearly symmetric upward and downward. Maximum displacement for 75\u00a0m offset is larger by nearly 150% than for 25\u00a0m offset and more than six fold the maximum displacement for 100\u00a0m offset. Rupture initiates first when offset equals the reservoir thickness (100\u00a0m) and increasingly later for smaller offsets (Fig.\u00a09, Table\u00a02). However, the reference model with 50\u00a0m offset produces the largest rupture width, displacement, magnitude and stress drop among the considered offsets (Figs. 7a, 9, Table\u00a02).\n\n\n5.3\nFault friction\nThe influence of fault friction on the rupture is investigated through a parameter study in which the static and dynamic coefficient of friction as well as the d parameter governing the transition between the two coefficients depending on slip velocity is varied with respect to the reference model. Fig.\u00a010 shows the various frictional parameters studied. The corresponding coseismic displacements for the different friction values are shown in Fig.\u00a011. Table\u00a03 provides an overview on the tested parameter combinations and results in comparison to the reference model.\n\n\n\nThe d parameter shows a significant influence on resulting earthquakes. Changing the d parameter to extreme values of 0.2 and 5.0 results in average slip which is 17% lower and 39% larger, respectively, than for the reference model (Figs. 7a; 11a,c; Table\u00a03). Rupture width is reduced by 23% and increased by 32%, respectively, w.r.t. the reference model. Assuming a rectangular rupture plane, the stress drop becomes larger for \n\nd\n=\n0\n.\n2\n\n than for \n\nd\n=\n5\n.\n0\n\n, although the released seismic moment is larger for the latter case (Table\u00a03). A higher d parameter leads to earlier reactivation of the fault than a lower one (Fig.\u00a011a\u2013c). In contrast to all other model variants for d\n=\n5 the rupture nucleates some 50\u00a0m deeper at the base of the reservoir in the footwall block and primarily propagates in the up-dip direction (Fig.\u00a011c). The case d\n=\n1 shows two ruptures starting shortly after one another at these two positions, which is also the case for \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n5\n\n\n (Fig.\u00a011b,d).\nA reduced coefficient of static friction of \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n5\n\n leads to earlier fault reactivation than the reference model (10 vs. 18\u00a0years of production). Rupture width, displacement and released seismic moment is larger than for the reference model with \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n6\n\n\n (Table\u00a03). In turn, increasing the static coefficient of friction to \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n65\n\n does not yield a rupture within the considered total production period. The dynamic coefficient of friction shows a very strong impact on displacement. Unchanged static and larger dynamic coefficient of friction result in 81% lower average slip and only 1\/3 of the stress drop of the reference model (Fig.\u00a07a, 11e; Table\u00a03). Contrarily, a dynamic coefficient of friction of \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n2\n\n produces the highest maximum and average displacement, rupture width, magnitude and stress drop of all cases considered (Fig.\u00a011f, Table\u00a03).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4\nStress state prior to production\n\nFig.\u00a012 shows the coseismic displacement for models with different prestress states before production commences and Table\u00a04 shows the corresponding focal parameters. Fig.\u00a012a and b show the result for less compressive prestress states with only 2 and 3\u00a0m of horizontal shortening on each side of the model compared to 4\u00a0m in the reference model (\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n58\n\n and 0.60, respectively, compared to \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n66\n\n in the reference model). The rupture initiates earlier after 4 and 12\u00a0years of production, respectively, compared to 18\u00a0years in the reference model. Despite of this, maximum displacement is larger by 175% for half the amount of shortening and still larger by 66% for \n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n of the amount of shortening relative to the reference model (Table\u00a04; Fig.\u00a012a and b compared to the reference model Fig.\u00a07a, respectively). Likewise, average displacement is 9.56 and 4.92\u00a0cm for the two cases, compared to 3.60\u00a0cm in the reference model. Rupture width is 243 and 194\u00a0m which is also significantly larger than for the reference model (108\u00a0m). While for the reference model rupture does not reach the top of the reservoir in the footwall (Fig.\u00a07a), rupture extends increasingly further into the overburden with less compressive prestress, roughly 100\u00a0m in Fig.\u00a012a which is equal to the reservoir thickness. This results in a higher magnitude of up to 3.2 assuming a 1000\u00a0m long rupture plane, which is the largest one obtained among all model variants. Stress drop, however, is not the largest in this case. The case with 3\u00a0m of shortening shows a significantly lower stress drop than the cases with 2 and 4\u00a0m of shortening (Table\u00a04).\nWhile for 3\u00a0m of shortening rupture initiates at the top of the reservoir in the hanging wall (Fig.\u00a012b) as for the reference model, for 2\u00a0m of shortening the rupture initiates at the bottom of the reservoir in the footwall and propagates predominantly upward (Fig.\u00a012a). For higher horizontal prestress (6\u00a0m of shortening) no normal faulting earthquake occurs at the end of production but a tiny reverse faulting event at the base of the reservoir in the hanging wall (Fig.\u00a012c). If the Poisson\u2019s effect used in the prestressing procedure is performed with a lower Poisson\u2019s ratio of \n\n\u03bd\n=\n0\n.\n15\n\n the amount of shortening required to obtain an appropriate \n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n value is larger. Resulting normal faulting ruptures do not reach the base of the reservoir in the hanging wall but right there also small reverse faulting earthquakes occur (Fig.\u00a012d,e). Again the higher the applied amount of horizontal shortening the later the rupture initiates and the smaller is the resulting normal faulting earthquake. The largest stress drop among all model variants is found for the heterogeneous prestress obtained with \n\n\u03bd\n=\n0\n.\n15\n\n and 8\u00a0m push in the prestressing procedure although several model variants show significantly higher displacement and magnitude (Fig.\u00a012e, Table\u00a04). The less heterogeneous prestress obtained with a higher Poisson\u2019s ratio in the prestressing procedure (Fig.\u00a06f) does not produce a rupture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nDiscussion of results\nThe pore pressure depletion during production leads to an increase in effective vertical stress which in turn leads to reservoir compaction. As a consequence shear stress on the fault increases, also above the producing reservoir section (Fig.\u00a03b). Changes in shear stress are positive (i.e.\u00a0towards normal faulting) above the producing reservoir due to subsidence and negative (i.e.\u00a0towards reverse faulting) below the producing reservoir because there is a slight uplift of the basement due to the vertical shrinkage of the reservoir (Fig.\u00a03b). Effective normal stress increases in the producing reservoir interval on the hanging wall side of the fault, whereas it decreases on the footwall side. This is associated with horizontal shrinkage of the producing reservoir which lowers horizontal stresses in the adjacent footwall block\n8\n\n,\n\n10\n (Fig.\u00a03c). Since the shear stress is basically the same on both sides of the fault, the difference in the SSR values between hanging wall and footwall comes from the differing pore pressures and effective normal stresses on either side of the fault (Fig.\u00a03). In the overlapping depth interval SSR values hardly change with production on the hanging wall side because the increase in shear stress and the increase in normal stress nearly cancel out each other. On the footwall side however, shear stress increase is accompanied by reduction in effective normal stress, which leads to a significant increase of the SSR value (Fig.\u00a03). This explains why temporal changes of the SSR parameter are larger in the sideburden not under production than in the producing reservoir section (Figs.\u00a03 and 4).\nA common characteristic of the modelled dynamic ruptures is that coseismic displacements are primarily in a normal faulting sense as expected for production-induced earthquakes,\n4\n and which is in agreement with observations from North German gas fields e.g. Refs.\u00a016, 21. Deformation associated with pore pressure decrease, particularly shear stress increase because of reservoir compaction and reduction of effective normal stress on the adjacent side of the producing reservoir facilitates fault reactivation.\nA further characteristic of all model variants is that the rupture extends over the depth interval in which the two reservoirs are juxtaposed (Figs. 7, 9, 11, 12). In some cases, the rupture extends towards the top of the reservoir in the footwall but it never reaches the lowermost section of the reservoir in the hanging wall block, except for the case with very low \n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n ratio (Fig.\u00a012a). The hypocentre, i.e.,\u00a0the depth at which the rupture nucleates, corresponds to the depth of a positive peak in the SSR value (Figs.\u00a03\u20136). If above and below that depth the SSR value decreases with a strong gradient so does the coseismic displacement. The rupture extends into adjacent sections of the fault which are conditionally stable, i.e.,\u00a0where SSR values are lower than the static coefficient of friction. The termination of the rupture corresponds to the depth where the SSR value decreases below the value of the dynamic coefficient of friction, apart from local overshooting. Although SSR values in the overburden are only little below the dynamic coefficient of friction, the peak of small or negative SSR values at the top of the reservoir in the footwall block prevent ruptures from extending to shallower depths (Figs.\u00a03\u20137, 9, 11). For the same reason the negative peak in the SSR at the base of the reservoir in the hanging wall block which also extends into the lowermost section of the reservoir prevents ruptures from propagating further down-dip into the underburden. Both factors are favourable with respect to seismic hazard but it cannot be excluded that other model configurations exist where ruptures may reactivate deeper fault sections in the crust e.g.\u00a0with a less stiff underburden and lower k ratios in the underburden. Up-dip extension beyond the top of the reservoir was found for low \n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n ratios (Fig.\u00a012a,b).\nThe configuration of production affects the temporal changes of the SSR parameter in the over- and underburden in different ways and this is where operational measures come into play. For production from the hanging wall only the SSR value increases in the overburden and decreases in the underburden (Fig.\u00a03), which holds for all offsets considered (Fig.\u00a05). For production from the footwall block only it is vice versa (Fig.\u00a04b) and for production from both blocks the SSR value decreases both in the over- and underburden (Fig.\u00a04a). The changes of the SSR value in the over- and underburden are rather small but nevertheless they may matter depending on the prestress conditions. Regarding potential extension of ruptures to the upside the creep behaviour of evaporates which are occasionally present in the overburden could reduce shear stress during production and thereby represent an additional safety factor.\nThe parameter study on different offsets shows that the one with half the reservoir thickness produces by far the largest rupture in terms of magnitude, rupture length and stress drop (Figs. 7a and 9; Table\u00a02). Other modelling studies show a variable pattern regarding the relationship between earthquake size and fault throw. The zero-offset case produced larger displacements and rupture length than the case with offset equal to half the reservoir thickness,\n27\n\n,\n\n34\n whereas other studies show displacements and rupture length growing steadily with fault throw reaching a maximum close to an offset equal to the reservoir thickness.\n7\n\n,\n\n53\n If not maximum displacement but integrated displacement on the rupture plane is regarded there are examples in which a maximum is reached for fault throws equalling half the reservoir thickness,\n7\n comparable to the result of the recent study. This indicates that model parameters and assumptions such as rock parameters, pre-production stresses, geometry, frictional properties in which the mentioned studies differ from each other obviously do play a vital role in this.\nThe case with offset equal to the reservoir thickness shows the earliest reactivation but smallest rupture length, whereas ruptures are postponed for smaller offsets but reach larger rupture lengths (Fig.\u00a09). In contrast to rupture size, the relation between timing of rupture initiation and fault throw is coherent among different modelling studies. The amount of depletion necessary for fault reactivation is smallest for fault throws in the order of the reservoir thickness and becomes larger with decreasing fault throw,\n34\n\n,\n\n53\n supporting this result. In agreement with this Orlic & Wassing\n8\n concluded that fault reactivation occurs earlier for fault throws of between 0.5 and 1.5 times the reservoir thickness than for smaller fault throws since the stress changes from both producing compartments overlap. Stress drop for 75\u00a0m offset is similar as for 50\u00a0m offset and about three times as large as for 25 and 100\u00a0m offset (Table\u00a02). It is known that the high-frequency ground motion (e.g.,\u00a0peak ground acceleration or peak ground velocity) is controlled by the stress drop of an earthquake, thus, besides the higher magnitude for these cases, the higher stress drop will produce more intense ground motions.\n54\n\n,\n\n55\n In this respect the choice of 50\u00a0m offset for the reference model represents the most critical case with regard to seismic hazard among the considered cases.\nFrom an operational point of view, it has been argued that production from both compartments separated by an intra-field fault is disadvantageous with respect to seismic hazard in comparison to production from one block only.\n7\n The results presented in Fig.\u00a07 support this view as the rupture with production from both compartments initiates earlier compared to if production is only from the hanging wall block and in spite of this produced a larger rupture length, displacement, magnitude and stress drop (Table\u00a02). However, this may not be a general rule and can depend on the specific material parameters, initial conditions and geometry as Zbinden et\u00a0al.\u00a0\n9\n found a smaller seismic moment of an induced earthquake in this case even though shear stress on the intra-field fault is higher if both of the adjacent reservoir compartments are depleted. Disregarding the numerous factors affecting fault reactivation, the latter essentially depends on an interplay of effective normal stress and shear stress. On the one hand effective normal stress on the fault reduces more rapidly if production is from both compartments adjacent to the fault due to lateral shrinkage of the adjacent reservoir sections, which reduces fault stability. On the other hand, shear stress increases slower if at all since differential compaction is smaller compared to if production is from only one compartment, provided that there is sufficient overlap of the reservoir at the fault.\nAn important point in this issue is the assumed pore pressure in the fault. In this study, pore pressure undergoes a step across the fault if production is only from one compartment as the fault is assumed to be impermeable and thus effective normal stress is different on both sides of the fault as production proceeds. If a continuous transition in pore pressure was assumed across the fault effective normal stress on the fault would represent an average value of the pore pressure in the two compartments. Regarding fault reactivation our approach is considered a conservative one as rupture initiation depends primarily on the SSR value on that side of the fault that reaches critical values first, as a comparison of Figs.\u00a03\u20136 with the timing of rupture initiation for the respective models shows.\nAmong the parameters investigated, the largest impact on how strong a production-induced earthquake will be, is found for the frictional parameters of the fault (Fig.\u00a011, Table\u00a03). By definition, higher static or lower dynamic coefficient of friction increases the coseismic stress drop. The case with \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n2\n\n produces a stress drop that is four times as large as for \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n3\n\n\n (Table\u00a03). However, the two cases of \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n6\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n5\n\n produce nearly the same stress drop and magnitude for \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n5\n\n is even larger than for \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n6\n\n\n (Table\u00a03). This can be explained by the fact that with the lower static coefficient of friction a larger section of the fault becomes critically stressed as the dynamic rupture propagates, resulting in a larger rupture width and larger displacement as for \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n6\n\n. A variable d parameter strongly affects the size of the resulting earthquake (Fig.\u00a011a\u2013c). For high d values friction is smaller at the same slip velocity (Fig.\u00a010), which may also represent a self-enhancing effect of the applied velocity weakening law. The different hypocentre depths for \n\nd\n=\n0\n.\n2\n\n and d=5 and the different directions of rupture propagation (primarily downward and upward, respectively) (Fig.\u00a011a and c) imply different directivity and radiation pattern of the wave field, which should affect near surface ground motion. The case d=1 shows that both of these hypocentre depths correspond to the depths which are most prone to reactivation in the initial stress (Figs.\u00a03 and 11b). In Fig.\u00a011b and d two ruptures nucleate which combine into one rupture. The lower hypocentre may be dynamically triggered by the upper one (p-wave velocity in the underburden is 4714\u00a0m\/s and distance between the two hypocentres is about 45\u00a0m) but apparently the fault is already critically stressed at these two depths.\nUnfortunately, frictional parameters of natural faults can hardly be assessed at depth, and add significant uncertainty to calculation of focal parameters. Additionally, frictional parameters are expected to vary along natural faults. Experimental data indicate significant differences in friction considering changes in lithology, facies, alteration, presence of clay minerals, temperature, variable fault maturity with depth or rupture mechanism, apart from a strong dependence on rupture velocity.\n42\n\n,\n\n56\u201359\n In particular, clay bearing faults are known to be characterized by both, low static and dynamic coefficients of friction, which according to the results shown in Fig.\u00a011d\u2013f\u200b would result in larger magnitudes than for the reference model. Exceptionally low dynamic coefficients of friction of 0.1 or lower of certain clay minerals found in cores of large faults e.g. Refs.\u00a060, 61 cannot be excluded here but due to low tectonic deformation rates in the region and much smaller total offset at the fault this is not expected. Under such conditions faults may exhibit a cohesion due to alteration and precipitation of minerals in the fault zone, which was not accounted for in the model. It can be expected that a non-zero cohesion would postpone reactivation of the fault, which would increase accumulated shear stress at the onset of rupturing but at the same time a smaller section of the fault may experience critical stresses, similar to the case with different static coefficients of friction (Figs.\u00a07 and 11d, Table\u00a03).\nIn all models maximum coseismic displacement occurs within the depth interval where the reservoirs overlap, in most cases below the depth of the maximum SSR value where the rupture nucleates (e.g.\u00a0Figs. 3a and 7). This can be explained by the fact that SSR values decrease at a smaller gradient below this depth of maximum SSR value than above where gradients are much steeper above the reservoir in the hanging wall (Fig.\u00a03a). Nucleation of the rupture is in all model variants at or near a lithological interface and in many cases this is also true for the arrest of the rupture (e.g.\u00a0Figs. 9a, 11b\u2013e, 12a,d). The high stiffness contrasts between the reservoir and the over- and underburden with a factor of 4 and 6.7 in the Young\u2019s modulus, respectively, causes stress peaks or asperities as can be seen in the prestress and further enhanced during production (Fig.\u00a03). Such asperities can affect the spatio-temporal evolution of coseismic slip. Coseismic displacement for the model shown in Fig.\u00a012b with reduced horizontal stress prior to production indicates a slow-down of rupture speed from the hypocentre to the depth of the top of the reservoir in the footwall (4750\u00a0m) but then there is a distinct acceleration and slip propagates faster upward before it finally arrests at 4696\u00a0m depth.\nThe model variants with variable prestress reflecting different tectonic stress conditions from the regional stress field, reveal that the production period upon rupture initiation, the depth of rupture initiation, the upper and lower terminations of the rupture, displacement, magnitude and stress drop depend strongly on this pre-production stress state. In general, earthquakes nucleate later, the higher the horizontal stress is and the less heterogeneous the stress is distributed across the lithological units and vice versa. With higher horizontal stress also coseismic displacement and magnitude decrease despite the longer production period. However, stress drop is not necessarily the largest for the largest magnitude but if displacement is concentrated over the rupture width. With increasing \n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n ratio and heterogeneity of the prestress there is a tendency for the occurrence of small reverse faulting ruptures at the base of the reservoir in the hanging wall. These general conclusions hold for the rock parameters applied in this study, which show significant stiffness contrasts between the lithological units. Such reverse faulting events in an extensional tectonic regime have been previously found in modelling studies and they were attributed to stiffness of the surrounding rock being larger than the stiffness of the reservoir rock and to differential pore pressure development due to reservoir compartmentalisation.\n7\n The negative SSR values below the reservoir responsible for such reverse faulting prevent production-induced normal faulting ruptures from extending into the basement. However, due to a lack of data the actual initial stress state in both the over- and underburden is not known. The anti-correlation of smaller earthquakes and longer production obtained for higher horizontal prestress indicates that a significant amount of released seismic energy comes from the tectonic prestress besides the stress build-up from the production.\n\n\n6.2\nImplications for additional earthquakes after an induced earthquake\nIn the following, we interpret our findings as to whether, in the case of continued production after an induced event, subsequent earthquakes besides aftershocks may occur in a gas field. We approach this issue from three different perspectives.\nFirst, the tectonic component in stress drop and plastic mechanisms during reservoir compaction. Ongoing production after an earthquake leads to further compaction of the reservoir and as a result shear stress resumes to accrue on the fault. While we do observe in our results that the SSR parameter increases with ongoing production (Fig.\u00a03) we also find, that seismic moment does not increase in a systematic way if an earthquake occurs after a longer period of production compared to if it occurs earlier, i.e.\u00a0after less pore pressure draw down (Figs. 7, 9, 11, 12). Other factors such as geometry, the configuration of productions wells, frictional properties and pre-production stress dominate in this respect. This indicates that a significant portion of the shear stresses released during the earthquake does not necessarily derive from production-related compaction but has been stored in the host rock from tectonic movements in the geological past. Fig.\u00a08a shows that coseismic stress drop in a wide portion of the rupture width is larger than the shear stress increase during production. Although this tectonic component of stress drop likely becomes smaller if the prestress were chosen more uniform, this finding is supported by the observation that particularly in the deeper subsurface of the North German Basin there is a tendency for normal faulting tectonics.\n45\n This indicates that the induced earthquakes relief in part tectonically induced strain energy, but the trigger to release those stresses is the pore pressure reduction due to production. If this is the case, there is no real argument against prolonged production after an induced event in which tectonic stresses have been reduced. The portion of tectonic stresses of total stresses released during a potential future earthquake is then likely smaller than in the previous event. This is particularly expectable in areas of very low tectonic deformation rates such as the North German Basin. However, in seismically active producing gas fields it has been observed that once compaction exceeds a certain critical level, seismicity increases significantly irrespective of operational measures to reduce seismicity such as production rate cuts, total production volume cuts and field shutdown.\n29\n Pore pressure reduction and associated increase of effective stress leads to porosity decrease which accelerates, once confining stress exceeds the stress during consolidation of the sediment.\n62\n Plastic deformation mechanisms\n43\n\n,\n\n44\n\n,\n\n63\n such as pore collapse have been evoked to explain this phenomenon, which is not accounted for in our model as we do not consider plastic rock behaviour. The permeability decrease associated with the porosity decrease requires an increasing pore pressure gradient to achieve economic flow rates which can additionally weaken the rock.\n64\n\n\nSecond, we compare stress drop of modelled earthquakes with the shear strength of the crust which can be regarded as the maximum possible stress drop. Knowing the theoretically still possible stress drop after an earthquake has occurred, allows for a worst case estimate. Assuming the Mohr\u2013Coulomb criterion, an internal coefficient of friction of 0.6 and a normal faulting tectonic regime (\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n1\n\n\n=\n\n\nS\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n), the shear strength of the crust is \n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\ncrit\n\n\n=\n0\n\n.34(\n\n\nS\n\n\nV\n\n\n-P) (Ref.\u00a065). At mid-reservoir level in the reservoir and sideburden we find an average effective vertical stress of 75.3 MPa, which corresponds to a shear strength of the crust of 25.5 MPa. Assuming a rectangular rupture area, the calculated stress drop from the reference model after Eq.\u00a0(4) corresponds to 3.7% of the shear strength of the crust and the stress drops from the model variants are in the range of 1.1\u20135.2%. Stress drops of most induced earthquakes in the US have been found in the range 5%\u201350% of the shear strength of the crust with an average of 15%\u201320% (Ref.\u00a065). However, most of these earthquakes were injection-induced ones, had higher magnitudes and were strike-slip or thrust faulting mechanisms which tend to produce higher stress drops than normal faulting earthquakes.\nIf we take the stress drop from the reference model determined from the difference between the pre- and post-rupture shear stress in Fig.\u00a08a, which is 7.46 MPa on average on the rupture plane and derive the maximum shear stress \n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nmax\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n from the normal stress given in Fig.\u00a08b, which is about 60 MPa, we receive 36 MPa for \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nmax\n\n\n using \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n6\n\n. The modelled stress drop therefore amounts to 20.7% of \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nmax\n\n\n. which is in the range of observed stress drops referred to above. To conclude, from this point of view additional earthquakes after an occurred one are possible. However, the modelled stress drops in relation to observed ones also suggest that tectonic stresses may be largely released during a first event and that total stress drops in the order of the strength of the rock are not expectable.\nThird, coseismic stress changes can increase shear stress or Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) on sections of the fault ahead the rupture plane or in its surrounding which is known as a mechanism that facilitates subsequent earthquakes.\n66\n\nFig.\u00a013 shows the change of Coulomb Failure stress for the reference model on planes parallel to the fault. While in Tables\u00a02 and 3 the stress drop was calculated based on coseismic slip and rupture dimensions, the actual stress drop is highly heterogeneous along the fault, which is shown in Fig.\u00a08a. Shear stress decreases on the rupture plane indicated by the blue patch in the overlapping part of the reservoir and slightly increases above and below the rupture, which facilitates instability there. This is also seen in the shear stress after rupture exceeding the shear stress before rupture initiation near the tips of the rupture plane (Fig.\u00a08a).\n\nThe obtained heterogeneous stress drop despite the plane fault geometry and the uniform distribution of frictional parameters emphasizes the importance of asperities in the rupture process. In the model such asperities arise from the transitions in lithology, the inhomogeneous distribution of initial stress and the slip rate dependent coefficient of friction. In the presented models hypocentres occur near interfaces between different lithologies, where SSR value and pre-rupture shear stress reach their maximum values and right at the interface the maximum stress drop is found (Fig.\u00a08a). In agreement with this, areas of high stress drop within heterogeneous distributions of stress drop in fault zones have been found to correlate with high slip areas and the proximity of rocks with high stiffness.\n67\n\n\n\n\n6.3\nSize of earthquakes and seismic hazard\nThe magnitudes of the modelled earthquakes are in the same order as the ones observed thus far in North German gas fields. The BVEG (Bundesverband Erd\u00f6l, Erdgas und Geoenergie e.V.) catalogue\n17\n thus far includes seven earthquakes with \n\n\n\nM\n\n\nL\n\n\n=\n3\n.\n0\n\n or larger since 2012, the strongest one reaching \n\n\n\nM\n\n\nL\n\n\n=\n3\n.\n6\n\n. The strongest earthquake in the field the presented model is based on reached a magnitude of 3.1. The reference model produces a magnitude of 2.7 assuming a 1000\u00a0m long rectangular fault (Table\u00a02). Considering the case that a known major fault of 4.6 km length in this field ruptures during a single event over its whole extent would imply a magnitude of \n\n\n\nM\n\n\nw\n\n\n=\n3\n.\n1\n\n for the parameters used in the reference model, thus equal to the largest magnitude recorded thus far. This magnitude is less than an independently estimated maximum magnitude of M\n=\n3.5 for this field according to the approach outlined in \u00a0Ref.\u00a068, which represents the legal guideline for the operation of gas fields in The Netherlands. This indicates that more unfavourable assumptions for the reference model, e.g.\u00a0lower coefficients of friction or lower pre-production horizontal stress, are possible or that the semi-generic character of the model does not fully capture the relevant physics or complexities of the field.\nFrom a general perspective the size of modelled earthquakes can be regarded as upper bounds. In the calculations of seismic moment it is assumed that displacement does not change along strike of the fault, thus out of the model plane, but actually displacement vanishes at the lateral edges of the ruptured section of the fault and thus magnitude is overestimated. Aseismic creep can contribute to the release of shear stress that has accrued during production.\n69\n Not necessarily all of the stored elastic strain needs to be released through seismic waves as off-fault plasticity can take up strain through inelastic deformation as well. The shear stress could be also released by a number of smaller earthquakes instead of one larger one, which would be more likely with a non-planar fault. Given not just one but several parallel faults exist, slip partitioning over these faults could reduce slip on a single one.\nRegarding the changes of the SSR parameter with pore pressure decrease during production it is known that the Poisson\u2019s ratio plays a vital role as it determines the relative changes of effective horizontal and vertical stress and thus the angle between stress path and failure line. Other studies found that stress path becomes steeper for lower Poisson\u2019s ratios.\n9\n\n,\n\n53\n As the Poisson\u2019s ratio used in this study is already relatively low in the reservoir (\n\n\u03bd\n=\n0\n.\n17\n\n), we consider our results as conservative with respect to seismic hazard as far as this parameter is concerned since later fault reactivation may be expected for higher values of the Poisson\u2019s ratio.\nIn comparison to the gas fields in The Netherlands there are several factors suggesting that seismic hazard could be lower for the gas fields in Northern Germany. (1) The German gas fields are at much greater depths than the Dutch fields which implies higher normal stress on the faults which in turn hampers fault reactivation although this is compensated to some extent by larger shear stress, which generally increases also with depth. However, ground motions at the surface should be smaller if the hypocentre is at larger depth due to attenuation and geometric spreading of the wave field. Accordingly, ground motion recordings from earthquakes in Northern Germany tend to be lower than those predicted by empirical ground motion equations based on data from the Groningen field for comparable earthquake magnitudes and epicentral distance.\n18\n\n,\n\n21\u201323\n\n,\n\n70\n (2) Gas fields in The Netherlands have in general much thicker reservoirs than those in Northern Germany and high porosities which in general implies larger compaction, which is a major factor for fault reactivation. (3) In contrast to the Dutch gas fields, German gas fields have in many cases not many neighbouring compartments under production which can postpone fault reactivation and reduce rupture size (Fig.\u00a07).\n\n\n6.4\nDiscussion of model assumptions and limitations\nIn this section we summarize the main limitations of the model and what could be improved. The usage of two different models for production and rupture modelling puts some constraints on the precision on rupture initiation as time steps in the poroelastic model correspond to steps of 4 MPa pore pressure decrease. This ultimately leads to a certain amount of overstress at the beginning of the rupture. However, model runs of ruptures with consecutive steps of pore pressure decrease as initial stress showed only small changes of a few percent in the resulting coseismic displacement and do not change the presented basic findings. Time steps in the poroelastic model could be decreased but a better way would be the usage of one model in which implicit computation is automatically switched to explicit once the state of stress reaches a defined criterion.\n34\n\n\nMore advanced modelling approaches could include specific fault-related aspects like potential plastic deformation nearby the fault due to local stress peaks evolving during the dynamic rupture,\n71\n rock strengthening and weakening effects due to pore pressure decrease and increase in the dilated and compressed areas during rupture\n72\n as well as pore pressure diffusion and poroelastic relaxation subsequent to the earthquake\n73\n\n,\n\n74\n which were not the scope of this analysis. It has been shown that the fluid effect on dynamic rupture can be substantial as the style of coseismic rupture and the wavefield can be altered including higher rupture speed and stronger amplitudes of the waves compared to if the fluid effect on dynamic rupture is neglected.\n75\n Analyses of dynamic rupture considering plastic off-fault yielding showed that coseismic slip rates become smaller, ground motions are less variable and slip is locally higher but concentrated on a smaller area compared to if rock is assumed as elastic.\n76\n As a result, moment magnitudes are comparable with and without plasticity.\n76\n Rupture transfer across geometrical barriers is hampered when off-fault plasticity is assumed.\nIn the model it is assumed that the fault is truly impermeable since pressure data from the gas fields under consideration indicate this. This implies that effective stresses on the reservoir side of the fault are determined by the pore pressure in the reservoir and on the adjacent side of the fault by the pore pressure encountered there, i.e.\u00a0a step in both pore pressure and effective stress is present at the fault plane. In a more general analysis the fault would need to be assumed as a zone rather than a plane and be characterized by a permeability which would determine how the pore pressure changes through the fault zone depending on how fast the pressure decreases during production on the reservoir side of the fault. At a high fault permeability a gradual or even linear change of pore pressure would develop through the fault zone which would alter the effective stresses transferred to the dynamic model.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nModelling of dynamic rupture of depletion induced earthquakes in an intra-graben setting typical for North German gas fields yields several key characteristics. We find normal faulting rupture on the fault in the depth interval of the reservoir where there is partial overlap of the reservoir in the adjacent compartment. Displacement does not reach the lowermost \n\u223c\n20 metres of the reservoir in the hanging wall except for low horizontal stresses prior to production and only occasionally reaches the top of the reservoir in the footwall or slightly above. The rupture propagates into fault sections not critically stressed prior to the onset of rupture. Rupture nucleates near the top of the reservoir in the hanging wall where the largest SSR values have accrued. The rupture propagates in most cases to the downside where also the maximum displacement occurs. Down-dip width of the rupture, magnitude, maximum displacement as well as stress drop are larger for a reservoir offset at the fault equal to half its thickness compared to if reservoir offset is smaller or larger. However, the fault is reactivated earlier if offset is large. Production from both compartments results in earlier and larger earthquakes than if only the compartment on one side of the fault is under production. Among the parameters investigated, frictional properties on the fault and pre-production stress have the strongest impact on coseismic displacements. Particularly the stress state prior to production reflecting the tectonic stress field plays a crucial role as it primarily controls how long production can occur or how much pore pressure decrease can be sustained until a critical state of stress is reached. The pre-production stress is not only characterized by its ratio of effective horizontal to vertical stress (\n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n) that has a major influence on fault normal stress but also stiffness contrasts between lithologies affect the stress state which subsequently can be important for nucleation and\/or arrest of a rupture. Thus, the earthquakes represent an interplay of tectonic stresses and depletion induced stress changes that both drive the earthquake but pore pressure draw down during production advances the time of earthquake occurrence, which is especially true for areas of low-deformation rates such as Northern Germany.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nT.

The Swiss concept for disposal of spent fuel\/vitrified high-level waste (e.g.,\u00a0as defined in Ref.\u00a01) is based on horizontally emplacing cylindrical disposal canisters in the middle of an emplacement drift excavated in the Opalinus Clay. The canisters are placed on pedestals of highly compacted bentonite blocks. The remaining void space between the canisters and tunnel wall is filled with granulated bentonite mixture (GBM). The most important safety function of the bentonite is to protect the integrity of the canister for at least one thousand years.\n2\n\n\nBentonite is a clay material consisting mostly of montmorillonite. Bentonite-based buffer materials of the EBS will saturate over time with groundwater from the host rock. This results in a swelling pressure, a decrease in hydraulic conductivity and an increase in thermal conductivity (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a03). Aside from stabilizing the canisters, the bentonite buffer provides the safety functions of containment (e.g.,\u00a0by limiting advective transport and reducing microbial activity) and retardation (e.g.,\u00a0by filtering colloids and sorbing radionuclides), thereby fulfilling long-term safety requirements, which are specified, e.g.,\u00a0in the \u201cLong-term Performance of Engineered Barrier Systems\u201d (PEBS) project.\n4\n\n\nBentonite blocks and GBM are engineered to fulfill key safety requirements (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a05). Typical engineering parameters are water content, grain size and dry density (DD). Besides the long-term aspects of bentonite performance, the emplacement techniques also must be considered. During emplacement of the GBM, overall grain size distribution and water content can be controlled to retain the original production properties. Therefore, DD is the crucial parameter for GBM emplacement. In addition, DD after emplacement controls the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical properties of the bentonite (e.g.,\u00a0Refs.\u00a06, 7). In the Swiss concept, screw feeders will be used to convey the GBM and fill the spaces around the canisters. The required DD of the GBM after emplacement is currently aimed to be a minimum of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3 (e.g., Refs.\u00a08, 9).\nThe emplacement of GBM using screw feeders was tested and optimized in several mock-up experiments as well as in large-scale underground experiments in the Mont Terri rock laboratory in Switzerland.\n9\n The mock-up experiments carried out within the framework of the EU project \u201cEngineering Studies and Demonstration of Repository Designs\u201d (ESDRED) showed that the overall GBM DD of >1,450\u00a0kg\/m3 can be reliably achieved using screw feeders.\n10\n\n\nMoreover, the in-situ experiments in the Mont Terri rock laboratory, namely the Engineered Barrier (EB) experiment under isothermal conditions (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a011) and the HE-E experiment on the behavior of the engineered barriers under the influence of heat (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a012), showed that the average DDs of 1,360\u00a0kg\/m3 (in a horseshoe-shaped tunnel section 2.9 m wide, 2.65 m high, 6 m long) and 1,457\u00a0kg\/m3 (in a circular tunnel section 1.3\u00a0m in diameter and 4 m long), respectively, could be achieved using screw feeders under repository-like underground conditions. In both experiments, only the average DDs were determined by means of mass-balance methods. Any potential spatial variation in the initial DD was not measured due to the different aims of these experiments and the lack of measurement techniques that could reliably resolve heterogeneities in the GBM after emplacement.\nSome attempts were made to capture variations in the DD. Sampling methods were employed in some mock-up tests of the EB experiment (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a011) and the HE-E experiment (e.g., Ref.\u00a012). The results revealed low DD spots, e.g.,\u00a0at locations where the GBM flow was obstructed or a significant segregation of the granulated material occurred. It should be noted that destructive sampling is not always possible and could only be performed in those mock-up tests where the emplaced GBM could be accessed. The gamma\u2013gamma method and a penetrometer were also employed in the Full-scale Seal (FSS) experiment performed by Andra in France.\n13\n These two methods captured qualitative changes in the DD, but it was concluded that further development was needed. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) was also tested in the FSS experiment to monitor the DD along the side and end walls of the full-scale mock-up concrete vault for intermediate-level waste (ILW), and changes in the DD due to segregation and local voids were detected. Observation windows used in the mock-up tests were helpful to visually confirm segregation \n12\n\n,\n\n13\n and local voids.\n13\n\n\nThe lack of measurement techniques for investigating spatial variations in the GBM after emplacement was addressed in the recent Full-scale Emplacement (FE) experiment in the Mont Terri rock laboratory.\n14\n The FE experiment consists of three full-sized dummy disposal canisters with electrical heating systems emplaced in a horizontal tunnel with an inside diameter of approximately 3\u00a0m and a length of 50\u00a0m. The primary aim of the FE experiment is to investigate the thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupled effects on the host rock. Additional aims, from an engineering perspective, were to demonstrate the technical feasibility of constructing a disposal tunnel, to optimize the production of bentonite buffer material, and to validate the on-site bentonite buffer emplacement procedures (e.g., Refs.\u00a08, 15). The FE experiment was densely instrumented with conventional sensors, prototype sensors and fiber-optic (FO) sensors. The FO sensors were used for various measurements in the FE tunnel such as the longitudinal spatial DD variations of the GBM at the time of emplacement as described later in this study, as well as spatial and temporal changes in the temperature, strain and water content (not discussed in this study).\nTo emplace the GBM in the FE tunnel as densely and homogeneously as possible, a prototype backfilling machine (BFM) consisting of five screw feeders was constructed. The required minimum DD of the bulk GBM as emplaced was 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3. A 1:1-scale mock-up backfilling test was performed prior to the actual backfilling of the FE tunnel to investigate how the new prototype BFM would perform, to ensure that the required DD was achieved, and to optimize the backfilling procedure. The mock-up test was densely instrumented with dielectric sensors to capture variations in the DD of the GBM over the tunnel cross-section.\nTo ensure the performance of the bentonite buffer, the minimum target DD set as the key parameter (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a016) was tracked by the bulk values averaged over the backfilled volume. This was, however, based on an ideal assumption that any heterogeneity in the buffer would eventually decrease and reach the average DD after a sufficiently long saturation period \n17\n and that the radiogenic heat from the canisters would decay. Regarding the DD variation in the buffer, information on saturation will generally be limited to the duration of the experiment and will become available only by dismantling the in-situ experiments. In the EB experiment, where a dummy canister was placed on highly compacted bentonite blocks (initial DD \n=\n 1,690\u00a0kg\/m3, water content \n=\n 14.4%) and covered by GBM (average DD \n=\n 1,360\u00a0kg\/m3, water content \n=\n 4.2%), the initially large difference in the DD between the blocks and the GBM was homogenized over a ten-year period using artificial hydration (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a018) under isothermal conditions. In contrast, in the FEBEX experiment conducted at the Grimsel Test Site in Switzerland under non-isothermal and natural saturation conditions over an 18-year period, hydraulic and thermal regimes induced a significant development in the DD gradient even though the bentonite near the heater had not yet reached full saturation at the time of dismantling (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a019).\nAs noted above, however, very little information is available on the variation in the DD of GBM at the time of emplacement. To the authors\u2019 best knowledge, this is largely due to the lack of measurement methods. The heterogeneity at the time of emplacement, which depends on the types of materials and emplacement methods used, would provide a better understanding of the temporal evolution. Some of the heterogeneity, induced either at the time of emplacement or through hydraulic and thermal regimes, could persist for a long time period.\n20\n\n\nIn the present study, an attempt was made to quantify the DD distribution in the GBM at the time of emplacement by screw feeders in large-scale setups. The full-scale mock-up test in which cross-sectional variations were quantified is described first, followed by a description of the in-situ FE tunnel backfilling including the longitudinal variation of the DD.\n\n\n2\nGranulated bentonite mixture and backfilling machine\nThe GBM used for the mock-up and in-situ backfilling tests is referred to as Mixture 3.\n8\n The raw sodium bentonite material mined in Wyoming, USA, was first compressed to pellets with a DD of 2,180\u00a0kg\/m3. The pellets were crushed in an industrial blender, and fine particles were added to have a grain-size distribution known as the Fuller curve \n8\n\n,\n\n21\n with a maximum grain diameter of 6\u00a0mm (Fig.\u00a01a, b). The initial water content was 5.5\u20136.0\u00a0wt% and was selected to achieve the highest DD possible. Preliminary tests have shown that the Fuller-like grain-size distribution and high pellet DD yielded a satisfactory GBM DD when emplaced (e.g.,\u00a0Refs.\u00a010, 22). More details about the GBM can be found in Ref.\u00a08.\n\nFor the mock-up and in-situ backfilling tests, the GBM was emplaced using the above-mentioned prototype BFM. The BFM consisted of five horizontal screw feeders (0.2-m diameter) and a feeding wagon as shown in Fig.\u00a02. To achieve a homogeneous emplacement, the five screw feeders were distributed to uniformly cover the void space around the heaters and pedestals.\n9\n The length of the screw feeders ranged from 6.6 m to 8.5\u00a0m \n23\n to fit the GBM slope with an angle of repose of about 35\u00a0degrees when emplaced in the test tunnels.\n24\n The rotation speed and torque of the screws were computer-controlled to yield an optimum discharge of the GBM through the distribution box between the five screw feeders and the hopper on the feeding wagon.\nTo achieve the required DD, up to approximately 1\u00a0m of the tips of all screw feeders were driven into the GBM slope. The BFM was held in place by hydraulic brakes on steel rails to maintain high backpressure. The thrust from the screw feeders resulted in a compression of the GBM, leading to an increased emplacement DD. As a result, the repulsive force reached up to 32 kN. More details about the BFM can be found in Refs.\u00a014, 23.\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nMock-up backfilling test\nBackfilling of the mock-up tunnel was performed twice; the first test was conducted in May 2014 with the main objective of checking the BFM\u2019s technical functionality. In contrast, the second test focused on optimizing the procedure to achieve a high emplacement DD to ensure that the target DD would be achieved; it also focused on assessing the degree of heterogeneity, if any, in the GBM.\n9\n\n,\n\n14\n This paper reports only on the second test.\n\n3.1\nMock-up test setup\nA full-scale mock-up tunnel with dimensions of 2.52 m (inner diameter) \n\u00d7\n\u00a08.0\u00a0m (length) as shown in Fig.\u00a03 was used. The mock-up tunnel was located in a warehouse of the tunnel machinery company Belloli SA in Grono, Switzerland. The tunnel consisted of a bent sheet of metal with a thickness of 8\u00a0mm. Inside the mock-up tunnel, a cylinder (4.6 m in length, 1.05 m in diameter) simulating a disposal canister was placed on a pedestal, both of which were made of the same sheet metal.\n25\n The back end of the tunnel was closed with a slope slanted at an angle of 46 degrees. Although this exceeds the GBM\u2019s angle of repose of 35 degrees,\n24\n this slope was installed so that backfilling was conducted as if in continuation from the previous slope. The front end was left open to provide access for the BFM.\n\nThe mock-up tunnel configuration allowed for the construction of several holes at the top and windows along the sides for visual observations. Another major advantage was that the instrumentation tools could be installed from outside the tunnel, i.e.,\u00a0through the tunnel wall. A set of dielectric tools described in the following section was installed radially through the sheet-metal wall to quantify cross-sectional variation in the DD.\nBackfilling was performed from August 12 to 13, 2014. Using the BFM, GBM Mixture 3 was filled as continuously as possible, except when new bags of bentonite had to be loaded onto the feeding wagon.\n23\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nDielectric profile probe PR2 and dry density calibration\nThe DD of the emplaced GBM was measured using a commercially available soil moisture profile probe (Model PR2\/6, Delta-T Devices, UK, Fig.\u00a04), which was originally designed for various environmental and agricultural applications. The probe has six pairs of electrodes, each of which forms a dielectric sensor to measure water content at depths of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0\u00a0m. A 100 MHz signal is applied along each pair of stainless steel ring electrodes and the electrodes transmit the electromagnetic field extending up to about 0.1\u00a0m into the material of interest as indicated schematically based on a cylindrical sampling volume in Fig.\u00a04, and the sensor outputs a DC voltage (in mV) which is a function of the water content.\n26\n\n\n\nAs noted above, the GBM was produced to have a water content of 5.5\u20136.0\u00a0wt%. It was assumed that the water content would remain constant during the backfilling procedure because there was no water inflow into the mock-up tunnel, and the GBM was not exposed to extreme environmental conditions that would cause the moisture to evaporate. Under these conditions, a dielectric moisture sensor functions as a density measuring tool as follows: with a fixed water content by weight, the moisture sensor detects more water by volume within the sampling volume shown in Fig.\u00a04 when the density is higher. The dielectric sensor readings respond to the volumetric amount of water in the material and therefore reflect the DD of the GBM (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a022).\nThe manufacturer provides a calibration to convert the mV readings into soil moisture.\n26\n However, it is necessary to establish a new calibration that relates the mV readings to the DD of the GBM. To do this, the PR2 probe was placed vertically in the middle of a bucket with a diameter of around 0.3 m to enclose the sampling volume of the sensor. The bucket was first filled with the GBM as gently as possible to achieve the lowest density and the first set of measurements was taken. The density was increased in steps by tapping the bucket wall until no further increase was achieved.\nThe mV outputs ranged from 650 to 835\u00a0mV for the varying DD conditions to which a linear function (Eq.\u00a0(1)) was fitted. A high \n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\n value of 0.94 indicated that the linear function was sufficiently accurate to estimate the DD from the mV outputs. The 95% confidence intervals indicated an uncertainty of \n\u00b1\n56\u00a0kg\/m3 in the estimated DD. \n\n(1)\n\n\nDD\n=\n\n\n0\n.\n00212\n\u00d7\nvoltage\n+\n0\n.\n0839\n\n\n\u00d7\n1000\n\n\n\nwhere DD is in kg\/m3 and voltage reading in mV.\n\n\n3.3\nMeasurement procedure and results\nIn this measurement, 22 access tubes were installed in four different sections prior to backfilling as shown in Fig.\u00a05. Two of the sections (A at \n\nx\n=\n4\n.\n5\n\n m and a at 4.2\u00a0m) included the canister, whereas the other two sections (B at \n\nx\n=\n3\n.\n1\n\n m and b at 3.3\u00a0m) did not. In sections A and B, the access tubes were installed radially between the adjacent screw feeders. In sections a and b, the access tubes were installed 0.05 m away from the closest screw feeder. The access tubes in sections B and b were fixed to metal ring frames that have a diameter similar to that of the canister. Sections A and a, as well as B and b, were 0.3 and 0.2 m apart, respectively, to avoid a dense tube arrangement that might hinder the free flow and compaction of GBM during backfilling.\nAfter the backfilling was completed, measurements were taken. The PR2 probe was installed so that the midpoint of sensor number\u00a06 at the probe tip (see Fig.\u00a04) was positioned at a depth of 0.05 m from the tunnel wall (Fig.\u00a05). A measurement was taken, the mV reading from the sensor was recorded, and the probe was pushed into the access tube at 0.05-m intervals to a depth of 0.6\u00a0m. With the way the access tubes were installed, the maximum reachable depth from the tunnel wall was 0.6\u00a0m. The mV readings were always taken from sensor number\u00a06 because this was the only sensor that was able to reach a depth of 0.6 m from the tunnel wall. This process was repeated for all the access tubes. The mV values obtained were converted into DD using the calibration defined by Eq.\u00a0(1) and plotted in Fig.\u00a06.\n\n\n\nThe results of the dielectric measurement clearly showed a distinct heterogeneity over the cross-section. A close examination of the measured DD indicated that:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe DD values were generally higher along transects a1\u2013a5 and b1\u2013b5 near the screw feeders than transects A1\u2013A6 and B1\u2013B6 between the screw feeders.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe variations along transects a1\u2013a5 and b1\u2013b5 showed DD values as high as 1,684\u00a0kg\/m3 in the close vicinity of the screw feeders. The fiberglass-reinforced access tubes at transects a2, b2 and b4 broke in the vicinity of the screw feeder outlet, implying that the thrust from the roof screw feeders (numbers 2 and 4) was quite high.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe variations along transects A1\u2013A6 and B1\u2013B6 showed low to intermediate values (generally in the range of 1,300 to 1,500\u00a0kg\/m3).\n\n\n\u2022\nThe overall trend showed that the DD was low near the tunnel wall (as low as 1,275\u00a0kg\/m3).\n\n\n\u2022\nThe average DDs for transects a1\u2013a5 and A1\u2013A6 were 1,570 and 1,490\u00a0kg\/m3, respectively (Table\u00a01). The average of these two sets of transects representing the entire cross-section, including the canister, was 1,530\u00a0kg\/m3, which exceeded the required target DD of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn section B-b behind the canister, the overall trend was similar to that in section A-a. The average DDs along transects b1\u2013b5 and B1\u2013B6 were 1,550 and 1,510\u00a0kg\/m3, respectively (Table\u00a01). The average of the B-b sections was 1,530\u00a0kg\/m3, which exceeded the required target DD of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3.\n\n\n\nThe average DD was also calculated using the conventional mass-balance method, i.e.\u00a0dividing the mass of the emplaced GBM by the volume filled, which was obtained by a 3D scanner. The average DD values were as summarized in Table\u00a01 together with the average values of the dielectric measurements. The results based on the dielectric tool were consistent with the conventional mass-balance results.\nAn additional attempt was made to construct two-dimensional DD contours within the tunnel cross-sections. The obtained results are presented in Fig.\u00a07. As the PR2 measurements did not cover the entire domain, data from other measurements and individual assumptions were used to supplement the no-data areas as follows. Kriging was used for interpolation.\n\nAlong the tunnel wall: Point-wise measurements of DD along the wall \n27\n were used. A set of dielectric point sensors was installed at locations shown with small green circles in Fig.\u00a05(ii). For the left side, symmetry was assumed.\n\nAt the screw feeders: The sampling results from the in-situ backfilling were used. During the FE tunnel backfilling described above, DD at the tip of the screw feeders was periodically measured for quality control purposes. The BFM was pulled out, the GBM samples were collected from the tip of each screw feeder, and the sampled volume was estimated based on 3D laser scanning before and after sample collection.\n24\n The obtained mean DD values were 1,612, 1,753, 1,574, 1,714, and 1,560\u00a0kg\/m3 for screw feeders 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively (see Fig.\u00a05 for screw feeder numbers).\n\nBehind the heater (section B-b only): DD measured using the gamma\u2013gamma method along the blue dashed line denoted as \u201cgg\u201d shown in Fig.\u00a05(ii) was used. More details about the measurement can be found in Ref.\u00a025.\n\nThe estimated as-emplaced DD in Fig.\u00a07 showed a distinct heterogeneity over the tunnel cross-section ranging from around 1,300 to 1,700\u00a0kg\/m3. The blueish colors in the contours indicating a DD below the target DD of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3 were observed locally near the tunnel wall and between the screw feeders. Nonetheless, the cross-sectional average exceeded the target DD in all sections. The high densities closer to the screw feeders were expected as the compression force generated at the tip of the screw feeders decays as the GBM flows farther away from the screw feeder. This observation was consistent with the preliminary backfilling test with a single screw feeder in a two-dimensional tank.\n22\n The results indicated that the thrust force from the screw could be transmitted only over a certain distance, e.g.\u00a0roughly 0.3\u00a0m. It was also observed that the top half of the tunnel with three screw feeders showed slightly higher densities compared to the bottom half with two screw feeders. This implies that, in addition to the GBM specifications, conditions such as the number of screw feeders, their positions as well as the optimum GBM supply from the distributor to each of the screw feeders could be key design parameters when refining the backfilling procedure to achieve dense and homogeneous emplacement.\n\n\n\n4\nIn-situ backfilling test\n\n4.1\nBackfilling of the in-situ tunnel and dry density based on the mass-balance method\nThe Full-scale Emplacement (FE) experiment was designed to simulate the Swiss disposal concept for spent fuel\/vitrified high-level waste (Nagra, 2016) in a 50-m-long tunnel (referred to as the FE tunnel) excavated in the Opalinus Clay in the Mont Terri rock laboratory. The FE tunnel was constructed from April to July 2012 \n28\n with an average diameter of approximately 3\u00a0m. Shotcrete was applied as the tunnel lining. The resulting inner diameter of the tunnel, although not perfectly round, ranged from approximately 2.5 m to 2.7\u00a0m. The back portion of the tunnel (not discussed in this paper) was supported only by steel rings without shotcrete. Within the shotcrete interval, three heaters (dummy disposal canisters made of steel, 4.6 m in length, 1.05 m in diameter) were placed on pedestals made of highly compacted bentonite blocks as shown in Fig.\u00a08. More details about the FE tunnel can be found in Ref.\u00a014.\n\nThe BFM shown in Fig.\u00a02 was used to fill the void spaces between the canisters and the tunnel wall as well as the spaces between the canisters. Backfilling of the FE tunnel was conducted in twelve steps from September 2014 until February 2015 (Fig.\u00a09). The deepest section (the right-most trapezoidal section in Fig.\u00a09) was filled first to generate the slope of section 1. Backfilling was then repeated for sections 2 through 11 based on the procedure described earlier. The last section immediately behind the concrete plug was filled differently, i.e.,\u00a0the GBM was filled during the stepwise construction of the retaining wall with a reduced number of screw feeders as needed (for more details, see Ref.\u00a014). For each backfilling step, the mass of the filled GBM was recorded, and slopes 1 to 11 were scanned with a 3D laser scanner. Based on the scanned slopes, the newly backfilled volume was computed for each step. The backfilled bulk DD was then calculated for each section using the mass and filled volume.\nThe average DDs obtained for the twelve sections are shown at the top of Fig.\u00a09. The graph shows the profile of the average DD in each section plotted along the coordinates of the tunnel crown. The DD in section 12 immediately behind the concrete plug was only 1403\u00a0kg\/m3 and therefore lower than in the other sections. This was likely due to the challenging backfilling procedure with the retaining wall being built in steps at the plug location. The average DDs in the other sections varied from 1,444 to 1,555\u00a0kg\/m3. The overall average DD was 1,490\u00a0kg\/m3, which exceeded the target DD of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3. The DD in section 10 was slightly lower than the target value. The bentonite in this section was re-used from the mock-up filling test described earlier, and the lower density was believed to result from changes, although not confirmed, to, e.g.,\u00a0the grain-size distribution. Therefore, emplacing the GBM in the FE tunnel using the BFM and the optimized procedure has proven to be successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nDry density measurement using heated fiber-optic cables near the GBM-shotcrete interface\nThis section describes another in-situ DD measurement campaign in the FE tunnel based on an actively heated fiber-optic (FO) cable combined with distributed temperature sensing (DTS) referred to as active DTS (or a-DTS) throughout this paper. Conventional DTS is passive measurement of the temperature distribution along the FO cable (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a029). The a-DTS method has been receiving much attention recently in soil science for measuring soil moisture (e.g., Refs.\u00a030\u201332). This method was applied as a tool for monitoring the conditions of GBM \n33\u201335\n and was validated as the density measuring tool.\n35\n\n\n\n4.2.1\nHeatable FO cable in the FE tunnel\nIn the FE tunnel, various types of FO cables were installed as described in Refs.\u00a09, 14. Among these, a heatable FO cable was installed at the 00:30 and 11:30 clock positions of the tunnel cross-section, i.e.,\u00a0the tunnel crown (see Fig.\u00a08). The crown area was chosen for testing the a-DTS method because the DD variability in this area may be the most critical, i.e.,\u00a0with low DD as observed in the mock-up experiment (including possible detection of unfilled voids). Note that a single FO cable was routed in a unicursal manner along the crown in the lined section and along the perimeters in the unlined section as shown in Fig.\u00a08. To cover the entire length of the FE tunnel (including the unlined sections not discussed in this paper) and the niche where the measuring units were placed, the total length of the FO cable was 250\u00a0m. Along the FE tunnel crown, the FO cable was loosely fixed to the surface of the shotcrete with plastic clips at intervals of approximately 0.6\u20130.7\u00a0m. The shotcrete surface was undulant and, although not accurately measured, the FO cable was generally positioned at a distance of 0.01 to 0.05 m from the shotcrete surface.\nThe heatable FO cable used in this study was the multi-component cable BRUsens LLK-BSTH 85\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a010) manufactured by Solifos AG, Switzerland. With an outer diameter of 4\u00a0mm, the cable consisted of optical fibers, a gel-filled stainless steel tube, stainless steel and copper wires, and polyamide sheaths for protection and strength. Only one of the multi-mode fibers for Raman spectra DTS was used.\n\nIn the a-DTS method, the FO cable is electrically heated, and temperature responses along the cable are measured by the DTS unit. The measured temperature changes with time dT(t) are strongly affected by the thermal properties of the material surrounding the FO cable. Heat transfer from a line source is well understood and described, e.g.,\u00a0in Ref.\u00a036, and the thermal conductivity (K) of the surrounding material can be estimated using the following equation: \n\n(2)\n\n\nK\n=\nQ\n\/\n4\n\u03c0\na\n\n\n\nwhere Q is the applied heating power (W\/m) and a is the slope of the dT-ln t curve. This is known as the heat pulse method, which is explained in more detail in, e.g.,\u00a0Refs.\u00a035, 37, 38.\nThe typical, commercially available heat pulse sensor assumes homogeneous material along the relatively short needle with a typical length of 0.03\u20130.10\u00a0m (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a039). In the a-DTS method, a long heatable FO cable is used as the line heat source. Spatial variation in changes in the temperature responses thus indicates heterogeneity in the thermal conductivity along the FO cable. The GBM was produced to have a constant water content \n8\n up to emplacement. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of the GBM at the time of emplacement depends largely on the DD. Under such conditions, the temperature changes along the FO cable recorded by the DTS unit indicate the variation in the initial DD. In addition, any remaining voids due to imperfect backfilling would be detected as spots with a substantially lower thermal conductivity (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a040). Although observation windows such as those adopted in the mock-up experiment cannot be installed on the wall of the real tunnel, the a-DTS method also provides a way of looking along the tunnel wall and detecting unfilled voids.\n\n\n4.2.2\nDry density calibration\nTo convert the thermal conductivity profile along the FO cable obtained in the FE tunnel, the cable was calibrated at the Grimsel Test Site in Switzerland where the temperature and humidity are highly stable. Four boxes made of plywood with dimensions of 0.128 m inner width \n\u00d7\n 0.122 m inner height \n\u00d7\n 1.094 m length (0.0171\u00a0m3 inner volume) were filled with GBM with a DD of 1,740, 1,600, 1,450 and 1,350\u00a0kg\/m3, respectively (Table\u00a02). The FO cable was positioned along the centerline of the boxes.\n\n\n\nThe calibration procedure, DTS unit and current generator for heating were identical to those described in detail, e.g.,\u00a0in Ref.\u00a035. The FO cable was heated with a power of 2\u00a0W\/m for 3\u00a0h. The resulting dT(t) data were collected with the DTS unit with a sampling time of 30\u00a0s and a sampling resolution of 0.127 m (spatial resolution 0.254\u00a0m). Note that only 3\u201360\u00a0min of dT(t) data were used for the computation of thermal conductivity based on Eq.\u00a0(2). This was because the dT(t) data for the first 3\u00a0min largely reflected thermal properties of the FO cable itself,\n42\n and the dT(t) data after 60\u00a0min were affected by the box boundaries, i.e.,\u00a0the low thermal conductivity of plywood and air.\n35\n The obtained thermal conductivity K was plotted against DD in Fig.\u00a011. As the relationship between DD and K of the GBM materials has been well described by a quadratic function,\n34\n a quadratic function was fitted to the data. The best-fit function (Eq.\u00a0(3)) was obtained with a high \n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\n value. The 95% confidence intervals indicated that the error margin was quite narrow. \n\n(3)\n\n\nD\nD\n=\n\u2212\n375\n.\n84\n\n\nK\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n1653\n.\n8\nK\n+\n918\n.\n98\n\n\n\nwhere DD is in kg\/m3 and K in W\/mK.\nFor comparison purposes, the dashed line in Fig.\u00a011 represents the relationship obtained by a thermal analyzer in a separate test. A close agreement between the two measurements indicates that, if the data obtained under the conditions adopted are analyzed with the data for the first 3\u00a0min and the data after 60\u00a0min excluded as described above, the a-DTS method yields reliable thermal conductivity of the GBM.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3\nIn-situ heating of the FO cable after backfilling the FE tunnel\nIn the FE tunnel in the Mont Terri rock laboratory, as the backfilling progressed the heaters were started in steps between December\u00a015, 2014 and February 18, 2015. Since then, all three heaters have been operating with a power of 1350\u00a0W. The heatable FO cables installed at the 00:30 and 11:30 clock positions have been actively heated periodically since the beginning of the experiment. In Fig.\u00a012, the top view of the FO cable routing configuration is schematically illustrated. A single FO cable was installed in a unicursal manner as follows: the FO cable in the shotcrete section started at tunnel meter (TM) 15.0 at the 00:30 clock position just behind the concrete plug and retaining wall. It extended above the three heaters until TM 38.5, came down tangentially to about the 04:00 clock position, then made three loops in gaps 2, 4 and 6 in the unlined interjacent sealing section ISS (not discussed in this paper). After the third loop in gap 6, the FO cable was similarly routed back to the concrete plug at the 11:30 clock position.\n\nThe active heating of the FO cable performed on April 30, 2015, is described in this paper. This was the first a-DTS test after backfilling was completed in February 2015 and the concrete plug was constructed in March 2015. Due to the relatively low and localized water inflow from the tunnel wall, saturation of the GBM progressed slowly. Heating of the FO cable in April 2015 was assumed to yield the thermal conductivity of the GBM that reflected its initial DD with limited effects from changes in the moisture conditions. The in-situ heating test was performed using devices and settings that differed from those used in the calibration tests. The DTS unit was the DiTemp SR unit (Smartec, Switzerland). The FO cable with a total length of 250 m shown in Fig.\u00a08 was used. Other parameters were: sampling time 150\u00a0s, sampling resolution 1.02 m (spatial resolution 1.02\u00a0m), heating power \n\nQ\n=\n0\n.\n41\n\n W\/m, and heating time 180\u00a0min. Again, only 3\u201360\u00a0min of dT(t) data were used to compute thermal conductivity with Eq.\u00a0(2) so that the results were as compatible with the calibration as possible. The thermal conductivity could then be converted to DD using Eq.\u00a0(3).\n\n\n4.2.4\nIn-situ FO cable heating test results\n\nFig.\u00a013a presents the temperature profiles at different times when the FO cable was heated on April 30, 2015. Based on the temperature profiles, temperature changes dT(t) were calculated first, then the thermal conductivity was computed using Eq.\u00a0(2) and plotted in Fig.\u00a013b. The obtained thermal conductivity ranged from 0.25 to 0.40\u00a0W\/m along the FO cable.\nA separate test was conducted to investigate the effect of the separation between the FO cable and shotcrete surface on the obtained temperature changes.\n34\n\n,\n\n43\n Three boxes (2 m long, 0.1 m wide and deep) made of plywood were attached to the relatively flat vertical shotcrete surface under rough surface conditions. The boxes had an L-shaped cross-section and were installed such that the shotcrete formed one of the side walls. The FO cable was then placed in each box so that the separation from the shotcrete surface was 0.00, 0.02 and 0.05\u00a0m, respectively. In all boxes, GBM was emplaced to the same dry density. The results of the FO cable heating for 1\u00a0h indicated that the cases with a separation of 0.02 and 0.05 m led to a negligible influence of the shotcrete on the computed thermal conductivity. When the FO cable was fixed onto the shotcrete with zero separation, a small influence was observed. Given that the FO cable was loosely and periodically clipped onto the rough and undulant surface of the shotcrete in the FE tunnel, it would be reasonable to assume that the effects of the shotcrete on the dT data would be limited and that the computed thermal conductivity would solely reflect that of the GBM.\n\nThe thermal conductivity was then converted to DD using the calibration (Eq.\u00a0(3)) and plotted in Fig.\u00a013c. In general, the following observations were made:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe DD profiles obtained with the a-DTS method along the FO cable near the GBM-shotcrete interface of the FE tunnel crown indicated a certain level of variation.\n\n\n\u2022\nOverall, the estimated DD around the FO cable between TM 17.5 and 38.0 along the shotcrete-bentonite interface at the crown of the FE tunnel ranged from 1,297 to 1,498\u00a0kg\/m3. The overall average was 1,385\u00a0kg\/m3.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe majority of the measured DD range at both crown positions (i.e.,\u00a011:30 and 00:30) was lower than the required target DD of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3. As observed in the mock-up tunnel backfilling test results (see Fig.\u00a07), the DD tended to be lower at the tunnel crown.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe general variation in the measured DD profile did not exactly coincide with the slope averages along the tunnel axis plotted in Fig.\u00a09. This implied that the DD values measured with a-DTS at the crown location reflected the smaller scale of the local situation (i.e.,\u00a0decimeters of sampling volume around the FO cable at the tunnel crown, see Fig.\u00a07), whereas the slope averages represented DD on a larger scale (i.e.\u00a0the entire tunnel cross-section in the order of meters).\n\n\n\u2022\nThe DD profile at the 11:30 clock position showed slightly higher values (average \n=\n 1,419\u00a0kg\/m3, minimum \n=\n\n 1,320\u00a0kg\/m3, maximum \n=\n 1,498\u00a0kg\/m3) than that at 00:30 position (average \n=\n 1,351\u00a0kg\/m3, minimum \n=\n 1,297\u00a0kg\/m3, maximum \n=\n 1,402\u00a0kg\/m3). Before the tunnel was backfilled, discrete wet spots related to grout tubes at the mouth of extensometer boreholes were observed on the shotcrete lining at TM 19.0, 20.0, 26.6 and 31.6 at the 11:00 clock position. The higher thermal conductivity values at the 11:30 clock position could have been influenced by the moisture of the wet mouth of the extensometer boreholes. Therefore, the DD profile at the 00:30 clock position may better represent the initial DD at the tunnel crown after backfilling.\n\n\n\u2022\nDue to some degree of irregularity of the shotcrete surface, unfilled voids could have remained at the top portion of the tunnel cross-section. The measured DD profile along the FO cable at the 00:30 and 11:30 clock positions, however, did not show extremely low values. The results therefore indicated that no unfilled, or equivalently air-filled, voids remained at the tunnel crown along the lined section, demonstrating that the FO cable offered a functionality similar to that of the observation windows under in-situ conditions.\n\n\n\nIn this FO-cable-heating measurement, the distribution of the DD at the crown of the lined section in the FE tunnel was obtained. This can be considered as the initial condition of the GBM at this position when backfilling has been completed. Any changes in the K profiles observed afterwards in the a-DTS heating tests would be due to changes in water content resulting from water inflow into the FE tunnel and swelling.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion and conclusions\nGBM is an element of the EBS in the Swiss disposal concept for spent fuel\/vitrified high-level waste. To demonstrate the full-scale emplacement of GBM by means of a prototype BFM consisting of five screw feeders, an 8-m-long mock-up tunnel in a warehouse and a 50-m-long tunnel in the Mont Terri rock laboratory were backfilled. To ensure the successful emplacement of the GBM in these tests, the DD of the GBM was investigated based not only on conventional mass-balance averaging but also on other methods, namely the dielectric and a-DTS methods. The key results from the different measurements are summarized in Table\u00a03.\n\nIn the mock-up test, advantage was taken of the opportunity to install instrumentation from outside the tunnel (i.e.,\u00a0through the tunnel wall), and dielectric tools were installed to capture the DD variation of the emplaced GBM over the tunnel cross-section. This confirmed that the as-emplaced DD varied between 1,275 and 1,684\u00a0kg\/m3, generally with higher DD near the screw feeders and lower DD near the tunnel walls, including the crown area. The average cross-sectional DD estimated based on the variations was 1,530\u00a0kg\/m3, which corresponded well with the average DD of 1,502\u00a0kg\/m3 for the entire mock-up tunnel based on the conventional mass-balance method. It has to be emphasized that, to the best of our knowledge, the variation in DD over the tunnel cross-section had not been quantified in the previous mock-up or in-situ experiments elsewhere. As noted above, installing the tools through the tunnel wall is not feasible in a real tunnel.\nThe full-scale 50-m-long FE tunnel at the Mont Terri rock laboratory with three dummy disposal canisters was backfilled with GBM using the same BFM. In this test, the longitudinal DD distribution was measured with two methods: 1) slope-wise mass-balance averaging in twelve steps, and 2) a-DTS using a heatable FO cable at the crown along the entire lined section of the tunnel.\nThe slope-wise mass-balance average DD ranged from 1,403\u00a0kg\/m\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n to 1,555\u00a0kg\/m3, with an overall average of 1,490\u00a0kg\/m3 for the entire tunnel backfilled with the GBM (TM 15.0 to 44.65). The FO cable installed in the vicinity of the GBM-shotcrete interface at the tunnel crown yielded a DD ranging from 1,297\u00a0kg\/m\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n to 1,498\u00a0kg\/m3, with an average of 1,385\u00a0kg\/m3. The DD at the crown was generally lower than the required target value of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3. This was consistent with the results of the mock-up tunnel backfilling test that showed that the DD tended to be lower near the tunnel walls, including the crown area.\nThe DD of the GBM backfilled with the prototype BFM quantified in two separate full-scale tests (mock-up and FE tunnels) using three different methods (dielectric, mass-balance averaging, and a-DTS) showed variations at different scales in different directions. Combining all the findings, the overall DD of the emplaced GBM was shown to exceed the required target minimum value of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3. The longitudinal and cross-sectional variations, however, indicated that DD could locally be lower than the required minimum of 1,450\u00a0kg\/m3. Interfaces between the GBM and shotcrete liner recurrently showed low DDs. To what extent these findings are safety-relevant is being investigated within the framework of the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 BEACON Project (e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a017).\nFuture experiments should consider the following improvements to further refine the measurement quality:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nFuture mock-up tests should consider monitoring areas that were not well covered at this time, i.e.,\u00a0near the canister surface, near the pedestals, and, for multi-canister cases, the spaces between the canisters.\n\n\n\u2022\nFor the ongoing in-situ a-DTS test, some setting parameters can be refined in future active heating tests. Due to relatively noisy dT(t) data with a low heating power of 0.41\u00a0W\/m, the heating power should be increased to, e.g.,\u00a02\u20134\u00a0W\/m to obtain dT(t) data with a good S\/N ratio. A higher heating power may be necessary in some cases for more thermally conductive materials such as wet bentonite. The spatial sampling resolution could also be refined. Sampling time should also be reduced to, e.g.,\u00a030\u00a0s or shorter. More details about these improvements are provided in Ref.\u00a034.\n\n\n\u2022\nFor future in-situ experiments, the separation between the FO cable and shotcrete could be refined to optimize the accuracy of the DD estimation. In the FE experiment, due to constraints in installing the FO cables (i.e.,\u00a0to avoid damaging the cables during backfilling), the cable was installed near the shotcrete-GBM interface roughly 0.01\u20130.05 m from the shotcrete. Although the undulant shape of the tunnel wall makes it hard to consistently achieve the same separation between the FO and the tunnel wall, the minimum separation of 0.01 m was periodically confirmed in the FE tunnel, mostly at the positions where the FO cable was fixed to the wall using a plastic clip. The remainder of the FO cable was installed with a larger separation. Although the FE experiment revealed that the shotcrete had a limited influence, for future experiments it would be advantageous to install the FO cable with a clearly defined minimum separation to the tunnel wall to ensure minimal influence of the shotcrete on the estimation of thermal conductivity of the GBM. Although a continuous separation of at least 0.02 m was recommended as an example value, this may vary depending on conditions (e.g.,\u00a0heating duration, thermal conductivity of the tunnel wall, etc.). Further study is needed on this issue.\n\n\n\nThe overall results presented in this study provided fundamental but novel information regarding the potential range of DD variation within the as-emplaced GBM volume (longitudinal and cross-sectional) using the screw feeder-based BFM at full scale. Different methods yielded the DD of the GBM at different locations and at different spatial resolutions. A major advantage of the a-DTS method over other methods, i.e.,\u00a0the dielectric method and mass-balance averaging method, is the ability to yield a large number of measurements spatially (e.g.,\u00a0more than 40 DD values over three canisters presented in this example) with minimal disturbance due to the physical presence of the FO cable with a 4-mm diameter in the GBM.\nLastly, it has to be emphasized that the a-DTS method offers multiple features including (1) observation windows for detecting potentially unfilled voids, especially near the crown area (which used to be possible only in mock-up tests via observation windows\/holes), (2) a density profile measuring tool at the time of emplacement, which was the main scope of this study, and (3) a moisture profile measuring tool for later stages (which was not within the scope of this study but is discussed in, e.g.,\u00a0Ref.\u00a034. When the FO cable is not heated, the ambient temperature can be measured in passive mode, thus providing a tunnel-scale evolution of temperature resulting from the heat from the dummy disposal canisters. While generating a large amount of data along the FO cable with the least disturbance to the field, the a-DTS method offers the capability to monitor multiple quantities, thus functioning as an all-in-one monitoring tool.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nToshihiro Sakaki: Conception and design of study, Acquisition of data, Analysis and\/or interpretation of data, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

When stresses exceed the intact rock\u2019s strength or the remaining strength of a preexisting structural discontinuity, such as a fault or fracture, failure and irreversible deformation occurs in various forms. Numerous empirical criteria have been established over the years that describe this threshold for the onset of failure in different complexity using components and invariants of the second rank tensor describing the state of stress in the rock.\n5\n\n\nAny underground operation changes the state of stress of the subsurface to some degree. During some operations, significant stress field changes are unwanted and are often minimized to avoid any or unmanageable rock failure. Examples for such operations include the stable drilling of wells with an optimized mud weight and maintaining reservoir pressure via injection during hydrocarbon production.\n6\n Other operations actively impose and rely on stress changes as part of the procedure. One prominent example is hydraulic stimulation applied in conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs,\n7\n but also in deep geothermal reservoirs to create the fracture connectivity required for economic flow while keeping induced seismicity to a minimum.\n8\n\n,\n\n9\n Many other subsurface operations will inevitably change the stress field significantly, therefore planning procedures much account for the rock mechanical behavior to mitigate risks. Examples include early production from hydrocarbon reservoirs and end-of-field life procedures,\n10\n underground gas storage,\n11\n long-term nuclear waste disposal,\n12\n and underground engineering such as tunnel construction.\n13\n\n\nTo start understanding the state of stress at a given location, measurements can be performed in boreholes and underground facilities,\n14\n and indirect analyses can give insights, for example, by analyzing seismic focal mechanisms from earthquakes.\n15\n\n\nThis punctual information alone, however, is not sufficient to provide operational advice. Instead it is best used as calibration and verification data within numerical simulations that model the 3D geomechanical behavior of the subsurface.\n16\n Such simulations solve constitutive equations to provide insights into the 3D stress field of a selected part of the subsurface in its present state and predict future changes due to changing conditions.\n\n1.1\nCurrent landscape in numerical reservoir geomechanics\n3D geomechanical models based on the FE method as a numerical tool have been applied in the oil and gas industry for almost 30\u00a0years.\n17\n\n,\n\n18\n These numerical models integrate structural information of the subsurface with experimental data from laboratory testing and field measurements and observations. For several decades now, these models help to understand the mechanical behavior of the reservoir, its surroundings and structural discontinuities before and after field development and are invaluable for operational guidance to improve safety and economic viability of hydrocarbon reservoirs.\n6\n\n,\n\n19\u201321\n\n\nThe standard workflow to produce a 3D geomechanical model starts by generating a grid that discretizes the portion of the subsurface of interest. In the E&P industry, that would be the reservoir and its surroundings. This grid is constructed using the structural information gathered from seismic interpretation. Spatial resolution and geometrical complexity of these grids vary depending on the size of the field and the purpose of the model.\nThe mechanical and petrophysical rock properties are typically derived from sonic borehole measurements, lab experiments, and empirical correlations and are distributed across the grid. In recent years, seismic inversion is increasingly complementing or even replacing geostatistical methods to describe the property distribution in the inter-well space.\n22\u201324\n The governing material laws are defined, i.e.\u00a0the elasticity model and failure criteria best suited to describe the rocks involved, and the pore pressure is described throughout the model.\nIn addition to gravity, lateral boundary conditions are imposed to reflect the far-field tectonic situation, which is often taken from the World Stress Map.\n25\n The FE solver then computes the equilibrated steady state solution of the in-situ stress field across the model (Fig.\u00a01).\n\nFaults and fractures can be included following different approaches. However, all approaches share the fact that properties of these structural discontinuities can only be assumed and very rarely measured. Therefore, the assumed strength and compliance has to be adjusted so that the fault\u2019s influence on the stress field and reactivation behavior matches field observations or at least does not oppose them (Fig.\u00a02). For examples on fault modeling strategies in reservoir geomechanics, the reader can refer to\u00a0Cappa and Rutqvist\n26\n,\u00a0Haddad and Eichhubl\n27\n and Treffeisen and Henk\n28\n.\nFollowing an iterative calibration with field measurements focused mostly on the boundary conditions, the model\u2019s predictive value is verified using separate field data in blind tests. In many cases the present-day stress field is only the starting point for coupled simulations, in which the stress changes over time are computed as induced by pressure, temperature, and saturation changes during field development.\n29\n\n\nThe application of 3D geomechanical models in the E&P industry stretches across the life cycle of reservoirs form exploration to abandonment and across multiple technical domains including geology and geophysics, reservoir engineering, and drilling.\n16\n Application examples include analyses for fault seal capacity during exploration, wellbore stability for well construction, long-term well integrity and cap rock integrity, fault and fracture stability, solids production, compaction and subsidence, hydraulic stimulation, and many more (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a06, 19, 21, 30\u201333).\nThe first order measure for the size of the numerical simulation is the number of elements or cells of the model, since that translates via nodes and their constraints to the number of degrees of freedom that are solved for. Within the last decade, the average size of regular 3D geomechanical models has increased from roughly 2\u20138 million to 10\u201315 million elements (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a034, 35). Some operator\u2019s geomechanics teams are now routinely running simulations with 30\u201360 million elements, with a few studies already crossing the 100 million element threshold.\n36\n The run time for models generally depends on their size, the complexity involved from the structural side and the material model, and the computing environment. Most models that are built to assess risks and advise operations are typically run on local HPC clusters or in the cloud.\nAlthough the precise workflows might differ from the one outlined above, many other industries outside oil and gas that operate underground are also applying 3D geomechanical simulations mostly based on finite elements, but also using finite difference or finite volume methods. In deep geothermal reservoirs, understanding the stress field is crucial for successful stimulations that allow economically viable operations.\n9\n\n,\n\n37\n In carbon capture and sequestration projects, understanding the criticality of faults within or bordering the depleted reservoirs into which CO2 is injected is key for success.\n26\n\n,\n\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n In the site selection and construction of long-term nuclear waste disposals, understanding the stress field and predicting changes, e.g.\u00a0due to thermal loads over long periods of time is an important factor to ensure safe storage.\n40\u201342\n Last, but not least, geomechanical models are regularly applied to guide and optimize underground engineering projects such as tunnels.\n13\n\n\n\n\n1.2\nOld and new challenges\nGeomechanics experts in the oil and gas industry face many challenges. Some modeling challenges are inherent to the input data, such as the typically sparse data available for rock mechanical properties from laboratory experiments and for in-situ stress measurements, which complicates the calibration and verification of models. In addition, the variability in data quality can be large for all different types of data involved, including experimental data, field measurements, logs, and seismic data. Both, the limited availability and varying quality of data, in combination with the fact that model calibration is inherently non-unique, make new workflows using uncertainty and inversion techniques for model parameters so essential and powerful.\n43\n\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in geomechanics studies is the demand to generate numerical models covering large volumes in the subsurface in high resolution to capture all available data. This increase in required model size stretches across orders of magnitudes with teams going from 10 million element models to 100 million and even planning for over 1\u00a0billion elements. This study is based on this challenge that the industry is facing, which is to work with large-scale models in feasible turnaround times.\n\nThere are many reasons for this increase in geomechanics simulation size. One reason is the growing size of fluid flow models using high-resolution reservoir simulators, which often represent the basis for corresponding geomechanical models.\n44\n\n,\n\n45\n In other cases, the use of seismic inversion data to assist and even drive the mechanical property modeling often comes with the ambition to preserve the 3D seismic resolution across large volumes to be able to screen for geomechanics-related risks, e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a046.\nA common modeling approach to increase spatial resolution locally in a full-field simulation are so-called sector models (Fig.\u00a02). Sector models can be solved either simultaneously using local grid refinements or explicitly using precomputed solutions. In the explicit case, the sector models with higher resolution than the full-field simulation use pre-computed displacement results of the encompassing model to define Dirichlet boundary conditions of the sector simulation.\nAlthough this approach helps to focus the solution in an area of interest, local grids cannot fully substitute the need for higher resolutions in large-scale simulations for two reasons. Firstly, the surrounding \u201ccoarse\u201d mesh should still be able to capture the behavior to provide a sufficiently accurate boundary condition for the sector model. Secondly, large changes in adjacent cell sizes can introduce numerical artifacts in the sector model. These artifacts can arise because of numerical instabilities of the simultaneous solutions (e.g.,\u00a0low condition numbers) or because of the low-resolution boundary conditions.\nThere are also practical challenges in pre and postprocessing large geomechanical models. Generating grids with multiple hundreds of millions of cells and populating properties across such grids can become very time consuming because of memory and visualization requirements. The main practical challenge, however, is solving the linear system of equations. Most commercially available FE simulators offer parallelization mechanisms. However, simply distributing the simulation over an increasing number of processors using message passing interface (MPI) tasks will not be enough to make it work on this scale. While the memory demand per MPI decreases with more MPI tasks, it will most likely still be substantial and more than a single standard HPC compute node offers, especially when more than one MPI task is running per compute node.\nIn addition to storing a very large stiffness matrix, this high memory demand is also related to the fact that in geomechanical simulations, the solver must be able to include as many material sets as elements are in the model. This is because the 3D property distribution is typically at least guided by seismic inversion data, if not directly derived from it, and thus the mechanical property values are varying on a cell-by-cell basis within and across formations. Assuming representative but constant sets of mechanical properties for each formation will allow to reduce the related memory requirement drastically and allow even unoptimized solvers to run large simulations. However, the predictive value of the resulting models would suffer significantly from such simplification. To guide and ensure safe and sustainable subsurface operations, geomechanical investigations must not constrain the fidelity of input data, instead numerical tools should cope with the computational requirements.\n\n\n\n2\nSeismic geomechanics on a new scale\nThis study explores the notion of how the appropriate combination of the modeling approach, compute environments and optimized FE solvers can address the need for geomechanical models with hundreds of millions to over a billion elements.\nA new way of generating the geomechanical model directly from seismic data was applied on a case study dataset from the Gulf of Mexico. This more direct approach allows to bypass classical gridding and modeling constraints to generate numerical simulations for the subsurface volume of interest faster and more efficiently for both, pre and postprocessing. Multiple models were built to the seismic resolution and exported for simulation on the original seismic grid.\nThe main part of the study focused on the developments and improvements for the numerical solver. While most commercial FE solvers allow multimillion element simulations, several problems arise when approaching simulation sizes of a billion elements with strongly heterogeneous material models as is standard in seismic geomechanics. The FE solver used in this methodology was improved especially in its memory efficiency and parallelization to be able to solve geomechanical simulations on such new scales on state-of-the-art HPC infrastructures.\nBoth methodological advances, the modeling approach and the improved solver, as well as the HPC compute environment, would independently facilitate large-scale stress modeling, but are combined in this study for optimal results.\n\n2.1\nDirect modeling approach\nWhenever seismic inversion results provide sufficient input and quality, those are directly used as basis for the mechanical property model and complemented with log data. This approach is increasingly applied in the E&P industry due to the higher predictability of the resulting model in the inter-well space. In the pursuit of speeding up the model-building process and making it more efficient for large simulations, this approach is taken one step further, and the seismic volumes are utilized directly to generate the simulation input and the generation of new grids is avoided. Instead the seismic volume itself is used as the perfectly structured grid it already represents.\nThe seismic data on which the two main case study models are based describes a total subsurface volume of 34.2\u00a0km \n\u00d7\n 28.3\u00a0km \n\u00d7\n 5.5\u00a0km (Fig.\u00a03). The seismic inversion volumes start from the seabed and attributes are quality checked before being used for the setup of the mechanical property model. In the same way seismic properties and derived attributes are mapped in the seismic volume, such as velocities and acoustic impedance, the static elastic properties are calculated including Young\u2019s modulus or Poisson ratio. Common 3D modeling platforms typically offer enough flexibility for seismic calculations, so empirical correlations can be applied to provide the full range of input properties for standard geomechanical simulations as seismic volumes.\n\nThe depth-converted vertical resolution of the seismic was 5\u00a0m with a horizontal resolution of 25 m in both directions. Two main numerical models were generated with 1,068,546,976 and 522,576,600 elements in total (Fig.\u00a03), with grids identical to the structure of the utilized seismic volumes. The mechanical properties for the geomechanical model are derived from seismic cubes of compressional and shear wave velocity and density provided by a deterministic seismic inversion. The static and dynamic elastic properties are assumed to be identical as a first approximation, but empirical correlations could be used to modify properties accordingly. The range of values for all properties is given in Table\u00a01.\n\nThe mechanical behavior of the salt bodies is approximated by a high Poisson ratio of 0.5 and a low Young\u2019s modulus of 0.3 GPa. This suppresses deviatoric stresses in the salt and results in the boundary of a salt body acting as a principal stress plane. While more elaborate salt behavior and properties could be accounted for including creep, such complexity is beyond the scope of this study. The pore pressure in this model is also derived from seismic and shows substantial variations and overpressured zones. Below a depth of 4\u00a0km beneath the seabed, the pressure gradients reach over 0.17 bar\/m. In shallower zones, the pressure gradient is close to hydrostatic. Inside the salt body, the pressure is set to zero.\nSeismic volumes describing mechanical properties and pore pressure are exported directly as simulation deck for the numerical solver. In addition to gravity, Dirichlet-type displacement boundary conditions are imposed on the model to reflect the far-field tectonic influence. Since the main target of this study was stress initialization, no additional embedding was imposed as there were no internal loads applied, such as pressure or temperature changes, that could have been affected by their proximity to the boundaries. In any case, the model size would have allowed load changes in the interior within a reservoir-sized region with sufficient distance to the boundaries as to consider the model to be effectively embedded. The case study models are also aligned with the far-field stresses and displacements were applied normal to the boundaries to minimize edge effects. Including the applied displacement constraints, the largest numerical model reflected over 3.2 billion degrees of freedom to be considered when computing the elastic, steady-state stress solution.\nThis approach has multiple significant advantages when pushing the scale of geomechanical simulations. Firstly, the seismic grid is perfectly structured, i.e.\u00a0the cells (hexahedra) are of equal shape and size as given by the seismic resolution (25\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 25\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 5\u00a0m). This uniformity allows to convey the grid information to the simulator as \u2018instruction\u2019 rather than \u2018description\u2019. In other words, instead of writing classical element and node files with coordinates, the simulator is told the absolute grid size and the element spacing in all dimensions and is then able to calculate the coordinates when required. This saves disk space and time for creating, exporting, and reading files, which can range from tens to hundreds of gigabytes for the targeted scale of simulation.\nSecondly, seismic volumes regularly have hundreds of millions of cells and even multiple billion cells. 3D subsurface modeling platforms can visualize such seismic cubes and intersections on common workstations very quickly and offer many display options for 2D and volume rendering. However, most platforms would struggle with arbitrary grid visualization on the same scale.\nIn addition, time is also saved by the lack of property modeling operations, which can become very time consuming for large models. The 3D seismic data is also preserved throughout the volume of interest and not downscaled when resampled into a separate grid with potentially lower horizontal resolution. Despite some disadvantages that are discussed later, this workflow facilitates significantly the pre and postprocessing for geomechanical models on the targeted new scale.\n\n\n2.2\nFE solver improvements\nThe key factor for running large-scale stress simulations in high resolution is the numerical solver. The objective of this study was to optimize an existing solver\n1\n\n\n1\nThe optimized iterative solver is part of the VISAGE simulator. VISAGE is a mark of Schlumberger.\n to be able to run such models in time frames acceptable to industry workflows. An iterative solver based on the conjugate gradient method was used as iterative solvers are highly parallelizable, which is paramount for feasible turnaround times of large simulations.\n\n\n2.3\nParallelization and memory efficiency\nMost advanced numerical simulations are solved nowadays in parallel on multiple processors, either on a single machine or on clusters with many connected compute nodes. By distributing the computational load, this allows significantly faster solutions. MPI is widely adopted as standard communication protocol for such distribution. Multiple communicating MPI tasks are running on separate processors and are each solving a part of the numerical problem independently.\nWith an increasing number of MPIs, the problem size for each task reduces and therefore the associated memory required. However, the decrease in memory required per MPI with an increasing number of tasks is limited by the need for an overlap between the computational domains and the fact that MPI tasks do not share memory. Therefore, parts of the data need to be duplicated among some or all of the MPI tasks.\nNumerical solvers commonly use three main types of arrays, which are element arrays, degree of freedom (DOF) arrays, and solver arrays. To reduce memory demand, these arrays must be reduced in size and split as much as possible across all MPI tasks. This work represented the core of the solver improvements in this study. While element arrays are distributed perfectly between MPI tasks and solver arrays describing all nonzero terms, as well as working arrays are split with only a minor overlap of less than one percent, the improvements focused on the split of DOF arrays with an overlap of less than five percent.\nFor a simulation with one billion linear hexahedral elements with approximately three billion DOF, roughly 22\u00a0GB of memory are required per DOF array when stored either as double precision real arrays or 64bit integer arrays. Depending on the simulation, there are between 10 to 15 arrays and even with 10 arrays about 200\u00a0GB of memory could be saved per MPI task.\nIn addition, several arrays are removed to reduce the memory demand and improvements were also required for the broadcasting of material data across MPI tasks to avoid spikes in memory demand.\nThe memory requirements of the improved solver for stress simulations with heterogeneous\u200b material models are plotted in Fig.\u00a04 as the relationship between the number of MPI tasks and the memory required per MPI task for four examples of simulation size. The plotted memory requirement is given for arbitrary grids, be those structured or unstructured in nature. For the perfectly structured grids as the seismic volumes used in this study, the memory demand is about further 5% lower.\n\nWhile the memory demand decreases significantly per MPI task with higher degree of parallelization, it approaches asymptotically a minimum memory limit required per MPI that depends on the simulation size (Fig.\u00a04).\nTo solve the targeted large-scale stress simulations on powerful, yet common HPC clusters, the number of MPI tasks running on a single compute node must be limited. Even with improved memory efficiency, multiple MPI tasks would swiftly exceed available memory. In other words, pure MPI-based parallelization is inadequate for the objectives of this study.\nA hybrid approach using MPI and OpenMP (OMP) is adopted to achieve more memory-efficient parallelization. OpenMP stands for Open Multi-Processing and allows shared memory multithreading of applications. With MPI, each individual processor has a copy of the data it needs to run. While most data can be split across the tasks evenly, there are some parts of the dataset that need to be duplicated. With the shared memory assumption that can be made with OMP, this duplication can be cut down considerably, as each processor can access the same store of memory where this data exists. As such the memory efficiency of pure OMP is higher than that of pure MPI, but with the limitation that OMP can only be applied within a single compute node. The hybrid parallelization approach uses both MPI and OMP, such that OMP threads are used for parallelism within a multi-core compute node, while MPI is used for parallelism between nodes.\n\nThis hybrid approach enables a far more efficient use of processing power on the HPC cluster available. Fig.\u00a05 illustrates the memory required per compute node with an increasing number of CPUs being used. This example assumes 16 compute nodes being available with 16 processors each. By distributing every additional MPI task on a separate node, the memory required per compute node decreases until all 16 nodes are involved. From this point onward, adding additional MPI tasks per node to utilize more processing power significantly increases the memory demand for each node (Fig.\u00a05). It becomes likely that while reserving the full compute nodes for their memory, only a fraction of CPUs can be utilized to solve the numerical simulation before violating the memory constraints.\nThe hybrid approach allows the CPUs within each node to be utilized via OMP threads, which results only in a minor overhead in memory demand per compute node (Fig.\u00a05). This hybrid parallelization is key for solving stress simulations on the scale targeted in this study.\n\n\n2.4\nVariable handling and input file reduction\nIn addition to coping with increased memory requirements, variables used inside the solver had to be changed and simulation input reduced to speed up preprocessing times.\nFor simulations with up to 150 million linear hexahedral elements, 32-bit signed integers are sufficiently large to store arrays. The maximum size of such integer variables is \n\u00b1\n231\u00a0\n\u2212\n\u00a01 \n=\n\n\n\u00b1\n2,147,483,647 and using larger integers would increase memory demand without any benefit. With increasing simulation size approaching a billion elements, however, the size of required arrays demands larger integers.\n\nHere are two examples. (I) The FE simulation solves for the displacements at each node. There are three types of displacement allowed, one along each axis. This results in over three billion DOF assuming linear hexahedral elements, which exceeds the integer size above. (II) Another issue arises at the core of the solution in the linear solver where a sparsely populated symmetric three billion \nx\n three billion array is used. When storing only the non-zero terms of which there might be 80 per row, for example, this will result in 120 billion non-zero values to be stored. This also exceeds the previously described 32-bit limit for integers even for models below one billion elements.\nThis limitation was overcome by using 64-bit signed integers. This means that the maximum size of an integer becomes \n\u00b1\n263\u00a0\n\u2212\n\u00a01 \n=\n\n\n\u00b1\n9,223,372,036,854,775,807. However, some integers are required to remain at 32-bit, for example for MPI communication. Currently there is a limit on the amount of data that can be sent and received in one broadcast between distributed MPI tasks due to the use of 32-bit integers in the MPI library. This equates to a 2\u00a0GB limit on data size. Therefore, additional functions are implemented in the solver to split any arrays over this size to send and receive them in less than 2\u00a0GB chunks.\nTo reduce simulation input and speed up pre-processing, the format of required input files was changed to compressed and binary formats. This greatly reduces file size and processing time in the solver. Especially for geomechanical models that exhibit a heterogeneous property distribution and a one billion element model has one billion material definitions, such changes reduce preprocessing significantly.\nThe perfectly structured grids presented by seismic volumes and used in this study are also exploited to reduce input. Solving complex structured and completely unstructured grids requires the simulator to receive information on node position and element type. This information is typically given in files describing nodal coordinates and the global node to element topology. As the seismic volumes represent perfectly structured grids and it was decided to only use eight-node hexahedral elements, the solver was enabled to calculate the nodal coordinates and global node to element topology when required in the computation. This means that two of the largest input files do not have to be generated, exported, and read during the simulation. For an exactly one billion element model, these two files represent more than 50\u00a0GB of data. Moreover, the solver does not have to store the element topology and nodal coordinates as arrays saving additional 5% of memory.\n\n\n2.5\nHigh-performance computing environment\nSolving numerical FE models of half a billion elements upwards in feasible time frames, i.e.\u00a0multiple hours to a few days, requires a modern compute infrastructure. The simulations in this study were run on a HPC cluster to assess the improvements of the numerical solver and the utility of optimizations provided with the compute infrastructure. Two clusters are used for these runs with different configurations.\nThe main cluster configuration includes 48 compute nodes with each node containing two Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Platinum 9242 Scalable Processors.\n2\n\n\n2\n\nhttps:\/\/ark.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/ark\/products\/194145\/intel-xeon-platinum-9242-processor-71-5m-cache-2-30-ghz.html.\n These processors each comprise 48 cores per CPU, which provides 96 cores per node and 4608 cores in total. The base frequency of these processors is 2.3\u00a0GHz, and the maximum turbo frequency is 3.80\u00a0GHz. Each node of the cluster is equipped with 384 GB of DDR4 memory. To ensure memory bandwidth is maximized in this configuration, each of the 12 primary memory channels per processor is populated with 16 GB DIMMs clocked at 2933 MHz.\nA Lustre\n3\n\n\n3\n\nhttp:\/\/lustre.org\/.\n parallel filesystem is employed within the cluster to provide high IO performance for reading and writing files. This subsystem presents 60 TiB of available storage capacity, which is served from eight object storage servers and two metadata servers. These servers within the cluster each contain two Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae E5-2697 CPUs\n4\n\n\n4\n\nhttps:\/\/ark.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/ark\/products\/81059\/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2697-v3-35m-cache-2-60-ghz.html.\n and 128 GB memory. These CPUs have a base processor frequency of 2.6\u00a0GHz and a turbo frequency of 3.6\u00a0GHz.\nTo provide high bandwidth and low latency communications both between the compute nodes and with the storage system, an Intel\u00ae Omni-Path fabric is used for the interconnect within this HPC cluster. This type of interconnect is crucial for distributed computing using MPI on multiple compute nodes for communication-intensive FE simulations.\nA second compute subsystem of the HPC cluster is used for its increased memory capacity. The configuration includes 16 compute nodes with each node containing two Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Gold 6148 processors.\n5\n\n\n5\n\nhttps:\/\/ark.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/ark\/products\/120489\/intel-xeon-gold-6148-processor-27-5m-cache-2-40-ghz.html.\n These processors comprise 20 cores per CPU with a base processor frequency of 2.4\u00a0GHz and a maximum turbo frequency of 3.70\u00a0GHz. In contrast to the first configuration, this cluster is equipped with 768 GB of DDR4 memory per node. This required populating both the primary and secondary memory channels of the CPUs with 24 \n\u00d7\n 32 GB DIMMs per node. As in the first cluster configuration, a parallel filesystem and high bandwidth and low latency interconnect fabric is used to ensure optimal IO performance and cross-node communication.\nThese HPC configurations allowed to prove that with an optimized numerical solver and hybrid parallelization turnaround times of less than 4\u00a0h can be achieved for geomechanical simulations of more than 500 million elements. The increased memory capacity provided in the second HPC configuration also allowed to run case study simulations above one billion elements and over 3.2 billion DOF.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nThe simulations performed for the two models outlined in Fig.\u00a03 show that with an optimized numerical solver and a suitable compute environment, feasible runtimes for large-scale high-resolution geomechanical models can be achieved.\nThe model with roughly 500 million elements and 1.5 billion DOF was solved in multiple hybrid parallelization setups. With the provided HPC configuration, an optimal runtime of 3\u00a0h and 36\u00a0min is achieved with 96 MPI and 32 OMP tasks per MPI utilizing 3072 cores in total. This runtime is well within the timeframe required in the oil and gas and other industries for the operational use of such models. Fig.\u00a06 shows the reduction in runtime for the 500 million element simulation as it is decreased from several days to only a few hours.\nThe largest model generated for the case study area with over one billion elements and 3.2\u00a0billion DOF could be solved on only 16 compute nodes with extended memory capacity in 48\u00a0hours. These results demonstrate that with an optimized solver and suitable compute infrastructure, the runtimes of such large models are not a limiting factor for their wider application across industries.\nFor this study, the generated simulation results are postprocessed and visualized as seismic volumes and on related cross-sections. The simulation results reflect the model complexity and show the stress field being perturbed by the salt diapirs in terms of stress orientation and magnitude as expected (Fig.\u00a07). Close to the salt, the maximum principal stress is oriented perpendicular to the surface of the salt body. This is expected with the almost fluid-like behavior of salt and is in agreement with other numerical studies, e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a047\u201349. With increasing distance from the salt body, the magnitude of the stress rotations decreases, while the magnitude changes are largely driven by the heterogeneity of the material model.\n\nTo highlight locations of high shear stress around the salt bodies, the equivalent stress is calculated (Eq.\u00a0(1)) and visualized on cross-sections in Fig.\u00a08. \n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ne\nq\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nx\nx\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ny\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ny\ny\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ny\nz\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nz\nx\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith either a high stress anisotropy or a highly fractured area at these locations, any well being drilled through such region is likely to experience problems of wellbore stability. Such considerations are typically included in the planning of directional drilling through salt to ensure safe operations when entering and exiting salt bodies, e.g.\u00a0see Ref.\u00a050.\n\nThe direct application of the simulation results for preliminary drilling risk analyses is illustrated on two cross-sections through the modeled area (Fig.\u00a09). Stress perturbations around the salt bodies highlight potential impacts on safe drilling window estimates and depict how far these effects can reach into the surroundings. For example, the minimum in-situ principal stress is commonly used as the fracture gradient and describes the upper limit of the safe mud weight window, i.e.\u00a0mud losses are likely to occur whenever the equivalent circulating density of the drilling mud reaches this limit. In this example, reductions in the fracture gradient below the main salt body suggest the potential for losses of drilling fluid that are very costly and risk safe operations (Fig.\u00a09). Prior knowledge of these fracture gradient reductions can help to plan wells with improved casing plans and\/or detailed contingency strategies. Similarly, increased stress magnitudes toward the flanks of the salt body can serve as indicators of possible overpressures in adjacent shale formations due to undrained loading.\nOther simulation results can provide insights into more advanced wellbore stability topics. For example, the selection of optimum drilling directions can be a function of the relative orientation of the borehole with respect to the in-situ stress orientation. Under certain conditions, salt bodies can influence both the azimuthal and vertical orientation of the principal stresses. In this example, the presence of excess shear stress (shown for the ZX plane) is a direct consequence of the salt presence, and it signals a vertical tilt of the principal in-situ stresses (Fig.\u00a09). This information, along with the rest of the stress tensor, provides very important information when designing optimal well orientations near salt structures.\nThese results illustrate that simulating the 3D state of stress in the subsurface allows to assess and quantify the depth and extent of areas that are posing risks to drilling, production or other subsurface operations. Simulation results obtained with the applied direct modeling approach can be interrogated and displayed as usual for geomechanical studies. Despite the extraordinary size of the geomechanical model, postprocessing, and visualization is managed in normal turnaround times. This modeling approach has proven to be particularly useful when it comes to large-scale screening for subsurface geomechanical risks in high resolution.\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThe applied modeling approach directly using seismic volumes and the underlying perfectly structured seismic grids has been proven suitable to solve the problems related to pre and postprocessing of large-scale geomechanical models. While this approach also has its merits for certain types of projects, there are drawbacks for other studies. Geomechanical models are commonly based on grids that are aligned with subsurface geometry including horizons, geobodies and faults, and often vary in local resolution and element shape as required by the data, the project scope and for computing efficiency. The current approach lacks this flexibility and is thus limited for arbitrary application. Along irregular boundaries of geobodies with a significant contrast in mechanical properties, for example salt bodies, small-scale stress perturbations can be observed as artifacts on an element-by-element level. These perturbations were considered sufficiently small for the scale of this study. However, it is possible to include vertical adjustments in the adopted seismic grid to account for horizons, for example, without sacrificing the computing benefits of the structured seismic grid entirely. Even local grid refinements using multipoint constraints could be realized.\nFaults could be included on such structured grids by identifying the respective elements and then either following an equivalent material approach or by applying other discontinuity modeling techniques, such as extended finite element methods.\n51\n\n,\n\n52\n\n\nThe scale of the structural features that a seismic survey is able to resolve can be also several times coarser than the sampling rate of the seismic grid. Hence, to optimize the geomechanical model following this direct approach, one could also adjust the resolution of the seismic cubes used for the numerical model according to the known resolution of the particular seismic survey. However, the objective of the case study was to build a large-scale geomechanical model of the size and resolution as required by the data without the need for compromises in simulation size or sector modeling approaches, and therefore the given resolution was assumed to be required.\nAnother drawback of this direct modeling approach is the limited modeling capability on seismic volumes. While general calculations are available for seismic attributes on 3D modeling platforms, there is no functionality to upscale logs, for example, or run geostatistical methods. This limits the modeling approach significantly whenever the data situation would require such procedures.\nWhile the numerical solver was optimized to take advantage of input provided on perfectly structured grids, such as seismic volumes, it is not limited to this type of grid for running large models. Structured grids help to reduce file IO and memory consumption additionally, but the solver has been optimized in terms of efficiency also for partially structured and unstructured grids. This is crucial since 3D modeling platforms are improving visualization and rendering techniques so that the current pre and postprocessing limitations are most likely resolved in the upcoming years and arbitrary grids will be used on this new scale.\nThe case study models were solved in one linear elastic initialization load step. Although more sophisticated formulations could have been applied, for example, fully coupled poroelasticity and plasticity, such considerations are more applicable to reservoir-scale geomechanical simulations rather than to the large-scale models that this study targets for regional geomechanical screening workflows.\nWhen it comes to the final memory requirements for numerical models above half a billion cells, those are still considerable and a few years back that would have posed a serious problem (Fig.\u00a04). However, chip technology is progressing fast and the latest processor technology can provide up to 2TB of memory per CPU. While such chips are admittedly rare to have in a standard cluster, compute nodes with 512\u2013786\u00a0GB of memory are not rare for newly built HPC clusters. Moreover, the uptake of cloud computing offers entirely new possibilities, which makes memory just another parameter to request when provisioning cloud resources for simulations.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThis study shows how a commercial FE simulator for 3D geomechanical modeling is optimized in multiple aspects to solve numerical simulations on a large scale of hundreds of millions of elements and more. The new capability is demonstrated using a real-world dataset from the Gulf of Mexico to generate geomechanical models to the original data resolution, in this case seismic inversion data. The models comprise a fully heterogeneous material distribution and are built directly from seismic data following a new direct modeling workflow. Using state-of-the-art HPC infrastructure, these stress simulations can be solved in about 3.5\u00a0h using over 3000 CPUs, which demonstrates feasible turnaround times for this new scale of stress simulations. While a local compute cluster was used in this study, equal and larger compute capacity can be accessed in cloud environments. This new scale of numerical FE models enables geomechanical investigations of the subsurface in unrivaled detail and resolution to improve operations in the energy industry for safe production of hydrocarbons, but also provide mechanical safety constraints for geothermal reservoirs, CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste disposal, and underground engineering in general.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nKarsten Fischer: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing, Project administration.

Design and assessment procedures for geotechnical works in these areas have been developed based on shared valuable expertise, with little attention on comprehensive constitutive approaches. However, accurate description of the pre-failure behaviour and better understanding of failure modes, which cannot be accurately predicted by simpler approaches (e.g.\u00a0Nova and Hueckel\n1\n; Nova\n2\n\n,\n\n3\n), require advancements in constitutive modelling capabilities. Besides the application in geotechnical engineering problems, constitutive modelling efforts are inherently valuable in underpinning comprehensive understanding of soil behaviour and guiding further improvement of experimental testing, theoretical understanding and numerical modelling.\nThe constitutive approaches developed in the last decades for loose sands and soft clays seem satisfactory to understand and predict the geotechnical response of these soils (Lade et al.\n4\n; Yoshimine et al.\n5\n; Lade\n6\n; Li and Dafalias\n7\n; Manzari and Dafalias\n8\n; Dafalias and Manzari\n9\n; Dafalias et al.\n10\n; Taiebat and Dafalias\n11\n; Wheeler et al.\n12\n; Karstunen and Koskinen\n13\n; Leoni et al.\n14\n; Sivasithamparam et\u00a0al.,\n15\n among others). On the contrary, constitutive modelling for peats lags behind, due to apparently contradictory information coming from classical laboratory tests. The observed inconsistencies are attributed typically to the natural heterogeneity and to the contribution of fibres, which are claimed to hinder significance of laboratory tests and advanced comprehension of the mechanical response of peats. As a result, empirical paradigms have often substituted comprehensive modelling attempts.\nMost of the modelling effort in the past has been directed towards the time dependent compression behaviour, which received a lot of attention due to the engineering consequences of unusually high compressibility (Berry and Poskitt\n16\n; Edil and Mochtar\n17\n; Fox et al.\n18\n; Den\u00a0Haan and Edil\n19\n; Den\u00a0Haan\n20\n; Mesri et al.\n21\n; Den\u00a0Haan and Kruse\n22\n; Mesri and Ajlouni\n23\n; Zhang and O\u2019Kelly\n24\n; Madaschi & Gajo,\n25\n among others). However, only few attempts have included a wider perspective on the stress\u2013strain response over general stress paths (e.g.,\u00a0Yamaguchi et al.\n26\n; Yang et al.\n27\n; Muraro et al.\n28\n).\nTo start filling the gap towards comprehensive modelling approaches, an extensive experimental investigation was designed and performed at Delft University of Technology \n29\u201331\n on natural and reconstituted samples of Dutch organic clays and peats. The aim of the research effort is better analysing the pre-failure deformation behaviour of these soils, tackling the apparently contradictory results and providing reliable information to advance the development of constitutive models for engineering purposes. The effort was supported by a parallel numerical investigation, aimed at highlighting bottlenecks in the interpretation of the data.\nParadigmatic data from laboratory tests performed on reconstituted and natural samples of peat are presented and discussed in view of their significance in the development of constitutive models. Numerical analyses are presented to support the use of the laboratory data in the development of a constitutive framework. It is shown that the results can be better exploited if they are interpreted as the response of a small-scale boundary value problem, instead of as the pure evidence of material element behaviour. The role of distinct fibres levels, having different length, spatial distribution and interaction with the peat matrix is addressed, in an attempt to encompass the differences between reconstituted and natural peats.\n\n\n2\nBackground\nPeats are sedimentary materials mostly made of partially decomposed organic matter (leaves, roots, fibres), having extremely high porosity, n \n\u2243\n 0.9, and compressibility, \n\u03bb\n\n\n=\n l \n\u2243\n 3 (where \n\u03bb\n is the slope of the normal compression line), multiple levels of fibres having typical length from \n\u2243\n 1\u20133\u00a0mm to few centimetres, and a degree of saturation often smaller than one, due to biogenic gas entrapment.\n22\n\n,\n\n23\n\n,\n\n26\n\n,\n\n32\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, peats are found consistently in the upper subsoil, especially in the central and western provinces of the country. Geotechnical engineering in these areas is tackled often with simplified approaches, relying on traditional shear strength criteria, or on one-dimensional models for compression and creep. Finite element analyses are run in more delicate cases, typically requiring a soil\u2013structure interaction analysis. In these cases, appropriate constitutive models must be chosen. In the current practice, in the absence of constitutive models specifically developed for peats, available proposals for soft clays are typically adopted,\n33\u201335\n which may result in poor description of the response of these soils at working strain and stress conditions.\nLack of appropriate constitutive models for peats has an impact already on simple limit equilibrium calculations, which suffer from uncertainty in the choice of shear strength parameters, due to the results of laboratory tests being contradictory. Fig.\u00a01 shows data from standard undrained triaxial tests (TxCU, Fig.\u00a01a) and undrained direct simple shear tests (DSS, Fig.\u00a01b) on homogenous natural samples of peat from the Leendert de Boerspolder (NL).\n\nThe comparison between the two data sets suggests a difference of about 10 degrees in the friction angle whether inferred from TxCU or DSS. If the dramatic difference in the friction angle from TxCU and DSS were an intrinsic characteristic of peats, it would imply a non-convex shear strength surface in the deviatoric plane, which could hardly be accepted. Alternatively, it would suggest that an unstable mode of failure is systematically reached in DSS, still in the hardening regime and well below the limit strength surface of the soil. However, data from DSS tests do not show any sign of instability and controllability of the response is never lost.\nThe relevant difference between ultimate shear stress in TxCU and DSS of peats has been consistently observed in previous experimental investigations. In the literature, this difference has been conjectured to come from horizontally aligned fibres, which can stretch in a triaxial stress path and provide additional confinement to the sample, while keep inactive in DSS due to elongation being prevented from null radial displacement. This assumption led to various proposals for correcting triaxial tests data to match DSS ultimate strength, which are schematically displayed in Fig.\u00a02.\nThese include identifying failure with arbitrary thresholds for axial strain \n33\n\n,\n\n36\u201338\n (Fig.\u00a02a), with the phase transition line \n23\n\n,\n\n39\n\n,\n\n40\n (Fig.\u00a02b), with the start of the linear increase in the deviatoric stress after the kink in the stress\u2013strain curve \n41\n\n,\n\n42\n (Fig.\u00a02c), or with the intersection of the tangent to the straight part of the stress path with the tension cut-off (TCO) line \n22\n (Fig.\u00a02d). The rationale behind these suggestions is that the data have to be cleaned from the effects of fibres stretch, if a prudential evaluation of the available shear strength in the field is sought.\nThe previous choices are supported by the following three assumptions on the response of peats: (i) DSS better mimics the deformation mode expected at failure in the field; (ii) the fibres are horizontally aligned, which gives the peat an inherent anisotropic fabric; (iii) no fibres elongation is expected along the stress path mimicked by a DSS test. In reality, all these assumptions can be disputed based on laboratory and field evidence.\n\n\n\n\n2.1\nConstant volume simple shear in the field?\nAt the field scale, it is not proven that the mode of failure of peat layers is simple shearing. On the contrary, field tests on various embankments founded on peat \n35\n\n,\n\n43\u201345\n suggest that lateral bulging is more likely, due to high compressibility of the peat layer and reduced lateral confinement. A recent full scale stress and failure test on a historical dyke, performed at the Leendert de Boerspolder site, north of Leiden in the Netherlands, confirmed that failure in peats may occur with appreciable volume change, with a deformation mode quite different from that expected in a constant volume simple shear test.\n30\n\n\nThe dyke stress test was part of a large research project supported by various provinces and water boards in the Netherlands and financed by the foundation for research on regional dykes, STOWA, and the national Dutch organisation for scientific research, NWO. Details on the test design and monitoring, as well as detailed analyses of the results, are given by De\u00a0Gast\n46\n and Muraro.\n30\n\nFig.\u00a03 sketches the final cross section of the dyke, which was brought to failure by excavating and decreasing the water level at the toe of the original section in steps, until the final rapid drawdown triggered the failure of the system along the schematic mechanism described in the figure.\n\nThe dyke had been instrumented with a number of piezometers, inclinometers and extensometers to track as well as possible the coupled hydro-mechanical response of the system, in the pre-failure and the failure stages (Fig.\u00a04). In Fig.\u00a05, the deformation mode is plotted over the final stage of the test, as reconstructed from relevant inclinometers and extensometers data. The data clearly show that failure in the peat layer was approached with a dominant bulging mode, which is better reproduced in triaxial tests, rather than under DSS constraint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nHorizontally aligned fibres?\n\nFig.\u00a06 shows images of the fabric of peat at various scales. The peat fabric is organised in organic peds composed by partially decomposed leaves, roots and stems together with inorganic sand grains (visible in Fig.\u00a06a and b as white spots). In the fibrous network reconstructed from micro CT scan in Fig.\u00a06c fibres with different orientations and curvatures are visible. The experimental information suggests that, in general, the fibres do not show an initial preferential orientation and that inherent anisotropy might be rather limited in peats.\n\nLack of horizontal alignment also implies that the fibres will be able to stretch over simple shear deformation, in all the directions which are not constrained from zero elongation. Clear evidence of fibres stretching was given by Den\u00a0Haan and Grognet\n47\n on samples tested in a large DSS box and tracked by Particle Image Velocimetry. The results of the analysis, reported in an illustrative on-line video, clearly highlight fibres stretching and pull out along variable directions of the samples, in a more diffused and randomly oriented way than usually assumed.\n\n\n2.3\nEvidence of an anisotropic response?\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a06, peats are made of an organic matrix containing inorganic elements and fibres of different length. These fibres are able to sustain tension, but they become inactive over compression due to bending and warping. To better discuss the evidence of anisotropy on the response of peats, the results of an isotropic compression test are presented. Over isotropic compression, the fibres network is almost inactive and the response of the matrix can be isolated. In addition, isotropic compression is the stress path which better identifies initial anisotropy and its evolution rate at increasing stress.\n48\u201351\n\n\nResults of an isotropic compression test run with standard triaxial equipment with rough end platens are presented in Fig.\u00a07 (details on the tested material are presented in Section\u00a05). In the figure, the inclination of the plastic strain increment vectors, \n\u03b2\n, defined as the ratio between the deviatoric plastic strain increment, \n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nq\n\n\np\n\n\n\n, and the volumetric one, \n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\np\n\n\np\n\n\n\n, is plotted as a function of the mean effective stress. Evidence of initial anisotropy of the peat matrix clearly emerges from the results, due to the predominantly 1D compression state at which the soil had been subjected previously. At increasing stress, the direction of plastic strains rotates towards the isotropic axis. However, closer inspection of the data reveal that the direction of plastic strain vectors overpasses the isotropic axis, with a deviatoric component that seems to increase instead of decreasing at increasing stress, if engineering strains are adopted to elaborate the experimental data.\nThis result could be wrongly interpreted as a proof of a peculiar inherent anisotropy of the soil. Actually, the apparent inclination of the plastic vectors is affected by two interpretation errors, which are not directly related to the material behaviour.\n\nThe first misleading factor is related to the chosen measure of strains. Due to the very high compressibility of the peat, the use of engineering strains is not ideal to properly describe the deformation response of the soil. If the results are re-elaborated using natural strains, the inclination of the plastic strain vectors decreases substantially, although it does not disappear.\nThe result suggests that, in the development of a constitutive approach for peats, the use of natural strains is highly recommended in order to avoid interpretation errors. With reference to axis-symmetric conditions, the volumetric, \n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\np\n\n\n, and deviatoric, \n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nq\n\n\n, strain measures consistently adopted in the following are \n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\np\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\na\n\n\n+\n2\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nr\n\n\n=\nln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nq\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\na\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n=\nln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\nln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\na\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nr\n\n\n are the axial and radial strains, \n\n\nV\n\n\n0\n\n\n and \n\n\nH\n\n\n0\n\n\n are the initial volume and height of the sample, and V and H are the current values. Compressive strains are assumed to be positive.\n\nThe second important reason for the apparent inclination of plastic strain vectors comes from the very strong effects of end restraint given by rough platens and membrane stiffness at the base and the top of the extremely compressible soil samples. Fig.\u00a08a shows the deformed shape of the specimen at the end of an isotropic stress path. Due to end restraint, the total deviatoric strain is not zero, which affects the estimation of the direction of plastic strains. If isotropic compression is repeated with smooth end platens,\n52\n the direction of plastic strains calculated from the global external measurements aligns on the isotropic axis, better revealing an isotropic response of the peat matrix along a purely isotropic stress path, after the initial anisotropy has been cancelled (Fig.\u00a08b). Nonetheless, a small bias still comes from the membrane constraint at the top and the bottom ends.\n\n\n\n3\nExploiting numerical analyses to assess representativeness of standard triaxial tests data\nMost of literature data, from which understanding of the behaviour of peat is derived, come from standard triaxial setup, with rough bases and global measurements on the entire height and volume of the samples. The relevance of boundary effects on the interpretation of the previous isotropic compression test urged for a comprehensive evaluation of the consequences of deriving information on the behaviour of peat from these triaxial tests.\n52\n\n\nA numerical model was setup to simulate the triaxial test as a boundary value problem, including roughness of the base and top cap. Fully coupled hydro-mechanical finite element analyses were run with Abaqus standard \n53\n on an axis-symmetric model having a radius of 19\u00a0mm and a height of 76\u00a0mm. The specimen half cross section was discretised with 1444 8-node biquadratic elements CAX8RP. Controlled axial displacement tests were simulated with the same imposed axial strain rate, \n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\u00a0\n=\n\u00a00.02%\/min, typically used in the experimental tests. The top and bottom boundaries were imposed to be either rough or perfectly smooth, and in the analyses of the deviatoric stress path radial null displacement was imposed on the top and the bottom of the sample over a height of 10\u00a0mm, to account for the kinematic restraint offered by the membrane at the contact with the platens. The top and bottom ends of the specimen were assumed pervious in the simulation of the drained triaxial compression, and impervious in the analysis of the undrained triaxial compression.\nAs a preliminary model for the peat behaviour, a Modified Cam Clay model was adopted, which is often used in the practice, together with the Soft Soil Model, in finite element analyses. The parameters used in the numerical simulations, listed in Table\u00a01, were chosen from a review paper on Dutch peats.\n33\n In the table, \n\u03bb\n is the slope of the normal compression line (NCL), \n\u03ba\n is the slope of the unloading\u2013reloading lines (URL), M is the slope of the critical state line, \n\u03bd\n is the Poisson\u2019s ratio used in the hypo-elastic model, and N* is the reference void ratio for an isotropic stress p\u2019\u00a0\n=\n\u00a01\u00a0kPa on the NCL. Due to the very high compressibility of peats, the hydraulic conductivity, k, may change dramatically over a small stress range. The law used to describe the dependence of the hydraulic conductivity on void ratio was taken from Den Haan & Feddema,\n33\n but it was calibrated on experimental results from a reconstituted peat sample loaded in an oedometer cell with pore pressure transducers (Fig.\u00a09). The hydraulic conductivity \n\n\nk\n\n\n0\n\n\n at the reference void ratio N*, and the parameter ruling the rate of change of hydraulic conductivity with void ratio, \n\n\nC\n\n\nk\n\n\n, are also reported in Table\u00a01.\n\n\nThe results will be presented referring to conventional triaxial variables. The radial and axial stresses are indicated by \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nr\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\na\n\n\n, respectively, with their effective counterparts being \n\u03c3\n\u2019\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n and \n\u03c3\n\u2019\n\n\n\na\n\n\n. The effective isotropic stress, p\u2019, is calculated as (\n\u03c3\n\u2019\n\n\n\na\n\n\n +2\n\u03c3\n\u2019\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\/3, and the deviatoric stress, q, is (\n\u03c3\n\u2019\n\n\n\na\n\n\n - \n\u03c3\n\u2019\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n). Natural strains (Eqs.\u00a0(1) and (2)) have been used consistently in the data elaboration.\n\n3.1\nIsotropic compression\nA simple analysis was performed to replicate the results reported in Fig.\u00a08. The sample was subjected to isotropic compression, either assuming perfectly smooth top and bottom platens or perfectly rough ones. The deformed mesh reported in Fig.\u00a010a resembles the visual observation in Fig.\u00a08a, showing the shear deformational component introduced by the kinematic constraint. In Fig.\u00a010b, the results of the analyses are compared with the previous experimental data and with experimental results from Yamaguchi et al.\n54\n on a similar peat. The numerical results were elaborated from the external quantities (total volume change and total axial displacement) replicating the common practice in the elaboration of laboratory data. The comparison shows that part of the offset between the results and the theoretical isotropic response is due to the effect of end restraint, and not to inherent anisotropy due to fibres orientation, which was advocated by Yamaguchi et\u00a0al.,\n54\n among others, to explain the unusual response. At this stage, it is worth noting that the result does not prove that peats are not anisotropic. Instead, it enlightens that only a careful analysis of the results allows quantifying the effects of material anisotropy, and that the specimen response should not be acritically confused with the evidence of the intrinsic material behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nUndrained deviatoric compression\nThe vast majority of experimental studies on the deviatoric behaviour of peats is performed by means of standard undrained triaxial tests TxCU. Over undrained deviatoric compression, end restraint is expected to play a significant role because the sample needs to expand laterally in order to comply with the constant volume global constraint. Limiting the lateral expansion at the top and bottom will generate spurious shear strains and modify the whole stress and strain states. The expected response is schematically indicated in Fig.\u00a011. If a uniform strain mode were allowed, the resulting excess pore pressure would be uniform over height and in the radial direction, together with the effective radial stress (Fig.\u00a011a). With end restraint, a less deformed zone, named dead wedge in the literature,\n55\n is expected to develop at the bottom and the top of the specimen. In spite of closed drainage at the ends, pressure gradient will be generated inside the specimen, which will slowly equalise depending on the hydraulic conductivity, allowing for local volumetric strain. The excess pore water pressure at the base is expected to be higher than that at mid height of the sample (Fig.\u00a011b). These effects are expected to introduce an error on the apparent stress path of the sample, if this is calculated based on the global available external measures.\n\nTo demonstrate the interpretation error in elaborating data from standard undrained triaxial compression, a deviatoric stress path was simulated, including rough end platens and radial displacement restraint over a 10\u00a0mm height (from visual detection during the experimental tests). The results of the numerical analysis are shown in Fig.\u00a012. In Fig.\u00a012a the isotropic effective stress and deviatoric stress at the bottom of the sample over the radius of the specimen are compared to the values derived from the external measurements (global quantities).\n\nThe results clearly indicate that the elaboration from global measurements both underestimates the isotropic effective stress p\u2019 and overestimates the deviatoric stress q. The difference reduces to a large extent if reference is made to the distribution at mid height of the specimen (Fig.\u00a012b), although some bias still remain, especially at its outer boundary. As a consequence of these non-uniformities, the excess pore pressure at the bottom of the specimen, where standard pore pressure transducers are connected, is higher than that at the centre of the specimen, where the effects of end restraint are smaller (Fig.\u00a012c). The consequence of using a pore pressure transducer connected to the bottom of the sample, and evaluating strains and stresses from global measurements is highlighted in Fig.\u00a012d by the difference between the expected and the estimated ultimate stress ratio, with the latter clearly overestimating the shear strength of the soil.\nThe deformed shape of the specimen at 20% axial strain, reported in Fig.\u00a013a, shows the influence of end restraint on the strain mode and the pore pressure gradient. Lateral bulging of the central portion of the specimen produces a non-equalised pore pressure gradient over the volume of the sample. The deformed shape of a peat specimen sheared in undrained condition with rough end platens is shown in Fig.\u00a013b for comparison. In spite of the absence of external drainage, local volumetric strains compensating each other are allowed during the compression stage, which was demonstrated experimentally by the non-uniform final profile of water content detected on the tested samples.\n56\n\n\n\nIn Fig.\u00a014a, the apparent stress path, calculated with global external measurements is compared to the theoretical one. Smooth platens obviously guarantee better observation of the material response in the triaxial test, however, reasonable information could be deduced too from standard tests with rough end platens, provided the pore pressure were measured at mid height of the sample. On the contrary, with pore pressure measurement at the bottom, besides substantial overestimation of the shear strength, a dramatic error in plotting the entire stress path is introduced, which is exacerbated by the radial constraint introduced at the bottom and top ends of the specimen. The error propagates in the evaluation of the deformation mode, which requires to be carefully evaluated in the development of constitutive approaches. \n52\n\n\nIn Fig.\u00a014b, the difference is shown from the experimental results on two identical samples of reconstituted peat tested with smooth and rough platens, respectively. Although the trend of the difference is similar to the theoretical one, a dramatic change in the ultimate shear stress ratio can also be appreciated, which cannot be reproduced approaching the material behaviour with a MCC type model, and requires a more advanced modelling approach. An operative criterion to correct data from standard triaxial tests and obtain reasonable values for either the friction angle or the undrained shear strength was discussed recently by Muraro & Jommi,\n56\n in an attempt to re-establish the usefulness of standard triaxial tests on peats in the engineering practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nSummary of experimental findings underpinning an elastic\u2013plastic constitutive approach\nTo start filling the gap between engineering needs and currently available models, an extensive experimental programme was performed on reconstituted samples of peat. The choice for reconstituted samples was motivated by the need for repeatable sets of tests, on which the main features of the material behaviour could be investigated. The samples were collected at the Leendert de Boerspolder to support the design and the interpretation of the stress test. The entire experimental investigation is reported by Muraro,\n30\n and has been discussed in previous works together with the criteria for the development of the constitutive approach.\n32\n\n,\n\n52\n\n,\n\n56\n\n,\n\n57\n Details on the soil classification, triaxial equipment and testing protocols can be found in Jommi et al.\n32\n and Muraro & Jommi.\n56\n\n\nIn the following, a brief summary of selected results is presented, which guided the development of a constitutive framework for peat. A strain hardening elastic\u2013plastic approach was chosen, although different approaches have been also proposed in the last years.\n27\n\n,\n\n28\n\n,\n\n58\u201360\n The choice for strain hardening elastoplasticity allows for relevant aspects of the soil behaviour response, which are worthwhile considering in the development of models for peats, to be identified and introduced step by step in the constitutive framework. The tests were conducted with standard commercial triaxial cells, which were not equipped yet with local sensors. Smooth end platens were installed, based on the results of the previous evaluation, to quantify the influence of rough platens on the experimental results and limit elaboration errors in the development of the constitutive model. Both undrained and drained tests were performed, with multiple combination of stress paths including standard TxCU, radial paths, constant p\u2019 and constant q stress paths, to broaden the experimental investigation as much as possible, though limited to axis-symmetric conditions.\n\n4.1\nShear strength\nMuraro and Jommi\n56\n presented a systematic experimental investigation to quantify the effects of end restraint in the observed shear strength of peat tested with standard triaxial apparatus. Samples with different height to diameter ratio, H\/D, were used and the results from tests run with rough and smooth end platens were compared to each other.\n\nThe results in Fig.\u00a015 quantify the end restraint effects on overestimating the shear strength of peat. The increase of deviatoric stress at failure (Fig.\u00a015a) is due both to the shear stresses at the rough ends and to the higher excess pore pressure measured at the bottom of the samples. Both effects contribute to overestimating the ultimate friction angle (Fig.\u00a015b). The overestimation for a sample with a standard ratio \n\n\nH\n\n\n0\n\n\n\/D\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n\n\u00a02 tested with rough end platens is about 11\u00b0, with the friction angle passing from \n\u03c6\n\u2019\u00a0\n=\n\u00a043\u00b0 to \n\u03c6\n\u2019\u00a0\n=\n\u00a054\u00b0. The limitation of the triaxial setup can be partly addressed by using higher \n\n\nH\n\n\n0\n\n\n\/D\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n ratios, although for H\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\/D\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n higher than 2.5 the samples are likely to fail by geometrical instability. The results in Fig.\u00a015 suggest a coherent picture of the shear strength of peat, explain the paradigmatic discrepancy between the shear strength parameters traditionally obtained from triaxial and direct simple shear apparatuses (Fig.\u00a01), and indicate an acceptable shape of the shear strength surface of peats in the deviatoric plane.\n\n\n4.2\nYield surface\nThe shape of the yield locus in the meridian plane of the tested peat was investigated by Muraro and Jommi\n57\n by means of multiple radial stress paths. To determine the onset of yielding, different stress\u00a0\u2013\u00a0strain and energy criteria were employed.\n61\n\n,\n\n62\n The trace of the yield locus in the p\u2019\u00a0\u2013\u00a0q space is displayed in Fig.\u00a016.\n\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a016, the experimental yield points seem to suggest a shape of yield locus for the tested peat slightly below the traditional Modified Cam clay. The expression proposed by McDowell and Hau\n63\n can be used to interpolate the experimental point with \n\n\nM\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u00a0\n=\n\u00a01.5 and \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u00a0\n=\n\u00a03.0 (see the Appendix).\n\n\n4.3\nPlastic potential\nMuraro and Jommi\n52\n presented a dedicated investigation on the stress-dilatancy rule, in which the bias introduced by end restraint on the deformation mechanism of peat samples in the triaxial apparatus is overcome by means of a combination of numerical analysis and practical suggestions. The experimental data from drained isotropic compression, \n\n\nK\n\n\n0\n\n\n consolidation path (S-\n\n\nK\n\n\n0\n\n\n) and undrained deviatoric compression (S-U) were combined to derive the shape of the stress\u00a0- dilatancy relationship for the tested peat (Fig.\u00a017). The expression proposed by McDowell and Hau\n63\n was adopted to interpolate the experimental data, with a stress ratio at critical state \n\n\nM\n\n\ng\n\n\n\u00a0\n=\n\u00a01.75, corresponding to \n\u03c6\n\u2019\u00a0\n=\n\u00a043\u00b0 (Fig.\u00a015b) and a shape coefficient \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\ng\n\n\n\u00a0\n=\n\u00a00.98. The latter was derived imposing zero lateral strain along the \n\n\nK\n\n\n0\n\n\n path determined experimentally.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4\nHardening law\nInformation on the hardening law for peats is scarce. Muraro and Jommi\n57\n recently presented experimental results showing that purely volumetric hardening is not adequate to describe the deviatoric response of peat. Stress paths along different radial directions were conducted to determine the evolution of the pre-consolidation mean effective stress, p\u2019\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n, with plastic strains. In Fig.\u00a018, the evolution of p\u2019\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n, normalised with its value at the onset of plastic strains, is reported for the radial stress paths investigated.\n\n\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a018a, the relevance of the deviatoric component of plastic strains increases with the stress ratio. If, for the sake of simplicity, a simple linear combination of volumetric and deviatoric plastic strains is proposed (with D\u00a0\n=\n\u00a00.95 being an empirical coefficient), the experimental data better align on a unique line (Fig.\u00a018b). Based on the results in Fig.\u00a018, a generalised volumetric and deviatoric hardening law already proposed for granular soils \n64\n was adopted for the tested peat.\nThe set of experimental results summarised above allowed deriving the ingredients that a simple elastic\u00a0-\u00a0plastic model for peats should contain, and formulating a simple constitutive model. The predictive capabilities and the limitations of the model were tested on a number of combined stress paths and discussed by Muraro & Jommi.\n57\n For the sake of completeness, a summary of the model equations is given in\u00a0Appendix.\n\n\n\n5\nNatural versus reconstituted peat\nAn obvious question remains on whether the modelling approach designed on reconstituted peats will also work for natural peats. Natural peats tend to have a different\u00a0\u2013\u00a0more aggregated\u00a0\u2013\u00a0fabric than reconstituted ones, and typically contain longer and bigger fibres, in addition to the small fibres network which is present in the reconstituted samples.\n31\n To investigate the differences in the deviatoric response of natural peats compared to reconstituted ones, and to assess to what extent the previous constitutive framework could equally apply to natural peats, few triaxial tests on natural samples coming from the subsoil of the Markemeer dykes at Katwoude \n65\n were examined. The average physical characteristics of the peat from Katwoude are compared to those of the peat from the Leendert de Boerspolder in Table\u00a02, which shows the similarity in the composition of the two materials. To visualise the differences, pictures of the two peats are reported in Fig.\u00a019. The size of the natural specimens was 50\u00a0mm in diameter and 100\u00a0mm in height, which assured the representativeness of the tested volume following the results of Ang and Loehr\n66\n on samples of silty clay and Yamaguchi et al.\n67\n on samples of a similar peat.\n\nIt is relevant to note that the tests on natural peat samples presented in this section had been run for commercial purposes with rough end platens, before the effects of end restraint became evident. Therefore, the stress\u2013strain curves and the stress paths elaborated from these tests should not be confused with the true response of the material, due to the influence of the experimental setup. To overcome this difficulty, the comparison between natural and reconstituted peat is made with reference to samples all tested in the same equipment with rough end platens. The implication of this choice is shown in Fig.\u00a020, in which the stress path followed by a natural peat sample over the deviatoric stage of a standard undrained compression test, TxCU, is superposed to the results from two samples of reconstituted peat tested with smooth and rough end platens. As discussed before, the effect of rough end platens increases with the stress ratio, giving an apparent shear strength higher than the true shear strength of the material. As a consequence, the parameters used in the simulations, are not the true material parameters calibrated for the reconstituted peat,\n57\n but are re-calibrated to fit the apparent results. The index properties and relevant information on the whole set of data used are reported in Table\u00a03, where \n\n\ne\n\n\n0\n\n\n and p\u20190 are the void ratio and the effective mean stress at the start of deviatoric compression.\n\n\nThe normalised stress paths in Fig.\u00a021a of the five samples investigated starting from normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated states are quite consistent. Normalised stress variables were obtained from the maximum pre-consolidation mean effective stress, p\u2019\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n. The reconstituted peat samples fail for a stress ratio of about 2.3, which approximately coincides with the condition \n\u03b4\np\u2019\u00a0\n=\n\u00a00 on the natural peat samples (point A). The natural peat samples overpass this stress ratio, with a stress path approaching asymptotically the TCO line, where the effective radial stress becomes zero. Adopting the definition of Oikawa & Miyakawa,\n39\n for stress ratios \n\u03b7\n\u00a0>\u00a0\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\np\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n, natural peat samples exhibit a \u201cnew specimen dynamics\u201d, with further increments in the deviatoric stress accompanied by dilation. To clarify the transition from contractive to dilatant response, Fig.\u00a021b reports the pore pressure parameter, a, \n62\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\na\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\np\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\nq\n\n\n\n\n\nfor the two samples 1-R and 1-N, which are almost normally consolidated. The trend of the two samples is similar, with the reconstituted sample approaching an apparent critical ultimate state. The ultimate failure stress ratio of the reconstituted sample marks the transition between the contractive (a\u00a0>\u00a00) and the dilatant response (a\u00a0<\u00a00) of the natural sample, which continues approaching the TCO.\n\nThe normalised deviatoric stress\u2013strain response of the same two samples, 1-R and 1-N, are compared in Fig.\u00a022. The stress\u2013strain curves are very similar to each other until a deviatoric strain of approximately 10%, after which the reconstituted sample asymptotically reaches a peak. On the contrary, the natural sample starts hardening at a linear rate at increasing deviatoric stress.\n\nSeveral previous works have attributed this peculiar linear strain hardening behaviour to the additional confinement offered by fibres stretch (Yamaguchi et al.\n26\n; Cola and Cortellazzo\n68\n; Hendry et\u00a0al.,\n42\n among others). However, including this feature of the behaviour in a constitutive model has seldom be attempted for peats, with the exceptions of Molenkamp\n69\n proposing an overlay model concept (followed by Teunissen & Zwanenburg,\n70\n), and Boumezerane et al.\n60\n approaching the problem by means of a generic fabric tensor. Referring more in general to fibre-reinforced soils, several proposals have been reported in the literature. Among them, it is worthwhile mentioning the work on reinforced sands by Diambra et\u00a0al.,\n71\n\n,\n\n72\n Diambra and Ibraim\n73\n and Gao and Diambra\n74\n who integrated the previous two concepts in a unified model.\n\n5.1\nAn (over)simplified approach: simulating natural peats with the model developed for reconstituted peats\nModelling of the experimental data was first attempted in a simplified way, trying not to include explicitly further ingredients and parameters besides the ones included in the formulation for reconstituted peats, and keeping it simple for practical implementation. In other words, the modelling approach developed for reconstituted peats (presented in the previous section and detailed in the Appendix) was calibrated again to fit the response of the fibrous natural peat as a homogeneous soil. A best fit for the parameters is reported in Table\u00a04, and the comparison between the chosen best fit and the experimental data is presented in Fig.\u00a023. It is worth reminding that these parameters are not characterising the true material response, due to the bias in the experimental data given by the experimental setup. Nonetheless, this is not a conceptual limitation, as the scope of the simulation is to probe the model for its ability to capture qualitatively the response of natural sample.\nIt could be concluded that the approach is good enough to model the data up to strain levels around 20% (Fig.\u00a023a, b). However, the correct trend of the excess pore pressure is lost before. While the experimental data show increasing pressure over the entire test, the high dilatancy introduced in the model to replicate the experimental stress path is responsible for the decreasing trend of the pore pressure approaching failure in undrained conditions. Similar mismatch is observed in the trend of the stress ratio.\n\n\nAlthough the quantitative differences seem small, and would push towards a tentative acceptance of this type of approach, the qualitatively wrong response is activating an alarm on the consistency of the model with the physical behaviour of the sample.\n\n\n5.2\nA simple proposal: extending the model developed for reconstituted peats to natural peats\nA more reliable modelling approach can be set up if the network of small fibres, included in the reconstituted samples of peat, is split from the bigger fibres which typically characterise natural peat samples (Fig.\u00a024). The volume fraction, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nf\n\n\n, of the latter can be determined by sieving.\n30\n\n\n\nAdopting a simple homogenisation approach, the stress state of the composite, \n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n, can be derived from the stress state of the soil matrix, \n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n, and that of the fibres \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n by a volumetric averaging approach \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nm\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nf\n\n\n are the matrix and the fibres volume fractions, respectively, with \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n=\n\u00a01\u00a0-\u00a0\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nf\n\n\n.

In the absence of direct information on the stiffness of the specific fibres, the latter was calibrated by back-analysis on the results of the triaxial tests. The back-calculated stiffness, which fitted the stress\u2013strain curves, was at least one order of magnitude smaller than the one expected from experimental tests performed on fibres of similar diameter by Trivellato.\n75\n The result suggested that slippage between the matrix and big natural fibres cannot be disregarded in the interpretation and in the modelling of the results.\nTo address the possibility for slippage in a simplified way, a contact efficiency was introduced, as suggested by Diambra et al.\n72\n The fibres strain can be inferred from the composite total strain by means of a reduction factor, \n\n\nK\n\n\ne\n\n\n, which accounts for slippage, and as a function of the confining stress \n\n(7)\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\nK\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\nref\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere p\u2019\n\n\n\nref\n\n\n is an arbitrary reference stress. In the implementation, p\u2019\n\n\n\nref\n\n\n\u00a0\n=\n\u00a0100\u00a0kPa was used.\n\n\nThe stiffness of the fibres was fixed to \n\n\n\nE\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\n 1\u00a0MPa, based on the results by Trivellato,\n75\n and the contact efficiency was calibrated to fit the experimental results. The parameters used in the simulation of the test are listed in Table\u00a05. It is worth reminding once more that the chosen parameters are just a best fit for the data presented in Fig.\u00a025 and are biased by the effects of end restraint. Moreover, it is expected that the actual distribution of the orientation of the fibres will be one of the relevant controlling factors in the response at the field scale, as demonstrated by various works on fibre reinforced sands (among them, \n76\n). Therefore, the model has no predictive capabilities at this stage, however, the conceptual approach can be used for a qualitative evaluation.\nIn Fig.\u00a025, the dotted lines represent the contribution of the fibrous peat matrix to the response, while the continuous lines show the response of the composite material. The comparison between the numerical predictions and the experimental results shown in Fig.\u00a025 clarifies that the mismatch between the numerical and the experimental trends of the pore pressure and the stress ratio at high strains (Fig.\u00a023c, d), resulting from the use of a simple continuum model, can be explained as the explicit contribution of big fibres to the external response of the composite material. Fig.\u00a025c, d are especially explanatory in this respect. The excess pore pressure of the composite material overall increases, although the dilatant rule used allows the peat matrix excess pore pressure to decrease (Fig.\u00a025c). This is also the case for the composite stress ratio (Fig.\u00a025d), which can increases towards the TCO line, in spite of the peat matrix having reached its ultimate strength.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nPeats and fibrous organic fine grained soils are challenging from the constitutive modelling perspective due to some concomitant factors, which have hindered the development of comprehensive modelling frameworks. Contradictory experimental results have been tackled in the past in a rather empirical way, typically bringing to over-conservative approaches in the engineering practice. Advancing the understanding and the modelling of these soils will help in better addressing geotechnical solutions in soft deltaic areas and reducing the associated costs. To this aim, a combined experimental, theoretical and numerical effort was started at TU Delft, which could explain the physical reason for apparently inconsistent results, and underpin the development of a possible modelling framework, which includes present knowledge and traces a possible path towards future developments.\nThe experimental tests highlighted that well known defects of standard triaxial equipment are exacerbated when testing peats, because of their unique combination of extremely high compressibility and shear strength. Rough end platens and membrane restraint effects were found to be responsible for the large difference in ultimate shear strength detected from triaxial and simple shear tests. If the end restraint is limited by the use of smooth platens, experimental data provide a consistent picture of peat response. Also, the results indicate that the distributed network of small fibres in the peat matrix is seldom preferentially oriented, and will equally play a role in any deformation mode, including simple shear.\nRough platens and membrane restraint effects bias the entire stress paths and the strain measures derived from global external measurements. This aspect does not hinder the use of standard triaxial data in the characterisation of peats, but strongly suggests that the data must be carefully elaborated to derive model parameters from raw data. This becomes evident when analysing the response of a peat specimen in the triaxial equipment as a boundary value problem, rather than a perfect test on a material sample. Numerical analyses are extremely valuable in this respect, and they can be used as an aid to assist data interpretation from tests run with non-optimal equipment setup. For various reasons, including proper tracking the deformation of the fibres network, finite kinematics is recommended in the analysis of the data, to avoid introducing unnecessary bias in the interpretation.\nLimiting the attention to an elastic\u2013plastic framework, the results collected on reconstituted peat samples indicated that two ingredients, namely non-associated plastic flow and a hardening law depending on both deviatoric and volumetric plastic strains, are rather crucial features of peats, which had been seldom considered in the past. The transition from peats through organic clays towards soft clays is continuous. Therefore, it is not surprising that some of the general markers of the response of peats are shared with the broader category of soft clays.\nAnisotropy is one of these markers. However, the true anisotropic response of peats can be identified only after spurious effects from the test setup have been cleaned for. The results collected suggest that the fibrous matrix including small fibres, typically few millimetres long, is not inherently anisotropic, but will suffer from induced anisotropy depending on the stress and strain history of the soil. On the contrary, when natural peats contain bigger and longer fibres, these may have a preferential orientation due to the formation environment of the material.\nIncluding these big fibres in a homogenous model is not unfeasible; however, this might be not an ideal approach. A more effective constitutive approach can be developed if the distribution of the initial orientation of big fibres is explicitly introduced, and a finite kinematics approach is adopted to accurately follow the fibres deformation modes, their stretch and their interaction with the peat matrix.\n\nLIST OF SYMBOLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n0s\n\n\n\n\nundisturbed water

tremendous leap forward, thanks to a number of major technological advances along with a matching computational power. Besides the development of new and powerful tools (e.g., Broad Ion Beaming (BIB),\n1\n rheography,\n2\n) a number of techniques which had been well established in domains neighbouring that of geomechanics have permeated into soil and rock mechanics. Some notable examples are nanoindentation\u00a0\n3\n and diffraction.\n4\u20136\n Non-contact measurement techniques, which over the last two decades have passed from relatively niche to well-established tools (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a07, 8) are of particular interest. Such techniques are often referred to as full-field, in contrast to more conventional \u201cpoint-wise\u201d or \u201cbulk-averaged\u201d measurement techniques, which are based on the use of transducers positioned at the specimen boundaries. In conventional material testing, in fact, the measured response can at best be seen to represent an overall, averaged material response.\nConsequently, only in the case of a perfectly homogeneous material undergoing perfectly uniform deformation, the response measured from the test will reflect the true material (i.e., constitutive) behaviour. Geomaterials are never perfectly homogeneous at the scale of a laboratory specimen, nor are boundary conditions perfectly applied. Furthermore, even when starting from \u201cperfectly\u201d homogeneous conditions, processes (e.g., deformation) can eventually localise into more or less narrow zones (shear and compaction bands, tensile and shear cracks or fractures) at some stage of a test. In the presence of localised strains, it is clear that the meaning of stress and strain variables derived from boundary measurements of loads and displacements is only nominal, or conventional.\nMeasuring a strain field within a specimen is therefore the only way in which test results can be appropriately interpreted. A number of full-field techniques (thermal, wave-based, optical) have been\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and are being\u00a0\u2013\u00a0used in laboratory testing of soil and rock: ultrasonic tomography (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a09, 10), electrical resistivity tomography (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a011, 12), magnetic resonance imaging (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a013\u201315), infrared thermography (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a016\u201318)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to mention but a few. A remarkable example is represented by the techniques based on ionising radiation: X-rays and neutrons.\nX-ray attenuation is a function of atomic number and density. Conversely neutrons interact with the nuclei. Due to different interactions with matter, neutrons attenuation of light elements such as hydrogen (and its compounds such as water and hydrocarbons) and lithium is several orders of magnitude higher than their X-ray attenuation. Furthermore, metals such as aluminium and titanium are hand far more transparent to neutrons than to X-rays, facilitating the construction of in-operando testing apparatus for high confinement pressures. These are but a few of the advantages of neutrons, which will be explored in this paper and whose potential in geomechanics has so far been only partially exploited\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which may perhaps be explained by its comparative rarity.\nTo a recent estimate \n19\n\n,\n\n20\n, in fact, several tens of thousands of X-ray tomographs are available (including medical, industrial and for scientific purposes). This is to be compared to the few tens of neutron tomographs available worldwide.\n21\n One of the aims of this paper is to highlight how neutron imaging, despite its limited availability, lends itself as the ideal measurement tool for a number of open scientific problems.\nX-rays have established themselves as a reference technique for the non invasive study of micro-mechanical processes in geomechanics such as grain rearrangement (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a022\u201328), crushing (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a029\u201335) and creep\u00a0\n36\n in sands, deformation of rocks (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a037\u201342), cracking of concrete (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a043\u201345) to mention but a few. This is matched by a number of dedicated conferences (e.g., ICTMS \u2013formerly GeoX and 3DIMS\u2013, iCT) and topical reviews (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a08, 46\u201348).\nPrevious review papers on neutron imaging are quite broad in scope: from the history of neutron imaging\u00a0\n49\n to the more recent advances,\n50\n\n,\n\n51\n the implications of higher resolutions,\n52\n those focusing on advanced techniques\u00a0\n53\n (e.g., energy selective, grating interferometry, polarised neutrons) and those exploring their complementarity to X-rays.\n54\n Comparatively few and relatively old review papers focus on neutron imaging for the geosciences, to study the chemical composition and fluid flow in porous materials.\n55\n\n,\n\n56\n In 2014\u00a0\n57\n an extensive review focused specifically on permeability studies in porous media and will be used as a starting point in Section\u00a03.2. Hereafter, we will focus on the more recent developments of neutron imaging, in particular those that are most relevant for the mechanics of (i.e., deformation processes in) geomaterials.\nWhen talking about neutrons as a form of ionising radiation, a natural parallel is with the better known X-rays. This parallel between the two techniques for imaging will be maintained across the paper in the hope of aiding the readers more familiar with the latter.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: The following section gives an overview of the fundamentals of neutron imaging and its historical developments. Section\u00a03 provides an overview of the recent developments within the context of geomechanics, starting with a historical overview (Section\u00a03.1). One of the broader applications is fluid flow in geomaterials, which is outlined in Section\u00a03.2; its converse (drying) is discussed in Section\u00a03.3. Testing at extreme conditions (Section\u00a03.4) is another relevant application, albeit many other unique contrast mechanisms of neutrons can be exploited (Section\u00a03.5). A notable new development is the capability to acquire X-ray and neutron images simultaneously, as discussed in Section\u00a04. The paper concludes with a review of the impact of these techniques on geomechanics as well as with some foreseen avenues of future developments. It should be noted that in this work we adopt the broader definition of geomaterials, which besides soils and rocks also includes concrete\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which can be seen as (and behaves like) a strongly bonded rock. In fact from a mechanics standpoint, soils, rock and concrete behave essentially in the same way, and their difference \u201conly lies in the application\u201d.\n58\n\n\n\n\n2\nElements of neutron imaging\nNeutrons were discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick, while trying to understand the origin of the theoretical imbalance of the energy necessary to contain the electrons in the atom, which could not be justified by the protons alone. This discovery came nearly four decades after the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen in 1895.\n\n2.1\nInteraction with matter\nUnlike X-rays, neutrons interact with the nucleus of the atom, which is why they are sensitive to the different isotopes of matter.\n59\n A relevant example is provided by hydrogen and deuterium: they are both composed by one proton and one electron, but the latter also contains a neutron in its nucleus. As a result, their interaction with neutrons is an order of magnitude different, while being chemically and physically similar. Like X-rays, neutrons interact with matter in a variety of ways, but the dominant ones, in the context of geomaterials, are scattering and absorption. X-ray attenuation increases proportionally with (the fourth power of) the atomic number of the material, as highlighted in Fig.\u00a01, where the grey value for each element represents its opacity to X-rays. From the same figure, it is clear that the neutron interaction is far less monotonic. One interesting example is hydrogen (and its compounds, such as water and hydrocarbons), which weakly attenuates X-rays while being highly opaque to neutrons. Similar considerations can be made for some salts (e.g., the Chlorine in NaCl is highly visible) or lithium (for battery applications). Conversely, metals such as Lead or Gold are far more transparent to neutrons than to X-rays. A relevant example of neutron transparent metals are aluminium or titanium, which makes them ideal to build sample environments imposing extreme conditions (e.g., high pressure) on realistic-size samples without affecting the outcome of the imaging experiment.\nBesides the aforementioned sensitivity to light elements, and transparency to metals and isotope sensitivity, neutrons are also generally far less invasive than X-rays in terms of radiation damage.\n59\n Typical energies for X-ray imaging are in fact in the tens of keV to be compared to the meV energy range for neutrons used in imaging applications. While in most geomechanical applications radiation damage is of limited influence to the representativity of the material response (far more so for biological samples), it is important to notice that high brilliance X-rays, and notably in synchrotron sources, can noticeably heat up fluids such as water (and even change the wetting angle, e.g., \u00a0Ref.\u00a060) or kill biological cells, which can be more consequential in some applications.\n61\n\n,\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nAttenuation law\nAttenuation (i.e., scattering plus absorption) of the neutron beam intensity I (in neutrons per unit area and time) along an axis z for a monochromatic (single wavelength) beam, passing through a homogeneous sample can be expressed through the Beer\u2013Lambert law as: \n\n(1)\n\n\nI\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n=\n\n\nI\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03bc\nz\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nI\n\n\n0\n\n\n is the initial beam intensity, \n\u03bc\n the coefficient of linear absorption and z the sample thickness along the beam direction. This law can be generalised for a polychromatic beam traversing a sample comprising n different \u201clayers\u201d as: \n\n(2)\n\n\nI\n=\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nz\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n(\n\u03bb\n)\n\n\n\nd\n\u03bb\n\n\n\nwith \n\n\nz\n\n\ni\n\n\n being the thickness of the layer i. The corresponding coefficient of linear absorption \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ni\n\n\n can be expressed as: \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n(\n\u03bb\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n(\n\u03bb\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n(\n\u03bb\n)\n\n\n is the cross section of element i, \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ni\n\n\n its density, M the molar weight, and \n\n\nN\n\n\nA\n\n\n is Avogadro\u2019s constant. It is evident that this law is wavelength dependent. For example, the attenuation coefficient of water \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n for a thermal (1.54\u00c5) and cold (9\u00c5) beam is 5.62 and 7.55cm\u22121, respectively.\n57\n It follows that to be truly quantitative this technique strongly benefits from a monochromatic beam. Nonetheless, given the already limited neutron flux at most facilities, and the fact that monochromation comes at the cost of a significantly reduced flux, this approach is rarely employed. Of particular interest in this case are pulsed sources (which will be introduced in the next section). When careful synchronisation between the pulse and the imaging system is established, in fact, time-resolved imaging can coincide with energy-resolved imaging: the first neutrons in a pulse to arrive to the detector are the faster and higher-energy ones, and, vice-versa, the last, slower ones are the those with a higher wavelength e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a066, 67. While the absolute quantification of elements such as water suffers from this variation in attenuation in polychromatic beams, some of this error can be corrected a-posteriori.\nThe Beer\u2013Lambert law is generally employed to describe attenuation for both X-rays and neutrons. This 1D approximation describes the absorption of the ionising radiation but it does not, in its strictest definition, account for other processes at play such as diffraction and refraction. When scattering is a significant component of the attenuation, then a non negligible fraction of the scattered radiation can hit the detector, causing a deviation from this law. This is of course more pronounced when we have large amounts of scattering (e.g., for neutrons in the presence of large amounts of water) as well as when the object is very close to the detector (which unfortunately is essential in order to achieve high resolutions in realistic times). To account for this effect, two approaches can be broadly followed: limitation and correction. It is of course possible to limit studies to low water amounts (hydrogen being a strong incoherent \u201cscatterer\u201d, as opposed to for example lithium where absorption is the predominant attenuation process); Refs.\u00a068, 69 indicated that in some cases, errors due to secondary scattering could be higher than 40% for water thicknesses of 4mm. Several methods have been proposed to correct this errors, some based on some statistical or a-priori modelling\u00a0\n68\u201372\n and some on direct measurements.\n73\u201375\n\n\nThese scattering-induced errors are not unique to neutrons but in the specific case of water they are particularly important, justifying the extensive attention dedicated to it in the literature. The tomographic acquisition, reconstruction and data processing algorithms developed for X-rays and neutrons are otherwise identical, as further detailed in Section\u00a02.6.\n\n\n2.3\nNeutron sources\nNeutrons are fundamental particles which have mass (unlike photons such as X-rays) and, as the name suggests, carry no electric charge. One of the most common ways to produce neutrons is through nuclear fission, e.g., by bombarding with one neutron an Uranium 235 atom, which splits into a Barium and a Krypton atom plus three neutrons, with a net gain of two neutrons and about 180MeV of energy.\nAlternatively, spallation can be adopted: protons are magnetically accelerated to \n\u2248\n96% of the light speed (around 1GeV) onto a heavy metal target (e.g., lead, mercury, tantalum) which releases about 20 to 30 neutrons per nucleus. This is generally a far more costly way of producing neutron beams and the beam has a \u201cpulsed\u201d nature (which can be used to distinguish the faster, more energetic neutrons from the slower ones).\nThe energy of neutrons is in both cases usually too high for imaging purposes, which is why they are typically slowed down by making them pass through \u201cmoderators\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0often hydrogen or hydrogenous materials at low temperatures. Analogously to how X-rays are often divided in higher and lower energy subcategories, respectively named hard and soft, neutrons are rather loosely assigned to bands of energies associated with characteristic moderator temperatures. For imaging purposes generally cold and thermal neutrons are used, the colder ones being less energetic and therefore having lower penetration power but allowing higher contrast.\nProducing neutrons generally requires large-scale nuclear reactors (e.g., Institut Laue-Langevin, ILL, in France, the Neutron Beam Split-Core Reactor at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NBSR-NIST, in the USA and Technische Universitat Munchen, TUM, in Germany) or spallation sources (e.g., European Spallation Source, ESS, in Sweden \u2013 under construction \u2013 and Paul Scherrer Institut, PSI, in Switzerland), whereas laboratory sources are still too low flux to be useful for most applications. A selection of the more prominent neutron imaging facilities and some of their key features is given in Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a02.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\nDetection and collimation\nFor imaging applications, both X-rays and neutrons are usually detected by employing special chemical compounds, named \u201cscintillators\u201d; these are luminescent materials that, when excited by an incident ionising radiation, re-emit the absorbed energy in the form of (visible) light. This light can then be captured by a scientific imaging detector, which generally has a cooled chip to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, such as charge-coupled devices (CCD), Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors (CMOS) or amorphous silicon detectors. There are different varieties of scintillation compounds but, for those used in most neutron imaging applications, the thicker scintillators generally yield more light but a lower resolution. Additional optical focusing elements are often employed to achieve virtual pixel sizes better suited to the application at hand.\nWhile in laboratory X-ray scanners the generated beam is usually conical (i.e., divergent), neutron beams are sub-parallel, with a beam divergence of generally less than one degree and mostly a few tenths of a degree. Conical beams have the advantage that the resolution\/field of view can be modified geometrically by adjusting the relative distance between the sample and the source\/detector and that the more efficient \u201cflat-panel\u201d type detector can be employed. Parallel beams generally require additional optical components to vary the resolution. In many types of neutron detectors, the camera is mounted on a rail allowing the variation of its distance from the scintillator, to modify the field of view. Multiple lenses (generally having a fixed focal length, because of their higher optical quality and efficiency) are typically available at neutron beamlines, and the combination of camera\/scintillator distance, lens chosen and camera pixel size determines the field of view. In some kinds of high-resolution detectors, a combination of fixed lenses is employed to maximise the optical efficiency at the cost of the loss of variability of the field of view (e.g., for infinity corrected optics-based detectors.\n83\n)\nFor static measurements (i.e., excluding motion blurring), two categories of features influence the resolution: the detector system unsharpness, i.e., detector details such as pixel size, optics and scintillation, as noted above, and the geometric unsharpness. This identifies the loss of resolution caused by the slight conicity of the neutron beam. This effect is limited by moving the object closer to the detector, moving away the source and limiting its size (e.g., employing an aperture\/pinhole). The object\u2013detector distance, generally identified as l, reduces the geometrical unsharpness at the cost of an increased fraction of scattered neutron impacting the detector. On the other hand lower apertures D and higher aperture-object distance L decrease the geometric unsharpness at the cost of reduced flux (decreasing with the square of both), see Fig.\u00a02. The loss of spatial resolution induced by geometrical unsharpness \n\n\nU\n\n\ng\n\n\n is then given by (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a084, 85): \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nU\n\n\ng\n\n\n=\nl\n\u2215\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, higher beam collimation (L\/D) allow for achieving higher resolutions but at the cost of lower flux and therefore longer exposure times as highlighted in Fig.\u00a02. Most beamlines allow for a variety of pinholes to be used and often have multiple stations at varying distances from these apertures.\n\n\n2.5\nFrom radiography to tomography\nThe elements detailed in the previous sections (sources, collimators, and detectors) allow acquiring two-dimensional projections of the attenuation to neutrons\/X-rays of the object, named radiographies in both cases. To acquire then a tomography, several hundred projections are acquired over a range of relative angles between object and imaging system, obtained rotating around the acquisition axis which is parallel to the imaging plane. So-called \u201creconstruction\u201d algorithms, based on the inverse of the Radon transform, are then employed to obtain a 3D matrix of attenuation values, which are representative\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as aforementioned\u00a0\u2013\u00a0of the material density and its cross-section coefficient \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\na\n\n\n (see for example\u00a0Ref.\u00a086 for a thorough description of the technique). It should be noted that the same reconstruction algorithms can be used for both X-ray and neutron imaging. The main difference is that, while, laboratory X-ray scanners often employ conical sources, neutron beams are generally assumed parallel despite their slight paraxiality. This assumption is generally considered realistic given the small beam divergence, and is particularly true for small samples. The ensuing reconstruction algorithms rely on the same mathematical foundations (e.g., the Radon transform) but differ in practical aspects (notably, the influence of reconstruction parameters such as the sample\/source distance) and their computational efficiency.\n\n\n2.6\nElements of image processing\nSeveral operations are generally performed on acquired images to extract quantities describing the process(es) of interest. This is a vast topic as testified, for example, by the numerous dedicated books\u00a0\n87\u201390\n on the matter. In this short overview we aim to highlight some of the main classes of algorithms belonging to typical workflows in geomechanics, focusing on the similarities and differences between X-rays and neutrons. Some of the more commonly employed classes include: denoising, segmentation, quantification and analysis of incremental displacement and strain.\nEven with optimal acquisition parameters, noise is present in virtually any image. Common to both X-rays and neutrons is the family of operations improperly named \u201cnoise removal\u201d. The noise in reality is not removed, but rather smoothed, to the detriment of the spatial or temporal resolution of the image.\n91\n There are numerous denoising techniques, the most common one being perhaps low-pass filtering, with common kernels including uniform (mean), and Gaussian.\n92\n Median\u00a0\n93\n and bilateral\u00a0\n94\n filters are also frequently employed, albeit in recent times non-linear procedures such as anisotropic diffusion\u00a0\n95\n are becoming more common. The aforementioned deviation from the Beer\u2013Lambert law caused by scattering could be argued to also belong to this category. Some strategies to compensate for it are detailed in Section\u00a02.2. Besides this, neutrons tend to suffer from another source of noise less pronounced in X-ray imaging: gamma radiation. Gamma rays can come from the neutron source itself or be a by-product of nuclear reactions (e.g., produced by the decay of common elements such as aluminium or iron that have been exposed to neutrons). Gammas can pollute neutron images by adding brighter spots and streaks, which are often removed by median filtering or by taking the minimum of multiple images with time. They can also be partially removed by comparing the pixel value to its neighbours (e.g., employing \u201cremove outliers\u201d algorithms).\nAnother central aim in image analysis is to discern the components that constitute an image. This process can be seen as twofold: classifying voxels of the image into classes, e.g., grains, cement, voids, etc., and partitioning them into meaningful subsets, such as the individual grains. The process of voxels classification is generally named image segmentation and, because of its pivotal importance in a number of fields (e.g., medicine, physics, artificial intelligence), several approaches have been and are continuously being proposed. The latter operation of subdividing them into meaningful subsets will be here referred to as labelling.\nThree categories of approaches proposed in the literature to segment images of geomaterials can be broadly recognised\n96\n: histogram based, iterative pixel classification, and edge detection methods. Methods belonging to the first group divide the histogram of the greyscale into classes, defined by threshold grey values, which can be defined arbitrarily or established through an a priori criterion (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a097\u2013100). Methods in the second class share the use of iterative procedures to infer the probability of a voxel to belong to a class based on spatial and grey scale information. With each iteration the probability of a voxel to belong to a class is updated, for example based on the amount of neighbouring voxels belonging to the same class, the grey value and its local gradient.\n101\u2013103\n Edge detection methods, finally, focus on the detection of the changes in greyscale associated with body edges, which can be detected with gradient operators as variance, Laplacian and Sobel. Their nature makes them ideal for separating individual bodies, rather than classifying them (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a0104\u2013106). All the above methods can in principle work equally well in neutron and X-ray images.\nThe product of the above operations is an image where each voxel belongs to an user-defined number of categories. Labelling algorithms attempt to separate them into meaningful subsets, which is highly application-dependent. Two main classes of labelling can nonetheless be broadly identified: connected components labelling\u00a0\n107\n and basins labelling through watershed.\n108\n\n\n\nQuantification is here used as a broad term including both the analysis of the features and process by some form of reversal of the Beer\u2013Lambert law as well as the quantification of features from the segmented\/labelled images. The former includes for example the estimation of fluid absorbed or evaporated from porous media (e.g., in radiography in,\n69\n\n,\n\n109\n\n,\n\n110\n as detailed in Section\u00a03.3). Once the images are segmented it is also possible to extract continuous properties such as the porosity and the saturation (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a0111, 112). Once labelled, the size and shapes of individual features can also be estimated by a range of possible metrics (e.g., principal moments of inertia, Feret diameters.\n113\n) This step is extremely dependent on the nature of the processes and features of interest, more so than on the nature of the radiation (X-ray or neutron) used to acquire the image.\nAnother noteworthy category of algorithms is Digital Volume Correlation (DVC). Introduced in the 1980s,\n114\n\n,\n\n115\n the variety of methods falling under this category shares the maximisation of a \u201csimilitude potential\u201d between images to track and register 2D and 3D changes. Notably for geomechanics, this method allows for measuring full-field displacement and strains. This method is frequently used in X-ray imaging (as reviewed for example in\u00a0Refs.\u00a0116, 117) but can be equally well applied in neutron images as detailed in Sections\u00a03 and 4.\nThe above is by no means a complete list or an unequivocal organisation of the panoply of image processing options available in the literature, but aims at providing an overview of some of the more common tools, highlighting the similarities and differences between neutron and X-ray image processing. Some of the algorithms presented above (and a few more) are detailed in the following sections, organised by application and chronology.\n\n\n\n3\nNeutron imaging for geomechanics\n\n3.1\nHistorical perspective\nOnly few years after the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick, Hartmut Kallmann and Ernst Kuhn showed the first example of neutron radiographies. However, we need to wait nearly thirty years to see significant advances in this direction thanks to technological improvements in the film initially used to detect them.\n49\n The application to geomaterials was nearly immediate, with the pioneering work of Gardner and Kirkham,\n118\n who studied the energy reduction of very high energy (\u201cfast\u201d) neutrons from a source probe to detect the presence of water in a soil. We must then wait for an additional twenty years to see the first examples of neutron imaging in its stricter definition applied to rocks by Subramanian and Burkhart\u00a0\n119\n (see Fig.\u00a03), to concrete by Reijonen and Pihlajavaara\u00a0\n120\n and applied to soils by Wilson an co-workers, and by Lewis and Krinitzsky.\n121\n\n,\n\n122\n This is nearly a decade after the earliest examples of X-ray radiographies by Hamblin and Kenneth\u00a0\n123\n and by Calvert and Veevers\u00a0\n124\n. The first attempt to quantitatively analyse dynamic processes in radiography in geomaterials is perhaps that of Jasti and Coworkers\n125\n, where neutron radiographies of water moving in rock pores were acquired.\n\nThe earliest examples of (X-ray) tomography is usually considered to be that of B. Pollak of the Fort William Sanatorium in 1953,\n126\n which shows how since its early days, medical applications led the way in this technology. A pioneering application of X-ray CT to experimental geomechanics is due to Desrues and coworkers in Grenoble, who started from the 1980s to use X-ray CT as a quantitative tool for experimental investigation of strain localisation in sand (see\u00a0Ref.\u00a0127, and\u00a0Ref.\u00a0128 for a review). It is not until the 1990s,\n129\n\n,\n\n130\n though, that the first neutron tomographies of a rock are reported\u00a0\u2013\u00a0with the objective of characterising water in tuff samples for permanent disposal of radioactive wastes (see Fig.\u00a04). This significant delay with respect to X-ray imaging is perhaps due to the aforementioned lower availability of neutron facilities, but also to the lower flux in most of these facilities, which makes the acquisition more technically difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nNeutron imaging for fluid (flow)\nOne of the key questions that neutron imaging can address is the distribution of fluids in geomaterials, thanks to the high attenuation of hydrogen and its compounds to neutrons. Other techniques such as X-rays and magnetic resonance are employed to study this process, although the first requires generally the use of tracers\u00a0\n131\n and the second is limited by its spatial resolution.\n132\n An additional property of neutrons is of particular interest in this domain: isotope sensitivity. Hydrogen \n\n\n\n1\n\n\nH and deuterium \n\n\n\n2\n\n\nH in fact have an order of magnitude difference in terms of neutron \u201copacity\u201d, while being chemically very similar. This is also true for their compounds so normal water, H\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nO, and heavy water, \n\n\n\n2\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nO, are similar from a physico-chemical standpoint while being easy to discern in neutron imaging, making them ideal contrast agents. A comprehensive review of the studies of flow in porous media up to 2013 is reported by.\n57\n\n\nThe pioneering radiographic work of\u00a0\n125\n was followed by a number of early radiographic and tomographic studies characterising the state of the material, to determine the water distribution for a range of soils,\n121\n\n,\n\n122\n rocks\u00a0\n129\n\n,\n\n130\n concrete,\n133\n and even bricks\u00a0\n70\n\n,\n\n134\n and ceramics.\n135\n\n,\n\n136\n\n\nIn rock mechanics, beside the intrinsic interest in the spatial distribution of water,\n129\n\n,\n\n130\n some works focused on the water content as a proxy for porosity.\n70\n\n,\n\n137\u2013139\n Similarly, in soil mechanics neutron imaging has been used to assess the spatial distribution of water\u00a0\n140\n and of course the ensuing water retention curves in partially saturated quasi-static conditions, in a spatially averaged sense in radiography\u00a0\n141\u2013143\n and tomography.\n112\n\n,\n\n144\n For example, in\u00a0\n144\n the results from 3D tomographies of a drainage experiment with predefined heterogeneities are used to determine the saturation and hydraulic properties of sand. This is then employed for pore-scale flow simulations which are then upscaled to lab-scale simulations. As for rocks, water content has been used as a proxy to study porosity also in soils.\n145\n\n,\n\n146\n\n\nIn the case of cement and concrete, water plays a crucial role on the early-age curing and subsequent durability properties of concrete whether its local increase is a byproduct of carbonation\u00a0\n120\n or rather an effect of the hardening.\n110\n\n,\n\n133\n Water flow within the matrix in radiography\u00a0\n147\n and tomography\u00a0\n148\n\n,\n\n149\n has also been studied, observing that water can move several millimeteres from water-saturated aggregates into the surrounding matrix, as highlighted in Fig.\u00a05. Once again the porosity\u00a0\n150\n and its distribution\u00a0\n151\n\n,\n\n152\n were explored through neutron imaging. For example in Ref.\u00a0146 the evolution of the porosity at a cement\/clay interface was studied along two years through the observation of their water content in neutron radiography, revealing a porosity increase in the cement and a decrease in the clay. A review of the contribution of neutron imaging to the study of the durability of concrete is reported in Ref.\u00a0153.\nSimilar studies were also performed on another common construction material: bricks. Neutron radiography (and occasionally, tomographies at the end of the tests) was used to characterise the sorptivity of fired-clay and siliceous bricks\u00a0\n154\n\n,\n\n155\n as well as historical ones,\n156\n also to study the penetration of salts therein.\n\nThe body of work outlined above predominantly focuses on the characterisation of one or more quasi-static states. This is possible where either no process is occurring or its speed is slow with respect to the measurements and, ideally, controllable. This is rarely the case when studying, e.g., imbibition, multiphase flow, and freezing, whose controllability is more limited, and which should be studied dynamically to fully appreciate the underlying processes.\nGiven the limited flux available in most facilities, these dynamic measurements are often done with radiographies. Most pioneering works in this sense started to appear in the late 1908s, with the works of\u00a0Ref.\u00a0125 on rocks,\u00a0\n157\n\n,\n\n158\n on soils, and\u00a0\n159\n on concrete. Much of this work focuses on water imbibition in a dry rock.\n160\n) The numerous studies following them focus on different aspects, such as the significant and complex roles of surfactants used in hydraulic fracturing fluids\u00a0\n161\n (of particular interest for the oil and gas industry), fracture aperture width and surface roughness\u00a0\n162\n\n,\n\n163\n low permeability,\n164\n salinity of the water.\n165\n Many of these works couple the experimental observation with models, e.g., to validate fractal model\u00a0\n164\n\n,\n\n166\n or determine effective contact angles within fractures.\n167\n Some of these studies\u00a0\n168\n\n,\n\n169\n used hydrogen isotopes, notably heavy water. A similar method can also be used to distinguish (heavy) water and any other fluid such as oil. In the particular case of oil and water, petro-chemical applications immediately come to mind, for example to observe the relative displacement capacity of oil into water-saturated samples and vice-versa.\n138\n\n,\n\n170\n\n,\n\n171\n\n\nIn soils, similar flow studies were mostly performed starting from dry conditions.\n172\n\n,\n\n173\n A peculiarity of water flow into soils is that it is prone to create fingered structures\u00a0\n174\u2013177\n and can even occur within aggregates.\n178\n\n,\n\n179\n Also erosion,\n180\n capillary barriers\u00a0\n181\n and the interaction with plant roots (within the so-called rhizosphere) can severely affect flow and local water content.\n182\u2013184\n There are a number of recent studies focusing on the interplay plant\/rhizosphere, for example in dry conditions.\u00a0Ref.\u00a0185 studies plant resilience to drought and shows that the differential recovery of two regions of a root system causes substantial redistribution of water flow and induces flow across soil layers via capillary wicking. In\u00a0Ref.\u00a0186 the negative impacts of low soil moisture on rhizosphere processes is shown to be alleviated by a release of mucilage by the plant. This allows for fast diffusion of enzymes and substrates, and high enzyme activity in the vicinity of roots. The growth of the root itself\u00a0\n187\u2013189\n and its water uptake\u00a0\n190\n\n,\n\n191\n are also ideal applications of neutron radiography and tomography. No study seems to focus on the multi-fluid flow in soils, whose engineering interest is perhaps more limited.\nIn concrete, one of the key applications of neutron imaging is drying, which will be analysed in more detail in Section\u00a03.3. There are nonetheless several studies investigating the sorptivity of cement\u00a0\n151\n\n,\n\n152\n\n,\n\n192\u2013194\n for cementitious materials prepared under a broad range of conditions. A clear application in this context is the role of fractures and aggregates on flow\u00a0\n195\u2013198\n and its influence on reinforcements,\n199\u2013201\n see\u00a0\n170\n\n,\n\n202\n for rocks. Nonetheless, even when bespoke procedures are developed to measure fluid flow\u00a0\n203\n in regions of strain localisation, these studies suffer from an intrinsic limitation. While dynamic radiography (several frames per second) allows the observation of rapid processes of imbibition and fluid flow, their two-dimensional nature fails to capture complex three-dimensional structures \u2014 whether intrinsic to the material or induced, for example, by strain localisation. Explorations from the mid 2000s at acquisition speeds compatible with the speed of the process under investigation were generally performed at relatively low spatial resolutions.\u00a0Ref.\u00a0204 and\u00a0Ref.\u00a0205, for example, acquired 10s tomographies in an image constituted horizontally by 8 pixels, or 1.5\u00a0mm. Some early works also developed advanced problem-specific image processing algorithms, e.g., to quantify the water content for one-cm sand cubes\u00a0\n112\n\n,\n\n206\n with one-minute time resolution.\nThe recent developments in detector technology allowed experimental campaigns that optimise both spatial and temporal resolution for a given process.\nA notable example is the study by\u00a0Ref.\u00a0207, where a series of on-the-fly 3min neutron tomographies where acquired on loose sand at a resolution sufficient to observe the lupine roots contained therein. This was followed shortly after by the work of T\u00f6tzke et\u00a0al.,\n208\n where a series of 10s neutron tomographies where performed on similar material and with comparable resolution. The high speed allowed the study of the evolving hydraulic properties of granular media and most notably on the rhizosphere. The recent availability of high flux sources allowed a speed increase by almost an order of magnitude while also increasing both signal to noise ratio and spatial resolution: in\u00a0Ref.\u00a0209 a series of 1.5s tomographies were acquired at the Institut Laue Langevin, setting the current \u201crecord\u201d in terms of neutron tomography (see Fig.\u00a06).\nRecently,\u00a0Ref.\u00a0210 proposed a method to quantify the flux of water across the root system of transpiring plants by solving diffusion\u2013convection equations on a finite element mesh. In this case the method relies on the information coming from 30-second neutron tomographies of water uptake of Lupine roots.\nRecent studies take advantage of rapid neutron tomography to capture complex three-dimensional processes such as capillary barrier effects.\n181\n In\u00a0Ref.\u00a0180, the non-monotonic spatio-temporal evolution of clogging and unclogging of the flow path is studied\u00a0\u2013\u00a0more specifically, the deposition and erosion caused by an aqueous suspension with silica powder injected in a packed glass beads matrix. After identifying particles, the pore space is partitioned into Voronoi polyhedra, which are used as a support to track the evolution of the solid volume fraction (see Fig.\u00a07), as the underlying origin of internal flow path reorganisation. To accelerate the scans to a few minutes, the binary scan decomposition strategy proposed in\u00a0Ref.\u00a0211 is applied.\n\n\n\nIn the domain of rock mechanics, in\u00a0Ref.\u00a0212 the effect of strain localisation on fluid flow is studied while acquiring one minute tomographies at 200\u00b5m spatial resolution. A series of alternated flushes of heavy and normal water are used to characterise the evolution of the permeability as the sample is mechanically loaded in-situ, highlighting the limits of radiography (see Fig.\u00a08). In this case, fast acquisition allows this rapid process to be captured in full detail and without the \u201cblurring\u201d artefact that slower acquisitions would have. A few experimental campaigns are currently being performed on rocks (sandstones and limestones) with the specific objective of investigating the influence of strain and damage localisation on fluid flow,\n212\u2013214\n opening new perspectives on our understanding of fluid flow and its interaction with localised deformation. In terms of future developments for high speed neutron tomography, the opening of imaging instruments in uniquely high flux centres (NeXT-Grenoble at ILL\u00a0\n215\n) and the ongoing development of new high flux centres (the European Spallation Source, ESS) will prove essential to further these efforts. When the available flux is still insufficient for the speed of the process, a number of approaches have been suggested in recent times to increase information output under low dose conditions. A notable example are schemes for tomographic data acquisition based on the Greek golden ratio, introduced in\u00a0Refs.\u00a0216, 217 and adopted in neutron imaging in\u00a0Ref.\u00a0218 and shortly after in\u00a0Ref.\u00a0211, and then applied to fluid flow in\u00a0Ref.\u00a0219. In brief, this and similar scan decomposition strategies adapt the acquisition angle sequence so that subsets of chronologically contiguous projections contain sufficient information for reconstruction. This allows reconstruction with both high spatial and low temporal resolution and its converse, based on the number of frames used. Another notable family of approaches are projection matching optimisation techniques such as Projection-based Digital Volume Correlation P-DIC\u00a0\n220\n\n,\n\n221\n and Discrete Digital Projections Correlation.\n222\n In these methods, after an initial \u201cclassical\u201d tomography is acquired, as few as two orthogonal projections are used for the assessment of 3D variation fields, by minimising a metric of the difference between a projected updated model and the corresponding measures. The space\u2013time evolution can be characterised separating the spatial and temporal components using Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) techniques.\n223\n\n,\n\n224\n In this family of approaches, the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the occurring processes are iteratively matched with the experimental data, each term of the sum being sought a priori in separate representations in space and time. The first application of this approach to neutron imaging is that of\u00a0Ref.\u00a0225, where it was employed for the fast tracking of fluids. Other more problem-specific approaches were also discussed in the previous sections.\n\n\n3.3\nDrying\nDrying of concrete was one of the first applications of neutron radiography: Ref.\u00a0150 visualised moisture migration heating samples and calculated the vapour diffusion and mass transfer coefficients in concrete. Most early works focused though on the evolution with time of cement pastes undergoing environmental drying,\n109\n\n,\n\n110\n which is known to have a large impact on its mechanical properties. These studies found values in good agreement with traditionally measured porosity and sorptivity values. Some of these study their response under cyclic drying and water-absorption\u00a0\n226\n and some other on the effect of surface treatments.\n227\n Fewer works focus on this process in 3D.\n148\n\n\nA key engineering problem in this domain is moisture migration in construction materials in the event of a fire, which is at the origin of explosive spalling, which in turn is a known precursor to structural collapse. Given the high speed of the process, most studies tackled this problem in pseudo-2D conditions, focusing either on the overall migration of moisture\u00a0\n150\n\n,\n\n228\n\n,\n\n229\n or on its rapid variation ensuing crack opening.\n230\n However, these processes tend to be highly heterogeneous because of the presence of aggregates (in concrete), natural and induced heterogeneities, as well as the natural tendency of samples not to have \u201cflat\u201d fronts (which can lead to misinterpreting the 2D projections provided by radiography). The main issue with 3D+time neutron tomography is that the speed of the moisture profile requires matching acquisitions speeds. An important parameter is in fact the acceptable level of \u201cblurring\u201d for the data analysis. For example, in the case of a moisture front, if the speed of process is such that it covers multiple pixels during a tomography (which implicitly assumes that the first and last radiographies belong to the identical object), the ensuing artefacts in the reconstruction pollute a region which is often the one of interest. In\u00a0Ref.\u00a0231, the recent advances in terms of high speed tomography detailed in the last section were taken advantage of acquiring 1min tomographies. Concrete samples heated at 500\n\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n with different aggregate grading were tested, revealing a significantly different hydraulic response despite a nearly identical thermal profile (see Fig.\u00a09). Additionally, indicators of moisture accumulation ahead of the heating front, so far only hypothesised as a possible origin of spallation, and not detectable in radiography, were identified.\nBesides concrete, the drying of other geomaterials is of engineering interest. A notable case is wet sand, which can be used as a metal casting mould and where the extent of its dehydration determines the necessary amount of material.\n232\n A few studies focus instead on clays,\n233\n\n,\n\n234\n whose complex relationship between water content and shrinkage\/swelling makes neutron imaging an ideal probe.\n\nEnvironmental evaporation can also reduce the shear strength of soils, with important engineering implications, for example in slope stability. The radiographic studies of\u00a0Refs.\u00a0235\u2013239 tackled the moisture profiles for both homogeneous and layered soils. Some studies focused on this heterogeneous process in 3D\u00a0\n141\n although relatively few did so in a discrete, and not spatially averaged, sense (although some study multiple \u201ctwin samples\u201d undergoing this processes.\n240\n)\n\n\n3.4\nTesting in extreme mechanical conditions\nTesting of geomaterials in extreme conditions is a broad domain in both geophysics\u00a0\n241\n and geomechanics\u00a0\n242\n since its early days.\n243\n\n,\n\n244\n The value of imaging in this context is clear, yet the extreme conditions require large cells that are harder to penetrate. For very small (few mm) samples this is compatible with the more powerful X-ray sources available (e.g., \u00a0Refs.\u00a0245, 246). While this is acceptable for a number of geomaterials, several have Representative Elementary Volumes (REV) far larger than that, whether because of inclusions (e.g., the aggregates of concrete) or natural\/induced features (e.g., depositional planes, fractures). These larger samples require thick metallic walls to withstand the applied pressures, which are best suited to the higher transparency of neutrons to metals.\nA notable application is fluid flow in concrete at high pressures, for example for understanding the durability and behaviour of dams and infrastructures. The high penetration capability of neutrons to metals allows the construction of high confinement vessels over sizes compatible with the intrinsic length scales of real concrete (and reinforcements), i.e., several centimetres. One such testing rig, capable of withstanding 50 MPa pressure over samples of up to 7cm in diameter, has been recently developed by\u00a0Ref.\u00a0247. This allowed the water flow in a concrete sample cured in heavy water to be imaged, revealing the dominant influence of local heterogeneities even at very high confinement. Following studies\u00a0\n248\n also explore the role of reinforcement bars and their geometry and orientation in 3D.\nComparably high pressures are for example also necessary to hydraulically fracture rocks, e.g., to enhance geothermal energy performances, for gas extraction, as well as to study the effect of fluid on the initiation of earthquakes.\n249\n\n,\n\n250\n A recent example is provided by\u00a0Refs.\u00a0251, 252, where shales were hydraulically fractured in site conditions (in plane strain a vertical stress equivalent to 3km depth) and rapid neutron imaging allowed for following the initiation process as well as the essential role of natural shale heterogeneities such as its bedding planes, few millimetres apart.\nFor temperatures below few hundred degrees and small samples, the required cells are generally X-ray compatible but as we move towards the in-situ study of magma, it might become necessary to use neutron imaging.\nIt should be observed that the above examples also take advantage of neutron imaging for fluid flow. Comparatively few examples use neutron imaging for solely mechanical purposes (e.g., \u00a0Ref.\u00a010), and the potential of this technique in this domain is only starting to be tapped.\n\n\n3.5\nOther applications\nMost of the aforementioned examples focus on the capability of neutrons to detect hydrogen and to penetrate through metals. There are nonetheless a number of other unique properties that can reveal essential to many open problems in geomechanics. For example a number of environmental pollutants such as Cadmium are highly visible in neutron imaging and our capacity to \u201cwash\u201d them from a rock can be studied.\n253\n Also salts play an important hydro-mechanical role in geomaterials by creating flow barriers or inducing fractures upon deposition. Several elements (Chlorine, Boron) are highly visible in neutron imaging.\n254\n\n,\n\n255\n Conversely at times the opposite is true, and it is their transparency to neutrons (as opposed to X-rays) that may be of interest when a combination of the techniques is used\u00a0\n256\n as it will be explored in more detail in the next section.\nIn some cases, water becomes part of the mineral structure (the so-called hydrous minerals), which are also well captured in neutron imaging.\n55\n The full potential of this technique for geomechanics is likely to be as of yet untapped, notably because of its less pervasive diffusion and less known potential in this domain.\n\n\n\n4\nNeutrons plus x-rays\nSo far this paper has focused on the unique properties of neutron imaging. As highlighted in Fig.\u00a01, a number of elements are far more (or less) visible in neutron than in X-ray imaging, making these two techniques profoundly complementary. This was acknowledged since the early days, also given the inspirational role that X-ray imaging has had on its neutron counterpart. Even the neutron imaging believed to be the first ever published, reported in Fig.\u00a010,\u00a0\n257\n already presented a comparison with photons (in the \u201cgamma\u201d energy range in this case). The earliest example of dual acquisition for geosciences is perhaps that of Lewis and Krinitzsky\u00a0\n122\n for soils and rocks. Shortly after, Howdyshell\u00a0\n133\n presented a comparative evaluation of water and cement content in fresh concrete. A broad-spectrum review of the application of their complementarity is presented in\u00a0Ref.\u00a054, although no geoscience example is reported.\n\n\nSome early examples use X-rays for their capacity to capture fine details of the structure and neutrons to capture water uptake.\n204\n In\u00a0Ref.\u00a0259 and\u00a0Ref.\u00a0260 initial neutron and X-ray tomographies are used to characterise in detail the microstructure (e.g., their porosity, tortuosity and zones of localised deformation) which is then used to interpret a series of neutron radiographies. In other studies, the same principle was used to characterise the capillary bridges of a given material state.\n240\n\n,\n\n261\n Similarly,\u00a0Ref.\u00a0148 used the combination of the two techniques to study the microstructure of a drying cement sample. The work detailed in\u00a0Ref.\u00a0256 explores the aforementioned complementarity of X-ray and neutrons to study salt transport and crystallisation in porous limestones.\n\nAnother noteworthy example is concrete: Fig.\u00a011 shows a scan of a concrete sample acquired with both ionising radiations. X-rays are clearly effective in distinguishing pores from the rest of the matrix but, because of their comparable density, aggregates and mortar are barely distinguishable. Conversely, the low neutron attenuation of the \n\n\nSiO\n\n\n2\n\n\n aggregates makes them stand out with respect to the cement matrix, whereas it brings them too close to the average attenuation values of the pores to allow their straightforward segmentation.\nThe power of multi-modal imaging for image segmentation is also evident from\u00a0Ref.\u00a0262 where the distribution of molecular and mineralogical heterogeneities of oil reservoir rocks is established at the pore scale, whose interpretation is helped by Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe combination of X-ray and neutron information allows the lower neutron flux to be compensated, as for example in the work by\u00a0Ref.\u00a069, which combined X-ray and neutron imaging to study the complex hydro-mechanical interactions in Callovo-Oxfordian claystone, used for the storage of radioactive wastes (see Fig.\u00a012).\nIn all the above examples, the complementarity of these techniques could only be partially exploited: since the two images could not be acquired simultaneously, either a single state was multi-modally characterised, or the comparison was made at the level of analogy. In this case, multiple tests are performed in matching conditions and compared (e.g., \u00a0Ref.\u00a069). This approach can provide great insight and is often precursor to later studies as the technology advances (e.g., in the classic example of\u00a0Ref.\u00a0263). The key limitation is in this case that the two informations can only be matched in an averaged or statistical sense.\nIn the last few years, three facilities have developed the capacity to acquire simultaneous neutron and X-ray tomographies : PSI in Switzerland in 2015,\n264\n\n,\n\n265\n NIST in the USA in 2016 (the publication describing it dates to 2017\u00a0\n81\n although abstracts showcasing its performance are one year older), and ILL in France in 2017\u00a0\n215\n (less than one year after the entrance in operation of the instrument).\nAn early example is that of\u00a0Ref.\u00a0266 where tomographies of shale samples were simultaneously acquired at 30 \n\u03bc\nm (following an earlier non-simultaneous work from the same group\n267\n) allowing a richer and more rigorous segmentation of minerals and structures, as shown in Fig.\u00a013. The first example of simultaneous vectorial 4D image acquisition (3D + a process + X\/N) is perhaps that of\u00a0\n268\n to characterise the dynamics of water absorption in Callovo-Oxfordian claystone by comparing material deformation as well as water arrival. Neutron and X-ray datasets are registered pairwise into a common coordinate system, which allows the data to become a vector-valued (reconstructed X-ray and neutron value) 3D field varying in time. Superposed X-ray and neutron 3D volumes allows an improved identification of mineral phases in this complex material. The strain field obtained from the application of 3D Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) on the X-ray time series data is locally compared to changes in water content available from the neutrons, and a model for the evolution of greylevels due to both water arrival and strain is presented, which could be applied to a number of other studies.\n\nIt is clear that, much in the same way early 4D datasets required the development of new analysis algorithms (for example DVC), new developments are also required to quantitatively interpret this data. One of the earlier works in this direction is the recent theoretical development in\u00a0Ref.\u00a0269, which allows not only for accurately (and user-independently) aligning neutron and X-ray tomographies (with no need for dedicated markers), but also for automatic segmentation of the phases\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by analysing the joint X-ray and neutron histogram. A recent paper by\u00a0Ref.\u00a0270 presents the technical details of the algorithm proposed by\u00a0Ref.\u00a0269 and applies it to neutron and X-ray tomographies of concrete (those shown in Fig.\u00a011). This yields a registered neutron image that matches the X-ray image with sub-pixel accuracy (within 0.05 pixels displacement \n\n0\n.\n00\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n\n rotation, in this specific case).\n\n\n5\nDiscussion and perspectives\nThis paper has hopefully highlighted the broad spectrum of applications and vast potential that neutron imaging has for our understanding of geomechanics. Notable areas of application range from the determination of key microstructural properties (moisture, porosity, mineralogy) to the multi-phase flow in geomaterials (whether homogeneous or within natural and induced features) and from drying process (whether at environmental conditions or at high temperature) to testing at extreme conditions.\nSeveral of the reported studies were exploratory in nature, albeit several others have shown much advancement in the rigorous quantification of key processes underlying the hydro\u2013chemo\u2013thermo-mechanical behaviour of geomaterials.\nSome notable cases of the less explored domains include the partial saturation of soils (explored at the level of the individual capillary bridges), the mechanical testing at extreme conditions and the high temperature behaviour of construction materials.\nIn the applications where broader experimental campaigns have been performed, the ongoing effort is in the rigorous quantification, for example, of moisture profiles, whether induced by wetting, drying or capillarity, as well as the underlying fluid flow transport parameters (sorptivity, diffusivity). Beside these problem-specific algorithmic developments, a key element in the rigorous quantification of fluids is the correction for scattering. Numerous approaches have been proposed, from beamline and problem-specific calibrations (to model for example the point scatter function, although more work in this direction is still needed).\nFurthermore, as highlighted in Section\u00a02.2, the attenuation coefficients are wavelength dependent, meaning that to improve our precision, the monochromatisation (i.e., capacity to discern wavelengths) options, now available at multiple beamlines, can play an important role. The potential of multispectral imaging is though much broader, for example allowing to discern liquid water from ice\u00a0\n254\n\n,\n\n271\n based on the discrepancy of their attenuation at different wavelengths. An extreme case of wavelength-dependency of attenuation are the so-called \u201cBragg Edges\u201d where the change is so sharp that when multiple narrowly selected monochromatic beams are selected, it is possible to obtain indications about the contained minerals. This is frequently used for metals (e.g., \u00a0Ref.\u00a0272) but in rocks this appear to be limited to some preliminary studies in their X-ray analogues.\n273\n Other emerging techniques that provide alternative contrast mechanisms, whose use in geomechanics is so far limited, are phase contrast\u00a0\n274\n\n,\n\n275\n and dark field imaging\u00a0\n276\n as well as neutron polarisation\u00a0\n277\n which allows the study in 3D of magnetic field, which may be of interest for ferromagnetic geomaterials.\nIn classic \u201cattenuation\u201d imaging there are also promising new developments. Recently, the tomographic speed passed from the tens of second regime\u00a0\n278\n to the second range,\n209\n which opens new perspectives for the study of dynamic processes. Analogously, the resolution has recently reached close to 4\u00b5m,\n279\n\n,\n\n280\n with an ongoing effort to reach 1\u00b5m, which opens new possibilities for a number of processes. Both of these efforts have been (and will be) facilitated by the opening of imaging facilities at high flux neutron sources such as the Institute Laue Langevin (ILL) in France, and, in the near future, of the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden.\nEven when the 1\u00b5m resolution will be attained, it will be insufficient to capture finer details such as the nanopores of some geomaterials. This is where the combination with X-ray imaging outlined in Section\u00a04 becomes essential. Besides the possibility to acquire images of the same object at a better resolution, it is in fact envisaged to merge the images to achieve a superior spatio-temporal resolution with the less performant of the two (the neutrons, in this case). These are of course only some of the tantalising perspectives that the combination of neutrons and X-rays offers, thanks to the highly complementary information of the two which is only hinted in the pioneering works presented.\nThe continuous increase in performance of the facilities, the broadening of the contrast options, the expanding portfolio of quantification approaches and their improved rigorousness (e.g., through scattering correction and the use of monochromatic beams as detailed in Section\u00a02.2 and by combining multi-modal information as outlined in Section\u00a04) all delineate a bright future for the role of neutron imaging in geomechanics.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAlessandro Tengattini: Conceptualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing, Investigation.

Dissolution is a process sensitive to pH, salinity, and CO2 content\n2\u20134\n which makes limestones (and other carbonate-rich sedimentary rocks) also sensitive to water-assisted deformation processes during mechanical loading, including time-dependent stress-corrosion microcracking\n5\n and pressure-enhanced dissolution.\n6\n Today\u2019s knowledge on fluid-assisted rock deformation has improved, but the occasionally dramatic effects of fluid chemistry on deformation behaviour remain underappreciated. This is of particular importance, since there is brine present in all sedimentary basins,\n7\n with examples of common ions being Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, CO3, and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n.\n8\n Local equilibrium will depend on local hydrogeology, and changes in flow conditions should affect such an equilibrium. Moreover, several saline limestone aquifers are hydrocarbon reservoirs, wastewater injection sites, geothermal energy reservoirs and potential CO2 geological storage sites. Reservoir geo-engineering involves manipulating the fluid chemistry on timescales of the order of days to several years, which is short compared to geological timescales of thousands of years. Today\u2019s pressure on natural resources and space resulting from world population growth, needs and disparate distribution increasingly drives to a greater usage of the underground. Reservoir stability is paramount since reservoir compaction can lead to severe economic and environmental consequences such as induced seismicity, well failure, and surface subsidence \n\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n Ref.\u00a01. This highlights the importance of understanding the coupled mechano-chemical effects on the targeted rock. Furthermore, many limestone formations in populated areas (such as the Greek Corinth rift zone, and the Italian Apennines\n9\n) are also earthquake-prone. In these regions, earthquakes are shown to be regularly correlated to high pressure fluid fluxes,\n10\u201312\n with the potential for associated changes in fluid chemistry. There are numerous studies linking induced seismicity to fluid pumping,\n13\u201316\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\u00a0many\u00a0others\n\n\n even before taking any potential chemical effects into account.\nIn limestone, water weakening manifests as reduced peak strength and\/or reductions in the stress at the onset of inelastic behaviour.\n17\u201321\n Very few studies exist that investigate the combined mechano-chemical effects of brine on limestone deformation, though there are indications that with decreasing water activity carbonate-rich rocks become stronger,\n17\n\n,\n\n19\n\n,\n\n22\n except for Na2SO4-rich solutions. In the presence of Na2SO4 a decrease in strength and bulk modulus has been observed\n23\n\n,\n\n24\n in highly porous limestone rocks tested at elevated temperatures, due to lowering of mineral surface charges.\n23\n As a known inhibitor to carbonate precipitation and dissolution, Mg\n\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n has been used to slow down pressure-enhanced carbonate dissolution.\n25\n Finally, at similar water activity, one study has shown that MgSO4 and Na2SO4 have opposite effects on crack propagation rates in cm-sized single calcite crystals.\n26\n Natural reservoir brines are usually a mixture of many ions \n\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n\u00a0Ref.\u00a027, and all of these are common ions in subsurface brines,\n8\n as well as being ions of interest in enhanced oil recovery.\n28\n If MgSO4 and Na2SO4 adversely affect the propagation of a single crack, then what is the net effect on the dynamics of failure of a carbonate-rich sedimentary rock, essentially composed of many calcite crystals? We address this question performing triaxial experiments simulating relevant reservoir pressure conditions on chemically treated limestone samples.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nMaterials\nBrine solutions were prepared by dissolving in DI water the appropriate quantity of MgSO4 or Na2SO4 salt to create a 0.4 M solution. The choice for these solutions and this concentration was motivated by the results of Bergsaker et\u00a0al. \n26\n who indicated a large difference between MgSO4 and Na2SO4 on the rate of crack growth in a calcite crystal at concentrations in this range. Solutions were stirred until visual confirmation indicated all salt was dissolved, after which excess ground CaCO3 powder (obtained from grinding and sieving leftover pieces of the limestone tested) was added. Subsequently, all solutions were stirred for 48+ hours, the time needed to create a saturated solution.\n3\n\n,\n\n25\n\n,\n\n29\n We then saturated our limestone samples with each solution under vacuum until all air bubbles were gone (indicating full saturation, 2 to 3\u00a0h minimum), and samples were tested either the next day (S), or left to sit under room temperature (20\u00a0\u00b0C; environmentally controlled chamber) and ambient pressure for 50 days (L) or 200 days (XL). During exposure time, the sample container was closed off, and hence contained the fluid, the sample, excess carbonate powder and a fixed (but ample) supply of air. This means that the solutions were in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2, but no evaporation could take place, thus ensuring the fluid composition remains constant over time. Reference experiments were performed with overnight saturation in CaCO3-saturated solution only. The use of CaCO3-saturated solutions with excess fine-grained powder ensures there was no net dissolution during the waiting time and the experiment, hence no chemical reaction was expected, and the initial sample characteristics (such as mass, porosity) should remain unaffected during the waiting time. Note that the excess ground powder was kept in the solution during this waiting time to ensure continuous saturation by having excess fine-grained material that can easily dissolve and precipitate due to small temperature changes (similar to the procedure used when dissolving a less soluble ionic compound\n\n\n\nc.f.\n\n\n Ref.\u00a030). A geochemical equilibrium batch reaction model (PHREEQC\n31\n) indicates that a saturated carbonate solution with these concentrations of MgSO4 or Na2SO4 have a pH of 8.25; i.e.\u00a0the presence of the salts does not lead to additional dissolution\/precipitation. The exposure duration is expected to affect the diffusion of ion species throughout the pore fluid, especially in the grain boundary fluid, the effect of which is quantified here in terms of influence on mechanical behaviour of the rock samples.\nThe limestone samples used in this study are from the same dm-sized blocks as used by Castagna et\u00a0al. \n32\n These blocks were collected from the Ragusa Formation of the Western Hyblean Plateau, accessed in section via outcrops in a quarry near the Comiso village in southeast Sicily, Italy. This rock is also known as Comiso limestone in two previous publications.\n32\n\n,\n\n33\n The Ragusa Formation occurs in monotonic, gently dipping layers of maximum thickness of 60\u00a0cm, and is interlayered with unconsolidated clay-bearing strata. Carbonate layers within the formation consist generally of a combination of calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2), or occasionally of pure calcite. At the intralayer scale, the fabric is visually isotropic, and our samples all looked similar in terms of colour and colour variation (Figure S1). This limestone is composed of calcite (\n\u223c\n95%\u201398%), a small amount of quartz (\n\u223c\n2%\u20133% wt) and possible traces of dolomite, as determined from X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Fluorescence.\n32\n\n\nCylindrical samples of 54\u00a0mm diameter were cored using a radial drilling machine tool equipped with diamond tipped hollow barrel. The cylinders were then trimmed with a diamond-tipped rock saw so that the length diameter ratio was approximately 2:1; the end surfaces ground to a flatness of \n<\n\n\n\n20\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n using a surface grinding machine tool. Based on the similar look in terms of colour, colour\u200b variations and grain size between the samples, only small differences in sample composition were expected. An image of the matrix far away from the damage zone in one of the post-experimental thin sections is shown in Fig.\u00a01 to have a rough indication of what the starting material looks like.\n\n\n\n\nSince limestone rocks often exhibit porosity variations within the same lithology, we have measured porosity of all the samples before testing. The sample\u2019s porosities vary between 7.5 and 26.3% (see Table\u00a01), with an average at 14.6%, and an average density of 2.47 g\/m3, determined following a standard saturation and buoyancy technique before long-term exposure (i.e.\u00a0immediately after vacuum saturation). Throughout the paper, when porosity is mentioned, we refer to this pre-testing sample porosity. The samples from the same blocks used by Castagna et\u00a0al. \n32\n have a reported porosity of 10.1%, which falls in the range of porosities covered by the samples used in the current study. Note that Bakker et\u00a0al. \n33\n performed high temperature experiments on samples from the same quarry but from a different sampling campaign. Their samples had a lower initial average porosity of 8.7%, and, based on their description, contained more dolomitic material than the samples tested here. We note that a lower porosity and higher dolomite content can lead to strengthening\n34\n\n,\n\n35\n; therefore, we do not compare our results to those obtained by Bakker et\u00a0al. \n33\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nMethods\n\n2.2.1\nSample assembly and testing procedure\nWe placed each sample between two hardened steel platens and then encased in a heat-shrink Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane to prevent ingress of confining fluid into the rocks. Three piezo-transducers, one for P-waves and two for S-waves polarized at 90\u00b0 from each other, were embedded in each platen for measuring ultrasonic velocity in the axial direction of loading. The samples were then instrumented with two axial extensometers (MTS 632.90F-12, accurate to \n\u00b1\n0.01%), positioned diametrically opposite each other over the central 50\u00a0mm of the sample, and a circumferential chain extensometer (MTS 632.92H-03, accurate to \n\u00b1\n0.01%) positioned at mid-length. A third platen, not part of the aforementioned sample assembly, was spherically seated to prevent eccentric loading. This spherically seated platen was in turn fixed to a 2.6 MN capacity force transducer (MTS 661.98B.01, accurate to \n\u00b1\n0.32% of load) to measure the vertical load applied to the sample. Finally, empty pore fluid tubing was connected to the top and bottom platens to allow for any pore fluid to flow out of the sample without uncontrolled pore pressure build up during deformation and thus ensured macroscopic drained conditions.\nTriaxial testing was undertaken in a (commercially available) MTS 815 servo-controlled stiff frame inside a vessel capable of a confining pressure up to 140 MPa. A schematic of the apparatus is shown in Fig.\u00a03\n\n\n\n\nfor\u00a0more\u00a0details,\u00a0see\n\n\n Ref.\u00a036. All experiments were performed at room temperature in an environmentally controlled chamber at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. Once the sample assembly was mounted in the vessel, an initial axial pre-load of 2.3 kN (i.e.\u00a01 MPa; well within the elastic domain of the material) was applied, to ensure a stable contact and alignment of the platens. The confining pressure vessel was then closed and filled with mineral oil confining fluid. Both pore fluid outlets were left open to atmosphere for the drained conditions. Note that Bakker et\u00a0al. \n33\n performed drained experiments on lower porosity and stronger Ragusa limestone, and no pore fluid pressure build-up during deformation was reported. A differential stress of about 1 MPa was maintained whilst the confining pressure was increased at 2 MPa\/min to the desired confining pressure of 7, 30 and 70 MPa, respectively. Subsequently, axial loading was initiated in constant axial strain rate control of 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 s\u22121, controlled directly from the average of the two axial extensometers. When the sample was approaching peak stress, control was switched to circumferential extensometer control at a corresponding rate of 1x 10\u22123 mm s\u22121, thus keeping the axial strain rate constant whilst macroscopic failure occurred (Figure S2 for example curves of axial strain rate versus time). Using the lateral displacement feedback signal is a standard control method\n37\n to capture the full stress\u2013strain characteristics of both Class I and Class II rock failure (Fig.\u00a03c), the two potentially observable failure modes of rocks in stiff rigs.\n37\u201342\n Class II is indicated by a negative to vertical slope \n\u0394\n\n (\n\u03c3\n1-\n\u03c3\n3)\/\n\u0394\n\n\n\u03b5\n-\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n42\n (Fig.\u00a03c). The experiment was continued until a residual strength stage was reached or a significant amount of axial strain was recorded (between 2% and 5%). In addition, during each test, 5 ultrasonic velocity measurements were done using the classical ultrasonic pulse transmission technique \n\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n Refs.\u00a043, 44: (i) at 1 kN of axial loading (open cell), (ii) at 2.3 kN of axial loading (cell filled with oil), (iii) once confining pressure was reached, (iv) at onset of dilatancy (departure from linear elastic behaviour in axial strain), and (v) just before terminating the test (either residual or maximum axial strain recorded). The first two ultrasonic velocity measurements, not reported here, were done for calibration purposes only. The third ultrasonic velocity survey is used to probe the material characteristics prior to axial loading (Fig.\u00a02). The differential stress increase was briefly paused during the fourth ultrasonic velocity measurements to ensure the sample was at steady state during the measurement.\nThe porosity variation noted earlier indicates some sample heterogeneity is present, and could potentially impede seeing any effect from the sample\u2019s exposure to different fluids. One way to address the effect of initial sample heterogeneity and exposure duration on material properties is to compare for all samples how the ultrasonic velocities taken before loading varies (i.e.\u00a0as soon as the sample has reached target confining pressure; measurement iii in the above description). These velocities are expected to reflect the sample characteristics prior to deformation though increased confining pressure slightly modify the microstructure (closing cracks for instance) and results in higher velocities than at ambient conditions.\n45\n For all samples here, the P-wave velocity \n\n\nV\n\n\np\n\n\n and S-wave velocity \n\n\nV\n\n\ns\n\n\n are within expectation for carbonate formations,\n46\n and exhibit a slight decrease with increasing porosity (Fig.\u00a02). Note especially that there is no obvious correlation between velocity (and therefore of initial sample heterogeneity) with pore fluid type or with exposure duration (Fig.\u00a02b, d). This lack of correlations supports our initial assumption that the exposure to our different fluids does not lead to large changes to the grain structure (cementation or dissolution), i.e.\u00a0we assume chemical reactions changing the sample structure are absent during exposure\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as also confirmed by the PHREEQC models.\nThe axial load, axial load actuator displacement, axial stress (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n1\n\n\n), differential stress (\n\u03c3\n\n1\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n3), confining pressure \n\n\nP\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n (\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\u03c3\n\n\n3), confining pressure actuator displacement, axial strain (\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nax\n\n\n), circumferential strain (\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\ncirc\n\n\n) and temperature were monitored throughout the experiments and recorded at two independent sampling frequencies of 1 s (i.e.\u00a0sampling frequency based on time) and 500N (i.e.\u00a0sampling frequency based on force, to ensure recording of multiple data points during rapid stress drops). Furthermore, note that since displacement and force were measured directly on the sample (Fig.\u00a03), no additional corrections are necessary to derive strain and stress from displacement and force data respectively. All experiments are listed in Table\u00a01. A limited number of repeat experiments was undertaken (constrained by sample availability): CaCO3, S treated samples at 7 MPa of confining pressure and XL exposure to Na2SO4 at 30 MPa of confining pressure. This allowed us to further assess the importance of sample variability and starting porosity for this specific rock type. Note that the Mg-exposure reproducibility test is not presented as the planned repeat sample was unexpectedly damaged before testing.\n\n\n2.2.2\nData processing\nWe determined the static Young\u2019s modulus \n\n\nE\n\n\ns\nt\na\nt\n\n\n as the slope coefficient of the linear portion of the stress\u2013axial strain curve, chosen as 25 to 75% of peak stress, which ensured a repeatable procedure. We calculated the dynamic Young\u2019s moduli using the ultrasonic velocity measurements (\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nP\n\n\n,\n\n\nV\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n) and saturated densities \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ns\na\nt\n\n\n of the samples\n47\n: \n\n\n\nE\n\n\nd\ny\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ns\na\nt\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nS\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nV\n\n\nP\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\nV\n\n\nS\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nP\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nV\n\n\nS\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n. We note that in material science homogeneous materials, such as pure metals, have equal static and dynamic moduli. In rocks, significant differences between static and dynamic are expected due to their heterogeneities in comparison, where the dynamic parameter is almost always larger than the static one \n\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n Refs.\u00a048\u201351.\nIn the brittle regime, i.e.\u00a0for the samples exhibiting a maximum stress in the stress\u2013axial strain graphs, followed by mechanical weakening, we determined the key damage points as follows \n\n\n\nc.f.\n\n\n Ref.\u00a052: (i) the crack initiation stress, taken as the stress at which the stress\u2013axial strain curve deviates from linearity; (ii) the stress at which unstable crack growth commences, taken as the maximum in accumulated volumetric strain, and (iii), the peak stress, observed in the stress\u2013axial strain curve as the point of maximum stress. We define macroscopic ductile behaviour by a continuous strain hardening without strength loss, following the classical definition by Rutter.\n53\n In this ductile regime,\n53\n we determined the onset of shear-enhanced compaction, observed as the inflection point (deviation from linearity) on the stress-volumetric strain curve (i.e.\u00a0similar to C* from Wong et\u00a0al. \n54\n or Vajdova et\u00a0al. \n55\n). Since we lack hydrostatic experiments for comparison we choose to define this parameter in this manner. We also used the maximum volumetric strain for those curves that exhibit a transition from compaction to dilatancy, to represent ductile yield or \u201cfailure\u201d in the ductile regime.\n54\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3\nMicro-tomography and microstructure\nAfter the experiments, the samples that failed in the brittle regime were scanned with a NanoTom microtomograph at TU Delft, using a resolution of \n\n60\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n\/voxel. Samples were scanned in full size, i.e.\u00a054\u00a0mm diameter, and 108\u2013125\u00a0mm high. Note that fracture aperture needs to be about twice the voxel size to be accurately resolved. Using Avizo\u00a9 software (version 9) all scans were processed, similarly to Pluymakers et\u00a0al. \n56\n Before fracture extraction all samples were filtered with a non-local-means filter, which is an edge-preserving filter.\n57\n The parameters are listed in Table\u00a01. They are respectively window size, the local neighbourhood and the similarity value, and are related to a combination of fracture aperture and length, matrix grain size and level of denoising necessary. Movies of the slices and extracted fractures are shown in Movie S1\u2013S7. Furthermore, attempts were made to produce thin sections of areas comprising the principal damage zone in the samples. Unfortunately, only two low quality thin sections were eventually done (samples CL3-6 and CL2-4); the other samples\u2019 damage zones were lost in the process due to inappropriate methodology. The micrographs presented here were obtained with a standard optical microscope outfitted with a camera, and backscatter electron images were obtained using a scanning electron microscope.\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nMechanical results\nWe focus here only on the impact of the ion species and address the concomitant role of the porosity in a dedicated section of the discussion.\nDetailed results of sample loading and failure behaviours are shown in Fig.\u00a04. At 7 MPa, the shape of the resulting stress\u2013strain curves show differences between the ion species (Fig.\u00a04a; b). All samples exhibit brittle failure, i.e.\u00a0peak stress followed by strength loss. However, only those samples exposed short (1 or 50 days) to MgSO4 exhibit class II type failure, indicated by the negative to vertical slope \n\u0394\n\n (\n\u03c3\n1-\n\u03c3\n3)\/\n\u0394\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n and high dilatancy post-failure. For the reference solution, the samples behaved brittle at 30 MPa, and ductile at 70 MPa\u00a0\u2013\u00a0i.e.\u00a0following the trend as reported by Ref.\u00a032 for dry and wet Ragusa limestone. In the presence of MgSO4 the short exposed sample at 30 MPa already behaved in a ductile manner, and the 200 days exposed sample still behaved brittle, which can point to an early onset of the brittle\u2013ductile transition compared to the dry, wet and CaCO3 saturated samples\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\u00a0this\u00a0study,\u00a0respectively\n\n\n. In the presence of Na2SO4, two of the three samples tested at 30 MPa, one S and one XL, behaved ductile. The repeat samples exposed to NaSO4 for 200 days (XL) failed in a brittle manner, i.e.\u00a0a similarly early onset of the brittle\u2013ductile transition as for MgSO4. All samples tested at 70 MPa exhibited ductile behaviour.\n\nComparing the key stresses as defined in Section\u00a02.2.2, there are clear differences in the geomechanical behaviour of the samples as a function of the ion species exposure (Fig.\u00a05), both in the brittle field and the ductile field. Fig.\u00a05a includes also the peak stresses of dry and wet Ragusa (Comiso) limestone from Ref.\u00a032 for comparison. Comparing our reference samples with CaCO3-saturated solution to those tested with 24 h exposure to deionized water\n32\n (i.e.\u00a0experiments in which the pore fluid is undersaturated with respect to CaCO3, similar to\n17\n), CaCO3-saturated solutions lead to weaker samples than those in undersaturated water. They are at 7 MPa only half as strong, and at 30 MPa only 4 MPa weaker (Fig.\u00a05a). We performed a repeat experiment at 7 MPa for two samples with a porosity of 12.8 and 21.5% respectively, which indicated all three key stresses varied within 5 MPa. Comparing the key stresses within our own reference dataset, the stress difference at which unstable crack growth commences and the peak stress in the brittle field lie very close, only 5 to 10 MPa. The key stresses for samples tested both at 7 and 30 MPa (regardless of S, L or XL exposure) all line up, with the ones for the sample tested at 30 MPa exhibiting slightly larger difference (Fig.\u00a05b). The slope between the three key stresses is shallower at 30 MPa than at 7 MPa. The ductile yield stress (the stress at which dilatancy takes place) in the 70 MPa test is at a higher stress than the peak stress of the brittle samples (Fig.\u00a05d).\nAll MgSO4-exposed samples that behaved brittle are shown in Fig.\u00a05b. For 24 h exposure to MgSO4, at 7 MPa it was 13 MPa stronger than the reference sample. With prolonged exposure all key stresses increase, and the peak stresses for the samples (all low porosity samples, similar to those from Castagna et\u00a0al.) with 50 and 200 day exposure time are the highest in the dataset: 40 (at 7 MPa) and 60 MPa (at 30 MPa) higher than for the dry samples. Given that dry strength was 116 and 160 MPa respectively,\n32\n this represents a \n\u223c\n35% strength increase due to MgSO4-exposure. In the brittle field, at comparable confining pressures MgSO4 leads to an increase of \n>\n20 MPa in all key stresses compared to the reference dataset. For each individual sample, the difference between the key stresses is about 20 to 30 MPa. The slope between the key stresses and confining pressure is the same, regardless of confining pressure applied and exposure duration. Ductile yield in the presence of MgSO4 occurs at lower stresses than the brittle peak stresses (Fig.\u00a05e) (i.e.\u00a0different from what is observed for the reference dataset).\nFor 24 h exposure, in the brittle regime, the Na2SO4 samples exhibit similar behaviour to the reference dataset, both in terms of stress magnitude as relative position of the different key stresses to one another (compare Fig.\u00a05a to c). However, at 50 and 200 days exposure time, confining pressure becomes important: where at 7 MPa Na2SO4 values are the same to the reference, at 30 MPa Na2SO4 key stresses are below those of the reference strength (regardless of starting porosity). With 76 MPa, peak stress at 30 MPa is only about half that of dry rock from Castagna et\u00a0al. \n32\n The repeat experiment with XL exposure and porosity on both ends of the spectrum indicated brittle behaviour for the low porosity sample (CL2-8; 8.14% porosity) and ductile behaviour for the high porosity sample (CL22-3; 26.27% porosity). They do exhibit the same brittle peak stress as the ductile yield stress. The ductile yield stresses at 70 MPa fall below those of the reference dataset and those exhibited by MgSO4 samples (Fig.\u00a05f). Overall, the key stresses for the Na2SO4 samples do not exhibit a strong dependence on confining pressure. In both the brittle and in the ductile regime the samples with 200 day Na2SO4 exposure are the weakest in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nStatic and dynamic Young\u2019s moduli\n\nFig.\u00a06 summarizes the ultrasonic velocity measurements done along with the calculated dynamic and static Young\u2019s moduli for each test. As expected, for most experiments, the velocities increase going from the measurement before loading (point 1) to the measurement before failure (point 3), and then decrease at post-failure point 4. This is consistent with the interpretation that between points 1 and 3, microcracks close, followed by linear elastic deformation until unstable crack growth commences (Figs. 4, 5 and side schematic in Fig.\u00a06). This volume modification reduces the elastic wave interaction with the travelled medium, hence leads to increased velocity values. Subsequently, at point 4, the samples have either failed in the brittle regime or were strengthening with displacement in the ductile regime. Either way, a network of microcracks is assumed to have been induced and either led to macroscopic sample failure along the shear plane (brittle regime), or to the expected grain comminution associated with strengthening (ductile regime). As confining pressure increases, the velocity changes within a single sample are smaller, and the overall spread of the velocity measurements taken at one point is narrowing, which likely reflects better contact between sample and transducers. Differences between the static and dynamic Young\u2019s moduli can also be noticed, with dynamic ones being almost always larger than static ones as expected.\n48\u201351\n There is one additional pattern visible, which correlates to ion exposure: at 7 MPa, only the MgSO4 exposed samples have overall higher static than dynamic Young\u2019s moduli (Fig.\u00a06). These differences found in experiments between static and dynamic moduli are usually interpreted to be related to local drainage conditions when the measurements were taken and\/or as a result of non-elastic processes during monotonous loading over a finite range \n\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n Ref.\u00a051. Note there is no specific relation between the ultrasonic velocity measurements and failure class (class I; CL1-9\u00a0\u2013\u00a0XL vs. class II; CL1-8 L and CL2-4 S), nor is there a correlation with sample porosity. These ultrasonic velocity measurements independently confirm that MgSO4 exposure has a measurable impact on the sample at low stress conditions, with a different signature from that of exposure to CaCO3-only or Na2SO4 exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nMicrotomography scans\nWe first qualify the post-mortem sample scale induced damage using 3D reconstructed volumes from micro-tomography scans. Fig.\u00a07 and Movies S1\u2013S4 show the damage within the samples deformed at 7 MPa of confining pressure; Movies S5 and S6 are for the samples deformed at 30 MPa and that failed with large stress drops. Movie S7 show the damage within sample CL2-2 (Na2SO4 exposure for 200 days) deformed at Pc \n=\n 30 MPa that exhibited ductile behaviour. Due to the resolution limit of the scanner of \n\n60\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n per voxel, only the samples with macroscopic damage were scanned (since damage visible to the eye means it is also visible damage in the scanner).\n\n\n\nAt 7 MPa, the reference sample exhibits a fracture network, i.e.\u00a0distributed deformation (Fig.\u00a07a; Movie S1). In contrast, for the samples exposed to MgSO4, the micro-tomography scans reveal strongly localized deformation, where CL2-4 (24 h exposure) exhibits a highly localized shear plane in the form of a single fracture with a narrow (a few voxels wide) to not visible damage zone (Fig.\u00a07b and Movie S2). This is also the sample that exhibited the rapid class II failure. The 200 days exposed MgSO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n sample (CL1-9, Fig.\u00a07c and Movie S3) shows a standard conjugate fracture set. The Na2SO4 sample (CL3-8, 24 h exposure) exhibits distributed deformation similar to the reference sample (Fig.\u00a07d; Movie S4). At 30 MPa confining pressure the samples that behaved brittle exhibit both a fracture network, i.e.\u00a0distributed deformation (Movies S5\u2013S6; MgSO4 and Na2SO4 respectively). For comparison, the Na2SO4 sample that behaved ductile at 30 MPa (Movie S7, CL2-2) only exhibits few internal fractures, none of which crossing through the entire sample width. The microstructural difference in ion species is in line with the observed differences in brittle strength.\nGoing into greater microscopic details, the optical micrograph for CL2-4 (short exposure to MgSO4; class II; single localized fracture) shows a \n\u223c\n\n\n\n200\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n wide zone of grain size reduction next to the central fracture zone (Fig.\u00a07e). The optical micrograph of CL3-6 (short exposure to Na2SO4; class I; distributed deformation) shows multiple fractures infiltrated by epoxy, with a narrow (\n<\n\n\n\n100\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n) zone of grain size reduction near where the sample has split (Fig.\u00a07f). The backscatter electron images further indicate that for both samples the grains near the fracture zones contain many intragranular cracks (Fig.\u00a07g\u2013h).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThis being a carbonate, there is unquestionably sample heterogeneity. This is reflected in initial sample colour (Figure S1), sample wave velocity (Fig.\u00a02), saturated density (Figure S3) and porosity (Section\u00a04.1). However, the only consistent correlation is that Mg-exposed samples are stronger than all other samples. There is no systematic correlation between Mg-exposure and any of the other parameters related to sample heterogeneity. Since porosity does exert a major control on strength, in the following, we discuss the potential effect of porosity, followed by potential explanations for correlations between strength and the different pore fluid chemistries.\n\n4.1\nEffect of porosity\nPrevious research on carbonate rocks has indicated that with an increase in porosity such rock becomes weaker \n\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n Refs.\u00a058\u201361. Most models based on Hertzian cracking of limestones (with cracks starting at pores) indicate that unconfined compressive strength is controlled by porosity and pore size.\n58\u201360\n The pore collapse pressure P* is controlled by the porosity, the size of micropores and the partitioning between micro- and macro-porosity.\n58\u201360\n Due to the different initial porosities of our samples, we need an estimate of the maximum effect porosity can have on limestone strength, in order to determine if the effect of pore fluid type is significant in these samples of variable porosity. To obtain a quantitative estimate of the effect of porosity on strength, we plot the data on UCS and on P* as a function of porosity plus the extrapolations obtained by Baud et\u00a0al. \n58\n on allochemical Leita limestone in Fig.\u00a08. The underlying assumption is that allochemical limestones share microstructural characteristics which control strength variability. Comparing the available models for the effect of porosity on strength in allochemical limestones,\n58\u201360\n it is the extrapolation for P* from Baud et\u00a0al. \n58\n that provides the steepest slope of all available strength\u00a0\u2013\u00a0porosity relationships. This, to our best knowledge, represents the most extreme effect of porosity on strength available for limestones, and thereby can provide us with a maximum \u201cerror bar\u201d.\nWe then separate the peak stress (brittle field) and yield (ductile field) versus mean stress plot of Fig.\u00a05 in three narrow porosity ranges: low porosity (7.5%\u201310%), medium porosity (13.5\u201314.7%) and high porosity (21.5\u201326.3%), in Fig.\u00a09. Many rock mechanics experiments compare results for samples with a porosity varying around 2%, i.e.\u00a0this can then be considered a sufficiently small sample batch to allow comparison. Furthermore, by comparing the strength differences in the models from Baud et\u00a0al. in these porosity regions (intersection of the dashed area with the extrapolation of P* in Fig.\u00a08) we obtain values for an estimated strength variation of 50, 19 and 37 MPa for low, medium and high porosity respectively. Note that if we would use the model for UCS strength, this would be only 16, 6 and 13 MPa respectively. Both estimates of possible strength variations are given on the plot of Fig.\u00a09. In the following, we discuss brittle and ductile failure separately. First, we consider brittle failure. To guide the eye, we have used a simple linear regression analysis to connect the three (Mg, XL exposure, low porosity; Fig.\u00a09a) or two similar data points (Mg, short exposure, and reference samples, medium porosity; Fig.\u00a09b), as an approximation for a failure criterion. Even though this type of interpolation is not statistically robust, it helps to interpolate the results and to quantify the strength differences for a similar mean stress. This clearly shows that XL exposure to MgSO4 leads to an \n\u223c\n80 MPa strengthening compared to XL Na2SO4 exposure (low porosity, Fig.\u00a09a). For the medium porosity, short exposure to Mg leads to a slightly higher strength (\n\u223c\n20 MPa), compared to the reference and Na-exposed samples (Fig.\u00a09b). This is only just outside the 19 MPa variability that can be explained by porosity (Fig.\u00a08), but it is also the sample which failed with class II failure behaviour. This implies there may be a significant effect of Mg-exposure also at short exposure times. Only two of the high porosity samples failed in a brittle manner, and all those tested with high porosity were exposed to Na2SO4. Considering the ductile behaviour, direct comparison of samples within one porosity category is only possible for the medium porosity samples. Short exposure to Mg led to ductile behaviour already at 30 MPa, and the sample is accordingly weaker than the reference or Na-exposed sample. The XL-exposed samples which failed in a ductile manner all exhibit similar yield stresses, despite the large differences in porosity (compare Mg in panel 9a, vs. Na in panel 9c). In future studies on the effect of pore fluid species and limestone failure, we advise to investigate the brittle and ductile failure regime separately, or to obtain more results in the ductile regime.\nTo summarize, our results indicate that the effect of pore fluid type on the failure stress can be significant, and exposure duration and deformation regime exhibit a much larger effect than can be explained by existing initial porosity alone. Ion species affects rock strength in the brittle and in the ductile field, especially with prolonged exposure time (\n\u223c\nhundreds of days). There are significant strength changes in the presence of different ion species: Mg-exposure leads to strengthening compared to Na-exposure. The combination of porosity and confining pressure effects makes it difficult to determine the exact magnitude, but qualitatively, all our observations hold even when considering the potential effect of porosity.\n\n\n4.2\nEffect of pore fluid chemistry\n\n4.2.1\nEffect of CaCO3 saturation\nThe ultrasonic velocities for our CaCO3 saturated samples are in agreement with the range of values by Nicolas et\u00a0al. \n18\n obtained for water-saturated limestone at similar confining pressures. However, in terms of strength, comparing our reference samples with CaCO3-saturated solution to those tested with 24 h exposure to deionized water,\n32\n at 7 MPa confining pressure our samples are \n\u223c\n50 MPa weaker. There is no effect at higher confining pressure or on the brittle\/ductile transition. Taking the extrapolations from Baud et\u00a0al.,\n58\n at from 10%\n32\n to 12% porosity (our data) could explain 36 MPa but not the \n\u223c\n50 MPa difference we found. The strong reduction of strength in the brittle field is intriguing, since previous research has shown a more CaCO3 saturated solution leads to stronger samples, at least at high confining pressure and elevated temperature\n17\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0though these authors did not test fully saturated solutions. Dissolution in carbonate rocks is shown to lead to decreased elastic parameters and is thus expected to lead to reduced strength.\n62\n Since our experiments in the presence of CaCO3 saturated solution are weaker than the samples in partially saturated solution, suggesting as well that dissolution should not have played any role. Both sample sets used by Castagna and by ourselves, come from the same blocks. Microtomography showed for our samples on voxel resolution little difference in internal variations in grey scale within each sample, (assumed to reflect the mineral content and\/or porosity) in the matrix (Movies S1\u2013S7; Figure S4), and visually, samples were similar. Hence, it seems unlikely this difference is simply an effect of sample variability. Excluding then sample variability as a cause, with the current results, we can only provide a hypothesis for this strong weakening at low confining pressure. Previous researchers have brought forward that water weakening in limestones is related to a reduction of fracture surface energy and \n\n\nK\n\n\nIC\n\n\n in the presence of water.\n61\n That surface energy plays a role is also indicated by recent nano-scale studies into the reactivity of the fluid film along a freshly cleaved calcite surface indicate that nano-scale friction and surface forces are strongly influenced by fluid composition.\n63\u201366\n In this type of atomic force microscopy experiments, fully saturated CaCO3 solutions lead to strong repulsive surface forces between two calcite surfaces.\n66\n When CaCO3 solution is mixed with inert glycol, it leads to reduced repulsive forces, and depending on the glycol\/solution ratio even to adhesion between surfaces. Obviously, it is not possible to make a one-to-one comparison between these nano-scale experiments and between glycol\/solution ratio and saturation index, but this does suggest there could potentially be a difference in surface interactions between a partially saturated fluid and a fully saturated fluid, which provides the only potential explanation we are aware off.\n\n\n4.2.2\nEffect of MgSO4 in the brittle field\nThe only two samples that failed in class II mode were samples in contact with MgSO4. Given that all experiments are performed on the same stiff machine, the occurrence of class I vs. class II in this dataset is unlikely to be a machine artefact (i.e.\u00a0related to the stiffness of the piston), and instead should be related to the sample plus fluid. Furthermore, class II failure coincided with strong localization, consistent with He et\u00a0al.,\n41\n who studied class II behaviour in different rock materials. It is difficult to assess the importance of this difference in dynamic behaviour but its occurrence in Mg-exposed samples and not in Na-exposed samples of similar porosity (CL2-4 vs. CL3-8) is noteworthy. Moreover, the ultrasonic velocities indicate that at low confining pressure, the samples with MgSO4 pore fluid exhibited on average the highest post-failure velocities, which correlates to the smallest amount of damage. This is consistent with the increase in key stresses and the increased difference between these key stresses, i.e.\u00a0between the crack initiation stress, the stress at which unstable crack growth commences and the peak stress. Combined, this suggests an increase in cohesion in the brittle field\u00a0\u2013\u00a0visible in the 24 h exposed sample, and even more pronounced in the 50 and 200 day sample. Moreover, all samples in contact with MgSO4 are stronger than those in the reference dataset, and those in contact for 50 and 200 days, are up to 35% stronger than even dry samples. In the following, we discuss potential explanations for progressive alteration with exposure time to MgSO4: either a mineral-to-mineral chemical reaction or a progressive change in surface processes and\/or forces.\nConsidering chemical reactions, since the solutions are saturated with respect to calcite, no dissolution can take place, as confirmed by a PHREEQC batch reaction model. With Mg-ions and calcite, if a reaction would take place, potential reaction products would be Mg-rich calcite and dolomite. A full conversion to dolomite would lead to significant strengthening \n\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n Refs.\u00a034, 35. However, dolomite precipitation is slow even at elevated pressures and temperatures. At 60\u00a0\u00b0C, it takes between 3 and 7\u00a0years for minerals to fully form in a reaction experiment.\n67\n Hence, under the ambient conditions and within the timescale of these baths, there cannot be a complete chemical reaction to either Mg-calcite or dolomite. If experiments would be performed at the right temperature for Mg to enter into the calcite structure, the presence of Mg reduces the thermodynamic stability and thus solubility.\n68\n At elevated temperatures, flushing through Mg-rich solutions has been shown to decrease the mechanical strength of chalk, interpreted to be related to incomplete formation of Mg-calcite because of the high number of defects.\n69\n\n,\n\n70\n Given that we observe strengthening instead of weakening an incomplete reaction to Mg-rich calcite of dolomite is not possible.\nSince chemical reaction between MgSO4 and calcite is ruled out, a potential hypothesis for our results would be a progressive change in surface processes\/forces, related to ongoing diffusion and distribution of Mg-ions into the electrical double layer throughout these porous rocks. The Mg-ion is a dissolution and precipitation inhibitor for carbonates.\n71\n If grain-scale dissolution\/precipitation plays a role in controlling limestone failure, this inhibiting effect may explain why limestones are stronger in the presence of MgSO4. Moreover, the Mg-ion also leads to an increase in zeta-potential of the surface layer.\n28\n It is attached to the Ca-ion through a OH-bridge. This positive charge could lead to increased bond strength, thus explaining the increase in yield and peak strength with Mg-exposure. Along similar lines,\n64\n postulate that the presence of fully hydrated magnesium ions could lead to a significant increase in nano-scale friction, where fully hydrated Mg-ions can penetrate the hydration layer at the surface and form a more rigid hydration shell. A new hypothesis that follows from the here presented work is that it is not water activity,\n19\n but zeta potential that controls failure of soluble rocks, i.e.\u00a0those prone to fluid\u2013rock interactions. We cannot distinguish between these effects with the current results.\n\n\n4.2.3\nEffect of Na2SO4 in the brittle field\nIn comparison to the results obtained with MgSO4, samples in contact with Na2SO4 samples are on average relatively weak (Figs.\u00a05 and 9), particularly against the Mg-exposed sample of similar porosity (Fig.\u00a09a). Compared to the reference dataset, the results are more ambiguous, as relatively few samples of similar porosity have been tested. However, combined with the apparent insensitivity to confining pressure (Figs.\u00a05 and 9) and the distributed deformation (Fig.\u00a07), it may suggest an early onset of the brittle\u2013ductile regime. Note that weakening in the presence of Na2SO4 was also suggested by Bergsaker et\u00a0al. \n26\n for the propagation of cracks through calcite crystals. It has also been shown in mechanical tests of chalk, where weakening by Na2SO4 flooding was attributed to SO4 adsorption to the CO3-ions of the calcite lattice. For an ionic strength of 0.1 the presence of Na2SO4 leads to a negative zeta potential.\n28\n The accompanying repulsive surface charge was postulated before to drive the granular contacts apart.\n23\n\n,\n\n24\n However, given that the Mg-experiments contained an equal amount of sulphate and led to strengthening instead, it indicates that this effect of sulphate is not the whole story: there is an effect of the cation that determines the final effect on failure dynamics and limestone strength.\n\n\n4.2.4\nFrom nano-scale to sample scale\nOn the nano-scale, Atomic Force Microscopy and Surface Force Apparatus experiments have determined the effect of ions on surface forces and friction of nano-surfaces,\n63\u201366\n which is postulated to have implications for deformation of carbonate rocks. These nano-scale results (mostly obtained under room conditions) indicate nano-scale surface forces are affected by the properties of the hydration layer in the grain boundary fluid film, and as such are expected to be significantly affected by ion content. For example, increased concentrations of NaCl lead to increased adhesion between freshly cleaved calcite surfaces\n65\n and decreased friction between sliding calcite surfaces, and CaCl2 solutions promote frictional weakening even more than NaCl.\n64\n Experiments on the nano-scale use equilibration times on the order of tens of minutes\n64\n\n,\n\n65\n\n,\n\n72\n up to hours.\n63\n Going up from the nano-scale, this work was inspired by the significant effect of ion species on crack propagation in cm-sized calcite single crystals.\n26\n The experiments presented here indicate that the effect of ion species on failure of cm-scale limestone samples is also significant, highlighting more research is needed at all sample scales and with various experimental approaches to fully understand fluid\u2013rock\u200b interactions.\n\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe set out to determine the effect of MgSO4 and Na2SO4 solutions, saturated with CaCO3, on the strength of Ragusa limestone (in literature also referred to as Comiso limestone). We have followed a standard rock mechanics approach, and tested visually similar samples using these different pore fluids, as well as reference data samples with CaCO3-saturated solution only. We also compare our samples to literature data on strength of dry and wet Ragusa limestone, obtained from the same blocks.\n32\n\n\nIn the brittle field, we found that a one-day exposure to MgSO4 led to strengthening compared to the reference solution, whereas a 50 and 200 days exposure led to the strongest samples in the dataset, and up to 35% stronger than even dry rock. A one-day exposure to Na2SO4 did not affect sample strength, but a 50 to 200 days exposure led to the weakest samples in the dataset, with about half the strength of dry Ragusa limestone. In the ductile field, both MgSO4 and Na2SO4 led to ductile behaviour also at 30 MPa confining pressure, whereas dry and wet Ragusa limestone undergoes the brittle\/ductile transition at 50 MPa confining pressure. Samples exposed to MgSO4 were more strongly localized than those exposed to Na2SO4, and the 24 h and 50 days exposed MgSO4 samples exhibited class II failure. Moreover, at 7 MPa, the MgSO4 exposed samples have higher post-failure wave velocities (both \n\n\nV\n\n\np\n\n\n and \n\n\nV\n\n\ns\n\n\n) and dynamic Young\u2019s moduli than the other samples. This shows that the effect of ion species is present in all key stresses describing rock failure, as well as being accompanied by changes in failure dynamics and associated geophysical and microstructural changes. Since our samples exhibited a range in porosities, we also consider the effect porosity can have on rock strength. Comparing only the results of samples within an initial 2% porosity range indicates significant strengthening after Mg-exposure. This strengthening of Mg-exposed samples, coinciding with microstructural changes and differences in stress\u2013strain behaviour cannot be correlated to differences in initial sample looks, initial sample density, initial wave velocity or porosity. The conclusion of strengthening with MgSO4 versus Na2SO4 exposure is robust. The simple cation change in the same salt tremendously affects rock strength and failure dynamics. Comparison to geochemical literature and a batch reaction model indicated that conditions of the bathing time and experiment (ambient conditions and duration) are unsuitable to allow for dissolution or mineral reactions.\nEven though these results do not allow to fully determine the cause and exact quantification of the significant change in failure potential, they have interesting implications for geo-engineering scenarios. These new results imply that a reservoir, after influx of chemically different fluids (for example due to use of enhanced recovery methods), can show a different mechanical response within days \u2014 whereas slow geological processes usually take on the order of centuries and millennia. The potential magnitude of the effect of pore fluid chemistry highlights that the field of fluid\u2013rock interaction requires more study at all sample scales, in particular to improve understanding in geo-engineering settings as well as for natural hazards, especially earthquake mechanics.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nA.

Most designs of radioactive waste disposal systems place this material around waste packages or concrete materials.\n1\u20134\n When cylindrical or rectangular blocks of bentonite are stacked, spaces, known as technological voids, may occur between the compacted bentonite and its surrounding materials. Voids can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction in reference to the direction of the compacted bentonite and depending on the construction.\nCompacted bentonites have a self-sealing ability to fill the water-channel gaps in technological voids through saturation-induced swelling. Previous studies have investigated the fundamental swelling characteristics and hydraulic performance of compacted bentonite\u2013sand mixtures.\n5\u20138\n In such studies, sand blends containing bentonite were used with a wide range of Na-bentonite contents, ranging from 5% to 100% (referred to as a no-sand blend). Komine and Ogata\n9\n conducted a self-sealing experiment using a Na-bentonite-rich specimen that sufficiently sealed the technological void and applied pressure on the wall. It is important to assess the breakthrough of drainage between the compacted bentonite and the host rock. Wang et al.\n10\n conducted a hydration test with a technological void at 14% of the total cell volume at the side of a cylindrically compacted Na-bentonite specimen and monitored the axial stress and permeability. Their results indicated that although the initial technological void was filled by swollen soil, permeability increased because the swollen soil contained a loose zone and a weak part with poorer hydro-mechanical resistance in the short term. Dueck et al.\n11\n conducted axial, radial outward, and radial inward swelling tests using compacted Na- and Ca-bentonites with technological voids. After swelling deformation, mainly between 0 and 50% of swelling rate, the average stress calculated from axial and radial stresses, together with the average dry density, agreed with the expected relations from constant-volume swelling pressure tests for Na-bentonite. For Ca-bentonite, if plotted with the average dry density, the average stress was in the same range as that of Na-bentonite at a high dry density, but it was less at a lower dry density. Their results indicated that both the average dry density and the dry density distribution are important when evaluating stresses.\nThe swelling of bentonite is caused by the hydration of montmorillonite. The expansivity of montmorillonite depends on the exchangeable cation.\n12\n Specifically, Na-montmorillonite has a high swelling potential through an osmotic effect,\n13\n\n,\n\n14\n whereas Ca-bentonite exhibits less swelling. In radioactive waste disposal, both types of bentonite are used, depending on the requirements of the facility.\n15\n The swelling pressure and permeability of Ca-bentonite have been experimentally investigated\n16\u201318\n and its one-dimensional swelling deformation has been measured.\n19\n\n,\n\n20\n Liu\n21\n suggested, through numerical modeling, that the swelling deformation induced by inter-lamellar swelling of montmorillonite with divalent exchangeable cations is important for modeling the change in swelling pressure of compacted bentonite. However, theoretical calculation of the osmotic swelling behavior of Ca-bentonite is difficult compared to that of Na-bentonite.\n19\n Therefore, it is important to understand the swelling deformation of compacted Ca-bentonite and the subsequent physical steady state and permeability.\nTo evaluate the long-term stability of the self-sealing property of the compacted bentonite, the physical balance between bentonite and the constraining materials needs to be further investigated. In particular, the process of homogenization of density should be analyzed. Moreover, the effects of bentonite type and the locations of technological voids are important factors in the self-sealing behavior of bentonite, and thus should be evaluated.\nIn this study, the self-sealing behaviors of compacted Na- and Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures were investigated by conducting swelling\u2013permeability tests with specimens containing three types of technological voids. Then, based on the experimental results, the changes in the vertical and lateral pressures and the homogenization of dry density of compacted bentonite\u2013sand mixtures were discussed, and the physical stability of the self-sealing performance was prospectively examined.\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\nThe samples used in this study included Na-bentonite (Kunigel-V1, Kunimine Industries Co., Ltd.) and Ca-bentonite (Kunibond, Kunimine Industries Co., Ltd.), mined from Yamagata and Miyagi prefectures in Japan, respectively. The physicochemical properties of these bentonites are listed in Table\u00a01. The leachable cations, which approximately correspond to the exchangeable cations, were identified after five rounds of leaching with 1 mol\/L-NH4Cl solution. Leachable Na and Ca ions were dominant in each bentonite. The amount of methylene blue absorbed was measured on the basis of the Japanese Industrial Standard\n22\n (JIS Z 2451). Assuming that 140 mmol\/100 g and 150 mmol\/100 g of methylene blue were adsorbed on pure montmorillonite in the Na- and Ca-bentonites,\n23\n\n,\n\n24\n the montmorillonite content was estimated to be 51.4% and 82.7%, respectively. The bentonite was mixed with sand with mixing ratios of bentonite (dry wt%) 20% for Na-bentonite and 30% for Ca-bentonite, considering the provisional investigation of materials for a low-permeability bentonite\/sand layer in low-level radioactive waste disposal in Japan.\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nExperimental procedure\nAn experimental apparatus to measure the vertical and lateral pressures of the specimens was employed to investigate the expansion behavior of the compacted bentonite\u2013sand mixtures during swelling\u2013permeability tests (Fig.\u00a01). The dimensions of the test ring were 60\u00a0mm and 20\u00a0mm in diameter and height, respectively. Two load cells were installed at the upper and bottom of the specimen to measure the vertical pressure induced by swelling. The accuracy of the load cells was 0.2\u00a0kPa, and the maximum load was approximately 700\u00a0kPa. Three pressure gauges were inserted in the center height of a test ring at 120\u00b0intervals to measure the lateral pressure of the specimen induced by pre-compaction and swelling. The accuracy of the pressure gauges was 2\u00a0kPa, and the maximum load was approximately 5000\u00a0kPa. The tip of the pressure gauge, which contacted the specimen, was 8\u00a0mm in diameter. The apparatus was equipped with tubes connected to burettes for the permeability tests. Therefore, it was possible to measure both the change in pressure and the coefficient of permeability of each specimen.\n\nFig.\u00a02 shows the shapes and locations of the technological voids in the mold ring, and Table\u00a02 lists the three types of voids as upper gap (A), surrounding gap (B), and center hole (C). The test ring dimensions include the specimen and technological voids. The specimens were produced by dynamic compaction using 4.5\u00a0kg or 2.5\u00a0kg rammers. The target dry densities of the Na- and Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures were 1.95 Mg\/m\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n and 1.60 Mg\/m3, respectively. Falling of the rammer was repeated until the target dry density was achieved. The compaction energy was approximately 55 MJ\/m3 for the Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixture and 2 MJ\/m3 for the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture. To make the technological void for the upper gap (A), dynamic compaction was executed until the target specimen height (17 or 19\u00a0mm) was achieved in the test ring. For the surrounding gap (B), a mold ring with smaller dimensions was used, and the compacted sample was installed into the test ring. For the center hole (C), the specimen that was directly compacted in the test ring was vertically drilled using 1\u00a0mm or 3\u00a0mm screws. The initial lateral pressure was measured after dynamic compaction or installation of the specimen into the test ring. Deionized water was supplied from the bottom of the specimen with a pressure head equivalent to 0.2 m, and air was displaced out to the top of the specimen by upward infiltration of the water. If the technological void was sealed by swelling of the specimen upon contact with water, the load cell above the specimen or pressure gauges detected an increase.\nAfter confirming that the pressures reached a steady state (\n\u00b1\n0.1\u00a0kPa for more than 3 days), the coefficient of permeability of the specimen was measured. To increase the hydraulic gradient, the hydraulic pressure was applied to the bottom side of the specimen. Because side-wall leakage can occur if the hydraulic pressure is greater than the lateral pressure, it was maintained at a lower value. In addition, the hydraulic pressure was kept lower than the vertical pressure to avoid consolidation. Therefore, the hydraulic gradient was in the range of 67\u2013272 for the Na-bentonite\u2013sand\u200b mixture and 3\u201318 for the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture. Influent and effluent flow rates were measured using the burettes with 25 mL capacity and 0.1 mL accuracy. The coefficient of permeability corrected to 15\u00a0\u00b0C was calculated on the basis of the falling-head test method standardized in ASTM D5084-10.\nAfter the measurement of permeability, each specimen was divided into five or six parts, including the former areas of technological voids (Fig.\u00a03), and the water content of each part was measured according to JIS A 1203. The degree of saturation of the whole specimen, including the areas of former technological voids, was calculated by determining the average water content of the specimen after the permeability test was finished and the hydraulic pressure was unloaded.\n\nThe experimental conditions are listed in Table\u00a02. The swelling ratio is defined as the volumetric ratio of the technological void to the specimen before water adsorption.

The montmorillonite contents of the Na- and Ca-bentonites used in previous studies, which had the same product name as the present study, were assumed to be 51.4% and 82.7%, respectively because no specific values were given in previous studies. The effective montmorillonite dry density after testing was the average value based on the total volume of the specimens previously containing technological voids.\nFor Na-bentonite, the swelling\u2013permeability test was conducted once for each condition. However, because of the low-swelling property of Ca-bentonite, the test was conducted three times for each condition to check the repeatability of its swelling behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults and discussion\n\n4.1\nVertical and lateral pressures\n\n4.1.1\nTechnological void A (upper gap)\nIn the upper 1\u00a0mm of technological void A, the vertical pressure measured at the bottom of the Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixture increased shortly after water was supplied and converged afterward to a constant value of approximately 90\u00a0kPa (Fig.\u00a04a). The upper sensor detected an increase in vertical pressure after five days because the specimen made contact with the sensor after sealing the technological void. Subsequently, a constant pressure of approximately 60\u00a0kPa was obtained. A difference in vertical pressure between the upper and bottom sensors remained at the end of the test. The initial lateral pressure was 25\u2013175\u00a0kPa before the water was supplied, and was low only at sensor B. This indicates that relaxation of a pre-compaction stress can occur unevenly owing to the contact between the sensor and the specimen. The lateral pressures in sensors A and C increased after the value decreased once. This was caused by the hydration and swelling of the specimen. When the vertical pressures became constant, all lateral pressures converged to 124\u2013147\u00a0kPa. In the upper 3\u00a0mm of technological void A, the vertical pressure measured at the bottom increased rapidly and then gradually decreased to approximately 45\u00a0kPa (Fig.\u00a04b), which was lower than that in the case of a 1\u00a0mm upper space. An increase in the vertical pressure at the top was observed after 15 days. As observed in the case of the 1\u00a0mm upper space, a difference in vertical pressure between the upper and bottom sensors remained at the end of the test. The lateral pressure measured before water was supplied was almost the same and changed from 526\u2013574\u00a0kPa to 77\u201391\u00a0kPa. A comparison of these two cases revealed that the lateral pressure at the end of the test decreased as the volume of the technological void increased. The lateral pressure was higher than the vertical pressure in the Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures.\nThe vertical pressure measured at the bottom of the specimen of Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures having a technological void A increased just after water was supplied and subsequently converged to a constant value of approximately 28\u00a0kPa (Fig.\u00a05), similar to the pattern observed for Na-bentonite. The upper sensor detected a slight increase in vertical pressure after four days, which became constant at approximately 1\u00a0kPa. A clear difference in vertical pressure was noted between the values measured by the upper and bottom sensors. The technological void above the specimen was sealed by the swollen soil, although the pressure acting on the upper side was very small when using the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture. The initial lateral pressure at sensor B was 125\u00a0kPa, whereas those at sensors A and C were lower. Similar to the Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, non-uniform relaxation of pre-compaction stress was observed. When the vertical pressure became constant at the end of the test, lateral pressures converged to 48\u201367\u00a0kPa, and the trend showed no relation with the initial lateral pressure. The lateral pressure was higher than the vertical pressure in the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2\nTechnological void B (surrounding gap)\nRegardless of the initial diameter of the specimens of Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, the vertical pressures measured by the load cells at the upper and bottom of the specimen increased just after water was supplied (Fig.\u00a06). Because technological void existed around the specimen, water traveled to the top part of the specimen in a process, comparable to side-wall leakage, and the vertical pressure at the top rapidly increased. Furthermore, almost no vertical pressure difference was noted between the upper and lower faces of the specimens during the test. When the specimen contacted the porous end pieces at the beginning of the test, the vertical pressures measured at the upper and lower faces of the specimen were equal. The equilibrium vertical pressures of specimens 58\u00a0mm and 56\u00a0mm in diameter were approximately 105\u00a0kPa and 63\u00a0kPa, respectively. The vertical pressure of the specimen decreased with the volume of the surrounding gap.\nThe lateral pressure was initially zero because the side of the specimen had no contact with the mold ring. For the specimen 58\u00a0mm in diameter, lateral sensors A and B responded quickly, 10 min and 180 min after water was supplied. The lateral pressure of sensor B decreased by approximately 10\u00a0kPa after about approximately 6 days for an unknown reason and stabilized. It took approximately 360 min to detect the lateral pressure at sensor C. Among three sensors, the lateral pressure at sensor A was relatively higher. It might be relatively strong contact between the specimen and test ring due to rapid increment of lateral pressure. For the sample 56\u00a0mm in diameter, the lateral pressure increased 400\u2013700 min after water was supplied. In both cases, an equilibrium lateral pressure was obtained, and the vertical pressure became constant after two to three days. For the larger sample, the lateral pressure was 86\u2013146\u00a0kPa, with an average of 107\u00a0kPa. Although lateral pressures varied, the average lateral pressure was almost the same as the vertical pressure. The equilibrium lateral pressure in the smaller sample was 53\u201364\u00a0kPa, which is close to the equilibrium vertical pressure.\nVertical pressures for the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, which were measured by load cells at the upper and lower faces of the specimen, increased just after water was supplied, and subsequently converged to approximately 15\u00a0kPa (Fig.\u00a07). Similar to that in the Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, no difference in vertical pressure was observed between the upper and lower sensors. The equilibrium of vertical pressure was approached remarkably earlier than that in the Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures (Fig.\u00a06a). The lateral pressure was initially zero in the specimen with a diameter of 58\u00a0mm. Each lateral sensor quickly responded 10 min after water was supplied, and the lateral pressures gradually increased. The equilibrium lateral pressure was 12\u201320\u00a0kPa, which was close to the equilibrium vertical pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3\nTechnological void C (center hole)\nFor the Na-bentonite\u2013sandmixtures with a 1\u00a0mm center hole the vertical pressures increased just after water was supplied (Fig.\u00a08). The vertical pressure measured by the lower load cell increased quickly, whereas the vertical pressure measured by the upper load cell gradually increased. Because no gap surrounded the specimen, it is presumed that swelling in the top part of the specimen required time for water infiltration. The same change in pressure was observed in the specimen having a 5\u00a0mm center hole; and the vertical pressures measured by the upper and lower load cells converged to almost the same value. The equilibrium vertical pressures of the specimens with 1\u00a0mm and 5\u00a0mm center holes were approximately 137\u00a0kPa and 90\u00a0kPa, respectively. The specimen with a larger center hole exhibited a lower equilibrium vertical pressure.\n\nIn the specimen with a 1\u00a0mm center hole, the lateral pressure was maintained initially at 400\u2013550\u00a0kPa and then gradually decreased. In the specimen with a 5-mm center hole, the initial lateral pressure varied between 200 and 600\u00a0kPa. The non-uniform relaxation of the pre-compaction stress was induced owing to the contact between the sensor and the specimen. After water was supplied, the lateral pressures in the specimens with the larger center hole declined rapidly and then slightly increased and became constant. This indicates that the change in lateral pressure depended on the size of the center hole.\nThe vertical pressures for the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures increased just after water was supplied and became constant within 360 min (Fig.\u00a09). The lateral pressures were initially almost zero, which indicates that the pre-compaction stress was lost through the creation of the center hole. The lateral pressure rapidly increased and became constant within 240 min. The equilibrium vertical pressures measured at the upper and lower load cells were 47\u00a0kPa and 58\u00a0kPa, respectively, and the equilibrium lateral pressure ranged between 90 and 120\u00a0kPa. Thus, the lateral pressure was larger than the vertical pressure in the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures.\n\n\n4.1.4\nComparison of equilibrium pressures in the vertical and lateral directions\nThe relation between the equilibrium vertical pressures measured at the upper and lower faces of the specimen in all experiments is shown in Fig.\u00a010. Except for that in technological void A, the equilibrium vertical pressures measured at both sides of the specimen were approximately equal. For technological void A, however, the equilibrium vertical pressure at the lower face, which is the side supplied with water, was approximately 22\u00a0kPa higher than that measured at the upper face of the specimen. The lower face of the specimen was physically confined by the test ring. Consequently, the swelling pressure was easily increased. In contrast, the upper face of the specimen was initially exposed to the technological void and was not physically confined. The swollen soil filled the initial technological void area at the upper part of the specimen. Deformation occurred under weak confining stress, which tended to result in a small equilibrium vertical pressure at the upper side, if the swelling pressure of the swollen soil was relatively low. For technological voids B and C, both sides of the specimen initially had contacted with the porous end pieces. Because of the symmetrical confining condition of the specimen on both sides, it is presumed that the equilibrium vertical pressures at both sides of the specimen were approximately equal.\nFor technological void B in Na- and Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, the lateral and vertical equilibrium pressures were almost equal (Fig.\u00a011). The bentonite\u2013sand mixture with technological void B expanded and created an isotopic pressure. The specimen was initially exposed to the technological void in the radial direction, and the residual compaction pressures could be released, when the specimen was set in the test ring. In contrast, for technological voids A and C, the equilibrium vertical pressure was approximately less than half the average equilibrium lateral pressure. The lateral pressure tended to be high when the specimen was confined in the radial direction owing to its contact with the mold ring (Fig.\u00a011). The residual compaction pressure is likely the reason for the higher equilibrium lateral pressure, although the pressure was slightly released.\nIn particular, for the Ca-bentonite with technological void A, the equilibrium vertical pressure at the upper face was less than 4% of the average lateral pressure (Fig.\u00a011a). In the compacted Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture specimen, it might be difficult to seal more than a 1\u00a0mm upper gap, which represents 5.26% of the swelling ratio, as evidenced by the slight equilibrium vertical pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nDegree of saturation\nThe water content and the degree of saturation of the specimen measured after the swelling\u2013permeability test are listed in Table\u00a03. The degree of saturation was calculated using the average water content. The measurement points of the water content are illustrated in Fig.\u00a03 and the areas previously containing voids A, B, and C are points 1, 6, and 5, respectively. For the Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, the average water content was relatively higher when the volume of the technological void increased. The water content near the previous position of the technological void was higher than the average water content. The degree of saturation was estimated to exceed 100%. It is likely depended on the water density exceeds 1.0 g\/cm3 in compacted bentonite.\n30\n For Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, the variation in the average water content of specimens with technological voids A, B, and C was within \n\u00b1\n0.2, \n\u00b1\n0.35, and \n\u00b1\n1.5%, respectively, demonstrating the repeatability of saturation. The water content near the previous position of technological void A of the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture was slightly higher than the average water content; that of technological void B was almost the same as the average water content, and that of technological void C exhibited scattered values of the water content. It was difficult to analyze the water content distribution of the specimen with technological void C because the center hole was too small to be distinguished from the surrounding part. The degree of saturation was estimated to be close to or greater than 100% across every observed result.\nDepending on the degree of saturation, the specimens were approximately saturated after the swelling\u2013permeability test, and many showed higher water contents near the previous position of the technological void. Locally, higher water contents indicate a high void ratio and thus a lower dry density. The heterogeneous density distribution was attributed to the previous technological voids in the swollen specimens and it was remarkable in Na-bentonite\u2013sandmixtures. Technological voids B and C might be related to the looser zone oriented parallel to the direction of flow. Because the coefficient of permeability measured in the swelling\u2013permeability test corresponded to that in the constant volume condition (Fig.\u00a012), although the void B of the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture was exceptional in exhibiting a slightly larger permeability due to side-wall leakage, the looser zone had no influence on the overall flow rate and permeability after self-sealing. The permeability after self-sealing can be approximated by determining the average effective dry density of montmorillonite or Na-montmorillonite if the experimental conditions are within those of this study, particularly within a range of swelling ratios of 0.03\u201317.65% (Table\u00a01).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nPermeability\nThe relation between the coefficient of permeability after measuring the equilibrium pressures and the effective montmorillonite dry density is shown in Fig.\u00a012. For comparison with the coefficient of permeability measured in a constant volume condition without a technological void, the results obtained in this study, as well as those reported in previous studies,\n31\u201334\n are plotted in Fig.\u00a012. The effective montmorillonite dry density was calculated using the Eqs.\u00a0(1) and (2).\nSpecimens with a higher effective montmorillonite dry density exhibited lower permeability. Specifically, the permeability of the Na-bentonite was lower than that of Ca-bentonite at less than approximately 0.9 Mg\/m3 in the effective montmorillonite dry density. The permeability of Ca-bentonite markedly increased with a decrease in the effective montmorillonite dry density to values less than 0.9 Mg\/m3. The permeability of the Ca-bentonite-based specimens was 10\u221210 to 10\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n8\n\n\n\nm\u2215s\n\n, which is 102 to 104 times that of Na-bentonite-based specimens. The elapsed time for equilibrating the pressure was shorter in the case of the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture than that in the Na-bentonite\u2013sand mixture (Figs.\u00a04\u20139). Because the compacted Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture had a higher permeability, it is presumed that the expansion of the specimen by water infiltration was rapid.\nThe coefficient of permeability after self-sealing was on the extrapolated line of the relation obtained under conditions of constant volume. Void B of the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixture showed 3- to 10-fold larger permeability than void A at the same density. It is presumed that side-wall leakage affected the flow. Almost no difference in permeability was noted among the types of technological voids, although a maximum 10-fold variation was observed. The permeability of the expanded specimen almost corresponded to the previous data trend obtained under conditions of constant volume.\nThe difference in permeability between the Na- and Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures was likely caused by the difference in swelling properties of the Na- and Ca-montmorillonites. The swelling of montmorillonite has been interpreted to reflect osmotic and crystalline swelling.\n13\n The self-sealing of compacted bentonite was likely to have been induced by both osmotic and crystalline swelling of the montmorillonite. Specifically, in Na-montmorillonite, osmotic swelling induced by static electrical interaction between the montmorillonite layers creates a much larger degree of swelling, in addition to crystalline swelling. In contrast, Fukushima\n35\n showed that Na-montmorillonite in a CaCl2 solution in the Ca-exchangeable condition had an upper limit of interlayer spacing that corresponded to the three-layer hydrate state. This suggests that the crystalline swelling of Ca-montmorillonite is dominant because the degree of osmotic swelling is limited. When larger technological voids are present, the ratio of Na ions to the exchangeable cation of montmorillonite is important. Thus, it is expected that Ca-montmorillonite contributes to self-sealing in smaller technological voids.\nFrom the perspective of the electrical double layer theory, the distribution of the static electric potential is explained by cation valence. The montmorillonite contains Na ions as well as K ions as exchangeable cations. Modeling of swelling characteristics by Komine and Ogata\n19\n treated both Na and K ions as a single point charge of a monovalent cation. Even with the same monovalent cation, expansion of K-montmorillonite occurs in the second water hydrate state,\n36\n and the swelling pressure of K-changed bentonite is significantly lower than that of Na-changed bentonite.\n37\n Therefore, this study focused on the self-sealing of Na-montmorillonite. The effective Na-montmorillonite dry density, defined in Eq.\u00a0(5), is given in the following equations on the basis of the Na-montmorillonite content: \n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nNa\n\u2212\nm\n\n\n=\n\n\nE\nX\n\n\nC\n\n\nNa\n\n\n\n\nC\nE\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ne\nm\n\u2212\nNa\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nb\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\nC\n\n\nNa\n\u2212\nm\n\n\n\n\n100\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n100\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n(\n100\n\u2212\n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\nC\n\n\nNa\n\u2212\nm\n\n\n)\n\n\u2215\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ns\nn\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where CEC is the cation exchange capacity (meq\/100 g), \n\n\nEXC\n\n\nNa\n\n\n is the amount of exchangeable Na ion (meq\/100 g), \n\n\nC\n\n\nNa-\nm\n\n\n is the Na-montmorillonite content (no dimension), \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ne\nm\n-Na\n\n\n is the effective Na-montmorillonite dry density (Mg\/m3), and \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nn\nm\n-Na\n\n\n is the particle density of the non-Na-montmorillonite fraction (Mg\/m3). The effective Na-montmorillonite dry density after testing was taken as the average value calculated using the average effective clay density, \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nb\n\n\n.\nThe relation between the coefficient of permeability and the average effective Na-montmorillonite dry density is shown in Fig.\u00a013. The results of previous studies that considered exchangeable Na ions were compared. Despite the different ionic compositions of bentonite, the coefficient of permeability was correlated with the average effective Na-montmorillonite dry density, including the data obtained in previous studies. Hence, the analysis of the swelling deformation induced by Na-montmorillonite is important for evaluating the permeability of the compacted bentonites, including their self-sealing ability. However, the power approximated line showed variation in the coefficient of permeability, particularly for lower-than-average effective Na-montmorillonite dry densities. For precise estimation of the permeability after self-sealing, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of Ca-bentonite.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4\nPhysical stability of self-sealing\nThe self-sealing ability of bentonite-based materials requires filling of the technological void and maintaining low permeability. To maintain the condition of sealed technological voids, the occurrence of a hydraulic path should be avoided by maintaining the pressure of the bentonite on the wall (e.g.,\u00a0the host rock). Komine and Ogata\n9\n reported that a hydraulic path, referred to as a breakthrough of drainage, can occur when the pressure acting upon the wall becomes smaller than the hydraulic pressure. In the present work, the sealed technological voids are stable against the hydraulic pressure, which is called the physical stability of self-sealing. If the effective montmorillonite dry density of the compacted bentonite after swelling is homogenized, it is easy to estimate the pressure acting on the wall based on the relationship between the effective montmorillonite dry density and the swelling pressure.\n28\n However, there are few experimental studies on the density homogenization of compacted bentonites with technological voids, although the homogenization process of bentonite pellets has been investigated.\n38\u201340\n Dueck et al.\n11\n conducted axial or radial outward swelling tests with technological voids, similar to the present study, and reported that the dry density gradually decreased with distance from the bottom or center of the specimen. The present study also demonstrated the possibility of heterogeneous density distribution remaining in the swollen specimens when the vertical and lateral pressures became almost stable, isotropically or anisotropically. The density distribution most likely remained after self-sealing to maintain its physical balance if external factors, including changeable boundary conditions and pore water chemistry, are not considered.\nThe hydraulic pressure in the swelling\u2013permeability test was lower than the lateral pressure; thus, no breakthrough of drainage was observed. However, void B of the Ca-bentonite\u2013sand\u200b mixture showed a slight increase in permeability. This suggests that the pressure to breakthrough becomes lower when the looser zone is located in the same direction as the flow in the specimen with technological voids B and C. It is important to minimize the gaps (resembling these voids) when constructing bentonite blocks in practice. Moreover, it is important to select the correct ionic type of bentonite depending on the nature of the technical void present. If a small technical void is present, the Ca-bentonite is able to maintain low permeability after self-sealing. For quantitative design against the breakthrough of drainage, it is important to understand the pressure in both vertical and lateral directions according to the flow direction. In contrast to conventional swelling pressure measurements based on vertical pressure, lateral pressures are not equal to vertical pressures in the case of technical voids A and C. It is useful to estimate the coefficient of permeability, based on the average value of the effective dry density of montmorillonite or Na-montmorillonite after self-sealing.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nBy conducting a swelling\u2013permeability test using compacted Na- and Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, the changes in the vertical and lateral pressures, as well as the permeability after self-sealing, were investigated. Three types of technological voids, including an upper gap, surrounding gap, and center hole, were sealed by the swelling of the specimens. The vertical and lateral pressures became stable during the experiments, resulting in equal equilibrium pressure in samples having a surrounding gap. Unequal equilibrium pressures in the vertical and lateral directions were measured when the upper gap and center hole were set. The lateral pressure tended to be higher than the vertical pressure. The residual compaction pressure is likely reason for the higher equilibrium lateral pressure. The coefficient of permeability depended on the average effective montmorillonite dry density in Na- and Ca-bentonite\u2013sand mixtures, respectively. The effective Na-montmorillonite dry density presented a unique relationship with the coefficient of permeability despite the different ionic compositions of bentonite. The effective Na-montmorillonite dry density of the specimen, including the swollen part, represented a unique relation with the permeability after self-sealing, despite the different ionic compositions of bentonite. However, the distribution of water content of the specimen after self-sealing indicated that the dry density of the swollen part was relatively low, despite the steady-state of the pressures. It is most likely that the density distribution remained after self-sealing under its physical balance if external factors, including changeable boundary conditions and pore water chemistry, were not considered. Although the specimen after self-sealing exhibited the possibility of heterogeneous density, its permeability was estimated by using the average effective Na-montmorillonite dry density. If the part showing poor hydro-mechanical characteristics was located in the same direction as that of the flow, for example, the surrounding gap and the center hole, the hydraulic pressure would have more easily exceeded the counter pressure, such as the lateral pressure in the experiment. It is important to reduce the technological void situated in the same direction as that of groundwater flow, and to select the most appropriate ionic composition of bentonite, depending on the technological void, when constructing engineered barriers or physically confining compacted bentonite.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nYasutaka Watanabe: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft.

The key advantage of this testing method with respect to in situ testing is that the effective state conditions (effective stresses) can be monitored, provided that the pore pressure throughout the specimen of porous materials is in equilibrium. This is a challenge for claystones or shales due to their very small pore sizes (tens of nanometres), and ultimately the low permeabilities (nanodarcies or lower). A further complication is the complex chemo-mechanical properties of clay particles. Volumetric changes of test specimens may therefore be related to changes of applied stresses but also from interactions of clay particles with the synthetic brines. In essence, soil mechanical approaches must be considered for triaxial testing of shales but extended to elevated pressures more typical of rock mechanics. The requirements for robust testing for such materials are therefore greater than for conventional rock mechanics testing.\n1\n\n\nWhen considering triaxial testing of shale specimens, three key aspects need increased attention: (1) sampling and handling of core material, (2) ensure saturation of specimens in the rig prior to the deformation phase, and without affecting the specimen\u2019s properties by doing so, and (3) selecting an appropriate loading rate to ensure equilibrated pore pressure across the specimen.\nGuidelines for preservation of shale cores, sampling and handling were recently published by Ref.\u00a02. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the impact of water saturation on the mechanical response of shales. Both strength and stiffness can be significantly overestimated if saturated conditions are not established. Examples can be found in Refs.\u00a03\u201310 for shales and claystone, and in Refs.\u00a011\u201313 for gas shales. However, when saturation is established at low effective stress, this is often associated with significant volume increase and may lead to an alteration of the specimen\u2019s structure and eventually to irreversible changes of its material properties. Clear experimental evidence of this aspect have been reported in several studies related to specimens\u2019 exposure to uncontrolled relative humidity air\n14\u201318\n and synthetic fluid.\n2\n\n,\n\n19\n These studies have confirmed the need of a careful handling of shale cores and test specimens in the laboratory.\n2\n\n,\n\n20\n Finally, the determination of the appropriate loading rate is the critical aspect of shale triaxial testing during shear phase, for both drained and undrained conditions. Deviatoric loading of the specimens is usually performed with a constant axial strain rate, which should be selected such that pore pressure equilibration is warranted within the specimen. This depends on the sample\u2019s capacity to dissipate pore fluid pressure (essentially controlled by its permeability) and the dissipation distance (controlled by sample size and drainage configuration) (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a020, 21). For the case of Opalinus Clay shale, the designated host rock for high-level radioactive waste in Switzerland, Ref.\u00a022 have demonstrated that for undrained testing a strain rate one order of magnitude greater than the one theoretically appropriate for good pore pressure equilibration led to an apparent strength increase of 20% and a decrease in Poisson\u2019s ratio of 70%. The appropriate loading rate should therefore be calculated for each shale under investigation. It should also be the basis for a serious estimation of test duration by service laboratories prior to shale testing campaigns.\nFor the case of Opalinus Clay, triaxial testing procedures were recently improved to respect the above aspects: Ref.\u00a023 focused on securing proper sample saturation prior to deformation, and Ref.\u00a024 in addition ensured this step is not associated with significant volume increase. Finally, Ref.\u00a022 used a different method, pioneered by Ref.\u00a025 and refined by Ref.\u00a026, without the need of adding an external pore fluid for undrained testing, hence avoiding some of the testing complexity. Despite these recent advances, the absence of formal international standards to guide research and service laboratories in shale testing, and the slight differences in the testing methods may still cast doubts on the robustness of some of the applied testing protocols.\nIn this study, a direct comparison of undrained triaxial testing was organized involving three leading service laboratories in shale testing. In a first step, two different testing protocols were adopted, drawing on the recent experience especially by Refs.\u00a022, 24, and honouring all identified key aspects as emphasized above. The ultimate goal was to substantiate that robust and reproducible test results can be achieved by different labs and using different testing methods, thereby increasing confidence in the testing results.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nTesting programme\nThe benchmark study of consolidated and undrained (CU) triaxial testing involved three different laboratories, named in the following as Lab A, Lab B, and Lab C. Different stress paths were adopted in the study, but only the more widely used axial compression tests (increase of axial load while keeping total radial stress constant) are presented in this paper to focus on the testing methodology. To explore the anisotropic structure of Opalinus Clay, the tests were carried out by axially loading the specimens with two different configurations: loading perpendicular (S-tests) and parallel (P-tests) to the bedding orientation. As the study targeted the comparison of the results obtained from tests performed in the same conditions, three different initial effective confining stresses (p\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n) were selected: 4, 10, and 16 MPa. Some deviation from these values occurred for some of the tests, and they are highlighted later in the text. For all the tests, a target pore fluid pressure equal to approximately 5 MPa was achieved to ensure full dissolution of potential air trapped in the system,\n27\n i.e.\u00a0stability of the fluid compressibility.\nAn overview of the experimental programme is presented in Table\u00a01; the three series of tests corresponding to the three different confining stresses are highlighted and a code is given to each test to better identify the data producer (letters A to C), the loading direction with respect to bedding orientation (S or P) and the value of effective mean stress (p\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n) in units of Megapascals at the start of the shear phase. For the S-tests, each lab performed two to four tests and a direct comparison of test results at the same or similar testing conditions (i.e.\u00a0same consolidation stress, pore fluid pressure) was envisaged. In contrast, for the P-tests, only one test was performed per lab (with the exception of Lab C, conducting two tests), and the shear phase in each test was starting from a different effective mean stress. Hence the comparison of test results for P-tests is indirect and focuses on the consistency of the trends of test results.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nTested material and specimen preparation\nOpalinus Clay from the so called \u00abshaly facies\u00bb\n28\n at the Mont Terri underground laboratory was used for the experimental programme. Cores of approximately 30 to 40\u00a0cm length and 10\u00a0cm diameter were recovered from the borehole BGC2 at a coring depth between 29 and 34 m below the tunnel floor, approximately 270 m below ground. The cores were immediately resin-impregnated in a PVC barrel to keep them preserved (cf. Ref.\u00a022). To provide each participating laboratory with very similar core material and to verify core integrity prior to shipping, all cores were analysed using medical X-ray computer-tomography (XCT). Details of the applied XCT method can be found in Ref.\u00a029, and an example of a virtual cross-section of core BGC2-34 is presented in Fig.\u00a01. It is noted that the CT-number is a proxy for material density. The virtual cross-section was the basis to select intervals for sub-coring.\n\nSpecimens\u2019 size for testing was either 19\u00a0mm diameter and 38\u00a0mm length (Lab C) or 25 \n\u00d7\n 50\u00a0mm (Labs A and B) and therefore smaller than typical plug size of triaxial testing in rock and soil mechanics. This was to reduce the drainage path length (during consolidation) and the pore pressure dissipation length (during shearing), respectively, enabling individual tests to be conducted in typically one to two weeks rather than several weeks to months (see Section\u00a02.3).\nThe extraction of the specimens from the cores was done by drilling. Different types of cooling lubricant fluids were used by the laboratories for sub-coring the specimens: Marcol 52 oil (Lab A), Marcol oil 82 (Lab B), and decane (Lab C). Additional measures were taken to improve sampling, e.g.\u00a0Lab B used a floating piston to stabilize the specimen during drilling by the application of a small axial force. The other two labs have the technical means to apply the same procedure but did not consider it necessary for Opalinus Clay. The material was never put in contact with water during the extraction process to avoid possible alteration. Before testing, the prepared specimens were submerged in the cooling fluids for preservation (to minimize water evaporation). For Lab C, the specimens were removed from the hydrocarbon fluid (decane) and placed into controlled humidity vacuum desiccators for three to four weeks, prior to testing. This is explained further in the next section.\nTo assess material heterogeneity of the cores, basic properties and mineralogical composition of tested specimens were also analysed (Table\u00a02). Bulk density (\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nb\n\n\n) was computed from specimen weight and dimensions when placed into the rig. Specimen volume was measured from calliper measurements of the specimens\u2019 height and diameter. Water content (w) was established by oven-drying (at 105 \u00b0C until constant weight) the specimen after testing and dividing the difference between initial weight and dry weight by the dry weight. Grain density (\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ns\n\n\n) and bulk mineralogy (by quantitative X-ray diffraction, QXRD) were evaluated also on tested specimens, but by a contractor external to the benchmark study (University of Berne, RWI group) to avoid analytical discrepancies. In the case of the samples tested at Lab C, only one set of measurements of grain density and bulk mineralogy was performed on a slightly larger specimen compared to those used for triaxial testing to provide enough material for robust analyses. Based on the XCT scans this measurement can be considered representative for all the tested specimens. In the case of Lab B, cylindrical specimens longer than the target height were extracted from the core; the excess material was then cut after the extraction and used for the determination of the water content and bulk density. Porosity (n) was calculated from the densities and the water content, as well as the degree of saturation of the specimens. All specimens exhibited a high degree of saturation (\n>\n90%), which indicates good preservation of the core samples, and adequate methodologies adopted for specimen extraction and preparation. This finding is also supported by measurements of total suction, which is the sum of the matric and osmotic suction,\n14\n of both crushed (Lab B) and intact samples (Lab C), yielding values of relative humidity around 94%\u201395%.\n\nRegarding the mineralogical composition, the results in Table\u00a02 confirm the very low heterogeneity observed in the basic properties among the specimens extracted from one core, and also between the different cores used by the different laboratories. The average mineralogical composition of all examined test specimens is illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. The results of the mineralogical analysis are also consistent with previous studies of Opalinus Clay from the shaly facies in Mont Terri.\n24\n\n,\n\n30\n\n,\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\nTesting procedures\nTwo different testing procedures were adopted to perform undrained triaxial tests. They are named in the following \u201cconventional\u201d and \u201calternative\u201d procedure, respectively, and abbreviated in the following as Conv-procedure and Alt-procedure. The key difference between the two procedures is the fact, that in the Alt-procedure the specimen is never brought in contact with a synthetic pore fluid. This requires a special methodology to achieve sample saturation briefly explained below. A schematic overview of the two experimental procedures is presented in Fig.\u00a03. The graphs refer just to the phases before the shearing.\n\nThe conventional procedure was used by Lab A and Lab B, and it initiated by applying an isotropic total stress (0.5\u20131\u00a0MPa) to the specimen to ensure good contact between the bases of the set-up and the specimen. The saturation of the specimen was then performed at constant volume to avoid possible swelling of the specimen. The specimens were initially put in contact with the fluid at the two bases, where a fluid back pressure of 100\u00a0kPa was applied in the drainage lines connecting the specimen with fluid pressure system of the apparatuses. This process progressively increases the saturation of the specimens or, in case of full saturation of the material, causes a decrease of matric suction generated during the extraction. These mechanisms are responsible for an expansion of the specimens if not properly confined; therefore, to keep the volume of the tested specimens constant, the axial and the radial stresses were independently increased as soon as expansion deformations were detected by the transducers. Conversely, this procedure allowed the determination of the axial and radial swelling pressures, respectively. This procedure is fundamental to ensure that a minimum effective stress is maintained to avoid possible damage of the specimen from volume expansion. It is noted that after extraction from the ground, the cores exhibited high effective stresses at all times due to the generation of negative pore water pressure in the pore space (i.e.\u00a0matric suction). This is indicated not only by theoretical considerations, but also by the total suction measurements on initial core material and the calculated degree of saturation of the specimen (see above), as well as the swelling pressures measured during the saturation process.\nOnce the process stabilized, the confining stress was set equal to the axial stress and the fluid back pressure was increased to 2 MPa to dissolve possible air bubbles still remaining in the pore space\n27\n and the total stresses were also increased to keep the effective stress constant (Fig.\u00a04). The assessment of the specimens\u2019 saturation was carried out by measuring the Skempton\u2019s B coefficient.\n32\n Three isotropic undrained loading steps (1 MPa stress increase for each of them) were usually performed in the tests. The B coefficient was calculated as the ratio between the measured increase of the pore fluid pressure (\n\u0394\nu) and the applied increase of the total mean stress (\n\u0394\np). At the end of the last measurement, the pore fluid pressure was set equal to 5 MPa if this target value was not reached during the three loading steps before. Drained consolidation of the specimen to the target consolidation stress (p\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n) was then performed. The pore fluid pressure was kept constant to 5 MPa during consolidation and the consolidation coefficient was determined for the estimation of the appropriate loading rate during the shear phase (see below). The final phase of the test was the shearing of the specimens at constant axial strain rate until specimen\u2019s failure and achievement of the ultimate condition (post-peak). Peak was defined as the maximum deviator stress experienced by the specimens. Unloading\u2013reloading\u200b cycles were also carried out before and after peak with an axial strain amplitude of 0.001. The stress variation during these cycles was applied to the specimen with same axial strain rate adopted for the main shearing phase. All the tests performed with the conventional procedure used a synthetic pore fluid prepared according to Ref.\u00a033. The synthetic pore fluid was composed of demineralized water and different salts with the following concentration: 6.7356\u00a0g\/l NaCl, 0.0456\u00a0g\/l NaHCO3, 1.7510\u00a0g\/l CaCl2 2H2O, 0.1902\u00a0g\/l KCl, 1.8635\u00a0g\/l MgCl2 6H2O and 3.4089\u00a0g\/l Na2SO4.\n\nThe Alt-procedure was used by Lab C, and examples of this experimental procedure can be found in Refs.\u00a020, 22, 26. This procedure can avoid the direct injection of the external synthetic fluid to perform the saturation process. Instead, it exposes the specimens to different relative humidity values (between 96% and 98% for this specific study) in desiccators before testing to achieve different fluid saturation conditions. As a precautionary measure, specimens equilibrated at 98% relative humidity were inserted into a porous hard-plastic cage to prevent potential swelling of the material and allow the water exchange through the vapour phase. The cage prevents the swelling in the axial direction. Due to the high initial fluid saturation (\n>\n90%), which corresponds to values of relative humidity similar to those adopted for the equalization process (96%\u201398%), the swelling of the specimens during the equalization to the imposed relative humidity was negligible and it did not generate any issue in removing the specimens from the cage. The water contents presented in Table\u00a02 refer to the specimens after the equalization in the desiccators. The specimens were then mounted into the rig; in this phase, the specimen was in contact with a very small amount of de-aired inert fluid (0.4 ml) used to fill the drainage lines. Then, an initial undrained isotropic loading was carried out until an increase of the fluid pressure was detected. During this phase, the fluid in the voids of the specimen is expected to flow out avoiding the penetration of the fluid in the drainage lines. The loading of the specimen was carried out until the achievement of a target pore fluid pressure (2 MPa). The measurement of the Skempton\u2019s B coefficient was then performed with the same protocol adopted for the Conv-procedure. To avoid exposure to a synthetic pore fluid in this particular study, drained consolidation was not applied, although it can also be executed if necessary. Therefore, the effective mean stress at the start of the shearing phase differs slightly from the starting values of the Conv-procedure. The shear phase was then executed as in the Conv-procedure at a constant axial strain rate and including two unloading\u2013reloading cycles before and after failure of the specimens in most tests.\nAll the laboratories used accurate systems to monitor the specimens\u2019 deformations during the tests. All the transducers were placed inside the rigs and in direct contact with the specimens to avoid the influence of the apparatus\u2019s compliance during the application of the mechanical stresses. Lab A adopted two axial and two radial LVDTs. The two radial LVDTs are positioned at the lower and upper third point of the specimen, and they are oriented 90\u00b0apart. The internal local measurement of vertical strain is then obtained by recording the change in distance between the two horizontal strain sensors by two axial LVDTs. Lab B used three LVDTs for the axial displacement and two strain-gauged cantilevers at mid-height of the specimen for the radial displacement. Lab C implemented a system composed of eight strain-gauged cantilevers. This system allows the evaluation of the strains, both axial and radial, from the bending of the cantilevers induced by the displacements experienced by the specimen. Four cantilevers were used for the measurement of the axial strain and four more measured the orthogonal diameter changes. In the case of specimens tested parallel to bedding (P-tests), the configurations adopted by the laboratories allow the evaluation of the radial strain in the directions both perpendicular and parallel to bedding. Regarding the measurement system of the radial strain, for the Lab A and Lab B the stems are brought through the sleeve and put in direct contact with the specimen, while for the Lab C the stems are in contact with the sleeve. Additional details related to the testing layouts can be found in Refs.\u00a020, 22, 34, 35. The accuracy and efficiency of these systems were carefully assessed with calibration tests performed on a synthetic material (peek). All the calibration tests were performed at a total confining stress of 10 MPa and included three loading\u2013unloading cycles carried out up to a deviatoric stress equal to 10 MPa. The values of the elastic properties obtained by the three laboratories are summarized in\u00a0Table\u00a03, and they demonstrated the good capability of the testing set-ups in providing robust measurements.\n\nA summary of the strain rates adopted by the three laboratories to perform the undrained shearing phase is presented in Table\u00a04 for the S-tests and in Table\u00a05 for the P-tests. The selection of the appropriate strain rates is fundamental for equilibration of the pore fluid pressure across the specimen for robust determination of the mechanical properties in terms of effective stresses. This aspect was widely investigated in recent works on shales where the methodologies proposed in Refs.\u00a036, 37 were considered for the estimation of the strain rate. The key factors required for the theoretical estimation of allowable strain rate are the size of the tested specimens, the coefficient of consolidation (\n\n\nc\n\n\nv\n\n\n), the drainage configuration, and the estimated axial strain to failure. The size of the specimens has a pronounced effect on the strain rate, and for this reason the laboratories used sizes smaller than conventional as mentioned above. The evaluation of the \n\n\nc\n\n\nv\n\n\n coefficient was performed during the consolidation phase of the tests carried out with the conventional procedure (Lab A and Lab B), yielding a value of approximately 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129 m2\/s in the stress range relevant for the compression tests. This value is also consistent with previous findings on the same material.\n31\n All the laboratories used lateral drains in order to allow faster pore fluid pressure equalization in the specimens. The Lab A used four drains made of vyon (porous plastic material made of polyethylene), while the Lab B and the Lab C implemented drains made of permeable metal strips. The connectivity of the lateral drains was previously verified with specific evaluation test. According to the methodology presented in Ref.\u00a036, a drainage coefficient of 64 and a drainage path length equal to the radius of the specimens were therefore used for the calculation. The axial strain at failure was considered to be equal to 0.01. Based on these considerations and on the different size of the specimens adopted by the laboratories, an appropriate axial strain rate for undrained loading of approximately 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 s\u22121 was obtained for Lab A and Lab B, and approximately 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 s\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n for Lab C, respectively. As reported in Tables\u00a04 and 5, much lower strain rate values were however adopted for the performance of the tests; this choice was considered as a precautionary measure to ensure a correct evaluation of the pore fluid pressure also in the case of limited efficiency of the side drains caused by the elevated confining stress. In particular, Lab A and Lab C used strain rates approximately one order of magnitude lower than the theoretical value, while Lab B adopted strain rates approximately 2\u20133 times lower.\n\n\nAll laboratories performed the undrained tests with very small dead volumes of the fluid pressure system (\n\u2264\n2.2 ml) to minimize effects of system compliance for the measurement of fluid pressure. This is relevant not only during the shearing phase, but also for the assessment of the Skempton\u2019s B coefficient. In addition, a reliable assessment of the fluid pressure requires the minimization of temperature fluctuations. The tests were performed at room temperature, and measures were taken to reduce and control the temperature variations typically within 1\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nThis section presents selected results of the performed tests as representative examples. Summary plots of all test results are introduced and discussed in Section\u00a04.\nThe results are illustrated referring to the effective mean stress (p\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n) and deviator stress (q) as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\na\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n+\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nr\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\na\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nr\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\na\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nr\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n are the effective axial and radial stress during the loading of the specimens. The adopted convention for the strains (axial \n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\na\n\n\n, radial \n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nr\n\n\n, volumetric \n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nvol\n\n\n) is positive for compression and negative for extension. The maximum value of q during a test sequence is denoted as q\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n (for \u00abfailure\u00bb), as all tests exhibited strain-weakening. Accordingly, the value of p\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n at q\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n is referred to as p\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n (cf. Tables\u00a04 and 5); in the tables the deviator stress and mean effective stress are defined also for the post-peak condition achieved after failure (i.e.\u00a0constant deviator stress) as q\n\n\n\npp\n\n\n and p\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\npp\n\n\n\n.\nTo evaluate the hydro-mechanical response of the tested specimens, the pore pressure parameter AB\n32\n was also considered: \n\n\n\nAB\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nu\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nq\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\u0394\nu\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n is the variation of the pore fluid pressure and \n\u0394\nq is the variation of deviator stress, both measured from the beginning of deviatoric loading.\n\n3.1\nSaturation phase\nEstablishing specimen saturation in the rig was particularly delicate in the case of the Conv-procedure where volume expansion of the specimens by direct contact with the synthetic fluid had to be counteracted by simultaneously raising axial and radial stress. An example of this initial phase of the tests is presented in\u00a0Fig.\u00a04 (test AS10b performed by Lab A). The graphs (a) and (b) illustrate the evolution in time of the stresses (axial and radial) and the fluid pressure, and the strains (axial and radial). The graph (a) in Fig.\u00a04 shows the initial low isotropic stress acting on the specimens (1 MPa). Then a small fluid pressure was applied (about 80\u00a0kPa) to carry out the re-saturation process. Due to the imposed constant volume conditions, the development of the swelling stresses was observed. The graph (b) in Fig.\u00a04 highlights the evolution in time of the recorded deformations. The strains were indeed extremely small (\n\u2264\n0.01%) and demonstrated the good capability in limiting the expansion of the specimens in both directions. A slight expansion was observed in the radial direction, and it stabilized after about 18\u00a0h. The development of the swelling pressure in graph (a) shows a more pronounced stress in the axial direction (perpendicular to the bedding) than in the radial direction (8.5 MPa against 5.6 MPa). Once the stresses and strains stabilized, the fluid pressure was raised to 2 MPa to enhance the saturation process (the two stresses were also raised to keep the effective stress constant). The small strains experienced by the specimen demonstrated that the procedure was suitable to properly re-saturate the specimens without inducing relevant volumetric deformations that could have altered the porosity of the specimens and ultimately its mechanical response.\nThe saturation phase of the tests included also the measurement of the Skempton\u2019s B coefficient. As presented in Section\u00a02.3, the measurement of the Skempton\u2019s B coefficient was performed in steps by increasing the total mean stress in undrained conditions. An example of this phase is presented in Fig.\u00a05 (test CS7, Lab C). The specimen was here loaded in three steps, with an increase of the total isotropic stress of 1 MPa. The considered fluid pressure for the calculation of the B coefficient was evaluated when a good stabilization was achieved during each step; this condition was usually observed after few hours from the stress application and it is consistent with the method reported in Ref.\u00a022. When a stabilization was not observed (see Section\u00a04.1), the fluid pressure was evaluated after two hours from the starting of the undrained loading. The three obtained values of the B coefficient were within the range \n\u00b1\n0.06, with an average value of 0.95. At each step, the B coefficient was calculated using the maximum measured fluid pressure. This result supported the assumption that the specimens achieved a stable saturated condition. Similar responses were observed also in the other tests, and a summary of all the B coefficients measured in the performed tests is presented in\u00a0Section\u00a04.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nShearing behaviour\n\n3.2.1\nS-tests\nA representative example of test results for the shear phase of an S-test is provided in Fig.\u00a06 for test BS10, loaded from an initial effective mean stress of 10 MPa. Different graphs considering the stresses, strains, pore fluid pressure variation, and AB parameter allowed a comprehensive diagnostic interpretation of the material response. The maximum values of deviator stress (max q, equal to q\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n), pore fluid pressure change (max \n\u0394\nu\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n), and AB parameter (max AB) are also indicated in each graph. These points allowed the subdivision of the shearing in three principal stages (cf. Ref.\u00a022): (i) from the starting of the shearing to the max AB point, (ii) from max AB point to the max \n\u0394\nu\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n point, and (iii) from the max \n\u0394\nu\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n point to the max q point. The graphs also illustrate the two unloading\u2013reloading cycles performed before and after the achievement of the maximum deviator stress for the evaluation of the elastic properties of the specimen (cf. Section\u00a03.3).\n\nThe graph (a) in Fig.\u00a06 shows the relationship between the axial stress and the axial strain and highlights the nonlinear response of the tested specimen. This nonlinearity was related to the elasto-plastic hardening behaviour of the material before the achievement of the maximum deviator stress. This feature was well highlighted by irreversible axial deformation exhibited during the unloading phase of the stress cycle performed before the failure of the specimens. A Similar nonlinear response was also observed in the radial direction in the graph (d) (Fig.\u00a06); the graph only shows the deformation up the peak stress because after the failure of the specimen the local measurement of the radial strain could not be considered anymore representative of the real material\u2019s response. Once the maximum deviator stress is achieved, a rapid stress decrease was experienced by the specimen. This stress drop was interpreted as a brittle response of the tested specimen. The shearing of the specimen then continued until the achievement of the post-peak (or ultimate) condition where constant deviator stress was exhibited. The achievement of the maximum deviator stress was considered to be representative of the specimen\u2019s failure. The failure can be related to the development of a discrete shear fracture across the specimen as evidenced by post-testing visual inspection (Fig.\u00a07). This observation is representative for all tests. The different colour of the specimens in the picture is related to the different lighting conditions in the laboratories and not to the mineralogical composition.\n\n\nThe max AB value is evaluated in graph (f) in Fig.\u00a06 and it is manifested in graphs (c) (fluid pressure versus axial strain) and (e) (deviatoric stress versus fluid pressure) by progressive deviation from linearity above this value. At the deviator stress corresponding to the max AB value, the rate of fluid pressure increase reaches a maximum. Fluid pressure is still increasing with additional loading, but a lower rate per increment in deviator stress or strain. Both graphs (c) and (e) also clearly illustrate that the maximum value of fluid pressure (max \n\u0394\nu\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n) was achieved well before the maximum deviator stress. This aspect indicates that failure of the specimen was associated to a dilation mechanism and it can be related to the generation of the shear fracture. These features suggested that the max AB point can provide an indication of the onset of the failure process in the material. This evolution of the fluid pressure during shearing affected significantly the effective stress path. The graph (b) in Fig.\u00a06 illustrates the relationship between the deviator stress and the effective mean stress. The evolution was marked by an initial decrease of the effective mean stress, followed by an increase up to the achievement of the maximum deviator stress.\n\n\n3.2.2\nP-tests\nA representative example of test results for the shear phase of a P-test is provided in Fig.\u00a08 for test AP12, loaded from an initial effective mean stress of 12 MPa, i.e.\u00a0similar to the S-test in Fig.\u00a06. A very different hydro-mechanical response was exhibited in the P-tests with respect to S-tests. In contrast to S-tests, no irreversible deformation is observed in an unloading\u2013reloading cycle in comparison with initial loading. The axial strain to failure was less than 50% of the strain in the S-test at similar effective stress. The maximum value of the pore fluid pressure variation experienced by the specimen was about 2 MPa, significantly lower than in the S-test (about 6 MPa in the graph (c) of Fig.\u00a06). The lack of significant additional pore fluid pressure generated during loading means that pore pressure was not sufficient to induce a significant reduction of the effective mean stress as in the case of S-tests.\nThe max AB cannot be identified with confidence as in the S-test (Fig.\u00a06f). Therefore, the use of the max AB point to evaluate the onset of the plastic behaviour in P-tests must be considered with caution. A key aspect is that the pore fluid pressure reaches a maximum at almost the maximum deviator stress. This means that the fluid pressure increased almost up the failure of the specimen, and the rate of increase changed only significantly shortly before reaching the maximum value.\nAfter testing, the inspection of the specimens highlighted the presence of a clear shear fracture as in S-tests (Fig.\u00a09). The fracture was always crossing the bedding planes of the specimens and axial splitting was never observed. In particular, the shear fractures showed a higher inclination with respect to the radial direction compared to the specimens in S-tests, indicating a slight influence of the bedding orientation in the testing configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nElastic response\nThe elastic response of the tested specimens was evaluated on the performed unloading\u2013reloading cycles during the shearing phase before and after achieving q\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n. All the computed parameters (elastic moduli and Poisson\u2019s ratio) refer to undrained conditions considering linear anisotropic elasticity.\nThe unloading phase of the cycles allowed the typical determination of the secant undrained elastic modulus (E\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\n), which was computed as the ratio between the axial stress interval (\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\na\n\n\n\n) and the corresponding axial strain variation experienced by the specimen (\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\na\n\n\n\n), for both the pre- and the post-peak response, in spite of the presence of clear fracture planes in the latter case. The stress\u2013strain curve is found to be significantly non-linear, meaning that a greater unloading increment will result in lower apparent E\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\n value. Therefore, small-strain moduli (E\n\n\n\nu\n\u03b5\n\n\n) were also evaluated from the stress cycles according to the procedure by Ref.\u00a038 and applied with minor modification for the Opalinus Clay by Ref.\u00a022. An example of its determination and comparison with the secant moduli E\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\n is presented in Fig.\u00a010 for the S-tests BS16 (Lab B) and AS10a (Lab A). The graph shows the evolution of the secant modulus with the axial strain during the unloading phase of the cycles performed before (cycle pre-peak or unload 1) and after (cycle post-peak or unload 2) failure (q\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n). A clear nonlinear decrease of the stiffness was observed as the axial strain range used for the calculation increased, which reflected the nonlinearity of the material\u2019s response. The graphs highlighted the strain dependency of elastic stiffness where higher small strain values (E\n\n\n\nu\n\u03b5\n\n\n) with respect to secant values (E\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\n) were systematically observed. The importance of the axial strain range adopted to perform unloading\u2013reloading cycles is illustrated in the graph (b) of Fig.\u00a010, where different axial strain ranges led to different moduli. Generally, larger axial strain ranges lead to lower moduli (both E\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\n and E\n\n\n\nu\n\u03b5\n\n\n). As an example, the values of E\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\n computed on the unload 2 interval at an axial strain of 0.001 yields 2.8 GPa, while at a strain of 0.0037 (end of the unloading) it yields a value 1.6 GPa. For this reason, an axial strain range of 0.001 was selected in most of the performed tests for both cycles before and after the peak stress in order to have a consistent evaluation of the elastic parameters. Indeed, larger strain interval would have led to additional variations of the moduli negligible compared to the overall range exhibited by the material during the unloading. When higher strain intervals were used (as for the unload 2 in the graph (b) of Fig.\u00a010), the moduli were evaluated for the target axial strain of 0.001.\n\nFig.\u00a011 shows an example for the P-test AP12 (Lab A). A trend similar to that observed for the S-test in Fig.\u00a010 is exhibited also in this case. The graph highlights the higher stiffness of the material with respect to the results in the graph (a) of Fig.\u00a010. Note that the initial effective mean stress in the two tests BS16 and AP12 is different by 6 MPa, but the effective mean stress at the start of unload 1 is comparable (13.1 MPa and 13.3 MPa, respectively). This result demonstrates the anisotropic elastic response of Opalinus Clay. Moreover, the graphs in Figs.\u00a010 and 11 highlighted also systematic lower values of the moduli measured on the cycle performed after the peak stress (unload 2). This highlights the importance of avoiding specimens\u2019 damage to derive robust elastic parameters representative of the intact material.\n\n\nIn terms of radial response, the relationship between axial and radial strains (Fig.\u00a012) during the unloading phase of the cycles performed before the achievement of the maximum deviatoric stress was used for the assessment of the undrained Poisson\u2019s ratio (\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n\n\n). The graph (a) in Fig.\u00a012 shows an example of the relationship between the two strains during the unloading phase of the cycles of the S-test BS16. For the determination of the undrained Poisson\u2019s ratio, nearly perfect linear relationship over the entire unloading phase was observed between radial and axial strains. Similar linear trends were observed also for the other S tests. The analysis of the radial response in the P-tests revealed a significant anisotropic response of the tested specimens. Indeed, the presence of the bedding planes in the axial direction influenced significantly the response of the specimens in the two orthogonal directions in the horizontal planes; in particular, a higher strain in the direction perpendicular to bedding than in the direction parallel to bedding was always observed. An example of this behaviour (for the test BP4) is presented in the graph (b) of\u00a0Fig.\u00a012. Also in this case a linear relationship was observed for both radial strains, and a value of undrained Poisson\u2019s ratio could be computed for each direction (perpendicular \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n,\n\u22a5\n\n\n and parallel \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n,\n\u2225\n\n\n to bedding). This feature of the Opalinus Clay behaviour highlighted the importance of measuring the radial deformations in the two orthogonal directions, one aligned with the bedding plane, for a proper evaluation of the elastic response during P-tests.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion and comparison\nIn this section a comparison of the benchmark test results is presented in summary graphs. The comparison first focuses on the saturation phase, then the elastic response, and finally the shearing behaviour. Moreover, Tables\u00a04 and 5 summarize the test conditions and results for both S- and P-tests, respectively.\n\n4.1\nSaturation phase\nA summary of the Skempton\u2019s B-coefficients measured by the different laboratories is provided in Fig.\u00a013. The values are reported against the effective mean stress acting on the specimens. As three steps were usually performed in each test to evaluate the B coefficient, the average of the three measurements is presented in Fig.\u00a013, and in\u00a0Tables\u00a04 and 5. Values higher than 0.8 were systematically obtained by the Lab B and Lab C, and they indicated a good consistency of the experimental results. Differences between the values measured at the different steps were in the range \n\u00b1\n0.06, suggesting that both the conventional and alternative procedure was appropriate to re-saturate the tested specimens.\n\nLower values were measured by Lab A, and more significantly the pore fluid pressure was decreasing with time at a rate of about 100\u00a0kPa over 24\u00a0h after the initial increase in response to the mean stress step increase of 1 MPa (Fig.\u00a014a). A detailed calibration of the testing set-up late in the testing programme confirmed that the pressure loss occurs through dissipation across the specimen sleeve at a rate of approximately 2 to 14\u00a0kPa per hour. The nitrile rubber membrane used as sleeve was therefore replaced by a Viton membrane in test AS10b, essentially a repeat of AS10a but with the different membrane (Table\u00a01). In this case, fluid pressure did not drop anymore after a mean stress step increase (Fig.\u00a014b). However, the low B-values exclusively measured by Lab A are difficult to be explained by fluid pressure loss across the membrane only. It may be speculated that some air may have been trapped in the system (e.g.\u00a0the side drains) at the start of the Skempton-B tests, leading to greater fluctuations and lower B-values due to lower water compressibility after dissolution of air bubbles in the pore fluid. Another possible explanation could be a lower stiffness of the system (pressure transducer, tubing, filters etc.).\n\n\nTest AS10b was the only one carried out by Lab A with a Viton rubber sleeve, while all the other tests were performed with nitrile rubber sleeve. The leakage across the sleeve also impacted in the development of the pore fluid pressure during the loading of the specimens in tests of Lab A, as is discussed in Section\u00a04.3.\n\n\n4.2\nElastic response\nA summary of all the elastic parameters obtained from the benchmark campaign is illustrated in this section to highlight the general consistency of the results obtained by the different laboratories and validate the experimental procedures. As specified in\u00a0Section\u00a03.2, all the presented values of the elastic moduli and Poisson\u2019s ratio refer to undrained conditions and were mainly evaluated on the unloading phase of the unloading\u2013reloading cycles before and after the maximum deviatoric stress.\nThe graphs in Fig.\u00a015 summarize the different elastic moduli obtained from the S- and P-tests. The graphs show the secant moduli E\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\n measured before (Cycle pre-peak) and after (Cycle post-peak) failure, the small strain moduli E\n\n\n\nu\n\u03b5\n\n\n evaluated on the cycle before the peak stress, and the primary loading moduli E\n\n\n\nu0\n\n\n evaluated at the beginning of the shearing of the specimens. The moduli E\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\n and E\n\n\n\nu\n\u03b5\n\n\n were plotted versus the effective mean stress acting on the specimens at the starting of the unloading, while the primary loading moduli E\n\n\n\nu0\n\n\n were plotted versus the effective mean stress acting on the specimens at the starting of the shearing. A good consistency of the values obtained by the different laboratories is observed. The following three main systematic features could be highlighted: (i) the dependence of the moduli on the mean effective stress (p\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n), (ii) the decrease and lack of a clear stress-dependance of the secant elastic moduli after failure of the specimens (Cycle post-peak are lower than Cycle pre-peak, graph (a) in Fig.\u00a015), (iii) the influence of the strain range cosidered to obtain the moduli (Small strain moduli are greater than Cycle pre-peak moduli, graph (b) in Fig.\u00a015). The elastic anisotropic response of Opalinus Clay is also highlighted in the graph (d) of Fig.\u00a015. The specimens loaded parallel to bedding (P-tests) exhibited much greater values of the undrained elastic moduli compared to the S-tests. The anisotropy factor between 2 and 3 is consistent with findings on drained tests by 21.\n\n\nRegarding the Poisson\u2019s ratio, a summary of the obtained values for the S- and P-tests is presented in Fig.\u00a016. As for the elastic moduli, these values were plotted versus the effective mean stress acting on the specimens at the starting of the unloading phase. In the case of the S-tests, the values of \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n\n\n were in the range between 0.30 and 0.55. It is noted that values in excess of 0.5 are plausible given the anisotropic response of Opalinus Clay, as the maximum theoretical value of 0.5 applies to linear isotropic elasticity. The following two ranges were identified for the P-tests: 0.2\u20130.4 for the direction parallel to bedding (\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n,\n\u2225\n\n\n), and 0.6\u20131.0 for the direction perpendicular to bedding (\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\nu\n,\n\u22a5\n\n\n). The radial anisotropic response was observed in all the P-tests carried out by the three different laboratories. Finally, the cycles carried out after the failure of the specimens were not considered for the evaluation of the Poisson\u2019s ratio, as the geometry of the failure plane affects the local measurement of the radial displacements. A summary of the key undrained elastic parameters is presented in Tables\u00a04 and 5, where the secant values of the elastic modulus and the Poisson\u2019s ratio measured on the cycles before failure are reported.\nThe apparent systematic difference in Poisson\u2019s ratio values among the different labs might reflect slight differences in material properties for each lab\u2019s core section, or might be due to specific combinations of specimen size, dead volume related to the drainage configuration and loading rate. As reported in\u00a0Section\u00a02.3, calibration tests (blind cross-check) using a standard peek material resulted in identical Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio results from the different labs.\n\n\n4.3\nShearing behaviour\nConcerning the S-tests, the three graphs in Fig.\u00a017 show a direct comparison of the stress\u2013strain relationships for the three series of tests performed at similar initial effective confining stresses. It is noted that for Lab C, the initial effective confining stress is slightly different (p\n\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n=\n7\n\n instead of 10 MPa, and 17 instead of 16 MPa, respectively), but the test results of Lab C are plotted at the closest effective stress levels of tests performed by the other labs (graphs b and c in Fig.\u00a017).\nSimilar stress\u2013strain responses were observed in the tests performed by the different laboratories, reaching failure at an axial strain of approximately 0.02. In particular, the graph (a) in Fig.\u00a017 illustrates the similar response of two S-tests carried out by Lab A and Lab B, both using the conventional procedure. A good agreement between Lab A and Lab B was also observed in the graph (b) in Fig.\u00a017 for test AS10b. The apparent lower stiffness exhibited in the test by the Lab C may largely be attributed to the lower effective stress (cf. graph (a) in Fig.\u00a017). Graph (c) of\u00a0Fig.\u00a017 highlights the broad consistency of the results obtained with the conventional (Lab A and Lab B) and alternative (Lab C) testing procedures for tests performed at near identical initial mean stress. The apparent lower peak strength of Lab A in Fig.\u00a017c is discussed further below.\nProbably the best overview of test results is granted when the effective stress paths (deviatoric stress versus effective mean stress) are considered. This is done for all S-tests in Fig.\u00a018, grouped by tests from all three laboratories. All stress paths are qualitatively similar in shape, with a decrease of the effective mean stress in the initial part, followed by an increase in the second part until reaching the maximum deviatoric stress. As mentioned in the previous section, the right curvature indicated that the failure of the specimens was related to a dilatant behaviour. The evolution of the fluid pressure during shearing was systematically discussed for the S-tests in Section\u00a03.2.1 (cf. Fig.\u00a06c), and the equivalent curves for all other S-tests are summarized in Fig.\u00a019, again grouped for the three series corresponding to the different stress levels as in Fig.\u00a017. Again it is highlighted that the apparent lower pore pressure generation by Lab C in graph (b) of Fig.\u00a019 can be explained by the lower effective stress level (cf. Figs. 19a, 18). The graphs of Fig.\u00a019 illustrate the nonlinear evolution of the fluid pressure for all the tests during shearing, with the achievement of the maximum value well before the achievement of the maximum deviator stress. In addition, a stabilization of the fluid pressure corresponding to the post-peak or ultimate condition was reached in almost all the tests. The similarity of test results between Lab B and Lab C starting from near identical stress level is striking, both in effective stress path (Fig.\u00a018) but also when plotted as pore fluid pressure generation with strain (Fig.\u00a019c). It is emphasized again that Lab B uses the conventional testing method and Lab C the alternative method.\n\n\nTest results by Lab A yielded similar, but somewhat lower strength (Fig.\u00a017) and fluid pressure generated during loading (Fig.\u00a019) compared to the other two laboratories. This systematic shift appears to be in part related to the fluid pressure loss in the membrane as discussed above. However, Figs.\u00a018 and 19 demonstrate that the repeat test AS10b changes only marginally the pore pressure evolution and the stress path during shear compared to AS10a. Material heterogeneity (cf. Section\u00a02) is unlikely to explain the small difference in test results of Lab A compared to the other labs (cf. Figs.\u00a018 and 19). It may be speculated that some micro-fissures were present in the initial core or induced during sub-coring. But no systematic trend which would support this interpretation is seen in the derived elastic properties (Figs.\u00a015 and 16). System compliance could also be a relevant aspect as discussed under Section\u00a04.1. It appears that the difference in excess pore pressure generated during the tests in comparison with the other two labs increases with increasing effective stress (Fig.\u00a018). Yet another possible explanation could be, that the side drains used by Lab A do not sufficiently dissipate pore fluid pressure generated and hence measured at the fluid pressure sensor. It is true that Lab A did use the lowest strain rate of all laboratories (Table\u00a04), but indeed, if the side drains\u2019 contribution to equilibration of pore fluid pressure would be restricted or inhibited entirely (e.g.\u00a0clogged by indentation into the specimen) a strain rate of approximately 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 s\u22121 would be required. This would be lower by a factor of two to three than the strain rates used (Table\u00a04).\nThe good agreement of the test results between all laboratories is even more compelling for the P-tests (Fig.\u00a020). Although the tests were performed at different values of initial effective confining stress, the consistency of the experimental results was highlighted by the relationship between the axial stress and axial strain (graph a) in Fig.\u00a020, and by the effective stress paths (graph b) in Fig.\u00a020. Indeed, all the performed P-tests exhibited the same linear evolution of the effective stress path, with an increase of the effective mean stress during loading. Moreover, all the specimens experienced an increase of the fluid pressure almost up to the achievement of the maximum deviator stress, corresponding to the failure of the specimens. These two aspects marked the most important differences with respect to S-tests and were observed in all the P-tests performed with both the conventional and alternative procedures.\n\nThe obtained results demonstrated the robustness of theadopted testing procedures and their capability in providing consistent experimental results. The observed hydro-mechanical response in both S- and P-tests highlighted the capability of both experimental procedures in re-saturating the specimens before the shearing phase. In particular, limiting the volumetric expansion of the specimens below values of 0.1% during the re-saturation in the conventional procedure was demonstrated to effectively prevent possible damage due to the swelling induced by the wetting process.\n\n\n\n5\nDerivation of material\u2019s parameters\nTracking the fluid pressure evolution during the undrained loading phase is fundamental for the identification of the processes governing the response of the specimen up to failure, and to derive robust material parameters. The positive results from diagnostic analyses and agreement of test results as discussed above lend strong support for derivation of robust material parameters based on undrained triaxial testing. In the following, material strength parameters are derived from the test results assuming a simple elasto-plastic material law, fitting Mohr\u2013Coulomb strength parameters for the Opalinus Clay.\n\nFig.\u00a021 presents the results for the S-tests. Three different regressions are illustrated in the graph: peak strength (referring to the max q points), maximum pore fluid pressure (referring to the max \n\u0394\nu\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n points) and maximum AB (referring to the max AB points). The corresponding values of effective intercept cohesion (c\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n) and mobilized shear strength (\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n) are reported in the figure. The graph demonstrates the evolution of these parameters during the different phases of deformation. An increase of both the effective cohesion and mobilized shear strength was observed from the starting of the shearing until reaching failure. This indicates a hardening behaviour of the material with apparent mobilization of cohesion and friction up to failure. The max AB envelope highlighted the stress state when the material started to experience a reduction of the rate of increase of the pore fluid pressure, and it can be associated to the onset of the plastic behaviour of the specimens during shearing. The max \n\u0394\nu\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n and max q envelopes show similar values of c\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n, meaning that most of the hardening during the shearing occurred before the achievement of the maximum pore fluid pressure. The good linear trend exhibited by the max q points suggested a good consistency of the results.\n\nFig.\u00a022 illustrates a final comparison between the S-tests and P-tests for both peak and post-peak strength values. The specimens tested parallel to bedding (P-tests) exhibited slightly higher peak strength than the specimens tested perpendicular to bedding (S-tests). This aspect is mainly related to the effective cohesion, which increased from 2.1 MPa for the S-tests to 3.8 MPa for the P-tests, while the mobilized shear strength did not change significantly (see values reported in Fig.\u00a022a). This feature was not explicitly reported in previous studies on the Opalinus Clay from Mont Terri,\n24\n\n,\n\n39\n where one single set of strength parameters was defined for both S and P-tests.\n\n\nData related to the post-peak condition were processed taking into account that, as a consequence of the failure, the specimen was divided into two blocks which slid on the inclined shear surface. The normal effective stress \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n and the shear stress \n\u03c4\n, acting along the shear surface, were calculated evaluating the interaction between the blocks. Moreover, the evolution of the contact surface with the axial displacement was considered. The linear trend of experimental points reported in the \n\u03c4\n-\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n plane highlights a good overlapping between the two orientations (perpendicular and parallel to bedding); a unique set of Mohr\u2013Coulomb strength parameters was identified and reported in\u00a0Fig.\u00a022b. This feature was supported by the observed failure plane in the specimens after testing, which was crossing the bedding in both testing configurations, indicating that post-peak strength should indeed be very similar for the two configurations. The reduction of c\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n to a value close to zero once again suggests a good consistency of the test results. Then, a reduction of both c\n\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n is observed in the post-peak envelope with respect to the peak envelope (Fig.\u00a022b); this feature indicated the weakening of the material\u2019s response after failure and the degradation of the material\u2019s strength. The obtained effective strength parameters for the peak and post-peak envelope are indeed similar to those reported in drained tests by Ref.\u00a024.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nA benchmark experimental study on undrained triaxial testing of the Opalinus Clay was presented. Sample heterogeneity could largely be excluded by detailed inspection of initial cores and confirmation of basic properties and mineralogy of the tested specimens. Sample handling and specimen preparation, and saturation of the specimens were performed very carefully to minimize volume changes and hence potential of specimen damage. The appropriate loading rate was determined, and tests executed with additional margin (lower rate than calculated as appropriate).\nOn this basis, three different laboratories using two different testing procedures (conventional and alternative) produced very similar test results. The two testing procedures differ for the saturation methodology, where the conventional procedure foresaw fluid injection at constant volume, while the alternative procedure adopted the material equalization to a given value of relative humidity prior to an isotropic undrained compaction. Minor discrepancies in test results appear to be related mainly to technical execution of the testing procedures (membrane initially used by Lab A). The comparison confirmed that both of the adopted testing procedures were sound. The validated test results lend additional confidence in the determination of hydro-mechanical material parameters.\nMost importantly, the study demonstrates that robust and reproducible results can be achieved in triaxial testing of shales.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAlberto Minardi: Formal analysis, Writing - original draft.

These systems belong to the category of low enthalpy geothermal plants and are combined with heat pumps and\/or district heating systems. A number of practical applications of this technology are already operational especially in Austria, Germany, United Kingdom and Switzerland.\n3\u20138\n\n\nThe development of these dual use sub-structures, so called energy geostructures, started with piled foundations, and experience of energy piles now goes back over three decades.\n5\n Analysis and design methods have been developed both for thermal aspects\n9\u201311\n and the geomechanical considerations that follow from the additional temperature changes that will be developed within the pile.\n12\u201314\n However, recent trends in energy geostructures include the adoption of embedded retaining walls and tunnels for geothermal utilisation.\n15\u201319\n Of these types of structure, energy walls are closest to routine implementation, with the tunnel applications so far only acting as small scale trials.\nHowever, implementation of energy walls in practice has mainly been accompanied by the use of numerical methods for thermal analysis, often in a research context.\n20\u201324\n Routine analysis and design methods for energy capacity are currently lacking. Consequently, this paper aims to provide the first design charts for energy walls based on the anticipated ground properties (hydraulic and thermal conductivities), and ground conditions (groundwater temperature and flow velocity). Section\u00a02 provides a review of existing analysis methods and Section\u00a03 presents the numerical model used in the paper. Sections\u00a04 and 5 introduce the results of the analysis and present the design charts themselves, while Section\u00a06 compares the results obtained to available field data and the performance of other energy geostructure types.\n\n\n2\nAnalysis methods for energy walls\nThe first proposal for analytical methods for the design of energy walls was made by Ref.\u00a025. Their model assumed 2D plane heat conduction within the wall and the surrounding ground. Two horizontal cross sections were used, one above and one below the excavation line, with a convective boundary condition for the inside face of the retaining wall. Point heat sources are assumed at the pipes and Green\u2019s functions used to provide a solution to the diffusion equation. The model was validated using field data from the Shanghai Museum of Nature History.\n26\n However, at time periods under 12\u00a0h when step changes in demand are likely to occur in practice, the model fit to the field data is poor.\nRef.\u00a027 developed and validated an analytical model for design of energy walls based on resistances and capacitors in a network set up to represent the positions of the pipes within the wall. However, numerical simulation was still required to derive the resistance values. A network approach was also used by Ref.\u00a028 who applied the Dynamic Thermal Network (DTN) approach to energy walls. The DTN method uses a response factor approach to describe the relationship between temperature and heat fluxes at surfaces within the thermal network. However, the method requires weighting factors for heat fluxes to be calculated numerically hence limiting its routine application. Nonetheless the approach was successfully tested against a full scale field experiment.\nRef.\u00a029 have also developed a thermal resistance model for application with energy walls. The model provides shape factors for a rectangle (the wall) with an offset hole (a heat transfer pipe). The approach is analytical, assuming either isothermal or convective boundary conditions, and could be applied with step response methods for the ground around the wall. Initial development of a step response model for walls has been undertaken by Ref.\u00a030. However, this preliminary study is still lacking full development and validation before it can be applied.\nDespite these developments, none of these methods have yet been adopted in practice. With the exception of the resistance model,\n29\n most require application of complex integrals, or use of numerical simulation for some sort of calibration. Furthermore, other than these few cases, reported analysis for energy walls is based entirely on numerical methods and largely based around research projects. Typically, numerical methods are based in three dimensions and used 1-dimensional special pipe elements for the heat transfer pipes and the fluid within them.\n20\n\n,\n\n22\n\n,\n\n31\n\n,\n\n32\n A similar approach is adopted in this paper for development of the design charts, and is described in detail in the next section.\n\n\n3\nNumerical model\nThe numerical approach used in this paper is based on the thermo-hydro mathematical formulation implemented in the finite element software FEFLOW\u00a9, with the 1D elements to represent the pipework also available in the same software.\n33\n\n,\n\n34\n This approach was validated for the case of energy walls by Ref.\u00a022, by comparing against the experimental results provided by Ref.\u00a026. A full description of the model, including governing equations is given in Ref.\u00a022. The following sections focus instead on the details of this specific case.\n\n3.1\nModel geometry and pipes configuration\nThe geometry of the model is based on the literature, using average standard dimensions and considerations highlighted by Ref.\u00a022. From literature, typical wall depths vary in the range of 10 to 40 m, while thickness is usually 0.8 to 1.2 m.\n22\n Thus, the approximate mean values have been selected as representative here, i.e.\u00a020 m depth and 1 m thickness.\nThis type of retaining geostructure is characterised by a portion of the whole length exposed to the air of the excavation environment. It has been highlighted that the ratio between the panel height and the excavation depth does not play a major role in the energy performance of the system.\n22\n Consequently, for simplicity, a fixed excavation depth of 10 m was used in this analysis. The typical range of the wall panel lengths is between 2.25 and 4 m, hence a 2.5 m length panel is assumed. Fig.\u00a01 shows a perspective view of the finite element mesh, as well as the vertical and the horizontal section of the wall. The model is 60 m high, 120 m long. This length is to allow for the inclusion of groundwater effects. In the third dimension the wall is 2.5 m wide (one panel). The model includes 405460 triangular prismatic six-node elements, 224191 nodes and a spacing between the slices in the third dimension of 0.25 m. The appropriateness of the mesh was checked through a sensitivity analysis.\nThe shape of the pipework installed in energy walls are quite standard and from the literature a U-shape (single or in a W-shape) can be defined to be the most common.\n22\n\n,\n\n26\n\n,\n\n31\n\n,\n\n35\n However, in some cases a \u201cslinky\u201d shape of the tube system has been chosen after optimisation analyses.\n15\n\n,\n\n22\n\n,\n\n23\n\n,\n\n31\n The limits for this type of pipe arrangement are construction practicalities: slinky pipework is practicable only if there are no cage joints, otherwise fusion welding is required to join the pipes every cage splice. Therefore, as a result of a compromise between construction feasibility and optimisation of heat exchange, the W-shape configuration has been selected for this analysis with a total length of the pipe of about 80 m.\nEven though some previous studies indicated that installing heat exchangers also on the excavation side can be useful,\n22\n\n,\n\n26\n in this numerical simulation the geothermal loop will be considered on the retained side of the wall only, as is more common. The pipes are of 25\u00a0mm external diameter and 2.3\u00a0mm thickness. To have the heat absorbers installed as close as can be practically achieved to the soil, the concrete cover to the pipes is 50\u00a0mm.\nPipe spacing has proved to play a main role in the energy performance.\n22\n It is suggested, for the long term and a balanced heating\/cooling, an optimal pipe spacing is 40\u201360\u00a0cm.\n36\n This is similar to recent analysis,\n32\n which recommended 50\u00a0cm to 70\u00a0cm. Therefore a representative value of 50\u00a0cm has been chosen for this model. The defined pipework configuration is represented in Fig.\u00a01b and c.\n\n\n3.2\nHeat carrier fluid assumptions\nThe pipework was reproduced by 1D elements with a Hagen\u2013Poiseuille law. To simulate the heat exchange process through the pipe loop, the fluid flow rate and inlet temperature must be specified. In this study, a constant inlet temperature and constant fluid flow were specified to facilitate calculation of reference heat transfer rates after a 30 day period of constant operation. This approach was taken to allow comparison of different ground conditions.\nRef.\u00a037 show that the dependence of the heat transfer rate on the fluid velocity is not linear and for every pipe configuration an optimal velocity exists. From the experimental test conducted by Ref.\u00a026, an optimal velocity of 0.6 to 0.9 m\/s has been evaluated. However, Ref.\u00a022 shows that, within typical values of 0.2 to 1.2 m\/s, this parameter does not have a significant effect on energy performance. In this study, a value of 0.4 m\/s has been used, as per.\n34\n Note that the model neglects the pipe resistance in the analysis. However, this value is typically small and this approach has been shown to be appropriate in previous analyses.\n22\n\n\nRegarding fluid temperature, in operational conditions it will vary according to energy demand and the external temperature. For the sake of simplicity and in accordance with\n34\n the imposed inlet temperature in operating conditions is set equal to 4\u00a0\u00b0C for winter (heating mode) and 28\u00a0\u00b0C for summer (cooling mode) for the duration of the 30 day numerical simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nMaterial properties\nSome sets of parameters were maintained as fixed within the model and some were varied as part of a sensitivity analysis. Since the aim of the analysis was to consider the effect of the ground conditions on the energy available, parameters pertaining to the wall concrete, fluid flow (see Section\u00a03.2) and geometry (see Section\u00a03.1) were fixed. Table\u00a01 outlines all the fixed material properties, while Table\u00a02 outlines the variable parameters. Generally the ground conditions were taken to be reflective of the in situ conditions in Torino, Italy, to be comparable to previous studies on energy tunnels\n34\n\n,\n\n38\n. While it is acknowledged that the concrete thermal properties may affect the outcome with some significance, this area was included in the topic of previous work and hence typical mean values were used in this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\nInitial hydraulic and thermal conditions\nGroundwater flows are known to play a primary role in the heat transfer, because it allows a continuous thermal recharge of the ground with benefit to heat extraction and injection efficiency. It is introduced in the model by applying a hydraulic head gradient between two opposite borders of the domain, and initialising the model to get the hydraulic equilibrium (Darcy\u2019s law).\nThe direction of groundwater flow is another variable which should be considered.\n39\n Nonetheless, to limit the longitudinal dimension of the wall to a single panel, a water flow perpendicular to the wall was considered here. It is thought that in such a short extension (one wall panel only), the influence of the flowing groundwater parallel to the wall may not be correctly reproduced. It may be of interest to examine in further investigations how parallel water flow can influence the efficiency of energy walls.\nThe values of initial ground water flow and temperature are part of the sensitivity analysis and are given in Table\u00a02. Different values of groundwater flow velocity are obtained by keeping permeability constant and changing the hydraulic gradient.\n\n\n3.5\nBoundary hydraulic and thermal conditions\nA schematic representation of the adopted boundary conditions is presented in Fig.\u00a02. The hydraulic heads imposed on the model boundaries to initialise the model are kept constant during the simulations.\nThe temperature on the bottom and lateral boundaries of the model is fixed equal to the initial domain temperature throughout the simulation. These boundaries were checked to be far enough away not to influence the results.\n\nThe temperature on the ground surface varies between day and night, day by day, season by season, but for simplicity, in this paper a constant value of 2\u00a0\u00b0C for winter and a constant value of 30\u00a0\u00b0C for summer were adopted. The two vertical sides, front and back of Fig.\u00a02, are considered as adiabatic assuming interaction with adjacent wall panels.\nThe boundary condition on the excavation side (wall and bottom of the excavation) is expected to influence the heat exchange\n22\n\n,\n\n24\n. For this reason, two conditions were investigated in this study. Each may be taken as close to end members for the possible range of thermal behaviour:\n\n\n\n\u2013\nFixed constant temperature (Dirichlet boundary condition) equal to 20 and 10\u00a0\u00b0C, for summer and winter respectively. This condition allows maximum heat flow across the boundary and is representative of high airflow velocity (>3\u20135\u00a0m\/s) inside the excavation (e.g.\u00a0the case of metro cut and cover tunnels and stations);\n22\n\n,\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\nImposed convective heat transfer through the wall and slab boundary (Cauchy boundary condition) \n\n\nq\n\n\nw\n\n\n, such as: \n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\nw\n\n\n=\nH\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\ne\nx\nc\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\nw\na\nl\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere H is the heat transfer coefficient which is reasonably varying between 2 and 20 W\/m2\/K,\n24\n while \n\n\nT\n\n\nexc\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nwall\n\n\n are the temperatures on the excavation boundary (imposed) and of the wall\/slab (determined during the computation). This type of conditions allows to consider intermediate situations between an \u201copen\u201d boundary (i.e.\u00a0imposed temperature, or H tending to infinity) and adiabatic conditions (H=0), depending on the value of the heat transfer coefficient. Imposing constant temperature could be non-conservative with respect to heating capacity, although if airflow in the excavation is faster than 3 to 5 m\/s (as it might occur for instance in cut and cover tunnels), this assumption will not be too far in error. Studies where a heat transfer coefficient approach is adopted are summarised in Ref.\u00a022, together with the evaluation of appropriate H values. Justification for this approach can also be found in ISO 6946\n40\n where surface heat transfer coefficients are provided for internal and external spaces in the built environment. ISO 6946 also gives guidance on linking air speeds to heat transfer coefficients. Data related to tunnel internal temperature are also available in the literature and are summarised in Refs.\u00a022, 41. These vary seasonally, generally in response to the external air temperature, and are usually higher than the original undisturbed ground temperature. Based on these considerations, in this study, the coefficient H was assumed equal to 2.5 W\/m2\/K, to represent a lower bound heat transfer condition, while not being as conservative as an adiabatic condition\n42\n that may be unlikely to occur in reality. \n\n\nT\n\n\nexc\n\n\n was fixed to 20 and 10\u00a0\u00b0C, for summer and winter respectively. This condition is representative of near-zero airflow velocity inside the excavation (basement and underground parking).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6\nSimulation steps\nAfter the hydraulic initialisation, the operational conditions of the geothermal system were simulated by circulating the fluid in the pipes at a given inlet temperature and velocity. Each simulation lasted 30 days. The heat Q (expressed in W) extractable during winter and injectable during summer was computed as: \n\n(2)\n\n\nQ\n=\nm\n\n\nc\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nT\n\n\nw\no\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\nw\ni\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere m is the mass flow rate expressed in kg\/s, \n\n\nc\n\n\nw\n\n\n is the circulating fluid heat capacity in J\/kg\/K, \n\n\nT\n\n\nwi\n\n\n is the inlet (imposed) temperature of the pipe circuit and \n\n\nT\n\n\nwo\n\n\n the outlet temperature (result of the numerical simulation). In this paper, the circulating fluid is assumed to be water and \n\n\nc\n\n\nw\n\n\n is taken equal to 4200 J\/kg\/K.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nThe effect of the three investigated parameters are discussed and quantified in the following paragraphs, for both the thermal boundary conditions on the excavation side.\n\n4.1\nReference case\nAs a reference condition, the case with initial soil temperature equal to 14\u00a0\u00b0C, no underground water flow and bulk soil thermal conductivity of 2.26 \n\nW\n\u2215\nm\n\u2215\nK\n\n was considered. The results in terms of heat exchanged (Eq.\u00a0(2)) during one month simulation are presented in Fig.\u00a03, for winter and summer conditions, and for both the thermal boundary conditions assumed on the excavation side. The heat exchange per unit surface area of the wall in contact with the ground is considered, i.e.\u00a0Q is divided by 20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5 m2, for the sake of comparing with other theoretical studies, field data, and generalising the results. The heat exchange of the upper part of the wall (exposed to air on one side), and the embedded lower part are therefore considered together. This approach is supported by the results presented in Ref.\u00a022, where the effect of the ratio between the panel height and the excavation depth on the heat exchange potential was investigated. Varying this ratio between 1.25 and 2, the authors concluded that it has limited importance on the heat exchange potential of the wall panel in the long term, compared with other design parameters.\nFor the fixed temperature boundary condition, at the end of the 30 days, the difference in temperature between the inlet and the outlet of the pipes circuit was 1.9\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.4\u00a0\u00b0C for summer and winter respectively, resulting in values of exchanged heat of 21.2 W\/m2 (injected) and 15.3 W\/m2 (extracted). For the heat convective boundary conditions, the difference in temperature between the inlet and the outlet of the pipes circuit was 1.7\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.2\u00a0\u00b0C for summer and winter respectively, resulting in values of exchanged heat of 19.1 W\/m2 (injected) and 13.6 W\/m2 (extracted). These values (Table\u00a03) confirm a reduced efficiency in the case of convective heat boundary condition by approximately 10 to 12%, due to the limited heat exchange allowed on the excavation side, with respect to the temperature fixed boundary condition. However, the bigger difference in performance is between the summer and winter conditions. The better performance of the system in summer was expected due to the higher absolute difference between the inlet and the initial ground temperature (\n\n|\n\u0394\nT\n|\n\n), which was of 14\u00a0\u00b0C in summer and 10\u00a0\u00b0C in winter.\n\n\nMonitoring data of existing operating systems are generally limited in the literature\n2\n\n,\n\n43\n. Among the data available, the only comparable with the numerical results were found to be those presented by Ref.\u00a016 and\u00a0Ref.\u00a026. To consider comparable conditions between the monitoring data and the numerical computations, it is worth considering the difference in temperature between the undisturbed soil and the inlet: \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n|\n\u0394\nT\n|\n\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\nw\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the simulations realised in this work, it was equal to 14 and 10\u00a0\u00b0C, for summer and winter respectively. Ref.\u00a016 reported monthly heat extraction values between 12.5 and 14.9 W\/m2 for a real scale and operational diaphragm wall heat exchanger in a building basement, with soil bulk thermal conductivity of 2.2 W\/m\/K, inlet temperature around 4\u00a0\u00b0C and monitored soil temperature of 13.4\u00a0\u00b0C (\n\n|\n\u0394\nT\n|\n\n\n\n\u2248\n 10\u00a0\u00b0C), which is reasonably comparable with the 13.6 W\/m2 and 15.3 W\/m2 found in this work for the convective heat boundary condition and for the fixed temperature boundary condition respectively.\nRef.\u00a026 carried out field thermal performance tests of a W shaped diaphragm wall heat exchanger with heat injection values between 68 W\/m2 and 73 W\/m2, for a bulk thermal conductivity of 2.34 W\/mK, an inlet temperature of 32\u00a0\u00b0C and undisturbed soil temperature of 16.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\n\n|\n\u0394\nT\n|\n\n\n\n\u2248\n 16\u00a0\u00b0C). Fig.\u00a03 highlights that the difference between the two cases is not that significant. Some of this difference is due to a higher \n\n|\n\u0394\nT\n|\n\n in the field experiment, but the larger effect is likely to be the test duration (Ref.\u00a026 ran their test for only 50\u00a0h, compared to the one month long simulation).\nIt is interesting to compare these results with those obtained on energy tunnels through the same approach and under the same conditions (\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n=14\u00a0\u00b0C, \n\n\u03bb\n=\n2\n\n.26\u00a0W\/m\/K, no ground water flow, \n\n\nT\n\n\nwi\n\n\n=4\/28\u00a0\u00b0C for winter\/summer, fluid velocity of 0.4 m\/s, fixed temperature boundary condition). The results in terms of heat exchange are surprisingly similar (refer also to Section\u00a06). In the case of an energy tunnel, the heat extracted\/injected was 11.4\/16.0 W\/m2\n\n34\n, so slightly lower than 15.3\/21.2 W\/m2 obtained in this case for the fixed temperature boundary. Since this difference is small, it could relate to geometric factors such as the pipe arrangements and spacing (which is 30\u00a0cm rather than 50\u00a0cm), tunnel curvature, and absence of the embedded section with soil on both sides of the structure. All these factors are known to effect the heat availability in energy geostructures (e.g.\u00a0Refs.\u00a022, 43).\n\n\n4.2\nInfluence of ground temperature\nThe simulation was repeated by varying the undisturbed ground temperature between 8 and 18\u00a0\u00b0C and keeping all the other parameters unchanged. The heat exchanged values at the end of a one-month period simulation, for summer and winter conditions, and for the two mentioned excavation-side boundary conditions are compared in Fig.\u00a04a, as a function of the undisturbed ground temperature. In summer, the increase in soil temperature reduces the temperature difference between the undisturbed ground and the inlet (which is constant at 28\u00a0\u00b0C), and as a result the efficiency decreases. The opposite trend is shown in winter mode. As already observed, the heat transfer boundary condition limits the heat exchange through the excavation boundary, induces a temperature increase\/decrease in summer\/winter on the wall internal boundary, and a consequent decrease of total heat exchange. The measurements presented by Ref.\u00a016 are in good agreement. The variation of the injected\/extracted heat with undisturbed ground temperature is linear, as highlighted in Fig.\u00a04b which shows the relationship between the heat exchanged and the absolute temperature difference between the fluid entering the wall and the ground undisturbed temperature. This also demonstrates that the direction of heat transfer (i.e.\u00a0the season) is unimportant and that this absolute difference (\n\n|\n\u0394\nT\n|\n\n) is the key factor.\n\n\n4.3\nInfluence of thermal conductivity\nThe second parameter that was investigated was the bulk thermal conductivity of the soil, varying between 0.9 \n\nW\n\u2215\nm\n\u2215\nK\n\n and 3.9 \n\nW\n\u2215\nm\n\u2215\nK\n\n. The heat exchanged at the end of a one-month simulation, for summer and winter conditions, and for the two internal air boundary conditions are compared in Fig.\u00a05 as a function of thermal conductivity. In all conditions, the expected increase of exchanged heat with the thermal conductivity is more significant in summer (where \n\n|\n\u0394\nT\n|\n\n is higher) for both boundary conditions. The influence of the excavation boundary condition is limited in this case: the increase in heat exchange is roughly independent on the boundary condition assumed. The measurements presented by Ref.\u00a016 are once again in good agreement and seem to be better reproduced by the heat convective boundary condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4\nInfluence of ground water flow velocity\n\nFig.\u00a06 illustrates the effect of groundwater flow velocity ranging between 0 m\/day (reference case) and 2 m\/day on the energy efficiency of the system, for winter and summer modes and both the excavation side boundary conditions. As expected, both in heating and cooling mode, the exchanged heat increases in a non-linear way with the increasing of groundwater flow velocity. This increase is much less significant than for the case of energy tunnels, where\n34\n show the heat transfer rates in the presence of groundwater flow to reach maximum values of 57.7 W\/m2 and 80.7 W\/m2 in the winter and in the summer respectively, under identical soil thermal conductivity, permeability, hydraulic gradient and temperature. This difference is thought to be due to the geometry of these structures (Fig.\u00a07): the wall actually acts as a dam, limiting considerably the flow along the wall face and the consequent beneficial thermal recharge. Fig.\u00a07 shows that the far field flow rate of 1.4 m\/day is reduced to only 1\u00a0cm\/day near the top of the wall because of the dam effect. The corresponding flow vectors concentrate around the toe of the wall, from which relatively little heat transfer occurs compared with the wall faces. By comparison, for the tunnel case, the flow vectors concentrate at the invert and crown and therefore provide more advantageous heat transfer conditions. If the groundwater flow would run parallel to the length of the energy wall, then the dam effect would be reduced and the evaluation of the energy availability would differ, potentially offering higher heat transfer rates. Nonetheless the scenario analysed remains a suitable conservative case for first assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nPreliminary design charts\nBringing together all these results with a full factorial analysis of the cases\n44\n, design charts were developed. They are presented in Figs.\u00a08 and 9 for constant temperature and convective heat boundary condition on the excavation side, respectively. On the basis of the specific site conditions, i.e.\u00a0ground temperature, soil thermal conductivity and groundwater flow velocity, the charts give an indication of the heat that can be potentially extracted\/injected, expressed in watts per square meter of wall surface. They are obviously related to the specific geometry and assumptions of the presented model, but could be used as a preliminary assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1\nEffect of the excavation boundary condition\nTo better evaluate the importance of the selected boundary conditions on the excavation side, other design charts were plotted for the case of thermal conductivity equal to 2.26 \n\nW\n\u2215\nm\n\u2215\nK\n\n including in the same graph the results for the two boundary conditions (Fig.\u00a010). For the same initial soil temperature and underground water flow velocity, the constant temperature boundary condition always gives a higher heat exchange, but the increment with respect to the heat transfer boundary condition is not always the same. The percentage difference between the two conditions is defined as: \n\n(4)\n\n\nD\n=\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nT\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nQ\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n\u22c5\n100\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nQ\n\n\nT\n\n\n and \n\n\nQ\n\n\nH\n\n\n are the heat exchanged with constant temperature and heat transfer boundary conditions respectively. The difference is greatest for no groundwater flow and for lower absolute difference between the inlet temperature and the ground temperature. The smallest percentage difference is 2.5% with a temperature difference between the soil and the ground of 20\u00a0\u00b0C and underground water flow velocity of 2 m\/d, while the highest is 31.9% with a temperature difference between the soil and the ground of 4\u00a0\u00b0C and no underground water flow.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion and comparison with other energy geostructures\nThe preliminary design charts demonstrate that the two most important factors in assessing initial capacity are the absolute temperature difference between the circulating fluid and the ground, and the presence or absence of significant groundwater flow. For example the former can increase the heat exchange from 9 W\/m2 to 27 W\/m2 as the temperature differences increases from 4\u00a0\u00b0C to 20\u00a0\u00b0C (see Fig.\u00a04b) for the fixed temperature boundary condition. Similar results are observed for the convective case. The latter is seen to increase energy availability by between 150% and 200% depending on the case, and could be even more important in the case of flow parallel to the length of the structure. The ground thermal conductivity is also important when groundwater flow is absent, leading to a similar 150% increase in capacity over the range of parameters studied. While the nature of the internal boundary condition does impact the results obtained, this effect is typically smaller than the influence of the ground conditions.\nOverall the results of the analysis presented give an extreme range of heat transfer rates between 6 W\/m\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n and 32 W\/m2 in the absence of groundwater flow, increasing to 48 W\/m2 where that flow is significant. Therefore, overall a reasonable typical range of 15 to 25 W\/m2 could be inferred from the base case.\n\nIt has already been observed that these figures are in line with field data obtained for energy walls in other studies, especially when considering the duration of those trials and the absolute temperature difference. These figures can be further compared to field data from other energy geostructures. Three energy tunnel field trials of lengths of one month or more are summarised in Ref.\u00a043. The cases presented heat transfer rates in the range 3 W\/m2 to 34 W\/m2. This range is close to the extreme range of values determined in this study. It is a wider range than the field data for energy walls, perhaps relating to the larger number of cases. This is therefore consistent with the results of the numerical studies, providing very similar ranges of energy availability for tunnels and walls.\nFour long term studies of energy availability from energy piles are also included in Ref.\u00a043. Here the results are in the range from 21 W\/m2 to 46 W\/m2 and is noticeably higher than the data from walls and tunnels, especially at the lower bound. This increased capacity per foundation surface area will be related to the full embedment of energy piles, and the absence of the excavations side boundary condition which can effect the efficiency of energy wall and energy tunnel schemes.\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThis study has presented preliminary design charts for outline design of energy walls, focusing on the role of the initial ground conditions. The most important factors determining the energy availability from an embedded retaining wall used as a heat exchanger are:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe undisturbed ground temperature relative to the fluid circulation temperature in the wall. This absolute temperature difference can have a threefold impact on the energy exchanged under the conditions studied.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe groundwater flow velocity, which can increase the energy available by 150% or more compared with the case of no flow. However, the cases considered with groundwater flow perpendicular to the wall length showed the wall to act partially as a dam, restricting groundwater benefit compared to other energy geostructures. This effect would be less significant for water flow parallel to the tunnel length in which case the beneficial effect of groundwater flow would be higher.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe ground thermal conductivity, which in the absence of groundwater flow can also increase the energy availability by up to 150%.\n\n\n\nIt is also important to consider appropriate excavation side boundary conditions, as this study showed that choices made here can lead to differences in outcome of up to 32%. This means giving proper consideration to the use of the space made by the retaining structure, whether it is temperature controlled, or perhaps subject to air flow movements or other sources of heat.\nOverall, it can be shown that reasonable values for first assessment of energy wall capacity would be in the range 15\u201325\u00a0W\/m2. The presented design charts could then be used for a site specific first assessment, prior to carrying out a full design of the system.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAlice Di Donna: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing, Visualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition.

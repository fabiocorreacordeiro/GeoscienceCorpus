on the left-lateral Kunlun Pass-Jiangcuo fault (KPJF) located within the Bayan Har block, Tibetan Plateau, caused an \u223c165-km-long surface rupture and widespread ground deformation. This earthquake was well recorded by SAR images and our near-field GPS network during the coseismic and postseismic periods, providing a rare opportunity to shed light on the seismic and aseismic slip behaviors on the slow-slipping causative fault. Here, we constrain the coseismic slip distribution of the 2021 Maduo earthquake by the joint use of InSAR and near-field GPS observations. Then, time-dependent afterslip evolution is inverted from cGPS and InSAR time series in the first \u223c160\u00a0days after the mainshock. The results show that the mainshock involves five asperities with a maximum slip of 4.79\u00a0m, including an E-W trending main fault and a secondary fault locates on the eastern end of the main fault. The significant energy released near Changmahe Township could be partialy explained by the fact that the seismogenic fault here cut through the pre-existing NW-SE trending faults. Afterslip played a dominant role in the early postseismic deformation, which has released seismic moment equivalent to an Mw 6.78 earthquake, 10.3% of the coseismic moment. The seismic and aseismic slip distributions have complementary patterns in spatial, except for the overlaps on the Changmahe segment, suggesting the heterogeneity of frictional property on the fault plane. The rupture of the Maduo earthquake is located in the stress shadow induced by historical earthquakes, indicating the high accumulated stress on the KPJF. The stress level, as well as the potential seismic hazard on the \u223c300-km-long seismic gap between the 2001 Kokoxili earthquake and the 2021 Maduo earthquake, is further raised by the historical events.\n               ","1":"\n                  The morpho-tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau is controlled by complicated interactions between tectonic uplift and surface erosion. The Gangdese batholith in the southern Lhasa terrane is a key orogenic belt for exploring the complicated morpho-tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. In this contribution, we apply apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology to constrain the thermo-tectonic evolution of the central segment of the Gangdese batholith. Twenty-four granitoid samples were collected from both river valleys (e.g., the Yarlung and Xiang Rivers) and from the internal batholith areas located farther from river drainage (and\/or local faults) networks. All samples exhibit Miocene AFT ages between \u223c19.9 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a06.1\u00a0Ma. Inverse thermal history modeling results reveal that the central Gangdese batholith underwent a two-stage accelerated basement cooling in the Miocene. The first cooling stage took place during the late Oligocene to middle Miocene (\u223c25\u201315\u00a0Ma), this period of moderate to rapid basement cooling coincides with activity along the Gangdese thrust and Great Counter thrust system, and the Oligocene-Miocene delamination of the Lhasa lithosphere and concomitant asthenosphere upwelling. These tectonic processes acted as first-order control on regional basement uplift, denudation and exhumation. Second, a middle-late Miocene (\u223c14\u20135\u00a0Ma) rapid cooling is widely recognized in the whole Gangdese batholith. We suggest that this middle-late Miocene cooling is due to exhumation in response to tectonic and surface erosion processes such as N-S normal faults and enhanced river incision induced by the intensification of Asian monsoon. Finally, in combination with published low-temperature thermochronological and paleoaltimetry data, it is deduced that the present-day low-relief landscape of the southern Lhasa terrane resulted from a long-term balance between intense regional tectonic activity and surface erosion.\n               ","2":"\n                  In this study, we present a high-resolution, 3-D S wave velocity (Vs) model of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the Liaodong area at the northeast margin of the North China Craton (NCC). We build the model based on ambient noise tomography. Ambient noise data were obtained from both permanent stations and two new broad-band station profiles covering the Dandong-Tongliao (NCISP-10) and Baishan-Kuandian (NCISP-11) areas of the Liaodong-jilin region from October 2016 to December 2019. Our model reveals that different sides of the Tanlu Fault exhibited different Vs anomalies in both the upper crust and lithospheric upper mantle. Low Vs anomalies are observed in the west of the Tanlu Fault, which are interpreted to represent compositional variations at the crustal level. On the eastern side, low Vs anomalies are imaged which appear to represent \u201cheat\u201d or \u201chot material\u201d derived from the deep mantle. A high Vs anomaly imaged in the southwest of the Songliao basin spatially coincides with a geologic feature referred to as the southwest uplift, which divides the basin into two secondary depressions. The Vs anomaly is inferred to represent cold mafic magma produced by the subduction of the Pacific Plate during the Late Cretaceous. Upwelling of mantle materials provide the best explanation for a mass of hot lithosphere. They underplated at the base of the crust, which formed crustal reservoirs and was eventually emplaced as plutons or erupted as volcanic rocks observed around the study area.\n               ","3":"\n                  The Calabrian Arc subduction complex, in the northern Ionian Sea, is facing directly the westward subducting Apulian Swell, a sliver of continental crust covered by about 8\u00a0km of Mesozoic and Tertiary carbonates. Deformation patterns of this southernmost foreland segment of the Adria plate, analized from marine geological\/geophysical data include: 1) flexure\/bending, under the load of the advancing Calabrian Arc wedge; 2) buckling in response to compression of the surrounding orogens (southern Apennines, Dinarides-Hellenides); and 3) roll-back and eastward retreat of the slab. In this work, a reprocessed dataset of marine seismic reflection profiles is used to determine the interplay between these tectonic processes during progressive advancement of the Calabrian Arc wedge since Pliocene times. Our analysis indicates that the wedge is presently affected by compressive tectonics along several fore-thrusts, forming an imbricate fan system. Conversely, the Apulian Swell affected by inherited and rift-related Permo-Triassic normal faults, shows transpressive and positive tectonic inversions and, in its southern portion, the effects of the Hellenic fold\/thrust belt shortening. The interference between the Calabrian Arc and the Hellenic chain plays an important role in controlling the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the Apulian Swell, which underwent bending and roll-back during a pre-middle Pliocene stage followed by buckling processes. Active extension observed in the hinge zone of the Apulian Swell between Calabrian Arc and the Hellenides might suggest recent reactivation of flexure and retreat.\n               ","4":"\n                  The Xianshuihe fault on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is one of the most active intracontinental faults worldwide. At least 16 strong earthquakes (M\u00a0>\u00a06.5) have occurred on this fault since 1327\u00a0CE. To reasonably assess the future seismic hazard of this fault region, it is essential to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the fault kinematics and stress state. In this study, we developed a fine 3D geomechanical model of the Xianshuihe fault and its adjacent area, and obtained a spatially continuous contemporary kinematics and crustal background stress field of this region. Our modeled results show that the slip rate of the Xianshuihe fault is as high as 11\u00a0mm\/a on the northwestern segment and generally decreases to ~9\u00a0mm\/a on the southeastern segment (i.e. Moxi fault). The Yulongxi fault, a branch oblique to the Moxi fault, has different slip senses in different segments with a very low horizontal slip rate (<0.6\u00a0mm\/a). In terms of stress, the study area is dominated by a transtensional faulting stress regime with E-W-trending maximum horizontal stress SH, indicating the study area is mainly subjected to an E-W compression and N-S extension. Localized normal and thrust faulting regimes appear alternately along the Xianshuihe fault, showing an inhomogeneous stress state. The high normal stresses on the Songlinkou-Selaha segment and the Moxi fault combined with their relatively high slip rates, make us speculate that these two segments have the potential to produce strong earthquakes in the future. A relatively high seismic hazard is also ascribed to the Yulongxi fault based on the analysis of its geological and geodynamic environment.\n               ","5":"\n                  An M\n                     w 7.4 left-lateral earthquake hit Maduo County in Qinghai province, China, on 21 May 2021. In this paper, we combined the 1-Hz global navigation satellite system (GNSS) displacement waveforms, GNSS static offsets and the three-dimensional (3D) co-seismic deformation field from the interferometric synthetic radar (InSAR) measurements to estimate the source kinematics of this event. Our results reveal that there was about 160\u00a0km of surface ruptures with varying strike angles, and the earthquake propagated bilaterally, with the bulk of the slip formed to the southeast of the epicenter. Substantial slip occurred to a depth of ~6\u00a0km, and the estimated maximum slip was ~5\u00a0m. The source time function presents a\u00a0~\u00a035-s total duration with two peaks, and the total geodetic seismic moment is 1.61\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01020\u00a0Nm (equivalent to M\n                     w 7.4). The near-field high-rate GNSS waveforms inversion results indicate that this earthquake is an overall subshear but locally supershear rupture event. The preferred average rupture velocity is 2.8\u00a0km\/s while the velocities to the southeast and northwest of epicenter are 3.8 and 2.2\u00a0km\/s, respectively. Supershear enhanced ground motion and simulation using the 3D curvilinear grid finite-difference method shows the acceleration caused by the earthquake exceeded the building code limits for bridges that collapsed due to strong ground shaking. Furthermore, this earthquake increased the stress level of the Maqin\u2013Maqu segment of the East Kunlun Fault, and was also responsible for an off-fault aftershock sequence at the northwest end of the earthquake rupture.\n               ","6":"\n                  Knowledge regarding the origin of the arcuate belts located south of the Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) is important for understanding the evolution of the ATF. Here, we conduct a detailed paleomagnetic rotation study on two halves of the Saishitengshan arcuate belt (SAB) in the northern Qaidam Basin to better understand the ATF evolution. Paleomagnetic results reveal an ~25\u00b0 rotational difference between the two halves during deposition of the Shangganchaigou and Xiayoushashan formations. This rotational difference is consistent with the geometric trend change in the SAB, and its oroclinal bending is further constrained as having occurred during the middle to late Miocene (~17\u201310\u00a0Ma) based on similar rotation of nearby Heishiqiu. Combined with other paleomagnetic results along the ATF, we propose that a transitional zone with remarkable counterclockwise rotations\u00a0developed south of the fault due to the frictional dragging of the ATF, which is related to its tectonic transition from concentrated to distributed sinistral shear during the middle to late Miocene.\n               ","7":"\n                  The 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo earthquake ruptured the Jiangcuo fault, a secondary fault within the Bayan Har block, NE Tibetan Plateau, which attests that large earthquakes can occur on faults with very low slip rates. In this study, we use data from local seismic stations to explore the 3D velocity structure beneath the source region of the Maduo earthquake. Our results indicate that there is a distinct low-velocity anomaly in the mid-lower crust, and the thickness of this low-velocity zone decreases sharply to the east. The Maduo earthquake occurred in the transition zone between the high- and low-velocity regions. Based on our local velocity model and our knowledge of the regional crustal structures, we constructed numerical models to investigate the stress and strain energy distributions in our study area. As indicated by the stress concentration, strain energy accumulation, and low strain rate in the shallow upper crust around the source region, we conclude that the seismic velocity heterogeneity and the weak ductile mid-lower crust provide a unique tectonic environment that facilitated the nucleation of the Maduo earthquake. This study helps to understand the mechanisms of the Maduo earthquake, and more importantly reconciles the seeming contradiction between large earthquakes and low slip and strain rates.\n               ","8":"\n                  We investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of strain accommodation during multiphase rift evolution in the Shire Rift Zone (SRZ), East Africa. The NW-trending SRZ records a transition from magma-rich rifting phases (Permian-Early Jurassic: Rift-Phase 1 (RP1), and Late Jurassic-Cretaceous: Rift-Phase 2 (RP2)) to a magma-poor phase in the Cenozoic (ongoing: Rift-Phase 3 (RP3)). Our observations show that although the rift border faults largely mimic the pre-rift basement metamorphic fabrics, the rift termination zones occur near crustal-scale rift-orthogonal basement shear zones (Sanangoe (SSZ) and the Lurio shear zones) during RP1-RP2 period. In RP3, the RP1-RP2 sub-basins were largely abandoned, and the rift axes migrated northeastward (rift-orthogonally) into the RP1-RP2 basin margin, and northwestward (strike-parallel) ahead of the RP2 rift-tip. The northwestern RP3 rift-axis side-steps across the SSZ with a rotation of border faults across the shear zone, and terminates farther northwest at another regional-scale shear zone. We suggest that over the multiple pulses of tectonic extension and strain migration in the SRZ, pre-rift basement fabrics acted as: 1) favorably-oriented zones of mechanical strength contrast that localized the large rift faults, and 2) mechanical \u2018barriers\u2019 that refracted and possibly, temporarily halted the lateral propagation of the rift zone. Further, the cooled RP1-RP2 mafic dikes localized later-phase deformation in the form of border fault hard-linking transverse faults that exploited strength contrasts within the dike clusters and served as mechanically-strong zones that arrested some of the RP3 fault-tips. Overall, we argue that during pulsed rift propagation, inherited crustal strength anisotropies may serve as both strain-localizing, refracting, and \u2018strain barrier\u2019 tectonic structures.\n               ","9":"\n                  The slip rates on the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault system (XXFS) are crucial for understanding the strain partitioning and evaluating its seismic risk. Here, we establish a 3D viscoelastic FEM model incorporating the faults as contact discontinuities to gain a numerical image of the XXFS's continuous slip rate. The viscosity of Southeastern Tibet and the locking depth of the XXFS were investigated and constrained by interseismic GPS observations. We estimated that the viscosities of the lower crust and the mantle lithosphere of southeastern Tibet were 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01018 and 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01019\u00a0Pa\u00a0s, respectively. The interaction between the Daliangshan fault and the Anninghe-Zemuhe fault governs slip partitioning around the middle part of the XXFS. The XXFS\u2019 overall mechanical efficiency is improved by the initiation and development of the Daliangshan fault. The interseismic strain buildup rate appears to be spatially heterogeneous, depending on the changes in slip rate along the strike of the XXFS.

To explore the relationship between fault interaction and earthquake migration in this target area, we simulated the Coulomb stress change (\u0394CFS) caused by 13 historical large earthquakes (M\u00a0\u2265\u00a06.0) since 1968. We show that the 1968 earthquake (Mw 7.2) on the Palu-Koro Fault promoted the 1996 earthquake sequence (Mw 7.9, Mw 6.6, and Mw 7.0) on the Minahassa Megathrust by transferring positive stress to its western edge with a maximum \u0394CFS value of 124\u00a0kPa before 1996. Consequently, the 1996 earthquake (Mw 7.9) promoted six large earthquakes (M\u00a0\u2265\u00a06.0) including the 2018 Palu earthquake (Mw 7.5) on the Palu-Koro Fault between 1998 and 2020 via stress loading over the entire Palu-Koro Fault with a maximum \u0394CFS value of 76\u00a0kPa. Via a positive feedback, these six earthquakes have increased stress at the western edge of the Minahassa Megathrust with a maximum \u0394CFS value of 265\u00a0kPa up to 2020, resulting in increased seismic and consequent tsunami hazards in this region. Based on these risks, close attention should be paid to the future seismic hazards in Central Sulawesi. These findings suggest that the Palu-Koro Fault and the Minahassa Megathrust constitute a coupled fault system in which seismicity in either fault might bring the other closer to failure. Our results provide new insights into the causes of earthquake generation, migration, and hazard estimation in Central Sulawesi, and provide a basis for understanding stress transfer and seismic activity in strike-slip and thrust fault systems globally.\n               ","11":"\n                  The interactions between arc-continent collision and subduction zones are still poorly understood. Here, we use 2D seismic data to document upper plate deformational features and identify different structural styles along the New Guinea Trench, western Pacific, and discuss their broader significance. In the western section, normal faults and negative flower structures occur within the strata of the upper plate. An unconformity represents the signal of tectonically driven subsidence. In the eastern section, both thick-skinned and thin-skinned thrusting are found within the frontal upper plate. In the central section, rare extensional or shortening deformation is identified within the forearc basement and overlying strata. Horizontal, thick sedimentary sequences within the Caroline subbasin have been subducted beneath the upper plate. This suggests that Miocene subduction in the eastern section led to the formation of a thrust-deformed ophiolitic basement in the upper plate. Since the Miocene, strike-slip tectonic processes dominated in the upper plate, causing compressional deformation in the strata in the eastern section and extensional to transtensional deformation in the strata in the western section. The strike-slip tectonic processes might have been weakened in the upper plate in central section due to the incoming Eauripik Rise. Over geologic time, arc-continent collision processes and related changing of regional tectonic forces can have a long-lived influence on shaping and deforming subduction systems.\n               ","12":"\n                  The Dianzhong Block (DZB) located on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is an important tectonic zone characterized by the intense flow of crustal material. Although it is widely accepted that materials originating from the Tibetan Plateau migrate southeastward in the DZB and its vicinity, the flow mechanism and subsurface structures remain controversial. Here, we image the subsurface velocity and azimuthal anisotropy structures beneath the DZB and its surroundings by using eikonal equation-based tomography to study the crustal flow and deformation mechanisms. In this study, we collect high-quality seismic data from 290 broadband seismic stations and manually pick a total of 31,981 first arrivals. Our tomographic results display prominent velocity anomalies and complex azimuthal anisotropy patterns. In the upper crust, our results reveal predominant high-velocity anomalies, which are related to the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP) and the stable Simao Block. We find strong low-velocity anomalies beneath the DZB in the middle\u2013lower crust. The low-velocity anomalies extend southward from the Xiaojinhe Fault (XJHF) to the Red River Fault (RRF) and then rotate southeastward to the east of the Xiaojiang Fault (XJF). In addition, the inverted fast velocity directions generally follow the strike of the low-velocity anomalies. Based on these findings, we consider the existence of middle\u2013lower crustal flow inside the DZB. Three distinct features of azimuthal anisotropy in the middle-upper crust are found around the XJF reflecting complex deformation, which may indicate different factors controlling the deformation of the XJF from the north to the south. In the lower crust and uppermost mantle, the azimuthal anisotropy beneath the RRF is relatively complex, exhibiting two patterns: one perpendicular and another parallel to the fault.\n               ","13":"\n                  Normal faulting in orogens is usually associated with gravitational potential energy (GPE) due to elevation differences and contrasting material rheology between mountains and foreland areas. The 2008\u20132020 Yutian normal earthquake sequence in the West Kunlun Mountains has been closely studied over the last decade, but the mechanisms of normal faulting in the region are still an open question as both gravitational force and releasing step-overs have been proposed to explain the extension in West Kunlun. We investigated the normal faulting mechanism through (1) co- and postseismic kinematic models constrained by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and (2) analytical force balance modeling with a thin viscous approximation. We used the InSAR time series technique to map the postseismic deformation within 3\u00a0years following the 2008 Yutian earthquake. The InSAR-derived afterslip model revealed a clear slip polarity transition from strike-slip to normal faulting, suggesting a tight connection between the normal faulting and bounding strike-slip faults. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-constrained thin viscous sheet model gave an estimate of ~1022\u00a0Pa\u2219s for the effective viscosity of the West Kunlun lithosphere, which is generally in line with previous estimates that used a similar methodology. The stress field predicted by the thin viscous model primarily features north\u2013south compression rather than east\u2013west extension, suggesting that normal faulting is caused not by the GPE contrast across the margin of West Kunlun, but instead by the releasing step-overs bounded by strike-slip faults. The main contribution of this paper is therefore identifying the primary causes of normal faulting in West Kunlun and improving our understanding of the active tectonics of the NW Tibetan Plateau.\n               ","14":"\n                  The Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), the most prominent tectonic boundary between the subducting Indian crust and the overthrusting Himalaya, occurs as a key structure dominating the active tectonics of the Himalaya. Previous studies indicate that the MHT forms a major buried ramp in the mid-crust, which with varying geometry and kinematics leads to a distinctive pattern of uplift along the Himalaya. However, it is unknown if and how these along-strike variations are correlated with the well-known active N-S-trending normal faults across the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we report 39 new apatite and zircon fission track ages in the Cona area (~92\u00b0E) in the eastern Himalaya, coinciding with the easternmost N-S-trending extensional system in southern Tibet, the Cona Cross Structure (CCS). Spatial patterns of surface cooling ages are consistent with an overthrusting of the Himalayan wedge above a mid-crustal ramp in the MHT. Thermokinematic inverse modeling yields contrasting geometries and kinematics for the mid-crustal ramp on both sides of the CCS. Specifically, to the west of the CCS, the MHT developed a major ramp (with a dip angle of 20.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00b0) spanning 50\u201370\u00a0km, which initiated at ~11.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0Ma. To the east, thermokinematic inversion suggests a much less developed ramp spanning only ~10\u201315\u00a0km, initiated at ~6.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma. These results imply an ~14-km deeper depth of the MHT to the west of the CCS than to the east. Our modeling also suggests distinctive and evolving ramp-thrusting rates for the MHT on both sides of the CCS. This suggests an independent deformation accommodation by the MHT ramp thrusting in segments divided by the CCS along strike.

The CCAs consist of a central clast (mostly quartz fragments with subordinate clay aggregates) and a concentric rim of nano-clay particles (i.e., cortex). The CCAs range in size from 1 to 100\u00a0\u03bcm and developed adjacent to a foliated high-strain layer at all slip rates. The microstructures suggest that the CCA-rich layer was mainly deformed by granular flow, whereas the foliated high-strain layer was deformed by cataclastic flow. The increase in average size of the CCAs with displacement and the formation of their concentric rims suggest that the CCAs grew like a rolling snowball. The estimated strain rates obtained from the concentric layers of the CCAs and strain markers indicate the existence of a range of shear strain rates that favors granular flow and the formation and growth of CCAs.\n               ","16":"\n                  Low Strain Rate regions (LSRrs), i.e., areas undergoing tectonic deformation at rates of 1\u00a0mm\/yr or less, often host important cities and highly vulnerable anthropogenic assets, and due to their subdued topography and relatively infrequent seismicity, are often considered low seismic hazard areas. Despite this, infrequent but high-magnitude earthquakes in such regions suggest that identifying active structures in the LSRr is one of the primary challenges for both the scientific community and modern societies. In such regions, one of the main issues in identifying active faults is the lack of valuable outcrop data due to erosional\/sedimentation rates overwhelming the fault deformation, causing the hidden morphological signature of the tectonic structures.\n                  This work proposes a multidisciplinary approach designed to detect active geological structures and their related deformation in such areas. Our approach consists of quantitative morphotectonic, offshore and onshore tectonostratigraphic and GNSS joint analyses. To test this approach, we selected as a natural laboratory the partially offshore northern Sicilian LSRr (southern Italy) in the coastal sector located between the two major cities of Palermo and Termini Imerese. This area includes the compressional structures of the northern sector of the Apennine-Maghrebian fold and thrust belt, presently accommodating the slow Africa-Europe plate convergence.\n                  The main results we achieved are 1) new evidence of active tectonic deformation in this region; 2) the 3D modelling of two NNW-trending active faults; 3) the slip rate of a segment of the westernmost of the two detected faults; 4) a newly recorded relative GNSS velocity field; 5) a new morphotectonic map and morphotectonic evolution model of the study area.

We adopt back projection (BP) and multi-point source (MPS) techniques to determine the rupture directivity and focal mechanism change of this event. Both methods reveal a unilateral rupture propagation to the west of the epicenter, and also resolve a changed focal mechanism. We use a two-segment-faults geometry to parameterize the fault model with strikes at 283\u00b0 for the east segment and 250\u00b0 for the west respectively, and conduct a finite fault inversion (FFI) combining seismic and geodetic observations. The kinematics results indicate the whole rupture process lasts about 25\u00a0s, yielding a total seismic moment of 3.16\u00d71019\u00a0Nm (Mw = 6.9) with a peak moment rate reaching 3.1\u00d71018\u00a0Nm\/s around 10\u00a0s. The rupture is composed of two asperities separated by the junction of two fault planes. The main slip area, with maximum amplitude reaching three meters, distributes at a shallow depth and displays a complementary pattern with aftershocks. The slip in the first six seconds is dominated by a pure normal faulting mechanism, while the following rupture includes an additional strike-slip component. The change of focal mechanism reflects the tectonic transition from dilatation to lateral shearing, which is also evident in the aftershock mechanisms. The synthetic tsunami waves also well fit three tidal gauge observations. The coseismic Coulomb stress is calculated to analyze the relationship between the mainshock and aftershock evolution.

The Duhok fold belt is a frontal zone of the north-western part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt in the Kurdistan region near the north-eastern margin of the Arabian Plate. It is characterized by WNW-ESE striking, doubly-plunging, upright symmetric to asymmetric detachment folds that involve ~8.2\u201310.9\u00a0km of Paleozoic to Quaternary strata. These folds vary from 5 to 75\u00a0km long, 4\u201320\u00a0km wide and have a surface relief (caused by basement uplift) up to 3.2\u00a0km. Five regional and twelve local structural cross-sections were constructed parallel to the regional SSW tectonic transport and perpendicular to the fold axial trends. Section lengths vary between 4.94\u00a0km and 101.55\u00a0km. Two main detachment levels have been inferred for the Duhok fold belt. A deep basal detachment was placed at the base of the Paleozoic successions within the Ordovician shales of the Khabour Formation at depths from 8\u00a0km to 10\u00a0km. Shallower, intermediate detachment levels occur within the shales and evaporites of the Mid-Upper Permian and Upper Jurassic strata at depths 1.7\u00a0km in the frontal sectors to around 5.5\u00a0km in the hinterland. The thickness of the Paleozoic succession in the Duhok fold belt is ~2\u00a0km. Deformation by thin-skinned detachment folding together with thick-skinned thrusting is inferred to have occurred in the Duhok region from the Mid Miocene through to the Present-Day. The maximum NNE-SSW-directed shortening produced by detachment folding was about 18.62\u00a0km (19.71%) over a section length of 94.45\u00a0km.

This unified, continuum-based model, incorporates a staggered finite difference\u2013marker-in-cell method and accounts for inertial wave-mediated dynamics and fluid flow in poro-visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. Global Picard-iterations and an adaptive time stepping allow the correct resolution of both long- and short-time scales, ranging from years to milliseconds. We present a comprehensive in-plane strike-slip setup in which we test analytical poroelastic benchmarks of pore-fluid pressure diffusion from an injection point along a finite fault width. We then investigate how pore-fluid pressure evolution and solid\u2013fluid compressibility control sequences of seismic and aseismic fault slip. While the weakening phase is controlled by localized compaction of pores and dynamic self-pressurization of fluids inside the undrained fault zone, the subsequent propagation of dynamic ruptures is driven by pore-pressure waves. Furthermore, pore-fluid pressure conditions on the fault and shear strength weakening associated with rapid self-pressurization of fluids control the characteristic slip-weakening distance, the final size of seismic events, and the scaling between slip and fracture energy observed for large earthquakes. Our modeling results demonstrate that fault failure can occur due to poroelastic coupling on a finite-width shear zone, thus highlighting the importance of considering the realistic hydro-mechanical structure of faults to investigate fluid-driven seismic and aseismic slip, either as a natural process or induced by human activities.\n               ","20":"\n                  Earthquakes on faults in the brittle upper crust evoke sudden changes in pore fluid pressure as well as postseismic viscoelastic flow in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle but the relative importance of these processes during the postseismic phase has not been systematically studied. Here, we use two-dimensional finite-element models to investigate how pore fluid pressure changes and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation interact during the earthquake cycle of an intracontinental dip-slip fault. To isolate the effects from pore fluid flow and viscoelastic relaxation from each other, we performed experiments with and without pore fluid flow and viscoelastic relaxation, respectively. In different experiments, we further varied the permeability of the crust and the viscosity of lower crust or lithospheric mantle. Our model results show poroelastic effects dominate the velocity field in the first months after the earthquake. In models considering poroelastic effects, the surfaces of both hanging wall and footwall of the normal fault subside at different velocities, while they move upwards in the thrust fault model. Depending on the permeability and viscosity values, viscoelastic relaxation dominates the velocity field from about the second postseismic year onward although poroelastic effects may still occur if the permeability of the upper crust is sufficiently low. With respect to the spatial scales of poroelastic effects and viscoelastic relaxation, our results show that pore fluid pressure changes affect the velocity field mostly within 10\u201320\u00a0km around the fault, whereas the signal from viscoelastic relaxation is recognizable up to several tens of kilometres away from the fault.

The aim of the study has been to investigate stress regime and evaluates the role played by the Usangu basin in accommodating the relative movement between the two sub-basins of the Rukwa rift and the Malawi rift. Results show that most of the seismicity (~70%) concentrates along the Usangu border fault. A lesser amount of seismicity (~30%) is found within the basin and in the southwestern end of the basin towards the RVP. These findings suggest that the Usangu border fault, intrabasinal and transfer faults within the basin are associated with the seismic activities. This implies ongoing active deformation within the basin, which is accommodated by slip on the Usangu border fault system and seismicity associated with intrabasinal faults could indicate the temporal strain migration from the border fault. Although it has previously been suggested that the Eastern branch propagates southeasterly towards the coast, however, given the dense and long deployment of seismic station within the study area the possibility of second propagation of the Eastern branch towards the RVP in the Western branch cannot be ruled out. The seismicity therefore indicates that the Western branch could likely link with the Eastern branch via a wide zone of deformation combining the Mamizi-Kilombero-Ruhuhu fault zone and the zone of Mtera-Ruaha-Usangu rift graben, Focal mechanisms along the Usangu border fault and transfer faults within the basin show a combination of normal faulting and strike slip motion indicating extension with sinistral and dextral components of motion, consistent with palaeostress data and the strike slip deformation within the basin through accommodating the relative movement between the southern-most sub-basin of the Rukwa rift and northern-most sub-basin of the Malawi rift.\n               ","22":"\n                  A rift basin developed in the Neoproterozoic Tarim Craton and it provides a key perspective for understanding the breakup of Rodinia.

Dynamic rupture on a vertical strike-slip fault is modeled with undrained inelastic off-fault response incorporated by the Drucker-Prager yield criterion. I show that in a local transpressive stress regime dynamic off-fault failure at restraining bends produces significantly larger and more localized surface uplift than is produced by purely elastic dislocation models, resulting in a positive flower and coseismic pop-up structure. The larger uplift is due to frictional sliding with a thrust component on conjugate microfractures, modeled by inelastic deformation. The short-wavelength inelastic uplift, largely controlled by bend size, is shown to generate localized tsunami efficiently in a shallow bay by fully coupling dynamic rupture, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunami. Fully-coupled models also indicate that supershear rupture on a vertical planar strike-slip fault does not generate large tsunami as the large kinetic energy of supershear rupture is carried away by ocean acoustic waves.

Thermal modeling of the thermochronology data revealed two episodes of accelerated cooling events at ~110\u201385\u00a0Ma and ~40\u201325\u00a0Ma. The late Early Cretaceous initiation of an accelerated cooling event at rates of ~6\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma was considered to be the cause of the formation of the basin-and-range system in a back-arc extensional setting related to the rollback of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. The second cooling event at ~40\u201325\u00a0Ma at a rate of ~20\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma, reflected by the youngest apatite fission track ages (~25\u201320\u00a0Ma), was likely ascribed to headwater erosion along the drainage divide related to the intensification of the East Asian Monsoon and extensional tectonism. The sharp discrepancy in apatite fission track ages across the Zhenghe-Dapu Fault zone implies that the collapse of the late Mesozoic coastal magmatic arc in the early Eocene (51.4\u201345.6\u00a0Ma). This is attributed to the northward propagation of extension related to the rollback of the Paleo-Pacific Plate that formed the eastward-dipping topography. Furthermore, the long-lasting extension due to the rollback of the Pacific Plate since the ridge subduction of the Izanagi-Pacific at ~50\u00a0Ma likely drove the exhumation of the Cathaysia Block and opening of the South China Sea.\n               ","25":"\n                  To investigate the mechanism of tectonic tremor and the factors that influence its occurrence and fluctuations, we use seismic reflection data to map in detail a shear zone associated with the plate boundary fault in the Nankai accretionary prism, southwest Japan. The shear zone can be identified from its low seismic velocity and low reflection amplitude, which may signify the presence of high pore pressure, around the transition boundary from frontal outer wedge to inner wedge. A detailed comparison of the mapped shear zone and the distribution of tectonic tremor demonstrate that tremor tended to occur in the thick part of the shear zone, where high pore fluid pressure may weaken faults and thereby facilitate slow earthquakes. Furthermore tremors align on the oblique strike-slip faults that caused variation of the shear zone thickness as well as fluctuation of stress and pore pressure. The oblique strike-slip faults that control the thickness of the shear zone and tremor distributions are interpreted as features formed by the collision of an accretionary prism against a landward tectonic backstop.\n               ","26":"\n                  The structure of the southeastern Gulf of California rifted margin is only partly known because of the thick sedimentary cover of the continental shelf and coastal areas of Sinaloa and Nayarit. Here we report the subsurface structure and probable age of the Mazatl\u00e1n basin, one of the largest buried basins, based on interpretation of reprocessed by multichannel 2D reflection seismic profiles and an exploratory well drilled by Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) between 1979 and 1980, as well as gravimetric data. The Mazatl\u00e1n basin is located just north of the active subduction zone of the Rivera plate and west of the new oceanic crust accreted since the Pliocene at the mouth of the Gulf. The basin is bounded to the west by a high of the Late Cretaceous batholiths exposed in the Tres Marias Islands and in the normal faults bounding the Nayarit Troughs, and to the east by the late Oligocene-early Miocene extensional faults bounding the Sierra Madre Occidental. Based on the characteristics of the seismic profiles, the basin can be divided into three main sectors. The transition between the northern and central sectors is defined by an abrupt deepening of the basement that corresponds to the westward prolongation of ENE-WSW trending accommodation zones separating opposite tilted domains in the Sierra Madre Occidental. The acoustic basement is clearly defined in the central sector by a set of high-amplitude reflectors suggesting an igneous origin. The deepest part of the basin is located toward the coastal plain of Nayarit and coincides with a gravimetric minimum. We identify several high amplitude reflectors interpreted as mafic sills, which become more abundant toward the south. At least part of them can be correlated with the widespread mafic volcanism emplaced at 9\u201312\u00a0Ma along the eastern margin of the Gulf of California rift. In the northern and central sectors we identified three main stratigraphic boundaries (L1, L2, and L3) within the basin filling, which define seismo-stratigraphic sequences. The shallower sequences, limited by the L1 and L2 boundaries and attributed to the Pleistocene and part of the Pliocene, lack evidence of significant deformation. The sequence above L3 boundary, can be assigned to the earliest Pliocene and the Miocene since they are intruded by a\u00a0~\u00a010\u00a0Ma basaltic sill cut by the Huichol-1 exploratory well. The lower part of the basin is characterized by high amplitude reflectors that pinches out against the acoustic basement and correspond to volcanic tuffs and sedimentary deposits correlative with the lower member of the Comond\u00fa group exposed in Baja California, which includes ~23 to ~19\u00a0Ma distal part of ignimbrites sourced from the Sierra Madre Occidental in Nayarit. Faults with the most significant displacements have a listric geometry and dip from the E to NE. The maximum sediment thickness reported in the Huichol-1 well is 2800\u00a0m, with a two-way travel time of 2.7\u00a0s, but it reaches 3.7 TWTT in some areas. Based on sedimentation rates, the minimum age for the onset of sedimentation in the basin is ~19\u00a0Ma, which is consistent with the regional tectonic evolution of the margin.\n               ","27":"\n                  The Cretaceous extensional province of the South China Block (SCB), and the decratonization-induced extension in the North China Block (NCB), were both controlled by the Late Mesozoic subduction of the Izanagi\/Paleo-Pacific Plate. Different from the metamorphic core complexes exhuming deep crustal rocks of the NCB, extension of the SCB is expressed by numerous half-graben basins and detachment of upper-middle crustal rocks, but its mode and mechanism remain unclarified. At the westernmost of this extensional province, the Early Paleozoic Yuechengling-Miao'ershan Massif, composed of the ductilely deformed Yuechengling pluton and undeformed Miao'ershan pluton, records Late Mesozoic detachment and exhumation. Magnetic fabrics of the western Yuechengling pluton are consistent with structural fabrics, while the NE-SW trending magnetic lineation and NE-SW striking magnetic foliation of the Miao'ershan pluton and the undeformed Yuechengling pluton reflect a pre-existing magma flow structure. Integrating our structural observation, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) results with gravity modeling, we reveal the deep geometry of the extensional dome and restore the original structure before the Late Mesozoic Ziyuan detachment. The mode of extension argues for a single batholith split into two separate massifs, thinning the crust of the central SCB. The shallow-dipping Ziyuan detachment fault (10\u00b0-30\u00b0) may account for the large horizontal extension but low exhumation of mid-crustal rocks in the SCB, in contrast to the large exhumation of deep crustal rocks in the NCB.\n               ","28":"\n                  While the cyclic nature of tectonic strain build-up and release is at least conceptually well understood (known as the earthquake cycle), it is not clear how variable the corresponding earthquake sizes and the time intervals between them are. Additional observations from past earthquakes are required to better constrain these aspects.\n                  In this context, we investigate the roughness of bedrock normal fault scarps along the Mt. Vettore fault and Roccapreturo fault (Italy), motivated by field observations that roughness positively correlates with profile height: higher sections of the fault surface are rougher than lower sections, ostensibly because the scarps were created by consecutive exposure events (e.g., earthquakes), exposing the higher sections for longer periods of time to subaerial weathering processes. Using high-resolution topographic models of the two fault surfaces, we calculate local roughness metrics and determine how they change as a function of profile height. In doing so, we are able to identify step-like changes in fault roughness, suggesting that the studied portions of the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo fault scarps were formed respectively by at least 6 and 4 large earthquakes, with slip increments ranging from 0.2\u00a0m to 1.7\u00a0m and corresponding magnitudes ranging from M6.1 to M6.8. Comparing our results for the Roccapreturo scarp with a previous cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) investigation at this site indicates that we were able to a) find previously identified earthquakes and b) find additional, previously unresolved ones. It appears that, during the same time interval, fault plane roughness analysis may be a more sensitive indicator of past earthquake activity on carbonate scarps than cosmogenic dating.\n               ","29":"\n                  Magnetic mineral assemblages record physical and chemical changes that occur during and after seismic events with large slips. For example, previous studies have reported that siderite, a common phase in carbonate rocks and a cement in noncarbonate rocks, breaks down to neoformed magnetite due to seismic friction or fluid related to earthquakes and high-velocity activities. Seismic magnetic mineral transformation of siderite to hematite, while also possible, is less common. Here, we present new rock magnetism and X-ray diffraction data to assess the magnetic mineral assemblage and mineral reactions along the East Yibug Chaka Fault, Tibetan Plateau. These data from well-exposed outcrops document the presence of siderite, magnetite and hematite. We show that abundant magnetite is neoformed during historic seismic fluid processes due to the breakdown of siderite at ~300\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C and that hematite forms from magnetite and siderite through subsequent interaction with interseismic fluids and\/or Earth surface weathering.\n               ","30":"\n                  The Paleo-Asian Ocean eventually closed along the Solonker Suture Zone during the Late Permian and Early Triassic, before the collision between the Siberian Craton and the North China Craton (NCC) formed the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). In this paper, Magnetotelluric (MT) profile data across the south-eastern CAOB and the northern margin of the NCC are explored to image the two-dimensional resistivity structure of the region. According to the resistivity model, a north-dipping conductive layer to the north of the Xilinhot fault and a south-dipping conductive layer to the south of the Linxi fault are revealed. The two conductors are interpreted as evidence of the late-stage low-angle bidirectional subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, which constrains the northern and southern deep boundaries of the Solonker Suture Zone. Another couple of mantle conductors with opposite dipping angles are revealed under the Solonker Suture Zone and Bainaimiao Belt, which are interpreted as evidence of the early-stage high-angle bidirectional subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Compared with the results from previously reported MT profiles in this area, the subduction angle becomes more gentle from west to east. The difference of convergence rate between the NCC and the Siberian Craton is considered to be the major cause of the closure difference along the strike. The northern margin of the NCC has a conductive lower crust, which may result from the magma underplating or crust-mantle decoupling, as it is imaged to be connected with the south-dipping conductive layer beneath the Solonker Suture Zone.\n               ","31":"\n                  We present the source mechanisms and rupture processes for the damaging 23 February 2020 earthquake doublet of Mw 5.8 and Mw 5.9 that occurred near the Turkish-Iranian border regions of Qotur-Goharan-Mir'Omar-Ravian (NW Iran), extending towards Saray and Ba\u015fkale (Eastern Turkey), as obtained from seismological waveform analysis and space geodesy imaging. Seismotectonic characteristics of the sequence highlight the role of indentation tectonics developed within regional-scale compressional environment where the Arabian microplate collides with the Eurasian plate. Here we report optimal finite-fault slip distribution patterns of the 2020 Qotur-Ravian earthquake doublet revealing complex co-seismic rupture propagation along the fault planes with maximum displacements ranging from 20 to 50\u00a0cm, stretching from the hypocentre to the surface. Analysis of aftershocks based on 3.5\u00a0months-long seismicity confirms distributed deformation. This energetic earthquake sequence demonstrates the distinct rupture characteristics illuminating differences in seismogenic properties and seismic hazard. Coulomb stress transfer modelling predicts triggering of the second event of Mw 5.9 by the first event of Mw 5.8. The zone of Coulomb stress changes attributed to varying pore pressure linking to geothermal water resources in the region as a driving force, may have an impact on the nucleation of triggered faulting. Evaluation of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data reveals the activated faults with evident co-seismic slip. Specifically, (1) we detected a rare case in earthquake-induced ground deformation where there is overlapping surface deformation due to sequential shallow events located closely in the crust, (2) the initial event ruptured a normal fault located towards W-NW of the latter inferred strike-slip fault and (3) the conjugate system of faults is closely placed at a few km apart. The frequent Sentinel-1 interferograms enhanced our imaging abilities of geometry and kinematics of shallow moderate-size M\u00a0<\u00a06.0 earthquakes and to trace seismogenic structures in remote and mountainous earthquake prone regions.\n               ","32":"\n                  During subshear earthquake rupture opposing sides of the fault experience transient impulses of tensile and compressive peak mean normal stresses exceeding the strength of the rock resulting in off-fault damage. This damage is expected to be influenced by lithology and occur preferably on the nominally tensile side of ruptures because rocks are weaker in tension than compression. Whereas the static tensile strength of many rocks is known, our capacity to relate parameters used to quantify brittle deformation in fault damage zones commonly measured in the field, including fracture density and fragment size, to earthquake rupture conditions is poor. This is due to a lack of experimental data relating tensile strength, fracture density, and fragment size to lithology under transient loading conditions. To relate brittle damage to coseismic tensile loading conditions, we use a modified sample configuration for a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) designed to induce tensile rock fragmentation. Experiments cover a range of rock types including granite, diabase, welded tuff, and sandstone. All crystalline rocks fail predominantly via mode-I fracture, while sandstone fails through localized dilation bands, distributed pore space expansion, and less common mode-I fractures. Measurements of fracture density, fragment size, and porosity change are compared to tensile strength and strain rate at failure. We derive empirical relationships for (1) the transition from fracture to dilation banding as a function of initial porosity and (2) the strain rate dependence of tensile strength. These empirical relationships are used to estimate the rock strength during earthquake rupture on the side of the fault loaded under tension for comparison to predicted stress decay with distance from a fault to estimate the lithology dependent extent and nature of coseismic fault damage. Our experiments offer new insights into the lithological controls on the formation of asymmetric fault damage zones by dynamic rupture.\n               ","33":"\n                  Understanding the tectonic history of the Qilian Shan provides significant insights into the growth pattern of the northern Tibetan Plateau. Due to the limitation of methodology and lack of detailed geological information over remote mountain ranges, there has been less information on the Pleistocene evolution of the southern Qilian Shan. Existing models for the Qilian Shan growth also fail to specify whether the southern Qilian Shan grew northward or southward during the late Cenozoic. Here we present provenance data on fieldwork paleocurrents, petrography, heavy mineral analysis, and zircon UPb ages from the Danghe valley between Danghe Nanshan and Yema Nanshan, southern Qilian Shan. Results show a \u2018seesaw-like\u2019 change of provenance from Yema Nanshan to the north during the early Pleistocene to Danghe Nanshan to the south, which suggests the northward thrusting of Danghe Nanshan. Integrated with previous studies, our inference of a Quaternary rapid exhumation of the southern Qilian Shan reinforces the argument of northward propagation of the southern Qilian Shan during the Pleistocene and suggests a complex growth pattern of the Qilian Shan, northeastern Tibetan Plateau.\n               ","34":"\n                  The Kachchh paleo-rift basin of western India which recently experienced Mw 7.6, 26th January 2001 Bhuj earthquake, is one of the most active and vulnerable intra-cratonic zones in the world categorized as seismic zone V, i.e. having potential to produce earthquakes of intensity IX or higher. We analysed the geodetic and seismic principal strain rates to reveal the seismic hazard potential of the Kachchh paleo-rift basin. The geodetic strain rates are calculated from the reported surface motion in the region using a modified least-square inversion scheme that utilizes distance and spatial coverage dependent weight factor on the uncertainty in the plate motion to get a reliable estimate of principal strain rates and their orientations at regular grid nodes. An optimal weighting factor yields a mean rate of compression of ~\u00a0\u2212\u00a016\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 nano strain\/yr towards north-northeast in the region. The seismic strain rates are estimated based on fault plane solutions of the significant past earthquakes (Mw\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.5) of the region using the Kostrov formulations. The seismic strain rate and stress inversion estimate indicate that the region released elastic strain at an average rate of ~\u00a0\u2212\u00a085 nano strain\/yr towards north-south in the past 350\u00a0years. A composite analysis of the geodetic and seismic strain rates indicates 900\u20133000\u00a0years of recurrence interval of major (Mw 7.8\u20138) earthquakes in the region.

Based on a seismic profile across the Manila subduction system and other geological data, we propose a strike-slip pull-apart basin model to account for the formation of the North Luzon Forearc Basin. The subduction system experienced four tectonic evolutionary stages: (1) initial subduction (~22\u201320\u00a0Ma): the Eurasian Plate began to subduct beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, and the incipient Manila Trench-North Luzon Volcanic Arc system started to form; (2) upper crustal deformation (~20\u201315\u00a0Ma): the overriding Philippine Sea Plate was strongly deformed by continuous subduction, and thrust faults, volcanic activity, and possibly strike-slip faulting weakened the forearc areas; (3) initiation of strike-slip faults (~15\u20136\u00a0Ma): continuous rotation of the Philippine Sea Plate initiated strike-slip faults in the weak zones of the forearc areas; (4) pull-apart basin formation (~6\u20130\u00a0Ma): the pull-apart basin formed in the forearc due to sinistral movement of two sets of strike-slip faults. We propose an indentation-escape process involving coupling between the sinistral strike-slip faults in the Taiwan-Luzon area and dextral strike-slip faults in the East Asia continental margin, for the evolution of the eastern South China Sea Basin margin.\n               ","36":"\n                  The link between major basement anisotropies and basin evolution is crucial for understanding the role of tectonic inheritance on continental margins. However, it is still a matter of debate how and why it happens, especially in the Equatorial Atlantic, where the interplay between Precambrian fabric and the shearing of major oceanic fractures has been studied. Here, we investigate the offshore Cear\u00e1 Basin and its basement in the central part of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin to (1) map basement anisotropies underneath marginal basins and show how Precambrian crustal domains influenced basin evolution; (2) determine the deformation style of reactivated basement faults; and (3) assess the interplay between reactivated faults and the oceanic Romanche Fracture Zone. The combined geological and geophysical data show that reactivation of NE-SW to ENE-WSW continental-scale ductile shear zones that acted as crustal weakness zones started in the Early Cretaceous under a normal stress field. Stress field inversion occurred in the Barremian during the continental breakup when the South American plate started to became an independent intraplate area under a strike-slip stress regimes. The shear zones arrest at the E-W-striking Romanche Fracture Zone, which marks the continental-oceanic boundary. The major fault offsets occurred along the Transbrasiliano Shear Zone, which represented a collisional boundary between paleocontinents in the Neoproterozoic. Fault reactivation also occurred in the eastern boundary of the Cear\u00e1 Terrace marginal ridge along the Transbrasiliano Shear Zone, uplifted during tectonic inversion. We conclude that fault reactivation mainly occurred between contrasting Precambrian terrains separated by ductile shear zones. Additionally, the folds associated with the Romanche Fracture Zone were mainly generated along reactivated faults that affected syn- to postrift units on the Equatorial Margin.\n               ","37":"\n                  Chlorite is a common, but understudied phyllosilicate mineral along continental and subduction zone faults. To understand the potential role of chlorite in different modes of fault slip, we measure the constitutive frictional properties of chlorite at low rates of deformation and shallow hydrothermal conditions by shearing powdered samples of water-saturated chlorite in the triaxial saw-cut configuration. Experiments were conducted at 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C, 130\u00a0MPa confining pressure, pore pressures from 10\u00a0MPa to 120\u00a0MPa, slip rates from 0.001 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, and shear displacements up to 7.5\u00a0mm. The frictional strength of chlorite increases with increasing temperature from 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.4 to 0.46), accompanied by an increased abundance of Riedel shears. Chlorite also transitions from rate-strengthening behavior at fast slip rates (0.1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) to rate-weakening or rate-neutral behavior at lower slip rates (0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), consistent with one hypothesis for the cause of slow slip. This transition in frictional behavior reflects different microphysical processes controlling the direct and evolution effects of friction. At low deformation rates, the magnitude and temperature sensitivity of the direct effect (a) are consistent with subcritical fracture. In contrast, the evolution effect (b) is insensitive to temperature and increases systematically with decreasing strain rate. We propose the increase in b and resulting rate-weakening behavior of chlorite with decreasing slip rate is controlled by time-dependent properties of adsorbed water to mineral surfaces.\n               ","38":"\n                  The Chuan-Dian block is one of the most seismically active regions in China.

Recently, several moderate earthquakes (MS 5.0 \u2013\u00a06.4) have successively occurred near the Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault, attracting attention from the public. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis for the 2013 MS 5.5 Eryuan earthquake sequence that occurred ~20\u00a0km southwest of the Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault. We integrate a machine-learning-based earthquake detection and location workflow and a template matching technique to derive 749 high-precision earthquakes directly from continuous streams of raw seismic data. These aftershocks started from NE of the mainshock, then bilaterally expanded towards SE and NW directions, and eventually activated a SE-trending complex fault structure with ~18\u00a0km length. We also use a waveform-based inversion algorithm to calculate the focal mechanisms of the mainshock and its relatively large aftershocks, resulting in four predominantly normal-faulting events and seven strike-slip events, which further illuminate the 2013 Eryuan sequence was accommodated by a strike-slip fault system separated by extensional stepover zones.

For example, deepwater drilling has shown the old age of the oceanic crust and its inhomogeneous composition. Seismic studies of long-range profiles with nuclear explosions and laboratory studies of mantle xenoliths at high pressures and temperatures have revealed that the advection of energy-intensive and geochemically active deep fluids is central to the formation of the upper mantle structure. A comprehensive analysis of these data provides a geodynamic model for the natural transformation of the upper mantle substance influenced by deep fluids and the formation of continents and oceans as a result of unevenly distributed degassing of the Earth. The global variability of the deep fluid advection intensity led to formation of two hemispheres: the Indo Atlantic Hemisphere where almost all continents are located and the Pacific Hemisphere that consists of oceans. This formation of the hemispheres can be explained by the specific features of the Earth's rotation in the Earth-Moon-Sun system.

Principal features include (A) a multiple ring total magnetic intensity (TMI) pattern; (B) a central quiet magnetic zone; (C) circular Bouguer gravity patterns; (D) an underlying mantle Moho rise about 10\u00a0km shallower than under the adjacent Tasman Orogenic Belt; (E) radial faults associated with magnetic and demagnetized anomalies. The minimum radius of the TMI ring is ~260\u00a0km, including a central circular quiet magnetic zone about ~120\u00a0km in radius. In the east the feature is faulted against the Early Paleozoic Lachlan Orogenic belt whereas in the west it deflects the northwest and northeast trending Early Cambrian ~525\u2013514\u00a0Ma Kanmantoo Group. An interpretation of the Deniliquin multiple-ring feature in terms of an orocline is inconsistent with the discontinuity between the feature and surrounding regional structural trends. Limits on the age of the Deniliquin feature are defined by the onset of the Adelaide fold belt at 514 +\/\u2212 5\u00a0Ma (Foden et al., 1999) and the ~427\u2013417 Ma age of intrusive Silurian granites. Basement drill cores within the Deniliquin multiple-ring feature show Boehm lamellae but did not reveal shock metamorphic textures. Based on its multiple-ring structure, structural distinction from surrounding regional structural trends, occurrence of a central quiet magnetic zone, an underlying shallower Moho and radial faults associated with magnetic bodies, we suggest the Deniliquin multiple-ring feature may represent the deep seated root zone of a large impact structure.\n               ","41":"\n                  More and more supershear rupture earthquakes, with rupture propagation velocity larger than the local shear wave speed, have been identified in recent years. However, the number of supershear events is scarce compared with large strike-slip earthquakes. This problem remains unresolved although several previous workers have offered some explanations. In this study, we utilize finite element method to simulate spontaneous dynamic rupture propagations in three dimensional half-space model with and without velocity strengthening friction layer (VSFL) near the Earth's free surface employing different frictional constitutive relations, including linear slip weakening law and rate- and state-dependent relations with aging form and slip form. The simulated results showed that the VSFL suppresses supershear rupture transition at the Earth's free surface occurring in the absence of a VSFL. In particular, we found that the minimum thickness of VSFL to prevent supershear rupture transition is ~1.4-km. Meanwhile, we reviewed a great deal of previous work on thickness of VSFL along mature faults in nature, and its thickness generally exceeds ~3-km, which is enough to suppress the transition to supershear rupture in the real-world. The presence of VSFL may be the primary reason why the supershear rupture earthquakes in nature are so scarce. In addition, the modelling results indicated that spatial heterogeneity of VSFL on the surface along fault strike affects the supershear rupture transition to some extent.

The YLHF may experience cascading ruptures with two adjacent faults (Selaha and Zheduotang). The range of activity was located north of Huiyuan Temple and south of Jingai. Deformed strata show that the YLHF is kinematically characterized by transtension. In addition, the YLHF accumulated parts of the slip rate of the single-stranded XSHF.

New apatite fission track ages range from 16.6 to 113\u00a0Ma, and apatite (U-Th)\/He ages range from 8.4 to 63.5\u00a0Ma. Age\u2013elevation relationships and thermal modeling show enhanced rock exhumation in the late Paleocene\u2013early Eocene and middle\u2013late Miocene in both transects. The results indicate two pulses of enhanced thrusting on the major thrust belts in the southern Qilian Shan in the late Paleocene\u2013early Eocene and middle\u2013late Miocene. Our findings imply an early Cenozoic onset of topographic growth in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, which was quasi-synchronous with the India\u2013Asia collision.\n               ","44":"\n                  The 85\u00b0E Ridge is a prominent linear structure in the northeastern Indian Ocean. Its nature and origin are still controversial due to the coverage of thick Bengal Fan sediments. Here we present a newly collected 400-km-long 2-D seismic reflection profile which crosses the 85\u00b0E Ridge near 11\u00b0N and shows the basement morphology and internal structures of the ridge. The ridge has a thickened crust characterized by two basement highs rising up to ~2\u20133\u00a0km above the surrounding oceanic crust and a Moho depression with amplitude of ~3\u20134\u00a0km. Typical volcanic structures formed by hotspot volcanism are identified in the ridge. Deep-rooted faults played important roles in the formation of the 85\u00b0E Ridge. They acted as the preferred conduit for the upwelling of hotspot melts, but their syn- and post-volcanic reactivations induced the collapse of volcanic sequences and the relative uplift of the East Ridge. These observations support that the 85\u00b0E Ridge near 11\u00b0N having formed by hotspot magmatism drained along a leaky fracture zone. Combined with previous results, a new single-hotspot formation model of the 85\u00b0E Ridge is proposed, in which the entire 85\u00b0E Ridge was formed by a weak and pulsating mantle plume acting on the northward drifting Indian Plate. Its along-strike variations in location, morphology, and structure in different segments are interpreted to reflect different elastic strength of the oceanic lithosphere and the existence of a pre-existing fracture zone which laterally redistributed the shallow melts.\n               ","45":"\n                  Since early 2019, the InSight mission has proven that Mars is seismically active, with more than 900 seismic events recorded. Among them, several events have characteristics close to terrestrial tectonic earthquakes. Most of these events are located on the major graben system of Cerberus fossae and, a little further north, on the secondary system of Grjot\u00e1 Valles. In this study, we invert the seismic moment tensors for nine of these tectonic marsquakes characterized by high quality data. Seven of them are located on Cerberus fossae\/Grjot\u00e1 Valles and two of them are located near the Martian dichotomy. The moment tensors allow us to interpret the nature and depth of the seismic sources at the origin of these events. In our approach, we invert the P and S body waveforms, the PP, SS, PPP and SSS secondary phase maximum amplitudes and we look for solutions with surface waves weaker than the Martian noise. From our results on moment tensors, we determine that all our events have been triggered at moderate depths of 15\u201336km. We deduce that the seven events located on Cerberus fossae have geometries similar to the fractures and are generated by tectonics. This activity is supposed to result from the reactivation of previous faults and fractures, which would have been initially induced by the propagation of volcanic dikes at depth. The two dichotomy events are due to deep compressive fracturing of the Martian lowlands. They are therefore triggered by the planetary thermal contraction. Our results are in strong agreement with recent studies on the event depths and on the previous moment tensors calculated for two events.\n               ","46":"\n                  The Sichuan basin which embodies salt and shale gas resources, is characterized by low seismicity. Seismicity in the southeastern Sichuan basin increased dramatically in recent years, including a series of moderate to strong earthquakes. We investigate seismic anisotropy in the upper crust by performing shear wave splitting analyses on local earthquakes recorded at seventeen stations around the Changning-Xingwen area, southeastern Sichuan basin between January 2016\u2013February 2021. We perform an automatic shear wave splitting analysis and obtain 2926 high-quality splitting measurements by examining 5174 local earthquakes. The delay times range between 0.08 and 0.20\u00a0s, and the anisotropy magnitude ranges between 1.9% and 5.5% with a mean of 4.2%, indicating that the study area has significant strength of anisotropy. The fast polarization directions are highly variable reflecting a combined effect of complex local structure and stress field in this area. In the southeastern part of the study area, fast directions are aligned parallel to NW- and NE-oriented surface structures, suggesting structural anisotropy. In the northwestern part of the study area, fast-polarization directions align parallel to the strike of folds and the direction of maximum horizontal compressive stress, probably reflecting the combination of both stress- and structural-controlled anisotropy. Whereas at these stations of central part, fast directions tend to align parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal compressive stress, suggesting stress-induced anisotropy. We examined the temporal variation of seismic anisotropy associated with the 2019 M\n                     S 6.0 Changning earthquake. The significant changes in splitting parameters during the Changning earthquake period may only reflect the spatial changes in seismic anisotropy.\n               ","47":"\n                  The 1928\u00a0CE volcanic activity on eastern Etna, Italy, produced wide surface deformation and high effusion rates along fissures, with excess volumes of about 50 million m3 of lavas. This, in conjunction with the low elevation of the main eruptive vents (1150\u00a0m\u00a0a.s.l.), caused the destruction of the Mascali town. Our research focuses on a multidisciplinary study from field observations and Finite Element Method modelling through COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae, with the aim of reconstructing the geometry, kinematics and origin of the system of faults and fissures formed during the 1928 event. We collected quantitative measurements from 438 sites of azimuth values, opening direction and aperture amount of dry fissures, and attitude and vertical offsets of faults. From west to east, four volcanotectonic settings have been identified, related to dike propagation in the same direction: 1) a sequence of 8 eruptive vents, surrounded by a 385-m wide graben, 2) a 2.5-km long single eruptive fissure, 3) a half-graben as wide as 74\u00a0m and a symmetric, 39-m-wide graben without evidence of eruption, 4) alignment of lower vents along the pre-existing Ripe della Naca faults. Field data, along with historical aerial photos, became inputs to FEM numerical models. The latter allowed us to investigate the connection between diking and surface deformation during the 1928 event, subject to a range of overpressure values (1\u201320\u00a0MPa), host rock properties (1\u201330\u00a0GPa) and geometrical complexity (stratigraphic sequence, layer thickness). In addition, we studied the distribution of tensile and shear stresses above the dike tip and gained insights into dike-induced graben scenarios. Our multidisciplinary study reports that soft (e.g. tuff) layers can act as temporary stress barriers and control the surface deformation scenarios (dike-induced graben, single fracture or eruptive fissures) above a propagating dike by suppressing the distribution of shear stresses towards the surface.\n               ","48":"\n                  One major critical issue in seismic hazard analysis deals with the computation of the maximum earthquake magnitude expected for a given region. Its estimation is usually based on the analysis of past seismicity that is incomplete by definition, or derived from the dimension of faults through empirical relationships with the intrinsic uncertainty in source characterization. Here, we propose a workflow aimed at providing a time-independent estimate for the maximum possible magnitude based on geological and geophysical evidence. Our estimate is also source unrelated as it is constrained by the seismic brittle volume of the crust that scales with the effective seismic energy. The seismic brittle volume is calculated considering fault kinematics and rock rheology (i.e., the brittle-ductile transition depth) over a grid that covers the entire study area. The maximum earthquake magnitude is calculated at each point of the grid based on a volume\/magnitude empirical relationship. We apply this model to Italy for which we propose a map of the maximum possible magnitudes. Maximum predicted magnitudes are 7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 for thrust faulting, 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 for normal faulting and 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37 for strike-slip faulting (\u00b1 deviation from the mean value calculated at each node). These magnitudes are locally higher than the historical record. This could be due to an overestimation of the involved volumes; smaller volumes and lower magnitudes may occur where faults are detached at decollements shallower than the brittle ductile transition or where they behave aseismically. Alternatively, strong or major earthquakes could be possible, but they have longer recurrence time and they have never been recorded yet in Italy. Regardless these values are fully reliable or not, the recurrence of earthquakes with the predicted magnitude is related to current strain rates. We conclude that a large part of the Italian territory is prone to trigger Mw\u00a0>\u00a05 earthquakes.\n               ","49":"\n                  The Mongolian Plateau located between the Siberian Craton and the North China Craton developed after multiple tectonic evolutions. It is proposed to be related to the far-field effect of the Indo-Asian collision in the Cenozoic. In this study, we inverted for high-resolution S wave velocity structures of Mongolia using Rayleigh wave tomography to constrain the plateau evolution. In particular, we obtained crustal and upper mantle seismic structures under Gobi Desert by combining Mongolian and Chinese datasets. The study reveals strong low-velocity anomalies in the lower crust immediately beneath the Hangay Dome, while the low-velocity zones are imaged beneath the dome margins in the upper mantle. The results imply that the Hangay Dome was formed by mantle upwelling into the crust from major faults following lithospheric delamination. Under the South Gobi Desert, we imaged several inclined high-velocity patches in the upper mantle, indicating the subducted slabs formed in the Paleozoic. The ancient structures in the upper mantle led the Indo-Asian collision to propagate further to southern Mongolia.\n               ","50":"\n                  An unexpectedly large uplift of 91\u00a0mm was detected by geodetic observations during the rupture of 2016 Mw 6.4 Meinong earthquake, Taiwan, which has been attributed as either a triggered anelastic and hydrologic related deformation from a proposed duplex\/mud diapir or a triggered aseismic slip on a proposed backthrust. Here, using both high-rate GNSS and free-field strong motion data, we first estimated the coseismic source model. The locations of high PGV were inferred to explain the unexpected distribution of damaged buildings approximately 25\u201330\u00a0km west of the epicenter. Then, the aseismic surface displacements during the earthquake was differentiated using the coseismic source model. The aseismic extension of 3.8 \u03bcstrain is inferred at the unexpectedly large uplift region. Combining with local geology, residual gravity anomaly, seismic tomography, interseismic leveling vertical velocities, coseismic leveling uplifts and proposed Coulomb stress changes, the accelerated mud diapirism during the earthquake triggered by slip on the deep seismogenic fault was identified as the cause of unexpectedly large coseismic uplift.\n               ","51":"\n                  The Utsira High (North Sea) records rift faulting that culminates with Jurassic-Cretaceous crustal-scale rollover towards the Viking Graben. This deformation is superimposed on Paleozoic fault-bounded basins on a substrate of Caledonian nappes. The latter contains multilevel crustal-scale shear systems that domed under the Utsira High during the Devonian, as indicated by mapping and interpretation of a large long-offset 2D seismic reflection dataset. Restorations show that isostatically driven doming from excision of overthickened crust caused uplift and erosion of basins and the underlying nappe stack. Doming took place above a crustal rollback system as a symmetrical metamorphic core complex formed. The dome discloses vertical flattening kinematics below bi-directional shear systems, evident by opposite shear-fabric kinematics on opposite dome flanks. A major detachment marks the upper boundary of a transition between upper and lower plate strain regimes, coinciding with low-reflective granitic units above strongly reflective Caledonian nappes. This detachment hosts transport-parallel corrugations that strike E-W to NE-SW. A series of deeply eroded half-grabens on top of the upper plate are bounded by pre-Permian faults exhibiting top-NE extensional kinematics. Faults sole out in the fundamental detachment level, locating the brittle-ductile transition, with all structures subsequently rotated during doming. A new localized detachment formed at a shallower level above the region of maximum crustal uplift, seen as upwards detachment migration driven by heating. Later faulting locates to the dome flanks, either rejuvenating rotated shear zones or cutting to deeper crustal levels while recording predominantly down-eastward transport. During Jurassic-Cretaceous rifting, deformation localized to the Viking Graben Boundary Fault, giving room for thick growth wedges in the Viking Graben and establishing the Utsira High as a crustal-scale rollover structure.\n               ","52":"\n                  Knowledge of the regional crustal deformation and stress field is fundamental to understanding and constrain the ongoing evolution of Hovsgol basin, northwest Mongolia. The 2021 Mw 6.7 Turt earthquake provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the local tectonic stress field and upper crust deformation. We investigate the coseismic surface displacements and invert fault slip models using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar observations and teleseismic data. The mainshock occurred as a result of normal faulting with a right-lateral strike-slip component on an NW striking plane, which is consistent with the transtensive local stress field inverted from regional focal mechanisms. It is surrounded by transpressive and strike-slip stress fields proposed by previous studies indicating regional stress heterogeneity probably controlled by the distinct structure geometries in and around Hovsgol basin. Our results also suggest that the current deformation of the Hovsgol basin is dominated by half-graben forming. Seven historical strong earthquakes (M 7) may advance the 2021 Turt earthquake by ~12% recurrence interval, based on the assumption of equal stress release from recurrence earthquakes, meanwhile, the 2021 Turt earthquake may increase the potential seismic hazard on the neighbor Mondy and South Hovsgol faults, which deserves more attention.\n               ","53":"\n                  Deformation in oblique convergent margins, especially non-plane deformation in d\u00e9collement belts within such a margin, is not fully understood. The northern Zhangbaling tectonic belt represents an oblique convergent margin to the east of the NNE\u2013SSW-striking Tan\u2013Lu Fault Zone that separates the Yangtze Block to the east from the North China Craton to the west, and it provides a good opportunity to understand deformation in the margin. The tectonic belt consists of a fold-and-thrust belt in the east and a low-angle ductile d\u00e9collement belt in the west. The fold-and-thrust belt in the marginal cover rocks indicates a pure shear-dominated deformation, and the fold axes rotated with the long axis of the horizontal finite strain ellipse. The underlying d\u00e9collement belt was involved in a non-plane deformation owing to the superposition of wrenching along the Tan\u2013Lu Fault Zone and horizontal d\u00e9collement shearing. The horizontal d\u00e9collement shearing dominated in the development of the flat-lying foliation, whereas the wrenching mostly dominated in the development of stretching lineations. Top-to-the-SSW sense of shear dominates in the central to southern parts of the d\u00e9collement belt, whereas top-to-the-SSE sense of shear is widely present in the northern part of the belt and locally in other parts. Partitioning of the non-plane deformation is shown by kinematic partitioning within the originally flat-lying d\u00e9collement belt, and it is different from the strain partitioning in a transpressional zone involved in plane deformation. The structural and geochronological data for the oblique convergent margin are consistent with sinistral faulting of the initial Tan\u2013Lu Fault Zone during the Triassic.\n               ","54":"\n                  Near-continuous monitoring both of gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and H2S) and of water temperature at Santa Venera al Pozzo thermal springs (SE foot of Mt. Etna volcano, Sicily, Italy) was conducted from December 2017 to April 2019, using a novel and cheaper Chromatography Monitoring System (CMS) coupled with a water temperature sensor. The results showed methane as predominant gas and temporal changes in gas concentrations that were in part due to daily fluctuations, which caused small amplitude variations, and in part due to non-environmental causes. These latter were correlated with the occurrence of strong earthquakes and slow tectonic events related to magmatic intrusions, but not with input of magmatic gases into the thermal aquifer, given the non-magmatic origin of all monitored gases. Methane spikes were observed during many volcano-tectonic events and call for a deep source of this gas. H2S was detected only during the strongest local tectonic events, including a Mw 4.9 earthquake, suggesting that this gas has a common origin as CH4 (i.e., mixing between microbial and thermogenic gas), but it is released only when tectonic stress is applied for sufficiently long periods as to cause H2S oversaturation in the hydrothermal aquifer. Water temperature decreases were also observed immediately after the two strongest earthquakes in the area, which helped us produce a comprehensive model to explain the observed geochemical variations. Our approach allowed revealing the great sensitivity of gases such as CH4 and especially H2S to tectonic stress, thus making them valuable indicators of impending strong tectonic or volcano-tectonic events.\n               ","55":"\n                  The uplift mechanism and geodynamic model of the northeastern (NE) Tibetan Plateau remain controversial. Two competing models have been proposed for the uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau, including crustal shortening through folding or thrust faulting and the middle-lower crustal flow model. Here, we applied the joint inversion of surface wave dispersions and receiver functions with P-wave velocity constraints on a dense linear broadband seismic array to obtain the Vs and Vp\/Vs profiles of the crust and uppermost mantle across northeastern Tibet. The inversion yields robust structural images that show stark Vs and Vp\/Vs jumps across the West Qinling fault from the Songpan-Ganzi and Kunlun-West Qinling terranes (south) to the Qilian and North China terranes (north). The results reveal that regional low-Vs\/high-Vp\/Vs anomalies present in the middle-to-lower crust, which may be the signature of viscous flow, are distinctly limited south of the West Qinling fault. In contrast, the imaged physical properties of the crust and mantle lithosphere north of this fault manifest a rigid pattern, which is inferred to be originated from the North China craton underthrust below the northern margin of the Tibetan plateau. Our seismic imaging indicates that the NE corner of the Tibetan Plateau does not currently serve as the flow channel of the ductile material from the central and northern Tibet.\n               ","56":"\n                  The east-west (E-W) trending South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) and the north-south (N-S) trending normal faults and detachments have played significant roles in the Himalayan tectonic evolution since the Miocene. The Ama Drime Massif (ADM), which is bounded by the STDS in the north as well as the Dinggye and Kharta N-S trending detachments in the east and west, respectively, is a rare place where N-S and E-W extensions interacted and thus contains key information to detect the evolution of Himalayan extensional structures. Aiming at fully reconstructing the exhumation process of the ADM and figuring out the mid-Miocene evolution of Himalayan extensional structures, this contribution provides detailed field investigations and geochronological, petrological, as well as mineral compositional studies to constrain the activity of the detachments surrounding the ADM, the metamorphic process, and the thermal state of the ADM. The geochronological results suggest that both the STDS and the Dinggye detachment were active at 13\u00a0Ma. Unlike the Dinggye detachment, whose ductile deformation terminated at ~10\u00a0Ma, the Kharta detachment maintained its ductile deformation until at least 8.5\u00a0Ma. Geochronological, petrological, and mineral compositional analyses show that the ADM paragneiss underwent muscovite dehydration melting and garnet breakdown from at least 20\u00a0Ma to 12.5\u00a0Ma, indicating a long-term exhumation of the ADM. Importantly, biotite dehydration melting and garnet growth in the ADM orthogneiss suggest a heating event in the ADM at 15\u201313\u00a0Ma. Based on the temporal relationship of different extensional structures, the exhumation of the ADM was dominated by the STDS before 15\u00a0Ma, and subsequently by the E-W extension of the Dinggye and Kharta detachments since 15\u201313\u00a0Ma. The E-W extension led to significant uplift and melting of the ADM gneisses, which made the STDS reactivate as a passive stretching detachment after its ~15\u00a0Ma cessation. In the mid-Miocene E-W extensional regime, the ADM had exhumed asymmetrically with decreasing time and amount of the exhumation from its eastern side to the western side. Together with the heating event, the asymmetric exhumation indicates the lateral delamination of the subducted Indian lithosphere beneath the ADM in the middle Miocene. From a wider perspective, the mid-Miocene E-W extensions in the Himalayan Orogen were intrinsically controlled by the deep geodynamic process of the subducted Indian lithosphere and played a important role in the diachronous cessation of the STDS.\n               ","57":"\n                  To understand the stress controls on the occurrence of a multi-fault rupture, we estimated the crustal stress between April 2013 to December 2018, i.e., before and after the Mw7.8 Kaik\u014dura earthquake that occurred in New Zealand on 13 November 2016. We used both the focal mechanism solutions from the temporary seismic networks and the GeoNet moment tensor solutions and selected the solutions that differed significantly from the mainshock fault planes and rakes. Then, we performed stress tensor inversions for the selected focal mechanism solutions. Using the stress tensor inversion results, we also calculated the slip tendency. Prior to the Kaik\u014dura earthquake, the stress regime was the strike-slip type, and the maximum eigenvalue of the stress tensor (\u03c31) was oriented WNW\u2013ESE. The stress field orientation did not change significantly after the earthquake. This suggests that the stress change during the Kaik\u014dura earthquake was too small to alter the stress orientations, implying that there may have been large differential stress prior to the Kaik\u014dura earthquake. However, the average stress ratio in different clusters changed in two different patterns after the earthquake, suggesting possible changes in the magnitude of different components of the stress tensor, or of pore pressure in different regions. A high slip tendency was observed at the hypocentre, while a low slip tendency was observed at the northern end of the Kaik\u014dura earthquake faults. This may suggest that the stress orientation and the stress ratio controlled the initiation and the end of the multi-fault rupture.

We use geological constrained analysis of the distinct aeromagnetic anomaly signatures to re-interpret the extent of the Jeypore, Krishna, Eastern Ghats, and Rengali Provinces. Forward modelling of paired gravity anomalies and an increase in magnetic response along the craton-mobile belt boundary reveal that it is dominated by high-density and highly magnetic granulite facies rocks that overthrust the low-density and low magnetic older cratonic gneissic rocks along the deep crustal faults, suggesting the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt terranes are allochthonous in nature. Two high magnetic anomaly belts in the Krishna and Eastern Ghats Provinces define a terrane-scale fold (orocline). The younger normal faults of Godavari Basin overprint the charnockitic belt in the southern part of the Eastern Ghats Province, suggesting that these high magnetic belts pre-date the Pan-African Orogeny.

The Sileru Shear Zone and Kerajung Shear Zone separates the Eastern Ghats Province-Jeypore Province and Eastern Ghats Province-Rengali Province respectively, are characterized by a sharp change in magnetic anomalies. The intra-province Nagavali-Vamsadhara Shear Zone and Mahanadi Shear Zone are characterized by subdued magnetic anomalies.

In Central Nepal, geological, geophysical, and geodetic studies indicate that the Main Himalayan Thrust has a flat-ramp-flat geometry, which causes cooling, erosion, and exhumation of rocks to be faster above the mid-crustal ramp than above the adjacent upper and lower flats. However, in the northern High Himalaya the ramp geometry, in particular its width and depth are not well resolved. To place further constraints on the northward extent and depth of the ramp, we present for the first time low-temperature thermochronological data and U-Pb zircon ages from the Gyirong region, China (northern High Himalaya). Our zircon U-Pb data show that the protolith of the High Himalayan orthogneisses is 478\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma old, and was intruded by a large leucogranite at 19.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma. The Pliocene-Quaternary cooling of the study area is constrained by apatite fission track ages and apatite and zircon (U-Th)\/He ages between ~5\u00a0Ma and\u00a0~\u00a00.5\u00a0Ma, which show a marked trend of southward-younging ages. Together with published cooling ages from Nepal farther south, the ages define a U-shaped pattern across the Main Himalayan Thrust, with ages increasing to the north and south from a minimum in the High Himalaya. A thermo-kinematic model, in which the geometry of the mid-crustal ramp was varied, explains the age data and suggests that the ramp has a dip of ~22\u00b0N. Compared to previous models, our new ages require that the ramp has a greater width (~55\u00a0km) and reaches a greater depth (~34\u00a0km) below the northern High Himalaya.

We report paleomagnetic data, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) data, and magnetic mineralogy from 47 sites distributed in the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif to investigate and compare: (1) variations in the intensity of the deformation, (2) magnitude and sense of vertical axes rotations, and (3) the character and effect of strike-slip displacements along the Bucaramanga fault and NE-striking transverse faults within the Santander Massif. Rock magnetic experiments show that hematite is the principal magnetization carrier in all these rocks. Rocks of the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera show intermediate magnetic fabrics. Magnetic fabrics of rocks from the Santander Massif, and the western flank of the Eastern Cordillera, are uniformly oblate with preservation of sedimentary fabrics. Directions of the ChRM from sites in the Eastern Cordillera (30 accepted of 35 sites) are interpreted to indicate that the axial zone has not been rotated, whereas sites located along the western flank of the northern Eastern Cordillera yield data suggesting clockwise rotations, which increase in magnitude up to 90\u00b0 in areas bounded by NE-striking transverse faults. In the Santander Massif (9 accepted of 12 sites) data suggest a mix of counterclockwise rotations (~30\u00b0) and clockwise rotations of ~40\u00b0. The inferred clockwise vertical-axis rotations in the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif of up to 45\u00b0 are interpreted to be related to tectonic inversion of pre-existing Mesozoic age normal faults during the Neogene as right-lateral faults.

Our results show distinct gaps in the evolutionary trends of crack aspect ratios and grain elastic moduli from intact rocks to fault rocks. Crack aspect ratios show a nonlinear trend from intact rock to fault gouge, and then these values in fault gouge were considerably higher than in fractured rock and transition rock. In contrast, grain elastic moduli decreased as fracture evolved with the development and subsequent extinction of shear planes and then increased markedly with the formation of fault gouge. Our results show that crack aspect ratios and grain elastic moduli are clearly related to the evolution of shear fabrics in faults.

We present new measurements of the fault scarp geomorphology along the Purgatorio Fault, and use dating of the stratigraphy within a new paleoseismic trench excavated across the fault to establish the chronology of scarp formation. We find that the most recent surface-rupturing earthquake on the Purgatorio Fault occurred sometime between 1630C.E and 1790C.E and had a moment magnitude (Mw) of ~7. We propose that this most recent surface-rupturing earthquake on the Purgatorio Fault was the 1715C.E earthquake recorded in the historical catalogue of the region, which was previously attributed to the megathrust offshore. Our results highlight the importance of establishing a paleoseismic record of onshore faults to differentiate between major megathrust and forearc earthquakes. Given the proximity of these shallow, onshore faults to coastal communities in Peru, the shallow earthquakes they generate may pose a severe, yet often overlooked, seismic hazard.\n               ","63":"\n                  After the devastating Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw 9.0, 2011) in Japan, the Korean Peninsula has experienced a higher number of large, plus Mw 5.0, earthquakes than recorded in the preceding half century of modern monitoring. In addition, seismicity has dramatically increased along with seismic waves arriving later than prior to the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, suggesting that the Korean crust has notably been perturbed. South Korea is densely populated, hence knowledge about active faults and earthquake mechanisms is of great relevance for public safety and risk mitigations. Quaternary faults, including the Chugaryeong crustal-scale fault, run through the Seoul metropolitan area and recent seismicity studies suggest that these faults are active. Based on two reflection seismic profiles, we provide compelling evidence that the depth clustered seismicity along the Chugaryeong fault is associated with the intersections of other fault systems. The two seismicity clusters, observed at two depth intervals of approximately 4.5\u20135 and 8\u20139\u00a0km, can be linked with two moderately-to-steeply-dipping bands of reflectivity interpreted to be splay faults and terminating at the Chugaryeong sub-vertical fault. We suggest that stress builds up at these fault intersections and is then released via strike-slip ruptures along the Chugaryeong fault. Time-clustered seismic events at the fault intersections support this hypothesis, indicating a start-stop mechanism is controlling the seismicity in the region at least based on nearly one decade of seismicity observations. The start-stop seismicity behaviour can possibly be used for forecasting earthquakes and their switching depth along the Chugaryeong fault.\n               ","64":"\n                  Early Cretaceous rift basins in Northeast Asia typically experienced varying degrees of post-rifting thermal subsidence and compressional deformation. However, previous workers believed that only a thin post-rifting sequence was developed in basins west of the Great Xing'an Range, making a proper understanding of the post-rift tectonic history in this part of Northeast Asia difficult. In this study, newly acquired shallow seismic reflection data were utilized to unravel the shallow deformation of the Erlian Basin, which to the west of the Great Xing'an Range contains a thin post-rifting sequence. Furthermore, we used apatite fission-track thermochronology to analyze the post-rifting deposition and uplift processes in the Erlian Basin, for which there are limited stratigraphic records. Our results show that the Erlian Basin experienced a typical post-rifting stage whose sequence from the Albian to the Campanian was not controlled by normal faults. The corresponding sedimentary thickness was up to 2\u00a0km, which contradicts the previously reported little or no post-rifting thermal subsidence. The current thin post-rifting sequence is the remaining stratum after 1.4\u20131.8\u00a0km of denudation at the end of the Erlian period. In addition, by further comparing the sedimentary thickness and time-lag in the onset of post-rifting to those of other basins in Northeast Asia, we found two driving mechanisms of rifting in Northeast Asia, which occurred simultaneously: the gravitational collapse and back-arc extension. Moreover, the basins in Northeast Asia experienced a gradual weakening in the compressional deformation from east to west during the Cenomanian to the Coniacian, and an intense compressional deformation in the east of Northeast Asia and large-scale vertical uplift in the west during the Late Cretaceous Campanian to the Eocene.\n               ","65":"\n                  The region of West Bohemia and Upper Palatinate belongs to the West Bohemian Massif. The study area is situated at the junction of three different Variscan tectonic units and hosts the ENE-WSW trending Oh\u0159e Rift as well as many different fault systems. The entire region is characterized by ongoing magmatic processes in the intra-continental lithospheric mantle expressed by a series of phenomena, including e.g. the occurrence of repeated earthquake swarms and massive degassing of mantle derived CO2 in form of mineral springs and mofettes. Ongoing active tectonics is mainly manifested by Cenozoic volcanism represented by different Quaternary volcanic structures. All these phenomena make the Oh\u0159e Rift a unique target area for European intra-continental geo-scientific research. With magnetotelluric (MT) measurements we image the subsurface distribution of the electrical resistivity and map possible fluid pathways. Two-dimensional (2D) inversion results by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) reveal a conductive channel in the vicinity of the earthquake swarm region that extends from the lower crust to the surface forming a pathway for fluids into the region of the mofettes. A second conductive channel is present in the south of their model; however, their 2D inversions allow ambiguous interpretations of this feature. Therefore, we conducted a large 3D MT field experiment extending the study area towards the south. The 3D inversion result matches well with the known geology imaging different fluid\/magma reservoirs at crust-mantle depth and mapping possible fluid pathways from the reservoirs to the surface feeding known mofettes and spas. A comparison of 3D and 2D inversion results suggests that the 2D inversion results are considerably characterized by 3D and off-profile structures. In this context, the new results advocate for the swarm earthquakes being located in the resistive host rock surrounding the conductive channels; a finding in line with observations e.g. at the San Andreas Fault, California.\n               ","66":"\n                  On 20 July 2017 (22:31:10 UTC), an Mw6.6 earthquake took place offshore Kos Island, in the southeastern (SE) Aegean Sea, producing severe damage and loss of life in the city of Kos and several smaller cities and villages both in Kos Island (Greece) and in the Bodrum peninsula (Turkey). All available seismological data until the end of October 2017 were gathered from seismological stations located in Greece and Turkey for the relocation process. The relocated aftershocks are clustered at least in three distinctive patches, creating a zone reaching a total length of about 40\u00a0km, elongated in a nearly east-west direction, and are mainly concentrated at depths 8\u201315\u00a0km, with the main shock hypocenter placed at ~13\u00a0km, implying a seismogenic layer of 7\u00a0km thickness, indicative for normal faulting earthquakes with Mmax\u00a0~\u00a06.5. The aftershock fault plane solutions are predominantly normal faulting in response to the north\u2013south extension of the back arc Aegean area and consistent with the broader regional stress field. We also applied the satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) technique to define the coseismic surface displacements, revealing the range of deformation on the Island and the surrounding mainland. We combined this deformation field along with the available vectors of displacement measured by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technique with the seismological data to determine the fault geometry and rupture process. The resulted variable slip model indicates a rather elliptical rupture area of 306\u00a0km2, with the coseismic slip ranging between 0.5 and 2.3\u00a0m. The peak moment release occurred in the depth interval of 9\u201311\u00a0km, consistent with the depth distribution of seismicity in the study area. We used the variable slip model to calculate Coulomb stress changes and investigate possible triggering due to stress transfer to the nearby fault segments.\n               ","67":"\n                  With an excess of 75 Moz of gold produced, the Timmins-Porcupine mining camp in the Abitibi green stone belt is the largest gold producing camp in Canada. Most of the endowment is associated with two major, east-west striking, crustal fault zones, the Porcupine Destor fault and the Pipestone fault. The seismic survey presented in this study crosses these prolific fault systems in the Matheson area, which represents the eastern extension of the Timmins-Porcupine mining camp. The survey includes two receiver lines, the east and west profiles, with unequal receiver spacing among them and seismic shots only acquired along the east profile. After careful considerations, we treated the survey as a parallel geometry and designated the east and the west processing profiles to potentially image subsurface architecture in crystalline rock environment. We considered three scenarios to process the data: the entire survey, the east, and the west profiles individually considered. A full pseudo pre-stack time migrated 3D cube of the Archean crust documents the usefulness in imaging the extent of the geological features. By integrating the 2D and 3D seismic images with the local magnetic susceptibility isosurface model, we interpreted the Porcupine Destor fault to dip shallowly to the south and the Pipestone fault as steeply-dipping\/subvertical. The techniques used here can be further applied to other areas with similar dense infrastructure requiring imperfect acquisition survey geometry, including crooked lines, to produce fully 3D or pseudo seismic cubes in such areas of great exploration interest.\n               ","68":"\n                  Broadband and long-period magnetotelluric (MT) soundings were collected along a 600-km-long EW-trending profile across the southwestern segment of the Jiangnan Orogenic Belt (JOB) to explore the possible remnants of ancient tectonic processes beneath the central South China Block (SCB). Beneath the JOB, the resistivity model reveals a west-dipping, trans-lithosphere conductor (<20 \u03a9\u00a0\u2219\u00a0m) embedded within the relatively thick (80\u2013120\u00a0km) and highly resistive (>1000 \u03a9\u00a0\u2219\u00a0m) lithosphere, possibly associated with relics of the Neoproterozoic subduction zone between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks. The crustal portion of this conductor is interpreted as solid conducting materials (e.g., graphite, sulfide) that were emplaced into the crust during subduction and orogenesis, whereas its lithospheric mantle portion is more likely to be volatile-bearing minerals formed by subduction-related metasomatic processes. We attribute the greatly reduced asthenospheric resistivities (1~10 \u03a9\u00a0\u2219\u00a0m) below the JOB to low-degree melting of the early-formed metasomatized mantle. In contrast, the lithosphere of the Cathaysia Block is evidently thinned (60\u2013100\u00a0km) and segmented by several subvertical, lithospheric-scale conductors (1~30 \u03a9\u00a0\u2219\u00a0m) that are likely associated with fossil fluid pathways along reactivated shear\/fault zones. Notably, the thinnest lithosphere sits above a prominent low-resistivity (10\u00a0~\u00a030 \u03a9\u00a0\u2219\u00a0m) anomaly in the asthenospheric mantle and is spatially coincident with the location of Late Jurassic basaltic outcrops. We interpret these features as signs of lithospheric extension and asthenospheric upwelling driven by roll-back of the Paleo-Pacific Plate during the Late Mesozoic.

Using field investigations and satellite imagery interpretations, we determined detailed geometry and kinematics of the West Helanshan fault. The West Helanshan fault is divided into three segments, including the northern, middle, and southern segments, based on varying fault strike, slip sense, and geomorphic expression. The northern and middle segments are dominated by right-lateral strike-slip motion as indicated by linear fault traces, horizontally offset streams and terrace risers, relatively insignificant vertical offset, and frequently changing facing direction of fault scarps. The late Quaternary right-slip rate is estimated to be 0.2\u20130.4\u00a0mm\/yr, which is relatively low comparing with other strike-slip faults in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, based on 10Be-dated offset fluvial\/alluvial surfaces. The southern segment shows conspicuous fault scarps with significant systematic vertical offset, which has a reverse component as revealed in the trench. The timing of the most recent earthquake revealed in the trench is constrained to be between 6.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0ka and 5.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0ka. Notably, the West Helanshan fault cuts through the city center of Azuoqi town, which is the capital of Azuoqi county and has about 100,000 residents, carrying high potential earthquake hazard in the future.

Historical large earthquakes were hosted on the XJF, though its seismic hazard in the near future is under debate. In this study, we utilize portable broad-band seismic network to unravel the microseismic activities along XJF, and to further investigate the fault structures and their properties. Adopting PALM, a newly developed earthquake detection algorithm, we obtained ~13,000 relocated events. The micro-seismicity reveals widespread off-fault structures showing conjugate geometry, while the major faults present low seismicity. The fault branches conjugate to the main-fault present intensive microseismicity, which hosts repeating events and presents high b-value. Regional GPS stations reflect slips are mostly concentrated along the XJF, while the slip rate on off-fault branches correlates with seismic activities on these structures. Combining with other recent seismological and magnetotellurics evidences, we suggest a low strength on these off-fault structures, which may partially release tectonic stress loading and serve as a barrier for future big earthquakes. On the XJF, the microseismic events are clustered on the fault junctions with low b-value. A special set of clusters between 25\u00b0N to 25.5\u00b0N show an along-strike variation of depth from 10 to 25-km, imaging the boundary between creeping and locked fault portions. We revisit the seismic hazard problem of XJF, and conclude that XJF is at the late stage of inter-seismic period.\n               ","71":"\n                  In the past decades, the arc-continent collision in Taiwan was commonly interpreted as a relatively continuous process with an invariant plate convergence vector for at least the last 6\u20135\u00a0Ma. This steady convergence, including the rate and the obliquity, between the subducting continental margin and the plate boundary suggest a propagating collision with a space-time equivalence along the developing orogen. More recently, detailed low-temperature geochronologic and plate reconstructions suggest that the plate convergence changed from highly oblique to nearly orthogonal in the last 2 to 1\u00a0Ma. This early phase of oblique convergence, driven primarily by the northward motion of the Philippine Sea Plate wrt the Eurasian Plate, implies a significant \u2018fossil\u2019 component of left-lateral, strike-slip motion along the presumably north-trending plate boundary. A synthesis of available data compiled in this study suggests that previously uncharacterized zones of strike-slip deformation exist in the Tailuko Belt, and here we document: 1) the distribution of horizontal shear, 2) the kinematics of deformation, 3) the age of deformation, and 4) regional consistency between geologic studies and plate reconstructions. Horizontal shear may also be recorded at shallow structural levels in southern Taiwan by brittle faults and block rotations. Integration of these new data with previously published kinematic data across strike also suggests plate convergence was partitioned with strike-slip motion in the retrowedge (i.e., the Tailuko Belt) and shortening in the prowedge (i.e., the Slate Belt).\n               ","72":"\n                  What are the geodynamic processes during the transition from the onshore NE Taiwan collision to the offshore southwest Okinawa back-arc basin opening associated to the Ryu-Kyu subduction? What is the local neotectonic scheme of this transition (e.g.: structural sketch map of the outcropping volcanic edifice highlighting major faults and their associated earthquakes)? These are some of the fundamental questions adressed to the Kuei-Shan Tao volcanic island (KST hereafter) which is the unique emerged volcanic outcrops situated within this geodynamic transition area.\n                  Several incompatible KST geological mappings had been published without any faults, nor dykes, nor feeders (Ichikawa, 1934; Hsu, 1963; and Chiu et al., 2010) that needed to be updated and completed on the structural point of view. In order to do so, we acquired a new high resolution UAS-drone topography (Digital Surface Model) through photogrammetric processing, with a ground resolution <10\u00a0cm. We analyse and interprete it in detail using morphostructural photo-interpretation methods. Field works on KST is restricted due to technical and administrative reasons, so we compare our morphostructural map to the shoreline outcrops observed from a boat survey. Then, we have updated the Kuei-Shan Tao geological mapping (lava flows and pyroclastic falls), and the structural scheme as well as the major erosionnal landslide processes. Taking into account the re-interpretation of surroundings offshore bathymetry, old and new seismic profiles, the different drillings done in the Kuei-Chia northern flank, previous geophysical works, the existing massive andesite datings), as well as the inferred stress regimes deduced from the earthquake's focal mechanisms, we propose a KST neotectonic map. We propose also a new scenario for the recent KST volcanic evolution. Kuei-Shan Tao geology and geodynamics may have a so great importance for the 0.5 millions citizens of the so close flat lying Ilan Plain in terms of natural hazards (eruptions, tsunamis, earthquakes\u2026).\n               ","73":"\n                  Some conceptual models proposed for explaining the Hindu Kush intermediate-depth seismicity assumed that a subhorizontal fracture was migrating laterally, from east toward west, along the strike of a subducted tectonic plate. The present study has identified a distinct cluster of earthquake hypocenters, likely corresponding to the advancing tip of the subhorizontal fracture. Those hypocenters belonged to a set of fairly moderate earthquakes (5.6\u00a0\u2264\u00a0M\u00a0\u2264\u00a06.5), which had not been, so far, explicitly addressed in the Hindu Kush seismo-tectonic interpretations, and which were proven to be virtually the only events displaying a failure regime characteristic to a laterally propagating breakoff \u2013 namely, reverse-fault focal mechanisms with subhorizontal compression axes parallel to the slab strike. A separate, upper-positioned hypocenter cluster was noticed to include all the M\n                     w\u00a0\u2265\u00a07 intermediate-depth earthquakes: it was conjectured, relying on a previously published numerical model, that those strong events could be triggered by upward transfer of the viscoelastic stress induced by the slab pull increase caused by an episode of lateral breakoff advance. At the same time, as the inferred breakoff fracture enables the deeper segment of the plate to detach from the shallower segment, the plate region situated above the severed region is relieved of the gravitational pull that was imposed by the deeper, and currently detached, plate segment. In response to the resulting crustal rebound, the surface topography is expected to exhibit down-tilting to the west. Such an anticipation seems to be confirmed by the catchments of several streams which flow roughly perpendicular to the intermediate-depth earthquakes epicentral domain: relevant geomorphic indices (the swath profile average and maximum elevation curves; the transverse hypsometric integral \u2013 THi; the transverse topographic symmetry factor \u2013 T-vector) computed for the concerned valleys consistently suggested larger uplift rates in the east, as compared to those manifest further to the west.\n               ","74":"\n                  The North China Craton is one of the oldest continental nuclei in the world. However, extreme lithospheric modification has occurred since the Mesozoic, of which the most typical area is the Yanshan orogenic belt. In this research, a 3-D lithospheric electrical structure beneath the Yanshan belt and adjacent areas was obtained using magnetotelluric array data, which reveals the regional heterogeneity. Notably, the crust and upper mantle (< 100\u00a0km) within the Yanshan belt, especially in its southern part, are characterized by high resistivity (> 1000 \u03a9m). These features are interpreted to be a relic cratonic lithosphere mainly composed of highly depleted olivine. A lithosphere-scale relatively high-conductivity zone (~ 100 \u03a9m, near EW-trending), which roughly lies beneath the Miyun-Xifengkou-Qinglong fault coincides with the boundary of Archean greenstone belt and also the Mesozoic granitic zone, probably indicating a reactivated Precambrian lithospheric weak\/shear zone within Yanshan belt. In contrast, the lower crust and upper mantle of the Bohai Bay basin show large areas of high conductivity, which may result from the modification of the crust and mantle by the upwelled asthenospheric materials. Additionally, the epicenters of several historic destructive earthquakes, including the 1976 Tangshan earthquake (M7.8), are mainly located near the high- and low-resistivity boundary at the conjunction of the Yanshan belt and the Bohai Bay basin. The fragmentation of brittle crustal rocks mainly happened in where the tectonic stresses concentrated, which might result from the rheological difference between the high-resistivity ancient and the high-conductivity modified lithosphere. In these places, intense seismicity would be induced.\n               ","75":"\n                  In our study we examined the possibility of using strain rate data, determined from geodetic satellite measurements for estimations of magnitude of contemporary stress in a relatively stable area of northern Poland, comprised of fragments of the East European Craton, the Teisseyre-Tornquist Tectonic Zone and the Palaeozoic Platform. The strain rates and their principal directions were determined from 63 GNSS stations lacking special stabilization. The method for filtrating the unstable stations allowed us to eliminate half of these stations from the final strain rate calculations that included data averaging in a correlation radius of 150\u00a0km. A comparison of the horizontal strain directions determined by geodetic methods with the directions of contemporary stress based on borehole data (four of which were determined in this study) showed a high degree of convergence. Also the trends of strain rate variations showed consistency with integrated lithospheric strength of main tectonic units. The strain rates obtained are consistent with those published for the adjacent areas. Stress magnitudes were estimated by calibrating the timing of elastic strain accumulation by earthquakes in the Sambia Peninsula (Kaliningrad Oblast) and assuming a transient state of elastic strain on the craton. Our results indicate that the crystalline upper crust in the analysed part of the craton is in the strike-slip faulting stress regime prevailing over the normal faulting stress regime. The present state of an elastic strain has been accumulated over the last few million years causing stress being far from the critical state in the Mohr-Coulomb frictional criteria, except of the seismically active Sambia Peninsula.\n               ","76":"\n                  Bends and stepovers in strike-slip fault systems along active plate boundaries are widespread and introduce stress heterogeneities, affecting the regional strain field. The strain field associated with these complex fault structures has been extensively studied. Asymmetric uplift of the Lebanon Mountains, located at the fringe of an active plate boundary, the Dead Sea Fault system (DSF), together with subsidence of the Lower Galilee in northern Israel provides an exceptional example of the complex deformational pattern associated with a restraining bend. The deformation field with respect to the restraining bend is expressed by the asymmetric uplift of the Lebanon Mountains, west of the DSF. This asymmetry along with the subsidence of the Lower Galilee, an extensional region in northern Israel, could not be explained only by the impact of the restraining bend, ignoring additional regional tectonic features. We present the results of 3-D numerical modeling of the distributed deformation, utilizing damage rheology for brittle rock deformation of the seismogenic crust overlaying viscoelastic mantle. We use available geological and regional seismicity data to implement the realistic lithosphere structure and to delineate the major faults in the model as localized weak zones. The modeling results highlight the impact of several factors on the spatial distribution of crustal deformation, demonstrated by running different model scenarios. These scenarios allow us to isolate the impact of each tectonic element and show the strain pattern resulting from their superposition, starting with a restraining bend acting in a homogeneous layered crust. Our modeling results suggest that the extension observed in the Lower Galilee region and the asymmetric uplifted pattern west of the Lebanese Restraining Bend is the outcome of three interacting factors, which are the sinistral strike-slip motion along the Lebanese Restraining Bend, the significant variations in the crustal structure (depth to Moho), and the slow extension of the Irbid-Azraq rift zone.\n               ","77":"\n                  The large-scale (tens to hundreds of kilometers long) but small-displacement (<2\u00a0km) strike-slip faults in the Shunbei region of the Tarim Basin, NW China, provide an opportunity to document the role of mechanical stratigraphy in an intracratonic strike-slip situation. Uniaxial compression test results and dipole acoustic logging data illustrate that the lower Paleozoic mechanical profile in the Shunbei region consists of 2 incompetent layers (middle Cambrian and Upper Ordovician) and 3 competent layers (Sinian\u2013lower Cambrian, upper Cambrian\u2013Middle Ordovician, and Silurian). Borehole and high-resolution 3D seismic data illustrate that the 3 competent layers are characterized by low-amplitude folds and isolated brittle faults. The discrete element method (DEM) modeling results indicate that mechanical stratigraphy is an important factor controlling the soft-linked faulting style that is independent of multiphase deformation. A pre-existing structure promotes the formation of narrow and localized fault zones. The early\u2013middle Silurian evolution of the Shunbei No. 1 fault zone reflects a classic stratigraphically decoupled deformation model: the middle fault arrays (upper Cambrian\u2013Middle Ordovician layers) and en echelon normal faults (Silurian layer) synchronously experienced left-lateral slip. These two styles of faulting have different geometries (fault dips, slips, and arrangements) but are kinematically coupled and genetically related. This proposed deformation model provides mechanical support to document deeply buried structures by characterizing genetically related shallow structures, which may be widely employed as multiphase inheritance structures with mechanical stratigraphy. We also point out that vertical fault connectivity is a key research aspect of hydrocarbon exploration in the Shunbei oilfield.\n               ","78":"\n                  We combine structural and microstructural data with stable and clumped isotopes of syntectonic calcite veins or slickenfibers of five thrust and four strike-slip faults to characterize the paleofluid circulation in the Jura fold-and-thrust belt, eastern France. Syn-tectonic fluid circulation occurred along high permeability networks of breccias, foliated fault rocks, and discrete fault surfaces. At the regional scale, fluid circulation was dominated by cold meteoric fluids that infiltrated downward along both thrust and strike-slip faults, with various degrees of interaction with the carbonate host rocks. Fault-related mineralizations precipitated from fluids with \u03b4\u206018O values between \u22120.8\u2030 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.8\u2030 (V-SMOW) at temperatures between 8\u00a0\u00b0C and 54\u00a0\u00b0C. The \u03b4\u206018O values of the paleofluids partly overlap those of modern meteoric waters of the region. The calcite mineralizations yielding the highest calculated \u03b4\u206018O paleofluid values are also the warmest ones and those with the heaviest carbon isotope signal, indicating strong host rock buffering and fluid heating at depth. A contribution of deep fluids from Permo-Triassic rocks cannot be excluded, but not likely. This could be related to the presence of Middle Jurassic Opalinus Clay Formation, which acted as a regional low-permeability barrier in the sedimentary succession. This can create two different fluid circulation systems characterized by warm and partly basement-derived fluids and by cold meteoric fluids, respectively, below and above the Middle Jurassic Opalinus Clay Formation. Results from this study can be used for modeling fluid circulation at the regional scale in carbonate-dominant foreland fold-and-thrust belts elsewhere in the world.\n               ","79":"\n                  The Balearic Promontory (Spain) is of key importance to understand the tectonic kinematics of the westernmost Mediterranean, because its continued marine sedimentation has recorded the contrasting effects expected from competing geodynamic models proposed for the region. Near the center of this promontory, between the islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, the Miocene to Pleistocene stratigraphy of the Central Mallorca Depression presents an ideal record of the tectonic deformation that has received only limited attention. We use a widespread dataset of 2D seismic reflection profiles to identify, interpret and map the main prominent reflectors and extrapolate the thickness of the pre-Messinian and Pliocene-Quaternary sedimentary units. We then quantify the timing and style of deformation related to the various fault systems. Our results reveal for the first time a series of aligned small depressions bounded by extensional and strike-slip faults and filled with Plio-Quaternary sediment, perfectly aligned with the sub-basins of the onshore Mallorca Graben. A subsidence analysis confirms this correlation. We identify non-cylindrical deformation within the Plio-Quaternary unit that is remarkably similar to that observed onshore, suggesting continuous fault zones from the Central Mallorca Depression to Mallorca Island. We interpret an intra-PQ unconformity as the marker of a transition from extensional to strike-slip tectonic regime. The strike-slip stage is represented by both transpressional and transtensional structures, interpreted as restraining\/releasing bends respectively and step overs along the faults. We show that these offshore faults in the Central Mallorca Depression overlap well with seismic epicenters and suggest major active strike-slip corridors that have an onshore continuity both until eastern Mallorca and in the southwestern Ibiza margin. The role of previous tectonic inherited structures (rifting, Betic thrusts, post-orogenic collapse) on the deformation reported here is discussed and we propose a tentative sketch that integrates our results in a Miocene to Present-day evolution at regional scale.\n               ","80":"\n                  In foreland thrust systems, the complex structural geometry creates greater difficulties in constraining the seismotectonics of moderate magnitude earthquakes without pronounced surface ruptures and in assessing future seismic risk.

Based on surface investigations, geological mapping, and interpretations of deep seismic reflection profiles, we suggest that the Urumqi foreland thrust belt is a typical active wedge thrust system. Two connected fault segments of the gently south-dipping blind fault ramp and the north-dipping Xishan back-thrust fault merge at a depth of ~11\u00a0km and bound the wedge-shaped fault block. Analyses of the focal mechanism and aftershock distribution indicate that the seismogenic fault responsible for the M 5.1 Urumqi event is the south-dipping Xishan fault ramp with a dip angle of ~10\u201330\u00b0, which highlights the potential seismic hazards of the unruptured north-dipping Xishan back-thrust ramp. The four fault branches on the hanging wall of the Xishan fault are interpreted as flexural-slip thrusts. Our results indicate that multiple surface ruptures over a 6\u00a0km-wide area may form if a large earthquake occurs along the Xishan fault system.\n               ","81":"\n                  In this study, we present new two- and three-dimensional resistivity models of the Huya fault region in the east margin of the Tibetan Plateau, imaged with magnetotelluric (MT) method. According to those models, a high-angle low-resistivity anomaly beneath the Huya fault is revealed, which is interpreted as a crustal thrust fault. The Minshan Uplift is imaged as a two-layered resistivity structure. The Bikou Block exhibits relatively uniform high-resistivity characteristics in our models, with its basement connected to a high-resistivity body beneath the Longmenshan fault belt. Thus, we infer that the Bikou Block belongs to the Yangtze Block. The Longmenshan fault belt exhibits strips of alternating high- and low-resistivity anomalies in the upper crust, with its middle and lower crust being highly resistive. The middle and lower crust of the western study region shows low resistivity, with its geometry changed greatly as it extends southeastward and upward. This is interpreted as an eastward channel of escaping material of the Tibetan Plateau. However, this channel is imaged to be blocked horizontally by the Bikou Block near the Huya fault, causing part of mid-to-lower crustal material to be upwelling, resulting in the Minshan Uplift. Another part of the low resistivity anomaly extended southeastward and was blocked by the lithospheric high-resistivity body beneath the Longmenshan fault belt, and then extended to the northeast and the southwest.\n               ","82":"\n                  The NNW-SSE trending Sierra Palomera fault is characterized as an active, nearly pure extensional fault with mean transport direction towards N230\u00b0E, consistent with the ENE-WSW extension trajectories of the recent to present-day regional stress field. Its macrostructure is described from surface geology and magnetometric and electromagnetic surveys, which have allowed identifying two subsidiary, nearly parallel normal faults (antithetic and synthetic, respectively). The structural contour map of an extensive planation surface, dated to 3.8\u00a0Ma, provides a maximum fault throw s.s. of 330\u00a0m for the main fault (480\u00a0m including bending), and a net slip rate of 0.09\u20130.10\u00a0mm\/a (0.13\u20130.15\u00a0mm\/a including bending). Trench study focussed on the subsidiary antithetic fault shows evidence of its activity during Middle-Late Pleistocene times, offsetting ca. 2.5\u00a0m the slope of a well-preserved alluvial fan. Detailed analysis and retrodeformation of the antithetic fault and other minor ruptures in the trench has allowed defining seven deformation events. The lack of a consistent age model for the involved sedimentary sequence makes them almost meaningless in terms of paleoseismic history. However, geometry and sequential development of meso-scale faults (intermediate between seismic-scale and analogue models) allows unravelling the extensional deformation history within the hanging-wall block of the Sierra Palomera fault. Progressive rupture patterns reveal shifting from dominantly synthetic to dominantly antithetic faulting, suggesting both kinematical control linked to rollover growth, and dynamical control by the regional stress field.\n               ","83":"\n                  The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence in Kyushu included a foreshock (M\n                     \n                        w\n                      6.2) on 14 April and the mainshock (M\n                     \n                        w\n                      7.0) on 16 April, both of which were caused by fault ruptures at the intersection of the Futagawa and Hinagu fault zones. However, not all sections of the two fault zones were ruptured during the mainshock; in particular, although the northernmost (Takano\u2013Shirahata) section of the Hinagu fault zone ruptured, the rupture did not propagate to southern sections of the fault zone. We examined fault geometry, geological structure, and seismicity around the fault zones, and conducted numerical Coulomb stress change and slip tendency analyses to investigate rupture conditions around the source faults. Fault geometry and slip tendencies indicated that before the foreshock, the source fault (the Futagawa section of the Futagawa fault zone) was favorable for rupture. Seismicity analysis showed that, before the foreshock, a remarkable low-seismicity zone existed where the rupture ultimately terminated. A material or structural boundary in the fault zones probably caused this anomalous seismicity and affected rupture propagation during the mainshock. Coulomb stress change analysis indicated a positive stress change in the Hinagu section just after the mainshock. In addition, the strikes of the optimum slip planes were parallel to that of the Hinagu section just after the mainshock, and slip tendencies in the section increased at that time. These results suggest that the Hinagu section was brought closer to failure just after the mainshock. In contrast, later in the post-mainshock period, the strikes of the optimum slip planes were oblique to that of the Hinagu section and the slip tendencies of the section were low. These results suggest that the favorability for a future rupture of the Hinagu section has declined since 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence.\n               ","84":"\n                  The depth extent of low velocity fault zones is still a matter of debate due to the lack of vertical resolution for most seismic methods. Autocorrelations and cross-correlations of seismic ambient noise provide us new constraints on this issue by obtaining the shallow subsurface reflections without the need of active sources or earthquakes. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) method can also give constraints on this interface and does not need any extra cost of data collection. In this study, we used one-month continuous seismic data from a dense linear array deployed crossing the Chenghai Fault (CHF) in Yunnan, southwest China. Single station autocorrelation and adjacent station pair cross-correlation methods were used to retrieve body wave reflections from the interface of the shallow crustal low-velocity zone (LVZ). The HVSR method was also performed to delineate the shape of the LVZ. Results show an inverted trapezoidal LVZ which extends to ~1.0\u00a0km depth across the fault zone with a lateral extent of ~3\u00a0km. Previous studies based on ambient noise surface-wave tomography and teleseismic travel time analysis in the same area show similar characteristics, consistent with the interpretation of our results.\n               ","85":"\n                  The 2021 Mw 7.3 Maduo earthquake, which hit the high mountain area of the internal Bayan Har Block in the central Tibetan Plateau, generated a\u00a0~\u00a0154\u00a0km-long, nearly E-W-striking surface rupture zone. Field observations indicate prominent surface breaks characterized by discontinuous shear faults, en echelon tensional fissures, and mole track structures, revealing a dominantly left-lateral strike-slip motion with a maximum sinistral offset of ~2.7\u20132.8\u00a0m and general offset of ~1.0\u20131.5\u00a0m. The west part of the Maduo surface rupture zone occurred along the pre-existing Jiangcuo fault. Its east portion cut through some WNW-trending tectonics, indicating a previously unknown fault. The epicenter and slip distribution show a bilateral rupture for the Maduo quake. The complex 3D geometry of the Maduo seismogenic fault has controlled the occurrence of aftershocks and the multimodal distribution of coseismic displacements. The abnormally long Maduo surface rupture zone suggests that the rupture area-magnitude relationship might be more applicable than the rupture length-magnitude relationship for the magnitude estimation of a paleo-event. The occurrence of the Maduo earthquake challenges the active block model which used to predict little or no slip partitioning and large earthquakes in the block interior. A reappraisal of seismic hazard along intra-block faults with low strain rates is needed, especially across densely populated regions.\n               ","86":"\n                  The Fujian-Taiwan Strait-Taiwan area has undergone multiple periods of alternate compressional and extensional tectonic events, forming a complex geological structure. The underground structure and deformation characteristics, reflected by three-dimensional velocity structure and anisotropy, are the basis for analyzing the influences of different geological processes. In this study, utilizing 2\u00a0years of continuous waveform data from more than 100 permanent stations in Fujian and Taiwan, we extracted Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data based on the cross-correlation of vertical and tangential components. A direct inversion method was employed to obtain the 3-D shear wave velocity and radial anisotropy structure of the crust. Vertical and horizontal polarized shear wave velocity structures were also inverted separately, and then used to calculate another radially anisotropic velocity model for comparison. The results show that the middle and lower crust of Fujian and the Taiwan Strait are dominated by positive radial anisotropy attributed to the near-horizontal alignment of minerals caused by extension. Although in an extension environment, most of the shallow crust exhibits weak anisotropy due to the vertical cutting of fractures and fissures, except for the strait area covered by horizontal sedimentary layers leading to strong positive radial anisotropy. In addition to the influence of faults and other shallow structures, the stress distribution caused by metamorphism also plays an important role; thus, the upper crust of the marine metamorphic belt shows negative radial anisotropy. Different from the strong positive anisotropy in other parts of the lower crust, relatively weak anisotropy appears beneath the Penghu area, which is related to two-stage Cenozoic extension.\n               ","87":"\n                  This study integrates field, geochronological and geochemical data to constrain fluid circulation in the damage and core zone of the seismogenic Monte Morrone Fault System (MMFS), central Apennines (Italy). Faulting along the MMFS evolved from a diffuse deformation at the damage zone towards progressive localisation of a narrower fault core and, finally, to (re)activation of discrete slip surfaces at shallower crustal conditions. Multiple generations of carbonate mineralisations, including veins and slickfibers, occur along the main fault surfaces. Carbonate mineralisations are locally fractured and incorporated in the surrounding cataclasites, documenting repetitive structurally-controlled fluid infiltration during transient episodes of permeability creation and destruction. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of the carbonate mineralisations document a dominant meteoric water source probably mixed with deeper circulating waters having longer residence time. Clumped-isotope yield formation temperatures of vein and slickenfibers in the range between 23 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C. U-Th dating of carbonate mineralisations yield Middle Pleistocene ages (from 268 to 189\u00a0ka BP), with a 10\u201315-ka cyclicity that we link to the coseismic rejuvenation of the structural permeability in the fault zone. We propose that fault-related mineralisations recorded the interactions among tectonic deformation and climate during the Quaternary. Our study is the first documentation of fault-controlled recurrence intervals in fluid infiltration in a seismically active fault of central Apennines.\n               ","88":"\n                  On 25 June 2020, a Mw 6.3 earthquake struck Yutian county. The earthquake nucleated on a normal fault in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau. Through jointly inverting local seismic and teleseismic waveform data as well as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Line-of-Sight (LOS) displacement data, the spatiotemporal rupture properties of this earthquake were resolved to investigate and better understand regional crustal extension mechanisms. Inversion results show that this event ruptured along one main asperity concentrated within a depth range of 4.1\u201313.3\u00a0km with a maximum slip of ~0.9\u00a0m. The rupture front propagated initially around the hypocenter and then unilaterally toward the north. The whole process lasted approximately 8\u00a0s and released a total scalar seismic moment of 3.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01018\u00a0Nm (Mw 6.3). The energy-based average stress drop was estimated in the range of 1.9\u20133.0\u00a0MPa. The radiation efficiency was estimated to be 10.0\u201315.8%, which is relatively low, demonstrating that most of the accumulated strain energy dissipated during rupturing. We suggest that the earthquake was possibly related to the nearby Cenozoic volcano in consideration of the dissipated rupture of the source and the west-dipping causative fault located on the western edge of the volcano. Both the westward motion of the western Kunlun block and the eastward motion of the Kunlun-Qaidam block were responsible for the EW-trending crustal extension in the Yutian district. We supposed that the 2020 normal faulting earthquake was primarily attributed to the different velocities of the Kunlun-Qaidam block moving eastward. Additionally, according to an analysis of coseismic Coulomb stress interactions, the previous 2008 Mw 7.1, 2012 Mw 6.2, and 2014 Mw 6.9 Yutian earthquakes contribute small Coulomb stress disturbance on the hypocenter of the 2020 Mw 6.3 Yutian earthquake which suggest that previous Yutian earthquakes have a limited effect on triggering the 2020 event.\n               ","89":"\n                  Development of a resource play is subject to intrinsic risks. These may include the risk of incurring unexpected costs or shutdowns due to anomalous induced seismicity, or risks associated with reservoir stimulation that differs from prior empirical or numerical models. These two risks may be related causally, as completion effectiveness could be adversely affected by loss of fracture fluids into fault systems and\/or damage zones, irrespective of the occurrence of induced seismicity. We outline a novel strategy for pre-operational risk assessment that is guided by the interpretation of 3-D seismic data, principles of structural geology and available induced seismicity data from surrounding operations. We integrate regional seismic structural mapping with results of previous experimental studies to develop a corridor-based risk-assessment approach. This approach is illustrated by a case study from the Duvernay play in Alberta, Canada, where subtle basement-rooted strike-slip faults and associated Riedel shears have been activated during previous hydraulic-fracturing completion programs. Unlike previous case studies in this area, we combine analysis of several adjoining 3-D seismic and induced seismicity datasets in order to map regional risk corridors. Given the general infeasibility of exhaustive detection and mapping of all potentially seismogenic faults, our approach relies on established structural principles, analog settings (flower structures) and analysis of fault-slip potential to quantify the probability of activation within a defined corridor that contains interpreted faults.\n               ","90":"\n                  We use GPS and InSAR data to examine the present-day kinematics of the Tuz G\u00f6l\u00fc Fault Zone with a view to documenting an \u2018intra-plate-like\u2019 behaviour within a highly active plate boundary zone. In order to generate the strain rate field of the region, we utilize two different approaches. Both of the approaches reveal that the area has a shear-dominated deformation. Furthermore, we design a simple block model to understand better especially the slip on the Tuz G\u00f6l\u00fc Fault. The results indicate that the fault behaviour can be explained by right-lateral strike-slip motion. This is in contradiction with the previous interpretations of it displaying normal fault behaviour based on geomorphological observations of limited spatial extent. On the other hand, the present-day kinematics of the fault is not an agreement with the thrust features that are observed around it. We think that the propagation of the rupture of the North Anatolian Fault Zone may have put an end to the thrust regime along the Tuz G\u00f6l\u00fc Fault at the end of Pliocene. We think that this study may provide guidelines for understanding the origin and behaviour of slowly deforming \u2018germanotype\u2019 structures within zones of rapidly deforming \u2018alpinotype\u2019 regions.\n               ","91":"\n                  We present new crustal models of azimuthally anisotropic P-wave velocity, isotropic P-wave velocity (Vp), isotropic S-wave velocity (Vs) and Vp\/Vs ratio for the Salton Trough. High Vp\/Vs ratio is revealed at depths of 2\u20138\u00a0km along the San Andreas Fault, implying the possible presence of fluids. High Vp and high Vp\/Vs ratio (>1.8) structures of the mid-lower crust beneath the Salton Trough possibly reflect the underplated gabbroic rocks as a result of the extension-induced partial melting of the upwelling asthenospheric materials. The fast velocity directions (FVDs) generally correlate with the direction of the maximum horizontal compressive stress except that fault-parallel FVDs are found at main fault traces. However, the FVDs in the Salton Trough show complex features. The northern Slaton Trough basin (the northern Salton Sea basin and Coachella Valley basin) is dominated by NW-SE FVDs, which are possibly due to the active compression happening there. E-W oriented FVDs predominate the upper crust of the southern Salton Trough basin (the southern Salton Sea basin and Imperial Valley basin), possibly due to faulting and\/or block rotation. As the depth increases (12\u201318\u00a0km), the FVDs to the south of the Salton Sea have an overall rotation and gradually become NW-SE. The depth-dependent variation of anisotropy orientation may be attributed to a large band of underlying heat source that probably causes a change of stress field by imposing thermal stress on overlying rocks. In all, our velocity models suggest that faults in the Salton Trough may bear a high risk of mechanical failures due to the complexities of stress distribution and geological structures as well as the presence of a large volume of fluids and heat.\n               ","92":"\n                  The fact that the same fault may host different rupture or slip modes was partly attributed to the change in strain rate of the fault in previous studies. However, contradictory observations were obtained in the previous experimental studies, that is, the loading rate can promote or inhibit the rapid instability of faults. Although the two opposite effects of the loading rate were separately explained in the previous studies, the contradiction remains unresolved. Based on an experiment conducted on a granodiorite sample, we use the cumulative fault slip to quantitatively describe the slip-driven changes in fault properties and study the cross-effects of loading rate and cumulative fault slip on the pre-seismic rupture speed, unstable slip rate, and friction coefficient drop of the laboratory earthquakes (stick-slip events). The experimental results show that under the same loading rate, the exponential propagating rupture speed, the unstable slip rate, and the friction coefficient drop of the stick-slip events increase with increasing cumulative fault slip. As a result, the loading rate has opposite effects on the exponential propagating rupture speed, the unstable slip rate, and the friction coefficient drop under different amounts of the cumulative fault slip. This provides an explanation for the observation contradiction that the loading rate can promote or inhibit the rapid instability of the fault. The experimental results also reveal that the steady rupture speed is approximately proportional to the loading rate but weakly depends on the cumulative fault slip.

The active collision has undergone a progressive migration of the Taiwan mountain belt from the northeast to the southwest direction. After the relaxation of the compressional stress due to the westward subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate, the northern Taiwan orogen has collapsed together with the opening of the southern Okinawa Trough. Here, we show the transitional process from compressional to extensional regime in the area off northern Taiwan and reconstruct the tectono-sedimentary evolution by using multi-channel reflection seismic data. We process and interpret multi-channel seismic profiles and use borehole data to determine the ages of sedimentary units and stratal surfaces\/unconformities. Based on the seismic facies, we have recognized two distinctive domains separated by the Offshore Shanjiao Fault (OSF): a shelf basin to the northwest and a collapsed zone to the southeast. The tectono-sedimentary evolution off northern Taiwan since the late Miocene can be described in 4 stages.

(3) During the transition from compressional to extensional regime at about 2.7\u00a0Ma, a post-collisional erosion and subsidence occurred in the collapsed zone to form the basal unconformity. This post-collisional collapse is associated with the opening of the southern Okinawa Trough, a back-arc basin, due to the westward migration of the Philippine Sea Plate subduction beneath the southern Ryukyu arc.

The borehole reveals that the Quaternary thickness in the Huayuan is upto 571.3\u00a0m, which is the thickest Quaternary so far. With the Longmen Shan piedmont wedging into the Sichuan basin, and under the intense erosion of Minjiang river, structure wedges of different scales are formed and result in salient and recess, which corresponds to the geometry of the Quaternary in the Chengdu plain.

The sensitivity of model parameters and physical conditions associated with the basic characteristics of mantle convection, such as internal heating ratio, viscosity stratification, and temperature-dependent viscosity of the mantle as well as viscoplastic rheology that causes plate-like surface motion, on the intraplate stress regimes were studied. The results demonstrated that the radial viscosity structure of the mantle interior strongly affected intraplate stress regimes, and the combination of increased viscosity in the lower mantle and the low-viscosity asthenosphere enhanced the pure strike-slip faulting regime in the stable part of plate interiors. The temporally averaged toroidal-poloidal ratio (T\/P ratio) at the top surface of mantle convection with surface plate-like motion and the mantle's viscosity stratification generally ranged ~20\u201340%, which is comparable to the observed T\/P ratio of present-day and past Earth. Under such Earth-like surface conditions, normal faulting regime with strike-slip component or strike-slip regime with normal faulting component, as well as pure strike-slip faulting regime, were broadly found in the stable parts of the plate interiors. From the definition of the stress regime in the present study, strike-slip faults on the real Earth are likely to occur where the strike-slip faulting component is dominant in the present models.

These findings contribute to understanding the tectonic evolution of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, and provide insights into the geological structure of the East China Sea and formation of the East China Sea Shelf Basin.\n               ","100":"\n                  The Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay form an extinct Palaeogene oceanic spreading system, divided by a major continental transform, the Davis Strait, with the whole region defined as the Northwest Atlantic. The Davis Strait hosts the Ungava Fault Zone and is the central structural element of the Davis Strait Large Igneous Province (DSIP) that formed broadly coeval with continental breakup to its north and south. While constraints on the crustal structure in this region primarily exist in the offshore, crustal models are limited onshore, which makes an interpretation of regional structures as well as the extent, and therefore origin of the DSIP extremely difficult to ascertain. Here, we have collected all available teleseismic data from the Northwest Atlantic margins and applied a receiver function inversion to retrieve station-wise velocity models of the crust and uppermost mantle. We integrate the outcomes with published controlled-source seismic data and regional crustal models to make inferences about the crustal structure and evolution of the Northwest Atlantic. In particular, we focused on constraining the spatial extent and origin of high velocity lower crust (HVLC), and determining whether it is generically related to the Davis Strait Igneous Province, syn-rift exhumed and serpentinised mantle, or pre-existing lower crustal bodies such as metamorphosed lower crust or older serpentinised mantle rocks. The new results allow us to better spatially constrain the DSIP and show the possible spatial extent of igneous-type HVLC across Southwest Greenland, Northwest Greenland and Southeast Baffin Bay. Similarly, we are able to relate some HVLC bodies to possible fossil collision\/subduction zones\/terrane boundaries, and in some instances to exhumed and serpentinised mantle.\n               ","101":"\n                  Comparable to San Andreas fault in western United States, the Tanlu fault zone (TLFZ) is a large-scale continental tectonic belt in eastern China and has played an important role controlling the regional tectonics and earthquake activity in eastern China. It is known there exists an earthquake gap in the southern segment around Suqian, Jiangsu province, where no earthquakes greater than M5.5 occurred. Fine fault zone structure could help to understand the fault activity and the potential earthquake hazards. However, only regional scale velocity model is available in this region, making it difficult to characterize detailed fault structures. In this study, we obtained local Vs model in the upper crust in this region by ambient noise tomography with a dense seismic array. For the Suqian segment, Cretaceous brittle normal faulting controlled the development of the eastern and western graben as well as the central horst between them. The graben-boundary faults are known simply as F1-F4 from east to west, and the NNE-striking fault F5 is between F1 and F2. The eastern boundary fault F1 and western boundary fault F4 separated by about 30\u00a0km are associated with intermittent high velocity anomalies in the shallow crust and are inactive. In comparison, faults F2, F5 and F3 are mainly associated with low velocity anomalies and are relatively active. These high velocity anomalies are very likely caused by the upwelling magma migrated along faults F1 and F4 in the crust, which on freezing could weld the fault zone and make it less active. Because faults F1 and F4 are hindered to move, the deformation could be transferred to nearby faults F2, F3 and F5. Our study sheds light on what controls fault activities along the TLFZ by obtaining local velocity structure in the Suqian segment.\n               ","102":"\n                  To take advantage of complementary strengths of earthquake body wave data and surface wave data from both earthquake and ambient noise sources, we have jointly used them to determine a high-resolution 3D Vs model of the lithosphere in South China by the joint inversion algorithm of Zhang et al. (2014). For body wave data, we assembled P- and S-wave arrival times for 40,028 earthquakes during the period of 2008\/10\u20132018\/06 recorded by 676 stations in South China. For surface wave dispersion dataset, it includes Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps at periods of 8\u201370\u00a0s and group velocity maps at periods of 8\u201350\u00a0s from Shen et al. (2016). Due to the complementary strengths of the two data types, the resolution of the jointly inverted Vs model has improved compared to the separately inverted models. The joint inversion model can also fit both data types at a similar level compared to separate inversions. In comparison with previous models, the new velocity model better delineates the sedimentary basins in the shallow crust and high velocity root in the lithosphere beneath the Sichuan basin, as well as better resolves the velocity variations between western and eastern Yangtze craton, thin lithosphere beneath eastern Yangtze craton and Cathaysia block, and helps us to better understand the mechanism of the lithosphere thinning. From the correlation between high velocity anomalies in the middle crust and the distribution of Neoproterozoic basalt samples, we propose the amalgamation suture between the Yangtze craton and Cathaysia block is along the eastern segment of the Jiangshan-Shaoxing fault and the west margin of the Jiangnan orogen volcanic rocks. Our new joint inversion model is useful for constructing a community velocity model and for better understanding the complex tectonics of the South China block.\n               ","103":"\n                  Recent studies of anthropogenic seismicity have improved our understanding of the causal relationships between earthquakes and industrial activity. Whether larger-magnitude earthquakes can be triggered and how human injection and production of fluids interact with active faults remain poorly understood. The 2017 Mw 6.5 Leyte earthquake nucleated at a depth close to the production zone and within 2\u00a0km of an actively producing geothermal field in Philippines. Here we use satellite radar data to constrain the pre-earthquake ground deformation across the field and the Leyte fault and to determine the coseismic source parameters. From consideration of regional historical seismicity and fluid extraction model constrained by fluid injection and extraction rates, we find evidence suggesting that the mainshock is directly associated with the geothermal production efforts. Our findings demonstrate that the extraction of geothermal power close to active fault zones is capable of triggering damaging earthquakes, a hazard that was previously underappreciated\n               ","104":"\n                  Brittle deformation at high strain rates results in intense fragmentation and rock pulverisation. For rocks, the critical strain rate at which this behaviour occurs is ~102\u00a0s\u22121. The mechanical properties of rocks at these strain rates can also be very different from their quasi-static properties. Deformation of rocks at these strain rates can occur during fault rupture, landslide events, and meteorite impacts. In this study, we present the results of high strain rate mechanical tests to determine the characteristic strain rate for rate-dependent brittle failure, and the fragment size and shape distributions that result from failure at these conditions. We investigated sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble and considered whether the fragment characteristics can be used as diagnostic indicators of loading conditions during brittle failure. We find that the characteristic strain rates, where the dynamic strength is twice the quasi-static strength, range between ~150 and 300\u00a0s\u22121 for rate-dependent brittle failure in the investigated lithologies. Furthermore, we use our results to demonstrate an empirical inverse power-law relationship between fragment size and strain rate for dynamic failure under uniaxial compression. On the other hand, we show that fragment shape is independent of strain rate under dynamic uniaxial loading.\n               ","105":"\n                  Historically, devastating major earthquakes have occurred frequently in the peripheral zones of the Ordos Block. Thus, identifying possible locations of future catastrophic earthquakes in these regions is urgent both in the scientific community and in the public. For this purpose, we at first compute strain rates by means of GPS vectors and b-value from seismicity, then obtain geodetic earthquake potential. The calculation results show that high strain rates are mainly distributed in the peripheral zones of the Ordos Block with very small deformation in the interior of the Block, in good agreement with geology and seismicity. Based on seismic potential, considering historical and modern seismicity, and neotectonic structures together, we conclude that the west end of the Weihe Graben, southwest corner of the Ordos, is the most likely earthquake-prone area in future. Secondary risk regions for future strong earthquakes are located on the intersection between the Haiyuan fault and Liupanshan fault in the eastern Tibet, in the Yinchuan Graben and southwest of Hohhot around the Ordos Block. Therefore, this work may be significant for predicting earthquake risk and assessment of seismic hazard.\n               ","106":"\n                  Integrated structural\/geochronological studies help unraveling complex brittle deformation histories. We have analysed the structural geological database of brittle faults from the ONKALO\u2122 underground facility for spent nuclear fuel in Olkiluoto in southwestern Finland. Based on the structural geological data from eleven representative fault zones, we classify the Olkiluoto brittle structural features into four fault systems, referred to as Fault system I to IV. The classification is based on their structural properties and tectonic history, crosscutting relationships, fault rock mineralogical characterization and 3D modelling. Some constraints on the timing of faulting are provided by K-Ar dates on synkinematic illite from fault gouge samples. Our results show that the bedrock in southwestern Finland experienced numerous brittle deformation phases between ca. 1.75 and 0.9\u00a0Ga. N-S strike-slip faults (Fault systems I and II) formed at mid-crustal levels ca. 1.79\u20131.75\u00a0Ga ago in response to NW-SE\/NNW-SSE compression soon after the Svecofennian orogeny. Later E-W striking oblique dextral\/normal faults (Fault system III) are tentatively associated with the Gothian orogeny 1.6\u00a0Ga ago. These three fault systems were reactivated during NE-SW compression ca. 1.3\u20131.2\u00a0Ga ago, coeval with intrusion of a regional swarm of olivine diabase sills. E-W compression at the onset of the Sveconorwegian orogeny ca. 1.1\u20131.0\u00a0Ga ago resulted in the formation of SE dipping low-angle thrust faults (Fault system IV) and the selective reactivation of fault system II and III. Overall E-W extension during the collapse of the Sveconorwegian orogen ca. 0.97\u20130.87\u00a0Ga ago caused the localised reactivation of fault systems III and IV. Our research approach, which is integral to the siting process of repositories for spent nuclear fuel, demonstrates that the basement in southwestern Finland experienced repeated reactivation since the Mesoproterozoic, suggesting that future deformation localization is likely to be also accommodated by reactivation of existing brittle structures rather than formation of new faults.\n               ","107":"\n                  The seismicity in the north-eastern fringe of the Indian Plate in the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (Tidding-Tuting Suture) and adjoining areas have been studied by analyzing the earthquake data recorded by the local broadband seismograph network as well as reviewed catalog data of the International Seismological Center. The study reveals that the region is seismically active up to ~40\u00a0km depth. In contrast, the seismicity in the Indo-Burma Ranges (IBR) is observed up to a depth of ~200\u00a0km suggesting the active subduction process of the Indian plate beneath the IBR. This study suggests that the subduction process terminates north of ~270\u00a0N Latitude and the indentation process of the rigid Indian plate into south-east Asia predominantly controls the seismicity north of the IBR. The seismicity and its linkage with the existing tectonic features are critically examined in the Lohit Valley and Mishmi Hills regions. Source mechanisms of 10 earthquakes (3.5\u00a0\u2264\u00a0M\u00a0\u2264\u00a04.2) are evaluated with the help of the waveform inversion technique. The results of the source mechanism study reveal that the closely spaced Mishmi, Tidding, and Lohit faults are steeply dipping thrust sheets that accommodate the large crustal shortening owing to the indentation process and clockwise rotation tectonics. The Walong fault is characterized by strike-slip motion which helps to facilitate the clock-wise rotation of crustal material around the syntaxis. Significant strain partitioning is anticipated from the variation of pressure (P) axes orientations indicating the effect of complex syntaxial tectonics.\n               ","108":"\n                  The Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ) is the largest strike-slip system in East Asia. The central TLFZ has four main branch faults across a width of 20\u2013\u00a040\u00a0km, and both the great 1668 Tancheng Earthquake (M8.5) and the Anqiu Earthquake (M7.0) occurred on its two eastern branch faults. Due to the lack of recent earthquakes and stations around a seismic-quiescent segment of the TLFZ centered near the 70\u00a0BCE Anqiu Earthquake, previous tomographic images have resolutions coarser than 20\u00a0km in the middle and lower crust, unable to show how the crust is faulted along the TLFZ. To improve the resolution, we deployed a 70-km-long W-E-trending seismic array with 38 portable seismographs across the TLFZ at 36.1\u00b0N. Using one month of teleseismic records and a newly developed multiscale teleseismic tomography method, our P-wave velocity profile has achieved a resolution of 5\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0km in shallow crust, and 10\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0km in deep crust, as shown by the resolution tests. The profile's velocity variation correlates well with surface geology and crustal electrical resistivity profiles. The new profile provides clues for the depth distribution of major TLFZ branches, and indicates the two eastern TLFZ branch faults cut through the crust along a column-shaped low-velocity anomaly. This low-velocity column is associated with low-resistivity anomalies in the upper and lower crust, indicating a likely presence of fluids in the faulted rocks. This crustal faulting interpretation is consistent with the Moho geometry of previous receiver function studies, with an alignment between a receiver function Moho dome and a large low-velocity anomaly. Though seismicity is sparse near the profile, our interpreted crust-cutting location is in line with a linear cluster of recent TLFZ earthquakes about 20\u00a0km south of the profile, indicating that this quiescent segment could be a 150\u00a0km seismic gap along the central TLFZ.\n               ","109":"\n                  Convergent plate dehydration is of significance in determining the coupling strength and seismicity activity at variable subduction contacts. Characterized by decadal M\u00a0>\u00a07.5 devastating earthquakes offshore and a lack of a magmatic arc in north-central Peru, the Peruvian megathrust remains enigmatic in terms of the along-strike heterogeneity of the thermal regime, slab dehydration, and seismotectonics. Hydrothermally controlled petrological metamorphism of multiple facies within the subducted oceanic lithosphere and subsequent fluid channeling and migration lead to fault instability and seismic and aseismic slips on the megathrusts. Based on 3D thermal modeling, we estimate the features of the Peruvian subduction hydrothermal regime. Our results show that (1) the shallow seismogenic zone (M\u00a0>\u00a07.5 earthquakes) along coastal Peru exhibits high slab dehydration rates and gradients and is associated with fault segmentation and the updip migration of fluids controlling the occurrence of great megathrust earthquakes; (2) the low slab dehydration rate (<0.01\u00a0wt%\/km) in north Peru contributes to the absent volcanism in north Peru, while the high slab dehydration rate (>0.02\u00a0wt%\/km) beneath south Peru facilitate the recurrence of magmatic volcanism; (3) the subduction-related slip behaviors at a certain depth resulting from heterogeneous variations in the coupled plate interface are determined by slab dehydration and petrological metamorphism in the subducted Nazca plate. The variation in slab dehydration contributes to the seismotectonic segmentation and slip variation associated with changes in the pore fluid pressure on the subducted megathrust.\n               ","110":"\n                  We applied a 2-dimensional, non-spectral technique to investigate the spatial variations of the lithospheric effective elastic thickness (T\n                     \n                        e\n                     ) in the eastern Bayan Har block and its adjacent areas.

Currently, it is not well understood how\/if strain from the LLLF is transmitted to the JQHF over geologic time scales and how seismically active the eastern section of the LLLF is. Recent studies indicate that the 1927 M8 Gulang earthquake ruptured the middle LLLF and propagated eastward onto the eastern LLLF instead of propagating onto the JQHF. To assess if this concurrent rupture of middle and eastern LLLF is (or might be) a common phenomenon, we measured the Holocene slip-rate at the Huoshaotai site, east of the LLLF \u2013 JQHF junction, to compare it with known rates from the middle LLLF. Using displaced geomorphic markers and radiocarbon dating, we determined a Holocene left-lateral slip-rate of 6.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0mm\/a for the eastern LLLF. This rate is only slightly below the consensus slip-rate for the middle LLLF (6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0mm\/a; 6.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0mm\/a), suggesting a gradual strain transfer and similar seismic activity for both sections. Paleoseismic evidence further suggests that at least three preceding earthquakes may have ruptured both sections simultaneously during the Holocene, indicating that concurrent failure of both sections, as in 1927, may not be uncommon. Concurrent failure of middle LLLF and JQHF is however not reported. Hence, it appears that LLLF and JQHF act as independent seismo-tectonic entities, without substantial strain transfer or concurrent seismic activity.

Exploring its thermo-tectonic history is important to reconstruct the intra-continental evolution of the Tianshan belt. In this contribution, we report new apatite fission track (AFT) data from the basement rocks from the northern (i.e. the Wenquan complex) and southern (i.e. the Dahalajunshan - Nalati range) margins of the Yili block. Thermal history modeling reveals that the Wenquan complex underwent moderate basement cooling in the Cretaceous, possibly due to far-field effects of the Tethys-deformation and the following Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. These events at the southern Eurasian margin propagated tectonic stress to the northern Yili and triggered localized deformation. Early Triassic-middle Jurassic moderate cooling is also identified in the Dahalajunshan - Nalati range, and is interpreted to be related to the post-orogenic strike-slip motion along the major shear zones and the effects of the Qiangtang and Kunlun-Qaidam collision. Combined with the published thermochronological data, it is suggested that the northern and southern parts of the Yili block experienced different Mesozoic thermo-tectonic evolution. Basement cooling of the northern Yili block generally took place before the Cretaceous, exhuming shallower crustal levels as compared with the southern one. The intermontane Yili basin may have accommodated substantial propagated contraction induced by the Cretaceous collisional events. Based on our new results and the previously published thermochronological data, it is suggested that the intra-continental reactivation of the North Tianshan and Nalati faults probably did not invoke significant regional exhumation during the Meso-Cenozoic.

However, two well-layered ultramylonites are characterized by bimodal CPOs of (010)[001] (B type) and (001)[100] (E type) or a strong maximum of [010] normal to the foliation and girdle patterns of both [100] and [001] on the foliation plane (i.e., an axial [010] pattern or AG type). Moreover, spinel grains within these well-layered ultramylonites have not only been broken down to form olivine and amphibole by hydrous reactions, but have also been fractured and their fragments pulled apart in the fine-grained matrix. These features indicate that shear deformation occurred as increasing stress under hydrous conditions during the final stage of deformation, which enabled the local occurrence of low-temperature plastic deformation, resulting in the development of a CPO and a foliation within the ultramylonites.\n               ","117":"\n                  A dense seismological array and profile reveal the deep structure across the Longmenshan from the Songpan-Ganzi terrane of the Tibetan plateau to the Sichuan basin. Receiver function and tomographic images reveal that the Pengguan Complex which cores the Longmenshan in the region where the Ms. 8 Wenchuan earthquake of 2008 occurred, is marked by high velocities in the upper 15\u00a0km of the crust. At about 15\u00a0km depth both P- and S-wave velocities decrease at a flat-lying boundary around which the aftershock hypocentres of the Wenchuan earthquake are concentrated. Thus, this boundary may be a faulted interface or detachment, marking the base of the Pengguan Complex. Moho depths change significantly in going from the Tibetan plateau to the Sichuan basin. At the location of the dense profile a Moho step occurs, located about 50\u00a0km NW of the surface trace of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (YBF). The boundary at about 15\u00a0km depth below the Pengguan Complex seems to deepen at around the Wenchuan-Maoxian fault (WMF) by about 3\u00a0km and merge to the NW with another interface at about 18\u00a0km depth. This interface, NW of the WMF, which correlates with the top of a zone of high conductivity is interpreted to represent the top of the Tibetan mid-crustal low velocity, high conductivity zone. The tomographic image indicates that the boundary between the low velocities of the Songpan-Ganzi terrane and the high velocities of the Sichuan basin in the middle and lower crust occurs NW of the surface trace of the YBF. Thus, it is proposed that a zone extending from the WMF at about 15\u00a0km depth to the Moho step about 25\u00a0km further NW marks the boundary between the Tibetan plateau and the Sichuan basin in the middle and lower crust.\n               ","118":"\n                  Transform continental margins play a major role in plate tectonics. In the last 10\u00a0years' petroleum exploration has moved to the hunt of stratigraphic traps in the passive margin sequence of continent-ocean transforms. The result has been a drastic increase in modern deep seismic data and more well calibrations. Considered as one of the longest continental transform plate boundaries, the Davie transform system (East of Africa) is one of the best places to investigate the evolution of a major transform linking two oceanic basins. Based on a new basement and structural maps and schematic cross-sections, our findings show that the Davie Fracture Zone (DFZ) is made of several transform segments with two main trending directions related to the plate scale kinematic reorganization occurring at ca. 155\u00a0Ma. The early proto-segments trend NW-SE in the oldest oceanic domain and are broadly in the same trend that onshore major faults and lineaments implying African structural inheritance. The second set of transform segments trends N-S and the most important corresponds to a plate boundary between the Mozambique Basin and the Madagascar margin. Results further show that the DFZ offers great variability of transpressional and transtensional structures and vertical displacements along its different segments from the onset of the transform activity until today. These main phases of inversion are also interpreted as a consequence of plate scale kinematic reorganizations. The DFZ is thus an excellent marker to follow the long-term evolution of plates tectonics, but also the short-term as attesting the presence of Neogene to present magmatic centers and active faults along the Mozambique coastline.\n               ","119":"\n                  Ubiquitous wet cracks in fault damage zones alter the mechanical behavior of fault rocks. Quantifying the effects of crack damage and water on stress evolution is fundamental for earthquake rupture model establishment. We conducted increasing-amplitude cyclic loading experiments on dry and wet sandstones to investigate the effects of crack damage, confining pressure and water on the stress rotation and fault weakening. The energy dissipated in each loading-unloading cycle was quantified for inference of the evolution of crack damage within the fault zone. A multi-layer elastic model was used to investigate the effects of crack damage and water on stress rotation in the fault damage zone. The results show that the observed decrease of elastic modulus in both dry and wet rocks greatly increased the maximum principal stress in the fault core as deformation progressed, but reduced the differential stress and the angle between the maximum principal stress and the orientation of the fault damage zone. However, water within fault rocks results in a lower reduction in differential stress within the fault damage zone when compared to the dry condition. The observed decrease of differential stress implies that the stress state evolves away from failure, and we infer water affects the proximity to fault instability both by affecting the stress rotation and by reducing in local strength, where these two effects are in competition. These results and inferences indicate that the stress rotation amplitude of fault damage zone increased with the crack damage, demonstrating that the stress rotation is greater near the damage zone-core interface than that near the fault damage zone\/host rock boundary. We also found that the changes in the elastic modulus of the deformed rocks remains almost the same under different confining pressures, indicating that stress rotation of fault damage zone is not affected by confining pressure.\n               ","120":"\n                  The Bohai Sea is proposed as the center of deformation associated with destruction of the North China Craton, and its tectonic history is essential for understanding the response of craton evolution to oceanic subduction. However, interior deformation of the craton remains unclear due to a lack of high-resolution imaging in this region. Here, we present high-resolution 3-D azimuthally-anisotropic shear-wave velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle using direct inversion of Rayleigh-wave phase-velocity dispersion from ambient noise. The anisotropic velocity structures reveal significant consistency between the regional strain field and seismic activity in the shallow crust. The N-S fast direction and relatively high velocity anomalies observed in the uppermost mantle beneath the Tanlu fault zone, as well as prominent Moho uplift, support the conclusion that the Tanlu fault zone has facilitated lithospheric modification of the eastern North China Craton since late Mesozoic. Anisotropy images also indicate that the northern and southern Bohai Bay Basin have undergone different deformation histories. The strong and consistent azimuthal anisotropy within the uppermost mantle beneath the southern Bohai Bay Basin may originate primarily from re-orientation arrangement of the olivine induced by new lithosphere formed from rapid cooling of upwelling asthenosphere after lithosphere delamination due to the subduction of the (Paleo-) Pacific Plate.\n               ","121":"\n                  Underground gas storage is one of the solutions required for reducing CO2 emissions and ensure the transition to a renewable power supply. The Hontom\u00edn pilot-plant in N-Spain is a well-studied CO2 facility located in the Burgalesa Platform, a fold belt in the Southern Basque-Cantabrian Basin. Previous works agree that crustal extension and evaporite migration controlled the subsidence in the area. The discrepancies lie in the salt expulsion models proposed during syn-rift and post-rift stages and the basin deformation during Cenozoic contraction. The models range from thin-skinned tectonics, basement-involved thrusting, strike-slip faulting, and interference between thick- and thin-skinned thrusting with lateral extrusion. There is multiple working hypothesis often with contradictory predictions of the underground structure. Understanding these structural styles is critical for identify the main salt structures suitable for gas storage in the Burgalesa Platform. We integrate multidisciplinary data from 2D seismic to wellbore, gravity and field data, allowing us to construct three restored cross-sections that illustrate the process of progradational loading and salt expulsion towards the SW during the Early Cretaceous, which led to the development of the Hontom\u00edn and other trap structures within the salt overburden. Differential loading occurred diachronously along strike during the Cenozoic, younging to the SE by evacuation of the remaining salt, which caused diapirism and salt welding. We found that most of the structures in the cover were formed by salt migration, whereas Cenozoic shortening caused the rejuvenation of salt-structures and local diapir squeezing. Shortening in the basement is consumed in the frontal thrust that overrides the Duero foreland and in the partial reactivation of the former Mesozoic transfer faults as transpressional faults. The results of this work have implications for a further understanding of the tectonic evolution of the external area of rift structures, and as tectonic analogues in other salt-bearing basins.\n               ","122":"\n                  The Kalabagh Fault Zone in the western Sub-Himalayas is a dextral strike slip fault zone that exhibits a push-up block in the stepover zone of the two fault segments. The inception of the push-up block occurred along the restraining faults that form two morphotectonic bends along the mountain front at Zaluch and in the South of Thathi. The landform was further developed by en-echelon fold and thrust sequence up to Khairabad in the North and Ghundi village in the South. The aseismically moving fault zone has experienced earthquakes during late Quaternary forming surface expressions in the West of the push-up block at Khairabad, Larkakki and Ghundi. The Khairabad and Ghundi sections are the active tectonic fronts of the stepover zone. Displacements caused by these seismic activities has deformed Quaternary sediments creating stream deflections, surface ruptures, pressure ridges, uplifted sediments at the mountain front, foreland ridges and uplifted alluvial fan. Offsets in the late Quaternary sediments indicate the Kalabagh Fault is active and seismic events of Mw\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 has formed these ground effects. Furthermore, stratigraphic correlations of fluvial sediments indicate the Indus River has been flowing in the NS direction along the northern segment of the Kalabagh Fault. Uplift of the push-up block in the Kalabagh Fault Zone and subsequent deposition of the alluvial fans has caused westward diversion of the Indus River.\n               ","123":"\n                  The Demerara and Guinea plateaus are conjugate Transform Marginal Plateaus (TMPs) formed at the junction of the Jurassic Central Atlantic Ocean and the Cretaceous Equatorial Atlantic Ocean. We compare their structure and evolution through a combined industrial\/academic seismic dataset tied by well data. We show that these TMPs record a complete evolution history from the Jurassic Central Atlantic to the Equatorial Atlantic breakup and seafloor spreading phases. Both plateaus first formed as volcanic margins displaying successive SDR wedges migrating towards the newly forming Central Atlantic domain. In this context, Demerara and Guinea, conjugates of the Bahamas, seem to have formed in relation to plume activity at the southern end of the Central Atlantic domain. Our dataset suggests that the Demerara and Guinea plateaus initially represented two distinct extrusive centres separated by a crustal basement high. Later, during the Cretaceous Equatorial opening phase, both plateaus separated in a transform mode following this discontinuity. Deformation is notably asymmetric during this phase: Aptian to Albian folding, strike-slip, transtensive deformation and complex vertical movements on the Demerara side and only minor deformation on the Guinean side, except on its divergent Sierra Leone termination. The deformation is sealed on both plateaus by a regional upper Albian erosion unconformity. Extensional reactivation occurs on the Guinea side (probably through a general collapse?).

Monitoring changes in seismicity pattern along this zone plays a role in understanding the process before and after major earthquakes. For this purpose, stress-dependent laws in statistical seismology can be used: the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size law and the Omori-Utsu aftershock-decay law. We review the results obtained by using these laws in previous studies to show a zone of high stress near the eventual epicenters of the M6.5 and M7.3 earthquakes before the start of the Kumamoto sequence, and after it, showing a decreasing trend in stress along the Futagawa-Hinagu fault zone. Detailed analysis suggests aseismic slips along the causative fault zone. The aseismic preslip locally reduced stress just prior to the M7.3 earthquake near its epicenter. Recently, a system was proposed by Gulia and Wiemer (2019) that utilizes the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size law to judge, immediately after a large earthquake, whether it was the mainshock or a foreshock to a future event. Based on the reviewed results and our new results, further research that takes into account the spatial variation of frequency-size distribution, allowing the exploration of the possibility of a local preslip of a future nearby earthquake, is needed to improve this system.\n               ","125":"\n                  Continental rifts are the expression of regional horizontal stretching and are in modelling studies often assumed to be the result of orthogonal or oblique extension. However, naturally occurring V-shaped rift geometries infer an underlying rotational component, resulting in a divergence velocity gradient. Here we use such analogue models of rifting in rotational settings to investigate and quantify the effect of such a divergence velocity gradient on normal fault growth and rift propagation towards a rotation pole. Particularly, we apply different divergence velocities and use different brittle-ductile ratios to simulate different crustal configurations and analyse its effect on rift propagation and surface deformation. Surface deformation is captured using stereoscopic 3D Digital Image Correlation, which allows for quantifying topographic evolution and surface displacement including vertical displacement. In combination with X-Ray computed tomography, we gain insights into the three-dimensional structures in our two-layer models. Based on our models, we present a novel characterisation of normal fault growth under rotational extension which is described by 1) an early stage of bidirectional stepwise growth in length by fault linkage with pulses of high growth rates followed by a longer and continuous stage of unidirectional linear fault growth; 2) segmented rifting activity which promotes strain partitioning among competing conjugate faults and 3) along-strike segmented migration of active faulting from boundary faults inwards to intra-rift faults allowing different fault generations to be simultaneously active over the entire rift length. For models with higher divergence velocities, inward migration is delayed but other first-order observations are similar to models with lower divergence velocities. Our quantitative analysis provides insights on spatiotemporal fault growth and rift propagation in analogue models of rotational rifting. Although natural rifts present complex systems, our models may contribute to a better understanding of natural rift evolution with a rotational component.\n               ","126":"\n                  Knowledge of the crustal stress state is important for understanding tectonic processes and seismic hazard assessment as well as for various practical applications. In this study, we present a model describing the contemporary 3D crustal background stress field of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The model incorporates a complex fault system and an appropriate initial stress state that matches both model-independent stress observations and kinematic data well. Our results show that the modeled maximum horizontal stress SH is generally oriented in NW-SE direction. The Bayan Har Block and the Chuan-Dian Block are dominated by a strike-slip faulting stress regime. However, in some local areas, the crust is governed by a normal faulting regime. We infer that the local normal faulting stress regime in the Bamei-Kangding area is caused by the clockwise rotation of the strike of the Xianshuihe fault at Kangding. This normal faulting stress regime would promote the ascent of intrusions and provide the space necessary for the emplacement of the Zheduoshan granite. The stress state on the Longmen Shan fault zone is rather inhomogeneous. For the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault, the northeastern segment has a lower normal stress but a higher shear stress than the southwestern segment. This inhomogeneous stress state on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault could provide an explanation for the northeastward propagation of the ultra-long unilateral rupture in the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake. According to the stress state on the Xianshuihe fault, we conclude that the Kangding-Shimian segment has a high potential to produce a strong earthquake due to its high normal stress and a fast slip rate and should be carefully monitored. On the Bamei-Kangding segment, which is governed by a normal faulting stress regime and may be lubricated by fluids, slip seems to be facilitated favoring more frequent small to moderate magnitude earthquakes to occur on this segment.\n               ","127":"\n                  The Macolod Corridor (MC) is a NE-SW trending zone of Quaternary volcanism which perpendicularly bisects the Luzon Arc. This peculiar zone of volcanism is in a junction of different tectonic elements. This led to several models of formation associated with subduction or crustal extension-related processes. New information about its subsurface structure can provide constraints in resolving outstanding questions on its tectonic development. However, elucidating the origin and deep structure of the MC has been problematic due to the extensive young volcanic deposits that blanket the area. In this study, ground magnetic and aeromagnetic datasets are merged to characterize the magnetic signature in the MC. Short wavelength and high amplitude anomalies suggest complex interactions of magnetic bodies within the region. Edge detection techniques reveal linear magnetic anomalies with NE-SW, NW-SE, and E-W trends in the Corridor. These may indicate rift structures at depth. Analytic signals show maximum amplitudes over volcanic centers suggesting maximum magnetic property contrasts due to deep structural controls. Euler solutions cluster in the NE-SW, NW-SE, and E-W trends. These may correspond to conjugate structures at depth suggesting the primary role of the NW-SE shearing between the bounding Philippine Fault and the Sibuyan Verde Passage Fault. Clustering of solutions in a graben-like pattern is also observed beneath volcanic complexes indicating an extensional regime. The MC is also characterized by a shallow magnetic basement as reflected in the Curie point depths. This may be attributed to high heat flow associated with active volcanism and probably crustal thinning. These results skew our interpretation to a rift-related origin of the MC. Thus, it is interpreted to be the manifestation of the continuum of tectonic processes including near-field influences (shearing between the two bounding faults) and far-field influences (arc-continent collision and resulting northwestward translation of the Philippine Mobile Belt).\n               ","128":"\n                  Available data suggest that the breakup of the Neoarchean Kenorland supercontinent at 2.5\u20132.4\u00a0Ga was likely triggered by a large mantle plume upwelling that caused significant magmatism. Here, we present 2D high-resolution magmatic-thermomechanical numerical models of extension of the continental crust underplated by a hot mantle plume material. Using this model, it is demonstrated that mantle plume underplating generates a large amount of mafic melt by decompression melting. This melt penetrates into the extending continental crust along normal faults thereby forming multiple generations of mafic dyke-like intrusions along normal faults. In case of extension velocity of 0.2\u20131\u00a0cm\/yr, lower crustal heating and hot mafic melt emplacement may cause partial melting of the continental crust that can generate significant volume of felsic melts. This in turn triggers emplacement of felsic intrusions that temporarily and spatially associate with the mafic dyke-like intrusions. The modeling results agree well with geological data from the Karelian Craton and provide possible explanation for the observed association of Paleoproterozoic mafic dykes and felsic intrusions which formed in a relatively short time interval (up to 20\u00a0Myrs) in the early stages of the supercontinent breakup.\n               ","129":"\n                  The Bahla massif exposes the lower crustal section of the Oman ophiolite located close to the thrust front of the Semail nappe. It is affected by intense faulting previously attributed to tectonic events that dismembered a classical ophiolitic sequence during or after the obduction. Here we show that most of this complexity is primary, inherited from syn-accretion tectonics. The crustal section is exposed in a 15 by 8\u00a0km tectonic enclave surrounded by mantle peridotite. Its northern boundary corresponds to a major, steeply dipping normal fault striking WNW-ESE, at low angle to the paleo-ridge axis. Movement along this fault was accommodated by intense plastic deformation of the crustal cumulates and adjacent mantle peridotites at temperature conditions \u2265900\u00a0\u00b0C. The thickness of the deformed zone reaches several hundred meters. The flattening of the cumulate layering away from the fault is correlated to a decrease in the deformation intensity. Undeformed olivine-gabbro dykes cross-cut this \u201ctectonic Moho\u201d indicating that the tilting occurred before the end of the igneous activity. To the southwest, the crustal enclave is bounded by a NW-SE trending transtentional shear zone that was active in the amphibolite to greenschist facies and was intensely injected by syn- to post-kinematic gabbronorite and tonalite\/trondhjemite dykes and plugs. The age of one felsic sample (95.214\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.032\u00a0Ma, high-precision UPb zircon dating) is within error of the age of intrusive felsic intrusions into the mantle and lowermost axial crust from the length of the Oman ophiolite, which slightly post-dates the mean crystallization age of the Semail crust (V1 magmatism; 96.1\u201395.6\u00a0Ma). Other contacts are low temperature features including cataclastic faults, serpentine\u2011carbonate breccias and flat-lying d\u00e9collements.\n                  Parent melts of the Bahla crustal cumulates were more siliceous and hydrous, i.e. more andesitic, than typical mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) as deduced from the frequent occurrence of early crystallizing orthopyroxene (opx) and late crystallizing amphibole. Some facies such as cumulate harzburgite and opx-troctolite have not been documented elsewhere in the Oman ophiolite and may be specific to the tectonic context in which the frontal massifs accreted. The chemical composition of the lower crustal cumulates can be accounted for by the hybridization in various proportions between MORB and a primitive andesite from a depleted source whose origin can be looked for in melts from a nascent subduction zone or from high temperature hydrothermal processes.\n                  The structure of the Bahla lower crustal section is reminiscent of the plutonic growth faults documented along present-day slow-spreading centres in both mid-ocean ridge and back arc settings. The distinctive characteristics of the Moho and lower crustal section in the Bahla massif are tentatively related to their position at the leading edge of the ophiolite, i.e. closer to the Arabian continental margin at the time of accretion than the massifs from the internal part of the ophiolite that have a more continuous and less deformed lower crust. It indicates that the style of crustal accretion may have changed during the opening of the oceanic basin from which the Oman ophiolite issued.\n               ","130":"\n                  We study the Mw 5.6 Bystraya earthquake, occurred on September 21, 2020 at the SW flank of the Baikal rift zone in the area, in which only few small seismic events have been detected during the whole period of instrumental observations. Source parameters of the mainshock and its largest aftershock (Mw 4.7) are inverted from intermediate-period surface wave amplitude spectra. Hypocentral depths and seismic moment tensors in a double-couple approximation are calculated for both earthquakes, while integral source characteristics, describing its spatio-temporal development, are estimated only for the mainshock. For the Bystraya earthquake, directivity effects (rupture direction and velocity) are also modelled. The obtained results show that the study seismic event can be associated with activation of the SE segment of the Main Sayan fault. The faults of the mainshock and its largest aftershock are formed under the influence of the NW-SE extension and NE-SW compression. The predominance of left-lateral strike-slip motions agrees well with previous studies at the SW flank of the Baikal rift zone. A small thrust-fault component could reflect the inversion uplift of some blocks of the Bystraya basin bottom as well as the Bystrinskaya Sopka massif. The dipping of the earthquake fault plane could indicate flattening of the considered fault segment at some depth or the existence of differently oriented structural discontinuities inside the fault zone of a finite width. The long rupture of the Bystraya earthquake could be connected with its almost pure strike-slip focal mechanism and orientation of the rupture plane approximately along the Main Sayan fault strike.\n               ","131":"\n                  Constraining the shortening rate, timing, and deformation pattern in the frontal parts of the southern Qilian Shan (China) is helpful to further understand the strain distribution model and the tectonic deformation mechanism of the Qilian Shan.

It has experienced the structural evolution and interactions between itself and surrounding areas throughout the Late Cenozoic. Based on the geological and geomorphic mapping, landform profile surveys, and seismic line interpretations, the Santai anticline is considered to be a fault-propagation fold that is controlled by basement-involved faulting and limb rotation. In the late Quaternary, the shortening rate of the Santai anticline was almost 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0mm\/a, accounting for about 8% of the crustal shortening across Qilian Shan, and with the assumption of a constant shortening rate, latest rapid deformation occurred at about 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma.

Several anticlines in the Lenghu and Eboliang structural belts are generally characterized by double fault systems at different structural levels. At shallower crustal levels, a thrust fault system dominates and at lower levels positive flower structures accommodate oblique shortening, and these are mainly separated by weak strata layers in the Upper Xiaganchaigou Formation, of late Eocene age. Left-step en echelon distributed normal faults and trailing extensional imbricate fan structures consistently demonstrate that the Lenghu and Eboliang structural belts are dominated by dextral transpressional deformation. The western part of the NE Qaidam Basin experienced an initial stage of extension in the Jurassic, which was associated with the formation of several NW-striking normal faults. We hypothesize that most of the deep compressional structures and shallow anticlines were formed due to the SW-directed thrusting of the Qilian Shan since the early Eocene, as a far-field effect of the Indo-Asian \u201chard\u201d collision. The NNE-directed shortening was associated with dextral transpressional deformation within the western part of the NE Qaidam Basin that took place after the deposition of the Shangyoushashan Formation, of middle-late Miocene age.

We carried out novel paleoseismological analyses at four sites of three different fault segments, and reviewed the data of the previous results for three other segments. We carried out several topographic profiles across the offset hillslopes, alluvial fans, glacial cirques, moraines, and valley floor. Through the dozen radiocarbon datings that were combined and cross-checked with many other ages published in previous studies, we have provided robust slip-rates and reconstructed the Holocene seismic history of this fault system. Paleoseismic analyses revealed the presence of three consecutive earthquakes since the onset of the Late Holocene, which were separated by 3.3 ky and 2.2 ky, respectively.

Given the length of this fault system, we estimated Mw 7 for its entire rupture, which accounts for the total destruction of L'Aquila and the neighboring villages. This also accounts for the strong effects and severe damage suffered by several settlements in the para-Tyrrhenian far field, especially to buildings characterized by long fundamental resonance periods, as seen for the monuments of Rome.\n                  Although characterized by long recurrence times (2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 ky), our results suggest that as for all of the main silent faults of the eastern set of active structures in the central Apennines, this fault system has one of the largest seismogenic potentials of the whole Apennine chain, with seismic risk implications extended even to its far-field.\n               ","134":"\n                  The Gulf of G\u00f6kova is one of the earthquake-prone areas in the Aegean Sea and southwestern Turkey.

In this study, we reveal that the shores of the Gulf of G\u00f6kova have been uplifting since the Pleistocene and Holocene, with a high probability of large magnitude offshore earthquakes occurring on normal faults very close to the modern shoreline.\n               ","135":"\n                  The NE-trending Liaodong Bay Subbasin (LDBS), a subunit of the Bohai Bay Basin (BBB), developed along the Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ) in eastern China. The LDBS is controlled by both extensional and dextral strike-slip fault systems and has an episodic evolutionary history, leading to a poor understanding of its tectonic origin. In this paper, through interpretations of seismic data and other geological and geophysical data, four best-fit finite element models were generated to reveal the tectonic development of the LDBS and the whole BBB. The deformation features predicted by the modelling results are consistent with the geological evidence. The modelling results revealed that the extension directions of the LDBS changed from WNW-ESE during the Paleocene-early Eocene, to NW-SE during the middle-late Eocene and then to NWN-SES or nearly N-S in the Oligocene and Miocene. The changes in the extension direction resulted in a strike-slip transition of the TLFZ in approximately the middle-late Eocene, from normal to dextral transtensional, and transformed the LDBS and the whole BBB from an extensional basin into a dextral transtensional basin. This transformation was likely triggered by the kinematic adjustment of the Pacific Plate from NNW to WNW in the middle-late Eocene, but was maintained and enhanced by the Indian-Asian collision during the rest of the Cenozoic.\n               ","136":"","137":"","138":"","139":"","140":"\n                  The tectonic plate under the eastern Mediterranean Sea shows a remarkable variability as it comprises Earth's oldest oceanic lithosphere as well as the transition towards continental lithosphere beneath the Levant Basin.

Here, we combine a large, new surface wave dataset with published wide-angle data in order to determine lithospheric properties in the eastern Mediterranean.

S-velocity tomography based on surface wave data also shows thick, spatially variable oceanic mantle lithosphere beneath the eastern Mediterranean. Thickness of the oceanic lithosphere increases eastwards from the Triassic Ionian towards the Permo-Carboniferous lithosphere in the Central Eastern Mediterranean. These results demonstrate that oceanic lithosphere can thicken by cooling substantially beyond the limits suggested by the plate cooling model. Beneath the eastern Herodotus oceanic Basin, lithospheric thickness is decreasing to about 180\u00a0km. Thin continental lithosphere and shallow asthenosphere are present beneath the Dead Sea Fault, demonstrating that the localization of the lithospheric deformation and crustal seismicity along the fault correlates spatially with the thinning of the underlying continental lithosphere.\n               ","141":"\n                  Satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been playing an important role in the earthquake surface deformation observation and source model inversions with its advantage of fine spatial resolution in comparison with seismological data. At present, the two-step inversion approach, including a nonlinear inversion step for determining the fault geometry (e.g., length, width, depth, strike, dip, rake, slip) and a linear inversion step for estimating the slip distribution, is widely used to obtain seismic source parameters from satellite InSAR data. However, the nonlinear inversion step has some weaknesses, such as a prior knowledge requirement, local minima solution, complex and time-consuming. Coseismic differential interferogram is input into back propagation neural network (BPNN) to perform real time inversion of fault geometry in the previous study. But due to the simpleness of network structure, rake and slip parameters is fixed and inversion accuracy is limited. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach of Earthquake Source Parameters Inversion using ResNet (abbreviated as ESPI-ResNet) from satellite InSAR data. ESPI-ResNet is able to firstly classify the 4 fault types and then invert the 7 fault geometry parameters based on uniform slip model. We train our model by firstly creating a large dataset of simulated interferograms with source parameters ranges confined by seismological and geological data. The accuracy of fault type classification is 99.6% and root mean squared error (RMSE) of inversed fault geometry parameters is low in the simulated test dataset. To find most suitable model for seismic source parameters inversion, we further compare the inversed accuracy of different networks, including BPNN, VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50 and DenseNet. We find that moderate increase of network depth and the use of convolution, deep residual learning can improve the model's performance for source parameters inversion, and therefore ResNet-34 is chosen as the backbone network in this study. Finally, real differential interferograms of Yutian earthquake (2020 Mw 6.3), Jiuzhaigou earthquake (2017 Mw 6.5) and Menyuan earthquake (2016 Mw 5.9) are used to validate the proposed method. Real earthquakes validation shows all of them have correct fault type classification, and the inverted results are consistent with the current seismic source parameters data.\n               ","142":"\n                  The timing and mechanism of the changes in the stress\/strain field direction on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau are controversial, which limits our understanding of the tectonic evolution of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and the Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF). Here, we conducted a detailed anisotropy of low-field magnetic susceptibility analysis of successive fluvial-lacustrine sediments deposited since the early Oligocene at Eboliang in the middle-western Qaidam Basin. Magnetic fabrics of the upper part (the Qigequan Formation) are predominantly considered to be primary sedimentary magnetic fabrics, while those of the lower-middle parts (the Shangganchaigou to Shizigou Formations) are mainly pre-folding, layer-parallel shortening induced embryonic tectonic fabrics. The magnetic lineation revealed ~50\u00b0 successive clockwise rotations of the compressional strain orientations from nearly N-S to NE-SW in the middle-western Qaidam Basin during ~15\u20137\u00a0Ma. The nearly N-S compressional event is consistent with the generally N-S-directed India-Asia collision and thus was attributed to its far-field effects, whereas the post-mid-Miocene transition of ~50\u00b0 clockwise rotations of the compressional strain orientations is consistent with the tectonic deformation in the basin interior. This transition lagged far behind that in the northern Qaidam marginal thrust belt (NQMTB), which began in the early Oligocene. The laterally diachronous transition in compressional strain orientation and deformations in the middle-western and northern Qaidam Basin were most likely due to the two-stage, sinistral strike-slip faulting of the ATF, with confined sinistral shear occurring along the ATF and partially transferred into the NQMTB during the early Oligocene to middle Miocene, while distributed sinistral shear occurred on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau beginning in the middle Miocene. A bidirectional propagation of compressional strain variation and tectonic deformation from the northern Qaidam Basin since the early Oligocene is proposed to reflect the tectonic evolution of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.\n               ","143":"\n                  Tectonic stresses governed by the Arabia \u2013 Central Iran collision are transferred throughout the Iranian Plateau. The orientation of the maximum horizontal stress (\u03c31) significantly changes (~90\u00b0) in the Persian block of NW Iran. However, the exact spatial extent and boundary conditions for these changes are poorly defined. This study investigates the late Cenozoic stress regime in a key region in NW Iran including the Mahneshan \u2013 Mianeh Cenozoic Basin (MMCB), the Garmachay Fault Zone (GFZ), and the southern flank of the Bozqush Mountains (SBM). We mapped folds and fault zones in detail using high-resolution satellite imageries and field surveys. We have measured fault-slip data at 49 localities distributed over the study area. The results of fault-slip inversion analysis indicate significant temporal and spatial changes in both the modern and paleostress fields. In the MMCB and GFZ, the orientation of the horizontal \u03c31 axis changed from N148\u00b0E to N041\u00b0E, during the Pliocene and Quaternary times. During the same period of time, it changes from NE-SW to N138\u00b0E in the SBM. Our study reveals that the southern boundary of the Persian block corresponds to the deep-seated North Tabriz fault (NTF), which is spread out over several splays at the southern flank of the Bozqush Mountains. The NTF acts as a boundary condition in both the stress and strain fields of the region. The GFZ defines the southeastern border of the Persian block, where the NW-trending maximum compression encounters the remote stress field in the hinterland of the Zagros collision. Our results indicate that independent movements of crustal blocks transfer crustal stresses beyond the collision zone and produce large-scale stress perturbations by discarding compatibility in regional strain\/stress fields.\n               ","144":"\n                  The Great Sumatran Fault (GSF) 1900\u00a0km long active and segmented strike-slip faults.

Knowing the geometry of subsurface structures in this segment is one of the efforts to identify potential disasters in the future. To achieve this objective, ground magnetic measurements were carried out and the data were combined with Bouguer anomaly map. Magnetic susceptibility and density were also measured on hand samples collected during the survey so that their values could serve as initial parameters for modeling. The modeling and interpretation stages are carried out through joint forward modeling magnetics and gravity. The equivalent depth of the magnetic and gravity models built under the surface is 20\u00a0km. The magnetic and gravity modeling identify several intrusive bodies that do not reach the surface, including one beneath Lake Singkarak. Several slivers of Permian metamorphic rocks encased in the basement rocks were also identified. These unexposed intrusive bodies and slivers of encased metamorphic rocks are probably quite common in the GSF. The magnetic and gravity modeling with 2D modeling also infers an 18\u00a0km displacement in Lake Singkarak based on displacement of Quaternary colluvium volcanic deposits.

We conducted geophysical surveys in the Talala seismogenic region to investigate the structure of the causative fault, with two Time-Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) profile measurements, and Magnetotelluric (MT) measurements across the fracture zone to characterize deeper structures. TDEM measurements in the E-W direction revealed an electrically conductive zone within highly resistive surroundings, and the MT measurements revealed high electrical resistance along a curved structure that correlates with the seismogenic area and is likely associated with fractured crystalline rock. These fracture systems or networks can act as conduits for channeling and focusing intense rainfall events and develop significant fluid over-pressures to drive the swarm sequences. Numerical modelling results of fluid pressure evolution indicate increased groundwater and reservoir levels are likely responsible for earthquake generation.\n               ","146":"\n                  The subsidence\/uplift patterns of forearc basins are controlled by subduction dynamics and are strongly dependent on the nature of the margin (erosive vs. accretionary). Here, we explore the role that increased megathrust shear force plays in triggering and sustaining the short wavelength topography of coastal forearc regions at erosive margins, where subsidence is supposed to prevail. The northern Colombian coastal forearc contains a\u00a0~\u00a01000\u00a0m-high mountain range (Baud\u00f3 Range) that abruptly stands-up for ~300\u00a0km along the northwestern Pacific margin of South America, where the buoyant Nazca plate is subducting at a shallow angle. Field observations and stratigraphic data of Cretaceous to late Neogene volcanic and sedimentary rocks, suggest that the Baud\u00f3 Range has been uplifting since the middle-late Miocene. The uplift seems to continue nowadays as evidenced by the irregular cliffed and bluffed coastline, steep slopes and high topographic ruggedness in one of the wettest regions on Earth, where weathering and landscape smoothing is expected to be intense. Earthquake focal mechanisms, together with regional-scale N-S-trending sinistral reverse fault structures, west-verging folding, and NW- and NE-oriented topographic lineaments, seems to be related to a trench-perpendicular mostly compressional stress regime. The residual topography along the coastal range of the northern Colombian forearc indicates under-compensation, which may suggest that the relatively thin (~20\u00a0km-thick) crust cannot support isostatically the observed topography. We propose that increased shear force along a wide seismogenic zone linked to the shallow subduction of the Nazca plate and a poorly lubricated interface, due to limited sediment dispersal into the trench, drive the ongoing topographic uplift of the region. In contrast, the smoother relief and lower elevations in the southern Pacific coast of Colombia could be explained by a deficit of shear force available to support higher topography.\n               ","147":"\n                  At the Decatur carbon capture and storage site (IL, USA) CO2 has been injected from 2011\u20132014 and from 2017 to present near the base of the Lower Mt. Simon Sandstone saline reservoir, resulting in microseismicity. Microseismicity is mainly located in the basement and distributed in distinct spatial clusters. The lack of significant impedance contrasts within the basement makes the interpretation of active-source seismic reflection data challenging, however, recent reprocessing allowed to resolve faults above and at the top of the basement. These faults generally do not coincide with the location of microseismic events and their continuation to the general depth of the seismic events cannot be assumed. This paper shows how the interpretation of the microseismicity can complement structural interpretations of active-source seismic reflection data. In particular, we analyze clusters and bursts (abrupt increases) of microseismicity, identify unresolved, smaller-scale weaknesses and extract statistical parameters. These parameters allow comparisons with the interpreted faults, and with fracture sets intercepted by boreholes. During injection at the Decatur site, the injection pressure was kept far below fracture pressure, nevertheless, seismic events were induced and spread far beyond the expected extent of the CO2 plume. We argue that local stress transfers related to the CO2 injection reactivated pre-existing fractures within the critically stressed basement. Finally, we conducted a slip tendency analysis for faults interpreted from active seismic, selected cluster, bursts and nodal planes from focal mechanisms to determine if the interpreted structures are optimally oriented with respect to the stress regime. Our results suggest that the orientation of fractures close to the injection well, generally shows slight deviations from the optimal orientation for slip. This might indicate either slight local deviations of the maximum horizontal stress azimuth from the average direction used in the analysis, or the lack of optimally oriented fractures at this location.\n               ","148":"\n                  Multiphase cave conduit offset and related speleothem damage in the Dem\u00e4nov\u00e1 Cave System (DCS; the Low Tatra Mts, Central Western Carpathians) were dated with U-series methods, revealing five events: (1) 570 (442)\u2013417\u00a0ka, (2) 306\u2013291\u00a0ka, (3) 184\u2013130\u00a0ka, (4) ~19\u00a0ka, and (5) 2.56\u20132.3\u00a0ka. To decipher the cause of the damage, we combined geochronological data with structural, geomorphological, and seismological research. Gravity sliding as a probable source of damage is unlikely since the Dem\u00e4nov\u00e1 Valley has deepened only to a small extent for the past 550\u00a0ka and the steep fissure guiding the studied parts of the DCS extends below the recent valley. However, coseismic block sliding cannot be unambiguously excluded, as Newmark displacement analysis revealed that any >M7 earthquake in the 25\u00a0km range could have produced a 10-cm pseudostatic displacement. The studied offsets were accompanied by shaking, as inferred from fallen stalagmites and stalactites; hence, distant earthquakes are plausible damage sources. We applied ground-motion models and compared them with seismicity and scant prehistoric and historical data to identify and quantify the probable seismic source, which is most likely the Sub-Tatric Fault located 17.5\u00a0km from the cave. As inferred from the applied ground-motion models, a\u00a0>\u00a0M7 event on the Sub-Tatric Fault would generate a PGA >4\u00a0m\/s2 in the cave despite the attenuation, which is above the threshold horizontal ground acceleration forcing the majority of speleothems to break.\n                  Although the mechanism that leads to cave passage offsets remains unclear we consider them as an off-fault damage caused by secondary faulting related to postseismic surface vertical movements, or less likely but not out of the realm of possibility distributed rupturing.\n               ","149":"\n                  An unusual earthquake doublet ruptured the high-risk middle segment of the Xianshuihe fault in November 2014, exhibiting significant variations in the rupture and aftershock characteristics.

The first event ruptured upward along the dip and bilaterally along the strike with the duration of 8.0\u00a0s, whereas the second event ruptured mainly around the hypocenter with the duration of 3.5\u00a0s.

The further analysis of rupture model-based static and dynamic stress change suggests that the first event is likely responsible for triggering the second event. Based on the comprehensive analysis of aftershock migration features, we find complex and diverse driving mechanisms of aftershocks. Aftershocks of the first event of the earthquake doublet were likely driven by afterslip. Early aftershocks of the second event were also likely driven by afterslip; however, later aftershocks were likely driven by fluid diffusion.

In order to obtain a quantitative picture of the continuous slip rate along and slip partitioning between the faults, we establish a comprehensive 3D geomechanical-numerical model of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results show that the NW-SE-trending faults usually slip faster than the faults striking in NE-SW direction. A substantial variation of the slip rate gradient along the Xianshuihe fault is revealed. The southeastern segment (Moxi fault) has a higher slip rate gradient than the northwestern segment, which is inferred to be caused by a clockwise rotation of the strike of the Xianshuihe fault from NW-SE to NNW-SSE near Kangding. This rotation combined with the accommodated southeastward movement of the Chuan-Dian Block further promotes normal faulting on the southwestern-most section of the Longmen Shan fault. According to the relatively higher slip rate of the Huya fault and the geometric distortion of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault, we suggest that the Huya fault may have penetrated into the Longmen Shan fault zone and partially transmitted deformation of the Minshan Uplift into the sedimentary cover of the Sichuan basin. Based on the analysis of contemporary kinematics in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, we suggest that the Moxi fault has a high seismic hazard with the potential of an Ms7.4 earthquake, while the northeastern segment and the southwestern-most section of the Longmen Shan fault zone tend to produce more frequent but lower magnitude earthquakes.\n               ","151":"\n                  The Dead Sea pull-apart basin (DSB), which is located within the Dead Sea Transform fault system, displays tectonic asymmetry between its eastern and western longitudinal zones.

The analysis indicates that the seismicity along the western longitudinal zone is deeper than the eastern one. Focal mechanism analysis indicates that about 50% of solutions are strike-slip, compatible with the plate motions along the Dead Sea transform. Comparison between the two longitudinal zones of the basin shows that the focal mechanisms in the eastern DSB are dominated by strike-slip faulting shallower than 12\u00a0km depth, whereas those in the western DSB are dominated by oblique faulting below 12\u00a0km depth.

The horizontal maximum compression (\u03c3Hmax) trends NNW-SSE, with increasing value of the vertical stress component along the western part of the basin, corresponds to the oblique faulting in this zone. The optimal friction coefficient determined by the stress-inversion for the fault planes is \u03bc\u00a0~\u00a00.5.

The failure stress exceeds that predicted by the Coulomb failure criterion, inversely proportional to the size of the perturbation zone and the criticality of the tectonic stress on the fault, but proportional to stressing rate. The size and spatial distribution of perturbation relative to the velocity weakening zone strongly impact rupture timing, location, and size. Broadly distributed pressurization can lead to rupture well before reaching the reference failure stress without perturbation. When the perturbation stress is applied at a critically stressed fault or segment, the rupture runs away beyond the perturbation zone. Conversely, the rupture is self-arrested and limited within the perturbation zone. If the fault contains multiple segments, diversified rupture patterns, in addition to normal earthquakes, doublet events, and slow slips, are sometimes observed, even in the velocity-weakening zones.\n               ","153":"\n                  The reactivation mechanisms of coseismic surface ruptures associated with the 2011 Mw 6.7 Fukushima-ken Hamadori earthquake in Japan are investigated using in-situ controlled hydraulic injections in subsurface boreholes. Two fault segments were selected for reactivation studies, one across a coseismic rupture, the Shionohira site, and one across a non-coseismically ruptured segment, the Minakami-kita site. A series of water injections in sealed sections of boreholes set across the fault progressively bring the fault to rupture by a step-by-step decrease of the effective normal stress clamping the fault. While the fault is rupturing during these hydraulic stimulations, borehole displacements, fluid pressure and injection flowrate are continuously monitored. Then, the tests were analyzed using fully coupled hydromechanical modeling. The model was calibrated on field data, and a parametric study was conducted to examine the modes of fault reactivation. Coseismic surface rupture of the Shionohira fault showed a pure dilatant slip response to hydraulic tests, while the tectonically un-activated Itozawa fault (South) indicated a complex hybrid response to tests related to both a higher frictional and cohesive strengths of the fault. The analysis of the induced Shionohira slip event showed that it is reasonably modeled as a Coulomb rupture with an eventual dependency of friction on slip velocity, in good accordance with laboratory-derived rate-and-state friction data on the Shinohira gouge samples. In contrast, the Itozawa fault reactivation mechanism appears dominated by tensile failure with limited Coulomb shear failure. Thus, the applied protocol proves to be able to isolate significant differences in fault physical properties and rupture mechanisms between two segments of the same fault system, opening perspectives to better assess near-surface rupture effects, and therefore the safety of structures such as dams or nuclear waste repositories subject to large earthquakes.\n               ","154":"\n                  This work studies salt-detached fold-and-thrust belts involving minibasins by means of physical analogue modeling. The experimental set up consist of a series of minibasins and diapirs built by downbuilding into a regular polygonal framework. The minibasins-diapir framework were then submitted to contraction, and for some examples accompanied by different rates of syncontractional sedimentation. We aimed at evaluating the influence of an initial salt basin geometry (i.e. equal thickness vs. along-strike tapered) on the development of the salt-sediment system, and how this influences the geometries and kinematics of fold-and-thrust belts. We also tested how these are influenced by different syncontractional sedimentation rates. Results show that major differences on the early salt structures occur during downbuilding as a result of original salt budget (i.e. from pillows to diapirs), with a positive correlation between amount of original salt and salt structure development. Initial contractional deformation is localized on the weaker salt bodies, favoring salt extrusion. Shortening is then transferred forwards once vertical salt feeders are welded (i.e. secondary welds), while basal (primary) welds are sheared, rolled or delaminated. Changes on structural styles occur abruptly along-strike as controlled by degree of development of the precontractional salt structures. Relatively low syncontractional sedimentation rate delays forward propagation of deformation and promotes minibasins tilting. With larger sedimentation rates, a thicker cover inhibits minibasins deformation and secondary welding and, promotes a more coherent mechanical beam detached on the basal weld. Our modeling is compared to natural fold-and-thrust belts such as the Zagros and the European Alps.\n               ","155":"\n                  The Mt. Gorzano Fault (MGF) is a major seismically active extensional fault of the central Apennines, responsible for the destructive Mw 6.0 Amatrice earthquake in 2016. The MGF developed during post-orogenic extensional tectonics, generating a continental basin in the hanging wall. The age of the onset of the MGF and the relationship among faulting, fluid circulation, and the seismic cycles are unknown. We investigate these issues by studying the footwall damage zone of the MGF (exhumed from ~2-3\u00a0km depth), where extensional structures and related mineralizations cut and partially overprint the pre-existing compressional orogenic fabric. Structural and geochemical analyses (REE, O, C and clumped isotopes) combined with U-Pb dating of calcite mineralizations show that extensional deformation along the MGF began at least ~2.5 Myr ago. Its activity has continued to the present-day with a mean slip rate of ~0.9\u00a0mm\/yr, consistent with other seismically active extensional faults of the central Apennines. During Apennine contractional tectonics, orogenic structures and tectonic overburden hindered the ascent of deep fluids, which, therefore, may have been progressively overpressured. We postulate that such overpressure occasionally or cyclically triggered impulsive deformation (earthquakes). During the subsequent extensional phase (younger ~2.5\u00a0Ma), pre- or co-seismic crustal dilation opened pathways for the ascent of deep mineralizing fluids, which impregnated the fault damage zone and may have triggered earthquakes.

As an alternative, a combination of records from seismometers at regional distances and appropriate processing methods can yield location and depth estimates that are useful because they provide extensive data. We illustrate this with a study of magnitude of the seismicity in the 4\u20135\u00b0N Mid-Atlantic Ridge using data from seismometers in Brazil, Cape Verdes, and Africa coast.

We compare the seismicity with features using bathymetric data collected with a multibeam sonars, which reveal two detachment fault surfaces (\u201cmegamullions\u201d), one close to the modern rift valley floor but offset by ~10\u00a0km from it. The located seismicity is shallow (best estimate less than 8\u00a0km below seafloor). The swarms occurred over two segments of the ridge and, in the 2016 case, clearly involved movements on widely distributed multiple faults, including faults on both sides of the valley. Although the methods used produce epicenters and hypocenters with uncertainties that are still larger than those of OBS experiments, they could provide a way to study whether seismicity is systematically deep in certain parts of the ridge where megamullions are observed.\n               ","157":"\n                  We carried out new geological, morphotectonic, geophysical and paleoseismological investigations on the Meduno Thrust that belongs to the Pliocene-Quaternary front of the eastern Southern Alps in Friuli (NE Italy). The study area is located in the Carnic Prealps, where a series of alluvial terraces, linked to both climatic and tectonic pulses characterises the lower reach of the Meduna Valley. In correspondence of the oblique ramp of the Meduno Thrust, the Late Pleistocene Rivalunga terrace shows a set of scarps perpendicular to the Meduno valley, often modified by human activity. In order to reconstruct the tectonic setting of the area and identify the location for digging paleoseismological trenches, integrated geophysical investigations including electrical resistivity tomography, seismic refraction and reflection, ground penetrating radar and surface wave analyses (HVSR, ReMi and MASW), were carried out across the scarps of the Rivalunga terrace. Geophysical surveys pinpointed that in correspondence of the oblique ramp, stress is accommodated by a transpressive thrust system involving all the seismo-stratigraphic horizons apart from the ploughed soil. Trenching illustrated the Meduno Thrust movements during Late Pleistocene-Holocene. Trenches exhibited both shear planes and extrados fracturing, showing deformed alluvial and colluvial units. 14C datings of the colluvial units show that the most recent fault movements occurred after 1360\u00a0CE and 1670\u00a0CE. The age of the deformed stratigraphic units compared with the earthquakes listed in current catalogues, suggests that the 1776 earthquake (Mw 5.8, Io\u00a0=\u00a08\u20139 MCS) could represent the last seismic event linked to the Meduno thrust activity.

In samples collected near the highest vertical surface offset, two types of amorphous materials were found in the high-strain shear zone: 1) material formed by creeping during the inter-seismic period, which is characterized by ground sandstone clasts; and 2) coseismic material, characterized by the comminution of the sandstone clasts of the former type. Interaction of amorphous material with fluids during creeping resulted in Fe-rich nano-sized grains in the pores, Mg- and Al-rich stratified zones near the pores, amorphous silica next to the stratified zones, as well as new clay minerals in the stratified zones. Feldspar and phyllosilicates were transformed into clay minerals and amorphous silica.

This area also exhibits a complicated relationship between crustal extension and magmatism. We present the tomographic inversion of seismic P-wave and S-wave velocity models, as well as the Vp\/Vs ratio model, in order to delineate the crustal extension and post-rift magmatic features. The velocity structure is created by forward modelling (RayInvr) and travel-time tomographic inversion (Tomo2D). The results suggest that Mesozoic strata near the Dongsha area has a maximum thickness of ~4.6\u00a0km with a Vp of 3.5\u20135.5\u00a0km\/s, a Vs of 1.9\u20133.1\u00a0km\/s, and Vp\/Vs ratios of 1.71\u20131.76, indicating a low porosity and high degree of diagenesis.

The crustal anomalies with high Vp\/Vs ratios of 1.80\u20131.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 are identified, which are the product of post-rift magmatic intrusions. The seaward increase in continental lower crustal Vp\/Vs ratios, suggests an increasing level of mafic intrusion into the continental crust. We attributed crustal hyperextension to increasing fault density, which caused intense magmatic intrusion and thinner HVLC beneath the continent-ocean transition (COT).\n               ","160":"\n                  Crustal extension mechanisms control rifted margin formation. During these extensional processes, the crust stretches and thins following both non-uniform and non-symmetric patterns. The modeling of main features of these processes is a relevant issue, as well as its quantification by the calculation of the stretching-thinning factors along the margins. This work presents a computational procedure for reproducing the crustal extension process due to Andersonian faulting and estimating the evolution of its extension-thinning factors. This procedure uses an algorithm based on geological hypotheses, geodynamic analysis results and kinematic relationships. The algorithm applies pure-shear extension, where stretching and thinning are based on Andersonian faulting formation. It is supposed to be applied in two-layer (upper\/lower) crust configurations in two ways: a) including a new active fault; b) reactivating a previously activated fault. Kinematic relationships consider area conservation for the upper crust. The first step is the application of a crustal extension increment. This increment activates the faulting by simple shear in the upper crust and induces plastic distributed pure-shear deformation in the lower crust. This double effect generates a local thinning of both upper and lower crusts. Slip-in-fault also occurs as part of the thinning deformation. Additionally, a geodynamic analysis was carried out with an in-house developed system, based on the Finite Element Method. Coupled with advanced constitutive models, this approach is useful to reproduce stress-strain-temperature evolution during the crustal extension. Geodynamic analysis guided the definition of some improved kinematic relationships for the proposed procedure: a variable thinning zone, nonlinear thinning configurations, a variable slip\/extension ratio, a shoulder uplift and out-of-section fault pivot. The procedure was applied to reproduce part of a crustal stretch of a hyper extended margin due to Andersonian faulting, estimating its thinning and extension factors. The results show that this procedure is able to qualitatively reproduce crustal extensional configurations.\n               ","161":"\n                  The Tianshan belt forms the southwestern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, and its current topography is a product of punctuated Meso-Cenozoic intra-continental deformation that is still active today. This study provides new apatite fission track data on the Paleozoic rocks in and adjacent to the Chinese Central Tianshan, including two age-elevation profiles in the Alagou and Gangou areas. Inverse thermal history modelling reveals that the Central Tianshan experienced regional slow to moderate cooling during most of the Mesozoic, and that the present-day topography was mainly built by Cenozoic uplift and erosion. Geomorphological observation reveals several fragments of flat, low-relief surfaces within the Central Tianshan, which were likely to have formed in the Mesozoic as evidenced by thermal history modelling of the Alagou age-elevation profile. Furthermore, our data suggest that the Chinese Central Tianshan and its adjacent terranes did not undergo intensive relief building during its long-term Mesozoic evolution, as several pre-Mesozoic deep-rooted regional faults did not record evidence for a strong Mesozoic reactivation. Finally, differential exhumation in the Western Chinese Tianshan and Junggar is discussed, and we propose that the development of regional brittle faults could significantly influence the processes of intra-continental deformation.\n               ","162":"\n                  We investigate the effects of far-field stresses and major crustal boundary faults in the deviation of local stresses around the Lut Block of the southeastern Iranian plateau in the light of the 2010\u20132011 Rigan earthquakes. Dextral 2010 (Mw 6.5) and sinistral 2011 (Mw 6.2) Rigan earthquakes occurred in the southern edge of the Lut Block, where there is no report of moderate to large magnitude historical and instrumental seismicity. To address the style and distribution pattern of local stresses, we apply the inversion method to focal mechanism solutions of 74 earthquake events (1933\u20132018, Mw\u00a0\u2265\u00a04.8).

Moving toward the Rigan area, the results indicate a gradual deflection in the direction of the horizontal \u03c31 axis along the East Lut fault system (i.e., from north to south, Dasht-e-Bayaz: N044\u00b0E, East Lut: N051\u00b0E, Kahurak: N066\u00b0E, Rigan: N077\u00b0E), while it reveals a sharp change along the West Lut fault system (i.e., from north to south, Tabas: N044\u00b0E, West Lut \u2013 Kuhbanan: N010\u201313\u00b0E, Shahdad \u2013 Bam: N013\u201326\u00b0E, Rigan: N077\u00b0E). The deviation in the long-lasting strike-slip\/transpressional stress regimes along the eastern and western boundaries of the Lut Block is mainly controlled by the geometry and kinematics of the East Lut fault system, and the direction of the Arabia \u2013 Eurasia convergence, respectively. The geodynamic interaction of the East and West Lut fault systems which bound the crustal block on both sides has a significant effect on the evolution of local stresses in the southern edge of the Lut Block, which is bounded by second-order faults that are the termination of the major faults. The results may apply to other crustal blocks limited in some boundaries by the second-order splays of crustal faults with different geodynamic implications.\n               ","163":"\n                  At the eastern boundary of the North African Alpine Chain (NAAC), coexisting grabens, thrusts, and strike-slip faults form a complex structural pattern in the general context of Nubia-Eurasia plates convergence. In a context where the root of several major structures is poorly constrained, debates exist on the possible roles of orthogonal to shortening extension, d\u00e9collement layer at the base of the Mesozoic cover, and lithospheric scale processes such as delamination. We present analog modeling experiments of shortening and\/or orthogonal extension applied to an upper-crust consisting of sand lying on weighted silicon. When considered, a second silicon layer mimics a d\u00e9collement at the basement-cover boundary.\n                  Our results highlight: 1) The regional structural pattern results from both crustal shortenings related to convergence between Nubia and Eurasia plates and orthogonal extensions due to a far-field pull of the Western-Hellenic\/Dinaride subduction. 2) Several large-scale structures such as the Zaghouan thrust faults, the Sicilia Channel rift system, and the Gafsa Fault zone root deep into the continental crust. 3) The Atlas Triassic d\u00e9collement layer is responsible for thin-skin tectonics in the Atlassic domain leading to the formation of surface folds called \u201cDjebels\u201d, extension in the \u201cFoss\u00e9s\u201d area, and also favoring underplating of upper-crust slices in northern Tunisia. 4) Misfit on dominating extension direction at the wedge top between model and nature highlights the role of processes at the scale of the lithosphere such as the formation of a crustal root below the Atlassic wedge and opposite vertical motions between Atlas and Pelagian areas as a consequence of lithospheric delamination.\n               ","164":"\n                  The geodynamics and plate tectonics of the South China Sea (SCS)-Taiwan region since Miocene times are uncertain because the former extent and tectonic configuration of the subducted easternmost SCS along the Manila trench is uncertain.

The Manila transcurrent fault initiated ~18\u00a0Ma ago at the onset of the tear and progressively moved eastward, creating the intra-oceanic Luzon arc, which began collision ~7\u00a0Ma ago along the EU margin. From ~7 to 6.5\u00a0Ma Taiwan was uplifted west of the Longitudinal valley. The Luzon arc and forearc basins were shortened within the Coastal range.

A contractional fold belt developed in the basin during the latest Middle to Late Jurassic. Folds are upright, planar, doubly plunging, and lack systematic vergence. Thrust faults are seldom observed. The Ban Don Fold Belt (BDFB) is 350\u202fkm long and 240\u202fkm wide. It forms an arcuate salient towards the foreland to the NW with nearly a 90\u00b0 change in fold trend orientation and an estimated average shortening of 37%. The change in fold orientation follows sedimentary facies boundaries, which parallel the depositional basin margins. The NW-trending BDG basin axis forms a line of symmetry for the facies boundaries and fold trends. An analog for the upright fold-dominated, low-taper wedge of the BDFB is the Parry Islands Fold Belt (salt detachment). However, the absence of salt in the BDFB suggests a very weak detachment was facilitated by high fluid pressures in the basal shales. Deposition and deformation of the BDG plus recently published regional data indicate the well documented Late Jurassic and Cretaceous Andean-type margin of Southeast Asia also existed during the Early and Middle Jurassic. The BDG reflects back-arc deposition with subsequent deformation driven by changes in subduction angle and\/or subduction obliquity during the Jurassic. Alternatively, the arcuate geometry of the BDFB is also compatible with the collision of a small indenter.\n               ","166":"\n                  The southernmost Okinawa Trough back-arc basin is an active and young basin formed just after the collision of the Philippine Sea Plate against the Eurasian continental margin.

To better understand the active tectonics and volcanism of the southernmost Okinawa Trough, we have conducted deep-tow sub-bottom profiler and side-scan sonar surveys across the back-arc basin. Our results show that the volcanism of the southernmost Okinawa Trough is distributed in the southern half of the back-arc basin and occurs along some linear or branched zones roughly parallel to the trough axis. Volcanic seamounts are obviously located along the central depression of the basin and their sizes show lateral variation. On the other hand, the northern half of the southernmost Okinawa Trough back-arc basin has almost no volcanic activity, but contains more brittle normal faults. It is noted that gas plumes out of seafloor are generally associated with hydrothermal mounds or activities, instead of volcanic seamounts. We suggest that the more complete rifting of the southernmost Okinawa Trough back-arc is limited to the east of ~122o30\u2032E. To the west of ~122o30\u2019E, the back-arc extension could be still influenced by the inherited NE-SW trending structures of the continental crust created during the former Taiwan orogeny in this area.\n               ","167":"\n                  The Solonker-Xar Moron-Changchun-Yanji Suture (SXCYS) is regarded as a tectonic boundary between the Central Asian Orogenic Belt and the North China Craton. Formed during the closure of Paleo-Asian Ocean and modified by the subsequent magmatic activities, this suture might have recorded complex processes of accretionary orogeny and crustal recycling. Thus, seismic reflection profiling was conducted along a length of 160\u00a0km from Naiman to Ar Horqin Banner, Inner Mongolia, and the lithospheric structures of central SXCYS have been examined. A prominent feature is a group of strong reflections from the middle crust to the topmost mantle beneath the center of the profile, which consists of massive south dipping reflections and a few middle crustal reflections with a opposite vergence. This group of strong reflections is interpreted to be the subduction relict formed during the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The estimated lateral extent of the suture zone is ca. 100\u00a0km across strike, and its subduction polarity is southward with an apparent dip angle of 15 to 20\u00b0. The upper crust along the whole profile is characterized by weak reflectivity, which also extends to the middle crust. This absence of reflective structures may be attributed to the magmatic activities during or after the continental convergence. Two strong reflection clusters extending from the bottom of upper crust to the lower crust are also identified, which may be caused by distinct magmatic intrusions. Overprinted on the dipping reflections, the Moho is identified at a depth of 33 to 36\u00a0km, which is inferred to be formed at an extensional background contemporary with the subsurface Mesozoic sediments and extensional faults. A detailed model of the evolution processes of the central SXCYS is proposed, which includes the oceanic subduction, the final collision, and the modification by subsequent magmatic activities.\n               ","168":"\n                  We examine the seismicity recorded by two temporary ocean bottom seismometer arrays deployed along the northeastern Manila Trench, covering the outer rise and part of the accretionary wedge.

Most events occurred in the subducting plate, oceanward of the trench, at depths between 25 and 50\u00a0km and revealed normal-fault type mechanisms. The relatively deeper focal depth and the lack of well-developed outer rise bulge near the seismic cluster suggest an untypical pattern of outer rise earthquakes. Seismicity with a high occurrence frequency and small magnitude is typical of earthquakes swarm, which is generally thought to be driven by fluid pressure variations. We suggest the infiltration of seawater through fractures into the rifted South China Sea margin is the main driver of the earthquakes detected during our deployments.

Systematic differences in distribution of the recrystallized grains and grain sizes, indicate deformation at differential stresses from a few tens to hundred MPa. Yet, no evidence of increasing strain towards the contact to amphibole-rich gneisses is observed. In contrast, a decreasing number of recrystallized grains towards the contact occurs locally. In relation to pseudotachylytes, the recrystallized quartz is affected by shear fractures offsetting the recrystallized microstructure. This, and the missing or decreasing strain gradient of dislocation creep towards the contact to amphibole-rich gneisses, indicate that 1) dislocation creep in quartz-rich layers is preceding and 2) not directly related to the high-stress and high strain-rate deformation, ruling out a major influence of thermal runaway for the formation of the pseudotachylytes. The differences in the deformation behavior is interpreted to be controlled by the distance to the propagating fault tip.

The three-dimensional (3-D) inversion method was used to provide a more realistic electrical resistivity model since phase tensor analysis showed 3-D features. The electrical structures along the two profiles showed similar characteristics: lower crustal conductors underlie the upper crustal resistive zone, the resistive zone may correspond to a crystalline basement, and the lower crustal conductors were interpreted as aqueous fluid-related and water-derived partial melting. Earthquakes were distributed mainly in the upper crustal resistive zone but not in the underlying conductive zones, which indicated that fluid migration into the upper crust may have contributed to triggering earthquakes in this area.\n               ","172":"\n                  The 2011 M9 Tohoku-Oki earthquake caused widespread seismicity including that associated with upward fluid migration within the overriding plate. Such fluid-driven earthquake sequences have a peculiar behavior whereby the ruptures of individual small earthquakes propagate in the opposite direction to the direction of pore pressure invasion. This backward rupture propagation is not predicted by the conventional fluid-driven seismicity model that only considers the evolution of pore pressure on the fault, thus ignoring the effect of stress redistribution. Here, we investigated the characteristics of earthquakes under the influence of upward fluid invasion using numerical simulations considering realistic frictional behavior and fault creep. Specifically, we examined the slip behavior of a fault governed by rate-and-state dependent friction when imposing upward pore pressure diffusion. We assumed multiple velocity-weakening patches on an otherwise velocity-strengthening fault. Our results show that the seismicity front can migrate much faster than predicted by the conventional model because of the redistribution of shear stress on the fault. The recurrence of earthquakes and the directions of ruptures are controlled by the brittleness, \u03b2, i.e., the patch size divided by the critical nucleation size. When \u03b2\u00a0>\u00a01, earthquakes repeatedly occur at the same patches, and the swarm activity expands with time. The first rupture at each patch propagates updip, while the directions of subsequent ruptures are variable. When \u03b2\u00a0<\u00a01, earthquakes occur only once in each patch, followed by repeating slow slip events, and the source region migrates rather than expands. In this case, individual earthquake ruptures propagate downdip in the opposite direction to the pore pressure invasion, explaining the observed peculiar rupture characteristic. The consistency obtained between the simulated \u03b2\u00a0<\u00a01 characteristics and the observed ones suggests that the fluid-driven seismicity following the Tohoku-Oki earthquake was only a fraction of the total deformation in which aseismic slips were dominant.\n               ","173":"\n                  The geometry of stepovers along strike-slip faults dictates the deformational field and topography induced around the faults. Stepover geometry also impacts the ability of a fault rupture to propagate from one fault segment to another and therefore acts as a major controlling factor in the size of earthquakes. However, the geometry of stepovers is often poorly resolved, as they tend to underlie young sedimentary successions. Yet, although mostly ignored, the accumulated long-term relative plate motions accommodated by the stepping faults generate permanent rotational deformation in the crust surrounding them. Here we present the results from a combined mechanical and paleomagnetic investigation of the vertical axis rotational pattern confining stepovers. We focus our investigation on the central Dead Sea Fault, where two prominent stepovers are located at the Kinneret and Hula depressions. To better understand their still somewhat elusive geometric settings, we mapped the crustal rotational field by studying the magnetization of the confining volcanic rocks. Remanent magnetization directions reveal localized zones of anomalously high vertical axis rotations in the vicinity of the stepovers that evolve to negligible rotations elsewhere. We then constructed a series of elastic and elasto-plastic slip models aiming to cover possible plate boundary architectures. Comparable patterns between the observed and predicted rotations were achieved when the Dead Sea Fault motion was concentrated along the eastern margins of both the Kinneret and Hula Basins. Our best-fit model suggests that the along-strike under-lapping distance for the Kinneret Stepover is ~8\u202fkm whereas for the Hula Stepover is only ~2\u202fkm. Our results, supported by historic and paleoseismic records that show no evidence of an earthquake that ruptured through the Kinneret Stepover, imply an enhanced deformation zone in the center of Lake Kinneret, which acts as a major barrier to rupture propagation.

The survey was carried out in preparation for the DIVE (Drilling the Ivrea-Verbano zonE) project, which was recently approved by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). DIVE aims to gain new insights into the characteristics of the lower continental crust through targeted drilling, sampling, and borehole logging. A key borehole is planned near the Insubric Line at Balmuccia, where the deepest parts of the lower continental crust are exposed. As such, the primary objective of this seismic survey was to explore whether the sub-vertical structures prevailing at the surface can be expected to continue at depth or whether there are any indications for major flattening or fault-related offsets. Correspondingly, the acquisition and processing of the seismic reflection data were geared towards revealing weak backscattered events from local heterogeneities associated with the prevailing sub-vertical structural grain. The migrated sections, contain coherent backscattered events to a depth of ~1\u00a0km, which form numerous short lineaments that seem to align sub-vertically. To substantiate this observation, we have generated synthetic seismic reflection surveys for canonical models of sub-vertical structures associated with Gaussian- and binary-distributed heterogeneities. Both the observed and synthetic seismic data were then subjected to energy-based attribute analysis as well as geostatistical estimations of the structural aspect ratios and the associated dips. The results of these quantitative interpretation approaches are indicative of the overall consistency between the synthetic and the observed seismic data and, hence, support the original qualitative interpretation of the latter in that the sub-vertical structural grain evident at the surface seems to prevail throughout the imaged part of the upper crust.\n               ","176":"\n                  It is widely recognized that major brittle faults in the upper crust transition downwards into ductile shear zones that then widen with depth. However, the controls on shear zone width at any specific depth, and the mechanisms that may cause the width to change over time, are less well understood. This study therefore reconstructs the geometry and rheology of the crustal-scale, normal-sense Simplon Shear Zone between the depths of ~3 and\u00a0~\u00a026\u00a0km, by combining field- and microstructural mapping, quartz paleopiezometry, and published estimates for the pressure, temperature, and timing of deformation at different crustal levels. The geometry is complex, with multiple strands actively deforming at any one depth, although overall the cumulative width does increase downwards. A scaling law is developed relating shear zone width to rheology and displacement rate, assuming simple shear and neglecting stretching parallel to the shear plane, and rheological parameters for granitoids with a quartz, feldspar, or mica dominated microstructure are quantified. Localization during exhumation was primarily accompanied by hydrous retrogression of feldspar to white mica, and the associated formation of interconnected weak mica layers. This weakened the shear zone, allowing the degree of strain localization to increase (and the shear zone width to decrease) by a factor of ~4\u20139.\n               ","177":"\n                  Among the geologic data, trenching records of paleoearthquakes represent an important input for the development of seismic hazard evaluations and, specifically, for the characterization of fault rupture behavior in time.\n                  Based on the available paleoseismological trenching data in the Central Apennines (Italy) we have compiled a new database of surface faulting earthquakes for 10 faults. The compilation contains 109 surface faulting events, occurred in the past ~28 kyr. Events younger than 7 kyr (59 dated events) are much better constrained and, therefore, are the basis for most of the analyses. Through a quantitative multistep method, we integrate paleoseismic trench data and treat them statistically, providing relevant improvement needed for trenching-based seismic hazard evaluation. Indeed, the combined analysis of trenching data from multiple sites on the same fault led to a reduction of the approximations and uncertainties in the rupture history of individual faults. The procedure was also applied on specific fault systems and indicated that the single faults may have occasionally ruptured simultaneously, or close in time, in the past. The whole set of age ranges was also statistically analyzed to produce regional earthquake scenarios for a period much longer than the millennial historical record. The built scenarios for the last 7 kyr define a regional mean inter event time (IET) of 230\u2013240\u00a0yr, comparable with the average recurrence time of about 200\u00a0yr calculated for the region. We also identify the possible occurrence of earthquake storms, i.e., concentration of surface faulting earthquakes in the region within time periods of 200\u00a0yr, suggesting a variability in time of the seismic behavior of the faults, with alternation of peaks of activity with more \u201cquiet\u201d periods. Even though the paleoseismic data from the Apennines contains uncertainties, the results appear quite stable and promising for future applications in earthquake-hazard assessment.\n               ","178":"\n                  The tectonic movement rate, in situ stresses (e.g., normal stress) and fault roughness may change during the long evolutionary histories of seismogenic faults. To investigate the effects of these three factors on fault slip behaviors, we conducted direct shear tests by sequentially changing the shear loading rate and normal stress on small-scale granite specimens under three roughness conditions. We found that for a given fault system, the shear loading rate is a primary controlling parameter of the recurrence intervals of stick-slip events, and the correlation between them can be empirically expressed by a power law. Stick-slip recurrence intervals can influence the stress drops of stick-slip events via two different tendencies. The shear stress drops increase quasilinearly with the recurrence intervals at a given shear loading rate, while the combined data from all shear rate tests show that the shear stress drops increase with the logarithm of the recurrence time. In the investigated range of fault roughness, we observed that surface roughness conditions strikingly affect the sliding mode and recurrence frequency of stick-slip events. In detail, the two smooth fault systems slide with regular stick-slip events, and the roughest fault system exhibits bimodal behavior. Namely, at lower normal stresses, stick-slip events cannot be stably generated, a few were occasionally generated, and regular stick-slip events were interrupted by local stick-slip. When the applied normal stress is sufficiently high, the fault slides with continuous regular stick-slip events in the same way as those in the smoother fault systems. We further noticed that the recurrence frequency of stick-slip and friction drop are correlated at a fixed sliding distance, and this relationship can be described by an inverse proportional function. Our results suggest that all three factors, namely, shear loading rate, fault surface roughness and normal stress, can influence the behaviors of fault slip and hence are important for evaluating earthquake hazards.\n               ","179":"\n                  We present crustal azimuthal anisotropy measurements at 246 stations by fitting the sinusoidal moveout of P-to-S receiver functions to infer crustal deformation field in the northeastern (NE) Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. The dominant orientation of the observed crustal anisotropy shows a systematic spatial variation: NW-SE in the NE Tibetan Plateau and western Alxa Block, nearly NE-SW in the eastern Alxa Block and Yinchuan-Hetao Graben, and E-W in the eastern portion of the Western Qinling Terrane. The magnitude of crustal anisotropy varies from 0.15 to 0.75\u00a0s with an average of 0.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0s. Fault parallel crustal anisotropy with large magnitudes observed in the NE Tibetan Plateau provides independent constraints on the lateral extent of the deformation zone associated with the faults. The observed spatial distribution of crustal anisotropy, when combined with previous crustal velocity and Poisson's ratio measurements, implies that channel flow in the middle-to-lower crust is unlikely to exist beneath the NE Tibetan Plateau. The main characteristics of crustal anisotropy observed in the western Alxa Block are similar to areas affected by the Indo-Eurasian collision, while those observed in the eastern Alxa Block are comparable to the stable North China Craton.\n               ","180":"\n                  Deciphering the internal composition of large-scale fault zones helps to better understand the various geologic factors that govern their seismic rupture behavior. We used new detailed geologic, structural, and geomorphic map of an excellent natural laboratory in the Southern Yangsan Fault (SYF) in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula to elucidate the fault zone architecture and its controls on the rupture processes of neotectonic earthquakes. The Yangsan Fault is a major strike\u2013slip fault, and a subsidiary fault within the fault zone ruptured during the 2016 ML 5.8 Gyeongju earthquake which is the largest instrumental record in the intraplate Korean Peninsula. The 12-km-long study area in the SYF shows along-strike variations in wall rock lithology and fault zone architecture. At the south of the study area, the fault zone surrounded by crystalline rocks consists of a single major fault core. In contrast, at the north, the fault zone is sandwiched between crystalline rocks and sedimentary rocks and exhibits multiple major fault cores bounding broken-up wall rock blocks. The width of the across-fault damage zone, which was estimated from the cumulative fracture frequency with the distance from the major fault core, widens northward, indicating the distributed deformation of the northern fault zone over a long history of fault evolution. The geometry of paleoearthquake surface ruptures traced by the geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence of deformed young deposits diverge to multiple strands in the northern fault zone but converge to a single strand in the southern fault zone, directly reflecting its internal architecture. We propose that the long-lived rupturing patterns have been primarily controlled by intrinsic discontinuity- and mineralogy-dependent deformation processes in terms of strain-hardening vs. strain-weakening, along with propagation arrest and rupture tip damage due to a fault-bend geometry (geometric barrier) and an abrupt change in wall rock lithology (relaxation barrier).\n               ","181":"\n                  We present a source model for the 2019 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06 Mirpur earthquake, NW Himalaya using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements. Bayesian inversion of InSAR data from both ascending and descending orbits suggests that the earthquake ruptured a shallow (Depth\u00a0~\u00a05\u00a0km), near-horizontal (Dip ~2.5\u00b0) up-dip portion of the d\u00e9collement of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). The distributed slip model suggests a compact rupture terminating the up-dip end at the base of the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) with higher slip (> 0.4\u00a0m) around the hypocentre, equivalent to a moment magnitude of Mw\u00a0=\u00a06. A shallow up-dip rupture of the MHT through a moderate magnitude earthquake is atypical as Himalayan earthquakes generally originate at the down-dip portion of the MHT and propagate towards south. We estimate a low effective coefficient of friction of 0.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 from the slip model and suggest that high pore fluid pressures and\/or a weak, lubricated portion of d\u00e9collement could have caused a local, near-horizontal rupture at the base of the MFT. The 2019 Mirpur earthquake released a small fraction of the accumulated strain energy since the 1555 Kashmir earthquake. Coseismic Coulomb stress change analysis suggests a significant increase in stress on the locked, up-dip portion of the MHT and the frontal fold-thrust system. These findings compel a revisit of the seismic hazard assessment of the northwestern Himalaya.\n               ","182":"\n                  The Longitudinal Valley in eastern Taiwan is generally considered as a collisional suture between the Philippine Sea and the Eurasian plates. Offshore to the northeast of the valley, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting beneath the Ryukyu Arc. The corner between eastern Taiwan and the Ryukyu Arc system is therefore the transition from plate collision to plate subduction. In consequence, the area has complicated tectonics and frequent earthquakes. In this study, we used marine geophysical data to study the submarine Hualien Ridge that is situated in this plate collision\/subduction transition zone. Our results show that the Hualien Ridge is tectonically divided into the active southern part and the inactive northern part. In the southern Hualien Ridge, we find several ~N30\u00b0E trending active faults and some could be linked to the active faults in the onshore Milun Tableland. The structures in the southern Hualien Ridge and the Milun Tableland display a pop-up structure that is subject to the oblique compression from the northwestward motion of the Philippine Sea Plate. The ~N30\u00b0E trending faults are the results of the transpressional system. However, the Milun Fault, the western boundary of the fault system, probably terminates near 24\u00b003\u2032N, where a pronounced bathymetric depression trending N300\u00b0 cuts across the whole Hualien Ridge. In fact, all the active faults in the southern Hualien Ridge only appear to the south of the bathymetric depression. In contrast, in the northern Hualien Ridge we only find blind normal faults covered by ~100\u00a0m thick sediments. The distinct variation of tectonic activity in the Hualien Ridge underlines the transition from the active collision to inactive collision or partial subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate relative to the Eurasian Plate.\n               ","183":"\n                  Seismic mapping of subsurface faults is hampered by factors such as seismic resolution, velocity control for depth conversion and human bias. Here, we explore the challenges and pitfalls related to interpreting normal faults by comparing objective and subjective uncertainties. A panel of 20 interpreters, with different geoscientific backgrounds, interpreted faults in modern conventional (dominant frequency 40\u00a0Hz) and high-resolution P-Cable (dominant frequency 150\u00a0Hz) 3D seismic data from the Hoop area, SW Barents Sea. The interpretations created by the test-panel were sorted into 10 scenarios characterized by different fault geometries. These scenarios were explored with 2(3)D point-spread function based convolution seismic modelling to investigate the potential of seismic data to image detailed fault architectures. The results reveal that: (1) Statistical analysis shows considerable variations between manually picked faults. (2) Identifying the location of fault tips is challenging and smaller antithetic faults are rarely recognizable. (3) Uncertainties arise from masking of closely spaced fault segments even where displacement values are large, showing distorted reflection signatures of apparent extensional fault tip monoclines. The distortion is larger for conventional versus high-resolution data. (4) In the conventional and high-resolution seismic data the vertical resolution of closely spaced reflections and small offset faults is 20\u00a0m and 5\u00a0m, respectively. (5) The utilisation of high-resolution seismic data, combined with seismic modelling, add confidence to interpretation of conventional seismic data in the same area. We conclude that subsurface fault mapping with seismic data requires insight in objective uncertainties associated with the data. Automatic machine-learning fault interpretation is void of subjective bias but still hampered by objective limitations. Further, a risking workflow requires acknowledgement of uncertainties that are transferred to seismic based fault analysis techniques such as juxtaposition analysis, quantitative fault seal analysis, and fault stability analysis.\n               ","184":"\n                  The Cathaysia Block is located in South China, along the western margin of the Pacific plate, and well known for its widespread granitoids and rich poly-metallic mineralization.

In this study, we have conducted a dense broad-band seismic observation in the Cathaysia Block, and obtained the fine crustal structure of it by using P-wave receiver functions and analyzing other geophysical and geological studies comprehensively. Our study has following findings: (1) the crust of the Cathaysia Block is ~31.5\u00a0km thick, thinner than that of the global continent, and is interpreted to have been thinned since the Late Mesozoic; (2) the Vp\/Vs ratio of the Cathaysia Block is lower than that of the global continent, which implies there is no extensive underplating beneath the Cathaysia Block, or that the magma may be confined at bottom of the crust and formed a velocity gradient belt around Moho; (3) Zhenghe-Dapu fault is marked as the structural boundary between the western and eastern Cathaysia Block; (4) the western and eastern Cathaysia Block have different intra-crustal structures, petrochronology features and mineralization settings; (5) the subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate and the following roll-back could be responsible for the geodynamic evolution of the crustal deformation, as well as the widespread magmatism and mineralization.\n               ","185":"\n                  The northern Central America region (Honduras and Nicaragua) is characterized by geotectonic units delimited by strike-slip fault systems and shortening zones of poorly constrained ages.

The Dipilto batholith age (119\u2013112 Ma) implies a syn-collisional origin that together with our results indicate an Early Cretaceous progressive shortening in the region associated with the Siuna Intraoceanic Arc collision (~134\u2013113\u00a0Ma). Furthermore, they indicate that the shortening azimuth (i.e., the direction of tectonic transport) is ~127\u00b0\u2013137\u00b0 in its current geographical position, but was 227\u00b0\u2013237\u00b0 in its Early Cretaceous paleo-position, probably related to the final stage of shortening and collision events of the southwestern Mexican paleocontinent.\n               ","186":"\n                  The Messejana-Plasencia dyke (End-Triassic), NE-SW oriented, is the longest simple structure in Iberia (~500\u00a0km) and constitutes a first-order rheological discontinuity that crosses the entire crust. During the Alpine deformation, this discontinuity nucleated the Messejana-Plasencia left-lateral strike-slip fault and its related strike-slip deformation belt, consisting of a series of wide coalescent stepovers and small basins developed on the footwalls. Both structures can be followed from offshore of SW mainland Portugal to the central sector of the Spanish-Portuguese Central System. Using tectonic, geophysical, magnetic, and gravimetric analyses, our study demonstrated that it extends NE more than ~100\u00a0km below the continental sediments of the Duero Cenozoic Basin, until the Iberian Chain. We used a tectonostratigraphic analysis to determine the age of the wrench fault movement and that of the Spanish-Portuguese thrusts. In this range, the largest displacement during the Cenozoic occurred in the southern thrust of the Spanish sector of the Central System over the Madrid Cenozoic Basin, and NE-SW trending. This thrust displaces the Moho more than 10\u00a0km and probably joins the Messejana-Plasencia strike-slip fault at depth. The deduced age movement for both is Oligocene-Lower-Middle Miocene, related to the intraplate stresses transmitted from the Pyrenean orogen towards its foreland.

The segments strike N31\u00b0E \u2013 N35\u00b0E, dip 70\u00b0 NW and have focal depths between 1 and 9\u00a0km. The seismogenic fault coincides with a swarm of silica-rich veins that range in size from a few centimeters wide and 1\u20132\u00a0m long to 20\u201350\u00a0m wide and hundreds of m long. These structures encompass a V1 vein set composed of quartz veins parallel to the Proterozoic-Archean basement metamorphic foliation and a V2 vein set composed of chalcedony, opal, cryptocrystalline silica, and quartz geodes that cut across Cretaceous siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary units in the basin and the basement. Fluid inclusions from the V1 vein set yield trapping temperatures of 91\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013336\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas the V2 vein set yields temperatures of 147\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013388\u00a0\u00b0C. The fluid inclusions and oxygen isotope analyses indicate a magmatic fluid source, although contamination by lateritic soil\u2013derived fluids can be recognized in the V2 vein set. We conclude that in the Samambaia fault, fluid pressure reduces the effective stress until the fault experiences failure, contributing to fault weakening and seismicity. Subsequent cooling of hydrothermal fluids leads to fault healing after coseismic slip and precipitation of Si-rich cements. This process was associated with variation from hydrostatic to lithostatic pressure during cementation, reducing permeability along the fault. Then, the fault locks and fluid pressures begin to rise again. We interpret the superposed V1 and V2 vein sets as the expression of fault-valve behavior caused by repeated fluid-driven reactivation through time along preexisting structures in an extended, rifted crust.\n               ","188":"\n                  We studied mantle xenoliths sampled from two late Miocene volcanic centers located immediately north of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) in western Turkey.

Spinel displays dominantly oblate fabric ellipsoids, consistent with flattening strain. Olivine crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), determined by electron backscatter diffraction, exhibits chiefly axial-[010] and A-type patterns. The axial-[010] CPO pattern is consistent with the spinel fabric that shows flattening strain, and is primarily developed in xenoliths from the volcanic center nearer to the NAFZ. Obliquity of olivine CPO to the spinel lineation decreases with proximity to the NAFZ, suggesting an increase in shear strain.

Rock magnetic analysis indicated that the main magnetic carriers were hematite and magnetite. After detailed thermal demagnetization analyses, the characteristic remanent magnetizations of 48 sites (387 samples), which exhibited dual polarities and passed a regional fold test, are most likely the primary magnetizations. Two periods of remarkable rotations are identified at Heishiqiu: a clockwise rotation of ~16.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.3\u00b0 during ~27\u201317\u00a0Ma and a subsequent counterclockwise rotation of ~24.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.5\u00b0 during ~17\u201310\u00a0Ma.

The integrated lines of paleomagnetic and geological evidence suggest that the deformation along the ATF has propagated both southwestward and northeastward from Heishiqiu in the middle ATF since the Early Oligocene.

The solution to the focal mechanism indicates that the earthquake of 30 October 2020 occurred on a normal fault with nodal planes of E-W strike; thus, indicating extension in N-S direction. The fault plane solutions show a N-S trending extension for normal faults, which are obtained by inverting the moment tensor waveforms of 23 earthquakes and the P-wave first motion polarities of 11 aftershocks. A normal fault stress regime of approximately N-S (N6\u00b0E) \u03c33 axis is given by the inversion of slip vectors measured at sites located on land in Ku\u015fadas\u0131. The mean R value is 0.84, suggesting that the stress regime is triaxial extensional stress state.

For the 30 October 2020 earthquake (Mw:6.8), the Coulomb failure stress change analysis shows a substantial reduction in stress in the N-S direction supporting the kinematic results.

The Main Marmara Fault (MMF), which is part of the NAFZ, contains an approximately 150\u00a0km long seismotectonic segment that has not ruptured since 1766. A key question for seismic hazard and risk assessment is whether or not the next rupture along this segment is likely to produce one major earthquake or a series of smaller earthquakes. Geomechanical characteristics such as along-strike variations in rock strength may provide an important control on seismotectonic segmentation. We find that variations in lithospheric strength throughout the Marmara region control the mechanical segmentation of the MMF and help explain its long-term seismotectonic segmentation. In particular, a strong crust that is mechanically coupled to the upper mantle spatially correlates with aseismic patches, where the MMF bends and changes its strike in response to the presence of high-density lower crustal bodies. Between the bends, mechanically weaker crustal domains that are decoupled from the mantle indicate a predominance of creeping. These results are highly relevant for the ongoing debate regarding the characteristics of the Marmara seismic gap, especially in view of the seismic hazard (Mw\u00a0>\u00a07) in the densely populated Marmara region.\n               ","192":"\n                  Located in the northern end of the Manila Trench, the deformation front (DF) off southwestern Taiwan is considered as a potential area for generating hazardous earthquakes and tsunamis. However, this area has been relatively seismically quiet, and the seismogenic structure has been unclear, particularly in the middle-to-lower crust. On February 10, 2017, an Mw5.3 earthquake occurred in the near-shore area of Tainan in SW Taiwan, which provides us with a good opportunity to study the seismogenic structure of this area. Five ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) were deployed to cover the mainshock source area from February 13 to March 1, 2017, to record the aftershock data. All the OBSs were successfully recovered and, the P- and S-wave arrival were manually identified. In collaboration with arrival times from the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan, we simultaneously determined the 1-D optimal Vp and Vs velocity models and hypocenter locations. The inversion results show that the upper crust (<15\u00a0km) has a relatively low velocity, and most events are confined between 10 and 15\u00a0km depth. The relocated epicenters were all in areas with positive gravity anomalies, and most of them formed a NE-SW striking seismogenic structure that was approximately parallel to the surface trace of the DF and did not link to any known active faults in SW Taiwan. The hypocenters illustrate a conjugate fault system comprising of a SW-dipping NE-SW striking fault and an SE-dipping NW-SE striking fault. Based on focal mechanisms and aftershock distribution, we demonstrate that the 2017 Tainan near-shore earthquake may result from the reactivation of pre-existing faults, and the driving force comes from the bending stresses of the subducting Eurasia Plate at the Manila Trench. Given the active subduction processes offshore of Taiwan, such slab-flexural-related earthquakes must be considered in seismic and tsunami hazard assessments.\n               ","193":"\n                  The interplay between faulting and folding mechanisms has been recognised in extensional and contractional settings. Numerous investigations have documented that the analysis of structural aspects of fault-related folds is important for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon resources and in seismic data interpretation. In this study, we used four series of 2-D elastic-plastic finite element models (A, B, C, and D) to investigate the influence of internal friction angle, friction coefficient, and an additional detachment on the fault slip and uplift gradients, stress-strain patterns, and structural evolution of fault-propagation folds (FPFs). We found that: 1) the stress-strain patterns are similar in different sections of a FPF; 2) the plastic strain is concentrated at the fault tip, fault surface, and forelimb of the FPF; 3) among the internal friction angle, friction coefficient, and additional detachment parameters, only additional detachment affects the stress-strain patterns at the crest and backlimb of the FPF; 4) to create a FPF, not only must the fault friction be less than the layers, but the layer friction also has to be less than a threshold; 5) increase in the internal friction angle, decrease in the friction coefficient, and generation of an additional detachment lead to the formation of tight folds whereas, decrease in the internal friction angle and increase in the friction coefficient create wide folds; and 6) the internal friction angle and friction coefficient are two key factors of the fault-related fold style.\n               ","194":"\n                  The S\u00e3o Francisco intracratonic basin, eastern Brazil, hosts multiple sedimentary successions younger than 1.8Ga that witnessed major plate reorganizations since its generation. During the Brasiliano\/Pan-African Gondwana amalgamation, in the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, the western half of the basin was involved in the Bras\u00edlia foreland fold-thrust belt, which propagated eastwards deforming its Proterozoic-Paleozoic strata. Lately, as the South Atlantic rift evolved giving rise to the Brazilian continental margin, the basin was affected by extensional tectonism leading to the development of the Cretaceous Abaet\u00e9 half-graben. During this episode, elements related to a prominent structure of the Bras\u00edlia foreland fold-thrust belt, the Jo\u00e3o Pinheiro fault, were reactivated controlling the graben architecture. Aiming to unravel the evolutionary history of the fault zone since its nucleation until its Cretaceous extensional reactivation, we conducted a structural investigation based on field, well-tied 2D seismic data, and paleostress analysis. Our study revealed that the fault represents an emergent ramp of the basal detachment of the Brasilia foreland fold-thrust belt. Formed under EW-oriented shortening, the structure exhibits a gentle recces-salient geometry in map view, which reflects variations in the detachment depth influenced by pre-orogenic rift structures. Trains of NS-trending chevron folds are abundant and their high symmetry and dominance are expressions of the control exerted by mechanical stratigraphy and low-friction basal detachment. The superposed Abaet\u00e9 half-graben developed under an extensional regime with a NE-trending maximum extension. Under this condition, a stratigraphic interface along the Jo\u00e3o Pinheiro fault zone was reactivated giving rise to the graben border fault. NS- to NW-oriented preexisting bedding planes were activated as small normal faults. Although newly-formed faults are present, reactivation is the most effective mechanism of extension accommodation. Therefore, this study provides insights on the influence of tectonic inheritance on the architecture, deformation pattern, strain\/stress partitioning and evolution of both extensional and compressional intracontinental systems.\n               ","195":"\n                  The Tian Shan mountain range maintains high topography across the Eurasian continent despite being distal to any modern plate boundary. Previous studies of the Tian Shan have revealed a history of mountain building in response to India-Asia collision which has overprinted much of its Mesozoic history. The Karatau and Talas ranges in the north-western Tian Shan represent a unique opportunity to investigate the erosional response to the Mesozoic tectonics of Central Asia. In this study, we present medium-to-low temperature thermochronology and thermal history modelling from a series of Neoproterozoic to Permian sedimentary and granitoid samples taken from the Karatau and Talas ranges. Our results identify three phases of late Paleozoic-Mesozoic deformation and exhumation: (1) a regional orogenic event in the Permian\u2013Early Triassic (ca. 280\u2013240\u00a0Ma) related to the final amalgamation of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, (2) Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (ca. 230\u2013190\u00a0Ma) reactivation in response to the collision of the Qiangtang block with the Eurasian margin, and a (3) phase of rapid basement cooling during the Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous (ca. 160\u2013140\u00a0Ma), associated with the closure of the Meso-Tethys Ocean.

Very little attention has been paid so far to the nature of the driving mechanisms responsible for these atypical rift patterns. New insights are supplied by the Natron-Ol Doinyo Ogol rift segment at the southern extremity of the SKR, immediately north of the North Tanzanian Divergence (NTD). On the basis of interpreted SRTM-30 satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Models, our work allows us: i) to depict the highly-segmented arrangement of the ~7\u00a0Ma-lasted SKR system, ii) to establish a two-stage kinematic rift model that emphasizes the role of an inherited transverse discontinuity on the arrest, as well as lateral jump and off-axis development of anomalously-propagating rift structures, iii) to define the relative contribution of border vs inner fault networks to the total extension, which is estimated at 7\u20136\u00a0km (11.6\u20139.2%), and iv) to emphasize that inner faulting was not the dominant mode of strain accommodation during recent inward focussing of strain, and that no sharp transition exists from border fault- to intra-rift fault-dominated strain accommodation over time in the SKR immature rift system.\n               ","197":"\n                  Pre-existing faults in the mechanical basement are believed to play an important role in controlling deformation of the thin-skinned Jura Mountains fold-and-thrust belt, which constitutes the northernmost extension of the European Alps. We use brittle-viscous analogue models to investigate the influence of frontal and oblique basement steps on the subsequent evolution of structures during thin-skinned shortening. Vertical offset between two rigid baseplates (simulating the mechanical basement) causes the formation of reverse faults and grabens in the overlying brittle layers that are not reactivated during subsequent thin-skinned shortening. However, baseplate steps localise deformation, causing a temporary frontward propagation of deformation in an early stage and inhibiting propagation afterwards. Downward baseplate steps induce very strong deformation localisation and foster the formation of fault-bend folds. Models featuring upward steps develop step-controlled pop-up structures with imbricated fronts and viscous ramps that shorten dynamically with progressive contraction. We find that deformation localisation increases both with higher step-throws and lower obliquity (\u03b1) of the strike of the step (e.g. frontal step \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0). With increasing step-throws, \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a030\u00b0 and \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a045\u00b0 oblique upward-steps lead to a characteristic imbrication of the brittle cover with laterally confined thrust-slices and step-parallel oblique-thrusts, which rotate up to 15\u00b0 about a vertical axis over time. Step-controlled backthrusts preceding the formation of thrust-slices do not show notable rotation and hence constitute excellent indicators for the orientation of oblique upward-steps. The topographic patterns of oblique-step models resemble individual thin-skinned structures of the Internal Jura (i.e. Pontarlier and Vuache fault zones, the nappe system SE of Oyonnax and the Chasseral anticline), strongly suggesting that pre-existing NNE-SSW and NW-SE striking oblique upward-steps in the basement controlled deformation in the overlying cover. Our model results may be applied to other thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belts worldwide that formed above pre-existing basement structures.\n               ","198":"\n                  The Jiaodong Peninsula of eastern China is densely populated and prone to frequent moderate-strong earthquakes that are mostly distributed along a group of northeastern oriented Mesozoic-Cenozoic faults. An improved understanding of the seismic velocity structure in the area is of great significance for the roles that the faults played in the formation and evolution of the various tectonic features and for the assessment of future earthquake risks. By utilizing earthquake records of the Shandong Provincial Seismic Network for the period from January 2013 to January 2020, this study simultaneously re-locates earthquakes and determines the three-dimensional P-wave velocity structure beneath the Jiaodong Peninsula using regional P-wave travel times by applying the double-difference tomography method. After the relocation, the travel time residuals are reduced by an order of magnitude, and the epicenters are more concentrated and demonstrate a closer spatial relationship with known active faults. The resulting P-wave velocity structure at different horizon depths indicates lateral heterogeneities in the study area. Clear differences in the characteristics of velocity anomalies are observed between the Jiaobei Uplift, Jiaolai Basin and Sulu ultra-high pressure metamorphic belt. The anomalies are mostly NE oriented, which is consistent with the strike of the regional faults and may suggest structural control of the faults to the geological configurations. Earthquakes generally occurred along the edges of high or low velocity regions, and areas accommodating the intersections of the Penglai-Weihai, Penglai-Qixia and Mouping-Jimo fault zones have the greatest potential for future damaging earthquakes in the area.\n               ","199":"\n                  The control exerted by the Mesozoic basin configuration on the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Catalan Coastal Ranges has been frequently recognized as a key factor to explain its present-day structure. However, details of this structural inheritance and its evolution through geological time is still under discussion. In this work we present two structural cross-sections based on fieldwork, well and magnetotelluric data in order to illustrate the structural styles and tectonic evolution of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High. Here, the Montmell Fault not only constitutes the SW segment of one of the major Neogene faults in the Catalan Coastal Ranges (the Montmell-Vall\u00e8s Fault System), but also the NW limit of a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous extensional basin(the Montmell-Garraf Basin), facts that denote a major role of this fault in the tectonic evolution of the area. The present-day structure of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High resulted, therefore, from two successive episodes of inversion during the Cenozoic. The first one reactivated the Montmell Fault as compressional during the Paleogene. As a result, and among other inversion-related structures, the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust developed sa major NW-directed basement footwall shortcut. Later on, the previously formed compressional structure during the Paleogene became reactivated as extensional during the Neogene. During this phase, the reactivation of the Montmell Fault looks limited and, hence, the extension is transmitted to the Baix Pened\u00e8s Fault. The reactivation of the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust is also manifest in the development of an array of extensional faults in the backlimb of the Carme-Cabra Anticline that corresponds to the NE-end of El Camp Fault. This episode of negative inversion developed accommodation zones between the four major faults present in the area ( Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s, Montmell, El Camp and Baix Pened\u00e8s faults) that are characterized by the presence of relay ramps with breaching faults.\n               ","200":"\n                  Earthquake gates are fault geometric complexities, common in natural fault systems, that conditionally impede earthquake ruptures. This study centers on modeling of multicycle dynamics of the Pingding Shan earthquake gate along the central Altyn Tagh Fault in northwest China. The earthquake gate includes three geometric complexities: a prominent restraining bend, a 4-km wide stepover to the east, and a releasing bend to the west. We use a 2D finite element method to simulate coseismic spontaneous ruptures with interseismic fault stress evolutions computed by an analytic viscoelastic solution. Paleoseismic records and long-term slip-rates are used to constrain the models. We find that fault-geometry-related heterogenous stresses accumulated over earthquake cycles yield complex rupture patterns and help explain earthquake recurrence intervals revealed by paleoseismic records. The three most important contributions to the heterogeneous stresses come from dynamic ruptures passing fault geometric complexities, fault-strike-dependent tectonic loading and relaxation, and stress history from past earthquakes. In the Pingding Shan earthquake gate, the releasing stepover appears to impede ruptures more effectively than the restraining bend. The combined impact of the restraining bend and the releasing stepover makes the Pingding Shan earthquake gate a very effective barrier to 350-km model-spanning ruptures. The best-fit model yields a low recurrence interval of 4.6 kyrs for 350-km-long ruptures, interspersed with more frequent ruptures limited to individual fault segments. A lower static friction tends to reduce the effectiveness of the earthquake gate to impede ruptures. Local fault geometric complexities together with rapid energy release and restrengthening of friction during dynamic ruptures help explain the 0.66 recurrence interval coefficient of variation (COV) recorded at the Copper Mine paleoseismic trench site on the Xorxoli segment. This study provides a method for applying heterogenous initial stresses for single-event dynamic rupture simulations that consider the effect of past earthquakes and fault geometry.\n               ","201":"\n                  This study examines the scaling relationship between fault length and displacement for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the evolution of normal faults within the central Kenya Rift. 620 normal faults were manually mapped from a digital elevation model (DEM), with 30\u00a0m2 resolution and an estimated maximum displacement of ~40\u2013~6030\u00a0m and fault lengths of 1270 \u2010 60,600\u00a0m. To assess the contribution of fault populations to the strain accommodation from south to north, the study area has been divided into three zones of fault populations based upon their average fault orientations; zone 1 in the north is dominated by NNE striking faults, zone 2 in the centre of the rift is characterised by NNW to NNE fault trends, whereas zone 3 in the south is characterised by NNW striking fault systems. Extensional strain was estimated by summing fault heaves across six transects along the rift, which showed a progressive increase of strain from south to north. The fault length and displacement data in the three zones fit to a power law distribution. The cumulative distributions of fault length populations showed similar fractal dimension (D) in the three zones. The cumulative displacement distributions for the three zones showed a decrease in the Power-law fractal dimension with increasing strain, which implies that the strain is increasingly localized onto larger faults as the fault system becomes more evolved from south to north. Increasing displacement with increasing strain while the fault length remains almost constant may indicate that the fault system could be evolving in accordance with a constant length fault growth model, where faults lengthen quickly and then accrue displacement. Results of this study suggest that the process of progressively increasing fault system maturity and strain localization onto large faults can be observed even over a relatively small area (240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0km) within the rift system.

Here, we present the results of a magnetotelluric (MT) investigation carried out in the southeastern part of the Kachchh intraplate region illuminating the seismogenic zone of the 1956 Anjar earthquake (Mw 6.0). The two-dimensional geoelectrical model derived from the MT data acquired at 21 sites along a NE-SW profile reveals assemblage of conductive and resistive zones in the upper and the mid crustal depths in the close vicinity of the major fault zones and the hypocentral depths. The results reveal a very high conductive zone near the Moho, affirming the presence of an upper mantle fluidized zone. Unlike the South Wagad Fault, the Kachchh Mainland Fault and the Katrol Hill Fault do not have a downward lower crustal extension, and terminate at the mid crustal depths. We suggest that the presence of trapped fluids in the brittle-ductile transition zone (12\u201315\u00a0km) and their seepage to the resistive plutons might be a possible mechanism for triggering the 1956 event as well as the current seismic activity in the region.\n               ","203":"\n                  The structural evolution of the Larnaka Ridge is studied using high-resolution multichannel seismic reflection profiles and multibeam mosaics of the seafloor.

In the present study seismotectonic aspects of the 2017 Karaburun-Lesvos earthquake and its aftershock sequence are studied. A rupture model based on finite source analysis of the teleseismic waveforms has shown that the earthquake was associated with a failure of single asperity. About 5\u00a0days after the mainshock a temporary seismic network of 8 broadband stations (Real-time Aftershock Forecasting in Turkey, RAFT) had been deployed along the Turkish Aegean coast to enhance the existing regional seismic monitoring and the acquired data have been used to relocate the aftershocks. The temporary deployment significantly improved the aftershock detection capacity and resulted in more precise locations. Prior to the monitoring enhancement a single widespread aftershock cluster was observed; however, the relocated aftershocks, augmented by the RAFT stations, identified two distinct spatially isolated clusters. The first day of the aftershock sequence has been used for retrospective real-time aftershock forecasting up to 7\u00a0days following the mainshock. Our results indicate that with a method developed by Omi et al.

Along the graben shoulder, a density anomaly (+200\u00a0kg\/m3) suggests a propylitization zone corresponding to the reservoir, underlying the typical conductive clay cap updomings and downdomings of high-T geothermal systems.\n                  A major conductive plume, without an appreciable gravity signature, occurs in the graben shoulder. Integration with the geochemical results allows to interpret it as a vapor-cored system. The hot spring water CO2, H2S and Cl content indicates the contamination of magmatic gases into the reservoir that produce fluid acidification while ascending from a deep source. The local bulk resistivity (10 Ohm m) is explainable by assuming conductive permeating acid fluids (10\u00a0S\/m), an enhanced porosity (20%) and a significant gas saturation (20%). The absence of an appreciable density increase is also justified by the hypothesised porosity and the gas fraction. Since the acidic fluids are neutralised by interaction with the host rock, the sampled waters are nearly pH-neutral.\n                  Our results suggest the first occurrence of a vapor-cored system in divergent plate tectonics, such as the Tendaho Graben sector of the Afar rift zone.\n               ","211":"\n                  Satellite image-based lineament mapping in combination with the normalised Stream Length Gradient Index (SL\/K-index) is one of the most widely used methods to identify active faults in areas where other verification methods, such as faulted strata, geophysical subsurface data, or seismic activity in the upper crust, are unavailable, and to classify their degree of activity. The accuracy of this approach, however, has not yet been assessed rigorously. We assess its accuracy by comparing the results against 27 thrust fault segments that were identified from six seismic reflection profiles with a total length of 340\u00a0km. Over 106,000 SL\/K points were calculated from 815 river profiles on basis of the SRTM v.3.0 DEM. Standard deviations (SD) of < -2SD (class 1) to > +2SD (class 5) were calculated from the lognormalised SL\/K data and five SL\/K classes were made and assigned to the nearby lineaments. A comparison with the fault segments from the seismic profiles showed a good coincidence between the presence of knickpoints, SL\/K classes 4 and 5 and to a lesser extent class 3. Lineaments with SL\/K classes 1 and 2 never corresponded to actual faults. We identified seven master thrusts of which three are very active to highly active, likely older, structures with important amounts of accumulated slip. The other thrusts are probably younger faults with relatively little accumulated slip, yet they are also active to highly active faults. Minor strike-slip faults were identified as very active to highly active structures. Published slip rates shows that at least some of the SL\/K class 4 faults experience slip rates of ~1 to ~4\u00a0mm a\u22121 and the SL\/K class 5 strike-slip faults may experience slip rates as high as one metre over the course of several months. Most active faults occur where the basal evaporite layer is abnormally thick.\n               ","212":"\n                  The age of breakup which formed the Central-North Atlantic has been debated for many decades and is still subject to debate: from ca. 150\u00a0Ma to 110\u00a0Ma. To address this issue, we have carried out a thermochronological study of the eastern margin of the rifted Iberia-Newfoundland sector. New apatite fission-track (AFT) data acquired on samples from the footwall (Variscan basement) and one sample (Triassic of the Lusitanian Basin) from the hanging wall of the principal normal fault bounding the basin. Thermal history of western Iberia can be then reconstructed since ca. 250\u00a0Ma. Fission-track ages of Variscan granitoids (whose crystallization age is >275\u00a0Ma) range between 191\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0Ma and 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma, indicating that significant thermal events affected the study area during that period. Thermal inversion supports two main cooling events that we attribute to a major uplift and denudation of the Variscan basement, consistent with widespread basement-derived siliciclastic rocks of similar ages: Late Jurassic\/Early Cretaceous (ca. 150\u2013145\u00a0Ma) and late Early Cretaceous (ca. 110\u00a0Ma). From the sedimentary record in the Lusitanian Basin and the new AFT data, we deduce that: (1) temperatures >70\u2013110\u00a0\u00b0C affected west Iberia between ca. 190 and 150\u00a0Ma, which can be explained partly by a subsiding basement in both foot and hanging walls; (2) the main cooling event at ca. 150\u2013145\u00a0Ma is interpreted as major rift flank uplift; (3) the ca. 110\u00a0Ma cooling event may be linked to the final evolution of the margin and onset of oceanic spreading. We infer that the AFT main cooling event at ca. 150\u2013145\u00a0Ma reflects the break of the elastic core of the lithosphere (whole lithosphere failure\u00a0=\u00a0breakup) with significant rift shoulder uplift (end of Rift 1), which was followed by hyper-extension and mantle exhumation (Rift 2) and finally, by oceanic spreading (rift-to-drift) at ca. 110\u00a0Ma (onset of Rift 3).\n               ","213":"\n                  It has long been debated whether the formation of the Cenozoic Weihe and Shanxi grabens in North China was induced by the Indo\u2013Asia collision or Pacific Plate subduction. Deciding between these two models requires precise knowledge of the timing of the graben formation. In this study, we used high-resolution magnetostratigraphy to suggest that the age of a\u00a0~\u00a01644-m thick syn-rift section conjoining the two grabens spanned from ~54.3 to ~3\u00a0Ma. The section is marked by three unconformities dated at ~26, ~12, and\u00a0~\u00a07\u00a0Ma. The precise ages, combined with field observations, indicate the following: the Weihe Graben underwent four rifting stages that started at ~54.3\u00a0Ma, whereas the Shanxi Graben opened at ~7\u00a0Ma. The synchronous timing between the basin development and uplift history of the Qinling Range strongly suggests that the Cenozoic extension across the Weihe and Shanxi grabens was coupled with left-slip faulting bounded at the northern edge of the Qinling. As the Qinling left-slip fault indicates eastward extrusion during the northward penetration of India, our work supports the early hypothesis that the opening of the north-trending rifts in North China was associated with the Cenozoic Indo\u2013Asia collision. As the basin history across the Weihe and Shanxi grabens can also be correlated with the Bohai Bay evolution along the eastern margin of East Asia, the Pacific Plate may have also played a role in forming the two grabens. We conclude that the Cenozoic extension across North China has been controlled by both the Indo\u2013Asia collision and back-arc tectonics induced by westward subduction of the Pacific Plate.\n               ","214":"\n                  The 150\u00a0km long, 6\u00a0s TWT, 2D seismic profile KBF03A, which was acquired in 1994 and lies near the western edge of the Kaapvaal craton in South Africa, has been reprocessed using standard reflection seismic processing methods. The results exhibit a significant improvement in the imaging quality of the subsurface features and an evident boost in the signal-to-noise ratio. The improved seismic data, combined with application of seismic attributes, integration with surficial geological and geophysical maps, and computation of velocity tomograms, has revealed previously undetected structural features within the supracrustal sequences underlying the profile. In particular, the Phanerozoic sediments found along the profile, comprising exclusively Kalahari Group and Dwyka Group deposits, are disrupted by multiple folds of varying wavelengths (~1\u201310\u00a0km) and variably oriented normal and thrust faults. Additionally, the effect of the Moshaweng fault, previously characterised as a listric fault extending to depths of >10\u00a0km, on the Phanerozoic sediments has been further constrained to suggest repeated extensional reactivations and a more recent (<1\u00a0Ma) inversion. Considerations of the eastern end of the profile have suggested links between some of the observed structural features and the nearby ~146\u00a0Ma Morokweng impact structure, the lateral expanse of which is poorly constrained in the literature. The collection of these newly imaged features is interpreted as evidence for multiple Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic tectonic events, including polyphasic reactivation of basement structures, under both extensional and compressional stress regimes. By analysing these newly detected features, our study not only provides new insight into the neotectonic evolution of the Phanerozoic sediments along the western margin of the Kaapvaal craton, but also demonstrates the utility in reprocessing legacy data and reveals its untapped potential.\n               ","215":"\n                  Due to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate below the East Asian continent, the North China Craton (NCC) is considered to have been thinned in the Mesozoic, with the lithosphere of its east portion significantly thinned. As the eastern boundary of the NCC, The Tanlu Fault Zone (TLFZ) is one of the largest strike-slip fault systems in eastern Asia. Tanlu is believed to have recorded the destabilization of the NCC. Magnetotelluric array data collected in the TLFZ and adjacent areas are obtained to image the lithospheric three-dimensional resistivity structure and to discuss the structural constraints on this event. According to the resistivity model from the three-dimensional inversion, the crust of the Luxi Uplift (LXU) to the west of the TLFZ and the crust of the Sulu Orogenic Belt (SOB) to the east of the TLFZ exhibits high resistivity (>300 \u03a9m). Lithospheric mantle of the SOB also exhibits highly resistive characteristics. Conversely, the LXU mantle showed distinct low-resistivity characteristics (C3). Low-resistivity anomalies were found corresponding to both branches of the TLFZ. The eastern branch is a lithospheric low-resistivity belt, while the western branch formed a significant mantle resistivity boundary between the low-resistivity LXU and the high-resistivity SOB. Thus, we considered that molten materials may have upwelled along the weak area of the western branch, inducing a significant lithospheric thinning beneath the LXU. On the other hand, the lithosphere of the SOB has not been significantly thinned according to its high resistivity. The significant contrast of the resistivity may indicate that the western branch of the TLFZ is the boundary between the NCC and the SOB, with the sinistral strike-slip occurring along it.\n               ","216":"\n                  The Qingchengzi ore field, which is located in the middle of the Liaodong Peninsula, has a large number of Au, Ag, and Pb-Zn deposits owing to Mesozoic tectonic and magmatic-hydrothermal activities. To reveal the relationship between shallow crustal velocity and gold mineralization and provide constraints on deep ore prospecting (> 1.5\u00a0km), ambient noise tomography consisting of an experimental short-period dense array with 334 seismographs surrounding the study region, is adopted. Shallow crustal velocities at depths less than 5.0\u00a0km are obtained by a direct inversion method of Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion at a period of 0.5\u20133.0\u00a0s. We obtain the following results. (1) The Jianshanzi fault (JSZF) is well imaged at a depth of 5.0\u00a0km. Because ore-forming fluids and materials originated from adjacent concealed granite intrusions characterized by low-velocity anomalies, we infer that the JSZF contributed to mineralization. (2) The Baiyun gold alteration belt in the northern ore field has a high velocity and cuts through the surrounding low-velocity area, extending downward to approximately 0.9\u00a0km. This high-velocity belt may be a superposition of the marble of the Dashiqiao Formation and mineralization-alteration, which suggests that the depth of the belt may be of favorable prospecting potential. (3) Based on the obvious low-velocity intrusive anomalies beneath the southern Xiaotongjiapuzi gold belt, we deduce that the mineralization of the Xiaotongjiapuzi gold belt is controlled by unexposed granite intrusions and thus has high mineralization potential at great depths.

Approximately 50% of the reverse-dextral slip rate of the Alpine fault in the west transfers to the dextral central Hope Fault in the east via a horsetail splay zone of distributed oblique dextral-normal shear forming the Hope-Kelly fault system. The westernmost portion of the Hope fault is misoriented for dextral slip and is likely an extensional fault that accommodates the Alpine fault slip rate change across the intersection zone. As it transitions to an extensional fault, most of the strike-slip of the Hope fault is transferred southward onto Kelly fault strands via incipient, linking fault domains of coeval NE-SW and EW-striking dextral faults. The transition from the narrow zone defining the central Hope Fault to dispersed horsetail splays of the Hope-Kelly fault system is located immediately above the eastward down-dip projection of the Alpine Fault at the base of the seismogenic zone. This suggests that structural interactions among these faults within seismogenic depths control surface rupture geometries and kinematics. Coeval intermingling of surface rupture traces transecting latest Pleistocene to Holocene landforms indicates ongoing structural interactions in active faulting at the intersection of the Hope-Kelly fault splays with the Alpine fault. The transition from dextral to dextral normal kinematics on the horsetail splay accommodates differential orogenic growth through geometrically and kinematically efficient faulting that allows extension of the Alpine fault hanging wall parallel to strike, enabling the slip rate change between the central and northern Alpine fault sections.\n               ","218":"\n                  The current tectonic activity at the frontal part of the Eastern Alps is so far barely assessed due to the lack of geologic record and the scarcity of earthquakes in the external units of the fold-thrust belt and its foreland. This paper presents the results of a multidisciplinary study of the Austrian sector of the Imbricated Molasse Basin, near the Alpine floor thrust front, where independent geologic data proves active thrusting at different out-of-sequence thrusts.\n                  The integration of structural borehole image interpretation, in-situ stress analysis, geomechanical modeling, 3D seismic interpretation and surface geology shows that out-of-sequence thrusting had a significant impact on the local structural evolution of the frontal part of the Alpine belt. Stress data from boreholes penetrating two of the out-of-sequence thrusts in the Imbricated Molasse revealed stress perturbations indicating that these thrusts are currently active. This finding is supported by 1D geomechanical modeling that proved a thrust regime in the Molasse units and the overlying Rheno-Danubian Flysch.\n                  The observation of active thrusting of the imbricated Molasse units is in line with Pleistocene out-of-sequence thrusts in the external tectonic units of the Eastern Alps (Helvetic units and Rheno-Danubian Flysch). There, Pleistocene fluvial terraces of the Mindel glaciation (MIS 12) are vertically displaced by two different out-of-sequence thrusts, while the younger terraces appear undeformed. One of these thrusts is imaged in 3D seismic allowing to calculate a Pleistocene slip rate of 0.33 to 0.43\u00a0mm\/a from fault dip, terrace ages and vertical offset.\n                  In sum, our data proves that Quaternary shortening activated several pre-existing out-of-sequence thrusts in the frontal part of the Eastern Alps. Data, however, does not allow deciding whether Quaternary thrust shortening is a continuous process or occurs episodically, with each shortening episode reactivating different pre-existing structures.\n               ","219":"\n                  Late Quaternary slip rates characterize the seismic potential of an active fault in terms of estimating the average expected recurrence period for rupturing episodes. Along the Baikal Rift faults the slip rate distributions are poorly understood. This study provides morphotectonic and paleoseismological analyses of the Kichera Fault that stretches within the North Baikal Rift over a length of 100 km. Exposure ages of key displaced terraces of the Neruchanda River from in-situ produced cosmogenic 10Be depth profiles show that the highest terrace T5 is older than 315 ka, intermediate terrace T3 was abandoned 100.0 \u00b1 30 ka ago and the lowest terrace T1 is as old as 48.3 \u00b1 19.9 ka. These exposure ages, coupled with terrace elevation from the actual Neruchanda River bed, allow us to estimate the incision rates for the corresponding time periods which are 0.1 (maximum), 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.19 \u00b1 0.08 mm yr\u22121, respectively. Using the cumulated amplitudes of the terrace displacement, we estimate the vertical slip rates along the Kichera Fault are 0.42 \u00b1 0.13 and 0.19 \u00b1 0.08 mm yr\u22121 over the last ~100 ka and ~48.3 ka, respectively. Paleoseismological studies including morphomertic analyses of the tectonic scarp and trenching across the fault allowed estimating the age (5.4 ka) and minimum magnitude (6.8) of the last Kichera Fault rupture. Using the estimates of short- and long-term slip rates, we propose mean recurrence intervals of 5.3 and 2.4 ka, respectively. The last interval is shorter than the time since the last earthquake, indicating that the future event could be of greater magnitude to maintain the long-term average slip rate.\n               ","220":"\n                  Three-dimensional (3D) pre-stack depth migrated seismic data are used to analyse the geometry and growth of shallow faults associated with tectonic shortening in four (4) prominent thrust anticlines off Nankai, SE Japan. The four thrust anticlines show a trenchward increase in horizontal shortening and deform the seafloor at present. They shortened the overburden strata by 7143\u00a0m in the Late Quaternary, reflecting a horizontal shortening of 32.9% in response to plate subduction. A significant number of closely spaced and segmented fault arrays is observed in their hinge regions. Vertically segmented fault arrays with local throw maxima between 5 and 14\u00a0m relate to the existence of more competent (strong) intervals, or layers. Incompetent (weak) intervals record relatively small throw values between 2 and 5\u00a0m. We show that the presence of closely spaced, segmented fault arrays at shallow stratigraphic levels can have a significant impact on local stress distribution, controlling near-seafloor strain in accretionary prisms as Nankai's. The observed mechanical layering is likely to continue at depth to control the accumulation of tectonic stress in faults posed to reactivate during seismic events.\n               ","221":"\n                  The spatial and temporal interaction of rifting at the northern South China Sea (SCS) margin and shearing along Red River Fault Zone (RRFZ) is crucial to understanding the regional geodynamics. Their obscure relationship has led to controversial models for the origin of the Beibu Gulf basin within the northeast edge of the SCS. Newly released seismic-reflection data and well logs permit a new comprehensive analysis of the tectono-sedimentary history, which provides important constraints on the basin-forming history. Based on the interpretation of 3D multi-channel seismic data, we analyzed the seismic stratigraphy, fault development and tectonic subsidence, with additional confirmation from analogue modelling. The results suggest that several key unconformities separate the rifting history of North subbasins into three distinct phases. The syn-depositional faults and depocenters experienced a tectonic transition from NE- to NNE-orientated during the first two stages. The extensional structures were overprinted by the conjugate strike-slip faulting during stage III (30\u201323\u00a0Ma), as evidenced by the NEE-trending predominant faults and reactivation of NW-trending blind faults. Together with other regional geologic records and plate reconstruction history, we propose an updated view of the region's tectonic history. The NE-trending rift system initiated at the beginning of the Cenozoic. Tectonic reconfiguration at ~40\u00a0Ma induced a regional change of stress field to become north-south stretching that caused a tectonic transition of the basin. Influenced by the regional shearing activity of the RRFZ as well as additional north-south stretching, the basin was reworked by widespread strike-slip deformation. We therefore emphasize that while the basin's overall architecture was defined by the development of NE-trending rifts, both reconfiguration of the stress field acting on pre-existing faults and strike-slip reactivation of blind faults led to the basin's current intricate structure.\n               ","222":"\n                  With the increasing size and complexity of geoscientific databases, statistical tools and machine learning algorithms are needed to highlight subtle patterns within dense data clouds and reduce human-related bias in geological mapping. This study presents a new tool that maps structural complexity using circular variance and spherical dispersion in two Archean greenstone belts near Dryden and Timmins in the Superior Province, Ontario. Structural complexity quantitatively highlights areas where structures are folded, juxtaposed, and\/or parallel. Bedding measurements and autodetected aeromagnetic lineaments are used as inputs to test if structural complexity can refine or add confidence to existing geological interpretations. Linear, low variance trends frequently delineate the location and extent of deformation zones, which likely reflect parallel transposed fabrics in high strain corridors. Areas of high variance spatially correlate with fold traces. Sharp boundaries between high and low variance anomalies are interpreted as faults and\/or shear zones that juxtapose structural blocks. The near continuous and representative nature of autodetected magnetic lineaments was effective in capturing structural complexity at a regional scale; however, spherical dispersion captured the highest resolution of structural complexity at local scales (<1:30000). Key considerations when performing structural complexity analysis are scale, data density, and optimization of input parameters (e.g., neighborhood radius, lineament length, minimum neighborhood populations). Gold deposits are found <~1700\u00a0m from low (< \u03bc - 1\u03c3) and\u00a0<\u00a0~1500\u00a0m from high circular variance anomalies (> \u03bc\u00a0+\u00a01\u03c3). Additionally, the gold grade of large deposits (> 1 Moz) increases with proximity to high variance anomalies.

How the collision-induced crustal shortening is accomondated in the Tian Shan region, however, remains debated. Some of the shortening is clearly accommodated by the piedmont fold-and-thrust belts; but the role of deformation in the interior of the orogen, and the overall pattern of crustal deformation in the Tian Shan region, differs in previous studies. We have used NeoKinema, a kinematic finite-element computer code, to analyze the long-term average rates of strain and its partitioning in the Tian Shan region. The model is constrained by updated kinematic data sets, including fault traces, geological fault slip rates, GPS site velocities, principal stress directions, and kinematic boundary conditions. Our results indicate that, in addition to shortening in the piedmont fold-and-thrust belts, significant shortening and strike-slip faulting have occurred in the interior of the Tian Shan orogen. The intra-orogen strain is concentrated north of the Nalati Fault, around the intramontane basins. The overall pattern of crustal deformation in the Tian Shan region is pure shear shortening, facilitated by NEE-trending sinistral and NW-NWW trending dextral strike-slip faults that cut across the mountain ranges.

At subduction inception, the originally N-S trending northern Norfolk\/New Caledonia Ridge was moving northward as recorded by sheared lower Eocene dykes of the Peridotite Nappe. Fast exhumation of the fore-arc mantle in transtensional conditions was recorded by the injection of fore-arc magmas through fast-cooling peridotites, followed by the occurrence of antigorite- and tremolite-bearing crack seals in small-scale transcurrent or oblique-slip faults. Meanwhile, slices of the oceanic crust of the lower plate were scrapped off and accumulated in the fore-arc region while some elements were dragged down into the subduction zone and contributed to the formation of eclogite facies m\u00e9lange. When the tip of the New Caledonia Ridge reached the trench, it progressively jammed the subduction. Meanwhile, the oblique slip and coeval rotation of the arc due to the opening of the north Loyalty back-arc basin provoked the dextral transcurrent folding of already accreted ocean crust slices and metamorphic units on the course of exhumation. Bulk counterclockwise rotation of 56\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00b0 was recorded in the foreland basin by paleomagnetic data of sediments from the 45\u201335\u00a0Ma time interval.

Detailed structural analysis along the ~400\u00a0km long Jinhe-Qinghe thrust belt (JQTB) indicates post Late Eocene thrust motion with a minor left-lateral component, inducing ~0.6 to 3.6\u00a0km of apparent vertical offset across the fault. The exhumation history of the Baishagou granite, based on thermal modeling of new apatite (UTh)\/He and fission-track results, suggests an accelerated exhumation rate (~0.4\u00a0km\/Myr) between 20 and 16\u00a0Ma, corresponding to ~1.7\u20132.4\u00a0km of exhumation. We interpret this fast exhumation as a manifestation of the activation of the Nibi thrust, a northern branch of the JQTB, resulting in the creation of significant relief across the JQTB in the Early Miocene. When compared with previous studies, our findings show that Cenozoic exhumation and relief creation in southeastern Tibet cannot be explained by a single mechanism. Rather, at least three stages of relief creation should be invoked. The first phase is Eocene NE-SW compression partly coeval with Eocene sedimentation. During the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene and coeval with the extrusion of Indochina, the second thrusting phase occurred along the Yulong and Longmenshan thrust belts, and then migrated to the JQTB at 20\u201316\u00a0Ma. The third phase involved the activation of the Xianshuihe fault and the re-activation of the Longmenshan thrust belt and the Muli thrust.

The shallow strike-slip seismicity is generally associated with the north-south trending fracture zones of the basins, which segment the subducting lithosphere into eight main compartments named A-H. Strike-slip earthquakes with magnitudes higher than 4.5 Mw in the time period of 2004\u20132019 are examined with respect to the thickness and density of the subducting lithosphere, estimated from the lithospheric age.

Considering the available seismic records from the past four decades, a prominent cluster of strike-slip earthquakes is observed along Fracture Zone B-C, which displays a strong subductability contrast, whereas other fracture zones displaying only minor seismicity correspond to low subductability contrasts. Despite a high subductability contrast, slab tearing on the subducting Investigator Fracture Zone between Compartments G and H prevents the generation of strike-slip earthquakes.

We show that slip on the Mai'iu Fault has persisted at cm\/year rates since the onset of extension, making it one of Earth's most rapidly slipping continental LANF. Integrating temperature estimates from FT and (U-Th)\/He thermochronometry and RSCM, we calculated a down-dip, fault-parallel paleo-field temperature gradient along the now-exhumed part of the Mai'iu Fault of ~11\u00a0\u00b0C\/km. For a likely range of pre-extensional geothermal gradients in the Woodlark Rift (10\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C\/km), this paleo-field temperature gradient implies an average initial dip of the Mai'iu Fault of ~46\u00b0. Given the present dip of ~21\u00b0 at the surface, the thermal data reinforce other evidence that the footwall of the Mai'iu Fault has been back-rotated to the south by \u226520\u00b0 during progressive unroofing since fault inception, consistent with a rolling hinge style evolution of the SDMCC.\n               ","228":"\n                  With the purpose of exploring the widely distributed Mesozoic granitoids in SE China and the related mineralization, we carried out a new 530-km-long seismic wide-angle reflection and refraction (WARR) profile along the transect Wanzai- Hui'an. Based on a previous exploration in 2012 and the analysis of this WARR profile, we have deduced a detailed P-wave velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle. The main results are: (1) The crustal thickness is about 30 to 32\u00a0km beneath the Yangtze Block and West Cathaysia, and 29 to 30\u00a0km below the East Cathaysia, which represents a significant thinning with respect to the worldwide average thickness of shields and platforms. (2) The variation in seismic velocity between the upper crust and middle-lower crust in the Yangtze Block and the Cathaysia Blocks indicates that the Shaoxing-Jiangshan-Pingxiang Fault (SJPF) is the tectonic boundary between the Yangtze and Cathaysia and the Zhenghe-Dapu Fault (ZDF) is the tectonic boundary between the west and east Cathaysia. (3) The middle crust exhibits a low P-wave velocity layer of 6.2\u00a0km\/s below the Wuyishan Metallogenic Belt (WMB). This low velocity layer can be attributed to the delamination during the Caledonian orogeny and the Yanshanian extension. (4) The middle-lower crust shows a clear lateral velocity variation from west to east in Cathaysia. The subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate is believed to be the main reason for the extensional tectonic environment and magmatism during the Yanshanian (Jurassic-Cretaceous) period, leading to significant crustal and lithospheric thinning. Relatively high velocity in the middle-lower crust and widely disseminated Cretaceous volcanic rocks in East Cathaysia may be related to the slab rollback of the Paleo-Pacific plate in the late Yanshanian (Cretaceous) period.\n               ","229":"\n                  We present crustal scale physical analogue models of multiphase rifting to provide new constraints on the role exerted by faults formed during early extension on structures developed during later episodes of rifting. Our laboratory experiments (sand mixture is used to simulate the upper crust and PDMS-Corundum mixture is used to simulate the lower crust) are inspired by the Turkana depression in the East African Rift System, a natural case of rift zone developed through multiple extensional phases. The models reproduce a first rifting phase with NE-SW extension direction followed by a phase of W-E trending extension. In the experiments, we varied the amount of extension during the initial phase, which caused variations in the development and prominence of sets NW-SE normal faults, representing pre-existing faults to be potentially reactivated during the later rifting phase. Our model results indicate that the amount of extension in the early phase is critical in controlling the reactivation: the greater the amount of extension in the 1st-phase, the more important early faults are, and the easier these 1st-phase normal faults are reactivated during the 2nd-phase. At a local scale, fault reactivation may result in faults with a typical zigzag pattern, whose importance increases with the increase in the amount of extension during the early phase. Extrapolation of model results to the Turkana depression suggests that large-scale fault reactivation is unlikely to have occurred in the region, possibly implying that the Cretaceous-Early Paleogene extension was limited in the central part of Turkana depression. Results have been also extrapolated to other regions interested by multiphase rifting, such as basins in the North Sea rift.\n               ","230":"\n                  The 2017 Wulong earthquake (Ms 5.0) took place in Chongqing, China, causing serious damage to the local infrastructure. However, the mechanism of this earthquake is still unclear. We deployed a 155\u00a0km long magnetotelluric (MT) profile with 24 broadband sounding stations across the Wulong earthquake zone. The phase tensor and phase-out-of-quadrant data analysis show that the whole region is mainly characterized with 3-D electrical resistivity structure. High-quality full electrical resistivity impedances were inverted by a 3-D scheme to image the structure beneath the profile. The 3-D electrical resistivity model indicates that the dynamic environment of the central and eastern Chongqing and the Two Lakes plains is different from the neighboring areas. The different stress environment of the study area observed suggests that this area is prone to earthquakes. The Wulong earthquake (Ms 5.0) may have been generated by the local stress adjustment of the Qiyaoshan basement fault.\n               ","231":"\n                  We performed a suite of experiments aimed at examining the frictional properties of unaltered basalts at conditions considered to be representative of slip at shallow depths in volcano-tectonic environments and in-situ geo-energy basaltic sites. Scientific drilling and field studies on exhumed subsurface faults and fractures analogues suggest that, frictional sliding in basalts can occur in shear zones within a volume of wear debris or along localized joint surfaces. To illuminate how microstructural heterogeneities affect the nucleation of slip instabilities in basalts, we sheared simulated fault gouge and bare rock surfaces at low normal stresses (4\u201330\u00a0MPa) at ambient temperature, under room-dry and wet conditions. We performed velocity steps (0.1\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) and slide-hold-slides (30\u20133000\u00a0s holds) to determine the frictional stability and healing properties of basalts. In all the tests, we observed high friction coefficient associated with important frictional restrengthening. Overall, our results show that microstructural heterogeneities strongly affect the friction velocity dependence of basalts: while for normal stresses \u226510\u00a0MPa, shear localization accompanied by cataclasis and grain size reduction favors the transition to velocity weakening behavior of powdered samples, on bare surfaces gouge production during shearing promotes a transition to a velocity strengthening behavior. Our results imply that at the tested conditions, friction instabilities may promptly nucleate in shear zones where deformation within (unaltered) basaltic gouge layers is localized, such as those located along volcanic flanks, while joint surfaces characterized by rough rock-on-rock contacts are less prone to unstable slip, which is suppressed at velocities \u226510\u00a0\u03bcm\/s.\n               ","232":"\n                  The Main Recent Fault (MRF) is a major active strike-slip fault system at the NE border of the Arabian platform and Central Iran. Both geometry and kinematics of the fault system is rather well known along its central part and at its SE termination, while its possible continuation to the northwest is ambiguous. Moreover, less regard has been paid to possible relationships between this major intracontinental fault system and other strike-slip faults in NW Iran \u2013 SE Anatolia. This paper investigates both the structural pattern and kinematics of deformation in the region to the north of latitude 37\u00b0N, between the North Tabriz Fault and the MRF. We followed this goal through detailed fault mapping, structural field measurements, and fault-slip analyses, complemented by the reconstruction of cumulative geomorphic offsets along the main fault segments. The collected data sets have led us to propose a new tectonic model for the northwest corner of the Arabia \u2013 Central Iran collision zone. Our results reveal that the intracontinental dextral shear between Arabia-Central Iran, which is mainly localized along the MRF, continues to the north of latitude 37\u00b0N along a branch of the Neotethyan suture penetrating into SE Anatolia. The dextral fault system abruptly dies out at latitude 37.5\u00b0 N joining two NNW-striking normal fault zones, which accommodate the dextral translation of Central Iran relative to Arabia through ESE-trending extension. The region in NW Iran and SE Anatolia is affected by a heterogeneous active stress field due to different tectonic processes such as tectonic escape, block translation, and localized extension. The dynamics of these processes is either directly governed by the Arabia \u2013 Eurasia oblique convergence or indirectly controlled by frontal collision and pure shear deformation in central Anatolia.\n               ","233":"\n                  Fracturing and damage around faults related to seismogenesis can enhance hydrothermal fluid percolation, causing mineral precipitation. This study uses hydrothermally sealed microfractures across an ancient exhumed fault to unravel the 3D-spatial distribution of fault damage and related anisotropy in permeability. We studied the fault damage zone of the Jorgillo Fault, a left-lateral strike-slip fault, exposed by ca. 20\u00a0km in the Atacama Fault System, northern Chile. The study was conducted by addressing the 3D-spatial distribution of the microfracture network through X-ray micro-computed tomography and palaeopermeability modeling using a computational fluid dynamic approach, thus assessing mm-scale fault-related permeability tensors. 3D modeled fault-directed permeability ellipsoids on both sides of the fault core are transverse anisotropic, where palaeopermeability (matrix permeability) in the fault-parallel plane is higher than across-strike of the Jorgillo Fault (2.4 and 1.9 times in the eastern and western block of the fault, respectively). Modeled 3D permeability values (ca. 10\u221211 to 10\u221215\u00a0m2) show a mean overestimation factor of 8.4 of the estimated 2D permeability (ca. 10\u22129 to 10\u221212\u00a0m2). Permeability anisotropy distribution in the damage zone is related to off-fault damage generation, and could be explained by tip propagation fault growth and dynamic rupture due to earthquakes under the fault-valve mechanism. Whereas the fault would act as an impermeable seal except for post-failure, when it became highly permeable for fluids.\n               ","234":"\n                  Determining the fault displacement rates and the sequence of formation of intra-rift structures are essential aspects in the study of the evolution of intracontinental rifts. To better understand the development of the Tunka system of basins (Baikal Rift) and the influence of tectonics on landscape evolution, we conducted a morphometric analysis of the Tunka Fault and its transverse drainage network. We studied geomorphic parameters of 64 facets and 74 drainage basins within the Tunka mountain-front in the footwall of the Tunka Fault; these parameters include mountain front sinuosity, the ratio of facet height and width to base length, basin shape, hypsometric integral, asymmetry factor, and the valley width to height ratio. Our main objectives were to determine long-term throw rates for specific mountain front segments and estimate the timing of corresponding geomorphic structures, to characterize the geomorphological response of the transverse drainage systems to fault movements, and to understand the relationship between the morphometry and kinematics of different segments along the Tunka Fault. The analysis of the Tunka mountain front reveals evidence for strong tectonic control on its morphology. We found that the morphological features are strongly influenced by the Late Pleistocene \u2013 Holocene kinematic inversion along the eastern part of the Tunka Fault. The Late Pliocene\u2013Quaternary throw rates estimated for specific geomorphic structures vary in the range of 0.8\u20131.0\u00a0mm\u00a0year\u22121, which is compatible overall with the long-term throw rates of other basins of the Baikal Rift. Based on these rates, we estimate the age of fault-controlled subsidence of the Tunka and Khoytogol basins and Nilovsky Spur to be between 3.5 and 1.5\u00a0Ma. We also show that geomorphological response of the transverse drainage varies along the Tunka Fault, indicating a close relationship between fault kinematics and landscape response.\n               ","235":"\n                  Young and tectonically active chains like the Central Apennines (Italy) are featured by high structural complexity as a result of the overprint of subsequent deformational stages, making interpretation of seismotectonics challenging.\n                  The Central Apennines are characterized by the stacking of tectono-sedimentary units organized in thrust sheets. However, extensional tectonics is currently affecting the axial sector of the thrust belt, mostly expressing in extensional earthquakes.\n                  Using a large subsurface dataset acquired for hydrocarbon exploration in the region struck by the 2016\u20132017 Central Italy seismic sequence, we built a comprehensive 3D geological model and compared it with the seismicity.\n                  The model primarily shows a series of thrusts developed during the Miocene-Pliocene Apennines orogenesis and inherited normal faults developed during the Mesozoic extensional phase and the Miocene foreland flexural process. These normal faults were segmented and transported within the thrust sheets, and sometimes they still show a clear surface expression.\n                  The succession of tectonic stages resulted in a widespread reactivation of inherited structures, sometimes inverting their kinematics with different styles and rates, and disarticulating pre-existing configurations.\n                  Such evolution has a strong impact on the seismicity observed in the area, as demonstrated by some examples that show how the seismicity is aligned on segments of inherited faults, both compressional and extensional. Their reactivation can be explained by their favorable orientation within the current extensional stress field.\n                  Results feed the debate about the seismogenic potential of faults identified both at depth and surface, which can impact the seismic hazard of the Apennines.\n               ","236":"\n                  As one of the most prominent deformation features on Tibetan plateau, a series of N-S systematic rifts and V-shaped conjugate strike-slip faults are well developed in central-southern Tibet. However the mechanism for the formation of the rifts and conjugate strike-slip faults is still controversial. An east-west trending magnetotelluric (MT) array has been operated across the Gyaring Co Fault (GCF) at the northern end of the Xainza-Dingjye Rift (XDR) in Lhasa block. Three-dimensional (3-D) inversions are employed to image lithospheric resistivity structure. Combined with the previous north-south MT 3-D inversion result, electrical resistivity models reveal obvious conductive layer in the mid-to-lower crust beneath the XDR and apparent resistivity change in the vicinity of the GCF. The calculated depth-integrated conductivity shows that the weak mid-to-lower crust (~30\u00a0km-\u00a0~\u00a060\u00a0km) characterized by high conductance (\u2265 ~10,000\u00a0S) and melt fraction of ~5\u201313%, is mainly distributed between the Indus-Yarlung suture (IYS) and the GCF, whereas the relatively rigid crust characterized by low conductance (\u2264 ~2000\u00a0S) and melt fraction of ~2\u20134% appears to the northeast of the GCF. The weak mid-to-lower crust in southern Tibet and the abrupt difference in the resistivity characteristics of the mid-to-lower crust in the vicinity of the GCF, suggest the formation of the rifts in Lhasa block is closely associated with the weak mid-to-lower crust. Taken together with the upper mantle seismic features, the weak mid-to-lower crust is believed to be attributed to the underplated Indian plate. An alternative geodynamic model is presented to respond to the eastward extrusion during the ongoing N-S convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates, that the rigid crust in central Tibet is sandwiched by the weak mid-to-lower crust in southern and northern Tibet, and the rifts form above the weak mid-to-lower crust, whereas the conjugate strike-slip faults develop on the rigid crust in central Tibet.\n               ","237":"\n                  This study presents a detailed analysis of minor seismic sequences recorded in the Amatrice-Norcia area (central Italy) before 2016 when the most important seismic sequence of the last 40\u00a0years struck the region with the Mw 6.0 Amatrice and the Mw 6.5 Norcia earthquakes. We observe that, in the four decades before the 2016\u20132018 Amatrice-Visso-Norcia sequence, the instrumental seismicity rate is low, with maximum magnitudes lower than Mw 4.0, and is characterized by different types of behaviours as single shock events, swarms and minor sequences. For the first time, we relocate the minor seismicity recorded before 2016 by the Italian National Seismic Network of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia by applying the nonlinear inversion code NonLinLoc in a local velocity model. Revised earthquake locations of the past seismic sequences are compared to the recent 2016\u20132018 seismicity in order to investigate some possible correlations with the seismogenic structures reactivated in 2016. With this goal, we also integrated our new hypocentral locations with fault plane solutions and geological data to interpret our results with respect to the 2016\u20132018 seismicity. Our results show how some of the structures identified by the minor seismicity before 2016 were reactivated during the recent sequence, while others seismic structures remained silent.

While strong earthquakes have occurred on the east and west sides of the Taiwan Strait and their seismotectonic are relatively well understood, the earthquake risk and seismogenic structure in the strait still need more investigations. On November 25, 2018, a rare moderately strong earthquake with a magnitude of Mw5.8 occurred inside the strait, and it caused broad ground motions in the near regions. From the waveform inversion of the seismic data, this earthquake is found to be a high-dip angle strike-slip event, with the two nodal planes striking east-west (EW) and north-south (NS) directions. As there are mapped faults striking EW and NS in the epicentral region, further studies are needed to determine the ruptured fault plane. To determine the ruptured fault plane, we analyzed the rupture directivity of the mainshock with the relative location between the hypocenter and the centroid. We chose several M4+ aftershocks as reference events and relocated the reference earthquakes with the Pn travel time difference. Then, we used regional waveform data to invert centroid location and source parameters of earthquakes. Thereafter, we estimated the strike of the mainshock ruptured fault and rupture length, via fitting the azimuthal variation of the Love wave time shift difference between the mainshock and the reference earthquakes. Our results showed that the mainshock ruptured along NS strike with the rupture length about 3.6\u20135.6\u00a0km. Combined with the tectonics, we inferred that the seismogenic fault is the Dongshan uplift eastern fault (DSEF) and the 1994 event may promote the occurrence of the 2018 Mw5.8 earthquake.\n               ","239":"\n                  Continental normal fault earthquakes have been reported to have smaller maximum magnitudes (M\n                     \n                        max\n                     ) than continental earthquakes with other fault geometries.

In extension, lithosphere is weaker, failing at lower yield stresses than in compression. Although this yield stress difference is consistent with smaller continental normal fault earthquakes, it appears inconsistent with the occurrence of large oceanic normal fault earthquakes. However, the largest oceanic normal fault earthquakes occur near subduction zones where the lithosphere is bending. Laboratory studies indicate that bending lithosphere likely has a higher yield stress than lithosphere in pure extension, which may allow for larger oceanic normal fault earthquakes.

These simulations aim to reproduce the well-documented field observations of curved slickenlines that formed during coseismic fault displacement at the ground surface. We consider relatively simple dynamic rupture models with a dipping fault embedded into a homogeneous or layered elastic halfspace. Among a wide range of model parameters tested, we find a model with shallow (<1.5km) low-velocity layers derived from a regional 3D velocity model combined with a depth-dependent prestress result in curved slip trajectories that closely match slickenline observations. This same model also generates a slip distribution and rupture propagation direction consistent with published inversions constrained by seismological and geodetic data. Furthermore, the characteristics of slickenline curvature are consistent with theoretically predicted earthquake rupture direction. Unlike previous theoretical studies, coseismic changes in rake angle occur due to the emergence of multiple slip fronts within the shallow low-velocity medium.

Thermo-mechanical models generate detachments that either transect the lithosphere or become distributed shear zones in the mid-lower crust, depending on prescribed thermo-rheological conditions. However, these geometries and prescribed conditions remain little constrained by geology-based reconstructions. We present stepwise, balanced reconstructions of a 160\u202fkm-long cross-section through two detachment faults in the southwest USA. Reconstructions form the basis of iteratively improved 2D forward thermo-kinematic numerical simulations of detachment fault slip, footwall exhumation, heat advection, and footwall zircon (U-Th)\/He cooling ages. Thermo-kinematic model solutions are calibrated iteratively against surface heat flow, pre- and post-extensional geotherms, inferred Moho temperatures, and thermochronometric data from one detachment footwall. Best-fit models predict the thermal and geometric evolution of the crust and detachments, respectively, during extension. The detachment initially rooted into a mid-crustal shear zone (~7.5\u201312\u202fkm depth) and was probably delocalized in the deep middle crust (>12\u201315\u202fkm). The maximum principal stress was likely non-vertical in the middle crust at detachment initiation, possibly due to mantle upwelling. Our reconstructions suggest that the upper crust and lower crust-mantle lithosphere were decoupled by a weak, mid-crustal layer during early detachment faulting. The weak layer was thinned, cooled, partially embrittled, and therefore strengthened by continued detachment slip. This increased lithospheric mechanical coupling and caused the locus of upper-crustal extension to shift. Thinning of a weak mid-crustal layer, as is thought to precede coupled hyperextension and mantle exhumation during rifting, was mostly complete in our study area by ~7\u20136\u202fMa.\n               ","242":"\n                  We present an electrical resistivity model obtained from a 2D Magnetotelluric survey across a large sector of the Southern Apennine in the High Agri Valley (HAV), a NW-SE trending intra-mountain basin, with a high seismogenic potential. The intensive hydrocarbon exploitation (Val d'Agri oilfield) makes this area also affected by induced seismicity. In this HAV sector, the injection of salt-water in an unproductive disposal well (Costa Molina 2) causes localized swarms of microearthquakes; a second cluster of continuous induced seismicity is also observed SW of the Pertusillo Lake and it is associated to the seasonal fluctuations of the reservoir's water level.\n                  The major insight inferred from this study concerns a better understanding of the geological and tectonic framework in the HAV. The electrical resistivity model images the subsurface as conductive sedimentary sequences (Allochthonous Units) upon the carbonate Apulian Platform Unit characterized by higher resistivity values. Both these units appear composed of thrust-and-fold system deepening with larger wavelength anticlines N-E toward. Most of the structures identified in the magnetotelluric model are rather superficial and confined within the Allochthonous Units. A sudden break of the Apulian platform under the central part of the MT profile defines a conductive zone possibly associated to a major SW-dipping reverse fault or to several branches, as closely spaced thrust-sheets cutting eastern flanks of the Agri Valley.\n                  Additional information on the HAV deep structures comes from the joint interpretation of the resistivity model and a 3D seismic tomographic model obtained from the inversion of passive seismic data collected in the period 2002\u20132018. The availability of this elastic representation of the subsurface allowed us to perform a cluster analysis on the electrical resistivity and seismic P-wave velocity distribution within the subsoil.

In this study, we consider factors responsible for a cluster of earthquakes on the Bear River fault zone (BRF), a recently activated, 44-km-long normal fault on the eastern margin of Basin and Range extension in the Rocky Mountains. The entire surface-rupturing history of the BRF, as gleaned from paleoseismic and geomorphic observations, began only 4500\u00a0years ago and consists of at least three large events. Rupture of the BRF is spatially complex and is clearly conditioned by preexisting structure. In particular, where the south end of the fault intersects older thrust faults and upturned strata along the south-dipping flank of the Precambrian basement-cored Uinta arch, the main trace ends abruptly in a set of orthogonal splays that accommodate down-dropping of a large hanging-wall graben against the arch. We hypothesize that the geomechanically strong Uinta arch crustal block impeded the development of the BRF and, over time, enabled a significant accumulation of elastic strain energy, eventually giving rise to a pulse of strain release in the mid- to late Holocene. We surmise that variations in fault strength, both in space and time, is a cause of earthquake clustering on the BRF and on other faults that are structurally and tectonically immature. The first two earthquakes on the BRF occurred during the same period of time as a regional cluster of earthquakes in the Middle Rocky Mountains, suggesting that isolated faults in this slowly extending region interact through widespread changes in stress conditions.\n               ","244":"\n                  The margins of the Tibetan Plateau are the most recent evolving part of the orogen, where distributed fault systems accumulate intraplate crustal deformation induced by the Indo-Asian collision, and many great earthquakes occur.

However, until now, few paleoseismic studies were conducted along the northern Tibetan margin, which hampers our understanding of fault activity and seismic hazards posed to the densely populated cities in the region. In this study, we excavated paleoseismic trenches across the Fodongmiao-Hongyazi fault (FHF) along the northern Tibetan margin. Five Holocene events were documented from five trenches based on OSL and radiocarbon-14 dating of trench horizons and careful analysis of stratigraphy and fault structures. These events are FE5 (9.6\u20137.7\u00a0ka), FE4 (7.6\u20137.0\u00a0ka), FE3 (4.4\u20133.5\u00a0ka), FE2 (3.2\u20131.8\u00a0ka), and the 1609\u00a0M 71\/4 Hongyapu earthquake. The average recurrence interval of the five events is ~2.0\u00a0ka. Additionally, combined with morphotectonic features and trench observations, the 1609 Hongyapu earthquake most likely caused the whole fault to rupture with a length of ~95\u00a0km. Its moment magnitude was estimated to be 7.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 based on empirical statistical relationships between the magnitude, surface rupture length, and coseismic offset.\n               ","245":"\n                  The study of the Cordillera de Domeyko and the Salar de Atacama Basin in northern Chile has been critical to understand the generation of the Andean Cordillera and the migration of the deformation front eastwards. However, the relation between the uplift of the range, its temporal pattern, and the formation of the Preandean Depression have not been fully understood. In this article, we forward modeled two gravimetry surveys, consisting in 185 stations crossing the boundary between the Salar de Atacama Basin and Cordillera de Domeyko, with the goal of understanding the physical traits of each domain and the variations in basin geometry. We interpreted two seismic reflection profiles, along with log data from one well in the basin center, and additionally, we analyzed an inversion of the magnetic anomaly for both lines. The results of the analysis show the segmentation of physical properties into two domains. The first is interpreted as basement (Triassic-older) units, while the other shows the presence of gravity lows correlated with late Mesozoic-Cenozoic units cropping out along the western edge of the basin. The magnetic anomalies identified were correlated with variations within the basement and outcrops of crystalline intrusives. Within the sedimentary units, the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene Purilactis Group and Paleogene-Eocene formations were distinguished from the evaporite-rich Oligocene-Miocene Paciencia Group. The latter was deposited after a compressive event (Incaic Event) which thrusted basement units eastwards, inverted Mesozoic extensional faults, and generated the accommodation space required for its deposition. The basin then experienced renewed compression during the Miocene. This interplay between basement uplift and thrusting, along with fault inversion and basin generation, is a characteristic found in other parts of the Salar de Atacama Basin and the orogen, suggesting that this tectonic style might be prevalent in other basins comprising the Preandean Depression and along the Central Andes.\n               ","246":"\n                  This study uses Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data to investigate the source model of the 26 November 2019 Albania earthquake, the largest earthquake to hit the northwestern region of the country in the last century. The preferred InSAR-based coseismic slip model shows that the slip is distributed in a relatively narrow area and is located at a depth of ~11\u00a0km with a maximum amplitude of ~0.89\u00a0m. The estimated geodetic moment of this earthquake is 3.70\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01018\u00a0Nm, with a shear modulus of 40\u00a0GPa, which is equivalent to Mw 6.31. The preferred slip model shows that this earthquake ruptured an east-dipping fault, namely the Shijak Fault wherein the primary slip mechanism is the dip-slip motion. Two-dimensional (2.5-D) surface displacement derived from three pairs of InSAR data is used to ensure the dip direction of the seismogenic fault responsible for the 2019 Albania earthquake. The result of 2.5-D displacement shows the dominance of the westward and uplift motion with a maximum amplitude of ~0.1\u00a0m.

However, the relation between frictional strength, fault stability, mineralogical composition, and fabric of fault gouge, composed of strong and weak minerals, is poorly constrained. We used a biaxial apparatus to systematically shear different mixtures of shale (68% clay, 23% quartz and 4% plagioclase) and calcite, as powdered gouge, at room temperature, under constant normal stresses of 30, 50, 100\u00a0MPa and under room-dry and pore fluid-saturated conditions, i.e. CaCO3-equilibrated water. We performed 30 friction experiments during which velocity-stepping and slide-hold-slide tests were employed to assess frictional stability and to measure frictional healing, respectively. Our frictional data indicate that the mineralogical composition of fault gouges significantly affects frictional strength, stability, and healing as well as the presence of CaCO3-equilibrated water. Under room-dry condition, the increasing shale content determines a reduction in frictional strength, from \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.71 to \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.43, a lowering of the healing rates and a transition from velocity-weakening to velocity-strengthening behavior. Under wet condition, with increasing shale content we observe a more significant reduction in frictional strength (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.65\u20130.37), a near-zero healing and a velocity strengthening behavior. Microstructural investigations evidence a transition from localized deformation promoted by grain size reduction, in calcite-rich samples, to a more distributed deformation with frictional sliding along clay-enriched shear planes in samples with shale content greater than 50%. For faults cutting across sedimentary sequences composed of carbonates and clay-rich sediments, our results suggest that clay concentration and its ability to form foliated and interconnected networks promotes important heterogeneities in fault strength and slip behavior.\n               ","248":"\n                  The brittle deformation of internal zones of the Rif chain, corresponding to the southern margin of the West Alboran Basin, is not or poorly dated because of the lack of stratigraphic constraints.

In addition, (UTh)\/He apatite ages from both units have been measured. They are younger in the hangingwall (~20\u201321\u00a0Ma) than in the footwall (14\u201319\u00a0Ma), which highlights slightly different cooling histories. Thus, we interpret the illite ages to date growth of authigenic illite (1M polytype) during exhumation through the top few kilometers of the earth's surface.\n                  This study of brittle deformation within the internal zones of the Rif chain reveals that an E-W directed extension occurred between ~18\u201315\u00a0Ma during the low temperature exhumation of Sebtide-Alpuj\u00e1rride units. From 15 to 11\u00a0Ma, the direction of extension shifted to NNW-SSE and only minor steep normal faults occurred. Brittle normal faulting occurred during a stage of slow cooling (~1\u20132\u00a0\u00b0C\/myr) starting at ~19\u00a0Ma and coeval with exhumation processes within the uppermost levels of the continental crust.

Former studies providing reconstructions of the fault systems activated during this sequence, are mostly based on high-resolution seismological and geodetic data. In this paper, we integrate surface and subsurface geological data with the ones obtained by an irregular network of seismic reflection profiles, aimed at providing a comprehensive reconstruction of the subsurface lithologies and structures in this area. We have constructed a set of five geological cross-sections, passing through the mainshock epicentral areas (Mw\u00a0>\u00a05.5) of the seismic sequence. The cross-sections are extrapolated down to a depth of ca. 12\u00a0km, along which we have plotted relocated seismicity. Combined geological and seismological data support a new 3D seismotectonic model, illustrating the propagation through time and space of the seismic ruptures during the sequence. Our results show that the litho-mechanical stratigraphy exerted a primary control on the distribution of seismicity, as it is mostly hosted in the more competent lithologies (i.e. the Late Triassic-Paleogene succession, consisting of carbonates and evaporites). In addition, we illustrate the crucial role played by the inherited compressional structures in determining the lateral and vertical variations of the rheological properties of the upper crust and, eventually, the overall geometry and segmentation of the seismogenic extensional system. The workflow proposed here can be applied to other seismogenic zones throughout the world, since reliable seismotectonic models require an accurate reconstruction of the subsurface geological setting, based on a close integration of geological, geophysical and seismological data.\n               ","250":"\n                  The Qilian Shan, located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, has been continuously extending to the foreland since the late Cenozoic, resulting in the deformation of the Hexi Corridor Basins. Five terraces of the Hongshui River are faulted in the southern Zhangye Basin, a sub-basin of the Hexi Corridor, documenting the tectonic history of the Minle Fault since the late Quaternary. In this study, a high precision digital elevation model (DEM) generated by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry is used to obtain the cumulative vertical offset of each terrace. And the abandonment ages of terraces are dated by AMS 14C dating.

The shortening rate of the Minle Fault could represent the deformation rate in the south margin of the Zhangye Basin. Geological and geodetic data indicate the shortening rates of the Zhangye Basin are steady in 104 and 10-year timescales. The deformation rate of the north Qilian fault-fold system (NQF) has not changed significantly since the late Quaternary and may be consistent with that in the 106-year timescale, although further studies are needed.\n               ","251":"\n                  Six destructive earthquakes occurred in the Dongpu Sag and surrounding regions from 1493 to 1983, and more recent earthquakes have also been concentrated in these areas. Relocation results show two active earthquake clusters in and around Dongpu Sag, one in the north and one in the south. However, the dynamic mechanisms leading to these earthquake clusters have not previously been established. In this study, we use seismic reflection profiles to develop a three-dimensional geometric model of the Lanliao Fault, which marks the eastern boundary of the Dongpu Sag. This model shows that the Lanliao Fault is a listric strike-slip fault on a regional scale. The northern fault segment is steep (>45\u00b0) at >8\u00a0km depth, while the southern segment becomes a gentle detachment below 8\u00a0km. Shallow seismic reflection profiles combined with analysis of borehole cores indicates that the northern segment of the fault appears to have reverse kinematics at <70\u201380\u00a0m depth. Earthquakes that occurred from 2008 to 2018 in the northern Dongpu Sag are controlled by the Lanliao Fault. A reduction in accommodation space and the presence of a restraining bend along the fault appear to be the main dynamic mechanisms associated with the northern earthquake cluster. The focal depths of the earthquake cluster near Heze City are deeper than those in the northern cluster, and relocated earthquakes and focal mechanism solutions show that the two clusters occur on different seismogenic faults.

The structural evolution of the basin is closely related to the coeval sedimentation of Neogene Fars Group foreland basin deposits. The analysis of five geological cross-sections reveals the interaction between tectonics, Gachsaran Formation diapirism and coeval sedimentation as well as the influence of hidden basement-involved faults. The great thickness of the Miocene Gachsaran evaporites contributes to the internal structure of the Dehdasht Basin as well as decouples the Competent Group structure at depth from the Passive Group structure cropping out at surface. The basin forms a synclinorium limited by high amplitude NW-SE trending anticlines filled with Neogene deposits. Its internal structure is characterized by relatively thin growth synclines-minibasins separated by Gachsaran diapiric ridges formed under a combination of shortening and diapirism. The amount of shortening across the basin ranges between 7.5 and 13.1\u00a0km (16\u201324%) whereas the restored preserved thickness of Gachsaran evaporites increases southeastwards from 2 to 2.85\u00a0km. This high thickness is interpreted as partly accumulated by gravity gliding from the rising surrounding anticlines. Observed changes in structural relief across and along the Dehdasht Basin suggests its development above an array of hidden and linked basement faults including segments of the Mountain Frontal Flexure with NW-SE Zagros trend under the northern and southern boundary anticlines and a transfer fault with N-S Arabian trends at the SE border. The observed structural variations both along-strike and across the Dehdasht Basin at a local scale are similar to those already found at larger scales along the major Kazerun Fault Zone.\n               ","253":"\n                  The northern Adamello batholith (European Southern Alps) is crosscut by E-W trending pseudotachylyte-bearing paleoseismic fault zones composed of multiple subparallel fault strands. The main faults are the Gole Strette Fault Zone (GSFZ), here discussed in detail, and the Gole Larghe Fault Zone (GLFZ). The western ending of the GSFZ intersects the propagation of the Gallinera Thrust, a regional structure of Late Cretaceous age, which was truncated and dismembered by the late Eocene - early Oligocene emplacement of the Adamello batholith. Fault slip analysis and paleostress reconstruction suggest that the GSFZ and the Gallinera Thrust were both active during dextral transpression related with Oligocene orogen-parallel shearing along the Periadriatic Fault System. The remnants of the Gallinera Thrust within the Adamello were reactivated as dextral-reverse faults and do not include pseudotachylytes. The pseudotachylyte-bearing GSFZ shows changing structural features from west to east: the fault dip angle decreases from 80\u00b0 to 45\u00b0, the slip vector passes from strike-slip (pitch of 20\u00b0) to oblique (pitch of 35\u00b0 to 45\u00b0), and the fault zone thickness increases (> 800\u00a0m at the intersection with the GLFZ). The GSFZ is an immature and strong fault as indicated by (i) the local geometry controlled by precursor joints; (ii) the along-strike segmentation; and (iii) the spread of seismogenic faults into wide fault zones.\n               ","254":"\n                  The Tanlu fault is the largest strike-slip fault in eastern China. It has experienced multiple episodes of tectonic activity suggested mostly by near-surface geological analysis. However, little evidence comes from deformation at different depths in the crust. This study presents a three-dimensional (3-D) high-resolution upper crustal azimuthally anisotropic model of shear-wave velocity beneath the Chao Lake segment of the Tanlu fault zone (TFZ-CL) using surface wave dispersion data (0.5\u201312\u00a0s) extracted from ambient seismic noise. The results show that fast directions of azimuthal anisotropy are consistent with local geological units, hence interpreted as shape-preferred orientations (SPO). A special depth-dependent anisotropic pattern is revealed beneath eastern Chao Lake, where the fast directions vary from nearly NE-SW at shallow depths, to NNE-SSW or nearly N-S at intermediate depths and back to NE-SW at great depths. The anisotropic model is combined with other previously published datasets to construct a deformation model at multiple depths. The deformation model suggests that lithospheric deformation is decoupled from the asthenosphere beneath the TFZ-CL, implying that the deep tectonic setting have changed dramatically since the Mesozoic. By connecting the new anisotropic model and the local tectonic episodes, we further propose a four-stage tectonic evolution model of the TFZ-CL. The model can well interpret the generation of anisotropies, especially the specific anisotropic pattern beneath eastern Chao Lake, providing new evidence of deformation at great depths to support the multistage tectonic episodes along the Tanlu fault.\n               ","255":"\n                  The Kumaon Himalaya lies in the central seismic gap and therefore bears the potential to host a great Himalayan earthquake.

The seismically active zone of the eastern segment of the Kumaon Himalaya deviates from the usual pattern of seismicity in the Himalayan Seismic Belt of the NW Himalaya. Shallow-focus earthquakes in this region largely concentrate in the Chiplakot Crystalline Belt (CCB) immediately south of the Vaikrita Thrust. The Focal Mechanism Solutions of 41 earthquakes computed through waveform inversion technique along with the solutions of 12 earthquakes obtained from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor solution catalog are used to investigate the kinematics of the region. The study reveals a complex faulting pattern in the Inner Lesser Himalaya. The stress inversion results show a widely distributed stress pattern and low frictional coefficient which are attributed as one of the major causes of clustered seismicity observed in the CCB. Careful examination of the fault orientations indicate the presence of a hinterland dipping Lesser Himalayan Duplex over the ramp structure on the Main Himalayan Thrust. The high compressive stress and deformation rate in the CCB are partially accommodated by this duplex structure. The large concentration of shallow-focus earthquakes in the CCB is the result of the presence of fluid-rich zone as well as strain localization and large stress build-up due to locking in the ramp structure on the Main Himalayan Thrust beneath the CCB.\n               ","256":"\n                  Turkey is a part of the Tethyan orogenic belt, which is one of the most tectonically active regions on Earth where the African, Eurasian, and Arabian plates interact with each other.

Our geological and geophysical observations, focal mechanism solutions of the earthquakes, and the National Geodetic Network (TUTGA)-based GPS strain analysis demonstrate that the whole triangle-shaped area between the major strike-slip fault zones is under the effect of the active northwest-southeast contractional tectonic regime. This conclusion is different than the previous studies which suggest an active extensional regime for the region. The reason of the contraction of the area between the major strike-slip fault zones could be a complex interaction between the nearly north-south contraction in eastern Anatolia and north-south extension in western Anatolia, and the westward movement and counterclockwise rotation of the Anatolian plate.\n               ","257":"\n                  Segment lengths along major strike-slip faults exhibit a size dependency related to the brittle crust thickness. These segments result in the formation of the localized \u201cP-shear\u201d deformation crossing and connecting the initial Riedels structures (i.e. en-echelon fault structures) which formed during the genesis stage of the fault zone. Mechanical models show that at all scales, the geometrical characteristics of the Riedels exhibit dependency on the thickness of the brittle layer. Combining the results of our mechanical discrete element model with several analogue experiments using sand, clay and gypsum, we have formulated a relationship between the orientation and spacing of Riedels and the thickness of the brittle layer. From this relationship, we derive that for a pure strike-slip mode, the maximum spacing between the Riedels is close to three times the thickness of the layer. For a transtensional mode, as the extensive component becomes predominant, the spacing distance at the surface becomes much smaller than the thickness. Applying this relationship to several well-characterized strike-slip faults on Earth, we show that the predicted brittle thickness is consistent with the seismogenic depth. Supposing the ubiquity of this phenomenon, we extented this relationship to characterize en-echelon structures observed on Mars, in the Memnonia region located West of Tharsis.

However, near surface observations pertaining to the top 15\u00a0km of the convergence zone show no evidence of an active subduction in the region. In this study, we investigate the seismic activity along the Antalya slab in order to constrain the mode of convergence and the geometry along this plate boundary. Towards this end, we obtain a new focal mechanism catalogue with reliable centroid depths for earthquakes Mw\u00a0>\u00a04 from regional waveforms by using path dependent seismic velocity models. Our results indicate that the subduction is still active along the plate boundary segment between Cyprus and Anaximander seamount. The earthquakes along the slab interface reveal a NE-dipping slab with a dip angle of ~35\u00b0. Slip vectors show a pure convergent motion which is consistent with relative motion of Anatolia with respect to Nubia. We also identify a number of intraslab earthquakes down to a depth of 120\u00a0km along the Antalya slab. The T-axis of intraslab earthquakes show down-dip extension consistent with negatively buoyant subducting slab. The Paphos fault bounds the Antalya slab to the east where previously large right-lateral earthquakes occurred, which marks the relative motion of the Antalya slab with respect to the eastern Cyprus slab. Based on slab isodepth contours of the slab interface, we calculate ~100\u00a0km offset between the 80\u00a0km depth contours of the Antalya and Cyprus slabs. The western boundary of the Antalya slab possibly lies between the Anaximander and Anaximenes seamounts, where several left-lateral earthquakes are obtained.

NE\u2013SW secondary faults are abundant at the regional scale, even away from the T\u00eat fault. Major NW\u2013SE faults are constituted by 10s-m wide brittle core zones, and NW\u2013SE secondary faults are concentrated around the T\u00eat fault, attesting that they had formed at shallow crust levels after the Oligo-Miocene extension. N\u2013S fractures, formed during Pyrenean compression, are part of the background fracturing and are scattered throughout the study area. Intersections of fault and fracture networks provide efficient permeable pathways for meteoric and hydrothermal fluids.

All of these elements are integrated in a global model of the hydrothermal system establishment in accordance with the faulting sequence, with the damage distribution and with the lithology. This distributed fault system could represent the surface expression of the crustal thinning revealed by recent geophysical data.

The early Cenozoic event in central NCC was coeval with an event occurring throughout eastern Asia and may have been a regional response to changes in the movement direction and velocity of the Pacific Plate, and this event may have resulted in the formation of rift basins in the eastern NCC.

Previous studies have shown that the stress state is characterized by a strike-slip faulting stress regime with ENE\u2013WSW maximum compression, NNW\u2013SSE minimum compression, and vertical intermediate stress. The differential stress magnitudes are estimated to be on the order of 100\u00a0MPa under the assumption of the strong-fault earthquake with a high Coulomb friction coefficient of 0.85. Conversely, other studies have shown that the weak-fault model is applicable across the Japanese Archipelago, where the differential stress level is only a few tens of MPa. We, therefore, review previous studies, evaluate the focal mechanism data across the Korean Peninsula, and infer the absolute stress level. Our comparison of the geological and tectonic histories of the Korean Peninsula and Japanese Archipelago suggests that the NNW\u2013SSE tensional stresses in the Korean Peninsula are caused by slab rollback of the Philippine Sea Plate at around 5\u00a0Ma, west of Kyushu Island, southwestern Japan. We also find that the earthquake faulting types across the Korean Peninsula are closely related to their fault strikes, confirming a spatially uniform distribution of the strike-slip stress regime with nearly equal tensional and compressional tectonic stresses. However, this situation leads to the apparent paradox of strike-dependent fault strength. We eliminate this paradox by proposing a model whereby reverse- and normal-faulting events are caused by local stress heterogeneities around the edges of strike-slip faults under a uniform low-strength strike-slip stress state for all faulting types. We also highlight the usefulness of strike\u2013rake and faulting-type indicator\u2013magnitude diagrams in considering stress states.\n               ","265":"\n                  We explore the shear-wave lithospheric velocity structure of the Eastern Caribbean and Northern Venezuela using ambient noise tomography with stations deployed around the study area.

These velocities are further projected onto 0.6\u00b0x0.6\u00b0 phase velocity grids for each period between 5 s and 50 s. The pseudo-dispersion curve at each grid point is inverted for 1D shear velocity profiles by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme. The interpolated 3D velocity model shows that the mean shear velocity of the Eastern Caribbean lithospheric mantle is lower than the global average, which is in agreement with values reported in other large igneous provinces. We interpret that low velocities in the lithospheric keel are associated with an anomalous composition and\/or an elevated thermal state; this gives the Caribbean plate a high buoyancy that determines the subduction polarities in the region. The results also indicate that: (a) the mantle beneath Northern Venezuela retains compositional anomalies related to extension processes of different ages; (b) the overriding of the Caribbean plate by the Great Antilles arc seems to be much slower than previously suggested; and (c) the localized volcanism in the center of the Lesser Antilles arc is related to asthenospheric flow through the tear induced on the subducted slab by major strike-slip faults.\n               ","266":"\n                  Numerical modeling of fault zone evolution and related seismicity can provide an insight into the process of large earthquake occurrences in a complicated fault system. In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional finite-difference numerical model of stress-strain evolution in and around the Chuya and Kurai depressions of Gorny Altai, Russia, to understand the fault zone evolution and the observed distribution of earthquakes in the region. Unlike in previous studies, the process of seismo-tectonic deformations of this region is addressed in a three-dimensional formulation with an improved model of rock massif behavior. A new geometrical model is designed, which is based on the seismotectonic, paleoseismological studies, and high-resolution Space-Radar-Topography-Mission data. The mathematical model applied here represents a set of partial differential equations, which are based on the fundamental conservation laws and constitutive equations for elastic and inelastic deformations. The initial stress state of the model is due to the action of gravity forces. The model is activated by assigning different displacement fields at the model boundaries \u2013 strike-slip and GPS-based displacements. The modeling results illustrate the stages of fault zone development and are in satisfactory agreement with the field observations in the case of GPS-based boundary conditions, which has not been modeled yet. Modeled seismic process is associated with the development of a fault zone resulting from the loss of strength in the subsurface points where the inelastic strain exceeds a certain threshold. The areas of high-degree of inelastic strain localization and the modeled fault zone represent an en-echelon system of dextral strike slips and various types of shear bands. The modeled seismic process obeys the Gutenberg-Richter (frequency-magnitude) law. The number of earthquakes in the attenuation part of the rock massif fracture process follows the Omori (aftershock decay) law.\n               ","267":"\n                  Detachment of the Baja California peninsula from the North American plate altered the crustal region between them, including an extension of the crust between the peninsula and Mexico's mainland.

Here we identify two additional, major discontinuities: one in gravity and the second in the regional electrical resistivity to 50-km depth, both associated with the region in which the crust changes from extended to un-extended. Under the former, we ratify and extend the presence of the oceanic slab obtained elsewhere with seismological determinations. Plate rollback is also reported in the boundary region. Gravity and electrical resistivity models locate the NW and SE limits of the rolled-back portion of the oceanic slab; within this region, we identify upwelling asthenospheric material.

High-resolution seismic velocity and attenuation tomography has imaged the subducting Pacific and Philippine Sea (PHS) slabs clearly. Low-velocity (low-V) and high-attenuation (low-Q) anomalies are revealed in the crust and mantle wedge beneath the volcanic front and back-arc areas, which reflect arc magmas produced by corner flow in the mantle wedge and slab dehydration. Low-V and low-Q zones in the forearc mantle wedge reflect mantle serpentinization due to abundant fluids from the young and warm PHS slab. Low-V anomalies appear below the PHS slab, which reflect upwelling flow in the big mantle wedge above the Pacific slab and may heat the PHS slab from below, causing aseismic PHS slab at depths >100\u00a0km under Shikoku and Chugoku. Results of anisotropic tomography show that the Pacific and PHS slabs exhibit mainly trench-parallel fast-velocity directions (FVDs), which may reflect lattice-preferred orientation of anisotropic minerals as well as shape-preferred orientation of steep normal faults produced at the outer-rise area near the trench axis. Trench-normal FVDs are generally revealed in the back-arc mantle wedge and subslab asthenosphere, reflecting mantle flows entrained by the plate subductions. Large megathrust earthquakes nucleated in or around patches with high-V, high-Q and low Poisson's ratio along the slab interface, which may represent strongly coupled areas in the megathrust zone, suggesting that structural heterogeneities in the megathrust zone, such as the subducting seafloor topography and compositional variations, control the nucleation of megathrust earthquakes. The PHS slab has subducted aseismically down to ~450\u00a0km depth. The lithospheric age of the PHS slab ranges from 15 to 43 Myr in western Japan. The Beppu-Shimabara graben was produced by joint effects of northward extension of the opening Okinawa Trough, westward extension of the Median Tectonic Line, and hot and wet upwelling flow in the mantle wedge. The generation of large crustal earthquakes is affected by structural heterogeneities in the crust and upper mantle, in particular, arc magma and fluids.

Nevertheless, direct constraints from microstructural observations on the operation of such weakening mechanisms are still lacking for most rock forming minerals. This includes olivine, a very refractory mineral relevant for seismic activity occurring in peridotite massifs. Here, we report mechanical data and microstructures of olivine aggregates deformed in a rotary shear apparatus at slip rates from 10\u22122\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 to 1\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121. A number of 34 shear deformation experiments were performed under axial stresses of 20\u00a0MPa and at room temperature. Samples are composed of either synthetic iron-free nanocrystalline forsterite powder (initial grain size\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u00a0\u03bcm) or natural iron-bearing olivine powder from San Carlos or San Bernardino (Fo91, Arizona, USA; initial grain size\u00a0=\u00a070\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u03bcm). Shear deformation lasts from a few seconds up to 5\u00a0min and ends after 0.03 to 3\u00a0m of slip. Independently of the initial grain size or composition, friction coefficients decrease from peak values of 0.8 to values below 0.4, after only 0.1\u00a0m of slip. The recovered samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. For all samples, before the onset of dynamic weakening, the deformation localizes in a principal shear zone, well-marked in the natural olivine aggregates by a rapid decrease of grain size down to <1.7\u00a0\u03bcm. Variations in texture, fractured grains and the formation of a fine-grained matrix support cataclastic flow at an early stage of deformation, responsible for the foremost grain size reduction. The samples display well-defined zones with partially sintered microstructure, and shape preferred orientation. The initial texture of the cold-pressed starting material is rapidly reduced to a near random distribution after only 0.03\u00a0m of slip. All crystal preferred orientations (CPO) remain weak, with a J-index \u22722. Based on the microstructures, the dominant deformation mechanism may be enhanced effective diffusion (by surface and grain boundary diffusion) causing mechanical weakening and a viscous behavior, which is then temperature-dependent under sub-solidus conditions. We find no microstructural evidence for frictional melting, flash heating or thermal decomposition. Our results advocate that dynamic weakening of faults is independent of initial grain size, and can be achieved after displacements as low as 0.1\u00a0m without production of frictionally induced-melt.\n               ","271":"\n                  Landward increase of surface velocity has been found for segments adjacent along-strike to megathrust faults after the 2003 Tokachi-oki and the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquakes, NE Japan. A similar increase of landward velocities was reported for the segments to the north of the rupture of the 2010 Maule earthquake, Chile. We utilize available GNSS data to find such changes for six megathrust earthquakes in four subduction zones, including NE Japan, central and northern Chile, Sumatra, and Mexico to investigate their common features. Our study showed that such increase, ranging from a few mm\/yr to ~1\u00a0cm\/yr, appeared in adjacent segments following the 2014 Iquique (Chile), the 2007 Bengkulu (Sumatra), and the 2012 Oaxaca (Mexico) earthquakes in addition to the three cases. The region of the increased landward movements extends with spatial decay and reach the distance comparable to the along-strike fault length. On the other hand, the temporal decay of the increased velocity is not clear at present. The degree of increase seems to depend on the earthquake magnitude, and possibly scales with the average fault slip in the earthquake. This is consistent with the simple two-dimensional model proposed earlier to attribute the phenomenon to the enhanced coupling caused by accelerated subduction.

The earthquake is located within the Changning anticline, and it raises great concerns on why and how the event occurred in a relatively quiescent area in terms of tectonic activity. Moreover, it has been debated whether this earthquake ruptured solely on the fold-accommodation faults or also involved a deep-rooted fault under the anticline. By using InSAR data from two satellites, we investigate the detailed rupture and slip pattern of this earthquake. We propose a cascade rupture mode of the fold-accommodation faults, through poroelastic modeling of excess pore pressure by fluid injection and pumping operations and static Coulomb stress calculation on the pre-stressed faults. We argue that water injections may have triggered this event.

The Mw 7.1 earthquake is the largest earthquake ever to have been recorded in the region. Its thrust focal mechanism is also unusual for the region, although the northern part of the microplate is expected to undergo compression. The region is remote and seismological data is limited to a seismic station at ~600\u00a0km distance on Easter Island and teleseismic observations for the largest events. We use a combination of advanced seismological techniques to overcome the lack of local data and resolve earthquake source parameters for the doublet and its aftershock sequence, being able to reconstruct the chronology of the sequence and the geometry of affected fault segments. Our results depict a complex seismic sequence characterized by the interplay of thrust and strike-slip earthquakes along different structures, including a second, reversed strike slip-thrust seismic doublet in November 2014. Seismicity occurred within the microplate and only in the late part of the sequence migrated northward, towards the microplate boundary. The first largest doublet, whose rupture kinematic is well explained by stress changes imparted by the first subevent on the second one, may have activated unmapped E-W and NE-SW faults or an internal curved pseudofault, attributed to the long-term rotation of the microplate. Few large, thrust earthquakes are observed within the sequence, taking place in the vicinity of mapped compressional ridges. We suggest that compressional stresses in the northern part of the microplate and at its boundary are partially accommodated aseismically.

Here, specimens from a prograde sediment sequence of the exhumed fossil European Alpine accretionary wedge were used to investigate resetting processes of white mica by the type and intensity of deformation as well as peak metamorphic conditions. We combine the K-Ar system with mass and mineral quantities from grain size fractions to calculate the amount of recrystallized white mica in each grain size fraction along the metamorphic gradient. Increasing recrystallization with increasing metamorphic grade is related to thermally activated pressure solution and dissolution-precipitation creep, as seen by the formation of a spaced cleavage of recrystallized phyllosilicates documented through Synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscope imaging techniques. Increasing recrystallization by dissolution-precipitation processes induces chemical resetting of the isotopic system, resulting in a prograde decrease of apparent K-Ar ages. We demonstrate that Ar volume diffusion does not play a significant role for the low-temperature samples, promoting recrystallization as the important physico-chemical process for age resetting. However, white mica chemistry reveals that no simple relation between isotopic resetting and grain size exists along the prograde path. Reliable age information can therefore only be obtained in the case of (nearly) complete resetting, which accounts only for the smallest grain size fraction at the highest metamorphic temperature. These findings could shed new light on accurate dating of mica-rich fault rocks, where the time constraints depend not only on the temperature, but also on the amount and type of deformation.\n               ","275":"\n                  The region around the Mejillones Peninsula is characterized by major onshore and offshore fault systems.

The results show that these four earthquakes were all dominated by left- and right-lateral strike-slip motion. The two conjugate faults clearly had significant differences in terms of slip behaviour and fault kinematics. The static Coulomb stress change indicates that earlier earthquakes had a significant triggering effect on subsequent earthquakes. The static Coulomb stress change induced by the four earthquakes suggests a significant stress loading effect on NW-trending faults.

Inside the seismogenic body vertical tension and an overall compressive regime dominates, implying that vertical elongation may be the driving mechanism for brittle failure and that stress is transmitted along the sinking slab to the surface. However, the retrieved stress ratios are low: ~0.2 for mantle earthquakes Mw>4 and ~0.4 for Mw<4, challenging the brittle failure assumption. Increased pore fluid pressure has been shown to lower stress ratios, implying that dehydration embrittlement may contribute to generating intermediate-depth seismicity in the Vrancea slab. Comparisons with seismic tomography and anisotropy studies show excellent correlations between maximum horizontal stress directions, possible slab strike orientation, and seismic anisotropy, especially below ~130km depth, suggesting ambient mantle flow may also promote in-slab stress build-up and seismic potential.\n               ","280":"\n                  A historical earthquake-related co-seismic deformation observed on beachrock beds along the southern shoreline of Lake Iznik is discussed as a new paleoseismic record for an 8th century AD earthquake in the Middle Strand of the North Anatolian Fault, NW Turkey. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) images beneath the beachrock surface allowed monitoring of the subsurface trace of a normal fault dipping north along a 100\u00a0m surface rupture. No strike-slip deformation exists along the rupture, suggesting that the deformation in the beachrock is connected with a secondary structure, and that the main surface rupture was under the lake waters. The deformed beds of the beachrock, dated using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to 1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0ka, are overlain by an undeformed secondary deposition of beds dated to 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0ka.

During the inversion, the structural depression controlled previously by extensional faults was subjected to compression and erosion. Structural interpretation on 2D marine seismic data suggests that the structural styles associated with inversion are predominantly reactivated NNW-trending faults, fault-related folds, newly-formed reverse faults and unconformities. Here we used structural restoration technique to illustrate the sequential development of these inversion structures and to estimate the amount of deformation. To explore the mechanism of the basin inversion, the finite element modeling was employed to reproduce the inversion deformation in the Northern Depression. The deformation features predicted by modeling are well consistent with our structural observations. Based on a combination of these results and regional tectonic history, we propose that the inversion deformation in the South Yellow Sea Basin was predominantly driven by the enhanced dextral strike-slip motion along the Tan-Lu Fault. The interactions between the Eurasian plate and the Pacific realm resulted in the varying dextral movement along the Tan-Lu Fault, and the Cenozoic tectonic inversion in the South Yellow Sea Basin was a tectonic response to these processes.\n               ","283":"\n                  A seismic array comprising 80 broadband stations with ~10\u201320\u00a0km inter-station distances was deployed along the Longmen Shan fault belt (LMSF), the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau. The recorded ambient noise data provided densely distributed inter-station cross-correlated surface waves. A new 3-D crustal S-wave velocity model for the LMSF was constructed by carrying out ambient noise tomography. The inverted model strongly improved data fitting and decreased data misfit compared to the reference (initial) model. The model highlights several crustal structure features. The Baoxing and Pengguan Massifs on the mountain side of the southern-to-middle LMSF exhibit relatively high crustal velocities, probably indicating strong crust. Low crustal velocities that may reflect weak, deformable brittle crust, exist mainly beneath the middle-to-northern segment of the LMSF and partly around the periphery of the Baoxing and Pengguan Massifs in its southern-to-middle segment. Two SW dipping low-velocity (weak) belts approximately perpendicular to the LMSF are imaged respectively around the Wenchuan-earthquake hypocenter in the south and Beichuan in the north. The low velocities in the two belts may focus movement of the eastern Tibetan Plateau relative to the Sichuan Basin (Yangtze Craton), and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau over long time periods. Based on the velocity and tectonic structures, the young, high topography and thickened crust but low GPS shortening rates around the southern-to-middle LMSF may be due to the dominant effect of vertical crustal deformation caused by the existence of the strong Baoxing and Pengguan Massifs. This would then be in contrast to the characteristic lateral movements due to ductile crustal flow or weak, deformable brittle crust typical of the middle-to-northern LMSF.\n               ","284":"\n                  Although several observations have been reported in the literature before a strong earthquake, their relation with the forthcoming event is often controversial. Since many physical processes and parameters govern the dynamics of preparation, initiation, and occurrence of earthquakes, their understanding is essential for explaining anomalous seismological, geophysical, hydrological and geodetic signals before a strong earthquake that may be considered for seismic monitoring and hazard assessment.\n                  In this work, the interseismic and coseismic stress and strain fields associated with the 6 April 2009, Mw 6.3\u00a0L'Aquila earthquake are calculated via a 3D numerical model designed to simulate the crustal interseismic loading and the coseismic brittle episodic dislocation along the fault. The model adopts a framework of gravitational and tectonic forces that are compatible with the geodynamics of the Central Apennines region of the Italian territory. The model assumes a brittle upper crust, where the fault has stick-slip behaviour, and a plastic deeper crust, where the fault is in stationary creep.\n                  The results indicate that the concurrent action of gravitational and tectonic forces determines steep interseismic stress gradients at the transition between the creeping and locked fault planes that promote the coseismic subsidence of the hanging wall. The interseismic strain above the transition between that locked upper fault and its unlocked lower shear zone develops a dilated volume in the hanging wall and a contracted volume in the footwall. These stress and strain variations are compatible with seismological, geophysical and geodetic anomalies observed before the earthquake, i.e., Vp\/Vs anomalies and location of foreshocks. Interseismic stress and strain patterns invert during the coseismic stage. The dilated volume, formed during the interseismic phase, will be contracted at the coseismic stage and, conversely, the footwall volume previously contracted will be expanded.\n               ","285":"","286":"","287":"","288":"","289":"","290":"","291":"","292":"","293":"","294":"","295":"","296":"","297":"\n                  We investigated temporal variations of the bulk strain rate across the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen, which impact the magnitudes, rates, and distribution of deformation across the orogen. The present-day strain rate estimated from geodesy is ~5-6\u00d710-16 s-1 and estimation of past rates depends on the orogenic shortening rate and effective orogen width. Plate-circuit reconstructions provide constraints on time-varying India-Asia convergence rates, showing a marked deceleration since initial collision at ca. 58 Ma. Geologic evidence suggests that most of the Tibetan crust started deforming shortly after initial collision, which simplifies estimation of the initial orogen width. We examined several kinematic models: (1) Greater Indian and Tibetan crust started deforming immediately after collision, (2) only Tibetan crust deformed initially, (3) plate convergence was decoupled from crustal shortening, with Tibetan crust deforming slower than plate rates, or (4) a hard India-Asia collision at ca. 45 Ma following closure of the Xigaze backarc. Models 1, 3, and 4 yield early Cenozoic bulk strain rates that match present-day rates (5-6\u00d710-16 s-1), whereas Model 2 yields faster rates (1.2\u00d710-15 s-1) that must have decreased through time to avoid shortening exceeding total plate convergence. Using these bounds, we constrain crustal shortening across the entire orogen and along its southern and northern margins, defined by the Himalaya and Qilian Shan, respectively. Application of these models to Tibetan crustal thickening suggests that the plateau reached its present-day value (~70 km) by ca. 15 Ma, which corresponds to the onset of lateral deformation (e.g., strike-slip and normal faulting). Lateral deformation in the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen may have resulted from progressive crustal thickening and reorientation of the intermediate principal stress axis. At the thrust-belt scale, our modeling yields shortening rates and magnitudes that match geologic observations. This approach provides testable external kinematic constraints to guide future geological and geophysical investigations.\n               ","298":"\n                  Determining overprinting relationships in the geological record has underpinned our understanding of the evolution of the Earth and has provided the context in which to interpret geoscientific datasets. Geological overprinting relationships are generally determined from outcrop relationships. When outcrop is absent or limited, overprinting relationships using geological observations is often ineffective or ambiguous. We show how aeromagnetic data can be used to inform superposition of geological structures using a combination of folded stratigraphy, faults (both high angle and low angle), and plutons from the well-exposed Hill End Trough, in the Phanerozoic eastern Lachlan Orogen. Overprinting relationships reveal episodic inversion of the Late Silurian to Early Devonian back arc basin succession, preserved within the Hill End Trough, occurred during superimposed shortening events. The first event resulted in the development of regional folds associated with the Tabberabberan Orogeny and the second event resulted in the development of overprinting north-south and north-northwest trending faults during the Early Carboniferous Kanimblan Orogeny. Inversion structures are overprinted by a Carboniferous granite, which is overprinted by previously unrecognised northeast- and northwest conjugate faults, which we interpret to be related to the Permo-Triassic Hunter Bowen Orogeny.\n               ","299":"\n                  The association of mafic extrusive rocks and serpentinized mantle rocks is a common feature encountered in numerous ultra-distal magma-poor rifted margins as well as in (ultra)slow-spreading oceanic settings where detachment faulting and mantle exhumation occur. Although seismic imaging and high-resolution TOBI radar allow imaging this association, the nature of this interface is poorly understood (e.g. nonconformity vs. tectonic channelized vs. diffuse fluid flow along the interface). The timing between magmatism and active detachment faulting is often poorly constrained and it remains difficult to decipher if mafic extrusives are pre-, syn- or post-exhumation of mantle rocks at the seafloor. In this study, we characterize the nature of this interface from a section of a Jurassic ultra-distal margin preserved in the Platta nappe, SE Swiss Alps. We show that the basalt-serpentinized mantle contact does neither correspond to an Alpine thrust system, nor to a nonconformity or a detachment plane exhuming mantle rocks from underneath already emplaced basalts. Rather, the basalt-serpentinite interface corresponds to a weak decoupling level formed by conjugate low-angle normal faults onto which conjugate high-angle normal faults branch. These structures are diagnostic of co-axial extensional tectonics occurring during and after emplacement of basalts over a formerly exhumed serpentinized mantle. Carbonate extensional and shear veins and foliated ophicalcites formed during this Jurassic extensional event. Their distribution across and along the basalt-serpentinite interface demonstrates that this decoupling interface was a high-permeability layer that channelized high fluid flow responsible for the widespread hydrothermal alteration.

This issue has become a societal concern due to the increasing interest in geothermal energy (e.g., Grigoli et al., 2017; Terakawa et al., 2012), CO2 storage (Zoback and Gorelick, 2012), or injection of waste waters associated with hydraulic fracking (Ellsworth, 2013). Natural and artificial sources of fluid can elevate pore-fluid, which can destabilize active faults through either slow-slip or fast, seismic-wave-producing rupture events perceived as earthquakes. Examples of fluid-driven seismic and aseismic slip on natural faults are related to seismic swarms (e.g., Roland and McGuire, 2009; Chen et al., 2012; Hainzl, 2004; Hatch et al., 2020; Ross et al., 2020), aftershock sequences (e.g., Nur and Booker, 1972; Ross et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2004; Miller, 2020), and other natural phenomena such as slow-slip events and tectonic tremors (e.g., B\u00fcrgmann, 2018; Jolivet and Frank, 2020; Behr and B\u00fcrgmann, 2021). On the other hand, fluid injections associated with human activities are well known to lead to the reactivation of faults, slow-slip transients, and earthquakes, which occasionally are large enough to cause damage (e.g., Guglielmi et al., 2015; Deichmann and Giardini, 2009; Ellsworth et al., 2019; Keranen et al., 2013, 2014; Raleigh et al., 1976; Bao and Eaton, 2016). Taken together, this body of work suggest that fluid-driven seismic and aseismic fault slip in nature and anthropogenic fluid injections are closely linked.\nThe propagation of fluid-driven shear cracks, the evolution of pore pressure, and the poroelastic response of faults, have been subjects of interest for decades in the earthquake modeling community (e.g., Rice and Cleary, 1976; Rice, 1992; Dunham and Rice, 2008; Rudnicki and Rice, 2006; Cruz-Atienza et al., 2018; Heimisson et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020; Petrini et al., 2020). Recent modeling efforts have mostly focused on the stability of frictional slip when a fluid is locally injected and diffuses within a fault (Bhattacharya and Viesca, 2019; Cappa et al., 2018; Garagash and Germanovich, 2012; Larochelle et al., 2021; Yang and Dunham, 2021), or when fluid injection initiates shear cracks on a strengthening rate-and-state frictional fault (Dublanchet, 2019). Despite the apparent relevance of fluid-driven slow and fast slip transients in a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic environments, the spatio-temporal evolution of sequences of seismic and aseismic slip in response to pore-fluid evolution remains poorly constrained. This is, in part, due to the challenge of solving a fully coupled solid-fluid system in which the dynamic evolution of fault slip, stress, pore-fluid pressure, and shear strength are unknown.\nIn this study, we present H-MEC (Hydro-Mechanical Earthquake Cycles), a continuum-based modeling approach to solve fully dynamic sequences of seismic and aseismic slip (SEAS) in a poro-visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium with rate-dependent strength, which considerably extends our previous numerical model developed for incompressible media with rate-independent strength (Petrini et al., 2020). The computational framework is developed for the two-dimensional plane strain problem on a simplified strike-slip fault. Our coupled system utilizes Global Picard-iterations with a fully implicit adaptive time to efficiently solve all stages of the earthquake cycle. We apply a staggered finite difference\u2013marker-in-cell (SFD-MIC) method, as it is easy to implement, flexible, and the marker-in-cell technique is often used to resolve highly deforming materials, such as faults and geologic structures (Gerya and Yuen, 2007; Petrini et al., 2020).\nThe goal of this study is to provide a quantitative set of numerical experiments in which we test analytical benchmarks and illustrative examples of sequences of seismic and aseismic slip along with results from the solid-fluid coupling, fluid transport on- and off-fault, pore pressure evolution, and fault slip. Our focus is to demonstrate the validity of our methodology and highlight the mechanical response of a fault zone from the solid-fluid coupling. We apply this methodology in the context of a simple, 2-D plane strain model of a strike-slip fault in a homogeneous bulk domain, which is an idealization of a natural strike-slip fault. In Section 2, we present the conceptual and mathematical model and state the continuum problem solved in this work. In Section 3, we present results of two analytical benchmarks and a set of simulations of earthquake sequences. In Section 4 we analyze and interpret the results and compare solutions for different confining pressure, solid and fluid compressibility, porosity, and fracture energy. Lastly, we discuss possible applications of this methodology for future research.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\n\n2.1\nGoverning equations\nThe physical description of a deforming continuum in a static gravity field is given by the following set of conservation equations for total momentum (solid matrix and fluid; Eq.

(3)) and fluid (Eq. (4)) contain poroelasticity terms consistent with Biot's theory (Biot, 1941; Gassmann, 1951; Yarushina and Podladchikov, 2015), which allow for compressibility of the solid matrix and fluid as well as viscous and elastic (de)compaction of the porous space. Being Eqs. (3) and (4) fully coupled, convergence and divergence of the vector flow occur as a result of compaction\/decompaction processes, which results in a fully coupled hydro-mechanical system.\n\n\n2.2\nVisco-elasto-plastic rheology\nComponents of the deviatoric deformation (strain rate) tensor are defined upon the assumption of infinitesimal strain as follows:\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n\n\nij\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\ni\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\nj\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\nj\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n3\n\nTr\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n\n\nij\n\n,\n\n\nwhere i and j are arbitrary indexes and x\n\ni\n and x\n\nj\n are the 2-D spatial coordinates defining the tensor components.

As a result, plastic yielding can spontaneously localize anywhere (Dal Zilio et al., 2022). Furthermore, the rate-dependent strength (Eq. (16)) relies on the presence of \u03b3, which mimic the positive direct effect in the rate- and state-dependent friction formulation (e.g., Scholz, 1998), a feature that has ample laboratory confirmation (Dieterich, 1979, 1981; Ruina, 1983; Marone, 1998). On the other hand, our rate-dependent strength formulation does not require the presence of an evolutionary effect involving a decrease in friction. This is because the weakening mechanism in our fully coupled system is controlled by the evolution of pore-fluid pressure (p\n[f]), which is encapsulated in \u03c4\n0 (Eq. (18)).\nThe non-associated plastic flow law is defined through the plastic flow potential (Q), which reflects the amount of mechanical energy per unit volume that supports plastic deformation (Vermeer, 1998)\n\n(20)\n\nQ\n=\n\n\u03c4\nII\n\n\u2212\nsin\n(\n\u03c8\n)\n\n(\n\np\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n\u2212\n\np\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\ncos\n(\n\u03c8\n)\nc\n.\n\n\n\n\nHere we assume that the dilation angle \u03c8 is zero.

Importantly, we do not apply any minimum time step cutoff. This is in contrast to previous studies (e.g., Lapusta and Liu, 2009), in which the time step is only adapted until it reaches \u0394t\nmin\n=(1\/3)\u0394\nx\n\/c\n\ns\n, where c\n\ns\n is the shear wave speed (see Table 1). We do not adopt a minimum time step cutoff because during the propagation of fully dynamic ruptures the actual time step can decreases below the \u0394t\nmin threshold. As a result, applying a cutoff would reduces the convergence rate during Picard iterations (Section 2.3).\n\n\n2.5\nModel setup and boundary conditions\nThe 2-D model setup consists of a strike-slip fault (Fig. 1\n). We consider a mode-II plane strain shear motion along a planar interface embedded in a poro-visco-elasto-plastic medium (Fig. 1). We utilize a x\n\u2212\ny Cartesian coordinate system with y\n=0 being the sliding interface. This simple setup is designed to enable comparison to both analytical benchmarks for numerical solution and classical earthquake cycle simulations and theoretical estimates of the critical length scales during nucleation and propagation of dynamic ruptures (e.g., Lapusta et al., 2000). Parameters and physical constants are given in Table 1.\nThe system of equations over the domain \u03a9=[0, L\n\nx\n]\u00d7[0, L\n\ny\n] is solved by using specific boundary conditions for pressure and velocity (Fig. 1). For the model setup of this study, the conditions on the left (x\n=0) and right (x\n=\nL\n\nx\n) boundaries are open and allow for horizontal shear:\n\n\n\n\n(40a)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\nx\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nx\n=\n0\n\n\n,\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\ny\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nx\n=\n0\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n(40b)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\nx\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nx\n=\n\nL\nx\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\ny\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nx\n=\n\nL\nx\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis condition implies that the velocity component parallel to the boundary is constant (zero shear stress), whereas the velocity component normal to the boundary does not change across the boundary. The fault is loaded from the upper (y\n=0) and lower boundaries (y\n=\nL\n\ny\n) by applying a constant loading rate in the form of Dirichlet boundary conditions and assuming zero velocity on the vertical component \n\nv\ny\n\n (Fig. 1):\n\n\n\n\n(41a)\n\n\nv\nx\n\n=\n+\n\n1\n2\n\n\nV\npl\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n0\n\n\n,\n\nv\ny\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n0\n\n\n;\n\n\n\n(41b)\n\n\nv\nx\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n;\n\nV\npl\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n\nL\ny\n\n\n\n\n,\ny\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n\nL\ny\n\n\n\n;\n\n\n\nwhere V\npl\n=6.3 cm yr\u22121 is the constant loading rate.\nPressure boundary conditions have to be defined for both total (p\n[t]) and fluid (p\n[f]) pressure. Since the solid mass (Eq. (3)) and fluid mass (Eq.

In particular, we consider two benchmark exercises (BP1 and BP2) from a set of quasi-static problems in a 2-D domain with a 1-D fault subjected to perturbations of fluid injection and along-fault pore-fluid diffusion. In order to verify these two benchmarks, we modify the model setup given in Section 2.5 by including an injection point on the left boundary (Fig. 2\na).\nFor the first benchmark problem (BP1), injection is modeled as a source of constant fluid pressure (\u0394p\n[f]) at x\n\ninj\n\n=\nx\n(0). The resulting pore-fluid pressure diffusion along the interface can be solved analytically as (e.g., Viesca, 2021)\n\n(45)\n\n\np\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\n=\n\np\n0\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n+\n\u0394\n\np\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n\u00b7\nerfc\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n|\nx\n|\n\n\n\nl\nd\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere erfc is the complementary error function, \n\nl\nd\n\n(\nt\n)\n=\n\n\n4\n\n\u03b1\n\nt\n\n\n is the diffusion lengthscale, and \u03b1 is the constant hydraulic diffusivity\n\n(46)\n\n\u03b1\n=\n\n\n\nk\n\n[\n\u03d5\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n*\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03b7\n[f] is the viscosity of the permeating fluid and \u03b2* is a storage coefficient reflecting the compressibility of the fluid and porous matrix. On the other hand, the second benchmark problem (BP2) assumes a constant volume rate injection from a point source (x\n\ninj\n\n=\nx\n(0)), and the flow solution is given by Carslaw and Jaeger (1959):\n\n(47)\n\np\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\np\n0\n\n=\n\n\n\nQ\nw\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\nk\n\n[\n\u03d5\n]\n\n\nh\n\n\n\nE\n1\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nx\n\u2212\n\nx\ninj\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\u03b1\nt\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \n\nQ\nw\n\n is the constant injection volume rate, h is the fault thickness, and E1 is the exponential integral function. Note that the fault hydraulic transmissivity represents the product k\n[\u03d5]\n\nh.\nFor both benchmarks BP1 and BP2, fluid is injected into the fault and it is constrained to flow only within its hydraulic aperture, a scenario that would occur when the permeability of the host rock is negligible relative to the fault itself (i.e. no fluid leak-off). Also, the fault is assumed marginally pressurized \u2014 that is, \u0394p\n[f] is always below the total pressure (in order to avoid hydraulic fracturing). Fig. 2 shows the results from the BP1 (Fig. 2b) and BP2 (Fig. 2c) and demonstrates the high accuracy of the numerical solution, which overlaps with the analytical solutions at different time stages. It is worth noting that the exponential integral function in Eq. (47) is singular at the injection point x\n=\nx\n\ninj\n (Fig. 2c). This means that, for the case of injection experiments at constant volume rate, the fluid pressure at the origin is unbounded.\n\n\n3.2\nEarthquake cycles\nThe long-term response of the fault to slow loading rate is characterized by periods of quasi-static deformation followed by slip events, either slow or fast (Fig. 3\na\u2013c), in which the slip rate on the fault accelerates from \u223ccm yr\u22121 to \u223cm s\u22121 (Fig. 3d). As a result, the adaptive time step is large (fraction of a year) during the inter-seismic periods, and small (milliseconds) during the occurrence of dynamic rupture (Fig. 3e). Similarly, the effective pressure (p\n[t]\n\u2212\np\n[f]) drops by \u223c20 MPa as a result of the poroelastic response of the fault zone during fast shearing (Fig. 3f).\nSlip history on the fault indicate that, when assuming homogeneous properties, regular cycles of complete ruptures arises from the numerical experiments (Fig. 4\n). While the imposed loading rate increases stress linearly with time, slip rate increases exponentially on both the left and right side of the fault, i.e., where \u03b3 is high (Fig. 1b). Consequently, the two lateral segments of the fault steadily creep at rates comparable to the imposed loading rate (Fig. 4a), the seismogenic zone remains locked during inter-seismic periods and stress concentrates at the transition between high and low \u03b3. In the later stages of the inter-seismic periods, the rate-strengthening behavior allows creep to penetrate from both the left and the right segments towards the center of the fault, thus leading to a mechanical erosion of the locked patch. Due to a relatively large critical nucleation size (L\n\nc\n, Eq. (51)), seismic events nucleate at the center of the seismogenic zone and the resulting dynamic ruptures typically propagate in a bilateral and symmetric fashion (Fig. 4a). For the reference model, the average slip rate is 0.82 m s\u22121, whereas the average rupture speed is \u223c2.35 km s\u22121.\nEvolution of the cumulative slip over multiple earthquake cycles is displayed in Fig. 4b. In particular, the accumulation of slip during the inter-seismic periods is represented by gray lines, which are plotted every 4 years, whereas the co-seismic slip is displayed every 0.4 s when the fault slip exceeds the following threshold (V\n\nth\n)\n\n(48)\n\n\nV\nth\n\n=\n\n\n2\n\u03b3\n\np\neff\n\n\nc\ns\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n,\n\n\nwhich, according to our parameters, yields to a threshold of 8.1 cm s\u22121. When the fault is experiencing a seismic event, the cumulative slip on the fault indicates that a complete fault rupture produces \u223c5 m of slip, which is followed by a transient post-seismic deformation of \u223c0.8\u20131 m (blue lines; Fig. 4b). Our models show that dynamic ruptures occur due to an abrupt increase of pore-fluid pressure within the fault zone (Fig. 5\na). The increase in pore-fluid pressure is simultaneously coupled to a rapid decrease in shear strength (Fig. 5b) and both shear and compaction viscosity (Fig. 5c), which are self-sustained by a localized strain rate. When an event begins to propagate dynamically, it produces a shear stress breakdown from its maximum static value to a low, dynamic value (Fig. 5b). Notably, at co-seismic slip rates, the effective shear viscosity drops by roughly 10 orders of magnitude (Fig. 5c), whereas static stress change immediately after the event results in a stress concentration at the transition between the lateral creeping segments and the seismogenic zone.\nTo investigate the influence that pore-fluid pressure level has on the spontaneous activation of seismic and aseismic slip on the fault, we perform further numerical experiments in which we increase (model M2) and decrease the effective pressure (p\neff) (model M3) compared to the value used for the reference model (Fig. 6\n). The two models illuminate the effect of pore-fluid pressure throughout the earthquake cycle, from the recurrence period to the nucleation phase of seismic events, as well as the relation between seismic and aseismic slip. In model M2 (Fig. 6b), due to a lower pore-fluid pressure, the effective pressure on the fault is higher (p\neff\n= 60 MPa), and consequently the critical nucleation size decreases. As a result, seismic events nucleate earlier than in the reference model (Fig. 3d). The smaller nucleation size combined with a slightly asymmetric fault structure (Fig. 1b) allow seismic ruptures to nucleate on one side of the seismogenic fault and propagate unilaterally on the other side of the fault segment in an asymmetric fashion. On the other hand, model M3 (Fig. 6c) assumes a higher pore-fluid pressure, which results in a lower effective pressure (p\neff\n= 20 MPa). In this case, the average shear strength is significantly lower than in model M2 and plastic yielding occurs more easily. Consequently, the seismogenic zone promotes unstable slip, either as seismic partial ruptures or as slow-slip transients. The long-term slip history indicates a mixture of fast and slow events, with a recurrence interval that vary over time. These results are important, as they suggest that pore-fluid pressure evolution in the same fault segment can release tectonic stress through both slow and fast ruptures, without incorporating any rate- and state-dependent friction.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nPoro-visco-elasto-plastic (de)compaction and propagation of solitary pressure waves\nA large body of theoretical work has explored the physics of solid-fluid interaction in active faults and earthquake source processes (e.g., and references therein Rice and Simons, 1976; Rice, 1992; Segall and Rice, 1995; Garagash and Rudnicki, 2003; Dunham and Rice, 2008; Liu and Rubin, 2010; Miller, 2013). In particular, a number of studies have focused on the relationship between porosity evolution, (de)compaction of reologically complex visco-(elasto)-plastic porous media, and fluid transport through the propagation of porosity waves (e.g., Connolly and Podladchikov, 2000, 2007; Cruz-Atienza et al., 2018, 2018; Yarushina and Podladchikov, 2015; Skarbek and Rempel, 2016; Petrini et al., 2020; Dal Zilio and Gerya, 2022).\nAccording to our results, it appears clear that visco-plastic compaction of fluid-filled porous media can lead to an abrupt self-pressurization of the fault zone, particularly under undrained conditions or when the permeability on the fault is sufficiently low to prevent fluid flux on the boundaries of the fault zone on the timescale of seismic ruptures. As a result, the self-pressurization of the fault zone can trigger the propagation of solitary pressure waves, which can travel at co-seismic speed. To analyze the effect of solid-fluid (de)compaction, we quantify the separate contributions of visco-plastic compaction of the solid skeleton (\u03b6\n[vp]) and the decompaction of the fluid phase (\u03b6\n[e]) as follow:\n\n(49)\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n[\nvp\n]\n\n\n=\n\n\n\np\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n\u2212\n\np\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n[\n\u03d5\n]\n\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03d5\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(50)\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n[\ne\n]\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n[\nd\n]\n\n\n\n(\n(\n\np\n\n|\nt\n\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n\u2212\n\np\n\n|\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n)\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n(\n\np\n\n|\nt\n\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n+\n\np\n\n|\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n(De)compaction along the fault during a representative major event is shown in Fig. 7\n. Temporal evolution of the slip velocity displays a large event propagating unilaterally from the left to the right side of the seismogenic zone (Fig. 7a). An accurate quantification of visco-plastic compaction from Eq. (49) and elastic decompaction from Eq. (50) indicates that plastic yielding during the gradual nucleation phase is associated with a rapid increase in solid compaction (Fig. 7b), which is followed by a negative increase of fluid decompaction (Fig. 7c). As a result, pore-fluid pressure on the fault increases while shear strength decreases, thus causing a shear instability. Such shear instability grows on a relatively short time scale, causing the propagation of a dynamic rupture in the form of a pulse-like pressure wave (Fig. 7d). Notably, the strain difference between the elastic decompaction and the visco-plastic compaction represents the finite pore volume change. The combination of these two interconnected processes results in a small change in porosity and, in turn, permeability (Eq. (5)). Furthermore, a dynamic rupture causes an increased in pore-fluid pressure due to elastically stressed pores, which is better resolved by our fully compressible model with rate dependent strength compared to the previous simplified incompressible formulation (Petrini et al., 2020). Such increases in pore-fluid pressure are released over a relatively long diffusion period, which essentially depends on the permeability of both the host rock and the fault zone.\nIt is important to note that the magnitude of visco-plastic and elastic (de)compaction depend on the compressibility of both the solid skeleton (\u03b2\n[s]) and the fluid phase (\u03b2\n[f]), as they have a direct impact on the Biot-Willis coefficient (\u03b1; Eq. (6b)), and the Skempton coefficient (B; Eq. (6c)). To quantify the role of solid and fluid compressibility, we execute two parameter studies of solid-fluid compressibility assuming two end-member porosities (i.e., 1% and 10%; Tewksbury-Christle and Behr, 2021), knowing that in nature the compressibility of porous rocks, and in particular fluids, can vary up to two orders of magnitude (e.g., Zimmerman et al., 1986; Span and Wagner, 1996; Mitchell and Soga, 2005). Our models produce distinctly different slip patterns within the range of solid-fluid compressibility (Fig. 8\n). As illustrated in Fig. 8a, an increase in fluid compressibility leads to a transition from regular seismic events, to slow-slip events and eventually stable creep. In contrast, solid compressibility plays only a subordinate role. Furthermore, when we increase the reference porosity from 1% to 10% (Fig. 8b), the parameter space in which we observe slow-slip events broaden. While high porosity serves as a damping factor to suppress the self-pressurization of pore-fluid and thus the occurrence of fast events, these results indicate that fluid compressibility can significantly affect the slip response of a fault loaded by tectonic stresses. As such, the higher the fluid compressibility, the lower the self-pressurization of the fault zone. Our numerical results can thus reproduce the full spectrum of fault slip behaviors under geophysically relevant conditions of pore-fluid pressure and fault composition, from slow to fast events, as observed for tectonic faults (e.g., B\u00fcrgmann, 2018; Obara and Kato, 2016; Jolivet and Frank, 2020).\n\n\n4.2\nNucleation length, cohesive zone size, and fracture energy\nThe computational framework presented here is capable of resolving long-term deformation histories with continuous aseismic creep in the stable rate-strengthening fault regions throughout the loading period, nucleation of shear instabilities, co-seismic propagation of seismic ruptures, and post-seismic relaxation. As the considered example shown in Fig. 9\n, the algorithm is formulated with a rate-strengthening yield strength (Eq. (16)), in which the rate-strengthening exponent (\u03b3) is decisive for its success to reproduce long-term inter-seismic periods with essentially quasi-static deformation, aseismic slip, and most importantly, gradual nucleation of dynamic ruptures (Fig. 9a) (e.g., Dieterich, 1992; Lapusta et al., 2000). However, compared to the formulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction laws (e.g., Scholz, 1998), the evolutionary effect during the weakening phase is controlled by self-pressurization of pore-fluid pressure.\nOur models indicate that shear cracks would become unstable when they reach the critical nucleation length (L\n\nc\n) proposed by Andrews (1976), in which shear strength linearly decreases from static shear strength (\u03c4\n\ns\n) to a relatively low dynamic shear strength (\u03c4\n\nd\n) over a characteristic slip weakening distance (d\n\nc\n) (Ida, 1972)\n\n(51)\n\n\nL\nc\n\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n(\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nd\n\n)\n\nd\nc\n\n\n\n\u03c0\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n0\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nd\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c4\n0 represents the initial shear stress (Eq. (18)). According to our model (Fig. 9a), Eq (51) predicts a critical nucleation length of \u223c7.3 km. Comparing Fig. 4a and Fig. 6a with Fig. 9a, we notice that slip during and right after the nucleation phase are very similar despite the different critical nucleation length. This means that observing signals from the nucleation of fluid-driven shear cracks do not provide any evidence on the final size of the event. This suggests that the final size of seismic events is determined by the conditions on the fault, rather than by the nucleation process itself.\n\nFig. 9b illustrates the weakening phases that buffer the pore pressure and slip velocity rise, leading to dynamic rupture. During Phase I, upon rapid loading, shear stress rises abruptly with strain as the fault is elastically loaded previous to the onset of slip. Phase II is characterized by a strain-hardening shear strength, which produces an early phase of slip (<1 cm of slip), and corresponds roughly to slip rates of the order of 1\u201310 cm s\u22121. During Phase III, an abrupt weakening is initiated and shear strength drops while slip rate quickly accelerates up to \u223cm\/s. Peak in slip rate is reached when strength drop is completed, which is follow by a quasi steady-state phase where low shear strength is maintained with minor fluctuations.\nDuring the nucleation phase of a seismic event, slip velocity increases rapidly while shear stress drops significantly. Since the rupture speed during this phase is still close to zero, the critical distance along which the shear stress drops represents the quasi static cohesive zone length (\u039b). The cohesive zone size is an important resolution criterion in dynamic rupture because it provides the critical spatial length scale over which the shear stress drops at the propagating rupture front (Palmer and Rice, 1973; Day et al., 2005). Since fluid-driven shear cracks essentially mimic a linear slip-weakening law (Fig. 9c), the cohesive zone sizes at rupture speed c\n=0+ (\u039b0) observed in our simulations correspond quite well to the estimate proposed by Day et al. (2005):\n\n(52)\n\n\n\u039b\n0\n\n=\n\n\n9\n\u03c0\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n*\n\n\nd\nc\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nd\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere 9\u03c0\/32 is a constant if the stress traction distribution within the cohesive zone is linear in space (Palmer and Rice, 1973). This latter study establishes that \u039b0\/\u0394x of 3 to 5 is required to resolve dynamic rupture. The ratio of nucleation zone size and cohesive zone size (\u039b0\/L\n\nc\n) is between 0.3 and 0.5, as reported in previous studies (e.g., Lapusta et al., 2000). Therefore, resolving the cohesive zone is the most important critical length scale. In our simulations, we choose a cell size of \u0394x=100 m, which allows us to resolve the cohesive zone of 2.5 km with at least 25 cells.\nSeismic ruptures are controlled by an energy balance involving elastic work, wave radiation, and dissipation by anelastic processes, including friction and plastic strain. As illustrated in Fig. 9c, the frictional work during the weakening process \u2014 as the product of shear stress and slip \u2014 equates to a simple form of fracture energy (G\u2032), which assumes a linear slip weakening (Palmer and Rice, 1973; Andrews, 1976; Okubo and Dieterich, 1984)\n\n(53)\n\n\nG\n\u2032\n\n(\n\u03b4\n)\n=\n\n\u222b\n0\n\u03b4\n\n[\n\u03c4\n(\n\n\u03b4\n\u2032\n\n)\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n(\n\u03b4\n)\n]\n\nd\n\n\u03b4\n\u2032\n\n\u2248\n\n1\n2\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nd\n\n)\n\nd\nc\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo compare our modeling results with existing measurements of fracture energy from earthquakes globally, we compile fracture energy estimates made previously with events spanning five orders of magnitude in size, from borehole microseismicity to great earthquakes (Abercrombie and Rice, 2005; Rice, 2006; Malagnini et al., 2014; Viesca and Garagash, 2015; Nielsen et al., 2016a; Tinti et al., 2005) (Fig. 10\n). Previous inferences have shown a nonlinear scaling of fracture energy with slip (Abercrombie and Rice, 2005), from G\n\u221d\n\u03b4\n2 for small earthquakes to G\n\u221d\n\u03b4\n2\/3 for large earthquakes (Fig. 10), which has been attributed to thermal pressurization of pore-fluid by the rapid shear heating of fault gouge (Viesca and Garagash, 2015). For the set of parameters considered in this study, our models produce both relatively large stress drop (\u03c4\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n\nd\n) and large characteristic slip weakening distance (d\n\nc\n), which results in high values of fracture energy (Fig. 9c). Remarkably, the range of fracture energy and slip from our dynamic analysis supports the observed G\n\u221d\n\u03b4\n2\/3 scaling of fracture energy for large earthquakes, and suggests that self-pressurization of fluids is a viable mechanism for explaining widespread and prominent process of fault weakening.\nIt is important to note that in our models d\n\nc\n is not a constant, as it is treated as variable and it is dynamically determined during rupture the itself (Fig. 9c). The weakening distance d\n\nc\n has been widely used in fault studies and often imposed as a constant (e.g., Tse and Rice, 1986; Ben-Zion and Rice, 1995; Lapusta et al., 2000; Rubin and Ampuero, 2005; Lapusta and Liu, 2009). However, ample observations suggest that d\n\nc\n should be treated as a variable (Cocco and Bizzarri, 2002; Nielsen et al., 2010), since the effective weakening distance depends on slip history and loading conditions (e.g., Guatteri et al., 2001; Tinti et al., 2004). Furthermore, laboratory measures of d\n\nc\n using rotary friction experiments performed at seismic slip rates (\u223c1 m s\u22121) yield weakening distances of the order of meters (and references therein Nielsen et al., 2016a), substantial friction drops (Di Toro et al., 2011), and fracture energies arguably in the same order as the seismological estimates (Nielsen et al., 2016b).\n\n\n4.3\nFuture avenues for research\nDespite the simple setup, the proposed methodology can be used to investigate a number of different problems related to solid-fluid interactions, e.g., fluid-driven swarms, aftershocks, and foreshock sequences (e.g., Ross et al., 2020; Miller, 2020). Furthemore, the developed methodology presents a promising avenue for investigating slip that occurs in response to fluid injection into a permeable fault governed by either rate-strengthening yield strength or rate-and-state friction (e.g., Yang and Dunham, 2021). It is important to note that inelastic changes of permeability and porosity, which can arise from shear-induced dilatancy (e.g., Segall and Rice, 1995), have been neglected for simplicity. Future research will focus on the dynamic evolution of permeability, including deformation-induced changes in pores connectivity and dilatancy effect in a more complex time-dependent hydro-thermo-mechanical framework. However, our results demonstrate that the (de)compaction of the fault zone and associated fluid pressurization are the dominant mechanism controlling the occurrence of fault failure. Shear-induced dilatancy of fault gouge is a transient phenomenon during the initial stages of fault slip, and its effect is poorly constrained at great depth as it is only investigated experimentally at relatively low-pressure conditions (e.g., Brantut et al., 2018). Furthermore, laboratory measurements of pore-fluid pressure variations during fast slip in fault gouge samples seem to confirm that both mechanical compaction and fluid pressurization can overcome the initial phase of shear-induced dilatancy and thus induce fault failure (Aretusini et al., 2021). Future work will also focus on three-dimensional models (e.g., Jiang et al., 2022) and more realistic scenarios of geologic faults (e.g., Dal Zilio et al., 2018, 2019), which will allow to investigate the full spectrum of slip behavior observed in different tectonic settings (e.g., Jolivet and Frank, 2020; Behr and B\u00fcrgmann, 2021; Dal Zilio et al., 2021).\nWhile space geodesy has revolutionized our understanding of how tectonic faults accommodate earthquakes, slow-slip transients, and stable creep (e.g., B\u00fcrgmann, 2018), their short instrumental record makes it virtually impossible to understand the spatiotemporal interplay between different slip modes. Investigating whether pore-fluid diffusion affects variations in earthquake recurrence intervals, or fault tremor sequences with alternating longer and shorter repeat times (so-called period-doubling events) (Shelly, 2010), is a central question in earthquake physics. Also, systematic investigation of the visco-plastic bulk conditions that control slow-slip events (e.g., Viesca and Dublanchet, 2018; Lambert and Barbot, 2016; Gao and Wang, 2017; Wang and Barbot, 2020; Fagereng, Beall, 2021; Dal Zilio et al., 2022), rather than fault frictional properties (e.g., (Liu and Rice, 2007; Dal Zilio et al., 2020)), is an important frontier in earthquake source modeling. Further implementations can also account for temperature evolution, fault dilation, shear heating, thermal runaway (e.g., Braeck and Podladchikov, 2007), and the evolution of grain size (e.g., Austin and Evans, 2007), which can provide new insights into the onset of highly localized, fine-grained shear processes. Since shear heating can rapidly increase temperature (Viesca and Garagash, 2015), the associated weakening of shear strength may provide the conditions for episodic slow-slip transients, even under rate-strengthening fault behavior.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe have developed a finite difference method to account for fully coupled solid-fluid interaction over many earthquake cycles. The computational framework can model rate-strengthening plasticity in a poro-visco-elasto-plastic rheology. Numerical results are verified through convergence tests and comparisons with analytical benchmarks of pore-fluid pressure diffusion from an injection point along a finite fault width. Future work will include a deeper exploration of parameter space, including the effects of permeability, rate-strengthening, and viscosity, as our set of parameters were chosen primarily for efficiency of computation. For the parameter study in this work, we found that pore-fluid pressure, porosity, and solid-fluid compressibility, influence the occurrence of seismic and aseismic slip.\nWe have investigated spontaneously occurring shear instabilities on a mildly rate-strengthening fault zone with solid-fluid coupling. Remarkably, these instabilities are fundamentally different from standard instabilities with rate-and-state friction in that they are controlled by localized (de)compaction of pores and dynamic self-pressurization of fluids inside the undrained fault zone. Simulations show that these fluid-driven dynamic ruptures are controlled by solitary pulse-like pressure waves propagating at seismic speed. We have proposed a conceptual model for how this type of instability manifest in a 2-D plane strain shear model (mode-II). However, we recognize that in order to make a full comparison to geological settings we need to understand how the reported instabilities manifest in three dimensions. Despite this limitation, our work demonstrates how pore-fluid pressure, poroelastic effects, and inelastic deformation, can destabilize active faults and produce the full spectrum of slip, from fast- to slow-slip, consistent with observations.\nAlthough multiple weakening mechanisms may operate on active faults, our results suggest that self-pressurization of fluid-filled porous rocks may be the dominant contributor to fault fracture energy, particularly for large earthquakes. Understanding how faults lose their shear strength during fluid-induced dynamic rupture is critical, as it may help to constrain the minimum level of shear stress a fault requires to become unstable. In a broader context, this study shows the importance of incorporating the realistic hydro-mechanical structure of faults to investigate sequences of seismic and aseismic slip. In particular, this study indicates that pore-pressure evolution can completely change both the failure process on the interface and the long-term slip history of geologic faults.\n\n\nData availability statement\nData related to this paper are stored in the ETH-Bibliothek and can be downloaded from the following link: http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/20.500.11850\/532225 (doi: http:\/\/10.3929\/ethz-b-000532225)\n\n","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe 2018 MW 7.5 Palu, Indonesia, earthquake produced a devastating tsunami by a strike-slip earthquake (e.g., Muhari et al., 2018). The tsunami has relatively short periods (~100\u00a0s, Carvajal et al., 2019), which inundated only ~400\u00a0m inland, but the tsunami runup reached >10\u00a0m, causing over 1200 fatalities. The short periods of the tsunami can be understood by short-wavelength source(s) within the narrow Palu Bay (up to ~7\u00a0km wide), but the large runup is puzzling because a strike-slip earthquake is expected to produce predominantly horizontal and small vertical motion. Indisputably, this earthquake calls for a better understanding of the physics of tsunamigenesis and more accurate tsunami hazard assessments in strike-slip environments.\nThere is ongoing debate between the earthquake and submarine landslides as to the source(s) of the 2018 Palu tsunami. Eyewitnesses of sizable tsunamis from small-scale landslides near the coast (e.g., Carvajal et al., 2019) and presumption of a strike-slip earthquake incapable of producing large seafloor uplift led to models attributing the tsunami to submarine landslides (e.g., Nakata et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Several studies modeled the tsunami by the earthquake only (e.g., Heidarzadeh et al., 2018; Jamelot et al., 2019; Ulrich et al., 2019). In particular, Ulrich et al. (2019) concluded that ~2\u00a0m coseismic oblique slip on a 65\u00b0-dipping normal fault causing seafloor subsidence beneath Palu Bay is critical for the generation of the devastating tsunami. In contrast, Jamelot et al. (2019) modeled a major restraining bend under Palu Bay using elastic dislocation, which produced broad seafloor uplift well above 1\u00a0m between the fault and east shoreline. However, Nakata et al. (2020) pointed out that the broad subsidence and uplift in these two models are inconsistent with the observation at the tidal station, Pantoloan, where no considerable mean tidal level change due to the earthquake deformation was observed (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2020); the tidal record indicates a more localized source in Palu Bay. Many models attributed the tsunami to both the earthquake and landslides (e.g., Williamson et al., 2020; Sep\u00falveda et al., 2020), with the major role of tsunami generation by submarine landslides in most of these models. Due to the availability of only one tidal record at Pantoloan (with a low sampling rate), though augmented by several sea-surface time histories extracted from recorded videos on social media (Carvajal et al., 2019), and somewhat poor understanding of fault geometry and location and submarine landslide sources (e.g., locations and volumes) there can be tradeoffs and non-uniqueness in these models; the source for the 2018 Palu tsunami is probably far from being well resolved.\nSeveral observations suggest that the 2018 Palu earthquake propagated with a supershear rupture velocity (e.g., Bao et al., 2019; Socquet et al., 2019). Mai (2019) hypothesized a possible connection between the supershear rupture and the devastating tsunami. Elbanna et al. (2021) investigated this hypothesis by numerically modeling a vertical strike-slip earthquake, coupled with the shallow water equation for tsunami in an idealized bay. Although supershear rupture on a planar strike-slip fault does not produce large permanent uplift they emphasized the importance of large seafloor velocity carried by supershear Mach fronts and excitation of tsunami by large horizontal velocity at seafloor slopes, claiming that dynamics of supershear rupture on a planar fault is important and can generate large tsunami (>1\u00a0m) in a narrow and shallow bay. However, the large sea surface height associated with supershear rupture in their model may not be tsunami because high-frequency nature of supershear seafloor motion (horizontal and vertical) can excite strong acoustic waves in real ocean and the large kinetic energy of supershear rupture is carried away by acoustic waves, which is ignored by the shallow water equation. Tsunami, however, is a gravitational wave with much longer period, insensitive to short-period excitations. Coupled models of earthquake and tsunami including ocean acoustic waves clearly showed the separation of these different types of waves and that tsunami is only sensitive to the final static deformation (e.g., Lotto and Dunham, 2015; Lotto et al., 2017, 2018; Saito et al., 2019; Wilson and Ma, 2021; Krenz et al., 2021). Supershear rupture does not produce large tsunami, which will be demonstrated in this work.\n\nGusman et al. (2019) inverted the synthetic aperture radar displacement data and the tidal record at Pantoloan. They inferred that an uplift up to 0.8\u00a0m in the middle of Palu Bay was the major source of the tsunami and hypothesized that the compression at unmapped restraining bends or stepovers beneath Palu Bay may have contributed to the seafloor uplift. This hypothesis is similar to the coseismic pop-up hypothesis for tsunami generation by strike-slip earthquakes proposed by Legg et al. (2003).\nAnother hypothesis for the generation of Palu tsunami comes from Natawidjaja et al. (2020). They mapped a major releasing bend (~3.5\u00a0km wide) under Palu Bay and suggested that fault slip at this bend and several other major offshore faults north of Palu Bay as well as triggered submarine landslides may have generated the devastating tsunami. One inconsistency with this hypothesis is that the releasing bend would produce subsidence instead of uplift. Also, mechanically releasing bends tend to slow down or stop the rupture due to the strengthening effect of pore fluids (e.g., Sibson, 1986; Hirakawa and Ma, 2018). The Palu earthquake indeed stopped shortly after passing a\u00a0~\u00a07\u00a0km wide releasing bend in the south. Moreover, the hypocenter in this model is offshore, which is different from many other models for the Palu earthquake (e.g., Socquet et al., 2019; Bao et al., 2019).\nIt is important to realize that restraining and releasing bends are prevalently coexistent due to local fault strike variations, resulting in rapid variations of local stress field in a region (e.g., Legg et al., 2007). Socquet et al. (2019) resolved local transpression under Palu Bay and north of 0.7\u00b0S in Sulawesi Neck although the Palu region is overall under transtension (e.g., Socquet et al., 2006). For the Palu earthquake rupture to propagate from Sulawesi Neck northeast of the bay to southwest local transpression at fault bends or stepovers beneath the bay can be envisioned in a left-lateral strike-slip environment (e.g., Jamelot et al., 2019; Gusman et al., 2019; Williamson et al., 2020; Sep\u00falveda et al., 2020).\nOther than the 2018 Palu earthquake, the 1994 MW 7.1 Mindoro Island, Philippines, earthquake is another example of a strike-slip earthquake producing a large tsunami (e.g., Imamura et al., 1995). In this work, I do not model a particular event, but present a mechanism for efficient tsunami generation in a strike-slip setting involving restraining bends, in support of the pop-up hypothesis of Legg et al. (2003) and Gusman et al. (2019) mentioned above. This mechanism is generic and aimed for tsunamigenesis by strike-slip earthquakes with fault complexities worldwide, including possibly at Palu Bay.\nNearly all the earthquake models with fault bends for the Palu earthquake (e.g., Jamelot et al., 2019; Sep\u00falveda et al., 2020; Williamson et al., 2020) and other strike-slip earthquakes (e.g., Geist and Zoback, 2002; Borrero et al., 2004) to explain tsunamigenesis used elastic dislocation theory (e.g., Okada, 1985). However, elastic dislocation models do not produce efficient seafloor uplift at fault bends or stepovers. Here I will show that dynamic off-fault failure (inelastic deformation) at restraining bends is an important tsunami source in a strike-slip earthquake, which has been largely unrecognized although coseismic pop-up structures are widely observed (e.g., Hamling et al., 2017). By modeling 3D dynamic rupture on a vertical strike-slip fault with undrained inelastic off-fault response inelastic deformation at restraining bends will be shown below to produce significantly larger and more localized surface uplift than a purely elastic dislocation model, due to frictional sliding with a thrust component on conjugate microfractures produced by dynamic failure. The inelastic zone along with the produced surface uplift result in a positive flower and pop-up structure, which generates localized tsunami efficiently in shallow water, in contrast to the broad uplift in the elastic dislocation model with fault bends (e.g., Jamelot et al., 2019). This mechanism is similar to the one applied in inelastic wedge deformation models for tsunamigenesis in subduction zones (e.g., Ma, 2012; Ma and Hirakawa, 2013; Ma and Nie, 2019; Wilson and Ma, 2021).\nEffects of fault bends on rupture dynamics have been widely investigated by modeling simple bends (e.g., Kase and Day, 2006; Oglesby et al., 2008; Duan and Day, 2008; Lozos et al., 2011) or faults with fractal roughness (e.g., Dunham et al., 2011; Shi and Day, 2013) with or without off-fault plasticity. Most models showed acute sensitivities of rupture velocity with restraining and releasing bends under certain uniform regional stress fields, shedding important insights on the physics of earthquake rupture and generation of high-frequency ground motion. The aforementioned models, however, did not study the effects of inelastic deformation at fault bends on surface deformation, which is the focus of this work.\nIn the following, I will first show dynamic rupture models on vertical strike-slip faults without ocean to demonstrate the efficient surface uplift produced by inelastic off-fault deformation at restraining bends. Fully-coupled models of dynamic rupture, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunami (e.g., Lotto and Dunham, 2015; Lotto et al., 2017, 2018; Wilson and Ma, 2021; Krenz et al., 2021) are then presented to show the large tsunami produced by this mechanism in a shallow bay.\n\n\n2\nDynamic rupture models without ocean\nI consider dynamic rupture on a vertical left-lateral strike-slip fault with a major restraining bend (Fig. 1\n). The coordinate system shown is used throughout in this paper. The bend geometry is specified by \nx\n=\n\nW\n2\n\ncos\n\n\n\n\u03c0\nL\n\n\n\ny\n\u2212\n\nL\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n, where W and L are the width and length of the bend, with the bend center at surface located at the origin. The bend angle varies smoothly in space, from 0 at the two boundaries with the planar fault sections to the maximum at the center, denoted by \u03b8. The bend length can be shown to relate to \u03b8 by \nL\n=\n\n\u03c0W\n\n2\ntan\u03b8\n\n\n. The bend width is fixed in this work: W\u00a0=\u00a03.5 km. Two bend angles are considered: \u03b8=30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, for which the bend length is L\u00a0=\u00a09.5224 km and 5.4978 km, respectively. Results below will focus on the geometry with \u03b8=30\u00b0 unless otherwise noted. These models are generic and can be easily extended to other bend geometries.\nThe fault is embedded in a homogeneous half space (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a02670 kg\/m3, V\n\nP\n\u00a0=\u00a06000 m\/s, and V\n\nS\n\u00a0=\u00a03464 m\/s, where \u03c1, V\n\nP\n, and V\n\nS\n are density and P- and S-wave speeds, respectively). The fault is 15\u00a0km wide and reaches the free surface. The fault length along y-axis is 60\u00a0km. The hypocenter is located at y\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0km and z\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210\u00a0km.\nI assume a uniform regional stress field. The vertical principal stress is lithostatic stress minus hydrostatic pore pressure, i.e., \u03c3\n\nV\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3\n\nzz\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03c1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03c1\n\nw\n)gz, where \u03c1\n\nw\n is water density and g is gravitational acceleration (9.8\u00a0m\/s2). The continuum mechanics convention is used, i.e., compressive stress is negative. All the normal stresses are effective stresses in this paper. The maximum horizontal compressive stress \u03c3\n\nHmax\n makes an angle (\u03c8) with respect to y-axis (Fig. 1a). To specify the two horizontal principal stresses: \u03c3\n\nHmax\n and \u03c3\n\nHmin\n (the minimum horizontal compressive stress), a critical stress solution is derived in the Appendix, based on the Drucker-Prager yield criterion (Drucker and Prager, 1952)\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\ns\nij\n\n\ns\nij\n\n\n\n\u2264\nc\n\ncos\u03d5\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\nkk\n\u2217\n\n3\n\nsin\u03d5\n\n\nwhere s\n\nij\n is the deviatoric stress tensor, an asterisk denotes effective stress, c is cohesion, and \u03d5 is internal friction angle. The simple derivation in the Appendix is similar to Dahlen's (1984) solution for a critical cohesionless accretionary wedge. The critical stress concept was also proposed for the continental crust (e.g., Zoback and Townend, 2001). Here the use of critical stress state is motivated by the intense internal deformation within restraining bends during interseismic period that may drive the material to the verge of failure. This is only one simple way to set up the initial stress conditions, to investigate the effect of inelastic off-fault deformation. We will see that it is the local stress field around the bend that plays an important role in surface deformation. The critical stress solution outside the bend is not important because most inelastic deformation occurs around the bend.\nThe critical stress solution requires internal friction angle \u03d5 and the initial frictional coefficient on the fault \n\n\u03bc\n0\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c3\nN\n\n\n, where \u03c4 and \u03c3\n\nN\n are initial shear and normal stresses on the fault. I assume tan\u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.75 and \u03bc\n0\u00a0=\u00a00.4 (on the planar sections of the fault), which are identical to the parameters in Ma (2008) and Ma and Andrews (2010).\nIn a transpressive stress regime, the maximum compressive stress is \u03c3\n\nHmax\n. However, the minimum compressive stress does not have to be \u03c3\n\nHmin\n, but can instead be \u03c3\n\nV\n due to enhanced horizontal compression, similar to a thrust setting. I choose \u03c8 to be <30\u00b0. For large angle \u03c8 restraining bends easily stop the rupture. The small \u03c8 mimics transpressive environments due to oblique plate convergence and possibly strike-slip faults with well-developed damage zones (e.g., Faulkner et al., 2006). Two cases are considered in this work: \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 and \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0. For \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 the critical stress solution gives \u03c3\n\nHmin\n\u00a0=\u00a01.1112\u03c3\n\nV\n and \u03c3\n\nHmax\n\u00a0=\u00a02.7298\u03c3\n\nV\n, thus the minimum compressive stress is vertical. For a slightly different angle \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0, the critical stress solution gives \u03c3\n\nHmin\n\u00a0=\u00a00.8599\u03c3\n\nV\n and \u03c3\n\nHmax\n\u00a0=\u00a02.4010\u03c3\n\nV\n, i.e., the minimum compressive stress becomes horizontal, which is a strike-slip state. Again, these stress conditions are most appropriate locally around the transpressional bend; outside the bend these stresses may be less applicable but unimportant due to small induced inelastic off-fault deformation. All three principal stresses are linearly depth-dependent. The details of these solutions are given in the Appendix. We will see below that these different orientations of principal stresses can play an important role in the effect of inelastic deformation on surface uplift around the bend.\nThe stress field in the domain is completely determined by the three principal stresses specified above. The shear and normal stresses on fault can be obtained by rotating the two horizontal principal stresses. Fig. 2\n shows these stresses for \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 and \u03b8=30\u00b0, which is the main model to be discussed below. Both the shear and normal stresses increase within the bend due to more optimal orientations of the bend with respect to \u03c3\n\nHmax\n (Fig. 2c). The most optimal orientation of the fault is shown by the tangent line in Fig. A1. Within the bend the fault rotates smoothly from the bend boundary to a more optimal angle with respect to \u03c3\n\nHmax\n initially, and the angle becomes less optimal at the center of the bend and then more optimal again on the other side of the bend. The initial friction coefficient therefore has two symmetric peaks and a central trough within the bend (Figs. 1b and 2d). This variation is due to the smooth cosine geometry profile used. The more optimal orientations of the fault bend will be shown below to easily lead to supershear rupture. If a straight fault bend is used the more optimal orientation of the bend also leads to a larger ratio of resolved shear to normal stresses, but large strain localizations can occur at sharp bend boundaries (e.g., Duan and Day, 2008).\nI use a time-weakening friction law on the fault to model dynamic rupture propagation (Andrews, 2004). The friction law is similar to a slip-weakening friction law, but with variable critical slip-weakening distances to well resolve stress breakdown at rupture front. The stress breakdown is as abrupt as possible in a given numerical scheme. I assume a constant static frictional coefficient \u03bc\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a00.6 and dynamic frictional coefficient \u03bc\n\nd\n\u00a0=\u00a00.3, same as in Ma (2008) and Ma and Andrews (2010). At the rupture front stress drops linearly from static friction to dynamic friction over a time interval t\n\nc\n = 0.08\u00a0s, an interval for S-wave to travel ~2.8 elements (element size is described below). The S ratio, defined by the ratio of strength excess to dynamic stress drop (e.g., Andrews, 1976), equivalent to \nS\n=\n\n\n\n\u03bc\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bc\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n0\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bc\nd\n\n\n\n, is 2 on the planar fault sections to avoid supershear rupture. However, within the bend the S ratio is smaller due to the increase of \u03bc\n0 from the more optimal orientation of fault bend (Figs. 1b and 2d). To avoid abrupt rupture stopping at fault bottom and lateral boundaries I smoothly increase \u03bc\n\nd\n to \u03bc\n\ns\n to induce negative stress drops (Fig. 2b, d). Near the free surface, I also increase \u03bc\n\nd\n to \u03bc\n\ns\n smoothly between ~2\u20134\u00a0km depth (Fig. 2b) to mimic the shallow velocity-strengthening behavior of fault zone materials (e.g., Scholz, 1998). The rupture is nucleated by forcing a rupture velocity of 2000\u00a0m\/s from the hypocenter with stress drop from initial friction to dynamic friction over 10 timesteps, and it then propagates spontaneously shortly afterwards with a faster velocity.\nThe Drucker-Prager yield criterion (eq. 1) is used to model inelastic deformation off the fault. The pressure dependence of yield strength in this criterion promotes inelastic failure at shallow depths due to low confining pressure, forming a \u2018flower-like\u2019 damage zone (e.g., Ma, 2008; Ma and Andrews, 2010). In this work, this yield criterion will be shown to give rise to positive flower structures at restraining bends, which are widely observed in transpressive fault zones.\nThe critical stress solution assumes cohesionless material. In the dynamic rupture models, I add cohesion to move the initial stress away from a critical state while keeping the stresses unchanged. An initial closeness-to-failure (CF) parameter is defined\n\n(2)\n\nCF\n=\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\ns\nij\n0\n\n\ns\nij\n0\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\nc\n\ncos\u03d5\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\nkk\n\n\u2217\n,\n0\n\n\n3\n\nsin\u03d5\n\n\n\n\nwhere the superscript 0 denotes initial stress, which is between 0 and 1. I specify the CF in the model, which determines the cohesion according to eq. 2 as all the stresses and internal frictional angle are obtained previously. For simplicity, CF is only a function of y (i.e., invariant with x) because inelastic off-fault deformation occurs mostly near the fault. The CF is assumed to be larger (i.e., closer to failure) for material within the bend due to more intense internal deformation expected over geological time. The CF outside the bend (CF\n\nplane\n) is fixed to be 0.7 in all inelastic cases. Different CFs within the bend (CF\n\nbend\n) are chosen from 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, to 0.95 to investigate how inelastic deformation affects surface uplift. A smooth transition from CF\n\nbend\n to CF\n\nplane\n is specified over a distance of 5\u00a0km outside both sides of the bend. In the elastic case both CF\n\nbend\n and CF\n\nplane\n are 0, implying infinite cohesion so inelastic deformation does not occur.\nThe undrained material response is incorporated in the model, which can significantly affect inelastic off-fault deformation (e.g., Viesca et al., 2008). I assume Skemption's coefficient B\u00a0=\u00a00.6 and Biot's coefficient \u03b1=0.5. Yielding is allowed in shear only, assuming no inelastic dilatancy or compaction (e.g., Andrews, 2005). When yielding occurs each deviatoric stress component is reduced by a common factor to meet the yield criterion (e.g., Andrews, 2005; Ma and Andrews, 2010). The stress adjustments represent the volume density of seismic moment tensor off the fault, mimicking frictional sliding on microfractures. The model is very similar to the 3D subduction zone model of Ma and Nie (2019).\nA finite-element code is used for dynamic rupture modeling, which has been extensively tested in the Southern California Earthquake Center Code Verification Exercises (e.g., Harris et al., 2018). The finite-element mesh consists of 4-node tetrahedral elements only. The fault is discretized by element size ~100\u00a0m. The mesh coarsens gradually to a remote boundary such that wave reflections from the boundary do not contaminate the solution. Each model is run for 50\u00a0s with a time step of 0.004\u00a0s to ensure that the domain of interest reaches final static equilibrium.\nAs a reference point for interpretating the inelastic models, I show the snapshots of slip velocity and shear stress change on fault and vertical surface velocity for a simulation with elastic off-fault response for the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 and \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 (Fig. 3\n). The rupture propagates spontaneously shortly after the nucleation. Because the dynamic stress drop increases linearly with depth the slip velocity also increases with depth. The rupture stops smoothly at bottom and lateral boundaries due to the specified negative stress drops, and propagates predominantly along negative y direction with a subshear rupture velocity. Despite the negative stress drop specified at shallow depths the rupture reaches the free surface and a small reflected phase by the free surface can be seen after the rupture front. When the rupture enters the bend a supershear rupture front is clearly developed, which results from the higher initial frictional coefficient due to the overall more optimal orientation of the bend (Figs. 1b and 2d). A shear Mach front can be clearly seen on the vertical ground velocity. A pronounced fault region with large shear stress increase near the surface edge of the bend is seen, due to large dynamic compression at the bend and the increase of dynamic friction specified at shallow depths (Fig. 1b). We will see in the subsequent inelastic simulations that the large shear stress increase in this region promotes off-fault failure. A larger stress stop is seen below this feature due to the overall larger \u03bc\n0 and initial normal stresses within the bend (Figs. 2c, d), which leads to larger slip (see Fig. 4a).\nThe slip distribution and rupture time contours every 1\u00a0s on the fault for this elastic simulation are illustrated in Fig. 4a. The subshear rupture before and supershear rupture after entering the bend can be clearly seen in the rupture time contours. The rupture time contours indicate that the rupture goes supershear near the surface. This is due to small normal stress and static friction at shallow depths, which is a minor feature. Due to negative stress drops shallow supershear rupture barely affects the rupture at depth. The slip distribution and rupture time contours in the case of a planar fault (without the bend) are shown in Fig. S1a. Only subshear rupture is seen along the entire fault at depth.\nThe surface displacements with and without bend in the elastic case are shown in Figs. 5a and S2a. The peak surface uplift is 0.59\u00a0m and 0.38\u00a0m with and without bend, respectively. In the planar fault case, the peak surface uplift is on the compressional side and near the boundary of the fault. The small uplift for the planar fault is consistent with the notion that vertical strike-slip earthquakes produce predominantly horizontal but small vertical motion. In the nonplanar case, the peak uplift is within the bend due to increased compression, as expected. However, when the material response is elastic the increase of uplift is still limited. This model is similar to most elastic dislocation models for tsunamigenesis by strike-slip earthquakes mentioned earlier.\nAs the CF in the bend increases, the slip remains largely unchanged over most of the fault except for near the surface edge of the bend where the slip diminishes (Fig. 4), which is due to more deformation occurring off the fault inelastically (e.g., Ma and Nie, 2019; Wilson and Ma, 2021). This is the same region with a large shear stress increase on the fault (Fig. 3). The increase of shear stress due to large dynamic compression and increase of dynamic friction coefficient, along with dynamic pore pressure increase at the bend, promote off-fault failure. As a result, surface uplift increases significantly with CF\n\nbend\n, resulting in a localized pop-up structure (Figs. 5 and 6\n). The peak surface uplift increases from 0.66\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.7), 0.89\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.8), 1.19\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.9), to 1.34\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95). The ratio of peak uplifts between CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95 and CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.0 (elastic case) reaches 2.27. Fig. 7\n shows the fault-parallel and vertical surface displacements at a cross section through the center of the fault bend. The increase of surface uplift (both peak amplitude and volume) and decrease of relative displacements across the fault due to inelastic deformation are more clearly seen.\nThe higher efficiency of producing uplift by inelastic deformation can also be clearly seen even along a planar fault (Fig. S2). Located near the boundary of the fault the peak uplift increases from 0.38\u00a0m (CF =\u00a00.0) to 0.60\u00a0m (CF =\u00a00.95), an increase of 57.89%. The peak uplift for each CF is seen on the compressional side of the fault because the inelastic deformation occurs on the compressional side of the fault when the angle \u03c8 is small (e.g., Viesca et al., 2008). The large inelastic uplift in this planar fault case is less localized than the fault bend case, as expected.\nThe physics for the increase of uplift with CF is same as in the inelastic wedge deformation models in subduction zones (e.g., Ma, 2012; Ma and Hirakawa, 2013; Ma and Nie, 2019; Wilson and Ma, 2021). The higher efficiency of producing uplift by inelastic deformation is due to frictional sliding on conjugate microfractures with a thrust component modeled by plastic flow. In the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0, the minimum compressive stress is vertical. If S\n1, S\n2, and S\n3 are three principal deviatoric stresses in an ascending order, we have |S\n2|\u00a0<\u00a0\u00a0min\u00a0(|S\n1|,|S\n3|) due to S\n1\u00a0+\u00a0S\n2\u00a0+\u00a0S\n3\u00a0=\u00a00. During plastic yielding modeled by the Drucker-Prager yield criterion, because each deviatoric stress is adjusted by a common factor the minimum adjustment among three of them is always in S\n2. Therefore, the stress adjustments in S\n3 are always larger than S\n2, which is volume density of the moment tensor component m\n\nzz\n that produces the inelastic uplift. In the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0, the minimum compressive stress is horizontal. The direction of S\n2 is vertical, therefore inelastic deformation (plastic flow) produces small uplift, but more horizontal motion.\nA pronounced flower structure can be seen for CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95 (Fig. 8\n). The inelastic zone widens significantly as the free surface is approached, which is due to lower confining pressure and yield strength near the surface (e.g., Ma, 2008; Ma and Andrews, 2010). The inelastic zone is mostly localized within the restraining bend because of the larger CF within the bend as well as large dynamic stress concentrations and pore pressure increase produced by rupture propagation. Along with the inelastic surface uplift the inelastic zone forms a distinct positive flower structure. A much smaller inelastic zone is seen outside the bend due to a lower CF.\nWhen the bend geometry changes to \u03b8 = 45\u00b0, the fault bend is severely misoriented with the maximum compressive stress such that the initial fault friction within the bend is lower than dynamic friction (Fig. S3). The rupture stops naturally within the bend in each CF case (Fig. S4). However, dynamic compression within the bend still produces significant inelastic uplift (Figs. S5 and S6). The peak uplift increases 77.42% from 0.31\u00a0m (elastic case) to 0.55\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95). A smaller positive flower structure is seen (Fig. S7).\nWhen the orientation of the maximum compressive stress changes to \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0 the stress state is a strike-slip type with a horizontal minimum compressive stress. The restraining bend is more optimally oriented with respect to the regional stress field than for \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0. For \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, there are two larger peaks of initial friction coefficient within the bend (Fig. S8), which leads to supershear rupture more easily after the rupture enters the bend and larger stress drop and slip within the bend than in the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 (Fig. S9). For a planar fault, except at shallow depths the rupture remains subshear on the fault (Fig. S10), as in the \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 case. However, as the CF increases the peak uplift does not increase as efficiently as in the \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 case. In the case of a planar fault (without bend) the peak uplift changes from 0.28\u00a0m (elastic case) to 0.37\u00a0m (CF =\u00a00.95) with an increase of only 28.37% (Fig. S11). With the restraining bend the peak uplift changes from 0.73\u00a0m (elastic case) to 1.03\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95) increasing only 41.10% (Figs. S12\u201314), much smaller than in the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0. This is largely due to the direction of the minimum compressive stress being horizontal, as discussed earlier. Inelastic off-fault deformation and plastic flow generate more horizontal motion, resulting in broader but smaller uplift. A similar positive flower structure can be seen in Fig. S15.\nThe smaller \u03c8 also allows the rupture to pass through larger restraining bends. For \u03b8 = 45\u00b0, the initial friction at the center of the bend is no longer smaller than dynamic friction (Fig. S16). The rupture jumps to supershear within the bend, again due to more optimal orientation of the bend. A clear reduction of fault slip near the surface edge of the bend is also seen due to inelastic off-fault deformation (Fig. S17). Although inelastic deformation promotes more horizontal displacement the large bend angle and small bend length creates a space problem in this case, causing efficient generation of local uplift (Figs. S18\u201320). The peak uplift increases from 0.45\u00a0m (elastic case) to 0.90\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95), a factor of 2 increase. A similar positive flower structure is shown in Fig. S21.\n\n\n3\nFully-coupled models of dynamic rupture and tsunami with a shallow bay\nHaving demonstrated the efficiency of generating uplift by inelastic deformation at restraining bends, it remains to show that this mechanism is relevant in tsunami generation. To this aim, I add a narrow and shallow bay (Fig. 9\n) in the model and consider the full coupling of dynamic rupture in the solid Earth and ocean acoustic waves and tsunami in the bay.\nThe geometry of the bay is idealized and similar to the one used in Elbanna et al. (2021), and is given by\n\n(3)\n\nz\n=\n\u2212\nh\n\nx\ny\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nh\n0\n\n+\n\nh\n1\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nh\n0\n\n\u2212\n\nh\n1\n\n\n2\n\ntanh\n\n\n\nx\n\n\u2212\nw\n\nc\n\n,\n\n\u2212\n5\n\u2264\ny\n\u2264\n50\n\nkm\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nh\n0\n\n+\n\nh\n1\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nh\n0\n\n\u2212\n\nh\n1\n\n\n2\n\ntanh\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\ny\n+\n5\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\nw\n\nc\n\n,\n\ny\n<\n\u2212\n5\n\nkm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere h(x,\ny) is depth of the bay (positive downward) and the maximum and minimum depth of the bay is h\n0\u00a0=\u00a00.7 km and h\n1\u00a0=\u00a00.05 km, respectively, and two parameters defining the transition from h\n0 to h\n1 are w= 3\u00a0km and c= 0.4\u00a0km. There is a semi-circular apex region at y\u00a0<\u00a0\u22125\u00a0km with a radius of 5\u00a0km delimiting the bay. The bay is 10\u00a0km wide north of the apex region and extends to y\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0km. A small linear taper of 15\u00b0 dipping from the edge of the bay is used to decrease the bay depth to 0 at the coastline (Fig. 9b); the width of the taper can be shown to be \n\n\nh\n1\n\n\ntan\n\n15\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n.\nFour fully-coupled models are considered: (I) a subshear rupture on a planar fault with elastic off-fault response, (II) a supershear rupture on a planar fault with elastic off-fault response, (III) rupture on a fault with a restraining bend (\u03b8 = 30\u00b0) and elastic off-fault response, and (IV) rupture on a fault with a restraining bend (\u03b8 = 30\u00b0) and inelastic off-fault response (CF\n\nplane\n\u00a0=\u00a00.7 and CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95). The material properties of the solid, fault geometry, hypocenter location, and frictional parameters are same as those in the previous section except that top part of the volume is cut away by the bay. The density and P-wave speed of the ocean are 1000\u00a0kg\/m3 and 1500\u00a0m\/s, respectively. The S-wave speed vanishes in the ocean.\nThe maximum compressive stress direction in all four models is fixed at \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0. Thus, Models I, III, and IV are same as the models shown in Figs. S1a, 4a and 4e, respectively, except for the presence of the bay. Model II was not considered previously. This model is identical to model I except that the static frictional coefficient on the fault is changed to \u03bc\n\ns\n = 0.45, which gives rise to a S ratio of 0.5 leading to supershear rupture over the entire fault. All other parameters, including dynamic stress drops, between these two models are identical. For simplicity, the initial stresses in the solid domain are calculated in the same way as in the previous section, i.e., the presence of the shallow bay in specifying these stresses is ignored.\nThe coupling between the solid and ocean is done by enforcing the continuity of normal displacement and normal traction and vanishing shear traction at the seafloor, i.e., the tangential displacement is discontinuous. The gravity waves are simulated by using a linearized sea surface boundary condition derived by Lotto and Dunham (2015), which is validated by a semi-analytical solution in Wilson and Ma (2021). The models are very similar to the fully-coupled models of Wilson and Ma (2021), except that the models presented here are in 3D. To generate finite-element meshes I discretize the fault and seafloor by an element size ~100\u00a0m and the ocean by ~25\u00a0m for all four models. Only 4-node tetrahedral elements are used. Each model is run for 100\u00a0s with a time step 0.004\u00a0s.\nIn the fully-coupled models the fault nodes at the seafloor are not allowed to slip, which removes the discontinuity in seafloor deformation at the fault trace. This causes only small differences on seafloor deformation compared to the previous results without ocean due to the specified negative stress drops at shallow depths. If the fault nodes at seafloor are indeed allowed to slip a triple junction arises at each point because tangential displacement at the seafloor is also discontinuous, which unnecessarily complicates the model. Sharp displacement discontinuities at seafloor do not produce tsunami as any wavelengths shorter than ocean depth are removed by the nonhydrostatic response of the ocean (Kajiura, 1963).\nThe slip distributions and rupture time contours for the four models are shown in Fig. 10\n. The snapshots of 3-component ground displacement at 5, 10, 15, and 100\u00a0s for the four models are illustrated in Fig. S22\u201324. The Mach front of model II due to supershear rupture is clearly seen. The rupture speed of model I stays subshear (Figs. S22\u201324 and 10a). Despite different rupture speeds the surface displacement at 100\u00a0s and slip distributions between models I and II are nearly identical because the dynamic stress drops in these two models are the same. These results are nearly identical to the model without ocean (Figs. S1a and S2a). The same applies to models III and IV, which are nearly identical to the models shown in Figs. 4 \u2013 6. The presence of the bay only affects slip distribution and surface deformation slightly due to the shallowness of the bay. Broad elastic surface uplift in model III and more localized and larger inelastic surface uplift in model IV are produced after the rupture passes through the restraining bend. The large inelastic uplift in model IV is associated with diminishing shallow slip on the fault (Fig. 10d), as shown previously. In these fully-coupled results, due to the presence of the ocean (with wave reverberations within the narrow bay and slowly propagating tsunami) the seafloor deformation still fluctuates slightly at 100\u00a0s (long after the rupture stops). To simplify the discussion, I will treat the ground surface displacements at 100\u00a0s as final static displacements below.\nThe three components of permanent seafloor deformation are detailed in Fig. 11\n. The similarities between models I and II and differences between models III and IV discussed above can be more clearly seen. The peak static uplift in the four models is 0.25, 0. 27, 0.50, and 1.42\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 11c). Also shown in Fig. 11d is the seafloor uplift by including the contribution of horizontal displacement of seafloor slope (Tanioka and Satake, 1996), which is given by\n\n(4)\n\n\nu\n\nt\ns\n\n\n=\n\nu\nz\n\n+\n\nu\nx\n\n\n\n\u2202\nh\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n+\n\nu\ny\n\n\n\n\u2202\nh\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n\n\nwhere u\n\nx\n, u\n\ny\n, and u\n\nz\n is permanent seafloor displacement along x, y, and z, respectively. The width of the seafloor uplift contributed by the horizontal displacement (Figs. 11a, b) is directly related to the width of seafloor slope shown in Fig. 9, which is ~1.2\u00a0km. There is no contribution in the center of the bay because the bay bottom is flat. The physics underlying the contribution of horizontal displacement in tsunamigenesis is simply due to the continuity of normal displacement at the seafloor. If the seafloor slope moves towards the ocean, it contributes to uplift of the ocean; it lowers the ocean when the seafloor slope moves away from the ocean. The blue and red patterns around the edge of the bay (directly above the seafloor slope) can be understood by relating to the two horizontal displacements shown in Figs. 11a and b. Notably, the horizontal displacement contribution is largest near the edge of the apex region due to the large strike-slip motion in all four models. The peak uplift by including the contribution of horizontal displacement reaches 0.93, 1.09, 1.42, and 1.94\u00a0m, respectively, all at the apex edge (Fig. 11d). Clearly, the seafloor uplift due to horizontal displacement of seafloor slope is the dominant feature in models I and II, which has much shorter wavelength than the uplift around the bend in models III and IV. We will see below that tsunami in the fully-coupled models are closely related to the seafloor uplift pattern shown in Fig. 11d.\nThe snapshots of sea surface height for the four models are shown in Fig. 12\n, illustrating the evolutions of ocean acoustic waves and tsunami in the narrow-shallow bay. More details can be seen in Movie S1 in the Supplementary Materials. A 4th-order Butterworth lowpass filter with cutoff wavelength of 1\u00a0km is applied (to ensure 10 elements per wavelength) because a relatively coarse mesh resolution (~100\u00a0m) is used at the seafloor. Clear ocean acoustic waves are produced by the propagation of rupture on the fault and these waves reverberate within the bay for a long time. The rupture front passes the apex region of the bay within about 10\u00a0s in all four models (Fig. 10). Stronger ocean acoustic waves from model II can be seen at 5\u00a0s, which are associated with large S-wave radiation of the Mach front (Figs. S22\u201324). However, after the rupture propagates out of the bay the wave amplitude differences between models I and II are nearly indistinguishable. The horizontal displacements of sloping seafloor generate most of the tsunami in these two models, slowly propagating into the bay from left and right edges (barely seen in this figure), and most notably from the apex region of the bay. However, the tsunami in the apex region quickly attenuates due to geometric spreading. The tsunami is well correlated with the static seafloor uplift pattern shown in Fig. 11d. The amplitude of the tsunami in both models appear very small (~ 0.1\u00a0m), which is due to the small permanent uplift caused by strike-slip motion and relatively small contributions from the horizontal displacement in the models. Supershear rupture does not appear to produce larger tsunami than subshear rupture in these fully-coupled models.\nModels III and IV show significantly different results. Large tsunami results from the uplift in the middle of the bay after the rupture passes through the restraining bend. The sea surface height at 15\u00a0s closely matches the seafloor uplift amplitude in Fig. 11d. The splitting of the tsunami around the bend and propagation away from the bend can be clearly seen after ~15\u00a0s. The tsunami propagates approximately perpendicular to the fault bend affected slightly by the bathymetry, causing large impact on the left and right shorelines; much weaker propagation is seen parallel to the fault. A large tsunami is also seen generated from the apex edge of the bay, due to a larger horizontal displacement in these two models resulting from larger stress drop within the bend (Fig. 11d). Interestingly, in the apex region to the right of the fault sea surface first drops due to broad seafloor subsidence (Fig. 11c) and then rises due to the inward motion of the sloping seafloor. The tsunami interferes constructively with the downward-propagating tsunami produced by the bend uplift, causing large tsunami amplitude in the apex region and surrounding coast. This constructive interference is not seen in models I and II. The amplitude of the tsunami correlates very well with the amplitude of static seafloor deformation shown in Fig. 11d. The tsunami in model IV appears more localized and has more than twice the amplitude than the tsunami in model III, confirming the efficiency of tsunamigenesis by inelastic off-fault deformation at the restraining bend.\nThe space-time plots of sea surface height at four horizontal cross sections (y\u00a0=\u00a020, 10, 0, \u22125\u00a0km) are illustrated in Figs. 13 \u2013 16\n\n\n\n. Clearer reverberations of ocean acoustic waves and different tsunami amplitudes and speeds can be seen more clearly. Static seafloor uplift with and without the contribution from horizontal displacement at each cross section is also shown.\nIn models I and II, due to the symmetry of the model seafloor deformation and sea surface height are antisymmetric with respect to the fault trace (x\u00a0=\u00a00). In all the cross sections, clear seaward tsunamis are generated by the horizontal displacement of seafloor slope, which have short wavelengths related to the width of the seafloor slope (~1.2\u00a0km). The tsunami speed is less than, but very close to the shallow-water limit \n\n\ng\n\nh\n0\n\n\n\n due to dispersion of short-wavelength tsunami (the dispersive signals are not well resolved in the model here due to relatively coarser mesh resolution at the seafloor). The landward tsunami produced by the horizontal displacement of sloping seafloor can also be seen, with a slower speed due to decreasing bay depth. The broad seafloor uplift and subsidence on two sides of the fault due to the earthquake generate broad sea surface rise and drop, which are essentially long-wavelength tsunami traversing across the bay; these long-wavelength tsunamis cancel each other perfectly at x\u00a0=\u00a00. The tsunami is seen propagating away from the fault due to the vertical seafloor change across the fault, which are the wavefronts of these long-wavelength tsunamis (Figs. 14 \u2013 16). These different tsunamis are superimposed (linearly) in the bay together with ocean acoustic waves, resulting a complex pattern. Nonetheless, the tsunamis in models I and II appear very similar and small.\nThe presence of fault bend breaks the symmetry in models III and IV. Distinct short-wavelength tsunamis from horizontal seafloor displacement and broad sea surface drop and rise due to seafloor subsidence and uplift can also be clearly seen. At y\u00a0=\u00a00, the tsunami produced by the uplift at the restraining bend is clearly illustrated (Fig. 15). The tsunami amplitude above the bend is well above 1\u00a0m in model IV, more than twice as large as in model III. The tsunami propagates away from the central uplift region with decreasing speed and increasing amplitude, due to the decreasing ocean depth towards the shoreline. The tsunami amplitude near the shoreline reaches ~0.3\u00a0m in model III and\u00a0~\u00a00.8\u00a0m in model IV. Nonlinearity, sea bottom friction, and runup are not included in the simulations here, so the actual tsunami heights in a real shallow bay will be much larger. The shorter-wavelength inelastic uplift produces more localized tsunami in model IV than the elastic uplift in model III. The tsunami amplitude correlates very well with the static seafloor uplift. Fig. 16 shows the cross section at y\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125\u00a0km, displaying more of the interferences in the apex region between the tsunamis produced at the fault bend and the apex edge of the bay.\n\nFig. 17\n shows the sea surface height time histories at cross section y\u00a0=\u00a00. Larger tsunamis in models III and IV and small tsunami in models I and II are evident. Clear ocean acoustic waves are also seen, with much shorter periods than the tsunami. Note the faster arrival and larger amplitude of ocean acoustic waves due to supershear rupture in model II. However, the wave amplitudes are very similar after 10\u00a0s between models I and II. Similar patterns can be seen in time histories at the other three cross sections (Figs. S25\u201327).\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nRestraining bends are well recognized in causing orogeny worldwide. Laboratory experiments also clearly showed uplift caused by inelastic off-fault deformation at restraining bends under slow loading (e.g., Cooke et al., 2013). Coseismic pop-up structures of various scales are widely observed (e.g., Hamling et al., 2017; Hananto et al., 2020), which are possible manifestations of inelastic off-fault deformation (e.g., Diederichs et al., 2019). Legg et al. (2003) recognized the importance of pop-up structures at restraining bends and stepovers in tsunamigenesis in a strike-slip setting, but later modeling work only considered elastic deformation (e.g., Borrero et al., 2004). The work here has shown that dynamic stresses caused by the earthquake rupture front induce coseismic off-fault failure at restraining bends, which results in more efficient and localized uplift than elastic dislocation models. The higher efficiency is due to frictional sliding on conjugate microfractures with a thrust component, which is the same physics causing orogeny. With significant inelastic off-fault deformation the slip at shallow depths is diminished. This can be an important mechanism for tsunamigenesis in a strike-slip environment, which supports the pop-up hypothesis of Legg et al. (2003) and Gusman et al. (2019).\nThis mechanism produces short-wavelength inelastic uplift, largely controlled by bend size, which can contribute significantly to tsunamigenesis in shallow water. The ocean depth acts as a low-pass filter to translate seafloor uplift to sea surface elevation in tsunami generation (Kajiura, 1963), therefore any wavelengths shorter than ocean depth are not tsunamigenic. The width of the restraining bend here (3.5\u00a0km) is considerably larger than the depth of typical shallow bays and lakes (e.g., the deepest point of Palu Bay is ~800\u00a0m), therefore the short-wavelength inelastic uplift presented here can be highly tsunamigenic, as shown in the fully-coupled models. Due to the short wavelength of uplift, the produced tsunami is likely localized, which can have a large impact in narrow bays and lakes, as possibly observed in Palu Bay.\nThe mechanism is similar to inelastic wedge deformation in subduction zones (e.g., Ma and Nie, 2019). Inelastic wedge deformation was shown to cause efficient tsunamigenesis with diminishing shallow slip on the fault, which is plausible to explain the puzzling large tsunami runup on the Sanriku coast >100\u00a0km north of the epicenter in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, while being consistent with the differential bathymetry observations (Fujiwara et al., 2017). The width of inelastic seafloor uplift in Ma and Nie (2019) is about 20\u201325\u00a0km, which are short-wavelength compared to most elastic dislocation models, but are much larger than ocean depth (~7\u20138\u00a0km) to be tsunamigenic. This inelastic uplift was shown to produce impulsive tsunami, similar to what was observed along the Sanriku coast in the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, and generate large runup remarkably consistent with the runup of the 1896 Sanriku tsunami (Du et al., 2021). Here this mechanism is extended to strike-slip environments. Inelastic deformation may be intimately involved in tsunamigenesis in different tectonic settings.\nThe models here assume that the material within restraining bends is close to failure, which is motivated by the intense internal deformation over geological time. This same concept was introduced in the critical wedge theory for accretionary plate margins (e.g., Dahlen, 1984) and was used in the aforementioned inelastic wedge deformation models in subduction zones. A critical stress solution in transpressional and transtentional environments is derived here and used to set up the initial stress field. The local stress field at the transpressional bend is what determines the generation of inelastic uplift. In other words, in an overall transtentional regime large tsunamigenesis can also occur due to this mechanism if the local stress field at the restraining bend is transpressive. The models here use a homogeneous material. Sediments can further enhance inelastic off-fault failure and surface uplift due to weak strength. Future work may incorporate sediments and use a more heterogeneous stress drop distribution on the fault and real bathymetry to simulate a real earthquake and tsunami.\nThe direction of the minimum compressive stress is shown to control the efficiency of inelastic uplift. When the minimum compressive stress is vertical locally at restraining bends, similar to a subduction setting, the efficiency of producing inelastic uplift is maximum. This stress condition is expected from intense compression at restraining bends over geological time. When the minimum compressive stress is horizontal, as in a typical strike-slip setting, inelastic deformation (plastic flow) induces more horizontal motion. Models assuming horizontal minimum compressive stress may underestimate the effect of inelastic deformation on tsunamigenesis in a local transpressional setting. However, large localized inelastic uplift can still occur if the bend angle is large (Fig. S19).\nSupershear rupture can develop at optimally-oriented restraining bends. Models here assume an acute angle of maximum compressive stress with respect to the fault, mimicking the strike-slip faults developed due to oblique plate convergence or possibly faults with well-developed damage zones. Supershear ruptures are seen even after the rupture passes a 45\u00b0 restraining bend. This indicates that large restraining bends may not always act as a strong barrier to earthquake rupture. Both supershear rupture and large tsunamigenesis are co-existent in the models here, but large tsunamigenesis is due to inelastic off-fault deformation at restraining bends. Fully coupled model of dynamic rupture, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunami in a narrow-shallow bay show that supershear strike-slip ruptures do not generate large tsunami; tsunami is only sensitive to static seafloor deformation. Large kinetic energy of supershear rupture is carried away by ocean acoustic waves.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nDynamic off-fault failure at restraining bends is shown as an efficient tsunami generation mechanism for strike-slip earthquakes. The inelastic uplift is due to frictional sliding on microfractures with a thrust component generated by dynamic failure, which produces larger and more localized uplift than the one produced by elastic dislocation models. The localized inelastic uplift can produce short-wavelength tsunami that significantly impact shallow and narrow bays and lakes.\nFully-coupled models of dynamic rupture, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunami demonstrate that tsunami is mostly sensitive to static seafloor deformation. Models incorporating 3D time-dependent seafloor deformation into tsunami while ignoring ocean acoustic waves may overestimate the tsunami in a narrow bay. Supershear earthquakes on a vertical planar strike-slip fault do not produce large tsunami.\nThe tsunami hazards in strike-slip environments worldwide are likely underestimated. The current understanding of tsunamigenesis in a strike-slip environment involves mostly only submarine landslides and horizontal displacement of steep bathymetry. The presence of restraining bends and stepovers, such as in the Southern California Borderland, is recognized (Legg et al., 2007), but the tsunami hazards they impose are largely ignored. Other similar offshore regions with fault complexities are widespread. The inelastic deformation mechanism at fault complexities may need to be urgently incorporated in the current tsunami hazard assessments in strike-slip environments.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\nSupplementary Video 1\n\nMovie of sea surface height for the four fully-coupled models showing clear ocean acoustic waves and various tsunamis.

Respective studies aim, for example, to determine a fault's geologic slip-rate (variation) and investigate the recurrence of earthquakes that release interseismically accumulated strain, using the tools from paleoseismology and tectonic geomorphology (with augmenting insights from historical accounts of earthquake occurrence and instrumental recordings of the earthquake cycle, as provided by seismic and geodetic data). Paleoseismic studies typically analyze deformed stratigraphic units, exposed via trench excavations, to constrain the time and size of past earthquakes at a specific site along a fault (e.g., Sieh et al., 1989; Grant and Sieh, 1994; Weldon et al., 2004; Zielke and Strecker, 2009; Ak\u00e7iz et al., 2010; Scharer et al., 2014). Tectono-geomorphic studies, on the other hand, commonly analyze tectonically displaced or deformed landforms, such as alluvial fans, river terraces, or channel beds, to constrain a fault's slip-rate and its slip accumulation pattern along larger stretches of a fault (e.g., Wallace, 1968; Sieh, 1978; McCalpin, 2009; Zielke et al., 2010; Klinger et al., 2011). Utilizing these approaches, a set of end-member models for earthquake recurrence and along-fault slip accumulation was postulated (e.g., Shimazaki and Nakata, 1980; Schwartz and Coppersmith, 1984; Youngs and Coppersmith, 1985; Sieh, 1996; Mouslopoulou et al., 2012) and finds application in seismic hazard assessment. Since then, numerous studies extended on this work and used fault slip and age data, spanning many different time scales (from a few thousands to millions of years), to produce fault growth and earthquake recurrence models that reconcile fault slip accumulation over a range of time scales (e.g., Friedrich et al., 2003; Nicol et al., 2005; Mouslopoulou et al., 2009; Carafa et al., 2022).\nWhile paleoseismic and tectono-geomorphic techniques dominate the tool set that is used to constrain the details of the earthquake cycle, other techniques exist. For example, measuring the concentration of cosmogenic radionuclides (CRNs) along the free face of bedrock fault scarps (for convenience, we will refer to \u201cfree faces of bedrock fault scarps\u201d as \u201cfault surfaces\u201d for the remainder of this text) may indicate the time and size of the scarp-forming earthquakes. So far, this approach has been mainly applied on limestone bedrock normal fault scarps, based on the observation that Ca produced 36Cl, an unstable cosmogenic nuclide, when exposed to cosmic radiation. The concentration of these CRNs is, among other factors, a function of exposure intensity and time (e.g., Dunai, 2010; Schimmelpfennig et al., 2009). Distinct changes in the 36Cl concentration along a fault surface's height may therefore indicate the occurrence of subsequent earthquakes (Fig. 1\n; e.g., Schlagenhauf et al., 2010; Benedetti et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2018; Tesson and Benedetti, 2019). Another relative dating technique that is aimed at identifying the number of paleoearthquakes on limestone fault surfaces is the rare earth element REE method. This method measures changes in the geochemistry across a fault surface (identifying the depletion and enrichment of certain elements due to fault surface exhumation and erosion; e.g., Manighetti et al., 2010; Mouslopoulou et al., 2011, 2014). Additional insight is provided by the Schmidt hammer method (Tye and Stahl, 2018; Stahl and Tye, 2020), revealing weathering contrasts in limestone fault scarps via its rebound values (R-values).\nIn the present study, we also aim to identify abrupt changes in fault surface exposure time and hence aim to identify the occurrence of past earthquakes (i.e., their slip increments) along bedrock fault scarps. The approach is motivated by qualitative field observations indicating that fault surface roughness (of exposed normal fault scarps) changes systematically with scarp height. For example, fault surfaces along the Mt. Vettore fault (central Italy) are rougher at higher portions of the fault scarp, relative to its lower portions (Fig. 1A). This fault ruptured most recently in 2016, exposing previously buried portions of the fault surface. Similar observations were made previously along this and other faults and were quantitatively documented, utilizing lidar or image-based approaches to measure a fault scarp's surface roughness (e.g., Giaccio et al., 2002; Reicherter et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2013; Bubeck et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; Mechernich et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2020; Corradetti et al., 2021).\nA positive relationship between fault surface roughness and surface age is expected, considering that the fault surface is exposed to persistent physical and chemical weathering. The underlying assumption of our study is therefore that prolonged exposure to (subaerial) weathering processes increase the roughness of a fault surface (Fig. 1; e.g., Giaccio et al., 2002; Mechernich et al., 2018; Corradetti et al., 2021). Further, assuming that roughness is homogeneous across the fault surface, we assign individual step-like changes in fault plane roughness to discrete exposure events (e.g., Mechernich et al., 2018). These exposure events may be the result of non-tectonic processes (e.g., climate-controlled, or gravity-induced) or tectonic processes (e.g., earthquakes). Given the precedence provided by 2016 earthquakes along the Mt. Vettore fault (causing fault surface exposure), we focus on the latter scenario. That is, if an initially homogenously rough fault surface is getting exposed sequentially due to the occurrence of subsequent earthquakes, then we may find distinct changes in fault roughness perpendicular to the (paleo-) ground surface if a) a sufficient amount of time has passed between subsequent earthquakes to create measurable changes in fault surface roughness, and b) a sufficient amount of slip has occurred during individual earthquakes to produce consistent roughness values along continuous portions of the fault surface (Fig. 1). The assumption of initially homogenous roughness across the fault surface is supported for the Mt. Vettore site, where the newly-exposed fault surface (exposed by the 2016 earthquakes) is indeed homogenously rough, without apparent, systematic roughness changes. It is further supported by lithological observations, indicating that the exposed fault surface spans a micritic, compact, and homogeneous Jurassic limestone without observable varying lithologic character (e.g., Pierantoni et al., 2013). Similar observations are made for the Roccapreturo site, where Cretaceous limestone is exposed.\nBased on this understanding, we analyze the roughness of bedrock fault surfaces along the Monte Vettore fault and Roccapreturo fault (Fig. 2\n) to resolve the slip increments of past earthquakes (e.g., Wei et al., 2013; He et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2020). Both faults feature sites with well-developed limestone fault scarps \u2013some of which investigated previously, therefore providing a contextual framework for our own investigation (e.g., Giaccio et al., 2002; Schlagenhauf, 2009; Falcucci et al., 2015; Galli et al., 2019; Cinti et al., 2019; Corradetti et al., 2021; Goodall et al., 2021). The two faults are located in the central Apennines (Italy), a NW-trending, ~400\u00a0km long and\u00a0~\u00a0100\u00a0km wide mountain range that undergoes NE-SW extension at a rate of 3\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr (D'Agostino, 2014). Extension is accommodated by 10\u201330\u00a0km long normal faults (such as the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo faults), arranged in several sub-parallel, segmented fault systems that are located along the ridge belt (Galadini and Galli, 2000; Vai and Martini, 2013). This belt has hosted to many destructive earthquakes over the last millennium (Rovida et al., 2021). The most recent earthquake activity occurred in 2016, when 9 successive shocks (M5\u2013M6.5) ruptured several portions of a\u00a0~\u00a060\u00a0km long fault system in less than half a year (e.g., Perouse et al., 2018 and references therein). Prominent surface ruptures, with maximum throws of 80\u2013130\u00a0cm, were observed along the Mt. Vettore fault after the largest shock of the sequence (M6.5) occurred on 30th October 2016 (Civico et al., 2018). Our first study site is located on this fault, near a place called Scoglio del'Aquila, where the 2016 coseismic surface displacement reached its maximum and where the fault surface (i.e., bedrock fault scarp) is particularly well expressed (Fig. 2A). Paleoseismic studies at other locations along the Mt. Vettore fault system revealed that at least seven surface faulting events (including the most recent ones in 2016) occurred within the past 22 kyrs, with an average return period of 3.6\u20131.2 kyr (Galladini and Galli, 2003; Galli et al., 2019; Cinti et al., 2019). To our knowledge, no incremental slip amount has been attributed to the individual earthquakes, preceding the most recent one(s).\nThe second study site is located along the Roccapreturo fault. This fault belongs to the Middle Aterno fault system, which is composed of several NW-SE trending, ~10\u201320\u00a0km long faults (Galadini and Galli, 2000). A range of morphological features (e.g., triangular facets, channel knickpoints, strong incision and alluvial fan development) along this fault segment indicate the fault's long-term (104\u2013105\u00a0yr) as well as recent (103\u2013104\u00a0yr) tectonic activity. The Quaternary activity of the Roccapreturo fault was shown also by Falcucci et al. (2015) who found early-Pleistocene continental deposits on both sides of the fault, being offset by ~270\u00a0m. Falcucci et al. (2015) further found paleoseismic evidence for at least two surface rupturing earthquakes since 7.5 kyrs ago, with an accumulated minimum offset of 1.8\u00a0m. Additionally, a CRN investigation by Goodall et al. (2021) suggested that the most recent earthquake occurred ~2.6 kyr ago. Following, we describe our data set and analysis approach before presenting our results.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nTo quantitatively investigate roughness variations across a fault surface, we adopt the structure-from-motion approach (e.g., Triggs et al., 1999; Lowe, 2004; Brown and Lowe, 2005; Johnson et al., 2014; Corradetti et al., 2017), enabling us to generate very high-resolution surface models by combining a large number of photographs that image the area of interest from many different angles. In total, 271 photos were acquired in November 2016 for the Mt. Vettore site (imaging two separate parts, I and II, of this fault surface) and 213 photos were acquired in 2019 for the Roccapreturo site. Additionally, one portion of the Mt. Vettore fault surface (part I) was also photographed in September 2016 (in-between the August and October earthquakes, 104 photos) and in June 2018 (108 photos). The resulting point clouds, covering areas of different sizes, contain more than 37 million data points (Mt. Vettore, part I, 11\/2016), 46 million data points (Mt. Vettore, part II, 11\/2016), 6 million data points (Mt. Vettore, part I, 09\/2016), 8 million data points (Mt. Vettore, part I, 06\/2018), and 22 million data points (Roccapreturo, 2019). The Mt. Vettore data sets, acquired in September and November 2016, are publicly available in Perouse et al. (2018).\nWe rotate the point clouds into local coordinate systems where the x\u2212\/y\u2212\/z-axis correspond to the along-strike\u2212\/along-dip\u2212\/out-of-plane direction. Next, we linearly interpolate the rotated point clouds to a grid, providing a uniformly spaced data set. We follow Hu et al.'s (2003) suggestion regarding the recommended grid size s which is informed by the data set's average observation point density in the area of interest (observations n per area A) and calculated as s\u00a0=\u00a0sqrt(A\/n). For all data sets, we have observation point densities in exceedance of 80\u00a0cm\u22122, indicating a permissible grid size of ~1\u00a0mm (Fig. 3\n).\nTo measure changes in fault surface roughness, we define a circle that is moved across the fault surface in 0.5\u00a0cm steps in strike- and dip direction (Fig. 4A). We use circles of three different sizes (2, 4, and 6\u00a0cm diameter) to ensure measurements consistency. For each step that the circle is moved across the fault surface, we collect all data points that fall within the circle. Hence, the 2-cm circle contains ~300 data points while the 4-cm and 6-cm circles contain ~1200 and\u00a0~\u00a02800 data points respectively. Next, we perform a principal component analysis on this circular subset to remove linear trends from its topography. This step requires for the circle's dimension to be distinctly larger than the topographic signal of the circular subset, indicating the existence of a lower limit for the circle's dimension, relative to the surface's roughness. If this requirement is met, then the first and second principal components define two in-plane coordinate axes, while the third principal component, being perpendicular to the first two, defines the local, detrended topography z of the circular subset.\nWe measure the roughness within each circle by calculating roughness metrics from topography z. In correspondence to choosing different circle sizes, we use three different local roughness metrics (namely the L2-norm, L4-norm, and the peak-to-valley method;\nGadelmawla et al., 2002; Santos and J\u00falio, 2013) to ensure measurement consistency. The peak-to-valley P2V roughness metric measures the absolute height difference between the highest and lowest point (value of z) within the circular subset, normalized by the circle's diameter D (EQ1; e.g., Gadelmawla et al., 2002). The L2-norm refers to the common root-mean-square approach for roughness quantification (EQ2; e.g., Power and Tullis, 1991; Santos and J\u00falio, 2013). The L4-norm (EQ3) differs from the L2-norm only in the power that is used, making the L4-norm in principle more sensitive to outliers i.e., more sensitive to roughness variations (Menke, 2012).\n\n(1)\n\nP\n2\nV\n=\n\n1\nD\n\n\n\n\nz\nmax\n\n\u2212\n\nz\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nL\n2\n\nnorm\n=\n\n1\nD\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\nz\ni\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nL\n4\n\nn\no\nrm\n=\n\n1\nD\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\nz\ni\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nBy moving the circle across the fault surface in small steps (0.5\u00a0cm), we typically generate hundreds of roughness measurements for each profile height. Given our assumption that subaerial weathering processes gradually increase fault surface roughness over time, we group the roughness measurements by profile height and then take a low-number percentile to represent the minimum fault roughness at that height (Fig. 4). As a result, we obtain low-roughness vs. height profiles (e.g., 1st and 5th percentile of L4-norm, Fig. 4B), smoothed with a causal (down-dip looking) moving average filter of 10-cm window size. The smoothed roughness profiles are then normalized to range from 0 to 1, respectively representing its minimum and maximum values. In correspondence to approaches taken in CRN studies, we compute histograms from the smoothed and normalized roughness profiles (Fig. 4B, bar plot). Here, histogram peaks indicate profile sections that share the same roughness character while histogram valleys between them indicate profile sections where roughness changes abruptly. The profile heights at which roughness begins to deviate away from the histogram peaks in the up-dip direction constitute event horizons, separating portions of the profile that were exposed to subaerial weathering before and after an exposure event (i.e., surface-rupturing earthquake; Fig. 4B, dashed lines and arrows). To better resolve the event horizon heights, we stack all the roughness profiles we obtained for a given circle size (i.e., stacking normalized profiles from different percentile values and roughness metrics) and analyze them collectively, along with the corresponding stacked histogram. This further reduces the data set's noise and helps focusing on signals (e.g., event horizons) that are consistent throughout our observations.\nNot all parts of the imaged surface represent the initial bedrock fault scarp (i.e., slickensides) whose degradation by persistent, gradual weathering processes we aim to resolve. Our surface models may contain areas where snow or plants cover the fault surface or where rocks have been plucked and dislodged from it, removing the original slickensides (e.g., upper left part of Fig. 3A, top and bottom part of Fig. 3B). We exclude these non-representative areas from the roughness analysis by defining polygons that outline the data set sections that we analyze (see auxiliary online material, Fig. S1).\n\n\n3\nResults\nFollowing the outlined approach, we analyze how fault roughness (i.e., its low-percentile representation) changes as a function of profile height at the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo sites. In total, we analyzed 5 sections of the fault surface at the Mt. Vettore site and 1 section at the Roccapreturo site (Fig. S1). As noted before, three of the Mt. Vettore sections are spatially overlapping, capturing part I of the fault surface (Fig. 3A) at three different times (09\/2016, 11\/2016, and 06\/2018; our measurements on the 09\/2016 and 06\/2018 data sets may be found in the auxiliary online material; Fig. S2). The other sections are spatially separated, covering different parts of the fault surface as documented by the 11\/2016 data set. Unfortunately, we were not able to take multiple measurements for the Roccapreturo site, where only one fault surface model is available. For each analyzed fault surface section, we provide three subplots (respectively for a 2-, 4-, 6-cm circle size), each of them containing 15 roughness profiles and a stacked roughness histogram (1st to 5th percentile for 3 roughness metrics; Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). Profile lines are semi-transparent to emphasize where they share similar values and overlap.\nFor section 1 of the Mt. Vettore fault surface, we identified five histogram peaks and hence five exposure event horizons (Fig. 5A). Three of them, at 0.0\u00a0m, 0.7\u00a0m, and 1.5\u00a0m, are distinctly larger than the other two at 0.9\u00a0m and 1.1\u00a0m. The smaller size of the latter two histogram peaks (the one at 0.9\u00a0m being the smallest) is due to the short profile sections (~20\u00a0cm) that exhibit this roughness character, which makes them presumably less reliable. However, our analysis of section 1, based on the 09\/2016 and 08\/2018 data sets (Fig. S2), indicates consistency between measurements \u2013even the weakly developed histogram peaks at 0.9\u00a0m and 1.1\u00a0m are found in the 09\/2016 and 06\/018 data sets, albeit at slightly shifted heights of 1.0\u00a0m and 1.3\u00a0m and 0.9\u00a0m and 1.2\u00a0m respectively (Fig. 5A and S2). This slight shift in height is caused by differences in polygon outlines (Fig. S1), combined with the curviness of the event horizons which is well exemplified for the most recent earthquakes (e.g., Figs. 2A and 3A). Further note that the 09\/2016 data set (Fig. S2A) also revealed a histogram peak at 1.8\u00a0m, which is not fully resolved in Fig. 5A because of this profile's limited length. The identified event horizon heights, reported relative to height of the August 2016 event horizon, are listed in Table 1\n.\nFor section 2 of the Mt. Vettore fault surface (Fig. 5B), we find four well developed histogram peaks, located at 0.0\u00a0m, 0.9\u00a0m, 1.2\u00a0m, and 1.7\u00a0m. The changes between profile sections with similar roughness character are overall sharp and discrete (i.e., step-like), especially for the smaller circle sizes (Fig. 5B, left and middle). Given the clear expression of the 0.9\u00a0m event horizon in section 2 (i.e., its histogram peak), relative to the corresponding one in section 1 (Fig. 5A), leads us to suggests that they are not related to the same exposure event. Instead, we suggest that the 0.9\u00a0m event horizon in section 2 correlates to the 0.7\u00a0m event horizon in section 1 and further suggest that the 0.9\u00a0m event horizon in section 1 is not resolved in section 2 (otherwise, the 0.7\u00a0m event horizon from section 1 is not resolved here). Likewise, we suggest that the 1.7\u00a0m event horizon in section 2 correlates to the 1.5\u00a0m event horizon in section 1.\nFor section 3 of the Mt. Vettore fault surface (Fig. 5C), we find three well developed histogram peaks, located at 0.0\u00a0m, 0.8\u00a0m, and 1.3\u00a0m, separated by sharp and step-like changes in roughness. Note that this profile is ~0.5\u00a0m shorter than those of section 1 and 2, therefore not capturing the higher event horizon at 1.5\u00a0m (i.e., 1.7\u00a0m). Following the same approach as for section 2 (based on relative expression of the step-like change in roughness and size of the associated histogram peak), we suggest that the 0.8\u00a0m event horizon in section 3 correlates to the 0.7\u00a0m event horizon in section 1.\nOverall, we find that the event horizon heights for the Mt. Vettore site (Table 1) are markedly similar across the different roughness metrics, percentile values, circle sizes, and analyzed fault surface sections, attesting for the consistency of these measurements. Including the 2016 earthquake sequence, we identified 6 exposure event horizons, respectively at 0.0\u00a0m, 0.7\u00a0m, 0.9\u00a0m, 1.2\u00a0m, 1.6\u00a0m, and 1.8\u00a0m profile height (relative to the 08\/2016 event horizon height). Assuming that these event horizons represent individual earthquakes, the corresponding slip increments range from 0.2\u00a0m to 1.2\u00a0m (Table 1). That said, we want to note that a direct correlation between exposure events, as identified from distinct changes in roughness metric, and individual earthquakes is likely not permissible. Multiple surface rupturing earthquakes may contribute to a single exposure event if these earthquakes occurred shortly after one another, in which case it is better to attribute event horizons to phases of substantial fault activity (potentially encompassing multiple surface ruptures). We will address this point in more detail in the following section.\nWhile positioned along another fault, our findings for the Roccapreturo site are broadly consistent with our findings for Mt. Vettore site (Fig. 6): Fault roughness and its variability increases with profile height, exhibiting profile portions of similar roughness that are separated by sharp, step-like roughness changes. For the Roccapreturo site, we find 3 well developed histogram peaks (i.e., event horizons) at 4.2\u00a0m, 5.9\u00a0m, and 7.0\u00a0m as well as 1 weakly developed peak at 6.3\u00a0m. The latter peak is more apparent in the roughness profiles from which the histograms are derived \u2013the corresponding profile section being bracketed by sharp changes in roughness metric (Fig. 6). Overall, the identified histogram peaks are separated by distinct valleys in the roughness histogram, indicative of sharp, step-like changes in roughness metric when moving from one histogram peak to the next (i.e., moving from one exposure event to the next). Hence, we identified 4 exposure events for the Roccapreturo site with slip increments ranging from 0.4\u00a0m to 1.7\u00a0m (Table 2\n).\nConveniently, the Roccapreturo site was also the location of a CRN investigation that aimed to determine the exposure history of this fault scarp. This investigation identified event horizons at ~4.4\u00a0m and\u00a0~\u00a07.1\u00a0m, with corresponding ages of 2.9 kyrs and 4.5 kyrs (Schlagenhauf, 2009). Our roughness analysis is therefore able to recover these events (EQ1 and EQ4; Table 1; Fig. 6) and presumably able to resolve additional events that were not found in the CRN analysis (at 5.9\u00a0m and 6.3\u00a0m profile height), highlighting the added value that may come from the roughness analysis. Apparently, the fault surface roughened more quickly than cosmogenic radionuclides accumulated, therefore enabling to resolve smaller variations thereof. Because our methodology cannot constrain the timing of the identified paleoearthquakes, we are not able to directly compare (and calibrate) our findings with the paleoseismic study by Falcucci et al. (2015) or the CRN study by Goodall et al. (2021) that were also conducted along the Roccapreturo fault.\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nOur investigation along the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo bedrock fault scarps indicates that fault surface roughness may change systematically along profile height, alternating between a) profile sections with similar roughness characteristics and b) approximately step-like changes in roughness over short profile sections. We suggest that these step-like roughness changes constitute event horizons, separating profile sections that were exposed to subaerial weathering processes for different time periods. In our analysis, we were able to identify 6 event horizons for the Mt. Vettore site and 4 event horizons for the Roccapreturo site, respectively spanning a total profile height of 3.2\u00a0m and 2.8\u00a0m (for the Mt. Vettore site, this includes the 2016 earthquakes). Intuitively, we may assume a direct correlation between these event horizons and individual earthquakes. However, this correlation may not be sensible. For example, for the Mt. Vettore site, we know that the ~1.4\u00a0m offset from 2016 (EQ1 in Table 1; Fig. 2A) contains the slip contribution of two successive events (August 2016 earthquake with ~0.2\u00a0m and October 2016 earthquake with ~1.2\u00a0m of slip at the site; Perouse et al., 2018). The slip amount of the August 2016 earthquake and importantly the time interval between these two earthquakes (~3\u00a0month) is small, prohibiting to distinguish these events through surface roughness analysis. Hence, the reported histogram peaks and event horizons should not be correlated to individual earthquakes but rather to phases of substantial fault activity, potentially spanning more than one surface-rupturing earthquake. The reported offset increments (Tables 1 and 2) therefore represent the total slip amount of these phases, potentially containing slip contributions from more than one earthquake (e.g., Grant-Ludwig et al., 2010) as is also inferred for the record obtained from the 36Cl exposure dating (Beck et al., 2018; Tesson and Benedetti, 2019).\nThis understanding raises the question how many earthquakes contributed to each offset identified increment (i.e., activity phase) and how variable their respective offsets may be. Unfortunately, we are not able to answer this question because we are lacking the necessary observational data (e.g., knowing the event horizon ages to correlated them with paleoseismic studies; e.g., Galli et al., 2019). That said, earthquake physics, rupture simulations, and observational constraints suggest that slip accumulation along faults is dominated by large, full-rupture earthquakes (e.g., Schwartz and Coppersmith, 1984; Youngs and Coppersmith, 1985; Pacheco et al., 1992; Sieh, 1996; Manighetti et al., 2005; Zielke and Arrowsmith, 2008; Ak\u00e7iz et al., 2010; Schlagenhauf et al., 2011; Zielke et al., 2015). Hence, we can provide a lower-bound estimate for the number of earthquakes that contributed to fault scarp formation (i.e., the portions we analyzed here) while further assuming that other (non-tectonic) mechanisms that may expose a fault surface can be neglected (e.g., Giaccio et al., 2002; Wiatr et al., 2015; Mechernich et al., 2018). That is, the 3.2-m high scarp at the Mt. Vettore site was formed by at least 6 surface-rupturing earthquakes, with maximum offsets ranging from 0.2\u00a0m to 1.2\u00a0m. If these offsets are indeed due to the occurrence of a single earthquake, then the corresponding magnitudes would range from M6.1 to M6.7 (Manighetti et al., 2007; Thingbaijam et al., 2017) \u2013plausible values in comparison to the 2016 earthquake sequence. Likewise, if the offset increments at the Roccapreturo site (ranging from 0.4 to 1.7\u00a0m) are caused by the occurrence of single, full-rupture earthquakes, then the corresponding magnitudes would range from M6.3 to M6.8. Note that these magnitude estimates for the Mt. Vettore and Roccpreturo faults are consistent with rupture length to average slip scaling relationships, implying corresponding rupture lengths of 20 to 30\u00a0km \u2013comparable to the reported length of these faults systems (Manighetti et al., 2007; Thingbaijam et al., 2017).\nFurther, we might correlate the 6 event horizons that we identified for the Mt. Vettore scarp (spanning 3.2\u00a0m of fault scarp) with the 6 surface-rupturing earthquakes that occurred within the last 9 kyrs along the Mt. Vettore fault (Galli et al., 2019), implying a throw-rate of ~0.3\u00a0mm\/yr. This rate is consistent with the minimum rate of 0.26\u20130.38\u00a0mm\/yr as derived from a single splay fault of a wide zone of deformation (Galli et al., 2019; Cinti et al., 2019; Pucci et al., 2021). However, it is distinctly lower than the fault's long-term (upper Pleistocene) rate of 0.7\u20131.6\u00a0mm\/yr (Pizzi et al., 2002; Puliti et al., 2020), indicating that either a) the throw-rate slowed down over time, or b) the 3.2-m high scarp was not exhumed over the last 9 kyrs.\nThe Roccapreturo site gives us the opportunity to validate our analysis by comparing it to a previous CRN investigation along this scarp (Schlagenhauf, 2009). We were able to reproduce these earlier findings and further to identify additional surface-rupturing events, implying that fault roughness measurements, under the right conditions, may provide a higher resolution of bedrock scarp exposure events. It appears that fault roughness may change more quickly than CRN is accumulated on scarps, enabling the identification of additional exposure events. However, as noted before, one important missing aspect is determining the age of the identified exposure events. Incorporating CRN analysis along fault scarps to determine the exposure ages directly above the identified event horizons would improve our understanding, as was possible for the Roccapreturo site. Defining these ages directly from roughness measurements requires a) quantifying the relative importance of all physical and chemical weathering processes that are responsible for roughness modification, and b) determining their respective rates, along with the parameters that control them. While this endeavor is beyond the scope of the present study, we anticipate extending in this direction.\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn the present study, we analyze high-resolution surface models of exposed fault surfaces from two sites along two faults in central Italy to determine how fault roughness varies as function of profile height and if it can be used to resolve slip increments of successive earthquakes. In doing so, we can identify 6 and 4 event horizons, respectively, over a total height of 3.2\u00a0m and 2.8\u00a0m for the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo site. Assuming that the corresponding slip increments, ranging from 0.2 to 1.7\u00a0m, were caused by individual, consecutive, surface-rupturing earthquakes, suggests the repeated occurrence of M6.1\u2013M6.8 earthquakes on these faults.\nOur findings indicate that, under specific conditions, fault roughness measurements along exposed fault surface provide the means to identify event horizons of fault exposure, indicating distinct phases of fault activity. We suggest that a combination of surface roughness analysis, as we performed it here (to identify event horizons), and CRN analysis (to assign an age to these event horizons) may further improve our ability to resolve details of the earthquake cycle along bedrock fault scarps.\n\n\nData availability\nThe point cloud data for the Mt.

These phases are frictionally weak at subseismic slip rates compared to most types of minerals (Byerlee, 1978) and highly anisotropic in strength because of their layered mineral structures (Kronenberg et al., 1990; Mares and Kronenberg, 1993). The presence of weak, interconnected phyllosilicates is therefore proposed to be a major control on fault strength and strain localization, as well as slip behavior (e.g. Wintsch et al., 1995; Faulkner et al., 2003\n;\nJefferies et al., 2006\n;\nMoore and Rymer, 2007\n;\nCollettini et al., 2009). As such, understanding the rheological properties of phyllosilicates within fault zones, particularly at in situ pressures, temperatures, and rates of deformation, is important for modeling observed slip modes and improving seismic hazard assessment.\nExperimental measurements of the frictional constitutive properties of phyllosilicates at typical laboratory deformation rates (~0.1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) show that they typically strengthen with increasing velocity or strain rate, implying that weak faults dominated by phyllosilicates may accommodate aseismic slip (e.g., Scruggs and Tullis, 1998\n;\nSaffer and Marone, 2003\n;\nIkari et al., 2009). However, recent deformation experiments have shown that some phyllosilicate-rich fault samples exhibit rate-weakening behavior when sheared at low velocities characteristic of slow slip events (few to few tens of cm\/yr) (Ikari and Kopf, 2017\n;\nRabinowitz et al., 2018), challenging the conceptual framework that frictionally weak faults are stable. It is unclear, however, what microphysical processes cause this change in slip behavior at low deformation rates, and whether these mechanisms rely solely on the presence of specific phyllosilicates or additional minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar) within phyllosilicate-rich gouges (Niemeijer and Spiers, 2007\n;\nden Hartog and Spiers, 2013\n). Although the frictional properties of a wide variety of sheet silicates have been studied at hypocentral temperature and pressure conditions (e.g., Takahashi et al., 2011; Van Diggelen et al., 2010; Lu and He, 2014\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nTesei et al., 2018; Okamoto et al., 2019), fewer monomineralic phyllosilicate samples have been studied at the low shearing velocities representative of slowly creeping faults (e.g., Reinen et al., 1992\n;\nMoore et al., 1997\n;\nScruggs and Tullis, 1998).\nAn important mineral that remains to be studied at slow in situ rates of deformation is chlorite. Previous studies indicate that chlorite may be a dominant control on fault deformation in many tectonic settings, including basalt-hosted segments of subduction megathrusts, oceanic detachment faults, retrograde faults exhuming mafic rocks, and the deep San Andreas Fault (MacLeod et al., 2002\n;\nSchleicher et al., 2012\n;\nFagereng and Ikari, 2020\n;\nBraden and Behr, 2021). However, interpretations of its effect on fault zone rheology have been based on previous friction experiments performed using slip rates >0.3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (Ikari et al., 2009; Okamoto et al., 2019), which show that chlorite has velocity-strengthening friction. As these frictional constitutive properties are largely empirical, it is difficult to reliably extrapolate them to lower rates of deformation.\nHere, we report results from triaxial shear experiments on chlorite gouge under hydrothermal conditions and slip rates from 0.001 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, spanning slow slip rates and the faster velocities previously used to study chlorite deformation. Experiments were conducted at constant confining pressure of 130\u00a0MPa, pore fluid pressures from 10 to 120\u00a0MPa, and temperatures from ~25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C. We determine how the strength, constitutive frictional properties, and microstructure of chlorite vary as a function of velocity, temperature, and effective pressure, finding new evidence that chlorite transitions to rate-neutral and -weakening behavior at low deformation rates. We then use our mechanical and microstructural results to interpret microphysical processes operating within water-saturated chlorite gouge which control transitions in its frictional behavior.\n\n\n2\nMethods\n\n2.1\nSample description\nWe measured the frictional strength of a fine-grained, chlorite schist that originated from the Michigamme Mine in Michigan, USA and was obtained from Ward's Natural Science. Experiments were conducted on disaggregated schist that was hand-ground with a mortar and pestle and sieved to particles <63\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. A hand magnet was used to remove most of the iron oxide minerals from the starting material.\nThe chemical composition of the sample was measured using a field emission electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) to collect quantitative wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and qualitative electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) data. Data were collected at an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV and a working distance of 11\u00a0mm using a JEOL JXA 8530F Hyperprobe at Rice University. The WDS data were collected from 21 point measurements of chlorite grains at an accelerating voltage of 15.0\u00a0kV and current of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 A (Table S1). EDS measurements were used to identify the oxide phases.\nThe EPMA measurements of chlorite grains show that our sample has the chemical formula (Mg1.331Fe2+\n3.282Al1.329Na0.016Ti0.008Ca0.004)(Si2.665Al1.335)O10(OH,O)8 indicating it is close to chamosite, the Fe2+-rich endmember of the chlorite group. Oxide and phosphate phases were identified from EDS measurements as ilmenite and monazite. Quantitative area analysis of the back-scattered electron images of an experimentally deformed sample shows that it consists of >97% chlorite with minor amounts of ilmenite and monazite.\n\n\n2.2\nExperimental setup and procedure\nWe measured the strength and constitutive properties of initially 5\u00a0mm-thick layers of disaggregated chlorite using the triaxial sawcut geometry (Fig. 1\n). Experiments were performed using a servo-controlled triaxial deformation apparatus at Rice University. The apparatus uses a hydraulic pressure system to control confining pressure, pore fluid pressure, and differential load. Confining pressure applies the least compressive stress (\u03c33) with silicon oil and pore fluid pressure (Pf) is applied with deionized water at one end of the sample. Confining and pore fluid pressures are measured with an accuracy of 0.01\u00a0MPa and LVDTs record displacements of the confining and pore pressure intensifier pistons. Differential load is measured with a temperature-compensated cell internal to the pressure vessel and converted to differential stress (\u03c3d) by dividing by cross-sectional area of cylindrical forcing blocks. Displacement of the axial piston is recorded with a linear voltage differential transformer (LVDT) external to the vessel and corrected for the elastic distortion of the apparatus using a calibrated stiffness of 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0N\/m. External heating bands heat the pressure vessel, and temperature is maintained to within 5\u00a0\u00b0C of the setpoint using a thermocouple located within the pressure vessel as feedback.\nSamples were deformed between cylindrical steel forcing blocks 25.4\u00a0mm in diameter with a sawcut surface 35o to the core axis (Fig. 1). The sawcut surfaces have triangular grooves spaced 1\u00a0mm apart to promote shear within the gouge layer, and a porous frit 1-mm thick and 13\u00a0mm in diameter sit in a recess of the sawcut surface to assist with the distribution of pore fluid at the gouge interface. To prepare each sample, we mixed 12.5\u00a0g of chlorite with distilled water to make a thick paste, which we spread in an even layer on one of the blocks using a loading jig and sandwiched carefully with the other block. The sample was then placed between a top and bottom platen and jacketed with three polyolefin sleeves. Once the sample was jacketed and placed in the pressure vessel, confining and pore fluid pressures were increased synchronously to compact the gouge layer yet maintain an effective stress (\u03c33\n\u2019\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c33 \u2013 Pf) less than the target experimental conditions. The experimental setup then equilibrated for 8 to 12\u00a0h while the vessel heated overnight, allowing additional time for compaction and for pore pressure to equilibrate across the gouge layer. We measured a thickness of 3.1\u00a0mm from a sample that was compacted at 70\u00a0MPa effective pressure but not sheared.\nWe conducted shear experiments at a constant confining pressure of 130\u00a0MPa, pore fluid pressures of 10 to 120\u00a0MPa, and temperatures of 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 1\n). All deformation experiments were initiated with a sliding velocity of 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, except for one test (G0176) in which slip was initiated at 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. After samples yielded and began to show linear strain hardening behavior (with one exception), we performed a series of rate steps at sliding velocities between 0.001 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, corresponding to shear strain rates of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0s\u22121, to determine the frictional constitutive properties (Dieterich, 1979). Rate steps were imposed every 0.5\u00a0mm of slip except during the slowest shear velocity which we held for 0.2 to 0.3\u00a0mm of slip. Most chlorite layers were continuously sheared up to 7.5\u00a0mm (shear strain of 2.5) which lasted a duration of four days, though in one experiment (G0012) the sample was unloaded after ~4\u00a0mm of slip and then reloaded. We conducted two experiments at 120\u00a0MPa pore pressure (G0019 and G0202) which exhibit different strain hardening trends than the other. In G0019 we imposed rate steps at the same strains as other experiments and in G0202 we imposed rate steps at higher shear displacements (4.8 to 10.3\u00a0mm) than other experiments. All data was recorded at a sampling rate of 0.2 to 1\u00a0Hz for shear velocities of 0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s and at 10\u00a0Hz for velocities of 0.1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s.\nWe used the measured differential stress, confining pressure, and pore fluid pressure to calculate the shear stress, \u03c4, and effective normal stress, \u03c3n\u2019, along the saw cut following standard procedures (e.g., Chester, 1994\n;\nTembe et al., 2010). We corrected our measurements of differential stress for the change in surface area along the saw cut with slip and the strength of our polyolefin jackets (Appendix A). We report the chlorite strength as the friction coefficient, \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c4\/\u03c3n\u2019, assuming zero cohesion consistent with previous studies on gouge friction (e.g., Chester and Higgs, 1992\n;\nMarone, 1998). We calculate the displacement along the sawcut from measurements of sample shortening. Volume change of the sample during shear was calculated by multiplying the displacement of the pore pressure intensifier piston by its cross-sectional area.\n\n\n2.3\nDetermining rate and state parameters\nWe use rate-and-state friction constitutive laws to evaluate the effects of slip rate and history on the frictional strength of chlorite (Dieterich, 1979\n;\nRuina, 1983). The common constitutive law for the friction coefficient (\u03bc) is\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03bc\n\nV\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03bc\no\n\n+\na\nln\n\n\nV\n\nV\no\n\n\n\n+\nb\nln\n\n\n\n\nV\no\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03bc\n\no\n is the steady state friction coefficient at a reference velocity V\n\no\n, D\n\nc\n is the critical slip distance required to renew a population of grain contacts, a and b are empirical material parameters indicating the direct and evolution effect, respectively, V is the sliding velocity, and \u03b8 is a time-dependent state variable that evolves according to either the aging law (Dieterich, 1979):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\nd\u03b8\ndt\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\nV\u03b8\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor the slip law [Ruina, 1983]:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\nd\u03b8\ndt\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nV\u03b8\n\nD\nc\n\n\nln\n\n\n\nV\u03b8\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor steady state slip (d\u03b8\/dt\u00a0=\u00a00), combining and simplifying these equations isolates the rate-dependence of steady-state friction, \u03bc\n\nss\n, coefficient as:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\u03bc\nss\n\n\n\nd\nln\nV\n\n\n=\na\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive (a-b) values indicate rate-strengthening friction, which promotes stable sliding and fault creep. Negative (a-b) values indicate rate-weakening friction, which is required for the nucleation of unstable slip (e.g., Marone, 1998; Scholz, 2019).\nWe evaluated the rate and state frictional parameters, a, b, and D\n\nc\n from our data using an iterative least-squares inversion method (Reinen and Weeks, 1993) and the RSF3000 code developed by Skarbek and Savage (2019). Individual velocity steps were first linearly detrended using 300\u00a0\u03bcm of slip before each rate step, and data from each rate step was independently inverted across the window 300\u00a0\u03bcm before and after each step. The data was fit using one state variable and with both the aging (Dieterich) and slip (Ruina) laws. The two friction laws produce similar results (Table S2), and we plot frictional constitutive parameters in this paper using the aging law for comparison with previous experimental literature. Following suggestions by Skarbek and Savage (2019), we treated the sample stiffness as a fitting parameter.\n\n\n2.4\nTransient pore pressure effects\nOur ability to quantify the friction coefficient requires that the system is drained, meaning that the pore fluid pressure within the chlorite layer is equal to the pore pressure measured externally. At high shear velocities, pore fluids may become undrained if volume changes in the chlorite outpace the rate that fluids can diffuse into or out of the deforming layer. Following previous studies (e.g., Ikari et al., 2009\n;\nFaulkner et al., 2018; Xing et al., 2019) we calculate the time for pore fluid pressure in the gouge to re-equilibrate with the externally measured fluid pressure following a rate step. The characteristic diffusion time is:\n\n\nt\n=\n\n\n\nh\n2\n\n\u03b2\u03b7\n\n\n2\nk\n\n\n\n\nwhere h is the diffusion length (equal to a gouge thickness of 0.003\u00a0m), \u03b2 is the compressibility of the gouge (~10\u221210\u00a0Pa\u22121 following Faulkner et al. (2018)), \u03b7 is the viscosity of the fluid (0.001\u00a0Pa\u00a0s for water), and k is the permeability of the gouge (~10\u221220\u00a0s\u22121 following Morrow et al. (1984), Faulkner and Rutter (2003), Ikari et al. (2009)). Based on these parameters, we calculate that it takes 45\u00a0s for pore fluids to equilibrate after a rate step and conclude that deformation must occur over a significantly larger time scale to be considered drained. If we assume that determination of the steady-state friction coefficient requires fluid diffusion over an increment of 150\u00a0\u03bcm of slip (i.e., one half the displacement following a rate step we use to model frictional behavior), then the maximum slip rate that would allow pore fluid to drain is v\u00a0=\u00a0150\u00a0\u03bcm\/45\u00a0s\u00a0=\u00a03.3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. This indicates that our fastest rate step (10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) is likely undrained. In addition, the parameters a, b, and D\n\nc\n are measured over different time scales, and even slower rate steps could result in undrained conditions over the time scales that these parameters are determined. We measure the individual time intervals over which a, b, and D\n\nc\n are determined from our data to constrain the slip rates for which these parameters are measured under drained conditions.\n\n\n2.5\nMicrostructural analyses\nWe study the microstructures developed in the chlorite using a combination of polarized light and back-scattered electron (BSE) microscopy. A JEOL JXA 8530F Hyperprobe at Rice University was used to collect BSE images, and this is the same instrument used to determine the chemical composition of the sample. Back-scattered electron images were collected at an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV and a working distance of 11\u00a0mm.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nFrictional strength\nThe rheology of chlorite is frictional at the experimental conditions as shown by the strong dependence of its shear strength on effective pressure and weak dependence on deformation rate (Fig. 2a). Most of the samples exhibit non-linear strain hardening curves during the initial 2\u00a0mm of displacement and gradual near-linear strain hardening for the remainder of shear deformation. The exceptions are the two samples sheared at the lowest effective pressure (10\u00a0MPa; G0019 and G0202), which initially strengthen with increasing strain but then strain-weaken to a residual strength. Across all samples, friction coefficients range between 0.29 and 0.53 at 2\u00a0mm of shear displacement and 0.40 and 0.53 at 6\u00a0mm of displacement (Fig. 2b and c). At 6\u00a0mm displacement and 130\u00a0\u00b0C, the friction coefficient is similar (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.44 and 0.46) for samples sheared at effective pressures of 120 and 70\u00a0MPa corresponding to 10\u00a0MPa and 60\u00a0MPa pore fluid pressure, respectively, but is higher (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.5) at the lowest effective pressure of 10\u00a0MPa corresponding to 120\u00a0MPa pore pressure. At constant effective pressure of 120\u00a0MPa, the frictional strength of the chlorite increases with increasing temperature from \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.40 at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) to \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.46 at 130\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3\n).\n\n\n3.2\nVolume change\nThe chlorite samples compact during shear until 3 to 4\u00a0mm of displacement, after which they deform at a relatively constant pore volume (Appendix B). Comparison of pore volume change as a function of displacement and time over the course of multiple rate steps shows that compaction is controlled by displacement and not deformation rate (Fig. B.1). As a result, at displacements <3 to 4\u00a0mm, there is an increased rate of compaction with time as velocity increases. We are only able to document these effects at velocities of 1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. At lower velocities changing environmental factors in the laboratory (e.g., the room temperature) have a more pronounced effect on the pore pressure intensifier piston LVDT, which masks measurements of the small volume changes in the sample.\n\n\n3.3\nVelocity dependence of the frictional strength\nChlorite deformed at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) shows a clear transition from rate-weakening (a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.004) at slow velocities (0.001\u20130.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) to rate-strengthening (a-b\u00a0=\u00a00.005) at fast velocities (1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) (Fig. 4a). In contrast, at 70 and 130\u00a0\u00b0C and the same effective pressure (120\u00a0MPa) the frictional strength is near rate-neutral across the range of slip velocities tested (Fig. 4a and b), although at 130\u00a0\u00b0C the chlorite shows a trend consistent with a transition from slightly rate-weakening (a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.001) to slightly rate-strengthening (a-b\u00a0=\u00a00.001) over a 4 orders of magnitude increase in velocity (Fig. 4a).\nAt 130\u00a0\u00b0C, the rate-dependence of the frictional strength is similar at 120\u00a0MPa and 70\u00a0MPa effective pressure, exhibiting a transition from slightly rate-weakening to slightly rate-strengthening with increasing slip rate (Fig. 4c). In contrast, at 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure (Pf\u00a0=\u00a0120\u00a0MPa), the frictional behavior of chlorite shows much greater variability with respect to slip rate, shear displacement, and step direction which makes identifying clear trends challenging. Overall, at velocities <1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s the chlorite rate-strengthens significantly (a-b\u00a0=\u00a00.008 to 0.016) when rate steps were imposed beyond ~5.5\u00a0mm of slip (G0202), but has rate-neutral strength when imposed at lower displacements (G0019). In addition, at 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure chlorite generally rate-weakens between 1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, as shown most prominently when the velocity is stepped down from 10 to 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.009 to \u22120.015). We infer though that the rate-weakening behavior at high velocities may result from transient fluid overpressure in the sample, based on our estimate that slip rates >3.3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s result in undrained conditions and observations of compaction during those fast slip rates (Appendix B).\nThe parameters a and b vary with temperature and deformation rate (Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). At room temperature, a increases with velocity, while at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 130\u00a0\u00b0C a trend is not as clear (Fig. 5a b). In addition, a increases with increasing temperature at slow velocities (0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) yet shows the reverse trend at faster velocities (0.10 to 10.0\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) (Fig. 6a and b). These trends indicate that the processes controlling the direct effect in chlorite are temperature- and time-sensitive. The parameter b shows more consistent behavior; across all velocities and in all experiments except at very high pore pressure, b decreases systematically with increasing velocity such that at the fastest velocity (10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) b becomes very low or zero (b\u00a0=\u00a00 to 0.002) (Fig. 5c and d). However, b is generally less sensitive to temperature compared to a, as b only increases between 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 130\u00a0\u00b0C when the velocity is stepped down to 0.01 and 0.001\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (Fig. 6c and d). Values of Dc are more scattered but are greatest at room temperature and increase slightly with increasing velocity at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 130\u00a0\u00b0C (Figs. 5e and f and 6e and f). The parameters a, b, and Dc do not show clear trends with increasing effective pressure during rate steps imposed at similar amounts of slip.\nWe determine the time scales over which a, b, and Dc are measured at different velocities to evaluate whether the reported values reflect deformation under drained conditions. We previously determined that at velocities up to 3.3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s steady-state strength is measured under drained conditions, and we conclude that b and Dc are also measured under drained conditions at these velocities. Specifically, the time interval over which b and D\n\nc\n are measured exceeds 45\u00a0s at velocities between 0.001 and 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, except when the sample is heated and sheared at 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. In contrast, the \u2018instantaneous\u2019 rate dependence (a) is measured over a much shorter time scale; approximately 1% (3\u00a0\u03bcm) of the slip following a rate step controls the inverse model result for a. Accordingly, deformation associated with the measurement of a only exceeds the equilibration time of 45\u00a0s at velocities up to 3\u00a0\u03bcm \/45\u00a0s\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, and rate steps between 0.1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s provide measurements for a under undrained conditions. Our observations of compaction at these rates indicate that these steps may induce transient fluid overpressure, thereby decreasing the value of a (Faulkner et al., 2018). The values of a that we report at these rate steps are thus lower bounds, which we consider in our interpretations of the data.\n\n\n3.4\nMicrostructures\nAll deformed chlorite layers that were examined developed shear bands that define composite planar fabrics (Fig. 7\n). The shear bands are a few tens of microns wide and have R1- and Y-orientations following the terminology of Logan et al. (1979), although R1-shears are generally more common. Within shears grain size reduction has occurred, and both R1- and Y- shears contain strongly aligned grains of chlorite, as indicated by the uniform birefringence colors in cross-polarized light with and without the gypsum wedge inserted. The occurrence and distribution of these shears varies with the effective pressure and temperature of deformation.\nBoundary shears develop near the forcing block contacts at all conditions in the Y-orientation (Fig. 7). Y-shears also occur through the center of chlorite layers deformed at the highest effective stress, spanning nearly the entire length of the samples (G0110 and G0017), but not at the lowest effective stress (G0019). The R1 shears locally anastomose, split, and connect with adjacent R1- and Y-shears. The abundance of R1 shears varies strongly with effective pressure and temperature. Increasing effective pressure results in the formation of a greater abundance of R1 shears, as can be seen by comparing samples deformed at 130\u00a0\u00b0C and either 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure (G0019), which exhibits only a few thin shears spaced throughout the layer, or 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure (G0017), which exhibits a much greater abundance of shear bands (Fig. 7a and b). The abundance of R1 shears also increases with temperature. Among the samples deformed at 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure, a large number of distributed shears developed at 130\u00a0\u00b0C (G0017), whereas at 25\u00a0\u00b0C (G0110) deformation is concentrated more strongly within tabular zones of R1 shears (Fig. 7b\u2013e). The increase in R1 shear abundance with increasing temperature or pressure also correlates with higher shear strength. We also see fewer and more localized shears in chlorite deformed at higher velocities that correspond to rate-strengthening (G0155) behavior compared to lower velocities and rate-weakening (G0176) frictional behavior (Fig. 7d and e).\nAlthough deformation is predominantly accommodated along localized shears, the deformed samples also display more developed foliation with increasing effective pressure (Fig. 8a and b). The foliation is defined by elongated grains of chlorite and magnetite, which are inclined in the P-orientation 20-30o from the saw-cut angle in samples sheared at 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure. Individual grains of chlorite exhibit bending, kinking, and undulose extinction, which are crystal plastic deformation mechanisms (Fig. 8b and c). However, chlorite grains within the original undeformed schist also display these microstructures, so it is difficult to assess from our thin sections whether crystal plastic mechanisms operated during our deformation experiments.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nFrictional strength\nWe document the frictional strength of Fe-rich chlorite gouge with shear displacement (shear strain), effective pressure, temperature, and sliding velocity. Shear displacement has a large influence on strength as most samples show significant strain hardening behavior (Fig. 2; Table 1). This behavior may occur because we use a relatively thick gouge layer (~3\u00a0mm after compaction), which could require high shear displacements to reach a shear strain required for steady-state frictional sliding. Shear experiments on initially 1\u00a0mm thick phyllosilicate gouge layers, by comparison, typically do not show as extensive strain hardening (e.g., Morrow et al., 2000\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2011). The strain hardening trends we observe during experiments at 70 and 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure may reflect continuous grain crushing during shear consistent with results from Haines et al. (2013) who showed similar strain hardening trends that correlated with evidence of significant grain size reduction in crushed chlorite schist, but steady-state frictional sliding in finer natural gouge chlorite (<2\u00a0\u03bcm) with minimal change in particle size distribution with increasing shear strain.\nEven with strain hardening, the range of friction coefficients that we report at room temperature and 70\u2013120\u00a0MPa effective pressure is generally comparable to the steady-state friction coefficients of 0.2 to 0.4 reported for saturated chlorite-rich gouges at room teimperature (Fagereng and Ikari, 2020; Behnsen and Faulkner, 2012\n;\nIkari et al., 2009\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2004\n;\nMorrow et al., 2000). Furthermore, our observation of a greater steady-state friction coefficient (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.52) at 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure is consistent with studies showing higher friction coefficients at very low effective normal stress in clays and other sheet silicates due to non-negligible cohesion (e.g., Behnsen and Faulkner, 2012). Differences in the friction coefficients reported from different studies on chlorite may result from several factors including the presence of additional phases within samples, grain size distribution and geometry, different experimental conditions, the use of simulated gouge versus natural cataclasite or single crystal sheets (Smith et al., 2017\n;\nOkamoto et al., 2019), and the chemical composition of chlorite (Moore and Lockner, 2015). Our measured friction coefficients for Fe-rich chlorite (chamosite) are slightly higher than the steady-state value of 0.38 measured for ripidolite, which has an intermediate Mg\/Fe ratio, at room temperature (Moore and Lockner, 2004). Clinochlore, which is the Mg-rich endmember of chlorite and forms a solid solution series with chamosite, has an even lower steady-state friction coefficient of 0.25 at room temperature (Okamoto et al., 2019). Our sample of chamosite contains 35\u00a0wt% FeO, compared to 5 wt% FeO in the clinochlore used by Okamoto et al. (2019). Our results therefore support the observation that increasing Fe content in chlorite promotes a slight increase in its frictional strength (Moore and Lockner, 2015). Additionally, the frictional strength of our chlorite gouge sample is greater than that of intact chlorite-rich cataclasite (Smith et al., 2017) and significantly higher than sheared stacks of single chlorite sheets (Okamoto et al., 2019). This is in agreement with previous studies that have demonstrated that samples with well-developed foliation or artificially aligned phyllosilicate sheets can be significantly weaker than powdered samples (e.g., Collettini et al., 2009\n;\nCarpenter et al., 2012\n;\nTesei et al., 2012\n;\nKawai et al., 2015\n;\nOkamoto et al., 2019). Thus, the friction coefficients that we report on simulated chlorite gouge likely provide an upper bound for strongly aligned, interconnected networks of chlorite within natural faults.\nThe increase in chlorite frictional strength with temperature that we document has also been documented in illite and lizardite (Moore et al., 1997\n;\nden Hartog et al., 2012\n;\nKubo and Katayama, 2015), though lizardite has been shown to exhibit temperature-neutral friction as well (Tesei et al., 2018). In contrast, other sheet silicate-rich fault rocks including talc and smectite weaken with increasing temperature (Moore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nCoble et al., 2014). Some previous studies on phyllosilicate-rich fault gouges have attributed the strengthening effect of temperature to the thinning of water films adsorbed to mineral surfaces (e.g., Kubo and Katayama, 2015\n;\nOkamoto et al., 2019) which can act as a lubricant during shear in water-saturated and room dry experiments (e.g., Moore and Lockner, 2004\n;\nBehnsen and Faulkner, 2012\n;\nS\u00e1nchez-Roa et al., 2017\n;\nBeynon and Faulkner, 2020). In accordance with site adsorption theory (Masel, 1996), an increase in temperature is expected to reduce the thickness of adsorbed water films and therefore increase the shear resistance between mineral surfaces (Israelachvili et al., 1988). In other cases, temperature-strengthening frictional behavior has been attributed to thermally activated mechanisms of the minerals, such as subcritical crack growth (Chester, 1994). However, when controlled by mineral deformation, strengthening is usually very small, on the order of the rate-dependence of strength, and best measured using temperature-stepping experiments (Chester, 1995). We measure a relatively strong effect of temperature (Fig. 3), and as a result we infer the temperature dependence of strength that we measure is likely controlled by the strength of water films.\nIn our study, higher temperature correlates with a clear increase in the number and density of shears that develop (Fig. 7), which also correlates with a corresponding increase in shear strength (Figs. 2a). Additionally, higher Riedel abundance and shear strength correlate with increasing effective pressure. We interpret that the greater abundance of shears at elevated temperature and pressure reflects the decrease in water film thickness (i.e., number of water monolayers) between aligned sheets of chlorite. If structured water films are initially thinner due to elevated temperature or pressure, then less slip is required to subsequently thin or squeeze them out between aligned plate surfaces. This would cause individual shears to strengthen more readily with slip, and in turn, distribute deformation to weaker layers in the gouge where more shear surfaces would develop. An increase in Riedel shear abundance with increasing temperature and strength has also been reported in illite-rich gouge when sheared from room temperature to 200\u00a0\u00b0C (Kubo and Katayama, 2015). However, from 200 to 600\u00a0\u00b0C, the distribution of Riedel shears in illite generally remains constant with increasing temperature (Moore et al., 1989). Thus, the correlation we observe in our study between increasing temperature and Riedel shear abundance may only extend to low temperature ranges (<200\u00a0\u00b0C) in some phyllosilicates.\n\n\n4.2\nRate and state dependence of strength\nThe rate dependence of chlorite frictional strength (a-b) exhibits complex correlations with slip rate and temperature at the experimental conditions (Fig. 4a). The chlorite gouge rate-strengthens when sheared at fast slip rates (1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), except during the tests at the lowest effective pressure (G0019 and G0202), during which it was likely that compaction produced fluid overpressure at fast velocity steps leading to apparent rate-weakening (Faulkner et al., 2018). This is consistent with earlier studies that have documented rate-strengthening behavior of chlorite over a similar range of velocities (Ikari et al., 2009; Haines et al., 2013\n;\nOkamoto et al., 2019\n;\nFagereng and Ikari, 2020). However, at the lower sliding velocities (0.001\u20130.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) used in our study, chlorite exhibits predominantly rate-neutral or rate-weakening behavior, except when sheared under very high pore fluid pressure. The transition from negative to positive values of (a-b) with increasing velocity is sometimes referred to as the cutoff velocity (e.g., Shibazaki and Iio, 2003), and it occurs at ~1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s and is most dramatic at room temperature. The cutoff velocity of chlorite reflects different dependencies of the direct and evolution effects on velocity and temperature.\nThe contact-scale model of frictional deformation proposed by Chester (1994) predicts that rate-weakening friction occurs at the same conditions as temperature-strengthening friction and vice versa if the direct and evolution effects are governed by the same micromechanical process. This correlation between temperature and velocity-dependent frictional strength has been observed in studies on quartzofeldspathic and phyllosilicate-rich gouges (e.g., Chester, 1994; Blanpied et al., 1998; Moore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nden Hartog et al., 2012\n;\nCoble et al., 2014). However, in contrast to this model our results demonstrate that (1) chlorite rate-strengthens at the same velocities (1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) at which its frictional strength increases with temperature and (2) the direct and evolution effects show different dependencies on slip rate and temperature. This implies that different contact-scale processes may be controlling the direct and evolution effects of friction at the conditions of our study.\nPrevious experimental data on phyllosilicates at low deformation rates show a correlation between the temperature dependent frictional strength and rate-dependence that is consistent with the Chester (1994) model. At room temperature and very low sliding velocities (~0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), water-saturated chrysotile, talc, and smectite gouges all show rate-strengthening behavior and weaken with increasing temperature between 25 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C (Moore et al., 1997\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nCoble et al., 2014). Thus, the frictional strength and rate-dependence of these phyllosilicates are thought to depend on mineral deformation at sliding velocities below 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. Antigorite, biotite, and muscovite similarly rate-strengthen at these low velocities (Reinen et al., 1992\n;\nScruggs and Tullis, 1998). However, their frictional strength is insensitive to temperature between 25 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C (Takahashi et al., 2011\n;\nLu and He, 2014\n;\nVan Diggelen et al., 2010), which suggests the Chester (1994) model may not describe the dominant physical properties of some phyllosilicates.\nIn contrast to the phyllosilicates discussed above, some lizardite and illite gouges have been reported to strengthen with increasing temperature above 25\u00a0\u00b0C (Moore et al., 1997\n;\nKubo and Katayama, 2015), yet the rate-dependencies of these minerals at low velocities are not well constrained. Moore et al. (1997) reported rate-weakening behavior of lizardite at velocities between ~0.03 and 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s but acknowledged a general lack of repeatability in their data. However, despite this gap in experimental data, previous studies indicate that illite-rich gouges are also rate-neutral or rate-weakening at low velocities, even at low temperatures (den Hartog et al., 2012\n;\nIkari and Kopf, 2017\n;\nRabinowitz et al., 2018). For example, den Hartog et al. (2012) showed that illite gouge transitions from rate-strengthening to rate-weakening at temperatures between 200 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C for sliding velocities between 1 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. They observed that the a-b values of illite systematically decrease with decreasing velocity, and thus proposed that extrapolating their a-b data to lower velocities would shift the rate-weakening behavior of illite to lower temperatures, consistent with our results on chlorite. Additionally, Rabinowitz et al. (2018) documented the effects of velocity and temperature on the frictional properties of carbonate- and clay-bearing sediment subducting at the Hikurangi Trench. They reported that its strength increases from 20 to 100\u00a0\u00b0C and found that the sediment transitioned to rate-weakening behavior at plate-rate velocities. Although clay minerals made up only ~20% of their sample, they interpreted that the clay fraction predominantly controlled the frictional strength and behavior. Thus, it is possible that the processes controlling the temperature and rate dependencies of strength in our chlorite sample are similar in other phyllosilicates such as illite.\n\n4.2.1\nMicromechanical controls on the direct effect\nAt low sliding velocities (0.001\u20130.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), the increase in a with increasing temperature is consistent with previous studies on several minerals including olivine, plagioclase, antigorite, biotite, and smectite that show a linear increase in a with increasing temperature (Fig. 6b) (King and Marone, 2012\n;\nHe et al., 2013\n;\nTakahashi et al., 2011\n;\nLu and He, 2014\n;\nFrench et al., 2015). This behavior is commonly interpreted to reflect a thermally activated deformation mechanism that controls deformation at grain contacts (Chester, 1995\n;\nRice et al., 2001\n;\nNakatani, 2001\n;\nBeeler et al., 2007), such as dislocation glide in phyllosilicates (Beeler et al., 2007\n;\nLu and He, 2014\n;\nFrench et al., 2015). Tullis and Weeks (1987) and Beeler et al. (2007) developed a normalization scheme that relates the magnitude of a to the rate-dependence of the contact scale deformation mechanism given by a\n0\/\u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a0Ac0\/\u03c40, where the subscript 0 refers to reference temperature and strain-rate conditions, a\n0 is the frictional rate dependence, \u03bc0 is the reference friction coefficient, A\nc0 is the rate-dependence of the contact scale deformation mechanism, and \u03c40 is the contact scale shear stress.\nWe evaluate whether our data for chlorite are consistent with previous analyses for phyllosilicates. For our chlorite sample, we approximate a\n0\u00a0=\u00a00.0045 and \u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a00.42 at 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 with a resulting ratio of a\n0\/\u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a00.011. Although dislocation glide data for chlorite are not available, the normalized rate dependence for illite, biotite, and muscovite range between 0.014 and 0.018 when scaled to 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 (French et al., 2015). This is larger than the normalized rate-dependence of chlorite friction. For comparison, a\n0\/\u03bc0 of smectite gouge at velocities <10\u22125\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (shear strain rates less than ~5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0s\u22121) is 0.017\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 and inferred to reflect dislocation glide; however, at velocities >10\u22125\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, a\n0\/\u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a00.009\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003 and is inferred to reflect subcritical delamination and fracture (French et al., 2015). By comparison, we infer that the similar normalized rate dependence over a similar range of velocities (> 10\u22125\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) is most consistent with the occurrence of the same mechanism, subcritical fracture and delamination, in chlorite as well, although this comparison does not rule out the operation of additional deformation mechanisms.\nMicrostructural evidence of grain size reduction is consistent with our inference that the instantaneous rate dependence (a) is controlled by subcritical fracture. Evidence of crystal plastic deformation of individual chlorite grains, including undulatory extinction, kinking, and twinning (Fig. 8), may have only been inherited from the original chlorite schist and may not have occurred during frictional shear. However, crystal plasticity could control the rate-dependence at lower velocities and higher temperatures as has been inferred in other phyllosilicates (e.g., Reinen et al., 1992\n;\nScruggs and Tullis, 1998\n;\nBeeler et al., 2007\n;\nFrench et al., 2015).\nAt the faster velocity steps between 0.1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, the decrease in a with increasing temperature is not consistent with any thermally activated deformation mechanism of the mineral, suggesting that other microphysical processes control the direct effect during these fast slip rates. We note that at similar velocities, the magnitude of a in montmorillonite increases with increasing hydration state while its coefficient of friction decreases (Ikari et al., 2007). For montmorillonite, this corresponds to both the number of water interlayers and the amount of water adsorbed onto crystal surfaces, though much of the water is adsorbed to surfaces of montmorillonite due to its high specific surface area (Newman, 1987; Moore and Lockner, 2007). Thus, although chlorite does not adsorb water molecules in its interlayer space (i.e. is a non-swelling clay), the removal of adsorbed water from chlorite surfaces may similarly decrease the direct effect with increasing temperature.\n\n\n4.2.2\nMicromechanical controls on the evolution effect\nIn contrast to the direct effect, the evolution effect does not demonstrate a clear dependence on temperature but is sensitive to deformation rate. The systematic decrease in the magnitude of b with increasing slip rate is the main driver of rate-weakening behavior at low velocities in our study. The b parameter is thought to reflect the evolution of grain contact area or strength through physical or chemical processes (Dieterich and Conrad, 1984). Studies of saturated clay-rich fault gouges, including illite, montmorillonite, talc, and chlorite, report negligible or negative b values with a-b\u00a0>\u00a00, indicating that the real area of mineral contact does not vary significantly with shearing velocity (Moore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nIkari et al., 2009). In experiments above 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure, we only observe near-zero values of b at the fastest velocity steps (Fig. 5c and d), which suggests that time-dependent processes controlling the evolution effect are important at low strain rates. Like our chlorite sample, biotite and muscovite gouges also exhibit b\u00a0>\u00a00 (e.g., den Hartog et al., 2013; Lu and He, 2014).\nSeveral deformation mechanisms have been proposed to explain the rate-weakening behavior of phyllosilicate-bearing fault rocks at either low slip rates or high temperatures. These include: (1) time-dependent removal of adsorbed water films (Scruggs, 1997), (2) time-dependent plastic deformation at grain-scale asperity contacts, which increase growth in real areas of contact (Dieterich, 1981\n;\nIkari and Kopf, 2017), (3) thermally-activated deformation of clasts (e.g., quartz and calcite) by pressure solution or stress corrosion cracking, with athermal granular flow of the gouge layer accompanied by dilation (Niemeijer and Spiers, 2007\n;\nden Hartog and Spiers, 2013\n;\nVerberne et al., 2020), (4) transient increases in pore fluid pressure due to increased compaction rates at higher velocities (e.g., Faulkner et al., 2018), and (5) shear-induced dehydration of phyllosilicate minerals in the gouge layer (e.g., Takahashi et al., 2011\n;\nOkazaki and Katayama, 2015\n;\nLecl\u00e8re et al., 2016). We conclude that velocity dependent water film thickness is most consistent with our data. Specifically, growth in the real area of asperity contacts due to plastic deformation should result in temperature-dependent values of b (e.g., Lu and He, 2014). However, this is not shown in our data, though we acknowledge that small temperature effects on b may be masked by the influence of strain-hardening. Furthermore, our sample contains >97% chlorite and we observe no microstructural evidence of pressure solution (Fig. 7). Transient increases in pore fluid pressure are also unlikely to influence the frictional behavior of our sample at low slip rates (<1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) where the highest values of b are measured. Finally, our experiments were conducted well below the thermal stability limit of chlorite (~650\u00a0\u00b0C), and we observe no evidence for the formation of dehydration products in our deformed samples.\nWe propose that the magnitude of b and its velocity dependence are controlled by the time-dependent removal of adsorbed water films from mineral surfaces (e.g., Scruggs, 1997). Likewise, Okamoto et al. (2019) suggested that the increase in steady state frictional strength of chlorite with temperature may result from the effect of adsorbed water films, which is also consistent with our observations. Adsorbed water coats grain surfaces and decreases the strength and\/or real area of their contacts. We propose that at lower sliding velocities, the average grain contact lifetime is longer, allowing for more time for water layers to squeeze out and cause strengthening. Thinner water layers at grain contacts may lead to higher strength for two reasons. First, the shear strength of structured water layers between grains increases with decreasing layer thickness (Israelachvili et al., 1988). In addition, thinner water layers may also result in a larger real area of contact between rough grain surfaces, thereby increasing frictional resistance at low sliding rates. As such, we infer that either or both these processes may control the negative rate dependence of b (Fig. 5) and overall rate-weakening behavior of chlorite at 70\u00a0MPa and 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure. However, conditions of high pore fluid pressure or low effective pressure may allow adsorbed water films to maintain their thickness (e.g., Van Diggelen et al., 2010\n;\nBehnsen and Faulkner, 2012), which would decrease the evolution effect. Our observation that chlorite exhibits large rate-strengthening and state-insensitive frictional behavior during slower rate steps (0.001 to 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) only at 120\u00a0MPa pore pressure (\u03c33\n\u2019\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0MPa) (Fig. 2c) seems to support this interpretation. Additionally, recent experiments using faster velocity steps (>0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) also showed that increasing pore fluid pressure promotes greater rate-strengthening behavior and near-zero or negative b values in phyllosilicate-rich gouges, even at constant effective pressure (Xing et al., 2019\n;\nBedford et al., 2021). However, we note from our high pore fluid pressure experiments (G0019 and G0202) that increasing shear strain and fabric development also influence the frictional behavior of chlorite. Therefore, further experimental studies are required to fully constrain the effects of fabric evolution and pore fluid pressure on the slip behavior of phyllosilicates at low velocities.\n\n\n\n4.3\nSynthesis\nAt relatively fast slip rates (>0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), our measurements of chlorite constitutive properties, including its temperature-strengthening and velocity-strengthening frictional behavior, are consistent with results from previous experimental studies (Okamoto et al., 2019\n;\nFagereng and Ikari, 2020\n;\nIkari et al., 2009). However, we also observe that chlorite transitions to rate-neutral or -weakening behavior at slip rates below 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. Based on microstructural and micromechanical analyses, we interpret that this transition in rate dependence is controlled by a competition between mineral deformation mechanisms at grain contacts (subcritical fracture and delamination), which increase a, and the time-dependent properties of water films bonded to contacts, which increase b.\nBy comparing the frictional properties of chlorite with other phyllosilicates, we find that at low velocities, the rate dependence and temperature dependence of strength are often inversely correlated. For instance, illite, which strengthens with increasing temperature from room temperature to 200\u00a0\u00b0C (Kubo and Katayama, 2015), is predicted to velocity-weaken at slip rates slower than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (den Hartog et al., 2012\n) similar to our results for chlorite at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Conversely, water-saturated phyllosilicates that show temperature-weakening or -neutral friction (e.g., antigorite, talc, smectite, muscovite, and biotite) all rate-strengthen at low velocities (~0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) (Reinen et al., 1992\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nCoble et al., 2014\n;\nScruggs and Tullis, 1998). We hypothesize that phyllosilicates rate-weaken at low deformation rates when they are temperature-strengthening because both responses are controlled by physical changes of water films bonded to mineral surfaces. Although chlorite and possibly illite seem to be unique in promoting velocity-neutral or -weakening behavior of faults at shallow crustal levels corresponding to <200\u00a0\u00b0C, other phyllosilicates may transition to similar behavior at higher temperatures. For example, water-saturated biotite and muscovite transition to temperature-strengthening behavior above 100 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C, which may promote rate-weakening friction at low deformation rates, as has been documented at even higher velocities and temperatures (Lu and He, 2014\n;\nVan Diggelen et al., 2010). In contrast, both oven-dried and water-saturated talc continue to temperature-weaken and exhibit large rate-strengthening behavior at low deformation rates (0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) from 100 to 300\u00a0\u00b0C, which likely reflects its hydrophobic nature (Moore and Lockner, 2008). Lastly, chlorites tested by Moore and Lockner (2015) were reported to rate-strengthen at similar shearing rates (0.00115 to 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) as our experiments and exhibit no clear temperature dependence of strength from 25 to 300\u00a0\u00b0C, which also supports the hypothesis that phyllosilicates rate-weaken at low velocities when they are temperature-strengthening. However, the discrepancy between chlorite constitutive behavior in our study and that reported by Moore and Lockner (2015) may imply that other factors besides temperature and shearing rate determine whether adsorbed water films affect the slip behavior of chlorite, such as pore fluid pressure or Fe content.\n\n\n4.4\nImplications for natural fault zones\nChlorite is frictionally weak (\u03bc\u00a0~\u00a00.4) under shallow hydrothermal conditions (Fig. 2), and faults containing chlorite may therefore accommodate slip under low shear stresses. This finding is consistent with field observations of chlorite-bearing fault zones in which deformation is localized into contiguous layers of chlorite-rich fault rock (e.g., Lacroix et al., 2012; Phillips et al., 2020; Fagereng and Ikari, 2020). However, the increase in frictional strength of chlorite with increasing temperature indicates that fault zones enriched in chlorite may become stronger with increasing depth. This relationship may extend to depths corresponding to the thermal stability limit of chlorite, as the frictional strength of chlorite is shown to increase with temperature up to 600\u00a0\u00b0C (Okamoto et al., 2019). In addition, we observe that chamosite which is the Fe2+ endmember of chlorite displays higher values of friction than what has been reported for clinochlore, its Mg-rich counterpart (Okamoto et al., 2019). This comparison between the strengths of Fe- and Mg-rich chlorites is consistent with previous trends observed by Moore and Lockner (2015), indicating that faults enriched in Fe-rich chlorite may be stronger than faults filled with Mg-rich chlorite.\nThe constitutive behavior of chlorite has important implications for the stability of chlorite-rich fault zones. Based on previous laboratory measurements, chlorite has been interpreted to exhibit predominantly stable, rate-strengthening behavior across a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions, indicating that it will promote aseismic creep from shallow to deep segments of faults (Ikari et al., 2009; Okamoto et al., 2019\n;\nFagereng and Ikari, 2020). However, while we observe rate-strengthening behavior of chlorite at typical shearing velocities used in friction experiments (>10\u22126\u00a0m\/s), we observe that chlorite exhibits rate-neutral to rate-weakening behavior when sheared at slower natural rates of fault slip (10\u22129 to 10\u22127\u00a0m\/s) (Fig. 4a). This suggests that faults enriched in chlorite may be more easily destabilized than previously thought. Furthermore, this rate-weakening behavior of chlorite occurs within the characteristic slip rates of slow slip events (~10\u22128 to 10\u22127\u00a0m\/s). One of the proposed causes of slow slip is a transition between rate-strengthening and slightly rate-weakening behavior during frictional sliding (Rubin, 2008\n;\nLiu and Rice, 2009\n;\nSegall et al., 2010), and chlorite is a product of metasomatism at shallow and deep slow slip conditions (Phillips et al., 2020; Braden and Behr, 2021). Thus, faults enriched in chlorite may become marginally unstable at slow slip rates but stabilize at a cutoff velocity around 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (as modelled by Kato (2003), Shibazaki and Iio (2003), and Liu and Rice (2009)). Although our study focuses on chlorite deformation at shallow depths within fault zones, chlorite may also play a significant role on slow slip within the deep tremor source of subduction zones, wherein chlorite is present and chlorite and lawsonite are predicted to dehydrate and generate high pore fluid pressures (French and Condit, 2019\n;\nCondit et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nChlorite is an important product of hydrothermal alteration within fault zones, including transform and subduction plate boundaries. However, it is poorly studied compared to other phyllosilicate minerals, particularly under elevated temperatures and at low sliding velocities. We present the results of triaxial shear experiments conducted at constant confining pressure of 130\u00a0MPa, pore fluid pressures from 10 to 120\u00a0MPa, and temperatures from 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C. We show that chlorite has a frictional strength that increases by \u0394\u03bc\u00a0~\u00a00.06 as temperature increases from 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C. At velocities less than 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s the chlorite is rate-weakening and it transitions to rate-strengthening at higher velocities. Overall, the magnitude of the rate-dependence is greatest at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. These results indicate that seismic and slow slip may nucleate in chlorite-rich fault zones. We attribute the magnitude of the instantaneous rate dependence (a) to rate-strengthening mineral deformation and the magnitudes of the evolution effect (b) and the overall rate-dependence of the frictional strength (a-b) to the strength of water films between grains.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\nSupplementary Table S1\n\nPoint Measurements of Chlorite Grain Compositions a\n\n\nSupplementary Table S1\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary Table S2\n\nAging law and slip law fits for velocity steps during friction experiments\n\nSupplementary Table S2\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tecto.2022.229435.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nBenjamin D.

The Xianshuihe Fault Zone (XSHF) is one of the most active strike-slip faults on the eastern Tibetan Plateau (Li et al., 1997). As the boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan block and Bayan Har block, the XSHF is the channel for the movement of matter and absorbs most of the crustal extrusion deformation (Li et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2015). Along the NW-striking, left-lateral XSHF, as many as 8\u00a0M\u00a0>\u00a07 and 29\u00a0M\u00a0>\u00a06.5 earthquakes have occurred since 1700\u00a0CE (Fig. 1b) (Wen et al., 2008). The Kangding segment is a special part of the XSHF that has four active faults and can exhibit large earthquakes (Ma et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020). The 1955\u00a0M 7.5 earthquake was the most recent event with a magnitude above 7.\nAlthough the Yalahe Fault (YLHF) is a branch fault of the Kangding segment of the XSHF, its activity remains controversial. Several researchers have suggested that the YLHF is an active Holocene fault (Allen et al., 1991; Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2001). However, one previous study believes that the YLHF has not been active since 4\u00a0Ma based on low-temperature thermochronology and geomorphology (Zhang et al., 2017). The Holocene activity of the southernmost segment of the YLHF is supported by fault outcrops and trenches at Sandaoqiao Village, which show the deformation of Holocene sediments (Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Liang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2001). Owing to poor sediment age constraint from the trench (Zhou et al., 2001), only preliminary paleoearthquake reports exist. No detailed information is known concerning the earthquake sequence, recurrence pattern, or recurrence period from the YLHF.\nIn this study, we mapped accurate fault traces and deformed landforms based on detailed interpretations of high-resolution imagery and aerial photographs combined with field observations. Geological and geomorphological evidence was obtained for the Holocene activities of the YLHF. We found two faulted sections that constrained the paleoearthquake events. The paleoearthquake history of the YLHF was documented based on the deformation of stratigraphy and fault structures in the sections and radiocarbon-14 (14C) dating of the trench horizons. Finally, we discuss the recurrence characteristics and paleoearthquake correlations of the Kangding segment.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe XSHF is located at the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Many strong earthquakes have occurred along the fault zones (Allen et al., 1991). The XSHF originated from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and formed in the late Triassic due to the orogenic period of the Songpan-Garze orogenic belt (Li et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997). The XSHF separates the Sichuan-Yunnan block from the Bayan Har block (Allen et al., 1991). It plays a notable role in the late Cenozoic crustal deformation of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Wang et al., 2008). Traditionally, the XSHF has been divided into the Luhuo, Daofu, Qianning, Kangding, and Moxi segments from north to south (Fig. 1b) (Liang, 2019). Most of the XSHF consists of a single strand, except the Kangding segment, which consists of four branches. From north to south, these faults are the Yalahe Fault (YLHF), Selaha Fault (SLHF), Mugecuo South Fault (MGCF), and Zheduotang Fault (ZDTF) (Fig. 2\n) (Li et al., 1997; Pan et al., 2020).\nBecause the Kangding segment is a special section of the XSHF, research has focused on its fault activity for several decades. Previous studies have obtained the slip rates and paleoearthquakes of the YLHF, SLHF, and ZDTF. Using GPS data and earthquake relocation, Li et al. (2020) obtained geodetic rates of SLHF and ZDTF of 5.9\u20139.1 and 0.4\u20133.4\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively. By analyzing faulted landforms and dating the sample (using TL, 14C, and 10Be), the late Quaternary tectonic-geomorphology slip rates of SLHF and ZDTF were found to be 3.7\u201310 and 3.2\u201310.5\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively. The average slip rates of the SLHF and ZDTF are ~7 and\u00a0~\u00a04\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively (Bai et al., 2018, 2021; Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Yan et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2001) (Table 1\n). There were 14 trenches along the SLHF and seven trenches along the ZDTF. Previous studies have reported 41 paleoearthquakes in the SLHF and 14 in the ZDTF (Feng, 2020; Hu et al., 2015; Li et al., 1997; Liang, 2019; Ma et al., 2020; Yan and Lin, 2017; Zhou et al., 2001) (Appendix A).\nThe YLHF strikes nearly NW, changing from 320\u00b0 to 280\u00b0, starting near Huiyuansi Temple and extending southeastward through the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot and Yala Countryside (Chen et al., 2016). The length of the YLHF is approximately 70\u00a0km. It has been reported that an ~M 7 earthquake occurred in 1700\u00a0CE along the YLHF (Wen et al., 2008). Typical faulted landforms exist along the YLHF, including rivers, terraces, fans, moraines, and crests (Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Liang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2001). Zhou et al. (2001) suggested that the Holocene active range of the YLHF ran from the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot to Wangmu village, based on paleoearthquake and alluvial fan dislocation. Zhou et al. (2001) obtained a Holocene slip rate of >2\u00a0mm\/yr near the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot (Zhou et al., 2001). Li et al. (1997) considered the Holocene active range of the YLHF to be from the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot to Xindianzi, based on the active landforms. Chen et al. (2016) determined that the active range was from Huiyuan Temple to Yala Mountain Scenic Spot, and the late Quaternary slip rate of YLHF was 0.6\u20131.5\u00a0mm\/yr based on the offset of till ridges and glacial troughs. Allen et al. (1991) inferred that the Holocene slip rate of the YLHF was 0.8\u00a0mm\/yr. Liang et al. (2020) found that the coseismic displacement of the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake was 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0m at Yalacuo Lake and thought that the active range was from the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot to Sandaoqiao Village. Li et al. (2020) obtained a geodetic YLHF rate of 0.8\u20133.8\u00a0mm\/yr based on GPS data and earthquake relocation. Three paleoearthquakes were obtained from two trenches in Wangmu village. Events 1, 2, and 3 occurred 7106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0114, 3461\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055, and 661\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0yr BP, respectively (Zhou et al., 2001). However, Zhang et al. (2017) inferred that the onset of motion along the XSHF was contemporaneous with the onset of the rapid exhumation of the Gongga batholith at \u223c9\u00a0Ma, and the YLHF, which is not active at present, was active between 9 and 4\u00a0Ma considering the low-temperature thermochronology of the batholith.\nHence, previous studies on the range of activity during the Holocene are inconsistent. The earthquake recurrence pattern cannot be constructed because of the small number of paleoearthquake events. Therefore, researching the activity and paleoearthquakes of the YLHF is of great significance for understanding the strain distribution and strong earthquake rupture mode of each branch fault in the Kangding segment of the XSHF.\n\n\n3\nMethods\nFirst, surface traces of the YLHF were mapped by conducting a field investigation and interpreting the satellite imagery. The signs for identifying the fault included fault ridges and the left-lateral offsets of landforms, such as rivers, terraces, fans, moraines, and crests. Second, to reveal the fault slip history of the YLHF, two faulted sections were collected for cleaning. In each section, we carefully cleaned the walls and documented fault structures, sedimentary characteristics (e.g., content, colour, and gravel size). The contrast colour, composition (e.g., fine gravel, coarse sand, and paleosol), and tiny structures (e.g., clumps, mixed accumulation structure) were used to identify the unit boundaries and scarp-derived colluvium exposed in each section. After logging the profile walls, approximately 100 photos were taken to cover both sections, then the Agisoft Photoscan software was used to merge these photos and generate orthogonal mosaic images for further analysis (e.g., Reitman et al., 2015).\nAt the typical faulted sites, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle to take low-altitude photos to obtain high-resolution topography using Agisoft Photoscan. The resulting hill shaded digital elevation models allow us to map the fault traces. We then used radiocarbon-14 (14C) dating methods to constrain the deposition ages of the strata. The 14C samples were prepared and analyzed at Beta Analytic Inc. (Miami, Florida, USA). Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It is a non-intrusive method of surveying the sub-surface to investigate underground utilities. GPR has many applications in several fields. In the Earth sciences, it is used to study sediment, bedrock, and fault. We used a GPR from Mal\u00e5 Geoscience Fortvaltnings AB, Sweden with 100 Mhz antennae to detect the fault below the Jingai section.\n\n\n4\nResults\nWe researched the active characteristics in two sites and cleaned their faulted sections, named SC1 and SC2, located near the Gadaliangzi and Jingai sites along the YLHF, respectively. In the following content, we present the geologic setting of each section site, stratigraphic characteristics, and paleoearthquake event determinations.\n\n4.1\nGadaliangzi\nAt the Galaliangzi site near the Huiyuansi basin, a number of seasonal rivers developed at the mountain pass, primarily depositing river terrace (T1, T2, and T3) and moraine sediments. The gullies, terraces, and moraine were displaced by the YLHF, resulting in obvious offset landforms (Fig. 3\n). T1 and the moraine on bed rock were broken, forming 15 and 46\u00a0m left-lateral dislocations, respectively (Fig. 3c). SC1 is located approximately 5\u00a0km southeast of Huiyuansi Temple. The YLHF is a wide fault zone that faults bedrock (Fig. 4\n, F1\u2013F4) and Quaternary sediments (Fig. 4, F6). The bedrock and Quaternary sediments were in fault contact (Fig. 4, F5).\n\n4.1.1\nStratigraphy\nThe length and width of SC1 were approximately 9 and 5\u00a0m, respectively. The bedrock on the northeast side of the fault zone was granite. The sediments on the southwest side of the fault zone mainly consisted of alluvial gravel layers deposited by the stream, divided into eight units. U1 and U2 are granite. The other units are Quaternary sediments (Fig. 5\n). These units were numbered in ascending order from bottom to top. The descriptions are as follows:\nU1: Bedrock (granite).\nU2: Bedrock (granite), with dense X joints.\nU3: Gravel layer (gravel diameter\u00a0<\u00a02\u00a0cm), with off-white gravel and yellow sand lenses.\nU4: Gravel layer (gravel content ~80%, gravel diameter\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0cm).\nU5: Light yellow gravel layer (the gravel content is ~50%).\nU6: Gravel layer (gravel content ~70%, gravel diameter\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0cm).\nU7: Light gray clay layer.\nU8: Light gray gravel layer.\nU9: Loose soil.\nU10: Loose sediment on the surface, with more plant roots.\n\n\n4.1.2\nEvidence of paleoearthquake events\nObvious faulting evidence was observed in the section, such as gravel orientation and stratum faulting (Fig. 6\n). Based on the deformation, discontinuity, and lithological differences of the strata, 12 faults were identified. The dip direction of most faults was NE, and the dip angle ranged from 31\u00b0 to 73\u00b0. These faults in the SC1 faulted the bedrock and Quaternary sediments. F1 and F2 developed in the bedrock, and F3 was the contact boundary between the bedrock and the Quaternary sediments. F4\u2013F10 are internal faults of the Quaternary sediments. Bedrock U2 between F2 and F3 formed dense X joints owing to tectonic stress. Based on a comprehensive analysis of paleoearthquake markers and faulting deformation, three paleoearthquake events were identified: ET1, ET2, and ET3, from youngest to oldest.\n\n4.1.2.1\nMost recent event, ET1\nStrong evidence of the latest event, ET1, is clearly presented in the section. A displacement of ~20\u00a0cm was observed between U9 and U10 along the fault, indicating that F7 ruptured upward to the ground surface and that ET1 occurred after the deposition of U9 and U10 (Fig. 5 and 6a).\n\n\n4.1.2.2\nPenultimate event, ET2\nMultiple strong pieces of evidence indicate the occurrence of penultimate event ET2 in this section. F9 is the contact boundary between U6 and U4 and is covered by U9. The strata change was obvious near F9. F5 was the contact boundary between U6 and U8 and was covered by U9. Both F5 and F9 faulted U6 and ended at the bottom of U9. Therefore, they formed during the same event, ET2.\n\n\n4.1.2.3\nThird event, ET3\nF10 faulted gravel layers U4 and the bottom of U5, which was covered by the overlying U6 layer. The top of U5 was not faulted by F10. It was displaced by ~10\u00a0cm, based on the top of U4 along the fault. Therefore, ET3 occurred during the deposition of U5.\n\n\n\n4.1.3\nRadiocarbon dating\nFive carbon samples were collected and sent to Beta Analytic Inc. for age dating using an accelerator mass spectrometer (Table 2\n), and the calendar ages were corrected using the OxCal 4.3 program. The sample ages were in normal stratigraphic order; that is, the ages of the underlying strata were older than those of the overlying strata. However, the ages of samples JWRQ-1 and JWRQ-5 from U9 were approximately 2000\u00a0years apart. This is probably because the two ages were collected at the top and bottom of U9. JWRQ-8 (18981\u201318,817\u00a0yr BP) and JWRQ-9 (22482\u201322,288\u00a0yr BP) were the ages from U5, and sample JWRQ-9 was possibly reworked from an older deposit. Samples of similar ages in the same layers were placed in a phase, and OxCal 4.3 was used to model the age of the paleoearthquake events (Lienkaemper and Ramsey, 2009).\nThe above analyses revealed that the latest event, ET1, formed after the deposition of U9 and U10, the penultimate event, ET2, formed between the deposition of U9 and U6, and ET3 occurred during the deposition of U5. The modeling results show that events ET1, ET2, and ET3 occurred in 3572\u20133450\u00a0yr BP to present, 8336\u20135465\u00a0yr BP, and near 18,981\u201318,817\u00a0yr BP, respectively (Fig. 7\n).\n\n\n\n4.2\nJingai\nJingai is located between the villages of Yusi and Wangmu. The research site is located above the alluvial fan, and the YLHF passes through gullies, alluvial fans, and bedrock (Fig. 8\n). Faulted landforms were evident in this area. The river was broken to form a beheaded river, with a 62\u00a0m left-lateral dislocation (Fig. 8c). SC2 is located approximately 300\u00a0m south of a cattle farm. At the section location, the terrain has low relief, and the erosion effect is weak, which is conducive to the accumulation of fine-grained sediments.\n\n4.2.1\nStratigraphy\nThe length and width of SC2 were approximately 18 and 10\u00a0m, respectively. The sediments consisted mainly of alluvial gravel layers deposited by the stream. It was divided into eight units, among which N1 was divided into three sublayers (N1\u20131, N1\u20132, and N1\u20133) according to the gravel diameter. C1, C2, and C3 are the fault colluvial wedges (Fig. 9\n). These strata were numbered in ascending order from bottom to top. The descriptions are as follows:\nN1: Gravel layer (poor roundness, horizontal bedding of gravel can be seen locally, and gravel diameter of N1\u20131\u2013N1\u20133 gradually decreased).\nN2: Light gray clay layer with visible drag structure.\nN3: Gravel layer (poor roundness, gravel content \u226570%, gravel diameter\u00a0~\u00a01\u20138\u00a0cm) with a yellow clay lens.\nN4: Light gray clay layer.\nN5: Gravel layer (poor roundness, gravel content \u226570%, gravel diameter\u00a0~\u00a03\u20135\u00a0cm).\nN6: Light red clay layer.\nN7: Gravel layer (poor roundness, gravel content \u226580%, gravel diameter\u00a0~\u00a01\u20133\u00a0cm).\nN8: Loose sediment on the surface, with more plant roots.\nC1\u2013C3 are colluvial wedges.\n\n\n4.2.2\nEvidence of paleoearthquake events\nIn SC2, the faults are flower structures, and four faults can be identified (F1a, F1b, F2a, and F2b). F1a, F1b, F2a, and F2b converge upward, and F2a and F2b converge to F1a. There is obvious faulting evidence in this section, such as gravel orientation, drag structure, and stratum faulting (Fig. 10\n).\nAfter rapid formation of the fault scarp, the sediment on the free surface continued to collapse. The accumulation formed at the foot of the fault scarp is a colluvial wedge (Deng et al., 1984), and is considered the main sedimentary evidence of the paleoearthquakes. Multiple surface ruptures can form multiple colluvial wedges. The sedimentary facies composition of the colluvial wedge is a lower layer of gravel and upper layer of fine-grained clastic sediments. During the interval of the earthquakes, the top of the colluvial wedge formed a soil layer due to weathering. In the case of many surface ruptures, multiple colluvial wedges and paleosol will be formed, providing an important basis for identifying paleoearthquakes. Therefore, the age of the top of the colluvial wedge can be considered close to the age of the paleoearthquake event. This is an important reason why the colluvial wedge is often used to define the age of a paleoearthquake. In SC2, we identified three colluvial wedges and dated their tops, representing three paleoearthquake events (EN2, EN3, and EN4).\n\n4.2.2.1\nMost recent event EN1\nStrong evidence of the latest event, EN1, is clearly presented in the section. A displacement of ~25\u00a0cm was observed based on N4 along F1a, indicating that F1a ruptured upward to N5\u2013N7 and was covered by N8. Therefore, EN1 occurred after the deposition of N5, N6, and N7 before that of N8.\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nPenultimate event EN2\nThere is a clear colluvial wedge (C1) next to F2b. C1 is at the top of N3, and is covered by N6. C1 is wedge-shaped with irregular borders. The gravel content of C1 is >70%. There is an obvious paleosol on the top of C1, and the age of the top of the C1 (paleosol) is close to the age of the paleoearthquake event. Thus, the age of the paleosol represents the age of penultimate event EN2.\n\n\n4.2.2.3\nThird event EN3\nNear F1a, we can clearly see C2, which is the largest of the three colluvial wedges. Its height is approximately 1.8\u00a0m. The gravel content of C2 is approximately 30%. C2 is at the top of N3 and is covered by N4; its altitude is lower than that of C1. There is an obviously paleosol on the top of C2. The age of the paleosol represents the age of the third event, EN3.\n\n\n4.2.2.4\nFourth event EN4\nC3 is located in the middle of N3, and the bottom of C2 has the lowest altitude and smallest scale. C3 is wedge-shaped with irregular borders owing to the faulted effect. The age of the top of C3 represents the age of the fourth event, EN4.\n\n\n\n4.2.3\nRadiocarbon dating\nA total of 12 carbon samples were collected and sent to Beta Analytics in the United States for age dating using an accelerator mass spectrometer (Table 3\n). The calendar ages were corrected using the OxCal 4.3 program. The ages of the samples were in normal stratigraphic order; that is, the ages of the underlying strata were older than those of the overlying strata. We found two samples, JPGM-C-1-1 and C-8-1, at the top and bottom of N8, with ages of 2660\u20132490 and 918\u2013773\u00a0yr BP, respectively. This proves that the deposition of N8 occurred over a long period of time. However, the age of sample JGPM-C-2-1 (5478\u20135319\u00a0yr BP) from N6 was younger than that of C-5-2 (6395\u20136280\u00a0yr BP) from N5. This explains the formation of N6 before that of N5. The age of sample C-4-1 (9309\u20139088\u00a0yr BP) was similar to that of JGPM-C-7-1 (9536\u20139426\u00a0yr BP). This indicates that the two samples were from the same layer (N4). The samples with similar ages in the same layers were placed in a phase, and the OxCal 4.3 program was used to model the age of paleoearthquake events similar to trench SC1.\nThe above analyses revealed that the latest event, EN1, occurred between the depositions of N6 and N8. Three colluvial wedges are revealed in the section (C1, C2, and C3) representing three paleoearthquake events: EN2, EN3, and EN4, respectively. The modeling results show that events EN1, EN2, EN3, and EN4 occurred during the ranges of 5478\u20132490, 6319\u20136269, 10,437\u201310,252, and 20,975\u201320,749\u00a0yr BP, respectively (Fig. 11\n).\n\n\n4.2.4\nGPR deep exploration\nWe used a GPR with a 100\u00a0MHz antennae to detect strata and faults nearly 3\u00a0m below SC2. The GPR results reveal the strata and faults below the section, and F1a below the section was found to be the main fault of the flower structure. Within 40\u00a0cm, the lineups were relatively continuous. This represents the soil layer on the surface. Below 40\u00a0cm, lineups were no longer continuous. The intensity of the reflected wave signal on both sides of the fault was different. The strata signal of the downthrown side was weak, which may be related to the lithology. Strata on both sides of the fault below 1.5\u00a0m displayed an obvious drag structure owing to the fault effect (Fig. 9c).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nPaleoearthquake sequence\nThe progressive constraining method was used to constrain paleoearthquake events and ages in the two sections and one trench (Fig. 12\n). The trench across the scarp in Wangmu village revealed that the fault cut the surface soil layer, and the layer under the surface soil layer formed in 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE; therefore, the most recent event (EV1) occurred after 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE (Zhou et al., 2001). SC1 in Gadaliangzi indicated that F7 ruptured upward to the ground surface, and the most recent event (ET1) occurred after the deposition of U9 and U10. The upper part of U9 formed during 3572\u20133450\u00a0yr BP. Therefore, ET1 occurred between 3572 and 3450\u00a0yr BP. In 1700\u00a0CE, there was a strong earthquake event near Kangding, which is considered to have occurred in the YLHF (Wen et al., 2008). The most recent events, EV1 and ET1, identified in the trench and SC1 were interpreted as the same event (E1 of the fault). Based on existing historical earthquake data, the most recent event E1 of the YLHF is most likely the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake.\nThe trench across the scarp in Wangmu village revealed that the penultimate event (EV2) occurred after 1460\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055\u00a0BCE (Zhou et al., 2001). SC2 in Jingai revealed that the latest event, EN1, occurred between the deposition of N6 and N8. N6 and N8 formed during 5478\u20135319 and 2660\u20132490\u00a0yr BP, respectively. EN1 occurred during 5478\u20132490\u00a0yr BP. Strong evidence of penultimate event EN1 was observed in SC1. In addition, the ages of ET1 in SC1, EV2 in the trench, and EN1 in SC2 overlap in 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP. Therefore, the penultimate event E2 of the YLHF likely occurred in 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP. SC1 revealed that both F5 and F9 faulted U6 and ended at the bottom of U9. They formed during the same event, ET2. The lower part of U9 and U6 formed in 5587\u20135465 and 8336\u201381,983\u00a0yr BP, respectively. ET2 occurred between 8336 and 5465\u00a0yr BP. Wangmu village trench (ZT) is a relatively short distance away, about 5\u00a0km apart from SC2, the two sites are likely to rupture together. The third event, EV3, in the Wangmu village trench (ZT) occurred in 5105 BCE\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0114 (Zhou et al., 2001). There is a clear colluvial wedge C1 in SC2 that represents EN2. C1 formed during 6319\u20136269\u00a0yr BP. Considering the error between the date of the carbon sample from the colluvial wedge and the date of the related earthquake event, EN2 and EV3 actually be the same event. Therefore, event E3 of the YLHF likely occurred in 7168\u20136269\u00a0yr BP.\nThe age of EN2 in SC2 and ET2 in SC1 overlap in 6319\u20136269\u00a0yr BP. The ages of EV3 in the trench and ET2 in SC1 overlap in 7168\u20136940\u00a0yr BP. Therefore, the third and fourth events E3 and E4 of the YLHF likely occurred in 6319\u20136269 and 7168\u20136940\u00a0yr BP, respectively.\nThe age of colluvial wedge C2 in SC2 represents the age of EN3. EN3 occurred in 10,437\u201310,252\u00a0yr BP. Event ET3 in SC1 occurred during the deposition of U5. The modeling results show that ET3 occurred near 18,981\u201318,817\u00a0yr BP. The age of the colluvial wedge C3 in SC2 represents the age of the fourth event, EN4. EN4 occurred in 20,975\u201320,749\u00a0yr BP. These three events occurred over a long period of time. They were not observed in other trenches or sections. Therefore, these three earthquake events, EN3, ET3, and EN4, are independent of each other and represent E4, E5, and E6 of the YLHF, respectively.\nIn summary, six paleoearthquakes occurring since 21,000\u00a0yr BP were constrained from two sections and one trench. The ages of events E6\u2013E1, from oldest to youngest, are 20,975\u201320,749, 18,981\u201318,817, 10,437\u201310,252, 7168\u20136269, and 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP, and after 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE, respectively, and the most recent event may correspond to the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake.\n\n\n5.2\nRecurrence characteristics and paleoearthquake correlations\nFour events E1\u2013E4 occurred in the Holocene. Their intervals are 2728, 3741, and 3626\u00a0yr, respectively. This indicates that the average recurrence interval between E1 and E4 was 3365\u00a0yr. The event intervals in the Holocene are close. Two events, E5 and E6, occurred during the late Pleistocene. The intervals between E4 and E5, and E5 and E6, were 8555 and 1963\u00a0yr, respectively. Erosion from precipitation is strong in the study area, and the sedimentary strata may be discontinuous. After adding two events in the late Pleistocene, the average recurrence interval between E1 and E6 changes to 4122\u00a0yr. Taking long-term events into account, the average recurrence interval becomes longer and the possibility of missing events is greater. In particular, in the interval between E4 and E5, the events during this period were possibly not recorded in this 8555-yr interval. The interval between events E1 and E2 (2726\u00a0yr) longer than the interval between E2 and E3 (3741\u00a0yr). This indicates that the recurrence period of recent earthquakes has decreased.\nIn recent years, the coefficient of variation (CoV) of the recurrence interval has been increasingly used to quantitatively describe the recurrence behavior of earthquakes (Biasi and Scharer, 2015; Goes and Ward, 1994; Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 1994). To quantify the seismic recurrence behavior of the YLHF, we calculated the CoV of the recurrence interval of paleoearthquakes. CoV\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3T\/\n\nT\n\u00af\n\n, where \u03c3T is the standard deviation of the recurrence interval, and \n\nT\n\u00af\n\n is the average recurrence interval (Guo et al., 2019). Based on the above formula and the recurrence intervals between the four Holocene paleoearthquakes, the CoV of the fault was calculated to be 0.13, indicating that the fault follows a quasiperiodic recurrence model (Kagan and Jackson, 1991). If the six events (E1\u2013E6) are considered during the calculation, the long interval between E4 and E5 would cause the CoV to increase to 0.56 but still indicate a quasiperiodic earthquake recurrence pattern. Therefore, the time interval of 2728\u00a0yr between the last two events is close to the average recurrence interval of 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene. The average recurrence interval of 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene is more representative of the recent fault activity than the earthquake recurrence interval of 4122\u00a0yr, averaged from the six events. The elastic rebound model (Reid, 1910) is the basic theory for studying the behavior of seismic activity (Matthews et al., 2002). It is an efficient method that uses the paleoearthquake recurrence interval and coseismic displacement to constrain the horizontal slip rate of the fault according to elastic rebound theory (Ran et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2013). Liang (2019) found the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake coseismic displacement of 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0m at Yalacuo Lake. The average recurrence interval was 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene. Based on the coseismic displacement and recurrence interval, it is estimated that its horizontal slip rate is approximately 0.7\u20131\u00a0mm\/yr. It conforms to the late Quaternary tectonic-geomorphology (0.8\u20132\u00a0mm\/yr) (Allen et al., 1991; Chen et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2001) and GPS slip rates (0.8\u20133.8\u00a0mm\/yr) (Li et al., 2020).\nWe collected paleoearthquake data from the SLHF and ZDTF and used the progressive constraining method to constrain their events and ages in Holocene. Thus, 14 SLHF events and seven ZDTF events since 12\u00a0ka were obtained. For SLHF events, the results show that E1 and ES1, E2 and ES9, E3 and ES12, and E4 and ES14 overlap in time. For ZDTF, the results show that E1 and EZ2 overlap in time (Fig. 13\n). This shows that the YLHF and two adjacent faults (SLHF and ZDTF) may experience cascading rupture in the same earthquake. The paleoearthquakes of the YLHF and SLHF are more correlated owing to their close distances.\n\n\n5.3\nKinematic property and role in accommodating regional tectonic deformation\nThe XSHF is dominated by left-lateral strike-slip activity at the eastern boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan block. It exhibits an arcuate shape that is convex northeast. While the NW XSHF has a single, linear, and continuous trace-striking N135\u00b0E for \u223c180\u00a0km, its geometry changes dramatically near the Kangding segment, where it splits into the four en echelon faults discussed here (YLHF-SLHF-MGCF-ZDTF) before resuming as a single fault trace striking N160\u00b0E (the Moxi segment) (Bai et al., 2021; Li et al., 1997; Pan et al., 2020). All four en echelon faults are left-striking. The YLHF exhibits an arcuate shape that is convex northeast. The strike of the fault zone changes from NWW in the northern segment to NW in the central segment, and to NNW in the southern segment. The strike changes of the XSHF and YLHF were similar, and the YLHF strike change was a microcosm of the XSHF in the Kangding segment. The two sections in this study revealed that the YLHF presents a normal dip-slip component and creates a negative flower structure. The change in the strike of the YLHF is accompanied by a change in the kinematic properties, indicating that the compression between the Sichuan-Yunnan block and the Bayan Har block reached a peak, which changed the strike of the XSHF. These changes were likely caused by the apparent change in the direction of clockwise rotation of the Sichuan-Yunnan block around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis and the blocking effect of the South China block on the Sichuan-Yunnan block.\nOur results suggest that the average earthquake recurrence interval of the YLHF since ~12,000\u00a0yr is 3365\u00a0yr, which is shorter than the 5020-yr interval of the SLHF (Liang, 2019) but longer than the 500\u20132000-yr interval of the ZDTF (Li et al., 1997). Furthermore, it was first qualitatively inferred as 0.8\u00a0mm\/yr (Allen et al., 1991), before being constrained to >2\u00a0mm\/yr since 10\u00a0ka (Zhou et al., 2001) and 0.6\u20131.5\u00a0mm\/yr since 70\u00a0ka (Chen et al., 2016) from thermoluminescence ages. Therefore, assuming similar rates of 0.8 to >2.2\u00a0mm\/yr along the YLHF, and the tectonic-geomorphology average slip rates of SLHF and ZDTF are ~7 and\u00a0~\u00a04\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively (Bai et al., 2018, 2021; Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Yan et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2001). The total late Quaternary slip rate across the YLHF, SLHF, and ZDTF was ~12\u00a0mm\/yr. Note that this rate is minimal because the rate along the Mugecuo South Fault is currently unknown. The YLHF shares part of the slip rate with the single-stranded XSHF. Based on the geometric analysis and structures in depth along the Kangding segment, YLHF, SLHF, MGCF, and ZDTF converged into one fault at a depth of approximately 15\u00a0km, and a flower-shaped structure was observed above this depth (Bai et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). Therefore, the YLHF has the ability to cause large earthquakes in the future, similar to SLHF and ZDTF.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nA detailed investigation of the paleoearthquake events of the YLHF and information collected from the Kangding segment yielded the following conclusions:\n(1) The Holocene active range of the YLHF ran from Huiyuan Temple to Jingai, based on paleoearthquake and geomorphological evidence.\n(2) Six recent paleoearthquake events of the YLHF were revealed using tectonic geomorphology, trench excavations, and radiocarbon dating. They were labeled E6\u2013E1 from oldest to youngest and occurred during 20,975\u201320,749, 18,981\u201318,817, 10,437\u201310,252, 7168\u20136269, and 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP, and after 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE, respectively; the most recent event may correspond to the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake.\n(3) The YLHF features a quasiperiodic earthquake recurrence pattern. The average recurrence interval was 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene. YLHF, SLHF, YLHF, and ZDTF may exhibit cascading ruptures during the same earthquake.\n(4) The deformed strata in the trenches show that the YLHF presents a normal dip-slip component and creates a negative flower structure, indicating that the fault is characterized kinematically by transtension.\n(5) The average earthquake recurrence interval of the YLHF since ~12,000\u00a0yr is 3365\u00a0yr, which is shorter than the interval of the SLHF, but longer than the interval of the ZDTF. The YLHF accumulates part of the slip rate of the single-stranded XSHF. Therefore, the YLHF has the ability to generate large earthquakes in the future, similar to SLHF and ZDTF.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJun Ma: Methodology, Software, Validation, Supervision.

The mission is dedicated to study the interior of Mars through seismology and heat flux. The main instrument, the seismometer SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2019, 2020) has successfully been deployed in January 2019 and it has been continuously recording the seismic activity of Mars since February 2019. The recorded seismic data have shown that Mars is seismically active with more than 900 \u201cmarsquakes\u201d detected in the v9 catalog released by the InSight Marsquake Service (MQS) which covers events detection until 2022\/01\/01. For more details on the MQS catalogs, see Giardini et al (2020), InSight Marsquake and Service (2021) and InSight Marsquake and Service (2022). The global seismic event rate sets Mars as moderately active, between the weak lunar activity and the terrestrial intraplate seismicity (Banerdt et al, 2020). However, no marsquakes of magnitude greater than four have been reported in MQS v9 and only a fraction of events exhibit clear body waves arrivals. In addition, none of the events show surface waves of amplitude greater than the Martian noise (Giardini et al, 2020), and depth phases pP and sS are difficult to identify in the data, making it complicated to estimate the hypocenter depths.\nDespite their low magnitude, the ten largest recorded low frequency events have been used for determining the first internal structure models of Mars from the crust to the core (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Khan et al, 2021; Knapmeyer-Endrun et al, 2021; St\u00e4hler et al, 2021). More specifically, based on the receiver functions study of Lognonn\u00e9 et al (2020) and confirmed in Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), the first ten kilometers of the upper crust beneath the InSight landing site appear highly altered and fractured. Below this first crustal discontinuity, as proposed by the seismic reflected phases analysis of Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), two models are described with two and three layers. For both velocity models, the martian equivalent of Moho discontinuity is located at 20 \u00b1 5km depth, and an additional discontinuity at 39 \u00b1 8km depth is estimated in the case of the three layers model. On a more regional scale, the upper mantle has been constrained with the first clear identifications of secondary phases, PP, PPP, SS and SSS (Khan et al, 2021) which confirmed an upper mantle structure controlled by a thermal lithosphere with a 400\u2013500km thickness. Finally, the observation of ScS core phases (St\u00e4hler et al, 2021) provided the first seismic estimation of the core radius at 1830\u00b140km.\nOn the source aspects and after the first magnitude estimations of Giardini et al (2020) and InSight Marsquake and Service (2021), Brinkman et al. (2021) have performed the first Martian moment tensors inversion for the two largest events, S0173a and S0235b. They not only highlighted the fact that single station methodology is sufficient to obtain stable and interpretable focal mechanism solutions but got also results in strong agreement with orbital imagery observations of an extensive regime and the global azimuths of Cerberus fossae. They also demonstrate the robustness of an inversion exclusively based on body waves despite strong assumptions on the internal model.\nWith an additional year of monitoring, we can now add seven additional LF and BB events to continue this single station source inversion. Even if less powerful than S0173a and S0235b, these new events are characterized by clear arrivals of P and S waves, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and magnitude \n\nM\nw\n\n larger than 3 (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021 and see Table 1\n for details). They have been located between 25 and 40 to the east of InSight (i.e. corresponding to distances of 1500\u20132500km) with 3 to 4 error ellipsoids (from MQS catalog, InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021, and based on Drilleau et al, 2022 estimations). Five of them, like S0173a and S0235b, are located in the vicinity of the Cerberus fossae faults (Fig. 1\n) and confirm its seismicity. Cerberus fossae is a major graben system (e.g.\nVetterlein and Roberts, 2010; Roberts et al, 2012) and one of the largest structures close to the InSight landing site. Before the InSight mission, it was already studied with remote sensing data (Knapmeyer et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2013) and was already referred as a potential seismic source with an average annual seismic moment release of 1015-1017 Nm\/yr (Taylor et al, 2013; Perrin et al, 2022). In addition, recent volcanic activity is inferred in the region of Elysium Planitia (Vaucher et al, 2009; Hauber et al, 2011) and potentially associated with the regional seismic activity. The remaining event S0784a is located further south, and event S0325a is located on the Martian dichotomy that separates the contrasting terrains of the north and south and characterized by crustal structural complexities.\nThe main motivation of our study is that these marsquakes exhibit specific characteristics typical of tectonic earthquakes and located near peculiar volcanic\/tectonic features. Consequently, here we propose a seismo-tectonic analysis of the region to the east of InSight by constraining the seismic moment tensor of the nine seismic events aforementioned. The moment tensor is a good geometrical representation of the seismic source and is classically used to describe the faulting motion at the origin of quakes (e.g.,\nMolnar and Sykes, 1969; Michael, 1987; Henry et al, 2002). With InSight we are fortunate to be able to process the first seismic data on Mars, although restricted by the fact that there is currently only one seismic station on the ground surface. On the contrary, on Earth, seismic signals are usually recorded from dozen to hundreds of stations. The Earth data are moreover very well located geographically and at depth, compared to Martian data. Earth-based moment tensor analyses from a single station are only preliminary or exceptional works and from signals with a fairly larger SNR. Moreover, the internal structure is much better constrained for the Earth with high resolution 3D velocity models built from multiple decades of data accumulation.\nAfter Brinkman et al. (2021), the seven additional events will allow us to explore more deeply the seismo-tectonic context of Elysium Planitia. For that matter, we invert the moment tensors and discuss the results in terms of seismic origins, linked with the morphological observations of the region. Our methodology is principally based on a grid-search exploration over the three double-couple angles, i.e. the strike, the dip and the rake. For that matter, we invert P and S waveforms while estimating the seismic moment and the seismic attenuation. We also invert and compare the amplitudes of the secondary phases PP, SS, PPP and SSS following their identification by Khan et al (2021) and Drilleau et al (2022). In addition, we provide estimates for the hypocenter depths and we then discuss why the absence of surface wave observations in the SEIS records do not exclude a crustal origin.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we first describe the general geological context and in Section 3 we present the InSight seismic data. In Section 4 we explain the inversion method. Then, the detailed results for S0235b and the general results of the nine marsquakes are presented in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss the potential seismic sources, by comparing the selected mechanisms with the nearby major structures.\n\n\n2\nRegional context\nInSight has landed in Elysium Planitia at 4.5N 1356E, south of the Elysium Mons volcanic structure and near the dichotomy boundary (Fig. 1). From crater counting and geological unit series, the landing site is characterized by geological structures aged from Hesperian (3.7 to 3.2 Ga ago) to Early Amazonian (3.2 Ga to few ka ago, Tanaka et al, 1992; Warner et al, 2017; Golombek et al, 2018, 2020). The marsquakes S0173a, S0235b, S0407a, S0409d, S0484b, S0809a and S0820a are centered on the Cerberus fossae system while S0784a is located on lava plains in the southern vicinity of InSight and S0325a is located at the dichotomy boundary. Marsquakes S0173a, S0235b, S0809a and S0820a ellipsoids are determined by the InSight MQS InSight Marsquake and Service (2021) (green ellipsoids on Fig. 1) and the events S0325a, S0407a, S0409d, S0484b and S0784a are located by Drilleau et al (2022) (purple ellipsoids on Fig. 1). The location errors are large, ranging from \u00b1 3 (about \u00b1200km) to \u00b1 5 (about \u00b1300km) depending on the data quality. The ellipsoids can therefore cut across several regions over several hundreds of kilometers (e.g. in the case of S0484b which extends from Elysium Mons to the south of the Cerberus fossae system).\nThe center part of our study area is located on the Elysium Planitia terrains, expanding from the high plateaus of Aeolis and Zephyria, crossing the channels of Athabasca Valles and the graben systems of Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles (thick red lines on Fig. 1). Elysium Planitia, and more generally Mars, demonstrates many evidences of simultaneous or contemporaneous ages of hydrological and volcanic processes, notably with the observations of surficial guiding channels filled with lava flows (Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Burr et al, 2002; Plescia, 2003; Jaeger et al, 2007). The youngest lava flows are dated from 300Ma to 20Ma based on crater dating studies (Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Vaucher et al, 2009; Hauber et al, 2011) and originated from recent volcanic activity in the central plains of Elysium Planitia form the Cerberus fossae volcanic unit. The fissures of Cerberus fossae would have enabled the flow of large volumes of these lavas as recently as 2.5Ma ago (Vaucher et al, 2009; Golder et al, 2020), and then escaping towards Athabasca Valles (Burr et al, 2002; Plescia, 2003; Vaucher et al, 2009). It has been also suggested that other channels surrounding Grjot\u00e1 Valles have been formed by catastrophic overflows (Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Burr et al, 2002; Plescia, 2003). The large amounts of lava that have rapidly emerged from these channels have led to the hypothesis that massive dike networks exist in the subsurface (Ernst et al, 2001). These inferences would be in favor of a rather recent and dominant volcanic activity. Besides, magma transport and the potential magmatic chamber pressurization are known to generate seismicity on Earth (Grandin et al, 2012; Carrier et al, 2015).\nCerberus fossae (red thick lines in Fig. 1) is described by Perrin et al (2022), Taylor et al (2013) and Vetterlein and Roberts (2010) as a possible large dike-induced graben system of \u223c1200km long located at 1500km in the north-east of the InSight lander and in the northern part of Elysium Planitia. The orientation of the fossae (N100-110E) is coherent with the geometry of the supposed underlying dikes radiating away from Elysium Mons (Ernst et al, 2001). In addition, the Elysium Mons volcanic edifice is at the origin of a regional loading of the lithosphere with a negative Bouguer gravity anomaly (Neumann et al, 2004; Belleguic et al, 2005; Baratoux et al, 2014, and see Supplementary material S12), and may has experienced several and continuous episodes of activity between 4 and 2 Ga ago (Platz and Michael, 2011; Pasckert et al, 2012; Pan et al, 2020). The deformation associated with this regional loading may have impacted the formation of Cerberus fossae. Besides, Perrin et al (2022) observed that the widths and throws along the fossae decreased eastward, suggesting long-term propagation of the deformation away from Elysium Mons. This also implies that seismic activity is possible in the eastern, younger and less evolved parts of Cerberus fossae. Taylor et al (2013) have furthermore proposed that the recent tectonics activity of Cerberus fossae is less than 10 Myr, and they described the faults as active seismic sources with a general estimated seismic moment release of 1015-1017 Nm\/yr. This last value is larger than the observed Martian seismicity by about two orders of magnitude (Giardini et al, 2020). However, the seismic data recorded by InSight are consistent with the estimate by Taylor et al (2013) of 1.5 to 1.9 x 105 events generated per year from Cerberus fossae and furthermore, correspond to the present seismicity of Cerberus, while the one estimated from remote sensing is averaged since the onset of Cerberus activity. These two estimations can therefore be more coherent if one assume a time decrease of the seismicity of Cerberus. A dozen of events have indeed been detected and located in the vicinity of the graben system (Drilleau et al, 2022; InSight Marsquake and Service, 2022 and Fig. 1), although their exact seismic origin is not firmly established (see Section 6).\nThe southern end of the study area (red-yellow cratered terrains in Fig. 1) encompasses the Martian dichotomy in the Terra Cimmeria lands including the Apollinaris volcano and the ancient flood valley of Al Qahira Vallis. The dichotomy is a giant planetary structure located around the planet's equator and separating the oldest cratered highlands in the south aged about 4 Ga (Tanaka et al, 2011), from the younger lowlands in the north dated between 3 Ga and several ka ago (Tanaka et al, 2011). The highlands and the lowlands have a ground elevation difference of 4 to 6km. The dichotomy boundary has formed very early and has been subjected to many sedimentary accumulations and morphological reworking in a large part of the history of Mars (Frey et al, 2002). These successive sedimentary and volcanic processes have led to the formation of complex structures in the shallow crust of Mars including the upper regolith (Tanaka et al, 2011; Golombek et al, 2018; Pan et al, 2020). These complexities, as well as the very pronounced relative elevation contrast between the two hemispheres, are suspected to destabilize the seismic propagation notably by adding reverberation or crustal diffraction (Tauzin et al, 2019; Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Knapmeyer-Endrun et al, 2021).\n\n\n3\nSeismic data from SEIS\/InSight\n\n3.1\nData generalities: frequency content and quality\nThe InSight seismic events are named according to the Martian sol (the Martian day since the beginning of the mission) on which they occurred and numbered in alphabetical order, e.g., S0235b occurred on 235th sol, after S0235a.\nFirst, the seismic event classification is done according to the frequency band in which the marsquakes have the most energy (for a complete overview of the seismic events classification, see Clinton et al, 2021). Thus, two main families are identified, the family of low-frequency events where the energy is observed mostly below 2.4Hz, and the high-frequency events family with energy mostly above 2.4Hz.\nThe family of low-frequency events contains the LF events (low-frequency), whose main energy lies below 2.4Hz, and the BB events (broadband) events, with their main energy below 2.4Hz but with a possible excitation above 2.4Hz. The LF and BB events are quite similar to each other. Their signals are characterized by an overall duration generally of 10 to 20 minutes with two distinct P and S phases, where the S-wave is more amplified than the P-wave. The SNR of these events is the highest among the entire seismic events catalog, on average from 2.5 to 20, and up to a factor of 200 (Banerdt et al, 2020; Giardini et al, 2020; InSight Marsquake and Service, 2022). Besides, spectrum analyses of LF and BB events have shown that they are similar to teleseismic earthquakes and shallow moonquakes (Banerdt et al, 2020; Giardini et al, 2020). Brinkman et al. (2021) further concluded on a probable tectonic origin with little diffraction for three LF\/BB events (i.e., S0173a, S0235b and S0183a) and suggested that S0235b and S0173a share a common origin. The low-frequency family is thus constituted by tectonic events, and we focus exclusively on their seismo-tectonic analysis in this manuscript.\nThe second family, the high-frequency events, includes the 2.4Hz, the HF (high-frequency), the VF (very high-frequency) and the SF (super high-frequency) events (see van Driel et al, 2021 for a complete description of the high-frequency family). The 2.4Hz events are excited around 2.4Hz with a very limited excitation above or below. HF events are centered on 2.4Hz and above mainly. A special case of HF, the VF, are characterized by a significantly larger energy on the horizontal components than on the vertical component at high frequencies. Finally, a last class identified are the SF seismic events with energy at more than 5Hz and up to 50Hz. The HF, VF and 2.4Hz are not located, so their analysis is based exclusively on the interpretation of their spectrum, and they are suggested to be small and shallow marsquakes (Clinton et al, 2021; van Driel et al, 2021). The SF are supposed to be related to local thermal variations (Dahmen et al, 2021).\nIn addition, all of the recorded marsquakes are classified with a quality grade from A to D (Clinton et al, 2021). From MQS definitions, quality A quakes correspond to high SNR events with clearly identified phases as well as the polarization of the P-wave and the S-wave trains, which provides the back-azimuth (BAZ) of the epicenter. Quality B events are very similar to quality A in terms of phases identification and waveforms, but without clear polarization and therefore less precise BAZ. For the C quality data, phases are observed but, either they are not identified, or only a single phase is identified, or multiple phases are identifiable but no clear P and S-waves can be attributed to them. The D quality events are the lowest quality data and are characterized by weak signals, or are likely not attributable to a seismic event (suspicious data). Since 2019, InSight has recorded a majority of high frequency events family, with more than 700 2.4Hz events, more than 1000 SF, 95 HF and 56 VF, whereas only 44 LF and 25 BB events have been recorded to date (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2022). 6 events are of quality A (LF\/BB events exclusively), 133 are of quality B, more than 500 are of quality C and more than 800 are of quality D.\nThe InSight seismic data (InSight Mars SEIS Data Service, 2019) contain large amounts of glitches, described as a transient instrumental noise likely associated to thermal tilts or dislocations (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Scholz et al, 2020). In practice, glitches are characterized by a high amplitude pulse of generally 10\u22128\nm\/s. Two of our selected LF events, S0173a and S0409d, are contaminated on the P-wave by glitches. Fortunately, S0173a glitch arrives long enough after the main P-wave peak and does not affect our calculations, while we use the deglitched S0409d time series (with the IPGP deglitching technique, Scholz et al, 2020).\nIn this study, we select nine marsquakes exclusively in LF\/BB frequency ranges and of qualities A and B. They all display clear picks of P- and S-waves, high SNR, and have been located with small error bars (see Section 3.2 below).\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic event locations and depths\nEvents S0173a, S0235b, S0809a and S0820a have been located by MQS (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021; Giardini et al, 2020). These locations are shown by the green probability ellipsoids on Fig. 1. The BAZ was calculated from polarization analysis of the first P-waveform and the epicentral distance was deduced from the P\u2013S time delay and pre-launch a priori velocity models (Khan et al, 2016; B\u00f6se et al, 2017; Clinton et al, 2017).\nThe recent work from Drilleau et al (2022) proposes additional BAZ values for other qualities A and B events. This is measured with the energy along the horizontal component, in addition to correlation and coherency coefficients between horizontal and vertical components. These BAZ estimations and epicentral distances are moreover in good agreement with MQS ones for the quality A events, and allow to add news locations for 5 quality B events (S0325a, S0407a, S0409d, S0484b and S0784a). Their locations are represented by the purple ellipsoids on Fig. 1. The epicentral distance, BAZ and origin time of all events are listed in Table 1.\nThe depths of the events are not precisely known, but the values are in agreement for seismic sources at moderate depths below the Moho (\u223c 30km with large errors) for most of the LF\/BB events (Brinkman et al., 2021; Drilleau et al, 2022). However, the observed pP and sS depth phases (Brinkman et al., 2021, Drilleau et al, 2022 and St\u00e4hler et al, 2021) provide depth constraints with uncertainties of several tens of kilometers. Last but not least, the lack of clear observations of surface waves in the InSight data does not seem to support shallow seismic sources. This raises concerns about the nature of the source and the link with shallow and\/or crustal tectono-volcanic activity, and will be addressed later in Section 6.\n\n\n\n4\nMoment tensor inversion methodology\nWith only one seismic station and the uncertainties on Mars structure and a strong observed scattering (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Karakostas et al, 2021; Menina et al, 2021; van Driel et al, 2021) we had to adapt the classical moment tensor inversion method used on terrestrial data. Our approach is based on a grid-search exploration method for which we are seeking three source parameters: strike, dip and rake angles. Therefore, this inversion resolves the double-couple (DC) solutions of the moment tensors and will restrict the analyses to fractures or faulting sources. The isotropic (ISO) and compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) components of the moment tensor will therefore be ignored, which might be a limiting factor for tremor sources in Cerberus fossae (Kedar et al., 2021). The DC components represent the fault direction (strike), steepness (dip), and movement (rake) and are visualized in a spherical space through focal mechanisms (Jost and Herrmann, 1989; Henry et al, 2002). In addition, the solutions are non-unique following two conjugate fault planes (or nodal planes), which correspond to the two triplets of strike, dip and rake angles.\nFor each parameters combination, we compute a cost function composed by several fitting terms with weighting factors. Those with the lowest cost function correspond to the best-predicted moment tensor solutions. The methodology differences with Brinkman et al. (2021) are the following:\n\n\u2022\nin order to improve the waveform fitting, we also explore the apparent attenuation of the direct phases through an apparent quality factor Q. As compared to previous estimations which inverted Q and the seismic moment through displacement spectral fitting (Giardini et al, 2020), the Q factor and the seismic moment M\n0 are inverted in the time domain for ground velocity, taking advantage that the InSight noise has been found flat in ground velocity in the bandwidth of interest (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Stutzmann et al., 2021) and can therefore be considered as white. This is likely reducing the impact of long period noise in the inversion.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn addition to the body waveform fitting, we add the fitting of the secondary phase amplitudes of PP, SS, PPP and SSS as supplementary constrains.\n\n\n\u2022\nLast but not least, we account for the non-observation of surface waves and reject solutions with synthetic surface wave amplitudes larger than recorded amplitudes in the data surface wave windows.\n\n\n\n\n4.1\nSynthetic seismograms computation\nWe use the Direct Solution Method (DSM) Kernel Suite (Geller and Ohminato, 1994; Geller and Takeuchi, 1995; Fuji et al, 2012, 2016) for an efficient Green's functions computations, this being done for the six components of DC source and all distances between source and stations.\nIn our case, DSM is computing synthetics for a spherically symmetric Mars model with discontinuities. We use the \u201cTAYAK\u201d model (Khan et al, 2016), which integrated the pre-launch knowledge on Mars (Smrekar et al, 2019), but modified it to account for the crustal structure, as constrained by the receiver functions analysis of Lognonn\u00e9 et al (2020) and Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021).\nThis updated TAYAK model is displayed on Fig. 2\n. The crust includes therefore a first interface at 10km (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020) and has the crust-mantle discontinuity at 24km (Knapmeyer-Endrun et al, 2021), which we will simplify with the term \u201cMoho\u201d hereafter. Another modified TAYAK model with a 3rd discontinuity boundary at 43km depth (potentially the Moho discontinuity) as proposed by Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), has also been used for sensitivity tests in Supplementary material S11. Our inversion methodology does not invert the arrival times of the direct phases nor those of the secondary phases but explore differences in attenuation. We are therefore mostly sensitive to the differences in the elastic geometrical spreading with respect to other models, including those recently proposed by Khan et al (2021) and St\u00e4hler et al (2021). These differences are integrated in the final determination of the seismic moment, but not in the geometry of the source.\nThe DSM Green's functions are pre-calculated up to 0.8Hz (or period of 1.25 sec) at the fixed epicentral distances and BAZs compiled on Table 1. The synthetics cover therefore the bandwidth used for inversion, which is generally 0.1\u20130.5Hz. They are computed with source depths up to 90km, which includes widely the depth ranges proposed by Brinkman et al. (2021), Drilleau et al (2022) or Khan et al (2021).\nThe synthetics are computed with a very low attenuation, i.e. a large initial quality factor Q\n0 of 2000 and the phase attenuation is therefore modeled in the phase inversion process.\n\n\n4.2\nTime series pre-processing and inversion setup\nWe pre-process the 20 sps (sample per second) SEIS VBB raw data by detrending and removing the instrumental response, from counts to ground velocity. A high pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.006Hz was used in the instrument correction.\nThe three axis VBB data, as recorded on the sensor directions U,V,W, are then rotated to vertical-radial-transverse (ZRT) components based on the event BAZs (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021; Drilleau et al, 2022). The same is made for the synthetics from ZNE to ZRT. Then, the time series are band pass filtered, in bandwidths depending on the energy content of each event (the considered parameters are listed on Table 1).\n\n\n4.3\nMoment tensor grid search: generation of synthetics\nThe first grid-search exploration is conducted in the depth range of 12 \u2013 90km with a 3km step. For each depth, we explore all moment tensor geometries with strike, dip and rake respectively between 0 and 360, with a 9 step, between 0 and 90, with a 4 step and between \u2212180 and 180, with a 9 step. Then strike, dip and rake are converted into the full moment tensor components M\n\nrr\n, M\n\n\u03b8\u03b8\n, M\n\n\u03d5\u03d5\n, M\n\nr\u03b8\n, M\n\nr\u03d5\n and M\n\n\u03b8\u03d5\n where r, \u03b8 and \u03d5 correspond to spherical coordinates in the up-south-east convention. The six corresponding synthetic Green's function are then multiplied by these components and summed up to generate the synthetic corresponding to an unitary moment tensor (MT).\n\n4.3.1\nP and S waveform fits: quality factor, seismic moment and phase shift\nDue to the uncertainties on the velocity model and in order to adjust the amplitude of the synthetics to the data, we perform a secondary grid-search over the seismic attenuation 1\/Q and phase shift and invert linearly the associated seismic moment M\n0.\nThe seismic attenuation integrates both the intrinsic (Q\n\ni\n) and scattering (Q\n\nc\n) and is generally approximated as 1\/Q\n=1\/Q\n\ni\n\n+1\/Q\n\nc\n (Romanowicz and Mitchell, 2015). It is far to be at this time constrained for Mars, and proposed values for Q\n\nS\n are of the order of 300\u2013500 for lithospheric path (Brinkman et al., 2021; Giardini et al., 2020). On the long period side of the LF-BB events (0.1\u20130.5Hz), assuming a predominance of intrinsic attenuation mostly related to shear is a reasonable approximation, which leads to Q\n\nP\n\n\u221d9\/4\u00b7\nQ\n\nS\n. On the shorter period side (0.5\u20132.5Hz), scattering is likely dominating, with not only smaller Q\n\nS\n but with also smaller Q\n\nP\n\/Q\n\nS\n and therefore a subsequent complexity on the a priori Q\n\nP\n\/Q\n\nS\n ratio as well as frequency dependency (see Aki, 1997 for an overview of the impacts of scattering on the quality factor). Based on the uncertainties on the Q\n\nP\n\/Q\n\nS\n ratio for short period waves, we therefore limit our analysis to the long period side and keep the Q\n\nP\n\n\u221d9\/4\u00b7\nQ\n\nS\n ratio.\nThus, we invert the quality factor in a waveform fitting process. For that, we explore both new quality factors Q\n\nP\n for P-wave on the Z (PZ) and R (PR) components, and Q\n\nS\n for S-wave on the Z (SZ) and T (ST) components. Exploration is made for Q\n\nS\n ranging from 160 and 670 with step of 25 (equivalent to Q\n\nP\n ranging from 360 to 1500, with step of 57). It includes the effective Q\n\u223c300 proposed by Giardini et al (2020) for LF events at distances ranging from 25 to 45\u2218 as well as Mars a priori Q\n\n\u03bc\n (Smrekar et al, 2018; Lognonn\u00e9 and Mosser, 1993).\nTo perform the attenuation correction, the spectra of the synthetic body wave timeseries are calculated over a window starting on the arrival times computed by the TauP toolkit (Crotwell et al, 1999) and with a duration of \u00b120 seconds around the phase in order to minimize Gibbs effects. The original synthetic spectrum S\n0(\u03c9) is thus corrected with a \u03c9\n2 source (Aki, 1980) and attenuation terms as:\n\n(1)\n\nS\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n=\n\n\n\nS\n0\n\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\u03c9\nc\n\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nexp\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c9\nT\n\n2\n\n(\n\n1\nQ\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\n\nQ\n0\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03c9\n\nc\n are the angular frequency and cutoff frequency respectively, and T is the wave propagation time.

(1), for each Q\n\nP\n\n\u2212\nQ\n\nS\n, we explore the seismic moment M\n0 and the phase shift. We determine the phase shift between the synthetic and the observed signal computed on a window of \u00b1 1.5 seconds centered on the maximum of the observed body wave. Thus, we allow the phase exploration over one wavelength around the maximum of amplitude. We define \u03c4\n\np\n and \u03c4\n\ns\n as the delays on the P- and the S-waves respectively.\nWe invert the body waveforms by computing the following variance function \u03b7 between synthetics and observed data on the 4 components:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\u0394\n\nT\np\n\n\n\ndt\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\nPZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nobs\nPZ\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\n\nQ\nP\n\n\nPZ\n\n\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\np\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\nPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nobs\nPR\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\n\nQ\nP\n\n\nPR\n\n\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\np\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u222b\n\n\u0394\n\nT\ns\n\n\n\ndt\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\nSZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nobs\nSZ\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\n\nQ\nZ\n\n\nSZ\n\n\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\nST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nobs\nST\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\n\nQ\nZ\n\n\nST\n\n\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\nQ\n\nC\n\n is the inverse Fourier transform of S for the direction C (Eq.

The duration of the windows are of 10 seconds, as a compromise between stability and the need to avoid contamination by later secondary phases as much as possible. In our approach, the \u03b5 weights have been chosen empirically to ensure a balance between quality of the fits and solutions stability at every depth (see the Section 5.1 for the final weighting values). According to our tests the PZ and ST synthetics are less sensitive to the model structure and consequently have an higher \u03b5.\n\n\n4.3.2\nSecondary phase amplitudes\nOn the basis of the rescaled synthetics described above, we compute the amplitude ratios between synthetic secondary phases and direct body waves, and compare the value with the observed signals. Using Q\n\nP\n and Q\n\nS\n factors is likely a significant approximation as the PP, PPP, SS and SSS rays are not propagating at the same depths as the P and S-wave. We exclusively focus on the maximum amplitudes of the Z component of PP, SS, PPP and SSS, and their associated P and S maximums (i.e. PP over P, PPP over P, SS over S and SSS over S).\nFor example in the case of the secondary phase PP, the maximum amplitude ratio is calculated as:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\nAmp\nPP\n\n=\n\n\nmax\n(\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nPP\n\n)\n\n\nmax\n(\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nP\n\n)\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere d\nPP and d\nP correspond to the observed or synthetic time series on a 5-seconds window for PP and P phases, respectively.\nThe observed secondary arrival times are compiled in Khan et al (2021) and Drilleau et al (2022), summed up in Table 2 and computed with TauP toolkit (Crotwell et al, 1999) on synthetics.\n\n\n\n4.4\nTotal cost function: solution selection\nWe select the best moment tensor solutions based on the lowest cost function value, which is the sum of eight separate terms; four terms on body wave fits of PZ, PR, SZ and ST, and four terms on secondary phase amplitude comparisons of PP, SS, PPP and SSS.\nThe synthetic body waves result from Section 4.3.1 computations, for each set of Q, M\n0, \u03c4 and MT geometry. The body wave cost function \u03c7 is calculated with a root mean square (RMS) difference evaluation on the body waveforms for each body wave component:\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c7\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\ni\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nsyn\n\n(\ni\n)\n\u2212\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nobs\n\n(\ni\n)\n)\n\n2\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03c7 is computed at each point i over a 10 seconds window and N corresponds to the number of points (200).\nFrom secondary amplitude computation in Section 4.3.2, we then compute the RMS difference \u03ba between observed amplitudes and synthetic amplitudes with the equation:\n\n(8)\n\n\u03ba\n=\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nAmp\nsyn\n\n\u2212\n\nAmp\nobs\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nThe terms Ampsyn and Ampobs account for maximum amplitude ratios of synthetics and observed data respectively (Eq. (6)).\nTherefore, the total cost function \u03a6 is the sum between \u03c7 (Eq. (7)) and \u03ba (Eq. (8)). We weight each cost function terms with weights \u03b1 and \u03b2 and the sum of the total weight is 1, i.e. \u03b1\n+\n\u03b2\n=1:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\n\u03a6\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\u00b7\n(\n\n\u03c7\nPZ\n\n+\n\n\u03c7\nPR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c7\nSZ\n\n+\n\n\u03c7\nST\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n\u00b7\n(\n\n\u03ba\n\nPP\n\/\nP\n\n\n+\n\n\u03ba\n\nSS\n\/\nS\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u03ba\n\nPPP\n\/\nP\n\n\n+\n\n\u03ba\n\nSSS\n\/\nS\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA final constrain is applied to choose the best solutions. As there is a lack of clear surface wave observations in the InSight data, we are looking for solutions where the synthetic surface waves are weaker than the current observed data level.\nIn this end, we evaluate the ratio \u03b3 of the quadratic mean between the synthetic surface waves and the Martian noise, and of the observed surface waves, with the following equation:\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b3\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSW\nsyn\n2\n\n+\n\nSN\nobs\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSW\nobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nSW corresponds to the spectra over the surface wave windows and SN is the spectrum of the data noise. The spectra are calculated on the Z component and filtered between 15 and 50 seconds (0.02\u20130.067Hz). The surface waves window starts 100 seconds after the S-wave and last 90 seconds for both synthetic and data. The noise signal is selected in the 5-minutes window prior to the arrival of the P-wave from the MQS pick (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021) and over a 90 seconds window. The solutions with \u03b3 ratios superior to 1 are rejected.\nNote that once the total inversion process is completed for one event, we perform a secondary inversion. The evaluation of the source term in Eq. (1) is adjusted, where we implement the refined cutoff frequencies (Eq. (2)) calculated with the best M\n0 (from Eq. (5)).\n\n\n\n5\nInversion results\nIn this section we present the inversion results for the nine marsquakes. We first describe the inversion parametrization. We then show the S0235b results in a more detailed way in order to represent the complete computation for a single quake. Then, we summarize the results found for the whole dataset and we detail the preferred solutions per event. The complete overviews of the results for all the seismic events, from S0173a to S0820a, are described in Supplementary materials.\n\n5.1\nInversion parametrization\nIn order to validate our method and its parameterization, we invert a terrestrial earthquake in a context comparable to the Martian conditions of InSight (intraplate earthquake, addition of Martian noise, velocity model of Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), located at 1600km epicentral distance on a 25km thick crust). The resulting moment tensors with our single-station approach are in strong good agreement with the USGS (Guy et al, 2015) and the GFZ (Quinteros et al, 2021) inversions. The details of this inversion and the results of this test are available in Supplementary material S9. Besides, we also compute two sensitivity tests on the S0235b event; the sensitivity to the BAZ of the event (Supplementary material S10) and the dependency towards the velocity model (Supplementary material S11).\nWe have chosen the inversion weights according to the best compromise on the ratio of the weights in the variance \u03b7 (\u03b5 in Eq. (4)) and in the total cost function (\u03b1 and \u03b2 values in Eq. (9)). For \u03b5 weights, we observe that the ratio of 0.4 on PZ and ST and 0.1 on PR and SZ is the most appropriate in order to obtain good fits on the maximum number of components as well as better solution stability. A ratio of \u03b1 = 0.7 on the body waves and \u03b2 = 0.3 on the secondary phases is retained to account for the discrepancy in the number of points between body wave terms and secondary phases.\nFurthermore, we make two cost function analyses (Eq. (9)) for all the marsquakes in order to investigate the stability of solutions at higher depths. Thus, we separate; i) \u03a61 as the full cost function results (\u03b1\n=0.7, \u03b2\n=0.3), which encompasses the four body wave terms (PZ, PR, SZ and ST) and the four secondary phase terms of (PP, SS, PPP and SSS); ii) \u03a62 as the partial cost function, including the four body wave terms (PZ, PR, SZ and ST) and only the two secondary phase terms of PP and SS. This partial cost function \u03a62 is mainly used to explore deeper solutions as PPP and SSS are limited to \u223c 40km depths.\n\n\n5.2\nS0235b event results\nThe 20 best body wave fits at each depth (over a total of 32000 solutions at each depth, between 12 and 57km) are represented on Fig. 3\na for the case of \u03a61 cost function terms, and on Fig. 4\na for the case of \u03a62 terms. In these Figures, we calculate the body wave fits on the 10 seconds window on PZ, PR, SZ and ST components. We also display the associated misfits for each component, normalized separately between 0 and 1. We observe that the main energy peak is well retrieved on the four body wave components. Notably ST is very well constrained and has small and very stable misfits, although the first five seconds of signal are not retrieved in the calculation and the fits focus more on the main wavelength occurring after 5 seconds. This is explained by the fact that the maximum of the observed ST amplitude is located at about 5 seconds after the arrival of the S-wave, despite the first oscillation at \u223c 2 seconds. The synthetics are therefore rephased (from \u03c4\n\np\n and \u03c4\n\ns\n, see Section 4.3.1) according to this maximum and ignore the first seconds of signal. Since we rephase all components of the S-wave with the same phase, the early signal is also ignored on SZ. Concerning the SZ component, the maximum pulse at 6 seconds is not well estimated for between 12 and 24km depths. On the other hand in the case of the P-wave, the last 5 seconds of the signal are slightly underestimated for PZ and the main peak is well estimated. PR is very well retrieved at all depths except at 12km depth for \u03a61 evaluation.\nIn addition to these Figures, the observations on the body waveform fits for the 4 components are consistent with the body wave spectra (on Figs. 3b and 4b). PZ, PR and ST components are well retrieved and in agreement with the data for both amplitudes and spectral shape. The SZ spectra are the least resolved, as the general shape of the spectra is shifted towards the high frequencies compared to the data and is strongly underestimated. As observed in the time domain of Figs. 3a and 4a, the SZ shallow depth solutions are the worst, with more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of the observed data. This is certainly explained by the weaker evaluation and the bad phase shift of the SZ waveforms in the first 5 seconds.\nThe synthetic surface wave spectra on the right panel of Figs. 3c and 4c are much weaker by about one order of magnitude than the Martian noise at all depths.\nWe represent the secondary phase amplitude results on Figs. 3d and 4d. On these, PP, SS, PPP and SSS timeseries are presented on a 11-seconds time window, where we add 3 seconds of signal (gray areas) before and after the effective secondary phase window. We display the normalized misfits on the right panels. The synthetic and observed waveforms are shifted according to their maximums (green dashed line) for better readability. From TauP computations, in the case of S0235b, the synthetic secondary phases PPP and SSS are not detected below 37km (\u03a61 case), and SS are absent below 59km (\u03a62 case). The secondary phase maximums are overally well retrieved at all depths and similar between \u03a61 and \u03a62 analyses. Especially, PP and PPP display small and stable misfits. SS and SSS are slightly less constrained. SS stabilizes below 24km depth in both \u03a61 and \u03a62 cases. SSS is overestimated at 12 and 18km depths.\nWe then visualize the magnitude \n\nM\nw\n\n and quality factors Q\n\nP\n for the P-wave and Q\n\nS\n for the S-wave on Fig. 4e. The \n\nM\nw\n\n and Q values globally are very similar between \u03a61 and \u03a62. The crustal \n\nM\nw\n\n tends to 2.9. Below 30km, the \n\nM\nw\n\n is very stable and tends to 3.2. Our \n\nM\nw\n\n values are in agreement with those computed in Brinkman et al. (2021) (value of 3.1, in pink dashed line), but underestimated compared to the MQS with values of 3.6 \u00b1 0.2 (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021).\nThe mean Q evaluation is oscillating from 12 to 57km depth between \u223c 500 and 1000 (corresponding to Q\n\nS\n values of 300\u2013600) and are certainly related to the mean Q step of \u223c40. The general shapes of the spectra on Figs. 3b and 4b are also affected by the attenuation value, which impacts the slope of the spectra. The higher the attenuation (i.e. Q is small), the flatter the spectrum is at high frequencies and the higher is the M\n0 to compensate. In the case of S0235b, the 3 component spectra of PZ, PR and ST are quite reliable to the data, and thus we can expect that the attenuation is rather well estimated. Indeed it is coherent with Brinkman et al. (2021) values of \u223c 500, despite being overestimated compared to Giardini et al (2020) evaluation of 320.\nOn Fig. 5\n, we display the best moment tensor solutions for S0235b. On the top, we represent the moment tensor beachballs in a probabilistic formalism with a probability density function (PDF), where we superpose the 20 best solutions on top of each other. On the bottom, the total normalized misfits (equivalent to \u03a61 and \u03a62) are the sums of the different terms (body wave fits and secondary phase amplitudes). The focal mechanisms for S0235b are stable at each depth and also from one depth to another, below 30km. A normal faulting regime is pretty well constrained from 12 to 57km (with mixed strike-slip components at crustal depths), and strike and dip are constant with mean values of 80\u2218 (300\u2218 second nodal plane) and 65\u2218(50\u2218) respectively. Moment tensor results between the two cost function analyses are also very similar. In fact, we note that the moment tensors are a bit unstable in the crust either on the strike or the rake components (as observed on the body wave fits on top of Figs. 3a and 4a. These instabilities are certainly due to the temporal proximity of the depth phases (pP, sS) with the main peak of the body waves in the 20 first kilometers, as already evoked in Brinkman et al. (2021). It might also be explained by the close velocity model discontinuity at 10km and at 24km with the Moho (from Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Knapmeyer-Endrun et al, 2021).\n\n\n5.3\nResults summary\nAccording to all our results (detailed in the Supplementary materials S1 to S8 for the complete dataset):\n\n\u2022\nThe body waveforms are better constrained on the PZ, PR and ST components, while SZ is difficult to estimate in several cases (e.g., S0235b, S0484b, S0820a, as well as in Brinkman et al. (2021) results on S0173a and S0235b). In fact, the SZ components are contaminated by larger converted receiver phases which do not facilitate the calculations.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe secondary phases are well estimated on PP, SS and SSS, whereas PPP is frequently very weak in amplitude compared to the data for multiple events (e.g. S0407a, S0784a, S0809a). This can be partially attributed to the difficulty of observing PPP in a very small frequency band (Khan et al, 2021; Drilleau et al, 2022), but this also applies to PP identification, which are on the contrary better constrained in our computations.\n\n\n\u2022\nMagnitudes are stable in general, recurrently much smaller than those found by the MQS by about 0.5 (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021 and Table 1), but in agreement with the values of Brinkman et al. (2021) for events S0173a and S0235b. This discrepancy is not fully understood at this time.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn parallel, the Q factor is rather constrained overall. Still, it can converge to the limit values and not stabilize in depth (e.g. S0325a, S0409d, S0784a, S0809a). In this study, Q acts more as a tapering parameter on the spectral shapes and on the \n\nM\nw\n\n evaluations, and does not affect the global geometry of the moment tensor solutions.\n\n\n\u2022\nLastly, we find that synthetic surface waves are about one order of magnitude smaller than the observed data, and we have selected at least 90% of the global dataset solutions with surface wave amplitudes smaller than the InSight data (see S0235b spectra Figs. 3c and 4c. This implies that the Martian noise is high enough to exceed the synthetic surface waves even at 12km. In other words, this finding is very valuable, as it leads to the conclusion that shallow sources at about 12km depth are possible for all the inverted LF\/BB events, despite the fact that there are no clear surface waves in the InSight data.\n\n\n\nWe represent the best moment tensor solutions for every marsquakes at each depth on Fig. 6\n for \u03a61 cost function and on Fig. 7\n for \u03a62 cost function. The majority of \u03a61 solutions have slightly better stability than those of \u03a62 on the same depths, and overall the tensors are in very good agreement between the two cost functions. Similarly to S0235b (Section 5.2) the crustal solutions between 12 and 21km are frequently unstable with a succession of minimum-maximum misfit values (e.g. 18km deep solution of S0173a on Figs. 6 and 7, and in Supplementary material S1). On these Figures, the six events S0173a (detailed in Supplementary material S1), S0235b (Section 5.2), S0409d (Supplementary material S4), S0484b (Supplementary material S5), S0809a (Supplementary material S7) and S0820a (Supplementary material S8) are characterized by normal faulting mechanisms at a majority of depths. S0325a (Supplementary material S2), S0407a (Supplementary material S3) and S0784a (Supplementary material S6) converge to a reverse mechanism. The S0409d, S0484b, S0784a and S0809a beachballs are unstable on several DC components along the depth. In addition, these events are the least resolved at each depth, meaning that multiple solutions resolve the data. The resulting PDFs are not as concentrated as those of the other seven marsquakes.\n\n\n5.4\nBest source solutions\nOn both result Figs. 6 and 7, there is no trend of a minimum misfit for the entire set of events, with one depth standing out. The previous work on Martian moment tensor presented by Brinkman et al. (2021) for events S0173a and S0235b (and S0183a) agrees on depths on the order of 33\u201340km. Also, Drilleau et al (2022) find source depths of 20-35\u00b110km for all the events (except S0820a which is not analyzed in their study), based on depth phase observations. Moreover, the synthetic secondary phases PPP and SSS identified in the data are calculated with the TauP toolkit (Crotwell et al, 1999) on the synthetics up to 40km depth.\nFrom these, in order to remain consistent with data and recent results, we assume that the seismic sources are located at depths between 10 and 40km. We propose to select two \u03a61 solutions for each event; one in the crust between 12 and 24km and the other under the equivalent Martian Moho of the velocity model, between 24km and until the shadow zone depth of synthetic PPP-SSS of about 40km depth. We choose the sets of solutions based on the misfit minimums on \u03a61, and the moment tensor solutions must be similar between \u03a61 and \u03a62.\nWe display on Fig. 8\n the two selected moment tensor solutions for each quake (also highlighted with blue and orange lines on Fig. 6). The figure is separated into two topographic maps gathering the large surface structures of the study area (Knapmeyer et al., 2006); on the left panel we represent the crustal solutions between 12 and 24km deep, and on the right panel we show the solutions between 24 and 39km deep. Each moment tensor solution is located at the epicenter of the event, i.e. at the center of the ellipsoid (visible on Fig. 1). In parallel, the Table 3\n summarizes the set of output parameters associated with each solution, specifying the type of the dominant focal mechanism, the depth of the source, the three angles of the strike, dip, and rake, and the calculated magnitude \n\nM\nw\n\n and attenuation factors of Q\n\nP\n and Q\n\nS\n.\nAnalyzing the selected solutions on both Fig. 8 and Table 3, we first observe that S0173a, S0235b and S0820a marsquakes are in the normal dominant regime (mixed with strike-slip components for S0409d and S0484b), on the other hand, S0325a, S0407a and S0784a display clear reverse regime. Lastly, the dominant regime of S0809a is not obvious because its rake is unstable, either reverse in the crust, or normal at higher depths.\nThe majority of the selected sources are located at 18 and 30km depths. The depth values of our results for S0173a, S0235b, S0325a, S0409d, S0484b and S0809a are very close to those obtained in Drilleau et al (2022) from pP and sS depth phase analyses. The S0173a solution at 36km depth and the S0235b\u2019 33km solution are very similar to the depths of \u223c 30\u201335km from Brinkman et al. (2021).\nEvents S0173a, S0235b, S0407a, S0484b and S0820a have stable and similar strike angles oriented towards E-W\/NW-SE. The thrust fault mechanisms of S0325a, S0407a and S0784a are also oriented E-W globally, but with less similarities between them as they are not located in the same area.\nThe dip angle is remarkably similar for the nine marsquakes, with high values of 70\u201380\u2218 on their first nodal plane. Excepted in the cases of S0235b and S0484b, the dip angles are asymmetrical between the first and the auxiliary nodal planes, the second plane being much less inclined (values approximately between 10 and 40\u2218).\nThe rake angle varies significantly between events, with values ranging from \u221276\u2218 (S0173a) to \u2212115\u2218 (S0820a) for normal events, and from 67\u2218 (S0784a) to 132\u2218 (S0784a) for reverse ones. S0809a is peculiar and its rake at 15km depth is mixed between right-strike-slip and thrust motion, while it is more clearly converging towards normal motion at 30km depth.\nThe magnitude ranges between 2.17 (S0409d) and 3.24 (S0325a) with a majority of values around \u223c 2.7. For all the events, the magnitude increases by about 0.2 at depth. The values are much lower than the MQS estimates including errors (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021 and Table 1) to within 0.5, especially S0409d magnitude values which are more than 0.8 weaker than the MQS \n\nM\nw\n\n values of 3.2 \u00b1 0.2. Besides, the \n\nM\nw\n\n of 2.92-3.21 of S0173a and S0235b are very close to the estimates of 3.0 and 3.1 respectively calculated by Brinkman et al. (2021).\nFinally, the best solution quality factors Q\n\nP\n and Q\n\nS\n are not easily interpretable. Still, from our results, we observe the Q\n\nS\n factor being mainly between \u223c350 and 500 (Q\n\nP\n between \u223c800 and 1200), overestimated compared to the values from Giardini et al (2020), where the Q\n\nS\n is of 300\u2013320 for S0173a, S0235b and S0325a, but in agreement with the values imposed in Brinkman et al. (2021). The solutions of Q\n\nS\n for S0235b and S0325a (30km solution) are in good agreement with their study, as well as S0407a, S0484b (27km solution), S0809a (15km solution) and S0820a. The Q of S0173a is unconstrained and tends towards higher boundary at the two selected depths. Moreover, the values of Q can affect the \n\nM\nw\n\n estimates, i.e. large Q factors result in underestimation of \n\nM\nw\n\n.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussions\nWe have selected two moment tensor solutions for the nine inverted marsquakes. In this section, the solutions are interpreted in relation to the structures and the geological context of the region. We first highlight the different uncertainties and limitations of our inversion approach. Then we describe the generic structures of interest in the area. Finally, we make a more precise analysis on regions close to the epicenters, thus exploring several possibilities on the origin of the marsquakes.\n\n6.1\nInversion limitations\nIn this study, we face difficulties coming from the numerous uncertainties and unknowns on Mars and due to the quality of data (single seismic station framework).\nFrom the velocity model used to compute synthetic seismograms, we made the hypothesis that the crustal structure defined for the vicinity of the InSight station, recovered in Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021) from receiver function and auto-correlation approaches, is the same at the nine epicenters, which are situated 1000\u20132000km away. In the same way, the 1D structure assumption implies that there is no lateral velocity (or density) heterogeneities and no variations of the Martian Moho depth (e.g. 24km in the used model versus 35\u201340km in the Cerberus region, from Parro et al, 2017 or Plesa et al, 2018). This inference is even more problematic for the event S0325a located on the Martian dichotomy. To address this issue, we invert an earthquake located in Australia with Martian synthetics (see Supplementary material S9) to show the non-dependence of the geometry of the moment tensors with the internal model. We also invert S0235b with the secondary crustal model from Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), with a 3rd layer at 43km (in Supplementary material S11). The moment tensor solutions of the Australian earthquake are very consistent with those calculated by the USGS (Guy et al, 2015) and the GFZ (Quinteros et al, 2021), and show good stability at depth. However, the magnitude (too small) and the quality factors (too high) are unconstrained due to their dependencies towards the velocity model. At the same time, the moment tensor results of the S0235b sensitivity test with 3-layered TAYAK model are quite similar to those of the 2-layered model (results in Section 5.2) but are less clearly extensive and are less stable over the full depth ranges. An accurate 3D model (that are recently being proposed, for example in Plesa et al., 2021) associated with 3D synthetics, or failing that, a model at the source location, would account better for the complexity of the internal structure.\nWe also have uncertainties on the localization of the marsquakes (distance and BAZ). Currently, the distance of the marsquakes is known to within approximately 5\u2218 (\u223c 300km) uncertainties. In our methodology, we select separately the seismic phase windows, hence we can get rid of their relative arrival times controlled by the epicentral distance. Although, the synthetic amplitudes are directly dependent of the distance, and directly linked to the \n\nM\nw\n\n and Q evaluations. Moreover, the sensitivity test on the BAZ (Supplementary material S10) demonstrates good stability overall. Yet, we note some differences in the moment tensor dip angles, with those of the nominal inversion of S0235b (in Section 5.2).\nIn addition, the uncertainty about the Martian structure is not only limited to layer geometry and heterogeneities but also to key parameters such as the attenuation (or 1\/Q). It controls the marsquake frequency content and the signal amplitude, and it is still not well understood and estimated for Mars. That is why in our approach it is one of the explored parameters, mainly used to adjust the fits of the body waves. But we are not able to find an emerging value for the nine marsquakes, and for instance in the case of S0325a (Supplementary material S2), the Q exploration tends towards the upper boundary. Its refinement would certainly allow to obtain optimal fits and a better estimate of the moment magnitude, as well as stress drop and fault size scales.\nFinally, regarding the seismo-tectonic analyses that we make below, we are on a fairly well covered area both by satellite imagery and by scientific studies of recent years. However many structures are still poorly observed (for instance Al Qahira Vallis and Avernus Dorsa, see Figs. 1 and 9\n and Section 6 below), and we lack field data to refine the remote morphological observations. A closer temporal monitoring between images of the same area (on the order of a day) would be also very useful to detect surface movements,e.g. landslides or boulders possibly related to the seismicity.\nHowever, despite these difficulties, we have several studies that converge on the same results, using different approaches. Moreover, we are fortunate to have sufficiently high resolution images to look at the main structures. We are thus able to link our results to satellite observations.\n\n\n6.2\nSeismogenic sources\nThe most visible structures of the central Elysium Planitia region are fractures and faults, ranging from a few tens of kilometers to several hundred kilometers long. On all of our maps (Figs. 1 and 8) from Knapmeyer et al. (2006) data, two main modes of deformation are observed, extension (red lines) which is dominant in the region, and compression (black lines).\nNotable extensional structures near the marsquakes are: the Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles systems, Elysium Fossae further north and Al Qahira Vallis at the dichotomy (Fig. 1). Cerberus fossae is suggested to have had tectonic activity as recently as 10Ma (Vaucher et al, 2009; Taylor et al, 2013), and of a few Ma for Grjot\u00e1 Valles (Hartmann and Neukum, 2001). Elysium Fossae activity is thought to be older, estimated at 200\u2013500Ma (Vaucher et al, 2009). Al Qahira Vallis is an ancient valley with several hundred million years of activity, between the last 2 Ga and 700Ma ago (Cabrol et al, 1998).\nThe largest observed compressive structure in our area is located at Tartarus Montes. It is a large ridge whose formation predates that of Grjot\u00e1 Valles (Hamilton et al, 2010). All other compressive features of the region are of more moderate size and are mostly wrinkle ridges (for example, black lines in Avernus Dorsa). The wrinkle ridges are the result of lithospheric flexure and located at the apex of reverse faults at depth (Banerdt et al, 1982; Head et al, 2002).\n\n\n6.3\nCerberus fossae: a major fracture zone in Elysium Planitia\nIn the study area on Figs. 1 and 8, Cerberus fossae is the largest structure, and is associated with the Grjot\u00e1 Valles system further north. These two sub-parallel fracture zones are trending N100-110\u2218E. They are good candidates as the source of the seismic events, suggesting an ongoing localized activity on Mars. From our results on Fig. 8 and Table 3, the seismic events S0173a, S0235b, S0409d, S0484b, S0809a and S0820a are associated to extensional moment tensors compatible with Cerberus extensive motion, while S0407a depicts reverse tensors and S0809a is both reverse (crust) and normal (deeper). Given the locations and diversity of the focal mechanism solutions, it is more likely that there are multiple seismic sources generating the seven marsquakes.\nIn more detail, the recent tectonic activity in this region could result from several processes involving thermal contraction and\/or indirect volcanism. Recent volcanism in the last million years in the center parts of Cerberus fossae has been proposed by Horvath et al (2021) as recent as 50ka. Moreover, some small amplitude and long duration LF events located on Cerberus fossae have been suggested as potential slow seismic events by Kedar et al. (2021). The existence of these slow marsquakes could imply that a seismic source by volcanism exists in Elysium Planitia. More recently, small events possibly associated with S0173a and S0235b have been proposed to be related to volcanic activity in the upper mantle by Sun and Tkal\u010di\u0107 (2022). There is no direct evidence from gravimetric data that a mantle plume lies beneath Elysium Mons, whereas, a positive Bouguer anomaly of 100mGal (about \u2212100mGal on the surrounding terrains) is visible near Avernus Dorsa (Genova et al, 2016, and see Figure in Supplementary material S12), possibly testifying to a less dense crustal mass, for example of magmatic origin. Besides, the infrared imagery from THEMIS data (Fergason et al, 2006) does not show localized hotspots along Cerberus Fossae faults, suggesting that there is currently little or no thermal anomaly related to a surficial magmatic flow. Thus, a shallow magmatic source is unlikely, but it is possible that a magma flow at depths exists (Kedar et al., 2021; Sun and Tkal\u010di\u0107, 2022).\nOn the other hand, the seismicity could rather be related to ancient dike networks at depth (\u2248 5\u201320km), as it is expected that they are radially distributed around the Elysium Mons volcano (Ernst et al, 2001). Despite the fact that Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles are located more than 1000km east of the volcano, Ernst et al (2001) concluded on networks that may extend over distances of the order of more than 2000km. Thus, these massive dikes are suggested to propagate under Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles systems, and are likely responsible for the graben subsidence (Vetterlein and Roberts, 2010; Taylor et al, 2013; Perrin et al, 2022). Rivas-Dorado et al (2021) analyzed the graben widths, lengths and topographic data, and inferred the relationships between dike depths and graben widths.They estimate that dikes can expand to depths from 5 \u2013 20km in the case of Elysium Fossae. We assume a similar configuration on the dike depths for Cerberus Fossae, as the graben widths are comparable with those of Elysium Fossae (Taylor et al, 2013; Perrin et al, 2022). The formation and propagation of dikes in depth is thus likely related to mechanical weakness and the creation\/reactivation of adjacent sub-parallel fractures. It is therefore proposed that buried fractures exist below the graben systems, in the same geometry. In addition, the dip angles of the seven marsquakes are of the order of 60 to 80\u2218 (Table 1), thus sub-vertical, and more consistent with underlying extensional fractures. We also find most of our best moment tensor solutions around 18km deep for all of the inverted masquakes (Fig. 8). Although these depths are on the same scale as the lower dike tips at 20km of Rivas-Dorado et al (2021), it is unclear to relate our results directly to the movements generated by the grabens located at the top of the dikes, on the first kilometers. We note that S0173a, S0409d, S0809a and S0820a are well aligned together (mainly NW-SE oriented) and very close to the general direction of the Cerberus fossae grabens. Thus, we suppose that these marsquakes are indirectly associated to the Cerberus fossae tectonics, and instead originated from the reactivation of deep extensive fractures, resulting from dike emplacement. In the case of S0809a at 15 km depth, the moment tensor solution has mixed components of reverse and strike-slip while having comparable strike and dip angles with the 30 km deep solution. Therefore, to explain this, we suppose that a network of compressive fractures also exists, and accommodates the mainly extensive deformation of the dikes. But alternatively, the solutions may simply be unresolved, knowing that the crustal mechanisms of S0809a are otherwise not very stable (see Fig. 6 and Supplementary S7), in which case the extensive solution at 30 km depth would be favored.\nFrom the mapping of Knapmeyer et al. (2006) (Figs. 1 and 8), there are no major compressive structures recorded at the ellipsoid of S0407a, and very few in the vicinity of Cerberus fossae fractures. The 18km solution (NE-SW, with a small dip angle) is not obviously coherent with Cerberus fossae configuration, while the 36km depth solution is in strong agreement with the system geometry (on both strike and dip angles). We thus propose that S0407a could be generated by buried thrust faults sub-parallel to Cerberus fossae. It is also possible that, given the location and tensor geometry of this event, it could be a reactivation by thermal contraction of the Cerberus fossae faults in reverse regime.\nTo the same extent, S0235b and S0484b are consistent with the geometry and tectonic activity of Cerberus fossae. Although, their epicenters are not located on Cerberus fossae, but are closer to the Grjot\u00e1 Valles system. Thus, we can not clearly rule out one or the other system as a source for these marsquakes (see discussions in Section 6.4.1 below).\n\n\n6.4\nAnalyses of other nearby seismic sources\nEven though Cerberus fossae is clearly the largest structure in the region shown in Fig. 8, the nine seismic events are not all located on the fractures and\/or their solutions are not all compatible with the graben geometry. In addition, the ellipsoids are the representations of the probability of the location of marsquakes with the epicenter being the highest probability, but the areas covered are broad (about 60,000\u2013200,000km2 per event) and include several other major and moderate structures (as seen on Fig. 1). The sensitivity test results on the BAZ in Supplementary S11 demonstrate the robustness of the moment tensor solutions. Hence, we explore the remarkable structural features covered by the ellipsoids and investigate the possible other scenarios that would explain the source of the most distant marsquakes.\nFor this reason, we regroup on Fig. 9 three areas of interest of four marsquakes (see also insets referenced in Fig. 8), with their associated best moment tensor solutions and ellipsoid imprints: the S0235b and S0484b events along the Grjot\u00e1 Valles (Fig. 9a and detailed in Section 6.4.1), the S0784a event along the Avernus Dorsa wrinkles (Fig. 9b and Section 6.4.2), and the S0325a event at the dichotomy (Fig. 9c and Section 6.4.3).\n\n6.4.1\nS0235b and S0484b: Grjot\u00e1 Valles and Tartarus Montes region\nIn the cases of S0484b and S0235b, the ellipsoids are centered mainly on the Grjot\u00e1 Valles system, north of Cerberus fossae (Figs. 1 and 9a). The Grjot\u00e1 Valles grabens (shown in thick red lines) are proposed to be contemporary with the Cerberus fossae fractures (Vaucher et al, 2009; Brown and Roberts, 2019) because they intersect the same lava plains and flow channels. The system of Grjot\u00e1 Valles has the same general orientation of N110\u2218E and is radially oriented with respect to Elysium Mons. Thus, the Grjot\u00e1 Valles and Cerberus fossae grabens most likely originate from the same processes, i.e. they would be the surface expression of underlying dikes (Ernst et al, 2001; Brown and Roberts, 2019). In addition, the fractures intersect knobby terrains of the Noachian-early Hesperian (4.1-3.5 Ga, Hartmann and Neukum, 2001; Plescia, 2003; Vaucher et al, 2009) of the Tartarus Montes formation. Despite unlikely recent activity (Hamilton et al, 2010), the major compressive Tartarus volcanic ridge (solid black lines trending N60\u2218E on Fig. 9a, has certainly enabled shallow fracturation in the region. We also observe a few minor N-S trending compressive structures of 20\u201350km long that could be reactivated (thin black lines).\nGiven the normal fault solutions of the moment tensors selected for S0235b-S0484b (Fig. 8), we favor a seismic source located on either one of the Cerberus or Grjot\u00e1 grabens. Especially, the S0235b strike angles of \u223c300\u2218 and of \u223c110\u2218 for S0484b solutions match very well with the overall graben directions of the two regions. As developed before in the case of Cerberus Fossae events, the seismic sources are more probably linked to internal weakening, oriented and aligned with Grjot\u00e1 fractures, and without clear surficial imprints. The retained depths of S0235b are slightly higher than those of S0484b (33 and 27km respectively) as well as the higher value of \n\nM\nw\n\n of 2.9-3.2 versus 2.4-2.6 respectively. These inferences suggest that S0235b is associated with a larger and deeper structure than S0484b. Besides, the depths of these two events are too high to be related to a dike, but are more consistent with deep fractures or faults. This is also supported by their large dip angles of 60\u2212\u221270\u2218, coherent with sub-vertical buried fractures. The lower dip angles of S0235b and S0484b (49\u201363\u2218) at 33\u201327km depth respectively, might suggest that the faults become slightly more listric at depth. We also note that the 21km deep focal mechanism of S0484b has a large strike-slip component, which could imply an interaction between the extensional component at Grjot\u00e1 Valles and the transpressive inherited NE-SW structures at Tartarus Montes (Fig. 9a). But this hypothesis would need further work, i.e. detailed observations on the morphology and geology of the area, to understand such complex interactions.\nFurther north of the S0484b ellipsoid (on top of Fig. 1), the Elysium Fossae graben is unconsidered as a primary seismic source due to an activity dated anterior to 200Ma at most (Vaucher et al, 2009) and due to its location. In addition, we do not observe any particular extensive structure crossing the lava plains at the southern end of the S0484b ellipsoid (shared with the upper part of the S0784a ellipsoid, see the discussion below and Fig. 9b).\n\n\n6.4.2\nS0784a: Avernus dorsa ridges\nThe northern part of the S0784a ellipsoid (observable on the upper part of the Fig. 9b) is located on a broad volcanic plain of Elysium Planitia composed of Late Amazonian lavas (several hundreds of ka, Tanaka et al, 2011). On the mapping of Knapmeyer et al. (2006) on Figs. 1 and 8, we do not notice any surface fractures in these plains. However, gravimetric analyses (Genova et al, 2016) of the area shows that a positive Bouguer anomaly (300mGal versus 0mGal in the surrounding terrains, see figure in Supplementary material S12) exists at the northern end of the ellipsoid of S0784a, indicating a potential excess of crustal mass of a size of about 100km which is not reflected in the topography. The mass excess is compatible with an upwelling of a denser mantle material, also compatible to a shallow dike activity, and supports a potential hidden activity below the lava deposits. But, even if the S0784a epicenter is located on these lava plains, the lack of information on a potential buried structure prevents us from favoring a source in these surroundings.\nIn addition, we observe a chaotic fracture network on the west outside of the event ellipsoid, mainly with moderate extensive fractures (red lines on Fig. 9b) of 10\u201350km long without any preferential orientation. These extensive fractures could be subjected to compressive reactivation by the planetary thermal contraction. The S0784a solutions may be compatible with the E-W orientation of these chaotic fractures, although they are too distant (\u223c 400km from epicenter) and principally extensive.\nBesides, in Fig. 9b we show the main structures of the southern part of the ellipsoid. In the center of the figure, we highlight the sub-parallel wrinkle ridges of Avernus Dorsa trending NNE-SSW and dated late Noachian-early Hesperian (about 3.5 Ga, Tanaka et al, 2011). As the generic Martian wrinkle ridges, they are associated to regional shortening, and from mixed process between the regional volcanic strains (Watters, 1993; Mangold et al, 2000) and the brittle lithosphere contrast between Martian highlands and lowlands (Frey et al, 2002).\nThe solutions we compute for S0784a marsquake are mainly reverse (Fig. 8 and Table 3). The two solutions at 15km and 33 depths are oriented E-W. Despite the fact that the reverse motion, the dip angles and depths of S0784a are in agreement with the wrinkle ridge geometries, the general E-W orientation of our two solutions is not in line with the NNE-SSW orientation of Avernus Dorsa traces. In contrast, S0784a is close to the dichotomy, and our solutions are oriented perpendicular to the southern highlands. At this transition zone, structures and cracks are also aligned with the dichotomy boundary, some of them are normal, and would have allowed the ancient subsidence of the lowlands (Maxwell and McGill, 1988; Smrekar et al, 2004). Thus, this deformation transmitted from the southern highlands in Terra Cimmeria to the northern lowlands of Elysium Planitia could have generated large crustal weaknesses and faulting (Frey et al, 2002; Golombek et al, 2018; Pan et al, 2020). It is therefore suspected that E-W oriented fractures, without surface expression, may exist in these deformed terrains. Thus, we propose that event S0784a may have been generated by a deep fault, parallel to the dichotomy and in a compressive regime, reactivated by the stresses associated with planetary contraction.\n\n\n6.4.3\nS0325a: The dichotomy region\nIn Fig. 9c, we identify the structures located in the center of the S0325a ellipsoid, within the cratered Terra Cimmeria terrains of Noachian age (about 4 Ga, Tanaka et al, 2011). The terrains are very old and cratered, and the wrinkle ridges present in the area intersect them. The relative chronology suggests that more recent activity is possible in this area, although highly uncertain and in the last 4 Ga.\nOn the northern end of the ellipsoid (Figs. 1 and 8) most of the deformation compiled by Knapmeyer et al. (2006) is extensional, and the fractures are weakly marked and of a few tens of kilometers long. The southern limit of the S0325a ellipsoid (Fig. 1) is adjacent to a small network of compressive fractures of variable orientations (note also that a large crack of about 50km in an extensive regime oriented NE-SW has been mapped close to the southern end of the S0325a ellipsoid on Fig. 1 and compiled in Knapmeyer et al. (2006), but we consider this trace as erratic, as it is not corresponding to any clear surface expression). The center of S0325a ellipsoid is located 100km east from a major structure, Al Qahira Vallis (Figs. 1 and 9c) which is an ancient valley oriented NNE-SSW. This structure is suggested to have been active between 700Ma-2 Ga ago (Cabrol et al, 1998) and related to regional catastrophic overflow of a paleolake (Irwin et al, 2004). The general orientation of Al Qahira Vallis is rather N\u2013S, but could be in agreement with the solutions of S0325a whose strike are of \u223c 20\u201340\u2218 (Table 3). Although, the moment tensors of S0325a are mostly reverse whereas Al Qahira is a graben structure. In addition, the valley is located too far from the ellipsoid to be directly involved in this event. However, it is possible that the extension of Al Qahira Vallis generated other adjacent fractures closer to the ellipsoid. But without more information we cannot relate this major structure to S0325a with confidence.\nOn the other hand, in the center area of Fig. 9c inside the ellipsoid, we observe several wrinkle ridges (and a few small extensive fractures) oriented NNE-SSW\/NE-SW and of the order of 50km in length. The thermal contraction is supposed to be the main process at the origin of these contractional features.\nThe two S0325a moment tensors solutions at 18 and 30km depths, are oriented NNE-SSW, with low to high dip angles (from 27\u201336\u2218 to 58\u201381\u2218) and depict a reverse regime (Figs. 8 and 9c), consistent with most of the compressive features of this area. The 18 and 30km solution depths are large, relative to the assumed depths of 1 to 10km of the thrust faults beneath the wrinkle ridges (Mangold et al, 1998; Schultz, 2000; Watters, 2004). But still, the geometry of wrinkle ridges is quite complex, and several studies actually mention crustal or lithospheric depths for wrinkle ridge fault rooting, depending on the brittle-ductile transition (Golombek et al, 2001; Mont\u00e9si and Zuber, 2003; Andrews-Hanna, 2020). Moreover, in Andrews-Hanna (2020), the tectonic modeling of wrinkle ridge morphology shows that additional faults are nucleated adjacent to the main blind thrust fault (dip angles of 20\u201370\u2218 up to 20km depth), which can be rooted to depths up to 30km beneath the ridges where it is listric (dip angles of 15\u201340\u2218). The solutions on the dips, rakes and depths of S0325a event, are then consistent with wrinkle ridge geometries. On the other hand, we consider that S0325a tensors are the least stable of our dataset, the two solutions are very different from each other, and that the crustal model does not include the heterogeneities of the dichotomy highlands. In order to properly account for these limitations, we conclude that S0325a was generated by a reverse fault at depth reactivated by thermal contraction, and the fault could either be located under a wrinkle ridge, or merely be the result of the large regional deformation without surface expression.\n\n\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nInSight single seismic station on Mars requires inversion approaches specifically adapted to Martian data. We have thus developed a method of inversion of seismic moment tensors and applied it for nine marsquakes, to identify the probable seismic sources at their origin. For this purpose, we inverted the waveforms of the body waves P and S, and the amplitudes of the secondary phases PP, SS, PPP and SSS. We also selected the solutions with weak synthetic surface waves, below the Martian noise level as they are not observed in the InSight data. The considered marsquakes are comparable to tectonic earthquakes and characterized by high SNR and magnitude values of \u223c3. In addition, they are all located in the Elysium Planitia region and a majority of them are located on the Cerberus fossae system (from both MQS estimations by InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021 and by Drilleau et al, 2022).\nThe depth of the InSight events is an uncertain parameter and the current estimated values are notably between about 20 and 50km (see Brinkman et al., 2021; Drilleau et al., 2022). Our results showed that it is possible to resolve the focal mechanisms in a stable manner along multiple depths for our entire dataset. In particular, we demonstrated for all events that there are the majority of the synthetic solutions that are compatible with the data surface wave amplitudes. More precisely, we found that the synthetic surface waves are an order of magnitude smaller than the Martian noise even at 12km depth. Thus, this important result highlights the fact that seismic events can be shallow despite the absence of surface wave detection in the data. The depths of the events must also be consistent with the maximum detection depth of the secondary phases PP, SS, PPP and SSS in the synthetics, also identified in the seismic data (for instance in Khan et al, 2021; Drilleau et al, 2022). Therefore, we identified two solutions for each event; a first crustal solution between 12 and 24km depth, and a second solution between 24 and 39km depth. The two solutions were then related to the observations and geological knowledge of the region. We have identified several potential structures at the origin of the seismic events; the extensive Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles systems have been formed by deep massive dike networks (Ernst et al, 2001; Vetterlein and Roberts, 2010; Perrin et al, 2022) coupled with crustal weakening; the Martian wrinkle ridges, in particular those at Avernus Dorsa and Terra Cimmeria, are originated by the thermal contraction of the planet and are located at the apex of reverse faults at depth (Banerdt et al, 1982; Head et al, 2002); possible deep fractures without surface expression, related to the deformation of the dichotomy, from highlands to lowlands (Frey et al, 2002; Golombek et al, 2018; Pan et al, 2020).\nWe observed a majority of best moment tensor solutions that are at depths 18km and 30km for the nine marsquakes. Seven seismic events located on Cerberus fossae are in the same orientation (NE-SW) and with very steep nodal planes (60\u201380\u2218). From our comparisons between morphology and moment tensor geometries, we concluded that S0173a, S0409d, S0809a and S0820a, which display normal faulting moment tensors, are presumably generated by subsurface normal faults, sub-parallel to the underlying dikes and to the grabens of Cerberus fossae. S0235b and S0484b, further north, are also extensive, and also related to the same seismic source type, i.e. related to normal fractures under Grjot\u00e1 Valles certainly linked to dike propagations. Moreover, our results for events S0173a and S0235b are in good agreement with those presented in the companion paper by Brinkman et al. (2021). We both found extensive solutions for these events at similar depths of about 30\u201335km. S0407a is reverse and likely result from the same faulting processes as those of S0173a, S0409d, S0809a and S0820a as the epicenters are close, but in a compressive context. S0784a is located on south lava plains, and its moment tensors in reverse regime are probably associated to a thrust fault below Avernus Dorsa, sub-parallel to the Martian dichotomy boundary. S0325a, the most distant event located on the dichotomy, is mainly reverse and possibly generated by compressive fractures related to the thermal contraction of the very old southern terrains. Our magnitude estimates are smaller than the MQS values (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021) by a factor of \u223c0.5 for the nine marsquakes, while we agree with Brinkman et al. (2021) on their \n\nM\nw\n\n estimations for S0173a and S0235b. Lastly, we also evaluated the quality factor Q which is not accurately known for Mars, however this parameter is the least constrained in this study and we could not deduce a value with confidence.\nThe InSight mission has been extended to the end of 2022. This would eventually lead to the detection of additional marsquakes in the vicinity of Elysium Planitia. An analysis on these new events would help to better understand the potential seismic sources, and how they can interact with each other. In addition, this work could be improved by addressing and resolving the main limitations we have mentioned. In particular, the structure models could be refined to take into account the lateral heterogeneities (mainly the depth of the Moho and the attenuation pattern) between the events and the landing site. And finally, continuous remote observations on structures (before and after quakes), for example from very high resolution HiRISE (McEwen et al, 2007) or CTX (Malin et al, 2007) images, would be very interesting to detect potential landslides related to marsquakes.\n\n","46":"","47":"","48":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe elastic rebound theory (Reid, 1910), mathematically described by Ohnaka (1976), assumes that faults obey regular patterns of behavior. This idea, which is based on the assumptions of characteristic earthquakes (e.g., Aki, 1984; Schwartz and Coppersmith, 1984) inherently backgrounds the work of earthquake research and forecasting since the 20th century. In some cases, the assumption underlying this hypothesis, at the base of predictions of maximum magnitudes of individual large events used to produce probabilistic hazard maps, is that faults are \u201cpredictable\u201d in the sense that they tend to rupture with the same size and mechanism (e.g. Kammerer and Ake, 2012) and that big earthquakes are most likely to strike in seismic gaps. These concepts are implicitly time-dependent and practically led to estimations of maximum magnitudes mainly based on past seismicity (Atkinson, 2004) from catalogs that are incomplete by definition (e.g., Mohammed et al., 2014; Wyss, 2015). This approach is very diffuse worldwide for the preparation of official hazard maps (e.g., the SESAME for Mediterranean basin - Jimenez et al., 2001; The United States national seismic hazard model \u2013 Petersen et al., 2015; the New Zealand national Seismic Hazard Model \u2013 Stirling et al., 2012). Hybrid approaches to estimate the maximum magnitude were proposed in order to bypass the limited time-span of seismic catalogs selecting the larger magnitude between that reported in the seismic record and that derived from fault dimension through empirical relationships (e.g., the European Seismic Hazard Model ESHM13 \u2013 Woessner et al., 2015; the Italian Seismic Hazard Model MPS19 - Meletti et al., 2021; Visini et al., 2021). In the Database of Individual Seismogenic Sources of Italy (DISS Working Group, 2021) and the European Database of Seismogenic Sources (Basili et al., 2013) maximum magnitude values proposed in the literature from detailed studies are also integrated. However, due to earthquakes' long recurrence times, these approaches may fail to consider largest magnitude events for a given location because not yet observed, hence producing underestimation of the resulting hazard (Scholz, 2019). This typically applies to regions uninhabited during historical times and now densely populated or where the recurrence time of strong earthquakes is much longer than the onset of the seismological record (Trippetta et al., 2019 and references therein). In fact, seismologists often face with the occurrence of unexpected (or uncharacteristic; Geller et al., 2015 and references therein) earthquakes that highlight the incompleteness of these approaches, which often fail (see Wyss, 2015) to predict both earthquakes magnitude, peak ground acceleration and recurrence interval (e.g., Tohoku 2011 Mw 9 instead of the predicted Mw 7.5 characteristic earthquake; Italy 2012 Mw 6.1 produced up to 0.3\u00a0g of ground acceleration instead of 0.125\u20130.150\u00a0g - 10% in 50 yrs - predicted by the official seismic hazard model; Parkfield earthquake expected at 95% probability before 1993 occurred in 2004 with ambiguities in location and characteristics with respect of what it was predicted). Moreover the concept of Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) has also been introduced, which is based on seismic history and seismotectonics and is a basic ingredient for a neodeterministic technique (NDSHA) to calculate the seismic hazard (e.g., Panza and Bela, 2020).\nTo avoid the problem of time-dependence, the maximum magnitude of earthquakes can be assessed using empirical scaling relationships that relate active faults characteristics (generally fault length and\/or fault slip) to the maximum magnitude expected in case of the rupture of the whole length of that fault (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994; Mai and Beroza, 2000; Leonard, 2010, 2014; Thingbaijam et al., 2017; Schirripa Spagnolo et al., 2021). In this latter case a big problem is the uncertainty in source characterization (e.g., Schwartz, 2018). Criteria for selection of active faults are even more markedly subjective. Further, where strain rates are low to intermediate and faults are small in dimensions and unclear in surface expression of recent activity, the connection between faults and earthquakes is not straightforward (Trippetta et al., 2019).\nHere, we propose a model for an alternative methodology to calculate the maximum magnitude expected for a region. The method is based on an invariant (on human time-scales) characteristic of the system, that is the available brittle volume, thus providing the maximum possible magnitude (i.e. the upper energy limit). This way may overcome the incompleteness of the seismic catalogs and the uncertainty in source characterization, since the effective potential is unrelated to the dimension of the faults (see Doglioni et al., 2015; Petricca et al., 2015, 2018, 2019). The maximum magnitude is calculated at each node of a 10\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0km regular grid covering the study area and is strictly time-independent with recurrence related to strain rates. The present study integrates and extends findings of previous papers where the model was preliminary applied to extensional areas (Petricca et al., 2015) and compressional areas (Petricca et al., 2019) of Italy. In this new version we propose a map of maximum possible magnitudes that covers all the kinematic regions of Italy (i.e. with extension, compression and strike-slip tectonics). Since our map provides a first estimate of the maximum magnitude, we preferred to investigate only well-constrained tectonic regions. Therefore we excluded Sardinia and Apulia, aware that these areas are potentially seismic due to the presence of faults with recent tectonic activity (see, for Sardinia, Casula et al., 2001; for Apulia Argnani et al., 2001) and moderate earthquakes in historical record with Mw ~5 (e.g. south Sardegna 1616; Rovida et al., 2021) or even Mw >6 (e.g., Salento-Apulia 1743; Galli and Naso, 2008; Nappi et al., 2017). Small geodetic rates for these regions (<1\u00a0mm\/yr; Devoti et al., 2017; Farolfi and Del Ventisette, 2017) imply that the recurrence interval of large events would be very large. Our map is a step forward with respect to previous works because it relies: 1) on a brittle-ductile transition depth (BDT) map updated with respect to that proposed in Petricca et al. (2015), that is the basis for brittle volumes estimation in extensional and strike-slip areas; 2) an updated version - with respect to that proposed in Petricca et al. (2019) - of the map of the thrusts decollement depth necessary for calculation of brittle volumes in compressional areas; 3) a more recent solution for GPS record (Devoti et al., 2017) used to compute the BDT depth and to define the annual rates of strain.\nThe map of the maximum possible magnitude of Italy is then i) compared with maximum magnitudes used to produce the Italian Seismic Hazard Model MPS19 (Meletti et al., 2021; Visini et al., 2021), and then ii) tested versus the geodetic strain rate with the scope of delimiting areas of maximum probability for next moderate\/large earthquakes occurrence.\n\n\n2\nSeismotectonics of Italy\nItaly is located along a complex plate boundary where at least three main plates (Eurasia, Africa and Adria) interact (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012). Recorded earthquakes allow the recognition of extensional, compressional and transcurrent stress fields (Fig. 1\n). The coexistence of these different tectonic regimes is the result of active subduction processes building up two mountain chains (Alps and the Apennines) and producing the Apennines back-arc extension (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012; Malinverno and Ryan, 1986). The Alps (characterized by double vergence and high elevation) and the Apennines (verging mostly eastward) belts grew on top of subduction zones characterized by slab hinges converging and diverging relative to the upper plates, respectively. The rates of motion at the surface from GPS data are in the order of a few mm\/yr (Devoti et al., 2017). Contractional deformation concentrates along the front of the Southern Apennines, the eastward offshore of Calabria, the south Tyrrhenian Basin and, mainly, along the central-northern Adriatic margins and between the Northern Apennines and the Southern Alps (Fig. 1). To the west of the active Apennines accretionary prism, the Apennines are characterized by extensional tectonics. Here, previous contractional structures (thrust faults and folds) are crosscut by active normal faults (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012). In the frontal accretionary prism and in the backarc basin, strike-slip faults mostly play a subsidiary role of transfer zones, whereas in the foreland, lithospheric transcurrent faults act as tear zones accommodating differential slab retreat in areas where strong earthquakes may occur (e.g., the Gargano and the Malta escarpment areas).\nHistorical and instrumental catalogs show a dense distribution of seismicity in Italy (Fig. 1), that has been struck by numerous moderate to strong earthquakes (Rovida et al., 2021). The most energetic earthquakes (Fig. 1) are concentrated along the extensional ridge of the Apennines where Mw exceeding 6 are frequent (e.g., Colfiorito 1997, Mw 6.0 - Amato et al., 1998; Norcia 2016 Mw 6.5 and Amatrice 2016 Mw 6.0 - Chiaraluce et al., 2017; L'Aquila 2009, Mw 6.3 -Chiarabba et al., 2009; Irpinia 1980, Mw 6.8 - Rovida et al., 2021). Large thrust earthquakes, though less numerous, were recorded in the eastern Alps (Friuli earthquake with Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.4 in 1976 - Caputo, 1976) and, possibly, in the Po Plain (1117, with Mw 6.5, although fault kinematics is not constrained - Guidoboni et al., 2005; 2012 with Mw 6.1 - Govoni et al., 2014). Although its focal mechanism remains unknown, the largest historical earthquake ever recorded in Italy has struck southeastern Sicily in 1693 (M 7.3 - https:\/\/emidius.mi.ingv.it\/CPTI15-DBMI15).\n\n\n3\nData and methods\nThe proposed procedure for the evaluation of the maximum possible magnitude, here applied to the Italian region, foresees that, via available geological and geophysical data, we define: 1) the extent of areas characterized by compressional, extensional and strike-slip tectonics; 2) the relationship between length of possible ruptures (Lf) for seismogenic faults and the maximum faulting depth (zmax) of related earthquakes - that varies from Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a02 to Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a025 depending on the tectonic regime and on the strain rate (Doglioni et al., 2015; Petricca et al., 2018; Petricca et al., 2019); 3) the maps of the active thrust decollement depth (for compressional area; Petricca et al., 2019 and this study; Table S1) and brittle-ductile transition depth (BDT for extensional and strike-slip areas; Petricca et al., 2015 and this study; Table S2). In fact, normal fault ruptures can propagate through the entire seismogenic crust, whereas thrusts frequently flatten along regional detachments and do not cut down to the brittle-ductile transition, requiring different definitions of maximum faulting depth for the two regimes. With parameters from points 1) to 3) we calculate 4) the seismogenic brittle volume and, by means of empirical relationship 5) the maximum potential magnitude based on the potential seismogenic volume. Eventually, 6) regions with maximum probability of future moderate\/large earthquakes occurrence are delimited, depending on the present strain rate. The map of the maximum possible magnitude in Italy based on the seismogenic brittle volume is finally proposed.\n\n3.1\nAreal extent of compression, tension and strike-slip deformation\nBoundaries of compressional regions (blue boxes in Fig. 1) are modified from Petricca et al. (2019) while extensional and strike-slip areas (red and green boxes in Fig. 1) are modified from Petricca et al. (2015). Homogeneous kinematic areas are defined by integrating the location of Apennines and Alps thrust fronts from literature (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012; Petricca et al., 2013), GPS data and the geometry of composite seismogenic sources from the database of the individual seismogenic sources of Italy (DISS - DISS Working Group, 2021). The closure of polygons is obtained by considering horizontal GPS velocity field along the transects published in Petricca et al. (2015), i.e., selecting the points separating extensional\/contractional fields along the whole study domain.\n\n\n3.2\nThe length - maximum fault depth ratio (C) and dip angles of Italian faults\nThe first assumption of our method is that fault ruptures show a well-defined shape ratio (C) between fault length (Lf) and maximum fault depth (zmax), that is dependent on fault-type (extensional, compressional or strike-slip). C values are here derived from individual seismogenic sources (ISS) given in the DISS database (DISS Working Group, 2021). From DISS we selected all the 43 ISSs with thrust\/transpressional kinematics (i.e., 45\u00b0\u00a0<\u00a0rake angle <135\u00b0), the 59 ISSs with normal\/transtensional kinematics (i.e., 225\u00b0\u00a0<\u00a0rake angle <315\u00b0) and all the 21 ISSs with strike slip kinematics (i.e., 135\u00b0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0rake angle \u2264225\u00b0, rake angle\u00a0\u2265315\u00b0 and rake angle \u226445\u00b0). The given values for the minimum and maximum source depth (Min depth and Max depth in the DISS nomenclature) and the source rupture length (Lf) are used to calculate the ratio between fault length and the maximum depth of faulting Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a0Lf\/(Max depth - Min depth). Values for normal faults are distributed around Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20133 (Fig. 2a), for thrust faults around Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20134 (Fig. 2b) while for strike-slip are Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20132 (Fig. 2c). Lf\/zmax ratio increases with the magnitude and the rupture length. We use obtained Lf\/zmax ranges (Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20133 and Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20134 for normal and thrust faults respectively) as end-members in the following computations of the maximum seismogenic volume. The value obtained for strike slip faults (Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20132) is constrained by very few events and is at odds with detailed studies for strike-slip events in Italy (e.g., Fracassi and Valensise, 2007; Valensise et al., 2004). For the sake of completeness, based on the literature we extended the range for strike-slips faults up to Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a03.\nFrom the same DISS database we extrapolated the maximum and minimum fault dip values for the three different regimes that are: 20\u00b0-85\u00b0 (normal), 20\u00b0-55\u00b0 (thrust) and 45\u00b0-88\u00b0 (strike-slip); the median values are 55\u00b0, 35\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 respectively (Fig. 2d-f). The maximum and minimum values are used as upper and lower bounds in brittle volume calculation while we consider the medians as the reference value in the resulting preferred map of maximum possible magnitudes. However, our calculations are extended to different fault dip values.\n\n\n3.3\nDecollement depth and Brittle-Ductile Transition Depth (BDT)\nThe maximum volume that can be activated during the seismic cycle is constrained by the depth of the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) or by the depth of the decollement of the basal active thrust (Petricca et al., 2015, 2019). Normal fault rupture tends to propagate upward cutting the brittle crust (Carminati et al., 2004). However, normal faults may flatten shallower than the brittle-ductile transition depth into low-angle faults cutting throughout low friction formations as it occurred in the 2016\u20132017 Mw6.5 Amatrice-Norcia central Italy seismic sequence (Carminati et al., 2020). Also thrust faults may not necessarily cut down to the brittle-ductile transition (Hyndman et al., 1997). It follows that, for different seismotectonic areas of Italy (Fig. 1), we utilize two different approaches that consider i) the map of the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) depth for extensional and strike-slip tectonics, and ii) the map of the active thrusts decollement depth for compressional tectonics (Fig. 3\n). The map of BDT depth is used to calculate brittle volumes in the extensional\/strike-slip domains and is produced following the procedure described in Petricca et al. (2015); is based on the same base parameters that are the heat flow (from Della Vedova et al., 2001), the crustal thickness (from Mele et al., 2013; Carafa and Barba, 2011), and the strain rate. The version of the map presented in this study is recomputed considering the last available solution for the strain rate (SR) obtained using updated GPS data (Devoti et al., 2017) with respect to the old solution used in Petricca et al. (2015). The thickness of the brittle layer of the upper crust is calculated on a 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 km grid based on the thermal profile calculated at each node. The map of the decollement depth is recomputed from Petricca et al. (2019), integrating data from compressional areas of Italy not considered in the previous version. The traces of the geological cross-sections utilized in this study are displayed in red in Fig. 3 and include datasets from Cassano et al. (1986), Merlini et al. (2002), Pezzo et al. (2020), Sch\u00f6nborn (1999), Scrocca (2006) and Doglioni and Carminati (2008).\nDue to the fact that the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) depth is possibly and locally shallower than the basal thrust depth (Petricca et al., 2019), we compare the BDT depths with the basal thrust depths selecting at each node of the compressional areas the shallower value. The BDT is shallower than the basal thrust depth in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (off-shore Sicily).\n\n\n3.4\nThe seismogenic brittle volume\nThe maximum volume that can be mobilized by a fault during the coseismic stage is quantifiable a priori. It is possible to approximate it to a triangular-base prism since it describes the deformed epicentral area determined by the volume size and the related fault length, depth and dip (Petricca et al., 2021). The volume of the prism can be obtained by considering the length of a hypothetic master fault, that is proportional to C (length - fault depth ratio; see section 3.2), multiplied by the maximum faulting depth zmax (BDT or decollement depth) and by a conjugated fault dipping 90\u00b0 opposite to the master fault (see Petricca et al., 2015 and Petricca et al., 2019 for better explanation). Brittle volumes are calculated over a regular grid of 10\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0km for the whole Italian territory. This approach aims at constraining the upper limit of the seismic energy potentially available for a given region (i.e. the maximum possible brittle volume) irrespective of the detail of knowledge of the area (e.g., the presence of blind seismogenic faults or fault inactivity longer than historic record are overcome). The height of the prism is assumed to be equal to the BDT depth for normal and strike-slip faults and to the active decollement depth for thrust faults. The volume is calculated using the relationship (Petricca et al., 2019):\n\n\n\n\n1\n)\n\nV\n=\n\nC\n2\n\n\n\nz\n3\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\ncot\n\n\u03b1\n\n+\ncot\n\n\n90\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the fault dip (20\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 for thrust, 20\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 for normal and 45\u00b0 to 88\u00b0 for strike-slip faults), zmax is the deepest tip of the activation of a seismogenic thrust or the BDT depth along a seismogenic normal or strike-slip fault, C is the Lf\/zmax ratio (1 to 4 for thrust, 1 to 3 for normal and strike-slip faults). Brittle volumes up to about 1.7\u2219104\u00a0km3 are obtained in compressional areas assuming a fault dip of 35\u00b0 (i.e. the median value characterizing active thrusts in Italy) and considering C\u00a0=\u00a04. Brittle volumes up to 7.8\u2219104\u00a0km3 are obtained in extensional areas assuming a fault dip of 55\u00b0 (i.e., the median value) and considering C\u00a0=\u00a03. Brittle volumes up to 6.4\u2219104\u00a0km3 are obtained in strike-slip areas assuming a fault dip of 80\u00b0 (i.e., the median value) and considering C\u00a0=\u00a01 (Fig. 4\n). The full range of variation of maximum brittle volumes obtained by changing initial parameters (fault dip angles \u03b1 and shape ratio C) are summarized in Table 1\n and collected in Table S3.\n\n\n3.5\nMaximum potential magnitude and tectonic regime\nIn extensional settings, gravity favors faulting because, according to Anderson's model (Anderson, 1951), the maximum stress axis is approximately parallel to the lithostatic load. The lithostatic load rather buffers (i.e., counteracts) the elastic energy accumulated during the interseismic period in thrust or strike-slip faulting. The elastic rebound is commonly considered as the main model for earthquake generation, being inferred as the mechanism dissipating the elastic energy accumulated during the interseismic period. This is likely true for contractional and strike-slip tectonic settings, but in extensional environments, the influence of gravity may rather be dominant (Doglioni et al., 2011; Bignami et al., 2020). The occurrence of different mechanisms controlling earthquakes in different tectonic settings must be considered when calculating magnitudes expected from a potential brittle volume. A linear correlation was proposed between earthquake magnitudes and the logarithm of the seismogenic volume (Bath and Duda, 1964; Petricca et al., 2015, 2019). The maximum potential magnitude (M) can be calculated as (Bath and Duda, 1964):\n\n\n2\n)\n\n\nM\nBD\n\n=\n\n\nl\no\ng\n\n\nV\n\n\u2212\n9\n.\n58\n\n\n1\n.\n47\n\n\n\n\nwhere V is the brittle volume in cm3. MBD is appropriate for thrust and strike-slip areas, but it does not consider the role of the gravitational potential, that is dominant in extensional tectonic, for which we can introduce the potential residual energy RU:\n\n\n3\n)\n\nRU\n=\n\u03c1Vg\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\ncos\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\ns\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1V is the mass of a volume V (km3) having density \u03c1 (we adopt average value for continental crust 2600\u00a0kg\/m3; Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981); \u03bc is the fault friction coefficient (0.6 according to Byerlee, 1978), us the average coseismic slip (in m) and \u03b1 the assumed fault dip. For extensional areas, the maximum possible magnitude is calculated as (Choy and Boatwright, 1995):\n\n\n4\n)\n\n\nM\nCH\n\n=\n\n2\n3\n\nlog\n\n\nRU\n\u00d7\n\nr\nc\n\n\n\n\u2013\n3.2\n\n\nwhere rc is the seismic radiation coefficient (Aki and Richards, 1980) here assumed equal to 1.0 (Choy and Boatwright, 1995; Doglioni et al., 2011). Since the gravity force must be considered in extensional tectonics we calculate MCH for extensional areas. MBD is more appropriate to be computed in thrust and strike-slip areas.\n\nPetricca et al. (2018) showed that for thrust tectonics (i.e., where elastic force dominates) a given brittle volume has a potential magnitude that increases by 1 when the shortening rate is 10 times faster. Italy (excluding volcanic areas) is characterized by strain rates in the range of 1 to 5\u00a0mm\/yr (Devoti et al., 2017). We used velocities interpolated from Devoti et al. (2017) (Fig. 5\n) to correct the maximum magnitudes predicted in compressional and strike-slip areas. The velocity has been normalized in the 0\u20131 range and added to the magnitude obtained by volumetric constraints. Eventually, we get that the maximum magnitude predicted by our model depends on the brittle volume plus the gravitational potential in extensional areas and on the brittle volume plus the strain rate in compressional and strike-slip areas. The difference in methodology is consistent with the fact that, in the brittle volume - predicted magnitude diagram of Fig. 6\n, the magnitudes calculated at each node with our preferred model are aligned along a curve for extensional tectonic settings (red curve), while for compressional and strike-slip tectonic settings, for which the same brittle volume can predict different magnitudes depending on the strain rate, the calculated magnitudes occur in bands (blue for compression; green for strike-slip).\n\n\n\n4\nThe maximum potential magnitude of Italy\nThe map of magnitudes calculated from maximum brittle volumes is presented in Fig. 7\n for well constrained areas of Italy (compressional, extensional and strike-slip areas; Table S3) assuming the following values for geometric parameters: a fault dip of 35\u00b0 (thrust), 55\u00b0 (normal) and 80\u00b0 (strike-slip), Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a04 (thrust), Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a03 (normal) and Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01 (strike-slip). According to the model presented here, the maximum potential magnitude in regions under tension ranges between 4.5 and 7.6. Magnitudes between 4.3 and 7.1 are obtained considering Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01 while magnitude range increases to 4.1\u20138.7 considering Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a03 and increasing the fault dip to 85\u00b0 (Fig. 8a and Table 1). The maximum magnitude is predicted along the Apennines axis, i.e. where the brittle layer is thicker (Fig. 3) and the most recent energetic normal earthquakes of Italy are concentrated (e.g. Colfiorito 1998 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.0; Norcia Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.5 and Amatrice Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.02016; L'Aquila 2009 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.3; Irpinia 1980 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.9). Even larger earthquakes characterize the Southern Apennines area, with historical events that reached magnitudes up to 7.3 (see section 2 for references).\nIn thrust-fault settings, a 3.8\u20137.8 potential magnitude range is obtained (Fig. 7); maximum potential magnitude range decreases to 3.8\u20137.4 assuming minimum Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01 and maximum fault dip of 55\u00b0. A 3.9\u20138.0 Mw range is obtained assuming Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a04 and fault dip of 20\u00b0 (Table1). The maximum magnitudes are predicted where the decollement depth (zmax) is deeper (Fig. 3): the front of the Apennines accretionary prism in the Po Plain (where the Emilia sequence took place in 2012 with Mw 6.1 and Mw 6 earthquakes); the Eastern Alps where the Mw 6.4 Friuli 1976 earthquake occurred. Magnitudes decrease moving toward the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea (i.e., at the external thrust front). The southeast offshore Calabrian accretionary prism (notice that catalogs report only small earthquakes for this region) suffers from the absence of GPS data on the Ionian Sea used to interpolate the velocity field considered for magnitude calculation (great error due to unconstrained interpolation). This results in a very noisy map in those areas and where the larger magnitudes are predicted for thrust settings. Moderate seismicity (4\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a05.5) is recorded in the South Tyrrhenian Sea. The calculated maximum potential magnitude is consistent with the strongest thrust-fault earthquake known from historical catalogs (Mw 6.5 occurred in 1117 along the Southern Alps front; Guidoboni et al., 2005).\nMaximum magnitudes in strike-slip areas are expected to vary between 5.6 and 7.6 (Fig. 8a). Considering a minimum fault dip angle of 45\u00b0, consistent with observations, the range decreases to 5.3\u20137.3 while it increases to 6.0\u20138.0 in case of faults dipping 85\u00b0 and Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a03 (Table 1). A magnitude value of 6.7 is reported for the most energetic strike-slip earthquake in Italy (the 1627 Gargano earthquake Mw 6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10; Rovida et al., 2021). Further, M\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 has been experienced several times in southern Apennines and Sicily (Daunia 1361 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.0; Gargano 1646 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.7; Tavoliere delle Puglie 1731 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.3; Melfi 1851 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.5; Gondola 1893 Mw\u00a0=\u00a05.4; Patti gulf 1978 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.1 - Rovida et al., 2021).\n\n\n5\nDiscussions\nThe model presented here is based on the potential brittle volume concept and is time independent, i.e., magnitudes are calculated using physical parameters, regardless of the seismic catalogs. Our model provides a basis for seismic hazard assessment, alternative to those so far used as input required for the following techniques (e.g., PSHA, DSHA, NDSHA). The leading concept is that the brittle volume, during the interseismic period, is an accumulator of seismic energy, which is entirely dissipated at the coseismic stage. This energy is mainly elastic for thrusts and strike-slip faults, whereas it is gravitational for normal faults (Doglioni et al., 2015; Petricca et al., 2015, 2019, 2021). After calculating the volume potentially involved in faulting, it is possible to derive (by means of empirical relationships) the associated earthquake magnitudes (Bath and Duda, 1964; Petricca et al., 2015; Petricca et al., 2019).\nOur results show that maximum possible magnitude increases with the assumed shape ratio factor (C) and with increasing fault dip angle in extensional and strike-slip settings, whereas it increases for decreasing fault dip angles in compressional settings (Table 1 and Table S3) as shown in Petricca et al. (2021). Predicted magnitudes vary in the range of \u00b10.77, \u00b1 0.37 and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 for normal, strike-slip and thrust fault earthquakes respectively. Magnitudes calculated at each node of our model grow exponentially with respect to brittle volume for normal faulting (red curve in Fig. 6). In the case of thrust and strike-slip faulting the magnitude calculated for a same brittle volume depends on the strain rate (i.e. the faster the deformation the larger the magnitude), and the exponential growth of the curves depicts bands instead of a simple curve (blue and green bands for compression and strike-slip respectively in Fig. 6); the wider the band the larger the range of variation in the strain rate and, consequently, the predicted magnitude. Lower values for the maximum possible magnitude are obtained in the thrust fault setting (Fig. 8a) since the decollement depth is on average shallower (\u22481\u201317\u00a0km) than the BDT depth (\u22484\u201323\u00a0km). Furthermore, the smaller magnitude observed in compressional areas are also due to lower strain rates than in extensional settings (Petricca et al., 2018). The predicted magnitudes are sensitive to the choice of initial parameters (fault dip [\u03b1] and geometry [Lf\/zmax]) and to the tectonic regime. In fact, our map is intended as a fitting model with respect to a spectrum of variation of possible magnitude values. The total range of variation of predictions (Fig. 8a) is wider for normal faulting (up to 1.5 points for large magnitudes) than for strike-slip and thrust faulting (less than 0.8 points). The prediction of our preferred model (black line in Fig. 8a) is centered on the error band (green) related to strike-slip areas, whereas it is shifted to the lower part of the error band (red) for extensional areas, and to the upper part for compressional areas (blue band). Consequently, the maximum positive errors occur for normal faults (Fig. 8b) and the maximum negative errors for thrust faults (Fig. 8c).\nBased on our best model, we perform a quantitative comparison among maximum magnitudes predicted by the present study with those 1) from seismic catalogs (CPTI15v3.0 - Rovida et al., 2021; CFTI5Med - Guidoboni et al., 2019), 2) from fault length-magnitude empirical relationships (Trippetta et al., 2019) and 3) from integrated studies (DISS 3.3.0 \u2013 DISS Working Group, 2021).\n\n1)\nModel results are tested against the Italian seismicity with Mw\u00a0\u2265\u00a05.0 and depth\u00a0\u2264\u00a030\u00a0km collected in the CPTI15v3.0 (Rovida et al., 2021) covering the 1005\u20132019 time interval and the CFTI5Med (Guidoboni et al., 2019) covering the 0\u20131997 time interval (Fig. 9a). The difference (\u0394Mw) between magnitudes predicted by our model and observed magnitudes for the whole study domain are plotted in Fig. 9 against magnitude and year of occurrence of each event. The majority of historical\/instrumental earthquakes are in agreement with predictions of our model (Fig. 9b-c). In some cases, the model, intended to predict maximum magnitude for a given location, overestimates magnitude of observed events. The model underestimates by 0.1\u20130.2 the magnitude of a few events along the Apennines chain and in the Tyrrhenian Sea, plus two events in Sicily. The magnitude of a thrust event occurred in 1117 (Veronese earthquake Mw 6.5 in Po Plain \u2013 Guidoboni et al., 2005) is underestimated by \u22480.28.\n\n\n2)\n\nTrippetta et al. (2019), assuming that any fault can in principle be reactivated, compared the maximum magnitudes obtained by an extensive compilation of faults in Italy assessed by means of empirical relationships (Fault Length Earthquake Magnitude - FLEM) with magnitudes from national seismic catalogs. Their results show in most cases a good agreement between predicted and observed magnitudes, with differences that are in the \u00b11.0 range (in well-constrained areas) but almost always underestimating the observed value for Mw\u00a0\u22656.5 (see their Fig. 13). By comparing magnitudes predicted by our study with FLEMs in Trippetta et al. (2019), it follows that magnitude estimates are larger for our model when Mw\u00a0>\u00a07.0, while larger FLEMs are given when Mw\u00a0<\u00a06.0. A good agreement between the two models is observed for 6.0\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a07.0, where the regression lines intercept the reference line (Fig. 10\n). The reason for underestimation of low magnitudes is that magnitudes obtained from fault lengths suffer the impossibility to resolve fault continuity and segmentation (i.e., the faults used for magnitude by Trippetta et al., 2019, could be segmented). In addition, the underestimation can be due to the lack of knowledge where detailed geologic studies (i.e. better estimates of fault dimensions) are not available.\n\n\n3)\nComparing our results with maximum magnitudes assigned to individual seismogenic sources (ISSs) of the DISS (DISS Working Group, 2021 \u2013 Table S4) the following strengths and weaknesses of our method emerge (Fig. 11a-b). Pros: i) as conservative as they were intended to be, our predicted magnitudes are larger than those of earthquakes that occurred both in historical and instrumental epochs. This is especially true for normal and strike-slip earthquakes whose magnitude mainly depends on the BDT depth, well-defined for the Italian territory; ii) the overestimation with respect of magnitudes defined for historic and instrumental events decreases moving from high (max overestimation \u2248 +1.5) to low (max overestimation \u2248 +0.5) magnitude earthquakes (see colored lines in Fig. 11a-b). In few cases, the magnitudes reported in the DISS ISSs are larger than those predicted by our model. However, these earthquakes are associated with sources that produced their last earthquake before the XIX century. Overall, our model overestimates magnitudes and, consequently, should account also for uncharacteristic earthquakes (e.g. Geller et al., 2015 and references therein); iii) in Italy larger magnitudes are predicted for normal, intermediate for strike-slip and lower for thrust faults earthquakes, fitting DISS predictions. Cons: an underestimation of large magnitudes (M\u00a0>\u00a06.0) emerges for thrust fault earthquakes. Worth of notice is that thrust earthquakes larger than 6.5 are still not recorded instrumentally, so far. It cannot be excluded that such inconsistency may result from the overestimation of magnitudes in historic catalogs based on macroseismic estimation. Our underestimation could also be related to large error (\u2212 a few km) in the definition of the maximum thrust decollement depth (see Petricca et al., 2019). Notice that each individual seismogenic source (ISS) of the DISS is associated with a composite seismogenic source (CSS) that may include one or more individual sources characterized by homogeneous parametrization (see Basili et al., 2008 for details). In the last release of the DISS (v3.3.0) a new magnitude for CSSs is calculated based on scaling relation from Leonard (2014), a step in the direction of an increase in the maximum magnitude values. In Fig. 11c and d, we provide another comparison between magnitudes predicted by our preferred model and the magnitude assigned to composite seismogenic sources (CSS), highlighting how the differences between the two models are in the range of \u00b10.5.\n\n\n\nThe Italian Seismic Hazard Model MPS19 (Meletti et al., 2021; Visini et al., 2021) estimates the maximum magnitude for 18 tectonically homogeneous macro-areas by selecting the maximum value reported in the CPTI15 catalog (Rovida et al., 2021) and the value reported in the ISS of the DISS database (DISS Working Group, 2021), assigning to each area the largest value between the two magnitudes. This raises the point of what level of hazard must be considered, that is a questionable and subjective decision especially in PSHA, since improper selection of parameters may lead to either unsafe or overly conservative designs. As it emerges from this discussion, the maximum magnitude is a prime parameter that, in our opinion, should be as conservative as possible as our method has demonstrated to be. Our model tendency to overestimation of magnitudes may occur because of involved brittle volumes smaller than expected. This may be due to faults detached at levels shallower than the brittle ductile transition, or to fault aseismic behavior. Further, the calculation for extensional tectonic regimes depends on the radiation coefficient that we kept equal to 1.0 but could be much smaller (down to 0.03; Choy and Boatwright, 1995), thus reducing the magnitude value by \u22481. However, strong or major earthquakes should not be excluded as in case they could have longer recurrence time (not recorded yet).\nIn seismic areas earthquakes recurrence depends on the velocity at which deformation, currently, takes place. Low magnitude earthquakes occur at all observed strain rates, while larger magnitudes occur at low strain rates only. In fact, Riguzzi et al. (2012) observed for Italy that past earthquakes with magnitudes >5.0 occurred where geodetic strain rate (SR) is <20 nanostrain\/yr, while M is limited to 5.0 where SR\u00a0>\u00a020 nanostrain\/yr. Further, SR =40 nanostrain\/yr is, for Italy, the bound value separating areas characterized by significant seismic activity from those affected by background seismicity (Riguzzi et al., 2012). However, small strain rates imply that the recurrence interval of large events would be very large.\nAccording to Riguzzi et al. (2012) future earthquakes are more likely to occur sooner in regions with low SR (i.e., regions having the same tectonic regime and geodetic velocity, but relatively lower strain; gray areas in Fig. 12\n), having longer recurrence time for contractional settings (Riguzzi et al., 2012). High strain rates (>20 nanostrain\/yr) lead to lower probability to generate strong earthquakes soon and are observed in regions struck by important seismic sequences in the last century (i.e., Friuli 1976 in the Eastern Alps; Emilia 2012 in the Po Plain; Fucino 1915, Irpinia 1980, Colfiorito 1997, L'aquila 2009 and central Italy in 2016 along the Apennine extensional belt, 1905\u20131908 in Calabria and Sicily; see Fig. 1 and red areas in Fig. 12). This information can be integrated with our Mmax predictions. In terms of hazard, we expect large earthquakes to occur in low strain rate areas only if there is a potential of Mw\u00a0>\u00a05 in our map. Large magnitudes are expected due to low strain rate in the compressional part of northern Italy (5\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a06.5). Earthquakes of magnitude 5\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a06.5\u20137.0 are expected in central Calabria (extension) and Ionian off-shore (compression) where the higher strain is recorded in the accretionary prism of the Calabria subduction. Magnitudes between 5.8 and 6.0 are likely to occur in contractional regions in the Adriatic Sea. Notice that slow strain rates are associated with shallower depth of the decollement layer for thrusts (Petricca et al., 2018), hence limiting the maximum value for earthquake magnitudes. Further, a thin crust prevents the occurrence of crustal earthquakes with Mw\u00a0>\u00a05 in the extensional setting of the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nIt should finally be noted that there are few regions along the central-northern Apennines extensional chain where Mw7 are predicted by our model, and that have not yet experienced strong earthquakes in the recent period (compare gray areas in Fig. 12 with the same points in Fig. 7). These areas are located north of the 1997, 2009 and 2016 seismic sequences of Central Italy (events 8, 9, 11 and 12 in Fig. 1). Notice that the definition of the strain rate strictly depends on the GPS network density, accuracy, time-span and it is not homogeneous within the territory. This makes our indication just preliminary with no intentions to provide a time for the occurrence of the next earthquake.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nA theoretical model aimed at providing values for the maximum possible magnitude is proposed and applied to the Italian area. The maximum possible magnitude is calculated on available brittle volumes obtained considering active thrusts decollement depths (in compressional areas) or brittle-ductile transition depths (in extensional and strike-slip areas). Maximum magnitudes depend on elastic energy and therefore on strain rates for thrusts and strike-slip faults, and on gravitational energy for normal faults. The magnitudes are proportional to the ratio between fault lengths and the maximum depth of faulting. The Maximum magnitudes are calculated utilizing empirical relationships and presented in a single map. The largest predicted values are 7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 for thrust faulting, 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 for normal faulting and 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37 for strike-slip faulting. These values are higher with respect to the largest magnitude of thrust (Mw 6.5\u20136.7), normal (7.3) and strike-slip (Mw 6.7) related earthquakes recorded in Italy. This could be interpreted as related to two possibilities, i.e., 1) an overestimation of the computed volume due, for example, to decollement layers shallower than the BDT, or 2) a longer recurrence time of strong and major earthquakes that have not yet occurred in the Italian historical record. The occurrence of earthquakes with a given magnitude may be related to current strain rates. The combination of our map of maximum possible magnitude with the map of current strain rates by Devoti et al. (2017) shows that a large part of the Italian territory is prone to earthquakes with M\u00a0>\u00a05 in the near future.\n\n\nCredit statement\nPatrizio Petricca: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Data curation, Writing- Original draft preparation, Visualization, Formal analysis, Supervision.

Analysis of interplay between crustal fabrics and faulting is best performed in dense 2D and 3D seismic reflection datasets, especially in modern high-quality, long-offset data with extended record length that allow imaging of the middle-lower crust below shallow fault networks. Thereby, fundamental links between preserved sedimentary basins bound by faults, basement fabrics, and events of subsidence and uplift can be established (e.g. Collanega et al., 2019; Kirkpatrick et al., 2013; Prosser, 1993; Ravn\u00e5s et al., 2000; Strugale et al., 2021). Basement fabrics are mainly structural heterogeneities inherited from orogenic events (e.g. Bird et al., 2015; Wernicke and Snow, 1998), post-orogenic extensional collapse tectonics (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Braathen and Osmundsen, 2020; Jolivet et al., 1998; Osmundsen et al., 2021), previous rift phases (e.g. Duffy et al., 2015; Manatschal et al., 2015; Serck and Braathen, 2019; Tvedt et al., 2013) and\/or tectonic inversion events (e.g. Collanega et al., 2019). The North Sea offers a unique laboratory, as the bounding mainland offers detailed insight into the collapse of the Caledonides that can be projected offshore (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Fossen et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Wiest et al., 2020). Many of these basins have been explored for hydrocarbons since the 1960's, resulting in hydrocarbon discoveries and acquisition of a large catalogue of seismic and well data (Faleide et al., 2015). Limited record length for seismic data below target horizons for exploration wells, however, have left a knowledge gap of the geological evolution of the North Sea area before the well-constrained Permo-Triassic rift episode. With improved seismic data coverage and quality, along with recent hydrocarbon discoveries in fractured and weathered basement, there is renewed interest in both the crystalline basement and the pre-rift evolution of the area (Fig. 1\n) (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016; Riber et al., 2015). Drilled basement highs around the North Sea rift system has yielded useful information about the configuration of the underlying basement rocks, which varies in terms of lithology, structures and pre-Caledonian affinity (Lundmark et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015, 2019; Slagstad et al., 2011). Importantly, basement penetrated in the Utsira High are Ordovician-Silurian allochthonous crystalline rocks, predominantly granitoids (Lundmark et al., 2014; Slagstad et al., 2011).\nSeveral regional studies of the Norwegian Continental Shelf in the North Sea have emphasized offshore continuations of major structures mapped onshore (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Fossen et al., 2017; Fossen and Hurich, 2005; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016, 2019; Wiest et al., 2020). Robust interpretations have been facilitated by increasingly higher quality seismic data, which has allowed for seismic facies analysis of deeply buried basement rock units across wide areas. These areas include the Utsira High, which occupies a position on the flank of several large rift basins that developed during several extensional episodes (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Phillips et al., 2016, 2019). Relationships between rift faults rooted in basement and underlying extensional shear zones from collapse of the Caledonian Orogeny have been established (Phillips et al., 2016, 2019). However, no attempts have been made to discuss the magnitude of vertical movements seen in the light of post-Caledonian large-scale detachment faulting, qualify the timing of uplift events, or consider whether detachment-related vertical movements affected basins and faults. In this article, we aim at addressing these topics by re-appraising the structural development of the Utsira High and adjacent areas, taking into account recent advances in our understanding of detachment faulting and metamorphic core complex evolution. We link large-magnitude faulting from the Devonian onwards to km-scale vertical movements of the Utsira High with excision of crystalline basement and parts of the sedimentary succession. In this context, we consider the Utsira High a metamorphic core complex, as previously suggested by Phillips et al. (2019).\n\n\n2\nGeological framework\nNumerous tectonic provinces show transitions from collision to subsequent extensional tectonics, commonly recorded as fast exhumation of middle-lower crust in metamorphic core complexes (Braathen and Osmundsen, 2020; Brun et al., 2018; Fossen et al., 2017). Outstanding examples are found in onshore-offshore links of central Norway, from where an evolution of polyphase faulting that ultimately lead to continental breakup have been described (Osmundsen et al., 2021; Peron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2020). Further south, extension appears less comprehensive, ascribed to aborted rift events (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Fossen et al., 2017; Wiest et al., 2020).\nThe North Sea basin consists of a series of large rift grabens\/half-grabens bounded by prominent basement highs. The variable-thickness sedimentary fill overlies crystalline crust that was assembled during the Sveconorwegian orogeny and reorganized during the Caledonian orogeny (Roffeis and Corfu, 2014; Slagstad et al., 2013). The crust constitutes a patchwork of igneous, metamorphic and metasedimentary rock units in a nappe stack (F\u00e6rseth et al., 1995; Gee et al., 2008; Lundmark et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015; Slagstad et al., 2011; Ziegler, 1975, 1982). The nappe stack was dissected by extensional faults and shear zones related to the Devonian collapse of the Caledonian orogeny (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Braathen et al., 2000, 2018; Fossen, 2010; Norton, 1986; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001). Detachment faulting generated an array of supradetachment basins along the Norwegian North Sea margin (Osmundsen et al., 2000; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Vetti and Fossen, 2012). Although challenging to delineate in seismic data, and infrequently penetrated by exploration wells, recent onshore-offshore correlations suggest the system of Devonian extensional shear zones and basins extends into the North Sea Basin, forming the structural template on which the North Sea rift subsequently developed (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2019; Wiest et al., 2020). Extensional faulting events, most notably in the Permo-Triassic and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, led to deposition of wedge-shaped sedimentary growth packages in large half-graben basins (Badley et al., 1988; Duffy et al., 2015; Fazlikhani et al., 2021; Mulrooney et al., 2020; Odinsen et al., 2000; Phillips et al., 2019; Ziegler, 1992). We address the polyphase rift evolution by a detailed analysis of the Utsira High and adjacent areas. Following the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rift event, deformation migrated west of the UK to the Atlantic rift, leaving the North Sea as a failed rift (Erratt et al., 1999; Glennie, 1995; Ziegler, 1992). In the North Sea Basin, thermal subsidence persisted through the late Mesozoic into the Paleocene with deposition of a sedimentary package several kilometers thick (e.g. Baig et al., 2019; Gabrielsen et al., 2001).\nThe Utsira High is a structural culmination located in the Norwegian North Sea between the Viking Graben to the west, Stord Basin to the east and Ling Depression to the south (Fig. 1). It is cored by basement rocks, and major faults delineate its eastern and western margins (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lundmark et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015). The south flank constitutes a south-dipping slope of the top basement surface towards the Ling Depression. A similar dipslope into the Viking Graben exists on the west side. The Utsira High was subaerially exposed for extended periods of time, as indicated by missing strata and weathering profiles capping the crystalline basement (Riber et al., 2015, 2019). Improved deep seismic imaging in the North Sea basin has allowed for seismic facies analysis of basement rocks, shedding light on pre-rift extensional shear zones that are exploited or cross-cut by younger rift faults (e.g. Bird et al., 2015; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016; Wiest et al., 2020). The Utsira High has been indicated to represent a metamorphic core complex that developed in the footwall of the Utsira Shear Zone based on the mapped shape of reflector packages in basement rocks (Phillips et al., 2019).\n\n\n3\nData and methods\n\n3.1\nData\nThe area has been investigated through interpretation of approximately 20,000\u00a0km of TGS\u2019 CFI-NSR long-offset 2D seismic reflection data. 2D line spacing is mostly 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05 km with certain areas more sparsely (10x10km) or densely (1.25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.25\u00a0km) covered. Roughly 3600\u00a0km2 of publicly available 3D data downloaded from the Diskos database allowed for more detailed interpretation of certain areas of the Utsira High (Fig. 1). Table 1\n summarizes relevant parameters of acquisition and resolution of the seismic data. Publicly available well data have been utilized for constraining ages of seismic reflector packages.\n\n\n\n4\nMethods\nConventional seismic interpretation was carried out using the DUG Insight 4 and Schlumberger Petrel 2020 seismic interpretation softwares. A geomodel was generated from 2D and 3D line interpretations, facilitating calculations of time structure maps and time thickness maps. Scientific color maps of Crameri (2021) are used for displaying seismic lines and maps. Seismic interpretation of 11 surfaces ranging in age from Quaternary to Devonian(?), in addition to a number of faults, forms the framework of this study. Seismic facies analysis allows for separation of basement rock units. Seismic facies units and seismic facies relationships have been mapped following a similar workflow to those outlined in recent papers by e.g. Fazlikhani et al. (2017), Gresseth et al. (2021), Lenhart et al. (2019), Phillips et al. (2016, 2019), Strugale et al. (2021) and Wiest et al. (2020), where contrasting facies units and truncating relationships locate tectonic boundaries.\n2D structural restoration of a seismic section with faults and horizons have been performed using MOVE 2020 software from Petex. Prior to restoration, the seismic line was depth converted based on a velocity model that was built with migration velocities from TGS's processing. The velocity model was adjusted to reflect our regional understanding of the basement rock distribution, together with a high-confidence Top basement interpretation. A constant velocity of 6200\u00a0m\/s was selected for the crystalline basement. Structural restoration consisted of a combination of successive modeling steps including decompaction, unfolding by simple shear and flexural slip, and move-on-fault algorithms. Eroded strata were reconstructed based on net erosion estimates for the area by Baig et al. (2019). Further details on the structural restoration can be found in Appendix 1.\n\n\n5\nSeismic facies\nThe seismic data used for this study vary in terms of acquisition year, acquisition parameters and seismic processing, resulting in variations of the seismic image. Deep imaging of basement rocks is not the main focus of commercial seismic data acquisition in the North Sea; therefore, the seismic imaging of basement rocks is variable, not only from one dataset to the next but occasionally also between adjacent lines within the same dataset. Nevertheless, certain characteristics of the seismic signal, such as reflection amplitude, frequency, continuity and geometry of reflection sets are readily mappable on a semi-regional scale. This mapping has allowed for subdivision of basement rocks into discrete seismic facies (SF) (Fig. 2\n). We follow a similar workflow to previous publications focused on basement reflectivity in the Norwegian North Sea, some also considering onshore-offshore relationships (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016, 2019; Wiest et al., 2020).\n\n5.1\nSeismic facies 1 (SF1)\nSF1 is characterized by low reflectivity and discontinuous reflections. The upper basement unit consists predominantly of SF1, forming the depositional substrate for cover sediments (Figs. 1d, 2). In the upper basement unit, the chaotic SF1 reflection pattern is cross-cut by both steep and gently dipping reflections. The steep reflections are persistent through much of the unit and are often seen in relation to steep faults that either offset or terminate at the top-basement surface. Some steep reflections sole out in the boundary with a lower basement unit (SF2) (Figs. 3a, 4a\n). The upper basement unit varies greatly in TWT thickness. The thinner parts of the unit (~1000\u00a0ms TWT) are mostly centered under the high, thickening towards the east, west and south into the Stord Basin (~4500\u00a0ms TWT), Viking Graben and Ling Depression, respectively (Fig. 5e). Where the upper basement unit is thin, the SF1 fabric is seen to mimic the shape of the boundary surface to the SF2 basement unit below. At the southern Utsira flank, the SF1 fabric within the upper basement unit is cross-cut by a set of strong amplitude, subhorizontal reflections. Steep faults that bound sedimentary basins sole out on these reflections (Fig. 6\n). SF1 reflections are commonly truncated by faults (e.g. Fig. 1d). Locally within the East Shetland Platform, faint stratification of the uppermost basement is observed to be truncated at the Top basement surface (Fig. 3a).\nThe low reflectivity suggests the SF1 represents a rather homogeneous rock mass. Most wells that penetrate into basement in the study area report granitic basement rocks dated to c. 430\u00a0Ma (Lundmark et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015, 2019; Slagstad et al., 2011). We therefore interpret the bulk of the upper basement unit, which consists entirely of SF1, as an allochthonous body of granite, which was emplaced as part of the nappe stack during the Caledonian orogeny and later cross-cut by steep, brittle faults whose persistence is typical for such a homogeneous lithology. SF3 of Fazlikhani et al. (2017), interpreted as \u201cProterozoic basement\u201d, is reminiscent of our SF1 in terms of its described discontinuous, chaotic reflection pattern. Their SF3, however, has not been constrained at depth to a similar extent as our SF1. Faintly stratified SF1 units in the East Shetland Platform are interpreted as Devonian sediments, consistent with Patruno et al. (2019) and Platt and Cartwright (1999). The weak reflections from the Devonian section may result from homogeneous sedimentary deposits, significant compaction from burial that increase seismic homogeneity, and masking from high-amplitude sedimentary units above (e.g. chalk deposits). The strongly variable thickness of the upper basement unit reflects different uplift and erosion across the study area with a relatively larger crustal uplift of the Utsira High compared to adjacent areas (Fig. 5e). Differences in thickness could be used as a measure of differential erosion and, hence, shed light on crustal uplift patterns.\n\n\n5.2\nSeismic facies 2 (SF2)\nSF2 has a medium- to high reflective seismic signature with a reflector continuity that varies from moderately continuous to fully continuous over distances of 10's of km's. The reflections are organized in bundles of shingled to undulating reflections that form local and semi-regional culminations. SF2 is the sole constituent of the lower basement unit, consistently observed under the SF1 upper basement unit. The lower basement unit extends down to the base of the seismic sections at 9\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 2). The Top-reflective-basement-surface (TRB) forms the boundary between SF1 and SF2 under the Utsira High and Viking Graben, but becomes less distinctive under the East Shetland Platform, and projects below data coverage (> 9\u00a0s TWT) under the Stord Basin. Sigmoidal reflector packages that converge with parallel upper and lower boundaries are occasionally identifiable on the west flank of the Utsira High (Fig. 7c) and on the East Shetland Platform at the Viking Graben margin (Figs. 4c, 3b). On the east flank of the Utsira High, however, these asymmetric structures dominate and are bounded by an east-dipping narrow rock body categorized as SF3 (Fig. 3c, 7b)). Towards the center of the Utsira High, SF2 reflections are more symmetrical and anastomosing than on the flanks (Fig. 3a)). Close to SF1 units, the SF2 fabric mimics the morphology of the TRB (Figs. 3, 4, 7d).\nSF2 differs greatly from SF1 in that its reflections are higher amplitude and more continuous throughout the dataset. The multi-scale encased sigmoidal reflector patterns resemble S\u2013C structures typical for simple-shear ductile deformation (Berth\u00e9 et al., 1979; Lister and Snoke, 1984), with several recent publications discussing large-scale S\u2013C structures in seismic data (Clerc et al., 2015; Lenhart et al., 2019; Peron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2020; Torvela et al., 2013). The SF2 seismic facies varies in configuration across the Utsira High. Anastomosing\/undulating reflections are most common in the central part of the high, while at the flanks the reflection pattern is more reminiscent of S\u2013C structures. These structures are mapped on different scales, up to several seconds TWT thick and consistently mappable over lengths of 10's of km's (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the structures seem to be best developed on the east flank, where they indicate top-E tectonic transport (Fig. 7b). Here, the uppermost S\u2013C structures are capped by a SF3 rock mass, the Utsira Shear Zone, which is seen as the downdip component of major normal faults displacing the TRB (Fig. 3). The less pronounced S\u2013C structures on the west flank of the Utsira High indicate top-W transport (Fig. 7c). The large-scale ductile deformation observed within SF2 units overlaps with descriptions by Lenhart et al. (2019) of their SF4. Their study focused on the M\u00e5l\u00f8y Slope, approximately 300\u00a0km northwest of our study area, in proximal position with respect to extensional systems mapped onshore Western Norway (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990). Hence, their study is not directly comparable to ours in terms of rock units, although the style of deformation has similarities. We consider SF2 to represent Caledonian nappes that have deformed in an overall ductile manner during overprinting extensional episodes that succeeded the Caledonian orogeny.\n\n\n5.3\nSeismic facies 3 (SF3)\nSF3 units are observed as relatively narrow bands of strong amplitude, continuous, parallel reflections. This seismic facies either trace the boundary between SF1 and SF2 or is entirely contained within one seismic facies. SF3 units displace or are oriented parallel to the TRB (Fig. 4). The strong reflections of SF3 are often seen as downdip extensions of basin-bounding faults (Fig. 2), thus constituting deep boundaries of major structural elements and juxtaposing SF1 in the footwall with SF2 in the hanging wall. In many locations, individual SF3 units converge with the TRB (Figs. 3, 4).\nSF3 differs from the other seismic facies in terms of its reflection characteristics with strong seismic amplitudes as well as limited thickness and spatial relations to the other seismic facies units. The pronounced reflection parallelism and narrow bands of reflections that relate to prominent brittle faults as well as the boundary between SF1 and SF2, suggest SF3 represent shear zone rock fabrics. This agrees with observations in previous publications from the North Sea (Fazlikhani et al., 2017 - their SF2; Lenhart et al., 2019 - their SF3; see also Phillips et al., 2016, 2019) and elsewhere (e.g. Gresseth et al., 2021 - their SF3; Strugale et al., 2021).\n\n\n5.4\nTop reflective basement (TRB)\nThe TRB represents the boundary between upper and lower domains within crystalline basement (Fig. 2). Commonly, this surface marks the boundary between SF1 and SF2; the boundary between low-reflective and high-reflective basement rocks. In the Utsira High, it is shaped as a broad, N-S elongated dome that is shallower under the Utsira High and deeper in the adjacent Ling Depression, Stord Basin and Viking Graben (Fig. 5d). SF1 and SF2 reflections close to the TRB tend to align to it. In some locations, SF3 units and SF1 reflections sole out on the TRB. In other locations, the TRB is displaced by these units.\nAerially extensive boundaries between principal seismic facies units likely represent noteworthy tectonic boundaries. Based on its position between, and relations with reflections within SF1 and SF2, domal shape and propensity to act as a detachment surface for SF3 facies units and SF1 reflections, we interpret the TRB to represent the top of a now folded detachment zone.\n\n\n\n6\nStructural elements and their expressions\nThe Utsira High is surrounded by Paleozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary basins (Fig. 1). These basins record several episodes of crustal extension that manifest as thick sedimentary growth packages related to steeply dipping normal faults. East of the Utsira High, the Stord Basin contains chiefly Permo-Triassic rift deposits. West of the Utsira High is the Viking Graben, containing a thick Jurassic-Cretaceous sedimentary package that expands its thickness towards the Viking Graben Boundary Fault. This fault separates the Viking Graben from the East Shetland Platform. In the continuation, we start with the Sele High, which offers the most complete stratigraphic succession.\n\n6.1\nSele High\nThe Sele High is a prominent basement culmination south of the Ling Depression, southeast of the Utsira High. It offers a comprehensive stratigraphy with distinct unconformities that form a framework for correlations to adjacent regions with incomplete successions. Several unconformities are observed in the deep stratigraphic section (Fig. 1); a) the top basement unconformity, which is peneplained in some areas while displaying a distinctly alpine topography elsewhere, b) erosional truncation of strata that pre-date the Permian (Devonian\/Carboniferous?) and c) the pre-Rotliegendes (Saalian) unconformity. The seismic facies of basement rocks within the Sele High is similar to the SF1 of the Utsira High with its transparent, low-amplitude, high-frequency reflective pattern.\n\n\n6.2\nLing depression to southern Utsira High\nThe southern slope of the Utsira High steepens into the Ling Depression (Fig. 1, 5c). Control on deep seismic facies becomes progressively difficult southwards because of a) the increasing depth of the basement-cover contact and b) the presence of a complexly structured and strongly reflective package of Late Permian Zechstein evaporites. High on the Utsira High-Ling Depression slope, where only a modest thickness of evaporites are present, a series of northwest-facing normal faults are observed. These listric faults bound depocenters that contain pre-Permian sedimentary successions and have a common detachment in SF1 basement rocks at approximately 4\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 6). This sub-horizontal detachment consists of a small group of similarly dipping reflections. The faults are corrugated with corrugation axes striking SW-NE. Corrugation fold wavelengths vary from ~1\u20135\u00a0km near fault \u201ca\u201d to ~6.5\u00a0km for fault \u201cb\u201d (Fig. 6).\n\n\n6.3\nUtsira High\nThe Utsira High is a basement high containing eroded remnants of Paleozoic-Mesozoic extensional basins (Figs. 3, 4, 5). The high is onlapped by Paleozoic to Cenozoic deposits while the perched basins contain Paleozoic to Upper Jurassic sediments (Halland et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015). In seismic data, basement rocks within the Utsira High display three distinctly different seismic facies as described in the previous chapter. SF1 forms the depositional substrate for strata onlapping the high, with TRB along the boundary between SF1 and SF2. Some basin-bounding steep faults penetrate deeply into basement and displace the TRB (Fig. 4a); however, most basin-bounding faults sole out in various levels within basement rocks, most notably in the TRB. On the west flank of the Utsira High, faults that bound half grabens sole out on this surface (Fig. 3a, c). Similarly, on the east flank of the Utsira High, the deep part of the boundary fault to the Stord Basin sole out in the E-dipping TRB surface (Fig. 4a, b, 7b). Along the southern Utsira High, however, half-graben boundary faults sole out in a common detachment that is fully contained in the upper basement unit (SF1) (Fig. 6). Overall, the TRB surface forms a dome underneath the Utsira High with a roughly N-S elongated crest as shown in Fig. 5. On a smaller scale, the dome is separated in at least two segments: a southern segment where the Utsira High is widest (~70\u201380\u00a0km) and a central narrower segment (~40\u00a0km). These segments are separated by a pronounced depression (Fig. 5d) that is roughly on trend with the Hardangerfjord Shear Zone (HSZ) that traces the southern extremity of the Stord Basin (Fig. 7a).\nThe TRB is folded about axes that strike E-W to NE-SW with wavelengths between 5 and 25\u00a0km (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 7). Folds are interpreted as corrugations on the detachment zone, and their long axes are assumed to be aligned according to the related tectonic regime. Hence, tectonic transport in this detachment zone likely occurred along axes oriented E-W to NE-SW (Fig. 7). Such transport-parallel folds, or corrugations, are well expressed in West Norway (Braathen et al., 2004; Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001), where they appear within and below the major extensional detachments that record >50\u00a0km displacement. Corrugation axes and stretching lineations gradually rotate from E-W orientation to NE-SW trending towards the major M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Complex further north (Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001). Similarly, on the east flank of the Utsira High, the corrugation axes on the TRB surface change orientation from ~NE strike in the north to ~E strike near the extrapolated Hardangerfjord Shear Zone (Fig. 7a).\n\n\n6.4\nUtsira Shear Zone\nThe east-dipping Utsira Shear Zone is seen as a narrow SF3 rock body that forms the eastern boundary of the deep part of the Utsira High, demarcating the border to the Stord Basin, which contains a thick, predominantly Permo-Triassic sedimentary succession (Fig. 4). Updip, the shear zone grades into a brittle fault system that, depending on location, downthrows the top-basement surface 1\u20132\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 3) or approximately 2\u00a0km (Fig. 8d). Downdip, the shear zone converges with the east-dipping TRB surface, where it forms an SF3 upper boundary to SF2 S\u2013C structures (Fig. 3c, 7b, 8b). We see the corrugation folds on the TRB as closely related to the Utsira Shear Zone.\n\n\n6.5\nViking Graben\nThe Viking Graben is here considered a half-graben basin where a thick sedimentary succession, primarily consisting of Mesozoic sediments, are banked onto the Viking Graben Boundary Fault, on which we expand below. The eastern part of the Viking Graben coincides with the west Utsira flank, which is characterized by a basement-cover contact that becomes progressively steeper towards the west, in a dipslope that ultimately becomes truncated by the boundary fault (Fig. 3). Progressively older strata onlap the granitic basement westwards down the dipslope. These strata range in age from Paleogene near the peneplained top of central Utsira High to Permian and likely older Paleozoic strata further west (Fig. 8). The dipslope hosts Late Permian evaporites as manifested by diapiric structures (Fig. 3). These and older strata are contained within rotated half-graben basins bounded by rotated east-dipping normal faults. Noticeably, restoration juxtaposes the basal half-graben fill with Devonian packages of the Shetland Platform (see below). Several angular unconformities have been mapped on the west Utsira Flank; in addition to the top-basement unconformity there is an angular unconformity between highly compacted coarse clastic units on basement, and overlying mainly moderately lithified sandstones. This assemblage is separated by a composite angular unconformity from easterly to northerly onlapping Jurassic and Cretaceous to Paleogene units (Durand et al., 2020).\n\n\n6.6\nViking Graben Boundary Fault\nThe Viking Graben Boundary Fault is a large-magnitude listric normal fault that constitutes the boundary between the East Shetland Platform and the Viking Graben, dissecting much of the 9\u00a0s seismic sections used for this study. On certain seismic lines, steep reflections some distance into the footwall offset a reflective surface within seismically transparent basement rocks (Fig. 3a). Presumably, the offset reflection represents the interface between Devonian sedimentary units and crystalline basement. The deep part of the boundary fault, from 6.3 to 9\u00a0s TWT (~9\u201325\u00a0km), is slightly more gently dipping (Fig. 8), less so in depth-converted data (see below). The upper part of the Viking Graben Boundary Fault juxtaposes a footwall of SF1 crystalline basement hosting Devonian sedimentary units with a hanging wall of Jurassic to Cretaceous sedimentary packages, suggesting a minimum fault throw of 3\u00a0s TWT \/ 5\u00a0km (Fig. 8). The fault tips out in Cretaceous strata at approximately 2\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 3). SF3 basement rocks are identified in the immediate footwall of the Viking Graben Boundary Fault. A relation between the fault and shear zone is indicated by similarly east-dipping SF3 fabric and fault reflection. Top-E extensional kinematics can be interpreted from S\u2013C structures within the SF3 fabric (Fig. 3b).\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\nInterpretations of basement structures of the Utsira High region expands on previously published work that address both the North Sea rift system and seismic facies of basement rocks (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Fossen and Hurich, 2005; Gresseth et al., 2021; Lenhart et al., 2019; Peron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2020; Phillips et al., 2016, 2019; Strugale et al., 2021; Torvela et al., 2013; Wiest et al., 2020). We show the relationships between basins, major faults and shear zones, warped intra-basement fabric and kinematic indicators in crystalline basement. In the following, we will discuss the post-Caledonian structural development of the greater Utsira High region seen in the light of these novel observations.\n\n7.1\nUtsira High metamorphic core complex\nImproved deep seismic imaging of the Utsira High has allowed for mapping of intra-basement reflections and subdivision of basement into seismic facies. Crudely put, the crystalline basement consists of an upper, low-reflective SF1 unit and a lower, medium-to-high-reflective SF2 unit. The TRB surface forms the boundary between the two units and is dome-shaped under the Utsira High. Additionally, narrow bands of SF3 that are interpreted as shear zones either cross-cut reflections in both the other units, are contained within the upper unit, or display a relationship with the other units where SF1 and\/or SF2 reflections converge with SF3 reflections. SF3 seismic units either 1) forms the downdip continuation of brittle, basin-bounding faults, 2) forms the d\u00e9collement onto which these faults sole, and\/or 3) traces the TRB surface, suggesting this surface represent a detachment.\nExhumation of metamorphic core complexes during extensional collapse of the Caledonides has been established for the Norwegian continental shelf (Gresseth et al., 2021; Henstra and Rotevatn, 2014; Osmundsen et al., 2021), the onshore-offshore transition (Lenhart et al., 2019; Wiest et al., 2020) and onshore West Norway (Braathen et al., 2000; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Wiest et al., 2020). It has been speculated that the Utsira High represents a metamorphic core complex exhumed in the footwall of the Utsira Shear Zone (Phillips et al., 2019). We substantiate the Utsira High as a metamorphic core complex, with a proposed structural development of the high and adjacent areas outlined in Figs. 9 and 10\n\n. The former summarizes observations made in a wide, approximately E-W oriented corridor across the Utsira High, while the latter presents a tentative chronology of tectonic events from Devonian to Permian based on the discussion below. The latter (Fig. 10) does not include Permo-Triassic and Jurassic-Cretaceous rift events, which would have been represented by steps 5 and 6 in the figure, respectively. We base our interpretations on these observations:\n\n1.\nThe TRB surface (detachment) is dome-shaped and has been dome-shaped at least since before Jurassic-Cretaceous rifting, as evidenced by our structural restoration of the Viking Graben Boundary Fault (Fig. 8).\n\n\n2.\nThere is significant and long-lived crustal uplift centered around the Utsira High. This is suggested by thinning of the upper basement unit (SF1) (Fig. 5e) and by non-deposition and\/or erosion of significant parts of the Paleozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary section as compared to, for instance, the Sele High, which preserves a thick pre-Permian sedimentary section (Fig. 1d). Further, contrary to the Utsira High, an alpine topography of the Top Basement surface is preserved in the Sele High, consistent with burial instead of exposure with subsequent peneplanation.\n\n\n3.\nSeismic fabrics of SF1 and SF2 immediately above and below the TRB, respectively, show morphological similarities and tend to rotate into parallelism with this surface, indicating its significance as a major detachment\/shear zone (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Lister and Davis, 1989). Furthermore, many faults and shear zones (SF3) root in the TRB (Figs. 3, 4). We interpret the TRB as a warped detachment.\n\n\n4.\nIn the southern Utsira High, an intra-SF1 detachment, which appears as a ramp-flat-ramp system, defines a lower boundary of steep pre-Permian growth-faults (Compare Fig. 4a with 4b and 4c). A location above maximum upwards migration of lower-middle crust suggests that rapid uplift of hot crust temporarily shifted the brittle-ductile transition upwards, before relocating to margins of the dome.\n\n\n\nExpected rapid exhumation of the Utsira High metamorphic core complex, similar to Devonian basement domes of mainland Norway (Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Engvik and Andersen, 2000; Terry et al., 2000; Terry and Robinson, 2003), would bring hot crust to a structurally high position towards the crest of the dome. Thermally weakened crust in higher positions can facilitate upward migration of detachments, consistent with the observation of a shallower detachment in the south flank of the Utsira High, contained entirely within the upper basement unit (SF1) (Fig. 6). Faults that sole out in this detachment bound half-grabens that contain pre-Permian sedimentary deposits (Fig. 6).\n\n\n7.2\nExtensional kinematics of the Utsira High\nCorrugations on faults rooting in the mentioned shallow detachment on the southern flank of the Utsira High indicate top-NE extensional tectonics (Fig. 6). Similarly, corrugations mapped in TRB detachment offer transport axes striking E-W to NE-SW, as identified in the eastern flank of the Utsira High, where the extensional east-dipping Utsira Shear Zone coincides with the TRB detachment. Corrugation folds oriented parallel to tectonic transport on detachments have been recognized in a variety of settings worldwide, including onshore west Norway and on the Norwegian continental shelf (Braathen et al., 2018; Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Gresseth et al., 2021; Kapp et al., 2008; Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998; Lister and Davis, 1989; Little et al., 2007; Osmundsen et al., 1998; Templeton, 2015). Taken together with the observed corrugations, we interpret tectonic transport towards the NE. However, immediately north of the Hardangerfjord Shear Zone, corrugation axes rotate and become parallel with the east-striking shear zone, suggesting it was actively exploited during exhumation of the Utsira High metamorphic core complex (Fig. 7a). Similar rotation in kinematic axes is well documented for West Norway, with a shift from E-W to NE-SW in vicinity of the M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Complex (Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001).\nAs documented, improved deep seismic imaging makes it possible to separate between rock units within the crystalline basement in the Utsira High, qualified by differing reflection patterns. Noticeably, the lower basement unit (SF2) is dominated by patterns consistent with large S\u2013C shear fabrics along the flanks of the dome, capped by the TRB surface. These simple-shear S\u2013C fabrics show opposing kinematics on the dome flanks with top-E and top-W shear on east and west flanks, respectively (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 7). Additionally, the lower basement unit (SF2) displays more symmetrical anastomosing fabrics centrally within the dome (Fig. 3, 7d). This is consistent with patterns of pure-shear strain with vertical flattening, although this fabric is overprinted by predominantly east-dipping structures in some areas (Fig. 3c). This gross pattern can be explained in several ways;\n\n1.\nContemporaneous bi-directional simple-shear in the upper crust was decoupled from the uplifting lower-middle crust that experienced a pure-shear flattening regime. This observation substantiates that initial doming, perhaps from diapiric uplift of overthickened crust, caused or was associated with bi-directional shear in shallower crust. An analogue would be the bi-directional kinematics recorded on Devonian detachments flanking basement domes in Central Norway (Braathen et al., 2000, 2002).\n\n\n2.\nInitial bi-directional shear above an uplifting flattening regime was followed by lower-middle crust rollback during a subsequent shift to top-E shear. Similarly, vertical flattening by pure shear is documented for lower-middle crustal sections below the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment Zone of Western Norway (Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Engvik and Andersen, 2000), with initial fabrics becoming uplifted and incorporated in top-W shear of the detachment (see also Fig. 9).\n\n\n\nRemnants of fault-bounded growth basins around the Utsira High generally show down-easterly kinematics with faults rooted in the TRB detachment, irrespective of position around the domal core complex. This top-easterly shear system rejuvenated the eastern flank of the dome and caused rollback in underlying units as unroofing progressed (Fig. 10). Importantly, reactivation of the TRB detachment along the eastern Utsira High endorse that S\u2013C shear fabric is best developed on the eastern dome limb (compare Fig. 7b with 7c), where the Utsira Shear Zone reactivates inherited fabrics. Models of rollback below major detachments is substantiated by Brun et al. (2018) (their fig. 11; see also Tirel et al., 2008) and corroborated in Braathen and Osmundsen (2020). Applying such models to the Utsira High, there would be westerly migration of deeper crust decoupled from an upper section experiencing top-easterly shear. Rollback kinematics with continued warping of detachments necessitate growth of new, steeper faults that either truncate or reactivate older structures (Braathen and Osmundsen, 2020; Brun et al., 2018; Lister and Davis, 1989; Miller et al., 1999; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018; Serck et al., 2021). Here, the proto-Viking Graben Boundary Fault\/shear zone truncates the TRB detachment, whereas the Utsira Shear Zone reactivates it because of its favorable orientation. A similar geometric-kinematic scenario has been described in the Snake Range of Nevada (Brun et al., 2018; Miller et al., 1999).\nThe Viking Graben Boundary Fault controls the mentioned crustal-scale rollover with a long dipslope down from the Utsira High towards the Viking Graben. Remains of fault-bounded growth basins mainly in the dipslope (e.g., prominent grabens of Solveig and Edvard Grieg fields) (Fig. 5c) are of Paleozoic age but shows local Jurassic-Cretaceous(?) reactivation (Figs. 1c, 3c). Our large-scale restoration (Fig. 8) hints at links between Devonian units of the East Shetland Platform (Patruno et al., 2019; Platt and Cartwright, 1999) and the hanging wall dipslope, suggesting deeper parts of the dipslope basins might contain remnants of Devonian depocenters. These units are significantly compacted where penetrated on the Utsira High (Durand et al., 2020), consistent with significant burial before uplift and rotation from core complex doming, with deep erosion resulting in truncation by an angular unconformity. Sandstones above the angular unconformity in deeply eroded basins on the Utsira High offer Triassic illite K\u2013Ar ages (Fredin et al., 2017). Signs of salt diapirism in the dipslope towards the Viking Graben suggests that accommodation was available for deposition of Late Permian evaporites, signaling Permian (re)activation of faults (Fig. 8c, d). A strong affiliation between the (proto-)Viking Graben Boundary Fault system and mapped evaporites substantiate this (Fig. 5b). Combined, these observations point towards Permo-Triassic fault activity that is preserved in the west and south flanks of the Utsira High. A tectonic evolution for the Sele High prior to Permo-Triassic rifting is suggested by the conserved, comprehensive Paleozoic stratigraphy and resolvable unconformities within the high: 1) Devonian Top basement unconformity, albeit with substantially less erosion than the peneplained Utsira High Top basement surface (Fig. 1d). 2) Devono-Carboniferous or intra-Carboniferous unconformity (not presented herein), indicating either that Devonian collapse tectonics persisted into the Carboniferous or a separate Carboniferous rift event. 3) The Saalian\/sub-Rotliegendes unconformity (Fig. 1d), commonly ascribed to deformation related to the Variscan Orogeny (e.g. Glennie, 1998).\nDevonian to Carboniferous shear zone-related unroofing events have been documented for West Norway (Eide et al., 1999) and later in Central Norway (Eide et al., 2002). This indicates a prolonged extensional episode that might have been overlooked in other studies concerning post-Caledonian extensional tectonics and has since received support (Templeton, 2015). Moreover, Kalani et al. (2020) argue for a Devonian to early Carboniferous extensional phase in the Egersund Basin, southeast of the Sele High (location in Fig. 1b), which by proximity suggests that unconformity 2) in the pre-Permian Sele High succession (described above) belongs to the same extensional phase. Heeremans and Faleide (2004) suggests the North Sea and Skagerrak Sea between Norway and Denmark is affected by late Carboniferous to Permian extensional tectonism, hence separated in time from Caledonian collapse tectonics that have been particularly well documented onshore west Norway (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Wiest et al., 2020). For the Utsira High, we open the door for extending the phase of Caledonian collapse-related tectonics into the Carboniferous based on the 1) close relationship between pre-Permian basin bounding faults and major detachments that exhume within the Utsira High metamorphic core complex, and 2) strong similarities between detachment systems of our study area and detachment systems onshore west Norway (Eide et al., 1999; Templeton, 2015). A possible separate Carboniferous rift event cannot be resolved for the Utsira High based on our current dataset. Furthermore, the sub-Rotliegendes unconformity, as observed in the southern Utsira High (Fig. 6), is clearly affiliated with dome exhumation-related extensional faults as opposed to Variscan compressional tectonics. Hence, the Utsira High was either unaffected by Variscan tectonics or the metamorphic core complex exhumation provided a structural signature strong enough to render any Variscan tectonic features unresolvable.\n\n\n7.3\nJurassic-Cretaceous crustal-scale rollover\nThe Viking Graben Boundary Fault (Fig. 1c) separates the East Shetland Platform from the western dipslope of the Utsira High. Although seismic facies interpretations of East Shetland Platform basement rocks are challenging, seismic sections crossing the major fault indicate similar time thickness of the upper basement unit (SF1) on either side of the fault (Figs. 1c, 3). This observation emphasizes that the footwall and hanging wall have a shared tectonic history prior to major displacement on the Viking Graben Boundary Fault, as discussed above. In deeper parts of the Viking Graben, a thick Jurassic-Cretaceous growth wedge (Fig. 1c) above the Mid Jurassic surface rest on assumed Permo-Triassic and likely older Paleozoic growth-basin(s). The distribution of Late Permian Zechstein evaporites (Fig. 5b) strongly suggest a Permo-Triassic precursor to the Viking Graben Boundary Fault, which was reactivated and accumulated substantially more throw during the Jurassic-Cretaceous rift phase, when the Viking Graben became the main structural depression of the northern North Sea rift system.\nThe Top basement surface is relatively flat-lying on the Utsira High and of similar depth as the East Shetland Platform. It becomes progressively steeper as it rolls from the Utsira High into the Viking Graben and the Viking Graben Boundary Fault. This fault appears listric in TWT data, becoming lower-angled as it extends out of the seismic sections at 9\u00a0s TWT. In the depth-stretched seismic section, however, the listric nature of the fault is less convincing (Fig. 8d). Nevertheless, the shape of the dipslope from the Utsira High into Viking Graben suggest formation of a crustal-scale rollover, thereby substantiating a deep flat-lying detachment located below our current seismic coverage (> 9\u00a0s TWT), changing from ramp to flat approximately underneath the western extreme of the peneplained Utsira High as seen in e.g. Fig. 3b.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThis study of the Utsira High region along the southeastern margin of Viking Graben (North Sea) uses a large database long-offset, deep recording (9\u00a0s TWT) seismic data with substantially improved deep seismic imaging to outline the crustal scale structure and the regional tectonic evolution.\n\n1.\nDevonian (to Carboniferous) isostatic doming of overthickened crust caused uplift and erosion of basins and the nappe stack above a crustal rollback system during formation of the semi-symmetrical Utsira High metamorphic core complex. Dome-internal fabrics display vertical flattening kinematics below bi-directional shear systems evident by opposing shear-fabric kinematics on eastern and western flanks of the Utsira High.\n\n\n2.\nA major detachment boundary between upper and lower plate strain regimes coincide with upper low-reflective basement units (granites) above strongly reflective assemblages (Caledonian nappes). Temporal shifts in active detachment levels are ascribed to thermal weakening and strengthening. Detachments host tectonic transport-parallel corrugations that strike E-W to NE-SW, with top-easterly kinematics consistent with growth-fault basins on top of basement.\n\n\n3.\nRejuvenation of older faults and basins are noticeable for the Permo-Triassic rift episode. The prominent Utsira Shear Zone soles out in an older, rotated shear zone along the east flank of the Utsira High, enhancing top-E shear fabrics from preceding extensional phases.\n\n\n4.\nFor the Jurassic-Cretaceous rift episode, major rift-faulting mainly on the Viking Graben Boundary Fault is connected to thick growth wedges in the Viking Graben. This faulting establishes a crustal-scale rollover from the Utsira High downslope into the Viking Graben.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nChristopher S\u00e6b\u00f8 Serck: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization.

Paleostress determinations on brittle structures suggest that at least three stress regimes have affected the Eastern Cordillera since the Late Cretaceous (e.g., Cort\u00e9s et al., 2005).\nThe Eastern Cordillera is an inverted rift system (Colletta et al., 1990; Dengo and Covey, 1993; Cooper et al., 1995; Cort\u00e9s et al., 2005; Sarmiento-Rojas et al., 2006; Bayona et al., 2008; Mora et al., 2008, 2010, 2013, 2015). Faults that have experienced tectonic inversion are localized along both flanks of the Eastern Cordillera; the Guaicaramo Fault system on the eastern flank and the La Salina Fault system on the western flank (e.g., Cooper et al., 1995; Mora et al., 2013). In the northern Eastern Cordillera, faults that have experienced inversion (dip slip displacement >\u00a0>\u00a0strike slip) include the Boyac\u00e1, Soapaga, and Su\u00e1rez faults (Cooper et al., 1995; Hermeston and Nem\u010dok, 2013; Kammer and Sanchez, 2006; Mora et al., 2013; Caballero et al., 2013; Tes\u00f3n et al., 2013) (Fig. 1). These structures control the regional trend of the Eastern Cordillera, and in Mesozoic time controlled the deposition of graben-filling sedimentary sequences, some reaching a thickness of about five km (Kammer and Sanchez, 2006; Bayona et al., 2020b).\nStrike-slip displacements are also linked to the evolution of the Eastern Cordillera, including the formation of the Magdalena Valley Basin by the right-lateral Ibague fault (Acosta et al., 2004; Montes et al., 2005; Kammer, 1999; Velandia et al., 2005; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). Displacement along the left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault controlled vertical uplift of the Santander Massif since the Eocene (Velandia, 2017; Velandia et al., 2020; Velandia and Berm\u00fadez, 2018; Siravo et al., 2019; Amaya-Ferreira et al., 2020) with slip-rates in the Neogene estimated to be ~3\u00a0mm\/yr (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2015). According to Velandia (2017) and Velandia et al. (2020), normal faults in the Santander Massif experienced a positive inversion during the Neogene as a transpressive regime propagated into the Santander Massif in response to transpressional displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 1). The metamorphic and igneous rock-cored Santander Massif is a tectonic element that exposes several structural transitions with surrounding areas: to the north with the Perij\u00e1 Range and Cesar Basin, to the east with the M\u00e9rida Andes and Catatumbo Basin, to the south with the Floresta Massif and the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera, and to the west with the western foothills of the Eastern Cordillera and the northernmost segment of the Middle Magdalena Basin.\nPrevious studies had not reported whether vertical-axis rotations occurred at the boundary of the inverted northern Eastern Cordillera and wrench-dominated Santander Massif structures, and had not considered the possible implications of these rotations for the structural evolution of this complex area. Therefore, our work concentrates on the history of the inversion to a wrench-dominated deformation pattern that is documented between the Santander Massif and the axial and western structural domains of the northern Eastern Cordillera. In order to better understand how the complex structural transitional zone evolved from the Mesozoic to today, we investigate the changes in magnetic fabrics using anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and the distribution, sense, and magnitude of vertical axis rotations, inferred from paleomagnetic data, as a function of crustal shortening versus strike-slip deformation.\nPaleomagnetic and AMS techniques are used on rocks from Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous sedimentary\/volcaniclastic sequences distributed in three major study areas covering the change in structural styles from inverted to wrench-type structures (Fig. 1). These techniques supply data about magnetic fabrics, magnitudes and senses of block rotations and latitudinal translations, as other regional studies had reported in the Eastern Cordillera, Perij\u00e1 Range, and M\u00e9rida Andes (Castillo et al., 1991; Gose et al., 2003; Bayona et al., 2006, 2010; Nova et al., 2012, 2019; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014; Garc\u00eda and Jim\u00e9nez, 2016). The selected study areas include the following six localities: the NNE-trending Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1) in the axial zone of the northern Eastern Cordillera; the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2) in the western flank of the northern Eastern Cordillera; areas adjacent to the left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault zone, which from south to north are: Mesas, Bucaramanga, and southern Santander Massif (localities 3 to 5), and Aguachica (locality 6) located farther to the north at the right relay of the left-lateral Bucaramanga fault in the northern Santander Massif (Fig. 1). The first two areas in the northern Eastern Cordillera include regional reverse faults that are the product of basin inversion (Kammer and Sanchez, 2006; Tes\u00f3n et al., 2013). The other four areas are adjacent to regional wrench-dominated Bucaramanga Fault and associated structures.\nThe AMS examines strain in a wide range of rock types that have experienced differing degrees of deformation (Borradaile and Tarling, 1981; Hrouda, 1982; Borradaile, 1988, 2001; Rochette et al., 1992; Par\u00e9s and Dinar\u00e8s, 1993; Borradaile and Henry, 1997; Borradaile and Jackson, 2004). In orogens that have experienced tectonic inversion (e.g., Eastern Cordillera), a pre-inversion magnetic fabric may be preserved (e.g., Soto et al., 2007), or a new, post-inversion magnetic fabric formed (e.g., Oliva-Urcia et al., 2010). The magnitude and sense of vertical-axis rotations of crustal blocks can often be linked to strike-slip displacement (Ron et al., 1984; Sonder et al., 1994; Piper et al., 1997; Sussman et al., 2004; Randall et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2004, 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 2014). Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al. (2014) demonstrated that the distribution and magnitude of crustal block rotations are useful to explain strike-slip fault systems in the context of regional kinematic models. Inclination data, if properly corrected for any compaction-related shallowing, allow the estimation of the paleolatitude location of study areas at the time of remanence acquisition.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting, jurassic stratigraphy and previous paleomagnetic studies\n\n2.1\nRegional tectonic evolution of the northern Andes\nThe northern Andes is composed, in the south, of the Western, Central, and Eastern cordilleras, and the Eastern Cordillera changes northward into the Santander Massif, M\u00e9rida Andes, and Perij\u00e1 Range (Fig. 1). The Western and Central Cordilleras are separated by the intermontane Cauca-Pat\u00eda Basin, and the Central and Eastern cordilleras are separated by the intermontane Magdalena Valley Basin (Fig. 1). The Santander Massif is surrounded by the northern Middle Magdalena Valley to the west and the Catatumbo Basin and the southwestern termination of the M\u00e9rida Andes to the east (Fig. 1).\nContinuous subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath the northwest part of the South American Plate has been ongoing since the late Paleozoic (Case et al., 1990; Restrepo-Pace, 1995; Cediel et al., 2003). Early to Middle Jurassic extensional tectonism was related to the separation of the North and South America Plates, the rotation of the Yucat\u00e1n Block, and seafloor spreading in the proto\u2013Caribbean Ocean. During this period, transtensional basins were filled with marine sediments, followed by the deposition of km-thick volcaniclastic deposits (represented by the Bocas, Jord\u00e1n, and Nore\u00e1n formations) (Bayona et al., 2020b) (Fig. 2\n). After the cessation of volcanism and a period of deformation, another extensional regime operated during the Late Jurassic, affecting the internal part of the Santander Massif, Arcabuco and Los Yarigu\u00edes extensional basins, presently in the northern Eastern Cordillera. These Late Jurassic extensional basins are characterized by a record of the km-thick continental terrigenous deposits (Gir\u00f3n Group), and these deposits overlie in angular unconformity Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic rocks (Bayona et al., 2020b).\nA different extensional basin configuration developed during the Early Cretaceous, with two broad half-graben basins located to the east of the present Central Cordillera: the Tablazo-Magdalena sub-basin to the west and the Cocuy sub-basin to the east. These basins were separated by a horst structure, the Floresta-Santander high (Fabre, 1987; Cooper et al., 1995; Sarmiento-Rojas et al., 2006) (Fig. 2). Syn-rift Lower Cretaceous sedimentary successions in these two half-graben basins consist of marine to transitional sequences. Albian to Turonian age marginal to marine sedimentary rocks covered uniformly these two basins and the Floresta-Santander high, following a post-rift stage of tectonic subsidence regime (Cooper et al., 1995; Sarmiento-Rojas et al., 2006).\nAccretion of oceanic volcanic rocks and the subduction of the Caribbean plate caused the uplift of the Central Cordillera-Santa Marta Massif blocks since late Campanian time (Gomez et al., 2003; Bayona et al., 2013; Montes et al., 2019). To the east, the reactivation of Cretaceous age extensional structures as inverted, reverse fault structures since latest Cretaceous time was the dominant mechanism that formed syn-orogenic basins that were filled with continental deposits (Montes et al., 2003; Cort\u00e9s et al., 2006; Bayona et al., 2013; Reyes-Harker et al., 2015). Structural blocks within the Arcabuco and Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinoria, the Santander Massif and paleo-Central Cordillera supplied sediments to adjacent basins (Parra et al., 2012; Caballero et al., 2013; Bayona et al., 2020a). During the early Oligocene, inversion of pre-existing normal faults resulted in the exhumation of regional blocks along several structures in both flanks of the Eastern Cordillera (Colletta et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1995; Mora et al., 2006, 2008, 2010), the Santander Massif (Ross et al., 2009; Velandia, 2017; Siravo et al., 2018, 2019) and M\u00e9rida Andes (Berm\u00fadez et al., 2010). Continuous subduction of the Caribe (north of Panama arc) and later Nazca plate (south of Panama arc) to the west since the Oligocene and the collision of the Panam\u00e1 arc with northwest South America during the middle to late Miocene are interpreted as the mechanisms that drove shortening deformation in the Eastern Cordillera (Duque-Caro, 1990; Taboada et al., 2000; Montes et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.2\nStructural styles of selected study areas\nThe northern segment of the Eastern Cordillera is strongly asymmetric, with a gentle and wide western flank, a wide axial zone with exposure of basement rocks in the Floresta Massif region, and a steep and short eastern flank (Mora et al., 2006; Siravo et al., 2018, 2019). Neogene deformation in this segment is related to inverted and other compressional structures presently located toward the eastern and western foothills (Colletta et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1995; Mora et al., 2006, 2009; Horton et al., 2010; Tes\u00f3n et al., 2013; Caballero et al., 2013; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). According to Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014), the Eastern Cordillera has not experienced appreciable vertical axis rotation (less than 20 degrees), and oblique, transpressional shortening was partitioned into pure dip-slip shear in both frontal thrust sheets and right-lateral strike-slip displacement in the axial part of the Eastern Cordillera (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). Recent GPS studies document the NE-directed tectonic transport of several blocks of the northern Andes (Mora-P\u00e1ez et al., 2019, 2020), and this component of deformation is not considered in the shortening estimates based on orthogonal cross-sections.\nFor structures in the Santander Massif, left lateral displacements are related to deformation along the active Bucaramanga Fault (Paris et al., 2000; Diederix et al., 2009; Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2012; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2015; Siravo et al., 2018; Velandia and Berm\u00fadez, 2018; Velandia et al., 2020) with displacements >45\u00a0km (Toro, 1990). These NE-SW striking transverse faults with right-lateral displacement are linked to the Bucaramanga Fault, defining a regional domino-style block geometry (Velandia, 2017) (Fig. 1). Based on field data, Cu\u00e9llar et al. (2012) proposed that NE-SW oriented right-lateral faults displace the northern segment of the Bucaramanga Fault. The right relay of the Bucaramanga Fault to the Guamalito Fault (Velandia et al., 2020) in the Aguachica locality marks the transition to the Perij\u00e1 Range to the north. The rapid phase of exhumation and vertical uplift of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif began in the last 10\u00a0Ma and was caused by the transition from regular to flat-slab subduction (Siravo et al., 2019). Neogene exhumation events are identified in the Santander Massif (Amaya et al., 2017; van der Lelij et al., 2016; Siravo et al., 2019; Amaya-Ferreira et al., 2020), and they are interpreted as a vertical component of displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault.\n\n\n2.3\nJurassic stratigraphy in the Northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif, and tectonic models for the Jurassic\nJurassic sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks in the northern Eastern Cordillera are exposed in three areas, all of which show an eastward decrease in thickness and important variations in lithologic associations (see summary and references in Velandia and Berm\u00fadez, 2018; Bayona et al., 2020b and Osorio-Afanador and Velandia, 2021).\nIn the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera, exposures of Jurassic rocks are at the Arcabuco anticlinorium and the Floresta Massif. In the Arcabuco anticlinorium, continental sandstones and mudstones of the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic Palermo and Montebel formations unconformably overlie metamorphosed mid-Paleozoic rocks. Middle Jurassic continental volcaniclastic rocks of the La Rusia Formation overlie the Lower Jurassic succession. The Upper Jurassic-lowermost Cretaceous succession corresponds to fluvial-marginal sediments of Arcabuco Formation (Fig. 2); the full thickness of Jurassic rocks in the Arcabuco anticlinorium is <3kms. In the Floresta Massif, the thin (<1\u00a0km) continental fluvial deposits of the Upper Jurassic unconformably overlie metamorphosed mid-Paleozoic rocks. To the south of the Floresta Massif, the Lower Cretaceous rocks rest unconformably upon Paleozoic rocks.\nThe Jurassic succession to the east and west of the Bucaramanga Fault varies mainly in thickness and the types of rocks below the unconformity. In the Mesas-Bucaramanga localities, to the west of the Bucaramanga Fault, volcaniclastic red beds of the Lower Jurassic Jord\u00e1n Formation overlie unconformably the Upper Triassic Bocas Formation and Paleozoic rocks (Osorio-Afanador and Velandia, 2021). The Upper Jurassic-lowermost Cretaceous Gir\u00f3n Group rests in angular unconformity (<15\u00b0) upon the Jord\u00e1n Formation. The westernmost area corresponds to the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium at the western flank of the northern Eastern Cordillera, where the Upper Jurassic-lowermost Cretaceous fluvial Gir\u00f3n Group has a thickness variable (hundreds of m to ~4\u00a0km) and changes across transversal faults. In the Santander Massif, to the east of Bucaramanga Fault, Jurassic strata are restricted to small and segmented basins with thickness\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0km, identified units correspond to Bocas, Jord\u00e1n and Gir\u00f3n, and Jurassic strata that overlie metamorphic-igneous basement rocks (Fig. 2). Farther to the north, in a right relay of the Bucaramanga Fault to the Guamalito Fault, Lower Jurassic volcaniclastic rocks of the Nore\u00e1n Formation rest unconformably upon mid-Paleozoic metamorphic rocks, and they may reach up to 3\u00a0km in thickness (Velandia, 2017).\nFather to the west in the subsurface of the Magdalena Valley, Sarmiento (2011) compiled information from several industry studies that clearly illustrates deformation of pre-middle Eocene age forming several paleohighs with an average NE-SW orientation that more likely correspond to the reactivation of former Mesozoic structures. On its southern and eastern segments are reported fluvial deposits of the Upper Jurassic- Lower Cretaceous Gir\u00f3n Group, whereas on its northern and western segment, the Jurassic sequence consists of the volcano-clastic deposits of the Lower Jurassic Nore\u00e1n Formation (Bayona et al., 2020).\nThree tectonic models for the Triassic \u2013 Jurassic evolution of the NW corner of Gondwana have been proposed (see review in Bayona et al., 2020b). The first model involves a set of Jurassic intracontinental rifts as a result of extensional tectonism (Mojica and Kammer, 1995; Cediel et al., 2003). A second model considers this area to have been a continental margin with adjacent magmatic arcs that resulted from subduction\u2013zone migration (e. g., Cochrane et al., 2014; Spikings et al., 2015, Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2018). A third model also considers subduction to the west, but the angle of convergence between the ancient Pacific lithosphere and western Gondwana lithosphere fragments changed during the Jurassic, controlling the formation and location of magmatic arcs, the decrease of magmatic activity in the middle Jurassic, and the translations of para\u2013autochthonous terranes during the Late Jurassic (Bayona et al., 2006, 2010; Toussaint, 1995).\n\n\n2.4\nPrevious paleomagnetic investigations in the Eastern Cordillera, Santander Massif, Perij\u00e1 Range and Guajira blocks\nEarly paleomagnetic studies in northwest South America focused on Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks exposed in the Bucaramanga area (Creer et al., 1970), the Santander Massif (Hargraves et al., 1984), and the Perij\u00e1 Range (Maze and Hargraves, 1984) (Fig. 1). More recent paleomagnetic studies have uncovered characteristic remanent magnetization components in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks that have permitted the documentation of paleolatitudinal translations and vertical-axis rotations. According to Castillo et al. (1991), the Middle Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous strata in the M\u00e9rida Andes reveal no significant palaeolatitudinal translations. Paleomagnetic results from Lower Jurassic rocks exposed in the Mesas- Bucaramanga localities (Jord\u00e1n Formation; Bayona et al., 2006) and the Santa Marta Massif (in volcanic units; Bayona et al., 2010) suggest that these blocks were translated from the southern hemisphere (~10\u00b0S) to near-equatorial latitudes. According to Bayona et al. (2006), the Upper Jurassic- Lower Cretaceous strata in the Mesas-Bucaramanga area and Floresta Massif were always located at shallow northern hemisphere latitudes. Although paleomagnetic results from these studies suggest latitudinal discordancy based on a comparison of observed inclination data with respect to expected directions based on reference paleomagnetic data for South America, these results did not consider inclination shallowing due to sediment compaction and related diagenetic processes.\nIn the Perij\u00e1 Range, Gose et al. (2003) and Nova et al. (2012) reported paleomagnetic results from Jurassic (La Quinta Formation) and Cretaceous (Rionegro Formation) strata. These studies proposed post-Eocene ~40 to 50\u00b0 CW rotation of this general area (Fig. 1), with no paleolatitudinal translations. To the north of the Oca Fault (Fig. 1), Nova et al. (2019) reported paleomagnetic results from Jurassic rocks in the Guajira block, where 70-90o clockwise rotations have been proposed for this block. However, large uncertainties in the reported paleomagnetic data preclude a clear estimation of paleolatitudinal translation; the authors propose a tectonic evolution of the Guajira block with the conjugate Mexican margin to the north.\n\nJim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) reported magnetostratigraphic data from the Gir\u00f3n Group in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium and inferred an age of deposition between early Kimmeridgian and Valanginian (~157 to 139\u00a0Ma). Using an f factor of 0.6 to correct the inclination data of the Gir\u00f3n Group strata, Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) proposed that the crustal elements were located in the northern hemisphere at a latitude of ~7\u00b0. Since the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time, the magnitude of latitudinal translation decreased, and only minor northward translations occurred. According to Bayona et al. (2006), in the Mesa area, local counterclockwise (CCW) rotations of some 90\u00b0 of fault-bounded blocks occurred before the syn-extensional deposition of Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sequences. According to Bayona et al. (2006) farther north of Bucaramanga, the rotations are less significant.\nAccording to Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014) the Miocene deformation event in the Eastern Cordillera was not associated with appreciable vertical axis rotation, and oblique transpressional shortening was partitioned into pure dip-slip shear in both frontal thrust sheets and right-lateral strike-slip faults, in the axial part of the Eastern Cordillera. Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) report data consistent with CW rotations of 45\u00b0 in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, related to Neogene strike-slip displacement along both regional and local faults (Fig. 1). Garc\u00eda and Jim\u00e9nez (2016) report paleomagnetic results from Upper Cretaceous marine mudstones and Paleogene continental sandstones in the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera and suggest moderate CW rotations up to 20o and CCW rotations of 28o in response to strike-slip displacement along transverse faults. The noncoaxial strain resulted in the development of steep magnetic fabric lineations in Cretaceous to Miocene sedimentary rocks, and these lineations are oblique to the regional trend of the Eastern Cordillera (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). This relationship could imply that reactivation of master normal faults within the Eastern Cordillera occurred under simple or sub-simple shear. Other AMS data from Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene sedimentary rocks in the Zipaquir\u00e1 Anticline located in the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera show either magnetic lineations that are parallel to the structural grain of the Eastern Cordillera or the preservation of sedimentary magnetic fabrics in the back limb of the Zipaquir\u00e1 Anticline (Garc\u00eda and Jim\u00e9nez, 2016).\n\nJim\u00e9nez et al. (2015) reported magnetostratigraphic data from the Quaternary Bucaramanga alluvial fan deposits and demonstrated that these were deposited across the ca. 778\u00a0ka Matuyama to Brunhes, chron transition and they used this information to estimate a\u00a0~\u00a03\u00a0mm\/yr slip rate for the Bucaramanga Fault.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nFieldwork\nWe carried out a sampling campaign on hematitic mudstones and silty fine sandstones of the Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous rocks of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif (Figs. 1 and 2). We sampled a total of 47 sites (~550 samples cores) distributed at six localities: (locality 1) eleven sites at both flanks of the Arcabuco anticlinorium (sites AR, AM, AP, prefixes) (supplementary material 1), (locality 2) seven sites at the eastern flank of Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (sites ZG and ZLS) (supplementary material 2), (locality 3) eleven sites at Mesas locality (sites SJ and PJ) (supplementary material 2), (locality 4) six sites at the Bucaramanga locality (sites B and G) (supplementary material 2), (locality 5) seven sites at the southern Santander Massif to the east of Bucaramanga fault (sites MJ, JD, and S) (supplementary material 2), and (locality 6) five sites on the right relay of the Bucaramanga Fault farther north in Aguachica, northern Santander Massif (sites N1 to N5) (supplementary material 3). At each site, we collected 10\u201314 cores (12 on average), spaced at least two exposures and multiple beds to try to average out the paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field.\nSamples as drilled cores were obtained by using a portable gas-powered drill cooled by water and oriented in situ with a corrected magnetic compass (between \u22126 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a08\u00b0 according to the World Magnetic Model and calculated using the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center web page; http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/geomag-web\/). After field sampling, cores were cut into standard specimens of ~2.2\u00a0cm in length and 2.5\u00a0cm in diameter using a non-magnetic bronze saw.\n\n\n3.2\nMagnetic mineralogy experiments\nRock magnetic experiments were conducted to identify the main magnetization carriers. Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition and backfield demagnetization, thermal demagnetization of three-component isothermal remanent magnetization (TM-IRM) (Lowrie, 1990), and thermomagnetic (bulk susceptibility versus temperature) curves were obtained. For the IRM acquisition experiments, representative specimens were subjected to at least 25 sequential steps from 10 to 2800 mT, and for backfield demagnetization, at least 12 sequence steps from 10 to 700 mT. DC fields were applied using an IM-10-30 pulse magnetizer (ASC Scientific). Coercivity spectra from IRM acquisition curves were evaluated using the MaxUnmix software (Maxbauer et al., 2016). For TM-IRM, the representative specimens were magnetized in an IM-10-30 impulse magnetizer (ASC Scientific), and three fields were applied to the z, y, and x, axes (2.7, 0.6, and 0.12\u00a0T, respectively). Thermal demagnetization was carried out with a TD 48 (ASC Scientific) thermal unit in 17 steps between 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 700\u00a0\u00b0C. In both IRM and TM-IRM experiments, after each step, the remanence was measured with a JR6-A Dual Speed Spinner Magnetometer (AGICO Inc.). Thermomagnetic curves were measured on powders from representative specimens using a CS4 furnace coupled with a MFK1- Kappabridge (AGICO Inc.), in an inert atmosphere. Seven polished thin sections of representative samples were studied using an Olympus BX51 microscope, equipped with a DP72 camera, in both transmitted and reflected light mode.\n\n\n3.3\nAnisotropy of magnetic susceptibility\nThe low-field AMS of specimens of appropriate size\/shape from each sample core was measured in a Kappabridge instrument (MFK1-FA, AGICO), using a three-position automated array. The AMS tensor is represented by an ellipsoid with three principal axes that correspond to the maximum, intermediate, and minimum susceptibilities (K1, K2, and K3 or K\n\nmax\n, K\n\nint\n, and K\n\nmin\n, respectively). The AMS ellipsoid is characterized by a magnetic lineation (L, grouped K\n\nmax\n axes) and a magnetic foliation (F, plane normal to K\n\nmin\n axes). The corrected degree of anisotropy (P\u2032) offers information about magnetic minerals and their degree of preferred orientation, and the shape parameter (T) ranges from \u22121 to 1, for oblate ellipsoids or planar fabrics (T\u00a0>\u00a00) and for prolate ellipsoids or elongated fabrics (T\u00a0<\u00a00). The mean scalar parameters for each site were evaluated according to Jelinek's statistics (Jelinek, 1977, 1978) using the Anisoft 5.1 software (AGICO Inc.).\n\n\n3.4\nPaleomagnetic data\nWe conducted measurements of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and the subsequent progressive demagnetization using a cryogenic magnetometer (2G Enterprises, USA) with a magnetic intensity sensitivity of ~1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 (A\/m) and a JR6-A Dual Speed Spinner Magnetometer (AGICO Inc.). Thermal demagnetization was successfully used on most samples to yield full demagnetization trajectories, with almost no formation of new magnetic phases or spurious behavior during heating, based on progressive thermal demagnetization that typically involved 17 heating steps from 100\u00a0\u00b0C to 700\u00a0\u00b0C with a TD 48 (ASC Scientific) thermal unit until the maximum unblocking temperature of hematite. Thermal demagnetization data were plotted on orthogonal vector diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967), and the magnetization components were isolated by principal component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980). The mean directions were evaluated by Fisher's (1953) statistics, using Remasoft 3.0 (AGICO Inc.) software. All remanence measurements were done in a shielded room in the Paleomagnetism Laboratory at the University of Texas at Dallas (USA).\nThe statistical reversal test classification is based on individual samples for different localities directions using classify on poles and classifies on directions (Koymans et al., 2016; McFadden and McElhinny, 1990). The reversal test is indeterminate following the criteria of Koymans et al. (2016) and the fold test was applied using individual samples for different localities (Koymans et al., 2016; Tauxe and Watson, 1994). We applied the elongation-inclination (E-I) method (Tauxe et al., 2008) to evaluate the possibility of the need for correcting our obtained directional data set for inclination shallowing. According to Tauxe and Kent (2004), the data set used should be large enough to provide sufficient recording of paleosecular variation. The rotation and flattening (relation between the observed and expected inclinations) estimates were calculated for each site according to Demarest (1983), using corrected inclinations and the age-appropriate reference South America paleopoles reported by (Torsvik et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nField observations related to the sample collection\n\n4.1.1\nLocality 1\nIn the axial zone of the northern Eastern Cordillera, the Arcabuco anticlinorium is a symmetric fold that plunges to the south, associated with the east-verging Boyac\u00e1 Fault, and follows the regional trend of the northern axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera (Fig. 1). Upper Triassic to Upper Jurassic rocks form the core of the Arcabuco anticlinorium, while Cretaceous strata form symmetric synclines in the fore and back limbs, Los Medios and Guacamayas synclines, respectively (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 1). The footwall of the Boyac\u00e1 Fault is affected by east-verging reverse faults, interpreted as strands of the Boyac\u00e1 Fault. Locally, west-verging reverse and E-W strike-slip faults deform the Arcabuco anticlinorium. Adjacent to the Arcabuco anticlinorium to the east is located the Floresta Massif and corresponds to the hanging wall of the Soapaga Fault (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 1). Sites were established in the core and both limbs of the Arcabuco anticlinorium, including Palermo (1 site, AP), Montebel (5 sites, AM), and La Rusia (5 sites, AR) formations, allowing for a fold test to be performed and to document variations of paleomagnetic directions in different stratigraphic units (supplementary material 1).\n\n\n4.1.2\nLocality 2\nIn the western flank of the northern Eastern Cordillera, the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium is an asymmetric fold trending ~N10E, bounded to the north by the Bucaramanga Fault and plunging to the south (Fig. 1). Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Gir\u00f3n Group strata form the core of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, while east-verging reverse faults (El Ramo, Zapatoca, and Su\u00e1rez faults) deform the forelimb (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). The Zapatoca Syncline, in the hanging wall of the Su\u00e1rez Fault, involves Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata and plunges to the north and south. The back limb of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium is deformed by west-verging reverse faults, affecting the Lower Cretaceous units. The substantial thickness variation of Gir\u00f3n Group strata, from >4\u00a0km in the hanging wall to <100\u00a0m in the footwall, points out the effect of tectonic inversion of the Su\u00e1rez Fault (supplementary material 2). Seven sites are located in the hanging wall of the Suarez Fault and the forelimb of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium distributed in the >2\u00a0km-thick siliciclastic strata of the Gir\u00f3n Group (supplementary material 2; sites ZG and ZLS).\n\n\n4.1.3\nLocality 3\nIn the footwall of the Bucaramanga Fault, west of southern Santander Massif, the Mesas locality corresponds to the footwall of the Su\u00e1rez reverse fault. This area is characterized by structural flat-blocks of Lower Jurassic Jord\u00e1n Formation and Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Gir\u00f3n Group strata affected by displacement along normal faults and also right-lateral displacement along the NNE-striking El Monje Fault (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). This area is characterized by angular unconformities between metamorphic rocks of mid-Paleozoic age and Lower Jurassic strata and a slight angular unconformity (< 15\u00b0) between the Jord\u00e1n and Gir\u00f3n sequences (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). The thickness variations or absence of the upper Paleozoic to Jurassic rocks along the SN and W-E direction suggest that sedimentation was controlled by Jurassic normal faulting. Nine sites were collected in the volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Jord\u00e1n Formation, located in the footwall of the Suarez and Bucaramanga faults and south of El Monje Fault (supplementary material 2, sites SJ). Two additional sites were collected in the Jord\u00e1n Formation, and they are located farther north (PJ) and south (AJ) of the other nine sites to compare the directions in the same unit at different stratigraphic and structural locations.\n\n\n4.1.4\nLocality 4\nWest of southern Santander Massif, all sites of the Bucaramanga locality were collected in the footwall of the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). In this area, upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks unconformably underlie the Lower Jurassic Jord\u00e1n Formation. Sites are distributed in the Jord\u00e1n Formation (4 sites) and Gir\u00f3n Group (2 sites) located in the footwall of Bucaramanga Fault (supplementary material 2, sites B and G).\n\n\n4.1.5\nLocality 5\nEast of the Bucaramanga Fault, in the southern Santander Massif area is located in the hanging wall of the Bucaramanga Fault, where Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous strata rest unconformably upon basement rocks of the Santander Massif (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). In several blocks within the Santander Massif, a thin and flat Gir\u00f3n Group overlies mid-Paleozoic metamorphic rocks (Fig. 1). In the footwall of the Surat\u00e1 Fault, the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic strata are thick (> 3\u00a0km) (sites MJ3 and JD), while the Gir\u00f3n Group is represented by a thin stratigraphic section (< 100\u00a0m). In the hanging wall of the Surat\u00e1 Fault, the Triassic-Jurassic strata, in general, are absent or locally represented by a thin stratigraphic section (< 100\u00a0m) (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2, sites MJ2 and GR). Despite the structural complexity in this locality, the area has flat-lying strata in structural domains with a thin (<100\u00a0m) and undifferentiated Gir\u00f3n Group (supplementary material 2). The Surat\u00e1 Fault controlled the deposition of Triassic and Jurassic units and is interpreted as an inverted fault (Julivert, 1958). In this locality, sampled sites are distributed in the Jord\u00e1n Formation (3 sites) and Gir\u00f3n Group (4 sites) (supplementary material 2).\n\n\n4.1.6\nLocality 6\nThis locality, named Aguachica, is at the right splay of the Bucaramanga Fault involving basement rocks of the northern Santander Massif. In this area, the >3\u00a0km thick Lower Jurassic Nore\u00e1n Formation overlies the crystalline basement of the Santander Massif. Five sites were collected in the Nore\u00e1n Formation, a unit that is tilted and deformed by the right relay of the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 1) (supplementary material 3, sites N).\n\n\n\n4.2\nMagnetic mineralogy\nIn representative samples analyzed from all six localities, the thermomagnetic experiments (susceptibility versus temperature, all in argon environment) reveal some changes to the magnetic mineralogy over elevated temperature intervals (Fig. 3\n). In some samples, heating and cooling curves are partially reversible, suggesting minor changes during the heating process, and the curves provide Curie temperature estimates of ~580\u00a0\u00b0C and\u00a0~\u00a0680\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3). All samples show a substantial increase in susceptibility in cooling to room temperature. The heating curves show a principal decay between ~580\u00a0\u00b0C and 600\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of magnetite\/maghemite (Fig. 3A, B, D, G, and F). Sample N4 (Fig. 3I Aguachica, locality 6) shows an increase between ~150\u00a0\u00b0C and 350\u00a0\u00b0C on the heating curves, suggesting the neoproduction of maghemite through the transformation of less magnetic Fe-hydroxides during initial heating (Florindo et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2005; Duan et al., 2014). The cooling curves observed in representative samples of all the areas show a susceptibility increase between 700\u00a0\u00b0C and 600\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3D, E, F, G, and H,), and between 590\u00a0\u00b0C and 570\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I), suggesting hematite and magnetite, respectively. Sample AM19 (Fig. 3B Arcabuco, locality 1) is unique in that it shows a cooling peak of ~400\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the production of maghemite.\nSusceptibility is divided into the paramagnetic (kp) and ferrimagnetic (s.l) (kf) components (Hrouda et al., 1997). In the first part of the curves (0\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 200\u00a0\u00b0C) (Fig. 3), the hyperbolic shape observed in samples of all the areas suggests that paramagnetic fraction is the main contributor to the magnetic susceptibility, while a linear trend and a positive slope are indicative for ferromagnetic phases (Hrouda et al., 1997).\nThe IRM acquisition and backfield demagnetization experiments (Fig. 4\n), carried out on representative samples from Arcabuco anticlinorium, Mesas, Santander Massif, and Aguachica localities, mainly show that the acquisition curves have a moderate positive slope over fields below ~300 mT. Saturation is not reached at 2500 mT, suggesting the presence of the high coercivity fraction phases hematite and goethite (Fig. 4). Backfield demagnetization of near-saturation IRM yields approximate coercivity of remanence values ranging from 450 to 700 mT. IRM unmix models reveal different coercivity components from the IRM acquisition curves (Fig. 4). Components 1 and 2 with Bh\u00a0>\u00a02.65 log units (> 447 mT) are consistent with hematite and goethite. Component 3 has a mean coercivity range from 1.50\u20132.30 log units (32\u2013199 mT) and is interpreted as a detrital soft magnetite grain population (Egli, 2004).\nThe thermal demagnetization of three-component IRM results (Lowrie, 1990) carried out on representative samples from all six areas shows that hematite and magnetite are the main magnetic carriers. The hard and medium coercivity fractions are unblocked between ~600\u00a0\u00b0C and 680\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of hematite. The gradual decrease in the medium and soft components between 300\u00a0\u00b0C and 580\u00a0\u00b0C may reflect minor magnetite (Fig. 5\n). Sample N2 (Aguachica, locality 6) shows all three coercivity fractions being fully unblocked at ~580\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting that magnetite is the only appreciable magnetic phase. In samples AM20 (Arcabuco, Locality1), BJ2 (Bucaramanga, locality 4), and GR (southern Santander Massif, locality 5), the hard fraction exhibits a distinct drop in magnetization between room temperature and 200\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of appreciable goethite (Fig. 5).\nThe analysis of eleven polished thin-sections representative of the six areas reveals the presence of abundant authigenic hematite, as fine, translucent grain coatings, and very low modal concentration (<<1% vol) of detrital oxide grains, which appear to include magnetite, maghemite, and\/or specular hematite (Supplementary materials 4). These observations are consistent with the IRM acquisition data from these rocks.\n\n\n4.3\nMagnetic fabric: AMS data\n\n4.3.1\nGeneral results\nA total of 47 sites in fine-grained sandstones, siltstones and mudstones gave interpretable AMS results with a clear magnetic fabric; the AMS parameters for these sites are reported in Table 1\n. The bulk magnetic susceptibility of rocks from the 47 sites (Fig. 6\n, Table 1) is low, with an average Km\u00a0=\u00a0232.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (SI) and a minimum value of 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (SI) (Table 1). The average mean susceptibility (Km) suggests that ferrimagnetic mineral (s.l) phases are minor in concentration and that paramagnetic minerals define the AMS low-field susceptibility (Rochette, 1987; Rochette et al., 1992; Par\u00e9s and van der Pluijm, 2002). Sites N3, N4, N5 from volcaniclastic rocks of Nore\u00e1n Formation (Aguachica, locality 6), sites JD and AJ17 from Jord\u00e1n Formation (southern Santander Massif, locality 5 and Mesas, locality 3, respectively) and site AM19 from Montebel Formation (Arcabuco anticlinorium, locality 1) show bulk susceptibility values of Km above ~300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (Table 1), suggesting that the AMS is controlled by paramagnetic minerals also with a hematite and magnetite\/maghemite contribution (Hrouda, 2010).\nFor sites SJ8, SJ10, SJ15 (Mesas, locality 3) and GR (southern Santander Massif, locality 5), (Fig. 6, Table 1), the K\n\nmax\n axes all cluster close to the normal to bedding, and the Km values are low (220, 300, 78, 180\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (SI), respectively). Rather than an inverse magnetic fabric due to the occurrence of single-domain magnetite (Rochette et al., 1992), the low bulk susceptibilities and the IRM acquisition data preclude a possible occurrence of single-domain particles, suggesting that the inverse fabric is due to the arrangement of AMS carriers by deformation of the rock (Chadima et al., 2009). Previous studies on sedimentary rocks in the Eastern Cordillera reported inverse fabrics in Lower Cretaceous marine clayey-silty rocks exposed in the Arcabuco anticlinorium (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014) suggested that the observed fabrics were due to a second magnetic phase, possibly siderite, contained in a paramagnetic matrix.\nIf we do not consider the four sites that reflect an apparent inverse fabric, the F parameter for the remaining 43 sites is well defined and internally consistent within each site, with average values of 1.014, and the L parameter has an average value of 1.008, indicating a preference for oblate ellipsoids (Table 1 and Fig. 6). The average value of the parameter T is 0.186 (Table 1, Fig. 6), confirming that general AMS ellipsoids are oblate. However, discarding sites GR, SJ8, SJ10, SJ15, for the 12 sites distributed in all six localities of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif, the parameter T is negative (between \u22120.737 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.123), indicating prolate AMS ellipsoids (Table 1and Fig. 6). The P\u2032 parameter is low, ranging from 1.003 to 1.075, indicating a sedimentary fabric that is moderately developed and that it has a possible detrital hematite contribution (Table 1and Fig. 6).\n\n\n4.3.2\nAMS results of Arcabuco anticlinorium, locality 1\nEleven sites are distributed in both limbs of the Arcabuco anticlinorium (Supplementary materials 5). In the Arcabuco anticlinorium, magnetic fabrics reveal a spatial progression of sedimentary fabrics, from intermediate\/near primary (oblate) to triaxial \u2013 prolate ellipsoids.\nThe L and F parameters are internally consistent at each site and show average values of 1.011 and 1.015, respectively. Five sites show prolate ellipsoids with the shape parameter T ranging from \u22120.550 to \u22120.123 (Supplementary materials 5). The average P\u2032 parameter is 1.027, suggesting moderately deformed rocks (Supplementary materials 5). Sites AP27, AM21, AM23, and AR25 have P\u2032 values ranging from 1.033 to 1.054 (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 1). All sites in the Arcabuco anticlinorium exhibit a magnetic lineation that is oriented NNE, and thus sub-parallel to the axial plane of the fold, which has an orientation of NE, with site mean k\n\nmin\n and k\n\nint\n axes distributed within a girdle (Figs. 7\n and Supplementary materials 5). This distribution is interpreted as the mix of a weakly developed layer-parallel shortening (LPS) and an original sedimentary depositional fabric (Weil and Yonkee, 2009). However, Roperch et al. (2010) interpreted plunging AMS lineations to possibly indicate the result of a complex folding sequence, which is often very difficult to discriminate based on field relations.\n\n\n4.3.3\nAMS results of Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, locality 2\nSeven sites are distributed in the forelimb of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium and have magnetic L and F average values of 1.013 and 1.027, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5). The average of the shape parameter T for these sites is 0.350, suggesting the predominance of oblate ellipsoids (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). In the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, five sites show P\u2032 values over 1.030, two of the sites have P\u2032 values ranging from 1.054 to 1.075, suggesting hematite contribution to the AMS (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5). Even though the contribution of a ferromagnetic (s.l) component, in six of these seven sites reveal sedimentary fabrics, as defined by K\n\nmin\n axes clustered around the bedding pole (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5); only site (ZG5) shows a triaxial ellipsoid with K\nmin directions forming a girdle oblique to the bedding plane (Supplementary materials 5).\n\n\n4.3.4\nAMS results of Mesas, locality 3 and Bucaramanga, locality 4\nSeventeen sites are distributed in the Mesas and Bucaramanga localities (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). As noted above, three sites (SJ8, SJ10, and SJ15), all in red mudstones of the Jord\u00e1n Formation, have a K\n\nmax\n cluster around the bedding pole (, Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5), suggesting inverse magnetic fabrics (e.g., Rochette et al., 1992). The remaining fourteen sites have an average L parameter of 1.005, F parameter of 1.010, and T value of 0.251, suggesting the prevalence of oblate ellipsoids (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5). The average P\u2032 value is low (1.016), suggesting very weakly deformed rocks (Figs. 8 and 9\n\n). Three of the sites (SJ9, BJ1, and BJ4) show prolate ellipsoids (Fig. 7 Supplementary materials 5). Three sites (SJ11, SJ14, and SJ16) show scattered principal susceptibility directions (Table 1).\n\n\n4.3.5\nAMS results of Santander Massif, locality 5- and Aguachica, locality 6\nThe paleomagnetic and magnetic fabric (AMS) results from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif provide information bearing on the patterns of deformation that contribute to improving local and regional kinematic models of deformation in the northern Andes. In the Arcabuco anticlinorium, the AMS data show weak to moderate deformational magnetic fabrics, and magnetic lineations are sub-parallel to the regional trend of structures. \u00a0In the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, magnetic lineations are less well-defined, as these rocks preserve a well-defined sedimentary fabric with oblate ellipsoids. Magnetic fabrics in rocks from the Mesas, Bucaramanga and southern Santander Massif suggest that these rocks retain primary, depositional fabrics. On the other hand, rocks exhibiting prolate\/triaxial ellipsoids are located around the main trace of regional faults (e. g., the Bucaramanga, Su\u00e1rez, and Surat\u00e1\u00a0faults).The seven sites we established in the Santander Massif are distributed in rocks of the hanging wall of the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). These sites have low mean L and F values of 1.006 and 1.009, respectively (Supplementary materials 5). The average of the shape parameter T is 0.120, and the average of P\u2032 is 1.016 (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5), which suggests the presence of very weak deformation fabrics in the rocks in this part of the Santander Massif. Sites S1, S2, and S3 show well-defined k\n\nmin\n axes that cluster around normals to bedding, indicating the preservation of sedimentary fabrics (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). Sites JD and MJ3 show triaxial ellipsoid fabrics (Supplementary materials 5), and site GR yields a K\n\nmax\n cluster that is parallel to the normal to bedding (Table 1), again suggesting an inverse magnetic fabric (e.g., Rochette et al., 1992). In the Aguachica locality, sites N1, N2, N3, N5 all show magnetic fabrics defined by oblate ellipsoids, and site (N4) with T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204 is defined as prolate (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). In the southern Santander Massif (locality 5), however, the AMS ellipsoids from Jord\u00e1n Formation are prolate (sites MJ3 and JD) with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.737 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.300, respectively. In site MJ2, the AMS ellipsoid is triaxial with a shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a00.130. Magnetic lineations in sites MJ2 and MJ3 trend SE and are normal to the trace of the Surat\u00e1\u00a0Fault, suggesting a magnetic fabric that originated during extension; this type of fabric is common in inverted basins (Soto et al., 2007, 2008). The steep magnetic lineations (JD) are parallel to the trace of the Surat\u00e1\u00a0Fault, and these are interpreted to have probably originated during the fault inversion. Only in SJ9, BJ1, and BJ4 sites in Mesas and Bucaramanga localities, the AMS ellipsoids are prolate with\u00a0T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.185,\u00a0\u22120.557, and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.561, respectively (Fig. 7\u00a0and Supplementary materials\u00a05). In Aguachica (locality 6), the AMS ellipsoids are interpreted as sedimentary fabrics (sites N1, N3, and N5), and\u00a0K\n\nmin\n\u00a0axes are clustered around the bedding pole. In site N4, the AMS ellipsoid is interpreted as prolate with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204, and in site N2, the AMS ellipsoid is interpreted as triaxial with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a00.189 (Fig. 7\u00a0and Supplementary materials\u00a05). In both sites, deformation is linked to contractional splays of Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 9 and Supplementary materials\u00a05), as suggested by\u00a0Velandia (2017).\nThe seven sites we established in the Santander Massif are distributed in rocks of the hanging wall of the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). These sites have low mean L and F values of 1.006 and 1.009, respectively (Supplementary materials 5). The average of the shape parameter T is 0.120, and the average of P\u2032 is 1.016 (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5), which suggests the presence of very weak deformation fabrics in the rocks in this part of the Santander Massif. Sites S1, S2, and S3 show well-defined k\n\nmin\n axes that cluster around normals to bedding, indicating the preservation of sedimentary fabrics (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). Sites JD and MJ3 show triaxial ellipsoid fabrics (Supplementary materials 5), and site GR yields a K\n\nmax\n cluster that is parallel to the normal to bedding (Table 1), again suggesting an inverse magnetic fabric (e.g., Rochette et al., 1992). In the Aguachica locality, sites N1, N2, N3, N5 all show magnetic fabrics defined by oblate ellipsoids, and site (N4) with T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204 is defined as prolate (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5).\n\n\n\n4.4\nPaleomagnetism\n\n4.4.1\nDemagnetization behavior\nIn the context of our interpretation of the paleomagnetic data reported here, we apply the following criteria and\/or assumptions: 1) The ChRM recorded by accepted sites is primary and is carried by early-formed authigenic hematite as well as a combination of detrital hematite and magnetite. 2) magnetization components resolved in progressive demagnetization as free-floating line segments are associated with maximum angular deviation (MAD) values well less than 20\u00b0, and that \u03b1\n95 confidence limits for estimated site mean directions are also well less than 20o. 3) Estimated site mean directions, on an individual basis, given our strategy of sampling multiple beds at a site provide a reasonable estimate of the time-averaged geomagnetic field (GAD field direction) at the time of magnetization acquisition during an interval of either normal or reverse polarity.\nThe Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous strata that we sampled from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif are moderately magnetic with average NRM intensities around 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0A\/m (Fig. 8). Notably, mudstone samples from the Montebel Formation in the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1) have uniformly lower intensities, with the NRM ~1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0A\/m. The response to progressive demagnetization by these sedimentary rocks is straightforward, with normal and reverse polarity magnetizations sufficiently well-isolated. A viscous magnetization was removed over the first few steps of thermal treatment up to ~200\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 8). Demagnetization diagrams from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif show multivectorial paths (Fig. 8). Sites displaying univectorial paths (e.g., B1, S1) (Fig. 8) define magnetizations that are oriented to the north and exhibit high laboratory unblocking temperatures in the range from ~500 to 680\u00a0\u00b0C. A ChRM is typically resolved between ~500 and 680\u00a0\u00b0C, although for some specimens, the ChRM was isolated between 400 and 680\u00a0\u00b0C. The overall demagnetization response indicates that hematite is the main magnetization carrier with a possible coexistence with magnetite (Fig. 8).\nAs a result, a total of 39 sites (out of 47 sites sampled) passed the above quality criteria. However, for the sites AP27, AM21, B4, S3, and N5, the site-mean directions were defined with specimens from only three independent samples. Paleomagnetic directions yielded unanchored line fits with maximum angular deviation values between 2.8\u00b0 and 19.9\u00b0 (Fig. 8). The remaining eight sites yielded scattered magnetization directions and were discarded from further considerations (Table 2\n). After tilt correction (restoration of sedimentary bedding to the paleohorizontal), a total of 27 sites have normal polarity, and the other 12 sites have reverse polarity (Figs. 8, 9, and Table 2). Site-mean directions are usually distinct from the geocentric axial dipole (GAD) field direction (D\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 and I\u00a0=\u00a014\u00b0) (Fig. 9). Directions for sites AM19, AR24, B1, B2, ZLS and ZLS2, in in situ coordinates, are close to the GAD field direction; however, specimens (sites AM19 and ZLS2) and over\/underlayer sites have reverse and normal polarities, excluding a possible recent magnetic overprint of those sites.\n\n\n4.4.2\nReversal and fold tests for ChRM by study area\nThe reversal test for accepted sites from the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1) and the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2) is classified as class C. The reversal test for Mesas (locality 3) is classified as negative, and for Bucaramanga (locality 4) and southern Santander Massif (locality 5) is indeterminate. The fold test in the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1), Bucaramanga (locality 4), and Aguachica (locality 6) reveals a maximum eigenvalue (T) between 3 and 49, 23 to 70, and 35 to 90, respectively, suggesting, at face value, syn-tilting magnetizations. The fold test in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2), Mesas (locality 3), and southern Santander Massif (locality 5) reveals a maximum eigenvalue (T) between 72 and 159, 94 to 150, and 71 to 151, respectively, suggesting pre-folding magnetizations.\nDespite the overall outcomes of both reversal and fold tests, which may reflect the relatively small number of data used for specific localities and the possibility of differential rotation within specific localities, the preservation of a primary remnant magnetization (Fig. 9) may be supported by the following results: (1) the recording of both normal and reverse polarity in our 39 sites from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif, despite the different results of the reversal test, and (2) results of fold tests suggesting either a syn-tilting or pre-folding magnetizations. Therefore, field tests and magnetic mineralogy data allow us considering that the ChRM recorded by accepted sites is primary and is carried by early-formed authigenic hematite as well as a combination of detrital hematite and magnetite.\n\n\n4.4.3\nInclination correction\nWe combined all the individual sample data from all accepted sites in all localities of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif and applied the elongation-inclination (E-I) method of Tauxe et al. (2008) on data from 270 independent samples (Supplementary materials 6).). If all of these samples are included as a single set, the unflattening (correction) procedure tracks the changes from ~15.0\u00b0 before unflattening (observed result) to ~36.9\u00b0 after unflattening and is associated with an f value ~0.39 (Supplementary materials 6). For the 157 samples from just sites in the Lower Jurassic strata (Supplementary materials 6), the unflattening procedure tracks the changes from ~16.7\u00b0 before unflattening (observed) to ~33.5\u00b0 after unflattening and is associated with an f value ~0.45 (Supplementary materials 6). Finally, for the 113 samples from Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata (Supplementary materials 6), the unflattening procedure tracks the changes from ~11.2\u00b0 before unflattening (observed) to ~28.1\u00b0 after unflattening and is associated with an f value ~0.37 (Supplementary materials 6). The estimated f value for the second data set, from the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata, is unusually low for these kinds of sedimentary rocks, and we suspect that this is an artifact of a relatively small sample data set. To avoid possible bias, the inclination shallowing effects were also corrected with Pmagpy (Tauxe et al., 2016) using a flattening factor (f) value of (0.6) based on data reported for similar types of sedimentary rocks (Bilardello and Kodama, 2010; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2021) and the results are summarized by sites in Table 2 and formations in Table 3.\nWe combined all the individual sample data from all accepted sites in all localities of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif and applied the elongation-inclination (E-I) method of Tauxe et al. (2008) on data from 270 independent samples (Supplementary materials 6). If all of these samples are included as a single set, the unflattening (correction) procedure tracks the changes from ~15.0\u00b0 before unflattening (observed result) to ~36.9\u00b0 after unflattening and is associated with an f value ~0.39 (Supplementary materials 6).

The estimated f value for the second data set, from the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata, is unusually low for these kinds of sedimentary rocks, and we suspect that this is an artifact of a relatively small sample data set. To avoid possible bias, the inclination shallowing effects were also corrected with Pmagpy (Tauxe et al., 2016) using a flattening factor (f) value of (0.6) based on data reported for similar types of sedimentary rocks (Bilardello and Kodama, 2010; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2021) and the results are summarized by sites in Table 2 and formations in Table 3.\n\n\n4.4.4\nEstimation of vertical axis rotations\n\nThe rotation and flattening values were calculated using the tilt-corrected characteristic components along with inclination values that have been corrected using an f value of 0.6 (Table 2), for our Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous data, according to Demarest (1983). We used the expected directions derived from the 150\u00a0Ma (latitude 87.0\u00b0N, longitude 187.30\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a06.4\u00b0), 160\u00a0Ma (latitude 88.0\u00b0N, longitude 124.9\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a05.1\u00b0), 180\u00a0Ma (latitude 83.4\u00b0N, longitude 38.8\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a03.4\u00b0), 190\u00a0Ma (latitude 78.5\u00b0N, longitude 41.4\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a02.9\u00b0) and the 200\u00a0Ma (latitude 74.4\u00b0N, longitude 58.7\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a02.8\u00b0) Torsvik et al. (2012) poles (Table 2) and rotated into the coordinate frame of the South America Plate (Koymans et al., 2016).\nIn the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1), after tilt correction, seven sites are of normal polarity. Sites AM19, AM23, AR18, and AR24 show north-directed declinations and shallow to moderate positive inclination. Sites AP27, AR22 show northeast seeking declination and shallow positive inclination. Site AR28 shows a northwest seeking and moderate positive inclination (Fig. 11 and Table 2). The other two sites are of reverse polarity (AM21 and AR25) with southward declination and shallow negative and positive inclinations (Fig. 11A and Table 2).\nFor the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2), after tilt correction, five sites of the Gir\u00f3n Group are of normal polarity and show northeast seeking declination and moderate to shallow positive inclination. Two sites are of reverse polarity with southward declination and moderate to shallow negative and positive inclination (Fig. 11B and Table 2).\nIn the Mesas and Bucaramanga area (localities 3 and 4), after tilt correction, eight sites of the Jord\u00e1n Formation and Gir\u00f3n Group are of normal polarity, showing a northward to northeast declination and moderate to shallow inclinations of both positive and negative values. The other six sites in the Jord\u00e1n Formation are of reverse polarity with southwest to westward declinations and moderate to shallow negative and positive inclinations (Fig. 11C and Table 2). Finally, in the Santander Massif and Aguachica (localities 5 and 6), after tilt correction, seven sites are of normal polarity with scattered declinations. Site JD of the Jord\u00e1n Formation yields a northeastward declination and shallow positive inclination. Sites N3, N4, and N5 of the Nore\u00e1n Formation show a northward declination and shallow negative and positive inclinations. Sites S1, S2, and S3 of the Gir\u00f3n Group show a northwest declination and shallow positive inclinations. Two sites of Jord\u00e1n (MJ2) and Nere\u00e1n (N2) formations are of reverse polarity with southward declination and shallow positive inclinations) (Fig. 11D and Table 2).\nBased on our sampling strategy and the criteria\/assumptions described above, if individual site-mean directions provide a sufficient average of the field, then the overall dispersion in site-mean declination data, which is considerably greater than the dispersion in inclination data, is plausibly interpreted to be in large part due to vertical axis rotations (Fig. 9). The new paleomagnetic results in tilt-corrected coordinates reported here from the northern Eastern Cordillera in the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1), based on appropriate age reference directions derived from reference paleomagnetic pole positions (Torsvik et al., 2012), show that observed directional discordances imply five sites with low, insignificant magnitudes of CW sense rotation to more moderate values, from 1.4\u00b0 +\/\u2212 3.9\u00b0 to 36.4\u00b0 +\/\u2212 9.6\u00b0 and four sites with CCW senses, some of which are significant, ranging from \u221251.5\u00b0 +\/\u2212 24.7\u00b0 to - 5.9\u00b0 +\/\u2212 10.8\u00b0 (Figs. 9 and 10\n, Table 2).\nDeclination data from sites in the forelimb of Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2) and Mesas- Bucaramanga (localities 3 and 4) in comparison to reference directions (Torsvik et al., 2012) imply CW rotations up to 90.7\u00b0 +\/\u2212 9.8\u00b0 (maximum rotation values documented in this work), with a general trend in the magnitude of rotation decreasing to the north (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2).\nIn the southern Santander Massif (locality 5), discordances with respect to expected directions derived from paleopoles of Torsvik et al. (2012) imply CCW rotations up to \u221233.1\u00b0 +\/\u2212 11.3\u00b0 (sites S1, S2, and S3) and CW rotations up to 42.2\u00b0 +\/\u2212 12.4\u00b0 (site JD) (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2). In Aguachica (locality 6), data from two sites (N2 and N4) suggest low, insignificant magnitude of CW rotation up to 9.2\u00b110.6 and two sites (N3 and N5) suggest a minor CCW rotation up to \u221212.6\u00b15.4 (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.5\nPaleolatitude estimates\nThe flattening (F) parameter is defined as the difference between the expected and observed inclinations, assuming that the observed data set represents an adequate time-averaging of the paleomagnetic field. A positive flattening occurs when the observed inclination is lower than the expected inclination, which is suggestive of northward translations in the northern hemisphere. Based on paleopoles reported by Torsvik et al. (2012), only 13 sites are characterized by positive flattening values (Table 2). A total of 26 sites are characterized by negative flattening values (Table 3), 13 sites show flattening values with magnitudes greater than 15\u00b0, and those sites cannot be used for latitudinal estimations, probably due to a bias during the inclination correction that was applied, as suggested by Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021). Discarding the data from these 13 sites (Table 2), estimated paleolatitudes, calculated for specific formations (Table 3, Supplementary materials 6), were compared with reference pole information from Torsvik et al. (2012) and other paleolatitude estimates based on results from previous studies (Bayona et al., 2006, 2010; Nova et al., 2012; Jim\u00e9nez et al.,2021) (Supplementary materials 6). The paleolatitude estimates, based on data corrected for a plausible magnitude of inclination shallowing (unflattened) in this study lie within the confidence interval of the data set provided by Torsvik et al. (2012) (Supplementary materials 6). Unflattened paleolatitudes for the Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous formations from the northern part of the Eastern Cordillera and the Santander Massif lie over the confidence interval of Torsvik et al. (2012), suggesting displacements from original shallow paleolatitude positions (Supplementary materials 6).\nThe flattening (F) parameter is defined as the difference between the expected and observed inclinations, assuming that the observed data set represents an adequate time-averaging of the paleomagnetic field. A positive flattening occurs when the observed inclination is lower than the expected inclination, which is suggestive of northward translations in the northern hemisphere. Based on paleopoles reported by Torsvik et al. (2012), only 13 sites are characterized by positive flattening values (Table 2).

Magnetic susceptibility lineations reported from Jurassic rocks in the Arcabuco anticlinorium are oriented subparallel to the regional trend of the northern Eastern Cordillera and they have shallow plunge values, on average 14.6o (Fig. 7, Table 1). These results are consistent with magnetic lineations reported from marine Cretaceous rocks in the forelimb of the Arcabuco anticlinorium and also Cenozoic continental-affinity strata in the footwall of Boyac\u00e1 Fault (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). According to Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014), the development of extension-related normal faults during the early Mesozoic and the subsequent shortening phase under noncoaxial strain may have caused the lineations to deviate from the horizontal in a complex, multi-stage fold sequence as suggested by Roperch et al. (2010).\nIn the Mesas, Bucaramanga, and Santander Massif localities, K\n\nmin\n axes are clustered around the normal to sedimentary bedding, and K\n\nmax\n and K\n\nint\n axes define a foliation that is parallel to subparallel to bedding attitudes, confirming the preservation of predominantly sedimentary magnetic fabrics (Fig. 7).\n\n5\n5\n5\n\nIn the southern Santander Massif (locality 5), however, the AMS ellipsoids from Jord\u00e1n Formation are prolate (sites MJ3 and JD) with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.737 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.300, respectively. In site MJ2, the AMS ellipsoid is triaxial with a shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a00.130. Magnetic lineations in sites MJ2 and MJ3 trend SE and are normal to the trace of the Surat\u00e1 Fault, suggesting a magnetic fabric that originated during extension; this type of fabric is common in inverted basins (Soto et al., 2007, 2008). The steep magnetic lineations (JD) are parallel to the trace of the Surat\u00e1 Fault, and these are interpreted to have probably originated during the fault inversion. Only in SJ9, BJ1, and BJ4 sites in Mesas and Bucaramanga localities, the AMS ellipsoids are prolate with T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.185, \u22120.557, and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.561, respectively (Fig.7 and Supplementary materials 5). In Aguachica (locality 6), the AMS ellipsoids are interpreted as sedimentary fabrics (sites N1, N3, and N5), and K\n\nmin\n axes are clustered around the bedding pole. In site N4, the AMS ellipsoid is interpreted as prolate with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204, and in site N2, the AMS ellipsoid is interpreted as triaxial with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a00.189 (Fig.7 and Supplementary materials 5). In both sites, deformation is linked to contractional splays of Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 9 and Supplementary materials 5), as suggested by Velandia (2017).\n\n\n5.2\nInferred vertical axis rotations\nBased on data from the northern Eastern Cordillera and the Arcabuco anticlinorium, the magnitude of rotations experienced by the back limb and the core of the Arcabuco anticlinorium is less than about 12\u00b0, in agreement with data reported for marine Cretaceous rocks in the footwall of the Boyac\u00e1 Fault (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014) and these results are interpreted to confirm that the axial zone of the northern Eastern Cordillera has not experienced appreciable crustal rotation (Fig. 10). There are exceptions to this general interpretation, in that data from four sites located in the core and forelimb of the Arcabuco anticlinorium show significant declination discordances and these may be linked to local strike-slip structures (Fig. 10 and supplementary material 1). Vertical axis rotations are related to displacement along strike-slip faults (Piper et al., 1997; Sussman et al., 2004; Randall et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2004, 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 2014; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2015). The magnitude of vertical axes rotations may under certain circumstances follow the power-law rheology model (England et al., 1985) in which case there is a relation between the distance from a fault trace and the magnitude of rotation. Local strike-slip faults in the Arcabuco anticlinorium show relatively low displacement, and the sites are spaced from the fault trace, therefore there are variations or lacks of the observed rotations between sites. The inferred, significant CW rotations in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, Mesas, Bucaramanga, and southern Santander Massif are linked to NE-SW oriented right-lateral strike-slip faults (e.g., Surat\u00e1 and El Monje faults) (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2). The inferred CCW rotations in the Santander Massif are linked to regional strike-slip displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2). As above, thickness variations in sequences of Jurassic age strata are interpreted as a consequence of the development of a Triassic-Jurassic transtensional basin (Bayona et al., 2006; Sarmiento-Rojas et al., 2006). According to Sarmiento-Rojas et al. (2006), the Triassic-Jurassic transtensional basins were narrow and progressively increased in width during deformation. The strike-slip component gradually decreased, and the magnitude of dip-slip displacement increased. Bayona et al. (2006) reported CCW rotations of ~90\u00b0 from rocks of the Jord\u00e1n Formation in the Mesas locality and related this deformation to localized deformation of transverse normal structures. Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) reported data from Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks that supported a CW rotation of ~48\u00b0 in the forelimb of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium as a consequence of displacement along the Bucaramanga, Su\u00e1rez, and NE-SW transverse faults (e.g., El Monje Fault), parallel to the Surat\u00e1 Fault.\nPaleogeographic reconstructions of northwest South America and adjacent areas in Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous time, in part derived from paleomagnetic data, suggest that the Maya Block (Mexico) was juxtaposed against northern South America (Bartok et al., 2015; Pindell and Kennan, 2001) with a CCW rotation of up to about 50\u00b0 after ca. 154\u00a0Ma (Pindell et al., 2006). According to Kneller and Johnson (2011), the onset of the counterclockwise rotation of the Yucat\u00e1n block took place after ca. 176\u00a0Ma, in response to the propagation of seafloor spreading into the Proto\u2013Caribbean Sea. During Tithonian to Berriasian time, the rotation of the Maya Block ceased (Pindell and Dewey, 1982; Pindell and Kennan, 2009; Molina-Garza et al., 1992; God\u00ednez-Urban et al., 2011). Pindell et al. (2021) suggested a moderate magnitude of westward extension of the northern Andes to accommodate the movement of Yucatan block.\n\nJim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) reported CW rotations of ~45\u00b0 for a complete section of Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata of the Gir\u00f3n Group in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (Fig. 10), and the estimated rotations are inferred to be related to regional Neogene strike-slip displacements of the Bucaramanga Fault and the inversion of early-formed normal faults into NE-SW trending reverse structures with right-lateral displacement components. Velandia et al. (2020) propose a domino-style model for the deformation of the southern Santander Massif, involving displacement on the longitudinal left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault and NE-SW transverse inner faults with a right-lateral component in the Mesas and Bucaramanga localities. According to Velandia et al. (2020) the transpressional regime of the southern Santander Massif differs from the compressive regime that characterizes nearby crustal elements (Perij\u00e1 Range, or the northern Eastern Cordillera in the Floresta Massif). The domino-style model (Velandia et al., 2020) suggests CCW rotations in the southern Santander Massif and implies the presence of CCW rotated structural blocks in the footwall of the Bucaramanga Fault and the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium locality. The domino-style model also implies the presence of a second regional NNW left-lateral fault, parallel to the Bucaramanga Fault. Velandia (2017) described geomorphologic evidence for the proposed trace of the left-lateral Lebrija Fault within the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium. Another possible model is the conjugate set of bounding faults forming a strike-slip domain (Velandia, 2017; Velandia et al., 2020). This model explains the CW rotations inferred for Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, Bucaramanga area, and the Mesas area, and integrates displacement along the NNW left-lateral Lebrija Fault. However, regional maps and cross-sections (e.g., Ward et al., 1973; Tes\u00f3n et al., 2013; Caballero et al., 2013) show the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium to be a structural domain affected by reverse faulting along with inversion structures without evidence of regional NNW strike-slip faults. In the Maracaibo block and Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, CW rotations (~45\u00b0) are associated with Neogene displacement along the Bocon\u00f3 Fault (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014) and regional and local strike-slip faults (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2021), respectively. According to Nova et al. (2012) CW rotations in the Perij\u00e1 Range are up to about 45\u00b0 (Fig. 11\n). Montes et al. (2003) proposed the opening of the Lower Magdalena Valley to have provided the mechanism for regional CW rotation.\nIn our hypothesized model, the rotation pattern in the northern Andes is related to the reactivation of NE-trending normal \/transverse structures (e.g., the El Monje and Surat\u00e1 faults) as right-lateral faults (Velandia, 2017; Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2012). Sarmiento (2011) reported several subsurface deformation zones of Eocene age (Figs. 1 and 10), forming an arch with an approximate N-S orientation, that may be product of reactivation of Mesozoic structures. According to Costantino et al. (2021), the tectonic inversion in the Eastern Cordillera started during the Oligocene, and is characterized by thick-skinned style of crustal deformation involving uplift of the crystalline basement along high angle reverse faults. These transverse faults form structural and stratigraphic limits between deforming blocks, defining a systematic pattern of moderate magnitude clockwise rotation (Fig. 11C). Locally, in Bucaramanga and Aguachica (localities 4 and 6, respectively), the magnitude of rotation decreases because the magnitude of total displacement along the transverse faults is minor to essentially zero and this may be a reflection of the structural block aspect ratio, with the long axis oriented parallel to the Bucaramanga Fault.\n\n\n5.3\nPaleolatitude estimates of northern Andes tectonic elements\nAccording to Castillo et al. (1991), the M\u00e9rida Andes did not experience significant latitudinal displacement with respect to the South American craton. Bayona et al. (2006, 2010) proposed that crustal elements exposing Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic age rocks had been translated northward with respect to stable South America. According to Molina-Garza et al. (2020), Lower and Middle Jurassic strata exposed in Central Oaxaca and other regions of central and eastern Mexico were deposited at near-equatorial paleolatitudes and thus have been translated northward a considerable distance. Paleogeographic reconstruction of northern South America during the Jurassic implies an overlap of the central Andes of Colombia with southern Mexico. In addition, according to Nova et al. (2012), the Perij\u00e1 Range experienced no significant latitudinal displacement and these workers invoked the presence of a paleostructure to explain the latitudinal discrepancy between a stable Perij\u00e1 Range and a displaced Santa Marta Massif. Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) discussed the limitations of paleolatitude estimates based on uncorrected inclinations reported in several earlier paleomagnetic investigations of sedimentary sequences in the northern Andes. Therefore, paleolatitudes originally estimated for the Perij\u00e1 Range area and other northern blocks (e.g., Guajira block) could be ambiguous and require further detailed analysis, as Nova et al. (2019) suggested. Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) reported corrected inclination data for the Gir\u00f3n Group in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium and discussed some potential limitations, based on specific data sets, of using the elongation-inclination (E\u2013I) method of Tauxe et al. (2008). According to Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021), the paleolatitude for the Gir\u00f3n Group strata in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, after correction for inclination shallowing using an f value of 0.6, is estimated to be about 7.0\u00b0 N\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4o, which corresponds to the modern\u2013day latitude, and this estimate is slightly lower than the 11.3\u00b0N\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.4o paleolatitude estimate based on uncorrected inclination data earlier reported by Bayona et al., (2006) (Supplementary materials 6).\nAccording to Castillo et al.

(2006) (Supplementary materials 6) probably because for very shallow inclinations the correction is of low magnitude. During the Early to Middle Jurassic, the tectonic elements (e.g., Santa Marta, Santander and Floresta massifs) associated with the subduction process of the Farallon Plate were located at very shallow latitudes (Supplementary materials 6). During the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, at the time of deposition of the Gir\u00f3n Group, these tectonic elements were located in the northern hemisphere, at latitudes of ~4\u00b0 to ~7\u00b0N. The magnitude of the latitudinal translation then decreased, and only minor northward translation may have occurred since the Late Jurassic, as suggested by Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) (Supplementary materials 6). According to Gerritsen et al. (2022) the paleopoles, quantify the past position of rocks relative to the geomagnetic pole and constrain tectonic reconstructions and apparent polar wander paths (APWPs). Gerritsen et al. (2022) suggest the paleopoles calculation improves using multiple samples per site. Therefore the Nore\u00e1n, Jord\u00e1n and La Rusia formations, and the Gir\u00f3n Group are the best units to improve the precision of paleopole in future studies.\nThe paleolatitude estimate for Gir\u00f3n Group rocks exposed in the southern Santander Massif iscoherent with the uncorrected paleolatitudes reported by Bayona et al.

During the Neogene, at least 45\u00a0km of displacement along the left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault reactivated transverse secondary faults (e.g., El Monje and Surat\u00e1 Faults) (Fig. 11C). Major rotations (> 90\u00b0) affected the Mesas and Bucaramanga localities, where the block aspect ratio (Randall et al., 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 2014) (short\/long axis) is 1:1, and blocks are limited in dimension (width) by NE strike-slip faults. Crustal blocks experienced minimal rotation (< 10\u00b0) in Aguachica (locality 6) because of a more elongated block aspect ratio (Randall et al., 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 2014), with the long axis oriented parallel to Bucaramanga Fault. In the southern Santander Massif (locality 5), both CW rotations in relation to displacement along NE strike-slip faults (e.g., Surat\u00e1 Fault) and CCW rotations are related to Neogene displacements along the Bucaramanga Fault.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe vertical axis rotations confirm the nonrotational nature of the chain. Local strike-slip faults are responsible for the inferred CW and CCW sense rotations in the core and forelimb of the Arcabuco anticlinorium. In the northern Eastern Cordillera, estimated rotations are lower in magnitude and often not statistically significant, and deformation is dissipated with the layer parallel shortening erasing the primary depositional magnetic fabric. The inferred CW rotations in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, as indicated by systematic declination data, are linked to right-lateral strike-slip displacements along several structures (e.g., the El Monje Fault). The inferred CCW rotations in the southern Santander Massif are explained as a consequence of displacement along the regional, left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault. In the Mesas, Bucaramanga, and southern Santander Massif localities, the systematic CW rotations are related to right-lateral strike-slip displacements along transverse faults reactivated as a consequence of Neogene displacement on the Bucaramanga Fault. In the northern area, at the Aguachica locality, the magnitudes of inferred vertical axis rotations are relatively low, probably controlled by the block aspect ratio, with the long axis oriented parallel to Bucaramanga Fault. The block rotatio In our hypothesized model, the rotation pattern in the northern Andes is related to the reactivation of NE-trending normal \/transverse structures (e.g., the El Monje and Surat\u00e1 faults) as right-lateral faults (Velandia, 2017; Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2012). Sarmiento (2011) reported several subsurface deformation zones of Eocene age (Figs. 1 and 10), forming an arch with an approximate N-S orientation, that may be product of reactivation of Mesozoic structures. ns of a clockwise sense that we report are consistent with the GPS data showing that the northern Andes is moving northeastward at a rate of about 8.6\u00a0mm\/yr (Mora-P\u00e1ez et al., 2020) (Figs. 1A and 11C). In the Santander Massif and the western flank of the Eastern Cordillera, during the time interval of tectonic inversion, regional left lateral displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault (> 45\u00a0km) reactivated ancient normal faults as right-lateral faults (e.g., El Monje and Surat\u00e1 faults). In these rigid blocks, deformation is dissipated with systematic vertical axis rotations ranging up to about 90\u00b0, and the magnetic fabric data show that these rocks preserve primary fabrics. During the Early Jurassic (time of deposition of the Jord\u00e1n and Nore\u00e1n formations), the tectonic blocks were located at shallow latitudes (Fig. 11A Supplementary materials 6). During the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, at the time of deposition of the La Rusia Formation and the Gir\u00f3n Group, those tectonics blocks had been translated into the northern hemisphere, at latitudes of ~4\u00b0 to ~7\u00b0N. Since the Early Cretaceous, the magnitude of the latitudinal translation decreased, and only minor northward translation occurred (Fig. 11B and Supplementary materials 6).\nThe paleomagnetic and magnetic fabric (AMS) results from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif provide information bearing on the patterns of deformation that contribute to improving local and regional kinematic models of deformation in the northern Andes. In the Arcabuco anticlinorium, the AMS data show weak to moderate deformational magnetic fabrics, and magnetic lineations are sub-parallel to the regional trend of structures. The vertical axis rotations confirm the nonrotational nature of the chain. Local strike-slip faults are responsible for the inferred CW and CCW sense rotations in the core and forelimb of the Arcabuco anticlinorium. In the northern Eastern Cordillera, estimated rotations are lower in magnitude and often not statistically significant, and deformation is dissipated with the layer parallel shortening erasing the primary depositional magnetic fabric. In the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, magnetic lineations are less well-defined, as these rocks preserve a well-defined sedimentary fabric with oblate ellipsoids. The inferred CW rotations in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, as indicated by systematic declination data, are linked to right-lateral strike-slip displacements along several structures (e.g., the El Monje Fault). Magnetic fabrics in rocks from the Mesas, Bucaramanga and southern Santander Massif suggest that these rocks retain primary, depositional fabrics. On the other hand, rocks exhibiting prolate\/triaxial ellipsoids are located around the main trace of regional faults (e. g., the Bucaramanga, Su\u00e1rez, and Surat\u00e1 faults). The inferred CCW rotations in the southern Santander Massif are explained as a consequence of displacement along the regional, left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault. In the Mesas, Bucaramanga, and southern Santander Massif localities, the systematic CW rotations are related to right-lateral strike-slip displacements along transverse faults reactivated as a consequence of Neogene displacement on the Bucaramanga Fault. In the northern area, at the Aguachica locality, the magnitudes of inferred vertical axis rotations are relatively low, probably controlled by the block aspect ratio, with the long axis oriented parallel to Bucaramanga Fault. In our hypothesized model, the rotation pattern in the northern Andes is related to the reactivation of NE-trending normal \/transverse structures (e.g., the El Monje and Surat\u00e1 faults) as right-lateral faults (Velandia, 2017; Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2012). Sarmiento (2011) reported several subsurface deformation zones of Eocene age (Figs. 1 and 10), forming an arch with an approximate N-S orientation, that may be product of reactivation of Mesozoic structures. Rotations of a clockwise sense that we report are consistent with the GPS data showing that the northern Andes is moving northeastward at a rate of about 8.6\u00a0mm\/yr (Mora-P\u00e1ez et al., 2020) (Figs. 1A and 11C). In the Santander Massif and the western flank of the Eastern Cordillera, during the time interval of tectonic inversion, regional left lateral displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault (> 45\u00a0km) reactivated ancient normal faults as right-lateral faults (e.g., El Monje and Surat\u00e1 faults). In these rigid blocks, deformation is dissipated with systematic vertical axis rotations ranging up to about 90\u00b0, and the magnetic fabric data show that these rocks preserve primary fabrics. During the Early Jurassic (time of deposition of the Jord\u00e1n and Nore\u00e1n formations), the tectonic blocks were located at shallow latitudes (Fig. 11A Supplementary materials 6). During the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, at the time of deposition of the La Rusia Formation and the Gir\u00f3n Group, those tectonics blocks had been translated into the northern hemisphere, at latitudes of ~4\u00b0 to ~7\u00b0N.

Quaternary faults are present and run through the country, including through metropolitan Seoul (Choi et al., 2012; Bae and Lee, 2016). Although past major earthquakes are known from historical recordings (Lee and Yang, 2006; Park et al., 2020), the Peninsula has until recent days been in a stable intraplate seismic state sandwiched between Eurasian, and Pacific-Philippine plates (Fig. 1\n). The 2011 Tohoku-Oki mega-thrust Mw 9.0 earthquake in Japan appears to have changed the situation resulting in more plus Mw 5.0 earthquakes being recorded in the Peninsula since 2011, compared to only 5 events since the 70s up to 2011 (Hong et al., 2018). It resulted in coseismic displacements of ~2\u20134\u00a0cm around the east and west coasts of the Korean Peninsula and weakened the Korean crust, likely and partly increasing the seismic activity (Hong et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2018). This includes the 2016 Mw 5.4 (ML 5.8) Gyeongju earthquake, the largest event recorded in the history of recent seismic monitoring in South Korea.\nSouth Korea is a densely populated country including metropolitan Seoul area that hosts over 20 million inhabitants. Any major earthquake in the region can be a significant threat to the people as well as can give damages to historical buildings. It is therefore essential that active faults and the relationship(s) between triggering mechanisms and fault geometry are identified for better earthquake magnitude estimations (Leonard, 2010; Malehmir et al., 2016), preparedness, and city planning. However, due to the high population density, mapping of these fault systems is challenging in this noisy and logistically difficult mega-city environment. There is a great need for improved understating of subsurface geology in major cities, especially since many mega-cities are in regions of high geohazard risks (Zoback et al., 2010). Geophysical methods such as seismics can be useful for this purpose (Malehmir et al., 2011). Ambient vibrational noise is however a major challenge for urban seismic data acquisition, as well as ground-receiver coupling (Brodic et al., 2015; Malehmir et al., 2015). Encouraging results obtained in city environment using new acquisition setups and systems such as digital sensors (Malehmir et al., 2016; Malehmir et al., 2017; Kammann et al., 2019) can be used in mega-cities to define the deep geometry of faults and its relationship with seismicity clusters. For this reason, two reflection seismic profiles (Fig. 1) were planned and acquired during November 2020, which are the focus of this study.\n\n\n2\nBackground geology and seismicity\nKorean peninsula sits in the Eurasian plate at the contact with the west Pacific-Philippine plate (Fig. 1). The basement rocks are cut by various rifts forming, in the Palaeozoic period, linear basement features, and in Mesozoic and Cenozoic, troughs filled with thick continental clastic sediments (Kim, 1997). Tectonic evolution of the peninsula can be divided into three phases (Kim, 1997) namely (1) ancient geosyncline stage that occurred during Archean (2.6\u00a0Ga) to Proterozoic (1.8\u00a0Ga), (2) stable platform stage that occurred during Middle Proterozoic (1.7\u00a0Ga) to Late Palaeozoic (260\u00a0Ma) and (3) an intense stage influenced by the movement of the west Pacific plate during Mesozoic (230\u00a0Ma) to Holocene (present). The latter stage is more significant when studying the fault systems, magmatism, and deformation evolution of basement rocks. It is generally believed that quaternary tectonics are related to volcanic activities and that basement faults formed during the Mesozoic are responsible for much of the seismicity observed in the region.\nThe South Korean government has supported several initiatives to study the current state of seismicity and map active faults in the country. Based on these studies (Hong et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2021), two sites were chosen for the reflection seismic surveys (Fig. 1a). Seismic activity was a primary consideration in choosing the sites (Fig. 1a). Profile 1 was positioned on the northern side of the metropolitan Seoul and profile 2 in the central part of the city. Both profiles cross the Chugaryeong crustal-scale fault where seismicity appears to show a spatial relationship with the fault. The Pocheon and Wangsukcheon faults, mapped east of the Chugaryeong fault (Fig. 1b), appear to form splay faults as they reach in the city south of profile 2. The Pocheon fault is mapped approximately 17\u00a0km east of profile 1 and immediately east of profile 2 (Fig. 1c). Other fault systems are likely also present between the Chugaryeong and Pocheon faults but covered or have no surface expressions. Recent focal mechanism data (Fig. 1c) along the Chugaryeong fault show a near-vertical (or steep) strike-slip sense of movement (Hong et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nReflection seismic data\nTwo 9\u00a0t vibrators (Figs. 2 and 3\n\n and supplementary Fig. S1) in a phase-locked time-synchronized manner were used to acquire the data. Along profile 1, four repeated sweeps at every shot location were used while for profile 2 five sweeps were used. The data quality is relatively good along profile 1 with occasionally strong reflections even observed in the raw shot gathers (Fig. 4\n) while along profile 2 data are much noisier. For profile 2, first arrivals were only occasionally observed beyond 3\u00a0km and, in most cases, limited to 500\u20131000\u00a0m offsets.\nThe processing steps and parameters were chosen and tailored to enhance the reflectivity in the data as much as possible. The landstreamer data processing focused on the bedrock reflection while the wireless data aimed at deeper reflections. The top 200\u00a0ms of the merged data is from the landstreamer. The wireless data cannot image the bedrock as the overburden effect is removed during the refraction static corrections and the receiver spacing between the wireless recorders is rather large (i.e., 20\u00a0m) for this purpose. Along profile 1, data processing of the wireless data focused on two-time windows: (1) top 2\u00a0s and (2) 2\u20134\u00a0s data. This strategy was needed as the uppermost 2\u00a0s contain significant surface-wave energy that required median and FK (frequency-wavenumber) filtering. After separate processing, the two datasets were merged amplitude levelled and migrated together.\n\n3.1\nSeismic data acquisition\nData triggering was done via a GPS (global system positioning) time disciplined data acquisition system connected to the streamer and towed by the so-called observer\/recording source (second mini-vib behind, Fig. 3). The source points were positioned between the two mini-vibs at the receiver stations. The min-vibs are approximately 8\u00a0m long. The data acquisition equipped with a GPS-antenna provided microsecond accuracy time sampling and stamping of the active source data on the landstreamer sensors. This time stamping of the active sources in the streamer data were later used to extract their corresponding data from the wireless recorders that were operating in an autonomous mode (passive) during the survey (Fig. S1). Prior to the data acquisition, we spent one full day to optimize sweep parameters and made sure that data quality was sufficient and the two mini-vibs operated simultaneously in a phase-locked manner. The sweep tests included change in the frequency ranges and lengths. We used our earlier experience from crystalline-setting surveys to optimize the testing and limit the number of sweep variables. The sweep tests ranged from 10 to 120\u00a0Hz (12, 14, 16 and 18\u00a0s) as well as 10\u2013140\u00a0Hz and 5\u2013140\u00a0Hz (Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). We noted that the starting 5-Hz sweeps had much more surface-wave energy excited in the data hence decided to use 10\u00a0Hz as the starting frequency and 140\u00a0Hz as the ending one (Table 1\n). For the sweep length, 18\u00a0s produced higher quality data than others tested thus chosen for the data acquisition guaranteeing that low frequencies would have sufficient energy for deeper penetrations.\nAnalysis of the data along profile 2 suggests that occasionally receiver gathers have much higher data quality than the shot gathers. This implies while the ambient noise is high in the city, ground coupling is the main reason for the relatively poor data quality; i.e., where the ground coupling of geophones is good, reasonable quality data with even reflections are observed (c.f., a shot gather against receiver gather in Fig. 7\n).\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic data processing\nBandpass and spectral equalization were effective to partly handle strong surface-waves in the data. Spectral balancing was also applied poststack as well as coherency improvement filters such as FX-deconvolution. Various migration algorithms were applied; however, phase shift migration produced the least migration artefacts and was selected. Different velocities were used for the migration; for profile 1, a 1D velocity between 4000 and 6300\u00a0m\/s was used. For the time-to-depth conversion we used a constant velocity of 6000\u00a0m\/s. Slight changes in the dip (5\u201310 degrees) and positioning (100\u2013300\u00a0m) of the reflections can consequently be expected but this is not so significant for the scale of this study.\nThe important processing steps were refraction static corrections, prestack data enhancement and velocity analysis (Table 2\n). Velocity analysis was important because of the steep and sometimes conflicting dips. The streamer and wireless data were processed separately and then merged later (supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Along profile 1, data processing of the wireless data focused on two different time windows: (1) top 2\u00a0s and (2) 2\u20134\u00a0s data. Once the two parts were processed and imaged, they were then merged and using a levelling amplitude algorithm (Place and Malehmir, 2016), the data amplitudes between the two parts were adjusted (Fig. 8\n).\nAlong profile 2, apart from the conventional processing workflow like that applied along profile 1, a major time and effort was put into removing noisy traces and analysing which receiver gathers had good quality data (Fig. 7) to allow partial stacking of their reflections. This strategy helped to image the steepest reflections observed on the city profile (R4 in supplementary Fig. S4). Given the extreme crooked nature of the profile, we also performed cross-dip analysis (Malehmir et al., 2011) to benefit from the midpoint cloud distributions and make sure reflections not favouring the orientation of the profile could still be imaged and their out-of-the-plane nature identified. This resulted, for example, in a better imaging of a reflection (R5 in supplementary Fig. S4) observed at the most curved location of the profile.\nComplex reflectivity is observed along profile 2 however profile 1 shows better correlation between reflectivity and the clusters of seismicity. A temporal and spatial correction is evident (Fig. 9\n). To complement the bedrock reflection imaging of the landstreamer data, first-break traveltime tomography was also implemented on wireless data since they have much higher offsets than the landstreamer (40\u2013240\u00a0m depending on which profile).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nProfile 1 is rich in reflectivity from bedrock down to 4\u00a0s (approximately 12\u00a0km depth). An increase in bedrock depth on the landstreamer section has a corresponding velocity decrease and coincides with a gap in the shallow reflectivity where two sets of reflections (R1 and R2) are interrupted by a vertical zone of non-reflectivity (Fig. 10\n). A set of moderately westerly-dipping reflections are also imaged at approximately 4\u20134.5\u00a0km depth and at 8\u20139\u00a0km depth, a series of steep reflections. These two sets of reflectivity bands terminate at two clusters of seismicity. From the source mechanism and the reflectivity pattern, we position the location of the Chugaryeong fault between R1 and R2 as a subvertical fault (Fig. 10a) where an increase in bedrock depth is also observed suggesting a zone of crushed and disturbed rocks. The near-vertical zone of decreased amplitudes between the two sets of reflectivity (R1 and R2) would then be due to no coherent structures to generate reflections.\nThe two clusters of seismicity and reflectivity intersect each other at 4\u20134.5\u00a0km and 8\u20139\u00a0km depth. The seismicity is dominantly locked at the intersections of these three features in the reflection seismic section (Fig. 10b). While there are other smaller features in the seismic section (e.g., the western margin of the section), only the key reflections are focused here. S2 sets of reflectivity appear to be a thicker package, implying an extensive fault or shear zone. However, the most continuous reflective zone intersects the deeper cluster of seismicity.\nAlong profile 2, the images are rather complex showing a strong westerly-dipping reflective band (S3 in Fig. 11\n) on the easternmost side of the profile, extending from the surface down to approximately 1200\u00a0m depth, like S1 reflectivity along profile 1 but at much shallower depths (Fig. 10c), and although about 70\u00a0km to the north, so highly speculative. From surface geological mappings and seismicity data (Fig. 1), a fault can be interpreted where S1 reflectivity is interrupted, extending down to where the seismicity is observed. The bedrock is not well imaged since a limited number of landstreamer sensors were used due to the logistical challenges in the city. The seismicity occurs at 7\u20139\u00a0km depth on the westernmost portion of profile 2 and mainly in this cluster. It occurs at a region of distinct discontinuous reflectivity (e.g., between R3 and R4 in Fig. 11). From the surface expression of topography and subsurface reflectivity patterns, a series of interrupted curved-shaped geological features can be interpreted. These features are likely due to a series of fault systems rather than lithology. The noise level is rather high in the city, and it is not possible to image deeper than 1500\u00a0m. Surface geological mapping suggests that most faults in the region are steep to vertical, although the lack of sufficient exposure and road cuts hinder definite identification of the fault geometries.\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nReflection sections from the two profiles indicate a direct relationship between the clustered seismicity and reflectivity. The Chugaryeong fault is sub-vertical as it cuts through reflections R1 and R2 and the two sets of reflectivity (S1 and S2) represent splay faults or zones of deformation associated with it. The S1 and S2 deeper bands of reflectivity are either smaller faults between the Pocheon and Wangsukcheon fault systems or being parts of the faults themselves, especially since the Pocheon fault may show itself on the city profile. The Chugaryeong fault is seismically active, and mainly locked at the intersections of these splay faults. The oblique shortening (Fig. 1a) is responsible for the strike-slip faulting at these fault intersections. Similar observations are also reported elsewhere from intracontinental, and splay thrust faults (Jackson, 1992; Jackson, 2002) where counter-clockwise rotation around the vertical axis triggers strike-slip displacement. This observation is important for both public safety consideration and for understanding how future earthquakes may be triggered and at what depth. The Pocheon fault may be also more moderately dipping than earlier thought.\nThe interconnection between seismicity and subsidiary faults has earlier been suggested elsewhere by several authors, however, mainly based on seismological observations (Walters et al., 2018) or where reflection data available in different geological settings (Ahmadi et al., 2015), and large uncertainty in locating the events and without any direct evidence from the subsurface. Fluid diffusion, channelled along fault intersections, is argued for the re-initiation of earthquakes. Interestingly, Gangopadhyay and Talwani (2005), through numerical modelling, also argued that fault intersections, at the presence of a weak crust, are ideal locations for stress build-ups and seismicity(Talwani, 1988). However, they had no subsurface images to support their claim. Furthermore, fault intersections and subsequent stress build-ups are observed to trigger strike slip motions on major faults because of kinematic adjustment and followed by vertical or horizontal movement on the splay faults (Talwani, 1988). These are consistent with the seismicity records along the two profiles and our interpretation of the fault intersections as the controlling factor of seismicity in the region. Notably, the well-known 2017 Pohang earthquake (Mw 5.4) in South Korea is thought to be associated with multiple fault intersections and geometries (Son et al., 2020). This further emphasizes why it is critical to image fault systems in the subsurface and integrate seismological studies with active-source reflection seismic data.\nThe seismicity not only spatially correlates with the fault intersections but also correlates in time (temporally), implying a start-stop mechanism for triggering and re-initiation of seismic events along the Chugaryeong fault. These observations are unique and open up for possibilities to predict where and possibly within what period earthquakes may occur. For the same magnitude seismic event, if geomechanically possible, shallower seismic events can be much more worrying than deeper ones when seismic risks are considered. Our data and the switching between depth and time provide for the first time a window of opportunity for studying risks and predicting potential hazards due to seismicity in the region. Long-term monitoring of seismicity is highly recommended to shed light into the interpretations provided in this study.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nTwo high-resolution high-fold reflection seismic profiles were acquired in the metropolitan Seoul, South Korea, for studying fault systems with the aim of helping to explain the current seismicity in the Peninsula after the devastating 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. The northern profile presents a reflectivity-seismicity relationship. The city and northern profiles have one important feature in common and that is the reflective character from the same fault zone, which we have interpreted to be a splay fault from the sub-vertical Chugaryeong fault. It is an important observation for the citizens in a megacity like Seoul and it is worth verifying. This interpretation along with the observation of clustered seismicity associated with the reflectivity implies that much of the current seismicity in the Korean Peninsula is controlled both temporarily and spatially at the intersection of fault systems forming a major flower structure showing a start-stop faulting mechanism that is both temporally and spatiality controlled at the fault intersections.\n\n\nData availability\nThe seismicity data analysed in this study were collected from the website of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA, http:\/\/www. kma.go.kr). The reflection seismic data are being archived in the Swedish National Data Service (https:\/\/www.snd.gu.se) and additional hard copies are presented in the Supporting Information in the form of shot records and final seismic sections.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nT.-K\u00b7H initiated the project.

The Bohemian Massif developed approximately between 500 and 250\nMa during a period of large-scale crustal convergence, subduction, collision of continental plates and microplates as well as post-collisional extension (Matte et al., 1990). Nowadays, this region is situated at the junction of three different Variscan tectonic units and is characterized by the intersection of the ENE-WSW trending Oh\u0159e (Eger) Rift and a multitude of different fault systems. The Oh\u0159e Rift is part of the seismically active European Cenozoic Rift System and represents its easternmost termination (Ziegler, 1992; Prodehl et al., 2006). The entire area currently shows activity from magmatic processes in the intra-continental lithospheric mantle (e.g Geissler et al., 2005; Br\u00e4uer et al., 2009; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2018), similar to the Basin and Range Province in the western United States (Jarchow et al., 1993) or the Eifel and the Massif Central in Europe (Ziegler, 1992; Prodehl et al., 1995). These processes take place in the absence of active volcanism at surface, but are expressed by a series of phenomena, including e.g. the occurrence of repeated earthquake swarms (e.g. Hor\u00e1lek and Fischer, 2009; Fischer et al., 2014, and references therein) and massive degassing of mantle derived CO2 in the form of mineral springs and mofettes (e.g. Br\u00e4uer et al., 2005, 2008; K\u00e4mpf et al., 2013; Weinlich, 2014). Mofettes are sites of natural, cold, magmatogene CO2 degassing (Flechsig et al., 2008) and can occur as dry as well as wet mofettes. In the latter case, the gas is transported through water close to the surface and the dissolved CO2 causes an increase of the electrical conductivity within fluids.\nActive tectonics in the study area is mainly manifested by Cenozoic volcanism represented by different Quaternary volcanic structures e.g. two scoria cones (\u017delezn\u00e1 and Komorn\u00ed h\u016frka) and several maar structures (e.g. Mrlina et al., 2009; Rohrm\u00fcller et al., 2018; Mrlina et al., 2019; Ho\u0161ek et al., 2019) some tens of kilometres away from the zone of earthquake swarms. Based on geo-thermobarometry, a depth range of 25 to 40\nkm is assumed to be the intrusion level for the alkaline melts in the past and also presently (Geissler et al., 2007). All these phenomena make the Oh\u0159e Rift a unique target area for European intra-continental geo-scientific research. Therefore, an interdisciplinary drilling programme advancing the field of earthquake-fluid-rock-biosphere interaction was funded within the scope of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP, Dahm et al., 2013, 2016). This programme continues and expands previous active seismic and passive monitoring experiments as well as magnetotelluric (MT) experiments (e.g. DEKORP Research Group, 1987; \u010cerv et al., 1997a, 1997b; Enderle et al., 1998; \u010cerv et al., 2001; Eisel et al., 2001; Oettinger et al., 2001; Grad et al., 2008; Hrubcov\u00e1 et al., 2013; Mullick et al., 2015) over the last decade to study the crustal and upper mantle structure mainly in the context of the former KTB drilling at Windisch-Eschenbach, Germany (Kontinentale Tiefbohrprogramm der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (KTB); Emmermann and Lauterjung, 1997, and references therein). Since the activities were widespread in the area, the overarching goals were to study (i) the nature of geophysical structures and phenomena, (ii) the crustal stress field and the brittle-ductile transition, (iii) the thermal structure of the crust, (iv) crustal fluids and transport processes, and (v) structure and evolution of the central European Variscan basement. Within the context of the Eger Rift ICDP, a central goal has been the understanding of the physical and chemical processes and interaction that lead to the magma and fluid transport through the lithosphere and crust as well as the processes that lead to the observed earthquake swarms as the cause of all these processes is still enigmatic for an intraplate setting. Several local geo-scientific studies (e.g. Weinlich et al., 1998; Br\u00e4uer et al., 2003, 2008; Hor\u00e1lek and Fischer, 2009; K\u00e4mpf et al., 2013; Weinlich et al., 2013; Weinlich, 2014; Nickschick et al., 2015) suggest that fluid circulation along deep-reaching faults seems to play a crucial role in explaining the underlying geodynamic processes.\nElectromagnetic (EM) methods are suitable to identify and image possible fluid pathways as a strong contrast in electrical resistivity is expected between the resistive crystalline basement and conductive fluids as well as partial melts (e.g. Haak and Hutton, 1986; Simpson and Bahr, 2005; Chave and Jones, 2012). To resolve conductive structures down to the middle crust, the MT method is essential as it is the only EM method capable of reaching such depths. In the past, this method has been applied successfully to image crustal fluids in a variety of geological contexts, like the Tibetan Plateau (Unsworth et al., 2005; Bai et al., 2010), the Japanes back arc (Ogawa et al., 2001, 2014), the Dead Sea (Meqbel et al., 2016), the Barberton Greenstone Belt (K\u00fctter et al., 2016), the San Andreas Fault (Becken et al., 2011) or in different (intraplate) volcanic fields or systems (e.g. Aivazpourporgou et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2020; Comeau et al., 2022). First MT measurements within the ICDP framework were carried out in 2015\/2016 along two 50\nkm long perpendicular profiles with 30 stations each and a dense grid of 97 stations close to the mofettes with an extension of 10\nx\n5\nkm\n2. Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) present 2D images along a N-S profile. They reveal a conductive channel at the earthquake swarm region that extends from the lower crust to the surface forming a pathway for fluids into the region of the mofettes. A second conductive channel is present in the south of their model. Due to the given station setup, the resulting 2D inversions allow ambiguous interpretations of this feature. 3D MT data and inversions are required to distinguish between different scenarios and to fully describe the 3D structure of the subsurface. Therefore, we conducted a large MT field experiment in 2018 by extending the study area towards the south. Broad-band (10\u22124\u00a0\u2212\u00a0103\n\ns) MT data were measured at 83 stations along three 50\u00a0\u2212\u00a075\nkm long profiles and some additional stations across the region of the maars, the A\u0161-Tachov fault and the suture zones allowing for 2D as well as 3D inversion on a crustal scale. To improve the data quality, advanced data processing techniques were applied leading to good quality transfer functions. Furthermore, the previously collected MT data were reprocessed using new processing approaches. This entire MT data set across the Oh\u0159e Rift environment together with old MT data collected within the framework of the site characterization in the surrounding of the KTB drilling are used to compute a comprehensive 3D resistivity model of the subsurface. The 3D inversion result will be introduced and discussed. Furthermore, 2D inversion studies using real and synthetic data were conducted and the results will be compared to the 3D result.\n\n\n2\nTectonic and geological setting\n\n2.1\nThe survey area\nThe region of West Bohemia and Upper Palatinate at the border between the Czech Republic and Germany (Fig. 1a) belongs to the western part of the Bohemian Massif. The Bohemian Massif is one of the largest stable outcrops of pre-Permian rocks in Central and Western Europe (Matte et al., 1990; Fischer et al., 2014) and is located on the territory of the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and Austria. The Bohemian Massif was formed during the Variscan cycle resulting from the convergence and collision between two major continents, Laurentia-Baltica-Avalonia and Gondwana with several small microplates, after the closure of various ocean basins, followed by obduction, continental collision, continental subduction, and strike-slip faulting between 500 and 250\nMa (e.g. Hrubcov\u00e1 et al., 2005; Grygar, 2016; Plomerov\u00e1 et al., 2016). It is one of the most significant and extensive fragments of the Variscan orogeny (Matte et al., 1990; Hrubcov\u00e1 et al., 2005; Grygar, 2016). Based on differences in structure and geological evolution, the Bohemian Massif can be divided into (i) the Saxothuringian Unit, (ii) the Tepl\u00e1-Barrandian Unit, (iii) the Moldanubian Unit and (iv) the Moravo-Silesian Unit (Grygar, 2016).\nNorthwest Bohemia is located within the transition zone of the first three tectonic units (Fig. 1b) with the Saxothuringian in the north and the Tepl\u00e1-Barrandian and the Moldanubian unit in the south (Geissler et al., 2005; Br\u00e4uer et al., 2014). The different units are separated by significant sutures and fault zones (Grad et al., 2008; Grygar, 2016). Since the Lower Triassic the Paleozoic sutures between the Saxothuringian and the Tepl\u00e1-Barrandian\/Moldanubian units have been reactivated repeatedly as a result of the Alpine collision (Ziegler, 1992; Fischer et al., 2014; Hrubcov\u00e1 et al., 2017).\nProminent tectonic structures of the western part of the Bohemian Massif are the Cenozoic ENE-WSW trending Oh\u0159e Rift with the central Oh\u0159e Graben, the N-S trending Regensburg-Leipzig-Rostock Zone (RLRZ) and the NNW-SSE trending Cheb\u2013Doma\u017elice Graben (e.g. Bankwitz et al., 2003; Br\u00e4uer et al., 2003; Mrlina et al., 2009). Intraplate stress originating in the Alpine collision zone as well as alkaline magmatic activity during the Cenozoic led to the development of the Oh\u0159e Rift (D\u00e8zes et al., 2004; Dahm et al., 2013; Fischer et al., 2014). At present times, the Oh\u0159e Rift is 300\nkm long and 70\nkm wide and is located at the northern border of the Bohemian Massif separating the Saxothuringian and Tepl\u00e1-Barrandian unit (Br\u00e4uer et al., 2003; Geissler et al., 2005; Heuer et al., 2006). The Oh\u0159e Rift is the easternmost part of the seismically active European Cenozoic Rift System, which evolved as a consequence of passive rifting due to compressional stresses during the Alpine and Pyrenean collision (Ziegler, 1992; Plomerov\u00e1 et al., 2016). The 700\nkm long and 40\nkm wide RLRZ is a network of many local faults striking in N-S, NW-SE directions and sometimes also E-W direction (Bankwitz et al., 2003; Fischer et al., 2014; Nickschick et al., 2015). The most important tectonic zones of the RLRZ in the Cheb Basin are the NNW-SSE striking approximately 100\nkm long Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b fault zone (MLFZ) and the Po\u010datky-Plesn\u00e1 fault zone (PPZ) (Br\u00e4uer et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2014). Parallel to the MLFZ runs the A\u0161-Tachov fault (Fig. 1c); both belong to the younger faults in this region. The ENE-WSW striking main faults of the Oh\u0159e Rift form a distinctive Y-shaped structure up to a depth of 15\nkm (Weinlich et al., 1998, 2013; Weinlich, 2014). Furthermore, there exist several NNE-SSW striking deep faults as well as nearly N-S trending faults such as the PPZ (Weinlich et al., 2013; Weinlich, 2014, and references therein). The Cheb\u2013Doma\u017elice Graben is located in the eastern part of the RLRZ and is bounded by the MLFZ to the east and the A\u0161-Tachov fault in the west (Fischer et al., 2014; Weinlich, 2014). The Cheb\u2013Doma\u017elice Graben intersects the Oh\u0159e Rift and Oh\u0159e Graben forming the Cheb Basin (Weinlich, 2014; Nickschick et al., 2019). The Cheb Basin, a small intra-cratonic basin at the northwest corner of the Bohemian Massif, developed during the Upper Tertiary and represents the western termination of the Oh\u0159e Graben (Bankwitz et al., 2003). The Cheb Basin is filled with up to 300\nm thick sediments of Tertiary and Quaternary age (Br\u00e4uer et al., 2003; Fischer et al., 2014). It is the youngest geological feature in northwest Bohemia (Mousavi et al., 2015).\nThe western part of the Bohemian Massif belongs to one of the geodynamically most active regions within central Europe and the European Cenozoic Rift System (Plomerov\u00e1 et al., 2016). The entire region is characterized by ongoing magmatic processes in the intra-continental lithospheric mantle (e.g. Geissler et al., 2005; Br\u00e4uer et al., 2009; K\u00e4mpf et al., 2013), caused by active magmatic underplating (Geissler et al., 2007; Hrubcov\u00e1 et al., 2017). These processes take place in the absence of active volcanism at surface, but are expressed by a series of phenomena, including e.g. massive degassing of mantle derived CO2 in form of mineral springs as well as dry and wet mofettes in several degassing fields along tectonic fault zones (e.g. Dahm et al., 2013; K\u00e4mpf et al., 2013; Weinlich, 2014) and the occurrence of repeated earthquake swarms (e.g. Hor\u00e1lek and Fischer, 2009; Fischer et al., 2014, and references therein). Active tectonics is mainly manifested by Cenozoic volcanism and neotectonic crustal movements. Seismic studies reveal a complex crustal structure with a wide zone of increased reflectivity in the lower crust at the crust-mantle transition. These lower crustal seismic velocity anomalies can be interpreted as shear zones partly filled with fluids and\/or small magmatic intrusions or partial melting that is further suggested by mantle xenoliths (Geissler et al., 2005, 2007). Combined seismological, isotopic and mantle xenolith studies provide evidence that magma accumulation takes place at two different depth levels within the lithospheric mantle at \u224860\nkm and \u224825\u00a0\u2212\u00a035\nkm depth (Geissler et al., 2005, 2007; Heuer et al., 2006). An updoming of the Moho to 25\u00a0\u2212\u00a027\nkm depth beneath the western Oh\u0159e Rift as well as an updoming of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to 65\u00a0\u2212\u00a090\nkm depth (Babu\u0161ka and Plomerov\u00e1, 2001; Heuer et al., 2006), which may include increased partial melt, may represent the common source that supplies the different reservoirs at the crust-mantle boundary (e.g. Ziegler, 1992; Geissler et al., 2005; Heuer et al., 2006). Furthermore, based on different long-term behaviour and levels of the 3He\/4He ratio, Br\u00e4uer et al. (2008, 2014) suggest that the upper mantle derived fluids could be supplied from several small spatially separated reservoirs at the crust-mantle boundary with accumulated magma derived from the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. A similar observation of an upwelling lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary related to Quaternary volcanism can be found in Algeria (Beccaluva et al., 2007). The complex system of deep reaching faults in this region provides the conditions for the ascent of magmatic CO2 and forms the only viable migration pathways in the crystalline basement (Weinlich, 2014). The deep seated Y-shaped fault structure of the Oh\u0159e Rift splits the ascending magmatic gases at a depth of about 15\nkm and form several separated degassing centres as well as gas-free zones (Weinlich et al., 1998, 2013). The most prominent degassing centres are the Cheb Basin with the spa Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b (FL) and the spas Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b (ML) and Karlovy Vary (KV) with their numerous mineral springs. In addition, hot springs occur in KV (Weinlich et al., 1998, 2013). In the Cheb Basin, the portion of mantle derived helium was the highest at the PPZ, where the subcontinental helium isotope signature indicates fluid transport pathways down to the deep lithospheric mantle (Fischer et al., 2014).\nThe intersection area of the Oh\u0159e Rift and the RLRZ is furthermore characterized by periodically occurring earthquake swarms with seismic magnitudes up to ML 5 (Heuer et al., 2006; Dahm et al., 2013; Fischer et al., 2014), although the Bohemian Massif is located considerably far away from existing plate boundaries and active volcanoes (Mousavi et al., 2015). Intraplate earthquake swarms without active volcanism are unusual and occur mostly in areas of enhanced crustal fluid activity and in regions with Quaternary volcanism, like the French Central Massif, the Eifel region, Long Valley (California) or Colorado (Hor\u00e1lek and Fischer, 2009). The youngest volcanoes in West Bohemia belong to the late-rift period (16\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.26\nMa) volcanism (Ulrych et al., 2011). The Quaternary activity seems to be restricted to the western border of the Cheb Basin along the A\u0161-Tachov fault (Hrubcov\u00e1 et al., 2017) and is represented by the two scoria cones \u017delezn\u00e1 and Komorn\u00ed h\u016frka (Eisen- and Kammerb\u00fchl) as well as by several maar structures such as the M\u00fdtina and the Neualbenreuth Maar.\nThe areas of Moho updoming, CO2 emanations and earthquake swarm activities overlap each other indicating ongoing processes in the lithosphere (Heuer et al., 2006). Eighty percent of the seismic energy within the last 25\u00a0years was released near Nov\u00fd Kostel (NK) village (see Fig. 1c), which is spatially correlated with the PPZ (Fischer et al., 2014). As there are no gas exhalations directly above the hypocentres in the vicinity of NK, low-permeable rock units seem to cap the active hydraulic system. The permeability barriers keep the permanent fluid flux from rising further and may be responsible for the increase of the fluid pressure that triggers seismicity (Br\u00e4uer et al., 2005).\n\n\n2.2\nExisting electrical resistivity studies\nInformation on the electrical resistivities of the crystalline basement of the Bohemian Massif and the overlaying geological layers are available from several previous geo-electrical investigations such as MT studies and large- and small-scale electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) experiments. The obtained resistivity models reveal high resistivity values of several hundreds to several thousands \u03a9m for the crystalline basement and lower resistivity values in the Cheb Basin, at mofettes, for the sedimentary infill of the maars and for regions with fluid interaction.\nSeveral MT studies were conducted in the context of the KTB site in the Upper Palatinate located approximately 10\nkm west of the current study area (see e.g. \u010cerv et al., 1997a, 1997b; Eisel and Haak, 1999). All of them stress the highly complex geological structure of this region and mention a rather 3D character of the corresponding MT data. Furthermore, these studies emphasize a consistent southern orientation of the real induction vectors (in Wiese convention; Wiese, 1962) for longer periods indicating a conductive structure in the north. Consistent with this hypothesis, Eisel and Haak (1999) state that a strong conductor at the northern end of their profile (that correspond more or less to the northern end of the current study area) is necessary to explain these induction vectors. However, due to limited technical possibilities at that time, the data were almost exclusively explained by 1D and 2D models. Thereby, crustal-scale anisotropic blocks were included to mainly fit the induction vectors together with the observed impedances. In addition, a strong focus was set on shallow macro-anisotropy of the electrical conductivity since borehole logs and samples as well as geological results in the immediate vicinity of the KTB in the Zone Erbendorf-Vohenstrauss (\u010cerv et al., 1997a) indicated graphite, pyrite and brines in fractured sequences. Whether and to what extent this is transferable to the current study area remains unclear as only some stations in the south can be associated with the Zone Erbendorf-Vohenstrauss, if at all. Moreover, \u010cerv et al. (1997a) state that the anisotropy generally decreases towards the east.\nAnother MT experiment was conducted by Di Mauro et al. (1999) northeast of NK. They report that huge blocks with large anisotropy observed in the close vicinity of the KTB site seem to finish abruptly several kilometres southwest of their target area and thus west of the current study area. They, too, confirm the rather 3D character of the MT data in this region. Their 3D forward model, obtained on the basis of 2D inversion models, displays high resistivity values of the crystalline basement with resistivities >104\n\u03a9m for greater depths and much smaller resistivity values for the sediments of the Cheb Basin (10\u03a9m).\nRecent information about the regional distribution of electrical resistivity came from a MT experiment carried out by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) within the ICDP project. They measured five-component broad-band MT data along two perpendicular profiles crossing the Cheb Basin and a denser grid of stations close to the mofettes Bubl\u00e1k and Hartou\u0161ov. So far, only 2D inversion results of the N-S profile using solely impedance data are published. Large parts of the models presented by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) show high resistivities (>1000\u03a9m) related to the old crystalline basement. Near the surface lower resistivity values are obtained (<30\u03a9m), especially in the Cheb Basin beneath the Bubl\u00e1k and Hartou\u0161ov mofette fields. The most prominent feature in their models is a conductive channel in the vicinity of the earthquake swarm region NK that extends from the lower crust (\u224825\nkm depth) to the surface forming a pathway for fluids into the region of the mofettes. Another conductive channel is present in the south of their models. However, with the given 2D station setup, this feature could not be unambiguously explained. Furthermore, the depth and steepness of this second conductive channel could not be resolved robustly.\nA first 3D model of the two regional profiles measured by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) has just recently been obtained in the framework of a master's thesis (Mair, 2020). Mair (2020) presented results of a joint 3D inversion of impedance and vertical transfer functions. The final 3D model is dominated by high resistivities up to 62,000\u03a9m. In contrast, much lower resistivities (<1\u03a9m) are resolved close to the mofettes. The most prominent structures are two sub-vertical conductors, which merge into one from a depth of 16\nkm on forming a conductive reservoir from a depth below 20\nkm with average resistivities of 80\u03a9m and resistivities of 10\u03a9m in its central part. One of the two sub-vertical conductors forms a potential pathway for fluids to the mofettes fields and splits into several smaller branches close to the surface. The hypocentres of the earthquakes are located in the resistive host rock surrounding this conductor contrary to the 2D results of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018). The second sub-vertical conductor is located more in the northern part northwest of the earthquake swarm region.\nSeveral other electrical resistivity studies have been conducted in the area of interest such as ERT and Radio-MT experiments. All these methods have in common that they focus on small-scale areas as they have a much smaller penetration depth as the traditional MT method. Several field experiments were conducted using these methods for a characterization of the local electrical resistivity structure of the mofettes (Flechsig et al., 2008; Nickschick et al., 2015, 2019; Rulff et al., 2021), maars (Mrlina et al., 2009; Flechsig et al., 2015; Rohrm\u00fcller et al., 2018; Ho\u0161ek et al., 2019) or the surrounding of the KTB borehole (Storz et al., 2000). The obtained resistivities and their models are only marginally relevant for the current study as they only image the near surface reaching down to a depth of several tens to hundreds of metres. However, they underline that the investigation area is characterized by highly resistive rocks (> several hundreds to thousands \u03a9m) and that increased conductivity is often connected with the sedimentary infill of the Cheb Basin or the maars. Furthermore, they stress that decreased resistivities are observed for regions with known fluid interaction at e.g. wet mofettes. One of the deepest penetration depth with up to 4\nkm was reached by a large-scale ERT experiment conducted by Storz et al. (2000) in the close vicinity of the KTB. They resolve resistivity values >1,000\u03a9m reaching as far as 10\nkm east of the KTB. In contrast, Flechsig et al. (2008), Rulff et al. (2021), Nickschick et al. (2019) found clear correlation of an increased conductivity in areas characterized by an ascent and mixture of magmatic fluids such as CO2 with water.\n\n\n\n3\nMagnetotelluric data acquisition and processing\nThe MT method is a passive EM technique to image the electrical resistivity distribution of the subsurface by recording natural variations of the electric and magnetic fields at the Earth's surface. The electrical resistivity is a physical parameter that is particularly sensitive to the presence of high-conductive phases such as aqueous fluids, partial melts, mineralisations or metallic compounds. At each site, two orthogonal, horizontal components of the electric field and three orthogonal components of the magnetic field are measured. In the frequency domain, the different field components are linked by linear relationships which can be described through transfer functions. The period dependent transfer functions are obtained by MT time-series data processing and are subsequently used to model the subsurface electrical resistivity structure. The horizontal electric and magnetic field components are linked by the complex impedance tensor Z that is often visualized as magnitude in terms of apparent resistivity and phase. The vertical magnetic transfer function (VTF) linearly relates the vertical magnetic field component with the two horizontal magnetic field components and is often graphically represented by induction vectors.\nMagnetotelluric data of the current study were collected in autumn 2018 at 83 stations along two 75\nkm and one 50\nkm long NNE-SSW running profiles as well as some additional stations across the regions of the maars, the A\u0161-Tachov fault and the suture zones between the different Variscan tectonic units (Fig. 1). The data are published by Weckmann and Platz (2020).\nThe study area is located south from previous MT measurements within the PIER-ICDP project conducted in 2015 and 2016 by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018). The final results of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) indicate a conductive channel in the south whose origin could not be unambiguous resolved by the authors due to the given station setup. The station layout of the recently conducted data was designed to overcome this problem by allowing for 2D as well as for 3D inversions. A site spacing of approximately 3\nkm was chosen along the profiles due to the focus on regional structures, but it still allows the resolution of shallow features. At all stations five-component broad-band MT data were measured in the period range of 10\u22124\u00a0\u2212\u00a0103\n\ns using S.P.A.M. Mk IV magnetotelluric systems, Metronix induction coils and non-polarisable Ag\/AgCl electrodes from the Geophysical Instrument Pool Potsdam (GIPP). The recording time at each station was approximately three days, except for station 304 in southeast Bavaria which was used as a local reference station due to its high data quality. The data were processed using the Emerald software suite (Ritter et al., 1998; Weckmann et al., 2005; Krings, 2007). Some regions within the study area are heavily populated and therefore man-made EM noise deteriorates a significant fraction of the recorded time-series severely affecting the MT data quality. To overcome the problem of EM noise, robust single-site and robust remote reference processing were applied in combination with different notch and delay-line filters as well as advanced data selection criteria (Platz and Weckmann, 2019). In addition to the local reference site 304, we used data from the permanent remote station of GFZ located in Wittstock (Ritter et al., 2015) 325\u00a0\u2212\u00a0400\nkm north of the survey area. The most obvious outliers in the impedance data and the vertical magnetic transfer functions were manually removed prior to the inversion. Smooth curves could be obtained for the impedance tensor in the period range of 10\u22124\n\ns up to 1000\ns for many stations. Furthermore, we were able to obtain smooth and stable vertical transfer functions over a wide period range. In general, the data quality decreases from south to north. Moreover, stations close to larger towns as e.g. Weiden, Cheb, and ML are affected by EM noise, whereas more remote stations show noticeable better data quality. For inversion, the newly acquired data set was supplemented by selected and reprocessed stations from Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) measured in 2015 and 2016 as well as by some stations measured in 1996 in the context of the KTB programme.\n\nFig. 2\n displays apparent resistivity and phase curves as well as induction vector plots of three exemplary sites. The location of these three sites is marked in Fig. 1c. The impedance tensor data are shown in a geographic coordinate system (x \n\n=\n\u0302\n\n north, y \n\n=\n\u0302\n\n east). Station 306 is located in the southeastern part of the study area, which is characterized by underlying crystalline basement. The shown transfer functions vary smoothly with period. Both off-diagonal impedance tensor components show relatively high apparent resistivity values over the entire period range and large diagonal components for longer periods (T\u00a0>\u00a00.1\ns). The real and imaginary induction vectors are presented in Wiese convention (Wiese, 1962) in the lower panel. The real induction vectors for the shortest periods (T\u00a0<\u00a00.01\ns) are small and show values close to zero; longer induction vectors are visible for periods greater T\u00a0>\u00a00.1\ns. For the longest periods (T\u00a0>\u00a050\ns) the real induction vectors are oriented in S-SE direction. Site 007 is located near the M\u00fdtina Maar and the scoria cone \u017delezn\u00e1 h\u016frka. Here, we still observe high resistivity values for both off-diagonal components and the real induction vectors for the longest periods point towards S-SE. Site EMERES15_006 was measured during the EMERES project in 2015 and has a much higher noise content than the stations measured in 2018, especially for longer periods. The data of this station were reprocessed using the remote reference technique as well as novel pre-selection criteria leading to acceptable transfer functions (Mair, 2020). The apparent resistivities are at least 1\u20132 decades lower than the apparent resistivity values of the other two stations. This is consistent with the findings of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018), who observed consistently lower apparent resistivity values for stations located within the Cheb Basin. Furthermore, the drop in the apparent resistivity curves for periods longer T\u00a0>\u00a010\ns may be explained by a conductive structure at greater depths as this station is located close to several mofette fields. Therefore, we used these data points for the subsequent inversion although it cannot be ruled out that these periods are disturbed by noise. In general, we observe small real induction vectors close to zero for most stations for short periods (T\u00a0<\u00a00.01\ns) and larger real induction vectors for the longer periods. In the period range between 0.1\u00a0\u2212\u00a010\ns, the real induction vectors become largest for many stations pointing in several directions dependent of the site location (see Fig. 3a), indicating several spatially limited resistivity structures at depth. For longer periods (T\u00a0>\u00a050\ns) almost all real induction vectors are orientated in S-SE direction (see Fig. 3b) indicating a conductor in the north.\nFor the sites along the three longer profiles, the dimensionality of the MT data was determined using the ellipticity method after Becken and Burkhardt (2004, Fig. 4\n). Thereby, we analysed the dimensionality separately for different period ranges. In general, we observe a large variety of strike angles for the shortest periods for which these values are influenced by shallow structures and do not exhibit common induction spheres with their neighbouring sites. More consistent strike angles as shown by rose diagrams (circular histograms; Fig. 4) are obtained by using both, broader period ranges and longer periods.\nThe rose diagram for the westernmost profile (hereafter called profile 1; Fig. 4a) clearly shows a clustering of the strike directions of the single-site, multi-frequency strike around N70\u2218\nE (or N20\u2218\nW), which corresponds well to the best fit of the multi-site, multi-frequency approach with a strike angle of N68.9\u2218\nE (or N21.1\u2218\nW). To solve the inherent 90\u2218 ambiguity, we took the direction of the corresponding real induction vectors into account. They are mostly orientated in southeast direction indicating a strike angle of N68.9\u2218\nE for profile 1. In a similar manner, a strike angle of N74.5\u2218\nE for the central profile containing in addition the N-S profile acquired in 2015 (hereafter called profile 2) and a strike angle of N59.5\u2218\nE for the easternmost profile (hereafter called profile 3) were observed. As all obtained geo-electrical strikes point in NE-SW direction, we conclude that the strike direction in the corresponding period ranges are rather dominated by the ENE-WSW trending Oh\u0159e Rift than by the different NNW-SSE striking faults. This analysis suggests that the data can be explained by 2D structures in the subsurface. However, given the complex geology of the study area with prominent fault and graben systems running perpendicular to each other (e.g. the Oh\u0159e Rift and the PPZ or MLFZ), the presence of the sedimentary Cheb Basin in the north and the different mofette fields and Quaternary volcanoes structures, it is expected that the dimensionality analysis will exhibit 3D characteristics. In addition to the dimensionality analysis after Becken and Burkhardt (2004), we evaluated the phase tensors (see Fig. 3c-f; Caldwell et al., 2004). The distribution of all calculated phase tensor beta values for the entire masked data set in Fig. 3e reveals that 55% of the data points have an absolute value below 3\u2218, which is often referred to as a critical value for a reasonable 2D analysis. However, a more differentiated approach shows a correlation between the absolute beta value and the period for this data set (Fig. 3f). For short periods (T\u00a0<\u00a01.4\ns), the majority of all absolute beta values lies below 3\u2218; however, for longer periods most of the beta values are greater than 3\u2218 indicating a stronger influence of 3D structures. This is further demonstrated by means of two maps displaying the phase tensors colour-coded with the corresponding beta values for two different periods (Fig. 3c and d). Moreover, even for short periods, localized areas exist in e.g. the south or in the north close to the mofettes, where higher phase tensor beta values are observed probably due to a more complex subsurface structure. A 2D analysis can address the expected complex 3D geo-electrical structure of the subsurface only within certain limitations, especially as many relevant features will be located off-profile. Therefore, in this paper we will focus on a full-tensor 3D inversion of the entire data set described above.\n\n\n4\n3D resistivity inversion model\nFor 3D modelling and inversion we used the parallelized Modular Electromagnetic Inversion system ModEM (Meqbel, 2009; Egbert and Kelbert, 2012; Kelbert et al., 2014). To reduce the computational cost, only every second period of the entire data set were used resulting in 25 periods between 0.000173\u00a0\u2212\u00a02896\ns. The preferred 3D model presented in this study is obtained through inverting all components of the impedance tensor and the vertical transfer functions for 128 and 105 stations of the entire data set, respectively. The complete data set comprises all 84 stations of the recent field campaigns in 2018, plus 17 reprocessed stations measured in 2015, 7 reprocessed stations from 2016 and 20 stations of the entire KTB data set from 1996. However, most of the stations north of the mofettes measured in 2015 were excluded in order to have a more consistent and even station coverage and due to their poor data quality in comparison to the other data. This also allows a more focused and centred model.\n\n4.1\nModel setup and inversion strategy\nWe conducted more than 200 inversion runs to evaluate different inversion settings and parameters. Important parameters that were tested are e.g. the grid setup, the starting model, the smoothing parameters and the data errors. As a presentation of these tests is beyond the scope of this paper, we will only briefly summarize this point and specify the used parameters for our preferred model.\nAn initial step in the setup of a 3D model is the specification of an inversion coordinate system and an appropriate model grid. We used a coordinate system with x- and y-axis pointing towards geographic north and east, and the z-axis pointing downwards. The extensions of the grid were chosen much larger than the area of interest amounting to several skin depths in order to obtain accurate forward solutions. We counted on a fine enough parameterization of the model to allow for any near-surface effects, including topographic variations, which were not directly accounted for by the model. We varied the horizontal cell sizes from 750 to 2,500\nm trying equal as well as different lengths of the edges for both horizontal directions. Furthermore, we tested the dimension in the vertical direction by varying (i) the number of cells in the z-direction, (ii) the increasing factor (between 1.1\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.3) downwards and (iii) the thickness of the first cell (5\u00a0\u2212\u00a020\nm). This first cell also determines the thickness of the first, near-ground air layer that also increases logarithmically upwards. Our finally selected grid consists in total of 112\u00a0\u00d7\u00a090\u00a0\u00d7\u00a042 cells covering a modelling area of roughly 9,200\nkm (N-S or x direction) by 9,200\nkm (E-W or y direction). The inner grid consists of 62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040 cells with a uniform horizontal dimension of 1.5\nkm. The padding cells have an increasing factor of 1.3. In the vertical direction, 42 layers are logarithmically increasing by a factor of 1.3 from 20\nm for the first layer down to a total depth of 4,000\nkm. This depth should be sufficient and represents several skin depths, e.g. more than eight assuming an average resistivity of 1,000\u03a9m and a period of 1,000\ns.\nIn the next step, we tested different starting models between 25\u00a0\u2212\u00a0500\u03a9m in order to find a compromise between a low starting misfit (obtained for very low resistivities e.g. 25\u03a9m due to the influence of the stations close to the mofettes) and the computed average resistivities for each period (reaching from 250\u00a0\u2212\u00a02,000\u03a9m). A background resistivity of 300\u03a9m was selected as this value resulted in the best inversion result resolving many relevant structures and revealing the best data fit. As mentioned above, the vertical transfer functions seem to require a conductive structure in the north outside of the measurement area. Previous works therefore included crustal-scale anisotropic structures in their 2D models (Eisel and Haak, 1999). After several synthetic tests we found that two remote, but very conductive sedimentary basins need to be included into the starting model: (i) the North German Basin and (ii) the Thuringian Basin (see Fig. 5a). Both structures were finally implemented with 3\u03a9m as an integrated resistivity and following the general shape of these basins with an average depth of 4\nkm and 2\nkm, respectively.\nFurthermore, after testing we only allowed modifications of the resistivity structure made by the inversion in restricted areas. Best results were obtained by fixing the outermost padding cells allowing the inversion to change only an inner part of roughly 950\nkm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0950\nkm. The smoothing values \u03b1\n\nx\n, \u03b1\n\ny\n and \u03b1\n\nz\n were varied between 0.1\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.3. Best data fit was achieved by using a smoothing value of \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.1 for each direction.\nIn a next step, we tested several error settings and values for the different transfer functions. We varied the error values between 3\u00a0\u2212\u00a05% for the vertical transfer functions, between 5\u00a0\u2212\u00a010% for the off-diagonal and between 10\u00a0\u2212\u00a0100% for the main-diagonal impedance tensor components trying constant error values, fixed error values as well as error floors and different types of error calculation (e.g. percentage of |Z\n\nij\n|, \n\n\n\n\nZ\nij\n\n\u2217\n\nZ\nji\n\n\n\n\n or \n\n\n\n\nZ\nii\n\n\u2217\n\nZ\nij\n\n\n\n\n). Finally, we assigned a constant value of 0.05 for the vertical transfer functions and fixed error values to 5% of |Z\n\nij\n| for the off-diagonal and 20% of \n\n\n\n\nZ\nii\n\n\u2217\n\nZ\nij\n\n\n\n\n for the main-diagonal impedance tensor components. Moreover, we tested the sensitivity of the inversion results to sub-sets of data (e.g. only impedance or vertical transfer functions) as well as to different inversion strategies (e.g. joint inversion of impedance and vertical transfer functions and several cascaded inversions using the inversion result of one data type as a starting model for the other data sub-set or the combination of both data types).\n\n\n4.2\nPreferred model\nOur preferred model was finally obtained in two steps using a cascaded inversion scheme. First, we inverted only the vertical transfer functions using the 300\u03a9m background model including the two sedimentary basins as starting and prior model. The model fits the vertical transfer functions to a normalized root mean square (RMS) of 1.02 (starting from 2.73) after 9 iterations. In the second step, we used the inversion result of the first step as starting model for a joint inversion of impedance and vertical transfer functions. As prior model we used the starting model of the first step. The model fits the full data set to a normalized RMS of 1.8 (starting from 11.16) after 104 iterations. Fig. 6\n provides insights into the data fit for the different sub-sets, the data fit over period and compares measured and predicted data for three exemplary stations.\nThe misfit distribution (Fig. 6a) is rather homogeneously distributed, increasing only slightly from south to north probably due to the different data quality. In general, the best data fit is obtained for the off-diagonal impedance tensor components and for longer periods (T\u00a0>\u00a030\ns) of the vertical transfer functions. We present the preferred model in a series of map views (Fig. 7\n), cut out models and pseudo-sections (Figs. 8-9\n\n) as well as isosurfaces (Figs. 9b and 10\n) in order to give a spatial impression and to highlight the most important structures.\nThe overall resistivity of the largest part of the model is very high (R1, resistivities up to 57,000\u03a9m) as it can be expected for the old crystalline basement that dominates large parts of the study area (see e.g. Figs. 7c-f and 8). A significant difference for the three Variscan tectonic units cannot be observed. However, slightly increased resistivity values are resolved in the southern part of the study area in the Moldanubian unit (see e.g. Fig. 7c).\nFor the topmost layer we observe lower resistivities than the 300\u03a9m background resistivity for almost the entire study area (Fig. 7a) probably due to a sediment cover or as compensation of near-surface effects such as static shift or topography. Furthermore, a shallow conductive anomaly (C1) occurs in the north between the MLFZ and the A\u0161-Tachov fault (Figs. 7a-b, 8 and 9) with average resistivities of 20\u00a0\u2212\u00a0200\u03a9m down to a depth of 125\u00a0\u2212\u00a0250\nm. The outline of the conductor C1 (e.g. Figs. 9b and 10) corresponds well with the location of the sedimentary Cheb Basin. Extremely low resistivities down to 0.3\u03a9m are resolved close to the spas FL and Sibyllenbad (SB) and nearby the mofettes, although a direct assignment of these anomalies to the individual small-scale structures is not possible due to the comparatively coarse grid. Moreover, the northern part of C1 is characterized by slightly decreased resistivity values (in some parts <20\u03a9m) in contrast to the southern part with resistivity values greater than 30\u03a9m.\nThe most prominent structure of the model is a deep reaching conductive channel (C2) with an approximate resistivity of 120\u03a9m extending from the surface down to a depth of at least 28\nkm connecting C1 to a deeper conductive reservoir at a depth of 21\u00a0\u2212\u00a028\nkm (Fig. 10). The conductor C2 has an enhanced conductive part with resistivity values lower than 80\u03a9m starting at a depth of approximately 10\nkm (Figs. 8 and 9c). The lowest resistivities of the conductor C2 of 8\u00a0\u2212\u00a010\u03a9m are observed at a depth of 21\u00a0\u2212\u00a028\nkm forming a conductive reservoir (Figs. 8, 9a and c).\nCloser to the surface, the conductive channel branches into several sub-channels. However, the resolution is poor and not comparable with Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) due to the different sizes of the grids and their cells. The main branch connects the reservoir from the north with the conductor C1 close to the north of profile 1 (Figs. 8 and 9a). Furthermore, the conductor C2 shows a spatial proximity to the NK focal zone (Fig. 7c-f). The hypocentres of the swarm earthquakes cluster around the more conductive part of C2 (Fig. 10).\nTo the east of the study area, another deep reaching conductive feature can be observed (C3). This conductor is located east of the spa ML with its centre above the spa Konstantinovy L\u00e1zn\u011b (KL; Fig. 7c-f) approximately 20\nkm away from the easternmost stations. The resolution of the exact geometry and the actual resistivity is limited because large parts of this structure are not covered by the stations. Similar to the conductor C2, C3 has a more conductive part of 3\u00a0\u2212\u00a04\u03a9m in a depth range of 16\u00a0\u2212\u00a021\nkm forming a conductive reservoir (Figs. 8 and 9a). This reservoir is slightly shallower than the reservoir of C2, but has a greater expansion (Figs. 8 and 10). Closer to the surface, the conductor branches into three sub-channels (Figs. 7c and 10). The branch in the south shows low resistivity values between 2\u00a0\u2212\u00a05\nkm depth, but does not seem to reach the surface. Between 4\u00a0\u2212\u00a05\nkm depth, the middle branch splits again into two branches, one connecting to ML and another one south of ML (Figs. 9 and 10). The northern of these two branches shows lower resistivities close to the surface, which correlate with known degassing centres and springs (Figs. 7a and 8). The lowest resolution has the northern of the three main branches probably due the lack of station coverage. Furthermore, the conductors C2 and C3 seem to be connected at larger depths (>28\nkm); however, resolution studies indicate that, although explaining the data, this connection is not a robust feature and might also be an artefact generated by the inversion and the applied smoothing settings.\nIn the west, we observe another conductive area (C4) between the two faults Franconian and Luhe line (Fig. 7c-d) at a distance of 1.5\u00a0\u2212\u00a06\nkm to the westernmost stations. The outline of this conductor is visualized by an isosurface of 150\u03a9m in the Figs. 9b and 10, although the geometry of this conductor can only be resolved within some uncertainties as this structure is located outside the station grid. This area belongs to none of the three Variscan units, but instead is characterized by Permo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic units. Furthermore, the model resolves a conductive structure close to the sedimentary basins in the north outside the study area (not shown), especially beneath the Thuringian Basin. It is also noticeable that conductive structures are absent beneath the volcanic structures or close to the suture zones of the Variscan units or known faults as the A\u0161-Tachov fault.\n\n\n4.3\nSensitivity tests\nSeveral sensitivity tests were performed in order to determine which resistivity structures are required by the data. The depth resolution of the MT data was tested using a \u201csqueeze test\u201d. For this test, the resistivity below a certain depth was set to the prior value of 300\u03a9m and the impact of these constraints on the data fit was determined. We did six inversion runs with resistivity fixed below 36, 47, 60, 100, 134 and 175\nkm. Significant increases in the normalized starting misfit occur for the three shallowest depths in the squeeze test, although only some stations are affected for the 60\nkm depth. This demonstrates that at least in some areas, deeper structures are required by the data. For the shallowest depth of 36\nkm, the constrained inversion was no longer able to fit the data as well as for the normal unconstrained inversion. Therefore, we conclude that the MT data can resolve structures up to a depth between 36 and 47\nkm, with somewhat greater depths beneath some localized areas.\nNext, we tested several shallow small-scale conductive anomalies for example within the conductor C1 or close to ML. For this purpose, we substituted cells with extremely low resistivities (e.g. <3\u03a9m) by average resistivity values of the surrounding cells (e.g. 20\u03a9m) and calculated the forward response of these modified models as well as we started new inversions from these modified models. The forward models show an increased misfit close to stations, where changes were made. Moreover, the inversions tend to recover many of these small-scale conductive anomalies, especially within the conductor C1 and around ML. In summary, we conclude that these shallow small-scale conductive anomalies close to the spas and mofettes in the Cheb Basin and the surrounding of ML are required by the MT data.\nFurthermore, we tested the resolution of the two most striking conductors C2 and C3. This is of great importance, especially for C3, as large parts of this conductor are not covered by stations and thus the validity of certain parameters such as its exact geometry is limited. The vertical extend of these conductors were tested by replacing deeper parts (>2.5\nkm) of these conductive anomalies by the background resistivity of 300\u03a9m. Again, forward calculations and new inversions were started from the modified models. The forward models show that for the modified models the misfit at the neighbouring stations is considerably increased. Further, the inversions tend to recover the vertical conductor C2 as well as all three branches of conductor C3 and especially the southern branch of C3. In a next step, we substituted only the \u201creservoirs\u201d of C2 and C3 at a depth of 16.4\nkm by the background resistivity. The misfit of the forward calculation of this modified model was increased. An inversion started from this modified model recovers especially the reservoir beneath ML, and to some extent the smaller and more resistive reservoir of C2. Further tests on possible connection of the deepest parts of C2 and C3 reveal that the reservoirs could also be separated without resulting in an increased RMS. This suggests that the inversion and the recorded data have no sensitivity for the deepest parts of C2 and C3, however, this also means that a connection of both conductors at depth is not explicitly excluded.\nThe resolution of the conductor C4 was tested, as it is hardly covered by stations. Therefore, we substituted the lower resistivity values of C4 by the background resistivity. The misfit of this modified model is significantly increased, especially for the surrounding stations of profile 1 in the southwest. An inversion started from the modified model recovers large parts of the conductor C4, indicating that this conductor is needed by the data. Furthermore, the new inversion tends to recover the reservoirs of C2 and C3 with lower resistivity values, e.g. with down to 5\u00a0\u2212\u00a06\u03a9m for the most conductive parts of C2. If we fix the area of C4 to the background resistivity of 300\u03a9m, the inversion misfit increases, especially in the south and the inversion is not able to find an alternative model that explains the data as well as the unconstrained inversion.\nFinally, we tested the conductive structures close to the two sedimentary basins in the north outside the study area, which we implemented in our starting model. We excluded the basins from our preferred model and replaced them with the background resistivity. The forward calculation of this modified model has a larger misfit, especially for the vertical transfer functions. The subsequent inversion recovers conductive features in the north in the area of the Thuringian Basin, indicating that the vertical transfer functions require some conductive features in the north outside the study area, e.g. the two basins or some other conductor. Furthermore, the new inversion resolved the two reservoirs of C2 and C3 with lower resistivity values down to <4\u03a9m for C2 and down to <3\u03a9m for C3. The necessary existence of a conductive feature in the north was further supported by another test: We fixed the two basins in the preferred model to the background resistivity of 300\u03a9m and the subsequent newly started inversion was unable to fit the long periods of the vertical transfer functions.\n\n\n4.4\nDiscussion\nThe largest part of the preferred model is dominated by the extensive resistive body R1. Its upper boundary is located in the upper crust starting at approximately several hundreds of metres and continues down to the maximum resolution depth of 36\u00a0\u2212\u00a047\nkm. The high electrical resistivities up to 57,000\u03a9m can be associated with the crystalline basement and they match well with observed and modelled resistivity values of previous MT studies (e.g. Di Mauro et al., 1999; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2018; Mair, 2020, and references therein) as well as resistivity values for crystalline (igneous) rocks of the continental crust from literature (e.g. Haak and Hutton, 1986; Simpson and Bahr, 2005; Chave and Jones, 2012). Although a significant resistivity variation between the three tectonic units is not resolved, a noticeable decrease of resistivity is observed for the units of the Permo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic in the west (C4). From previous measurements in the framework of the KTB investigations it is known that these units show much lower resistivities than the crystalline basement of the Variscan units (see e.g. Eisel and Haak, 1999; Eisel et al., 2001; Storz et al., 2000).\nThe relatively low resistivities of the first layer for almost the entire study area can be associated with a sedimentary cover and\/or is a compensation of near-surface effects as e.g. static shift or topography, which were not explicitly addressed by the model and are therefore not further interpreted. The shallow conductor C1 is spatially correlated with the Cheb Basin and is restricted by the MLFZ in the east and the A\u0161-Tachov fault in the west. Its estimated depth of 125\u00a0\u2212\u00a0250\nm fits well with the known geology, which characterizes the Cheb Basin as a up to 300\nm thick basin filled with sediments of Tertiary and Quaternary age (Br\u00e4uer et al., 2003; Fischer et al., 2014). These unconsolidated sediments are responsible for the observed average low electrical resistivities of 20\u00a0\u2212\u00a0200\u03a9m. Further, these resistivity values match well with the observed and modelled values for the Cheb Basin from previous MT studies in the area by Di Mauro et al. (1999) and Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018). The shallow small-scale conductive anomalies within C1 with resistivities down to 0.3\u03a9m spatially correlate with the known spas FL in the western Cheb Basin and SB in the south. Furthermore, the locations of these small-scale conductive anomalies can be associated with the locations of several mofette fields as e.g. the Bubl\u00e1k and Hartou\u0161ov mofette fields or the Soos national nature reserve. Sensitivity tests indicate that these small-scale structures are required by the data. Furthermore, Mair (2020) also resolved low resistivities <1\u03a9m close to the mofettes. However, direct correlations of the small-scale anomalies with the individual degassing centres are beyond the scope of this paper and were not possible due to the grid size required for the regional perspective. However, a localized increase of the electrical conductivity correlated with the ascent of fluids would correspond with the findings of other small-scale electrical resistivities studies conducted in the vicinity of known degassing centres in this region (e.g. Flechsig et al., 2008; Nickschick et al., 2019; Rulff et al., 2021). Moreover, the slightly increased resistivities in the southern part of C1 can be spatially associated with the gas-free zone in the southern Cheb Basin described by Weinlich et al. (1998, 2013).\nOne of the most striking resistivity features in the model is the deep reaching conductive channel C2. We interpret this conductor as a fluid pathway from the lower crust to the surface similar to Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018). This conductor connects a potential fluid\/magma reservoir at the crust-mantle boundary with the degassing centres within the shallow conductor C1 (see Fig. 11\n). However, the split of C2 at shallower depths towards the individual degassing spots is only partly resolved by our model due to the limited grid resolution. In contrast to Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018), the conductor C2 is now located more to the west of profile 1, indicating that the northern conductive channel in their 2D model is a projection of the conductor C2 resolved in the 3D model. Similar to the 2D model of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018), the conductor C2 has a more conductive part at larger depths (>10\nkm) and reaches its lowest resistivity values of 8\u00a0\u2212\u00a010\u03a9m in a depth range of 21\u00a0\u2212\u00a028\nkm. In addition, shape, location, resistivities and the split of this conductor C2 close to the surface match well with those of the conductor resolved by the 3D inversion of the two regional profiles by Mair (2020). Following the explanations of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018, and references therein), the CO2\u2013H2O system in the faults change from a single phase system with dissociated ions to a two phase system with gas state CO2 bubbles at a depth of roughly 9.6\nkm in the study area. Therefore, the shallower parts of the conductor C2 can be associated with the more resistive two phase system of the ascending fluids, whereas the deeper and more conductive part of C2 is represented by the more conductive single phase system of these fluids. The most conductive part of C2 can be associated with one of the crust-mantle reservoirs postulated by Br\u00e4uer et al. (2008). The transition from the single phase system to the two phase system in the Cheb Basin is expected at a depth range of 6\u00a0\u2212\u00a011\nkm (Weinlich, 2014) and corresponds well with the depth of the hypocentres of the swarm earthquakes. Our 3D inversion model strongly suggest that the earthquakes are located in the resistive surrounding of conductor C2. These findings are confirmed by local scale 3D models of Mair (2020). A real MT experiment across the San Andreas Fault in California revealed a similar result. Becken et al. (2011) reported that brittle rock failure and earthquakes often occur close to the boundary of, or within, regions of high electrical resistivity, but adjacent to zones of low resistivity. They explain these observations at the San Andreas Fault through the migration of fluids from a permeable, mechanically weak source region into a less permeable, mechanically strong zone of high electrical resistivity. Similar observations were reported by e.g. Ogawa et al. (2001, 2014) for the Japanese back arc, Comeau et al. (2015) for a volcano in Bolivia or by Aizawa et al. (2021) for volcanoes in Japan. As the 2D model of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) is located east of the focal zone, they could only use projected locations of the earthquake hypocentres that likely resulted in their misleading interpretation that the earthquakes would be located within the conductive structure. A seismic study of Mousavi et al. (2015, 2017) reveals an anomalous crustal body located just below and north of the NK focal zone that is characterized by high vp values and high vp\/vs ratios. This anomaly spatially correlates with the shape of conductor C2. Mousavi et al. (2015) interpreted this anomaly as a solidified intrusive body which contributes to the triggering of earthquakes by delivering fluids into the focal zone. Furthermore, they assume that this mid-crustal intrusive body could be part of a fluid pathway from the mantle through the earthquake zone up to the mofette fields in the south at the surface. This would support our hypothesis that C2 is a fluid pathway from the lower crust to the surface and the associated degassing centres.\nTo the east of the study area, another deep reaching and prominent conductive structure (C3) is observed. Similar to C2, we interpret this conductor as a fluid pathway from the lower crust to the surface (see Fig. 11). The exact shape and extension of this conductor can be slightly different as resolved in the 3D model due to the sparse station coverage. However, its existence and its splits into several branches were confirmed by several sensitivity tests. The conductor C3 consists of a large reservoir at depth and several conductive branches that connect this reservoir to the surface. The reservoir is larger and more conductive than the reservoir associated with C2. Furthermore it is located at a slightly shallower depth, supporting the hypothesis of Br\u00e4uer et al. (2005, 2008) of small-scale spatially separated magmatic reservoirs. Based on different long-term behaviour and levels of the 3He\/4He ratio, they postulate that the degassing centres in the Cheb Basin and around ML are supplied by different small and isolated reservoirs at the crust-mantle boundary. In general, the depth ranges of the deep reservoirs of the conductors C2 and C3 fit reasonably well with other combined seismological, isotopic and mantle xenoliths studies, which describe a magma accumulation in a depth range of 25\u00a0\u2212\u00a035\nkm (Geissler et al., 2005; Heuer et al., 2006; Geissler et al., 2007). The southern branch of C3 correlates neither with a known fault, a volcanic structure nor with a degassing centre. This can possibly be explained by the fact that this branch does not reach the surface. The middle branch of C3 forks at a depth of 4\u00a0\u2212\u00a05\nkm. The northern part connects to the degassing centres around ML and shallow small-scale conductive anomalies spatially correlate with known mofettes. The northern branch of C3 has the lowest resolution possibly due to the sparse station coverage in the northern part. This conductor might represent a fluid pathway to the famous spa KV. However, due to the limited resolution in this part this remains speculative.\nFinally, it is noticeable that conductive structures are absent beneath the volcanic structures, close to the suture zones of the Variscan units or the A\u0161-Tachov fault along the stations of profile 2. Therefore, we conclude that the southern conductor observed in the 2D model of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) is very likely a projection of another conductive off-profile structure. Based on the spatial proximity, the middle branch of conductor C3 would be the most obvious explanation for the conductor observed in the previous 2D model. To examine this hypothesis, we compare the 3D model with newly conducted and the previous 2D inversion results in the next section.\n\n\n\n5\nComparison with 2D inversion results\nFor the 2D inversions of the three long profiles we used the finite element code MARE2DEM (Key and Ovall, 2011; Key, 2016). MARE2DEM uses a goal-oriented adaptive finite element method for the forward solutions that automatically generates and refines unstructured triangular element grids. We ran between 70\u00a0\u2212\u00a0200 inversions for each profile testing several inversion settings and parameters e.g. different grids, starting models, data errors or different input data (apparent resistivity and phases, logarithm of apparent resistivity and phase, vertical transfer functions and combinations of them). A presentation of these tests is beyond the scope of this paper; and moreover, they often resulted in similar inversion models demonstrating the robustness of the obtained models. For better comparison with the 2D result of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) (hereafter called EMERES15), we show only inversion results using rotated apparent resistivity and phase curves. Moreover, all 3D and 2D results are shown without smoothing.\nA simplified topography was included in all 2D inversion grids and the rotated data were projected onto profiles perpendicular to their respective strike angles. As starting models we used homogeneous half-spaces. For the three profiles, the subsurface was discretized with 26,000\u00a0\u2212\u00a033,000 cells. We forced the cell sizes of the finite element grid to mainly grow with depth by defining eight boxes centred around the stations with depths between 100\nm and 200\nkm below surface and increasing widths. The edge length within each box was kept constant growing from 100\nm for the shallowest box up to 7\nkm for the lowest box. For the EMERES15 profile the subsurface was coarser discretized with roughly 12,000 cells using three boxes up to a depth of 6\nkm. The trade-off Lagrange multiplier was set to 5 in all inversions and as weight between horizontal and vertical smoothness a factor of 3 was used. For the three profiles of the current field campaign we inverted 51 periods between 10\u22124\u00a0\u2212\u00a04,096\ns, while Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) could use only periods up to 362\ns. To reduce the influence of static shift, the apparent resistivities, in particular of the transverse electric (TE) mode, were down-weighted and a higher weight was given to phases by choosing small errors for them. The error for the apparent resistivity of the TE mode was set to 50% (profile 1 and 2) and 100% (profile 3 and EMERES15), meanwhile we used much smaller errors of 10% (profile 1 and 2) and 20% (profile 3 and EMERES15) for the apparent resistivities of the transverse magnetic (TM) mode. Constant errors of 2\u2218 (profile 1 and 2) and 3\u2218 (profile 3 and EMERES15) were used for the phases of both modes. The data used for the EMERES15 profile were furthermore shifted for some stations by a constant factor for each station and mode to correct for static shift. Other important parameters for the three profiles as well as for the EMERES15 profile are summarized in Table 1\n.\nBefore we discuss differences and similarities between 3D and 2D inversion results, we compare the 2D inversion result of profile 2 (Fig. 12b) with the EMERES15 model (Fig. 12e).\nProfile 2 uses data from the same stations as EMERES15 plus the data of 17 stations conducted in 2018. However, the data are rotated by different angles and as a result projected to slightly different profiles. Furthermore, the grid used for EMERES15 is noticeable coarser than the grid for profile 2. The conductor C1 in the centre of the EMERES15 profile associated with the Cheb Basin can also be observed for profile 2. Furthermore, two conductive channels C2 and C3 are resolved in both models. Even the split of C2 close to the surface in two branches can be observed in both cases. However, the vertical conductors C2 and C3 are much thinner in profile 2 very likely due to the finer grid. The conductor C3, which could only be resolved poorly for EMERES15 due to the lack of stations, forks into two branches in profile 2. Lower resistivities at larger depths are observed for C2 and C3, similar to EMERES15, although the depth and conductivities itself differ between the two models. In both models, the conductors C2 and C3 are separated by a large resistor R2 and another resistive feature R1 is resolved in the north. Solely the resistivity values of the resistors differ, probably because some of the data used for the EMERES15 profile were corrected for static shift and therefore shifted to lower resistivity values. Nevertheless, despite all the differences, the 2D models show many similarities. All important conductors and resistors interpreted by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) are resolved in the northern part of profile 2, which coincides with the EMERES15 profile.\nFor a comparison of the 2D results with the 3D result, we show sections through the preferred 3D model along the real locations of the corresponding stations (Fig. 12a and d) and adjusted the colour scale of the 3D model. The cut through the 3D model along profile 2 shows lower resistivities close to the surface in the northern part associated with the Cheb Basin and consistent with the 2D results. However, many of the other structures visible in the 2D models of profile 2 and EMERES15 as the vertical conductors C2 and C3 are absent in the section from the 3D model, instead a deeper conductor associated with the reservoir beneath the Cheb Basin is discernible. This supports the idea that the 2D results are affected by some 3D and\/or off-profile structures. Cruces-Zabala et al. (2020) systematically tested and assessed the influence of off-profile structures on 2D models obtained by MARE2DEM using real and synthetic data from Venezuela. They demonstrate that off-profile conductors can be mapped into 2D models as long as the station data are influenced by these structures. Furthermore, they show that the shape and inclination of conductors crossing the profiles, e.g. conductive faults, can differ from their true location and dip depending on the projection of the stations onto the profile. As we showed in the 3D section above, a vertical conductor in the north exists located west of profile 2. This conductor C2 in the 3D model is very likely projected into the 2D models and corresponds to the conductor C2 of these models. The vertical conductor C3 in the south of the 2D models is also not visible in the 3D model along profile 2 (Fig. 12a). A possible explanation for this conductor C3 in the 2D models, is a projection of another off-profile conductor, e.g. the conductor C3 of the 3D model close to ML, into the 2D model. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted synthetic 2D inversions. A forward calculation of the preferred 3D model using the real station layout was conducted to generate the data for this synthetic inversion. 5% Gaussian noise was added to the synthetic data consistent with the applied error for the 3D model for the off-diagonal impedance tensor components. Then, the synthetic data were rotated and projected in the same manner as the real data for the subsequent 2D inversions. For a better comparison, the same inversion settings, e.g. grid, starting model and error settings, as for the 2D inversions of the real data were used for the synthetic 2D inversions. Differences were made only for the EMERES15 profile as we did not correct the data for static shift. The results of the synthetic inversions for profile 2 and EMERES15 are shown in Fig. 12c and f. Interestingly, they show many similarities to the 2D inversion results of the real data (Fig. 12b and e). The shallow lower resistivities associated with the Cheb Basin are observed for both synthetic models. Furthermore, the conductive channel C2 in the north is visible in profile 2 as well as in the EMERES15 profile, supporting our statement that the conductor C2 from the 3D model located west of profile 2 is projected into the 2D models. Moreover, another conductive channel in the south is visible in both synthetic models. While the channel for the EMERES15 profile differs from its dip and location from C3 of the real data, larger similarities are observed for the real and synthetic inversion along profile 2. For the synthetic inversion of profile 2, two conductive features are observed in the south (Fig. 12c). One extends down to greater depths and could be associated with the northern branch of C3 observed for the real data inversion (Fig. 12b); the second more shallower conductive feature of the synthetic inversion could be at least partly associated with the southern branch of C3, especially for the more shallower part. This supports our hypothesis, that the southern conductive channel C3 in the 2D inversions of the real data for profile 2 and EMERES15 is also a projection of an off-profile conductor. Due to its spatial proximity and the shape of this conductor with a split into two branches closer to the surface, the conductive channel C3 close to ML resolved in the 3D model is the most probable explanation. This clearly demonstrates that the 2D inversion results are significantly affected by off-profile 3D structures.\n\nFig. 13\n shows a comparison of the 3D result along profile 1 and 3 with the corresponding 2D inversion results of the real data as well as 2D inversion results of synthetic data obtained from the preferred 3D model using the same procedure as described for profile 2.\nShallow, lower resistivities are visible in the northern part of the profile section of the 3D model along profile 1 (Fig. 13a). These resistivities are associated with the sediments of the Cheb Basin and the known degassing centres. Furthermore, parts of the conductor C2, especially its reservoir appears at the northern end of the profile section. In the centre of this 3D excerpt, the resistor R1 is resolved and other small-scale conductors are shown in the middle and southern part of the model belonging to the conductor C4. All these structures are also resolved in the corresponding 2D inversion of the real data (Fig. 13b), although the 2D model appears more complex and the depth, location and inclination of some structures, e.g. the vertical channel of C2, differ from the 3D model. Following the 3D model, the conductor C2 is located north of the stations of profile 1. A possible explanation for its southern inclination in the 2D model is the projection of the stations onto the profile, similar to the observations made by Cruces-Zabala et al. (2020) for their data set. Unfortunately, the conductor C2 is poorly resolved in the 2D model of the synthetic data calculated from the 3D preferred model (Fig. 13c), although a slightly southern inclination is indicated. Nonetheless, this synthetic model shows many similarities with the 2D model of the real data. Especially the conductive anomalies in the south and the shallow, lower resistivities in the northern part can be resolved.\nThe profile section of the 3D model along profile 3 (Fig. 13d) is dominated by high resistivities of the resistor R1 and some structures with lower resistivities associated with the reservoir and different branches of the conductor C3. However, most parts of the conductor C3 are located east of the profile and consequently do not appear in this profile section. The 2D model of the real data (Fig. 13e) shows several conductive structures within a resistive background. The most striking structure is a conductor extending from the centre of the profile up to the north in a depth range of 20\u00a0\u2212\u00a030\nkm. Due to its position and depth, this conductor is very likely a projection of the reservoir anomaly C3 resolved in the 3D inversion east of profile 3. Some of the vertical and sub-vertical conductive structures shown in the 2D model can be associated with the different branches of C3, although their inclination and shape differs from the 3D model probably due to their projection. Furthermore, lower resistivities are observed at shallow depths close to ML similar to the 3D model. The 2D inversion result of the synthetic data calculated from the preferred 3D model is shown in Fig. 13f. It also includes a conductive reservoir starting at a depth of 20\nkm with similar resistivities as observed in the 2D model of the real data. In both cases, the resolved resistivities are much lower than the resistivities observed for this structure in the 3D model. Two conductive branches fork below ML, one dipping to the north and one to the south. They represent very likely the middle branch of C3, that splits close to the surface. Due to the poor data quality of the real data in the vicinity of ML, the appearance and resolution of the different branches of C3 differ in the real and synthetic 2D inversions. However, both 2D models show clearly that 3D features east of the profile considerably influence the 2D inversions.\nIn general, all 2D inversions of the real and synthetic data showed that the 2D models are significantly affected by 3D and off-profile structures. Some of them are projected into the 2D models. Therefore, a 3D inversion was essential for this data set to determine the true location, shape and conductivities of these structures. Although profile 2 and the previously conducted EMERES15 profile contain the most important anomalies, they were to some extent wrongly positioned leading to incorrect interpretations. For one thing, the conductor C2 is located more to the west. The hypocentres of the swarm earthquakes therefore do not correspond with lower resistivities within this conductor. Instead the hypocentres of the earthquakes cluster around this conductor C2 and are located at the resistive flanks. Furthermore, the conductor C3 in the 2D models of profile 2 and the EMERES15 profile can neither be associated with the A\u0161-Tachov fault, nor with a suture zone or a conductive feature originating from the Quaternary volcanic structures. Instead, this conductor is very likely a projection of a prominent conductive feature east of the study area that forms a large reservoir at depth and has several ascending channels to the surface feeding for instance the degassing centres around ML.\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nMany of the previous magnetotelluric (MT) field surveys in the study and surrounding area have acquired data either along a few profiles or on small local grids allowing only 2D modelling and rather spatially limited 3D modelling studies. The newly conducted MT data were aligned along three 50\u00a0\u2212\u00a075\nkm long profiles which extend to previous MT stations measured by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) in the north. Furthermore, additional stations were acquired between the profiles covering the region of the Quaternary volcanic structures, the A\u0161-Tachov fault and the suture zones of the different tectonic units. Finally, the entire data set consisted of the newly acquired stations, reprocessed stations from the field campaigns in 2015 and 2016 (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2018) as well as some stations conducted in the framework of the German Continental Deep Drilling site KTB. These data were utilised to obtain the first comprehensive 3D model of the study area's subsurface electrical resistivity structure. In addition, it allows to determine structures that could not be unambiguous interpreted in previous studies due to either the lack or an unfavourable distribution of stations. Directionality analyses along the individual profile lines show that the geo-electrical strike direction for most of the stations is dominated by the Oh\u0159e Rift confirming the findings of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018). Nonetheless, a dimensionality analysis based on beta values of the phase tensors clearly demonstrates that the MT data inherit a strong 3D character especially for longer periods and in some areas for instance close to the mofettes. This indicates that a 2D analysis can resolve the expected complex 3D geo-electrical structure of the subsurface only within certain limits, and underline the necessity of a 3D modelling study.\nFor the 3D analysis we use the parallelized Modular Electromagnetic Inversion system ModEM (Meqbel, 2009; Egbert and Kelbert, 2012; Kelbert et al., 2014). We conduct several hundreds of inversions testing different parameter settings and strategies. Finally, we use a cascaded inversion to fit the impedance as well as vertical transfer functions. Large parts of the 3D model are dominated by high resistivity values up to 57,000\u03a9m representing the crystalline basement of the Variscan tectonic units. Lower resistivities are observed in the west for the units of the Permo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic. Previous measurements in the framework of the German Continental Deep Drilling site already showed that these units have much lower resistivities than the crystalline basement of the Variscan units (Eisel and Haak, 1999; Eisel et al., 2001; Storz et al., 2000). The sedimentary Cheb Basin in the north is resolved down to a depth of approximately 250\nm and is characterized by much lower resistivity values. For the near surface, even lower resistivities are observed within the Cheb Basin close to known degassing centres as mofettes or spas. The model reveals a conductive channel beneath the Cheb Basin that extends from the near surface down to the crust-mantle depth forming a conductive reservoir in a depth range of 21\u00a0\u2212\u00a028\nkm. This conductive structure resembles the northern conductive channel observed by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018). Furthermore, this conductive structure correlates spatially with the hypocentres of the swarm earthquakes which occurred in the Nov\u00fd Kostel focal zone between 2000 and 2010. The 3D model also clearly reveals that the hypocentres cluster within the resistive host rock around this conductive structure, comparable to what Becken et al. (2011) observed for the San Andreas Fault. Therefore, our 3D models update and thus contradict the 2D models by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) in which these hypocentres were located within the conducting deep reaching anomaly. As their profile was located east of the focal zone, they could only use projected locations at that time resulting in this misleading interpretation. Nonetheless, the conductive channel could represent a fluid pathway from the resolved reservoir in the lower crust to the surface feeding e.g. the Bubl\u00e1k and Hartou\u0161ov mofette fields, the springs and mofettes within the Soos national nature reserve as well as the spas Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b and Sibyllenbad. Furthermore, the location of this conductive structure coincides with a vp\/vs anomaly revealed in a seismic tomography study by Mousavi et al. (2015, 2017) that was interpreted by the authors as a mid-crustal solidified igneous body that could be part of a fluid pathway from the mantle up to the surface. Another conductive channel east of the study area is observed in the 3D model. Similar to the conductor in the north, it extends from the surface down to the crust-mantle boundary forming a conductive reservoir at depths of 16\u00a0\u2212\u00a021\nkm depth. Closer to the surface, this conductor forks into several branches. One of them connects to the spa Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b. This conductive feature could be interpreted as another small-scale reservoir at crust-mantle depth and a possible fluid pathway to the surface feeding several degassing spots in the east in the surrounding of Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b. Sensitivity studies confirmed that both conductors can be separated at larger depths supporting the hypothesis of Br\u00e4uer et al. (2005, 2008) that the mineral springs at the spas Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b and Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b are supplied by different small-scale spatially separated magmatic reservoirs. However, in the 3D model we could not resolve conductive structures beneath the Quaternary volcanic structures or close to the suture zones of the Variscan units or the A\u0161-Tachov fault along the profile of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018). This led us to the conclusion that the southern conductor observed in their 2D model has to be very likely a projection of another conductive off-profile structure. Based on the spatial proximity, the conductor east of the study area would be the most obvious explanation for the conductor observed in the previous 2D models. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the 3D model with newly conducted and the previous 2D inversion results as well as conducted synthetic 2D inversions using forward calculated data from the preferred 3D model. A 2D inversion of profile 2 containing both newly conducted stations and the stations used by Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) resolved all interpreted conductive features in their model. Furthermore, the synthetic modelling studies reinforced our hypothesis. Both vertical conductors in the models of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2018) are projections of off-profile conductive structures. The northern conductor is located more to the west in the 3D model and the southern conductor in their model is very likely a projection of parts of the conductor east of the current study area. In general, all 2D inversions of the real and synthetic data show that the 2D models are significantly affected by 3D and off-profile structures and confirmed the necessity of the conducted 3D study.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAnna Platz: Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Data curation.

The distribution and volumes of breakup-related volcanic products vary considerably along the margins of this region, with first-order variations appearing to be controlled by major faults (Skaarup et al., 2006). Following initial continental rifting, beginning in the Early Cretaceous or possibly earlier (Larsen et al., 2009), the Labrador Sea-Baffin Bay spreading system is thought to have evolved in three stages \u2013 Palaeocene, Eocene, and Oligocene to present \u2013 including major changes in extension direction (Oakey and Chalmers, 2012). The Labrador Sea-Baffin Bay oceanic basins and rifted margins are heavily segmented both structurally and in terms of igneous products (Skaarup et al., 2006\nAbdelmalak et al., 2019; Schiffer et al., 2020; Heron et al., 2019) not least by the Davis Strait, which has acted as a transform between the offset Baffin Bay and Labrador Sea basins and hosts the Davis Strait Igneous Province (DSIP). The DSIP formed largely coeval to continental breakup in the region (Abdelmalak et al., 2019; Clarke and Beutel, 2020). This structural and magmatic segmentation is to a larger degree controlled by pre-existing structures (Peace et al., 2018a; Peace et al., 2018b; Heron et al., 2019; Schiffer et al., 2020), but the dominant mechanism driving continental breakup in the region is debated. This debate specifically focuses on whether a plume played a major role, or whether a plume is even required to explain breakup, magmatism and structural evolution (Dam et al., 1998; Graham et al., 1998; Peace et al., 2017; Clarke and Beutel, 2020; Foulger et al., 2020; Peace et al., 2020).\nWhile the Northwest Atlantic is well covered by marine deep crustal seismic transects (see references in Fig. 3), seismic constraints onshore are more limited and only available from permanent or temporary seismic stations for earthquake observations and few active source seismic lines (Fig. 3). As a result, onshore-offshore relationships are therefore either poorly or not constrained. Regional crustal models onshore rely on potential field inversion (Welford and Hall, 2013; Welford et al., 2018; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2019), tomographic methods with rather low resolution (e.g. Darbyshire, 2005; Darbyshire et al., 2017; Pourpoint et al., 2018) and only few reference points from previously published station-wise crustal models from receiver function inversion (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003; Darbyshire, 2003; Kumar et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2010; Postlethwaite et al., 2014; Dahl-Jensen et al., 2016; Vervaet & Darbyshire, 2022; Gilligan et al., 2016). This is made worse by the extensive ice cover across Greenland, meaning that much of the complex onshore geology remains unmapped (Jess et al., 2020). Information on the crustal structure is essential to constrain the geodynamic evolution of rifting, lithosphere thinning and magmatism, in addition to linking key structures and magmatic volumes from the offshore to the onshore. In particular, high-velocity lower crust (HVLC) in combination with crustal thickness are important constraints for deciphering past geodynamic processes. Moreover, the interpretation of HVLC bodies based on geophysical data is extremely challenging and non-unique, which requires a careful integration with the regional geology.\nIn this contribution, we present new crustal models from receiver function (RF) inversion using the available passive seismological data in the Northwest Atlantic, including data from many previously unused stations. In particular, our study focuses on the crustal thickness, the nature of the crust-mantle transition, and the presence and thickness of HVLC in the region. These new results are compared to existing regional crustal thickness models (Laske et al., 2013; Welford and Hall, 2013; Welford et al., 2018; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2019) and allow us to update regional models and identify different continental blocks and terranes. Evidence for HVLC will add important onshore information, whilst interpretations of its origin will provide new insight into areas affected by magmatism and structural inheritance to improve our understanding of the Northwest Atlantic rift system and the DSIP. This information will provide new key constraints for geodynamic models of the region (Ady and Whittaker, 2018; Peace, 2021) and, more generally, for models of analogous geological settings elsewhere. Moreover, we will test the hypothesis that plate tectonics, in contrast to dominantly plume processes, have contributed to the formation of the Davis Strait and that part of the HVLC beneath Davis Strait may be related to deformation of a pre-existing metamorphosed crustal keel or metasomatised mantle.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nPrecambrian\nThe landmasses surrounding the Northwest Atlantic represent an assemblage of Archean cratons and Proterozoic orogens (St-Onge et al., 2009) which are known to have exerted substantial influence on the subsequent Mesozoic-Cenozoic evolution through the process of structural inheritance (Peace et al., 2018b; Heron et al., 2019; Schiffer et al., 2020). The correlation of Precambrian basement units and tectonic structures across Baffin Bay, Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea has been the focus of previous work (e.g. Kerr et al., 1996; Kerr et al., 1997; Wardle et al., 2002; St-Onge et al., 2009). Nonetheless, substantial unknowns exist, partially due the Greenland Ice Sheet preventing exposure (Jess et al., 2020), but also the Mesozoic-Cenozoic rifting and breakup (Abdelmalak et al., 2019).\nThe Archean cratons within the Northwest Atlantic are (Fig. 1): the Rae Craton, the Superior Craton and the North Atlantic-Nain Cratons (St-Onge et al., 2009). These cratons are connected by the spatiotemporally and structurally complex Proterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogen (Whitmeyer and Karlstrom, 2007), which comprises reworked Archean crust and juvenile volcanic belts (Whitmeyer and Karlstrom, 2007). The North Atlantic Craton in Greenland is bordered to the north and west by Palaeoproterozoic orogenic belts that are tectonically related to the Trans-Hudson Orogen including the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen (Van Gool et al., 2002; Engstr\u00f6m and Klint, 2014; Kolb, 2014), the Rinkian fold belt on the north side (Grocott and McCaffrey, 2017) and the Torngat Orogen on the west side of the craton (Fig. 1) (Scott, 1998). The Nagssugtoqidian Orogen is thought to correlate across Central Greenland, though ice coverage has made this hard to confirm (St-Onge et al., 2009). The Rinkian fold-belt is located on the Baffin Bay margin of West Greenland, but the exact structural relationships and its extent are not completely understood as it is predominantly ice-covered (Fig. 1) (Grocott and McCaffrey, 2017). The Torngat Orogen represents the collision between Nain (part of the North Atlantic craton) and the Core Zone, an assembly of various reworked Archean terranes (Wardle et al., 2002; St-Onge et al., 2009; Corrigan et al., 2021).\nFurther south, the Palaeoproterozoic Makkovik-Ketilidian Mobile Belt forms the southernmost province north of the Grenville front in Labrador and the southernmost tip of Greenland (Kerr et al., 1996; Garde et al., 2002; McCaffrey et al., 2004; LaFlamme et al., 2013; Dickin, 2021; Hinchey, 2021), while in the northern extreme of the region the Paleoproterozoic Inglefield Mobile Belt is located across North Greenland and Ellesmere Island (St-Onge et al., 2009).\n\n\n2.2\nFormation of the Northwest Atlantic and the davis strait igneous province\nThe Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay (Fig. 2\n) formed as a response to the divergence of Greenland and North America. According to Oakey and Chalmers (2012), after early phases of continental rifting (possibly since the Triassic (Larsen et al., 2009), separation occurred in three stages: 1) Separation between North America and Greenland in the Palaeocene, while the latter was still attached to Eurasia; 2) separation between Greenland and North America as well as between Eurasia and Greenland in the Eocene, during which Greenland moved as an independent plate; 3) continued separation between Eurasia and Greenland, which again was attached to North America, since the Oligocene. These main phases of extension resulted in seafloor spreading in the Labrador Sea (Chalmers and Laursen, 1995), and most likely also in Baffin Bay (Suckro et al., 2012). Structural inheritance is inferred to have controlled the compartmentalisation of the Northwest Atlantic highlighting the interaction of pre-existing structures and fabric with oblique rifting (Peace et al., 2018a; Peace et al., 2018b; Heron et al., 2019; Schiffer et al., 2020).\nThe Davis Strait, where many of the HVLC (high velocity lower crustal) bodies are concentrated, is a bathymetric high linking the Labrador Sea to Baffin Bay that is underlain by crust up to 20\u00a0km thick (Funck et al., 2007). The Davis Strait is thought to consist of continental lithosphere (Dalhoff et al., 2006) and hybrid\/transitional crust, heavily intruded, as well as patches of exhumed mantle, likely accommodated by the \u201cleaky\u201d Ungava Transform Fault System (Funck et al., 2007; Suckro et al., 2013). Furthermore, the Davis Strait appears to be the centre of Mesozoic-Cenozoic magmatism in the Northwest Atlantic (Funck et al., 2007; Funck et al., 2012; Hosseinpour et al., 2013; Suckro et al., 2013; Abdelmalak et al., 2019). The Davis Strait underwent dextral transtension, but not breakup during the first stage of Labrador Sea-Baffin Bay formation (Wilson et al., 2006; Suckro et al., 2013), followed by further transpression during the second stage (Geoffroy et al., 2001; Suckro et al., 2013).\nThe earliest magmatism that may be related to extensional processes in the Labrador Sea is Late Triassic in age (ca. 220\u00a0Ma; Larsen et al., 2009). However, more significant extensional stresses probably occurred later in the Early Cretaceous, exemplified by coast-parallel dykes in West Greenland (ca. 150\u00a0Ma; Larsen et al., 2009), debated equivalents in Labrador (Tappe et al., 2007; Peace et al., 2016), and Mesozoic diatremes (King and McMillan, 1975; Wilton et al., 2002; Wilton et al., 2016).\nThe majority of the volcanism in the Northwest Atlantic occurred between ~62 and\u00a0~\u00a058\u00a0Ma, coincident with an increased spreading rate in the Labrador Sea, and subsequently decreased volcanism after a major change in the spreading direction during the Eocene (~56\u00a0Ma), that resulted in a northward drift of Greenland (Oakey and Chalmers, 2012; Abdelmalak et al., 2019) and the Eurekan Orogeny (Heron et al., 2015; Piepjohn et al., 2016; Stephenson et al., 2017). Breakup occurred in the Palaeocene (Chalmers et al., 1995), approximately coeval with the eruption of flood basalt around the Davis Strait (Larsen et al., 2016).\nThe cause of extension, magmatism, structural complexity and final breakup is debated (e.g. Peace et al., 2017). One proposed model includes a mantle plume (Storey et al., 1998; Courtillot et al., 1999; Nielsen et al., 2002; Funck et al., 2007; Gerlings et al., 2009), while others stress the importance of structural inheritance and plate tectonic processes (Peace et al., 2017; Heron et al., 2019; Clarke and Beutel, 2020; Schiffer et al., 2020). Although geochemical modelling suggests some lavas in the Northwest Atlantic region do require moderately elevated temperatures (up to 1500\u00a0\u00b0C) with regard to ambient mantle temperatures (~1350\u00a0\u00b0C), deciphering the exact causes of producing these large volumes of lavas is debated (Hole, 2015; Hole and Natland, 2020). The detailed mapping of HVLC and crustal thickness will improve our understanding of the causes and rates of rifting and magmatism in the region.\n\n\n2.3\nLithospheric structure of the Northwest Atlantic region\nLithospheric structure is vital for unravelling the region's tectonic and magmatic evolution and to reveal the causative mechanisms of rifting, structural segmentation and magmatism. The Northwest Atlantic region has been the subject of various crustal-scale geophysical studies. However, these are primarily located offshore, while detailed information onshore is limited, which led to an unbalanced reporting of detailed crustal structure, for instance the presence of HVLC (see for example Welford and Hall, 2013; Welford et al., 2018 for data overviews).\nInformation on the lithospheric structure is available from several regional datasets, as well as deep crustal seismic profiles in the Northwest Atlantic region, which we have assembled into maps that illustrate the state of knowledge prior to our study (Fig. 3\n). The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (Fig. 3a) was presented by Schiffer et al. (2018), which used a seismic tomography model of the Arctic region (Lebedev et al., 2018) showing thick lithosphere of up to 240\u00a0km beneath Canada, and up to ~200\u00a0km beneath Greenland. The Labrador Sea lithosphere is as thin as 75\u2013120\u00a0km, consistent with oceanic lithosphere, while Baffin Bay has a lithospheric thickness of approximately 110\u2013120\u00a0km and Davis Strait has the thickest lithosphere (~120\u00a0km) in marine areas, although the difference between the latter two is perhaps near resolution limit. Moreover, direct information on the crustal structure is available from a number of crustal-scale seismic refraction and reflection lines mostly in marine areas and some onshore-offshore profiles (see Fig. 3 for list), as well as information from passive source seismology from RFs (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003; Darbyshire, 2003; Kumar et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2010; Postlethwaite et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2015; Vervaet & Darbyshire, 2022; Gilligan et al., 2016) and surface wave tomography (Darbyshire, 2005; Darbyshire et al., 2017; Mordret, 2018; Pourpoint et al., 2018). Information on the crustal structure is taken from Welford and Hall (2013) and Welford et al. (2018) for the offshore areas in Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea, respectively. Their models are based on gravity inversion with prior information from available seismic data (see Fig. 3 for full list). The circum-Arctic crustal model ArcCrust by Lebedeva-Ivanova et al. (2019) gives state-of-the-art information on the crust at latitudes greater than 67\u00b0N. For all other areas, we describe the crustal structure based on CRUST1.0 (Laske et al., 2013).\nThe Moho depth map based on the sources mentioned above (Fig. 3a) shows generally similar trends as the LAB depth model, with thick crust and lithosphere in the cratonic areas and orogenic\/mobile belts and thin crust and lithosphere, as expected, in the marine areas. The Labrador Sea has the thinnest crust of ~8\u201315\u00a0km, consistent with a developed ocean basin. Baffin Bay has thicker crust of typically 12\u201317\u00a0km, with local shallow Moho anomalies, while the Davis Strait has the deepest Moho in the range of 17\u201325\u00a0km. Subtracting the sedimentary layers, the crystalline crust (Fig. 3b) in the area shows obvious similarities with the Moho depth and differs mostly in the marine areas, due to water depth and typically thicker sedimentary successions than on land. The distribution of sediments between the passive margins is highly asymmetric, with the deepest basins along the eastern Baffin Bay margin in the north and the western Labrador Sea margin in the south (Peace et al. (2016). The crystalline crustal thickness in the Davis Strait appears to be more complex than the Moho depth, with a N-S oriented convex shaped sliver of thick crust (18\u201322\u00a0km), separated from Baffin Island and West Greenland by two \u201ccorridors\u201d of thinner crust. The crustal thickness, structure and velocities observed in the Davis Strait strongly indicate the presence of continental crust and a complex rift development across Davis Strait.\n\n\n2.4\nHigh velocity lower crust (HVLC)\nHigh velocity lower crust (here defined as crustal layers with Vp\u00a0=\u00a0~7.1\u20137.6\u00a0km\/s or Vs\u00a0=\u00a0~4.0\u20134.3\u00a0km\/s) has been documented across the Northwest Atlantic (summary by Hosseinpour et al., 2013). Knowledge about the type of HVLC is an important constraint for regional geodynamic interpretations, because HVLC can be used as a marker of past geodynamic processes such as igneous activity, mantle serpentinisation, orogenic events, and mode of crustal formation.\nHowever, unequivocal interpretation of the origin of HVLC is challenging, with much of the ambiguity focused around its composition, formation mechanism and when it was formed (e.g. pre-, syn- or post-rift) (Gernigon et al., 2004; Schiffer et al., 2016a; Abdelmalak et al., 2017; Schulte-Pelkum et al., 2017). While HVLC may exhibit uniform geophysical properties (Vs, Vp, density), its origin and composition can be varied (e.g. Gernigon et al., 2004; Schiffer et al., 2016a; Schulte-Pelkum et al., 2017), including syn-rift intruded lower crust (e.g. Thybo and Artemieva, 2013) and exhumed serpentinised mantle (e.g. P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic and Manatschal, 2009), as well as pre-existing igneous, metamorphic and metasomatised lithologies from previous rifting or orogenic events (e.g. Petersen and Schiffer, 2016). Although hydrated, intruded or otherwise modified peridotite obviously does not actually represent a \u201clower crustal\u201d lithology, we will include these anomalous bodies at the crust-mantle transition zone in the broad expression \u201chigh velocity lower crustal bodies\u201d.\nSeveral occurrences of HVLC have been observed in Palaeoproterozoic and\/or Archean crust (Schmidt, 2000; Kukkonen et al., 2008; England and Ebbing, 2012; Schulte-Pelkum et al., 2017). In Scandinavia several models have been suggested for this \u201ccratonic HVLC\u201d, including the presence of eclogite and lower crustal intrusions\/melt residues, but regardless of the mechanism, HVLC must have been emplaced in the Precambrian (Schmidt, 2000; Kukkonen et al., 2008; England and Ebbing, 2012). Schulte-Pelkum et al. (2017) investigated the distribution of HVLC across the continental US based on refraction, RF, tomography and xenolith data. Their results suggest that in some cases HVLC may be specifically related to cratonic crustal domains, as the thickest occurrences were observed in Proterozoic crust from the central and eastern US, while HVLC was not present in other cratonic areas. Also, according to the authors, the formation and destruction of HVLC could have happened at any time since its emplacement and through several distinct events. Areas of younger tectonic age exhibit only thin HVLC, which has led to the suggestion that HVLC formation may relate to periods when conditions are favourable for garnet growth. Although cratonic-type HVLC has been observed under many continents, important questions remain regarding its formation mechanism and how widespread it is globally.\nThe available regional crustal models from the Northwest Atlantic (Welford and Hall, 2013; Welford et al., 2018; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2019) do not describe an additional layer for HVLC, but HVLC has been mapped in the Northwest Atlantic by deep seismic studies (see Fig. 3 for references). Hence, we extract information on the presence and thickness of HVLC directly from the original publications, typically from refraction seismic lines (i.e., by identifying lower-crustal layers with Vp\u00a0=\u00a07.1\u20137.6\u00a0km\/s, Fig. 3b). We find that HVLC is abundant along the Labrador Sea margins (Chian et al., 1995b; Chalmers, 1997; Chian et al., 1998; Keen et al., 2018), reaching thicknesses of 6\u00a0km, but usually in the range of 2\u20134\u00a0km. Here, these lower crustal bodies are typically interpreted as syn-rift exhumed and serpentinised mantle. However, on the northernmost West Greenland Labrador Sea margin, close to the Davis Strait, newer seismic data suggests that these structures belong to a larger system of HVLC that is likely of igneous nature (Funck et al., 2007; Gerlings et al., 2009). Also, several of these HVLC bodies are within the spatial confines of the Davis Strait Igneous Province (DSIP) (Fig. 2 and 3) or in very close vicinity, which makes an igneous nature likely, as interpreted by Hosseinpour et al. (2013). Therefore, the HVLC along the Labrador Sea margins requires a thorough and targeted investigation with full reconsideration of a possible magmatic origin. The Davis Strait shows evidence for HVLC of up to 8\u00a0km thickness over a length of 300\u00a0km along the bathymetric high (Funck et al., 2007; Gerlings et al., 2009). The northern extent cannot be established based on the available seismic data, but to the south the HVLC appears to terminate when entering the oceanic domain (Gerlings et al., 2009). It is likely that this igneous HVLC extends further north to the northern limit of the Davis Strait, where Suckro et al. (2013) found HVLC of up to 5\u20136\u00a0km thick and 175\u00a0km wide. HVLC up to 8\u00a0km thick has been found offshore Disko Island, while the eastern (landward) limit of this HVLC body was out of range (Funck et al., 2012). In northern Baffin Bay, there is minimal evidence for HVLC. Specifically, Harrison et al. (2011) document HVLC at one location in Lancaster Sound, and Altenbernd et al. (2014) inferred a small HVLC body from a refraction seismic line south of the Thule airbase in Northwest Greenland. However, all other seismic lines in this area do not show evidence for HVLC (see comparison between Fig. 3a and b). Information on the presence of HVLC is limited to the deep seismic lines, while one can only infer the spatial extent between these, and no or only little information is available in the onshore areas.\n\nFunck et al. (2000b) report a thick HVLC keel in the northern Torngat Orogen, northern Labrador. This same structure was previously imaged by Funck and Louden (1999), who interpreted the high velocity crustal keel to have formed during the collision of the North Atlantic Craton with the Core Zone as part of the Trans-Hudson Orogeny. These seismic studies also suggest that the Palaeoproterozoic crust to the west of the Torngat Orogen has a HVLC layer. Louden and Fan (1998) and Funck et al. (2001) reported thick HVLC of up to 20\u00a0km in the northeastern Grenville Province (the southernmost limit of our study area) and related these to a magmatic body originating from late Precambrian Iapetan rifting, underthrusted beneath Precambrian crust and possible additional metamorphosed lower crust.\nThe HVLC imaged in the offshore domain of the Northwest Atlantic by previous studies has mostly been interpreted as mafic lower crustal intrusions, predominantly in the Davis Strait area, or syn-rift exhumed and serpentinised mantle along the Labrador Sea margins. Hosseinpour et al. (2013) published an interpretation of the extent of HVLC related to Palaeogene magmatism and included some of the Labrador Sea seismic profiles that were previously considered representing exhumed mantle (Chian and Louden, 1994; Chian et al., 1995b; Chalmers, 1997).\nInterpretation of geophysical data is generally non-unique, and this is especially the case for HVLC bodies, which frequently show similar seismic properties and densities irrespective of origin. Nonetheless, determining the origin of HVLC is of utmost concern in understanding the geologic evolution of such regions. Usually, only through interpretation of complementary high-resolution geophysical datasets (e.g. reflection, Vp and Vs refraction, gravity, magnetics) and good controls on structure, evolution, HVLC morphology and a combination of geophysical properties, can HVLC be interpreted with more certainty. In the case of the Northwest Atlantic, the seismic data are of various age, quality and type, usually with little complementary information, which often results in uncertainty and ambiguity in interpretation of the HVLC. The point-wise one-dimensional crustal models from RF inversion have the additional problem that these cannot be brought into a two- or three-dimensional structural context.\nThe existing models, as well as the sparse and uneven distribution of data, illustrate the need for additional constraints to make stronger inferences about the structural and magmatic evolution of the region. Our interpretations are limited to regional correlation with Moho depth estimates, known structures and lineaments, as well as the distribution of volcanics in the region. The DSIP is the central element in the Northwest Atlantic that we base most of our inferences of igneous-type HVLC on. Additionally, there is evidence for Cretaceous magmatism along the Labrador Sea margins (Tappe et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 2009; Peace et al., 2016). The region is also crossed by numerous terrane boundaries and sutures (St-Onge et al., 2009), many of which have been reactivated during breakup of the Northwest Atlantic (Schiffer et al., 2020, Peace et al., 2018a, 2018b). The Davis Strait is underlain by continental crust and lithosphere (Fig. 3) and has likely formed in response to rift interaction with pre-existing lithospheric scale structures (Peace et al., 2018a; Heron et al., 2019). We know from numerical models that pre-existing structure and thermal regime can lead to lower crustal flow, deformation of pre-existing metamorphic complexes and magmatic budget (Petersen and Schiffer, 2016; Petersen et al., 2018). For example, recent models propose the Greenland-Iceland-Faroes Ridge to be formed by reactivation of pre-existing structures and flow of thickened and soft continental lower crust to form a continual ridge crossing the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, possibly due to interaction of propagating rifts and different pre-existing orogenic fabric (Schiffer et al., 2015b; Petersen et al., 2018; Foulger et al., 2020; Schiffer et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n3\nReceiver function modelling\nRF analysis is a well-established seismological technique to investigate crustal and upper mantle discontinuities, as well as seismic properties of the subsurface (e.g. Ammon et al., 1990; Cassidy and Ellis, 1993; Kind et al., 1995; Owens et al., 1987; Sandvol et al., 1998). The RF method provides estimates of the Earth's impulse response by deconvolving the incident P-wavefield of teleseismic earthquakes (30\u201390 degrees epicentral distance) from the P-to-S (Ps) converted wavefield (Vinnik, 1977; Langston, 1979). Deconvolution equalises source and path effects, as well as the instrument response, to represent the Ps conversions as isolated pulses in time (Clayton and Wiggins, 1976; Langston, 1979; Ammon, 1991). An RF consists of the superimposition of the primary conversion of every interface (Ps) and multiple \u201cechoes\u201d of these interfaces (e.g., reflections\/conversions of downward propagating waves reflected at the free surface, PpPs, PsPs and PpSs). In cases of multi-layer models, multiples from shallower layers overprint and potentially disturb the primary conversions at deeper discontinuities and need to be considered in modelling. Inverse modelling of stacked RF waveforms provides one-dimensional crustal seismic velocity models beneath the recording stations (Owens et al., 1987; Ammon et al., 1990; Cassidy and Ellis, 1993; Sandvol et al., 1998; Darbyshire, 2003; Ottem\u00f6ller and Midzi, 2003). RFs can also be jointly inverted with complementary seismological information such as surface waves and incident wave polarisations (e.g. Juli\u00e0 et al., 2000; Kiselev et al., 2008; Schiffer et al., 2019).\nHere, we obtain 1D velocity models of the crust and uppermost mantle, by simultaneously inverting two datasets produced from the raw three-component seismograms: P-receiver functions and P-wave polarisations. We generate P-receiver functions using water level deconvolution (Clayton and Wiggins, 1976; Langston, 1979; Ammon, 1991) applying a gaussian factor of 2.5 for low-pass filtering. The dominant frequency of the RF signal is ~1\u00a0Hz, resulting in a theoretical vertical resolution for converted waves of ~4\u00a0km at Moho depth (assuming a resolution of 1\/2 wavelength and velocities of 7\u20138\u00a0km\/s, e.g. Bostock, 1999; Rychert et al., 2007). The water level in the deconvolution is chosen to suppress noise (high water-level for noisier data), but it also has the unwanted effect of suppressing some of the actual signal, especially at higher frequencies. Special care must thus be taken to select an optimal water level. This can either be done subjectively via trial and error (here with values of 0.1 or 0.01, depending on the noise level), or objectively by basing the water level on the pre-event noise of the vertical component as is done in the GLImER database workflow of Rondenay et al. (2017). All RFs at each station were averaged and no moveout correction was applied, as this would distort either of the primary or multiple phases and we regard the simple stack of RF waveforms as the best compromise.\nThe second dataset, the polarisation of incident teleseismic P-waves, provides information on the absolute S-wave velocity distribution in the shallow subsurface (Svenningsen and Jacobsen, 2007). This information is retrieved from the ratio of the radial (R) to the vertical (Z) RFs, i.e., R-RF\/Z-RF, at zero delay time of the RFs (Svenningsen and Jacobsen, 2007). The obtained velocities are in fact apparent velocities (Vs\n\napp\n) of the vertical velocity structure, covered by the dominant wavelength of the incident wave. Using increasing periods\/wavelengths of the incident waveform, these apparent velocities capture greater depths beneath the recording stations, which then can be inverted to obtain an absolute velocity model with depth. This principle has recently been applied to both onshore and offshore studies (Schiffer et al., 2015a; Hannemann et al., 2016; Schiffer et al., 2016b; Chong et al., 2018). We produce curves of Vs\n\napp\n at increasing periods (T), following the procedure by Svenningsen and Jacobsen (2007). Each individual RF is used to calculate distinct Vs\n\napp\n\n(T) curves, while the median curve is considered to give the most robust representation. The periods are defined as a set of 26 discrete values on a logarithmic scale from 1 to 25\u00a0s, which corresponds to approximately 1\u2013200\u00a0km depth range (assuming a minimum Vs of 1\u00a0km\/s and a maximum of 8\u00a0km\/s). The data error is given as the standard deviation of the 68% Vs\n\napp\n\n(T)-curves closest to the median.\nThe employed inverse algorithm is based on the one presented in Schiffer et al. (2019) and previous versions (Schiffer et al., 2015a, 2016b), but with major modifications. In the present study, we combine a linearised iterative least squares inversion as in previous publications of the authors applying (based on Tarantola and Valette, 1982; Menke, 1989; Ammon et al., 1990) with a new random model search scheme. For every station, 1000 full linearised iterative LSQ inversion runs were calculated with a minimum of 15 iterations and vastly different starting models, randomly covering the parameter space. Each starting model has a randomly chosen velocity distribution (between Vs\u00a0=\u00a01 and Vs\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0km\/s) and a randomly varying number of layers (between 5 and 20) and layer thicknesses, with the only imposed restrictions being that each starting model is monotonically increasing in velocity with depth and that the lowermost layer must have a Vs larger than 4.2\u00a0km\/s.\nThe synthetic waveforms are calculated from the 1-D velocity models with the method of Kennett (1983), deconvolved using water-level deconvolution (Clayton and Wiggins, 1976; Langston, 1979; Ammon, 1991) and finally convolved with the observed teleseismic wavelet (deconvolved longitudinal (L-) component \u2013 the component rotated and pointing in the direction of the apparent incidence angle using the Vs\n\napp\n at the lowest period of 1\u00a0s) to simulate the full RF response for every forward model with all its complexity. Synthetic Vs\napp is calculated from the synthetic Z- and R-components.\nEach individual inversion yields a model and data error (Qd and Qm) defined as the root mean square errors relative to the starting model and observed data, weighted with the respective prior uncertainties (based on observed data covariances). There is also an additional roughness error (Qr), defined by the second derivative of the velocity model. The sum of these error terms results in a total error Q (see Schiffer et al. (2016b) for details).\nFor each of the 1000 individual inversion runs, the 10 last iterations before termination of the inversion are saved, resulting in a total of 10,000 models forming a posterior model population. Depending on starting model and data quality, the speed of convergence and the number of iterations needed to reach convergence differs. If the data are \u201cless non-unique\u201d, show little noise, and the underlying geology is simple, the inversion should effectively converge, which means that the last 10 saved iterations should be very similar. Vice versa, if the data are non-unique, noisy, and reflect a very complex subsurface the inversion may not effectively converge, in which case the last 10 iterations may represent a much larger spread of velocity models. Taking an average model of these 10 hypothetical solutions will result in a small and large posterior model error (or model uncertainty), respectively.\nThe RFs are modelled from \u22121 to 20\u00a0s delay time with respect to the direct P-arrival at 0\u00a0s and Vs\n\napp\n at periods from 1 to 25\u00a0s. A priori data errors based on the independent data covariance matrices are used to automatically weigh the individual datasets. That is, if one dataset shows a larger spread, the observed error is large and the weight of the respective dataset is reduced in the inversion. Velocities and depths\/delay times are virtually unconstrained in the inversion, meaning that both model parameters can freely change without causing any model error, with one exception: the lowermost mantle half-space velocity is tied to a velocity of Vs\u00a0=\u00a04.6\u00a0km\/s by an a priori model error of 0.2\u00a0km\/s, forcing the lowermost velocity to settle around \u201cambient mantle\u201d velocities.\nThe non-uniqueness of the inverse problem is reduced by parameterising layers in terms of delay-time instead of thickness (Jacobsen and Svenningsen, 2008). RF inversion is primarily sensitive to Vs, but requires Vp model parameters, which mainly affect the delay time of Ps phases. In our approach, the inversion is not technically estimating Vp as an independent model parameter, but Vp is coupled to Vs by a predefined Vs-dependent Vp\/Vs ratio lookup table, roughly based on common lithologies (Christensen, 1996) in the following way: We employ increasing Vp\/Vs ratios with decreasing Vs below 3.0\u00a0km\/s with a maximum of 1.85 at 1\u00a0km\/s. For Vs\u00a0=\u00a03.0\u20133.5\u00a0km\/s we use a Vp\/Vs ratio of 1.73. Above Vs\u00a0=\u00a03.5\u00a0km\/s, the Vp\/Vs ratios increase to a peak of 1.8 at 4.1\u00a0km\/s, after which they decrease again to 1.75 at 4.6\u00a0km\/s. For Vs\u00a0>\u00a04.6, the Vp\/Vs ratios increase and plateau at a Vp\/Vs of 1.78.\nSuch an approximation can obviously not account for overlaps between seismic parameters of different lithologies and also doesn't capture all lithologies, for example basalts, quartz-rich, dry sedimentary rocks or evaporites. However, using such an approximate Vp-Vs relationship stabilises the inversion immensely. Densities are calculated from Vp at different depth (Christensen and Mooney, 1995).\nExamples of the progression of an iterative inversion for one starting model is shown in Fig. 4\n. The error is usually reduced at each iteration of the inversion, which ends when the models and errors converge, i.e. changes of less than 1% are observed for more than 2 iterations.\n\n\n4\nSeismological data\nWe collected passive, broadband, three-component seismological data from various public sources. Raw data from 24 stations were collected through the data services of EIDA (http:\/\/www.orfeus-eu.org\/data\/eida\/), IRIS (http:\/\/service.iris.edu\/) and the Canadian National Data Centre (CNDC). The stations belong to POLARIS network, the Canadian National Seismic Network, the Danish Seismological Network, and other temporary networks used in previous studies (e.g. Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003; Darbyshire, 2003; Kumar et al., 2007; Gilligan et al., 2016; Darbyshire et al., 2017). For the closely spaced, temporally separated stations ILULI and ILUG, we combined the data and refer to the resulting dataset as ILUG\/ILULI in the following. Computed receiver functions from 10 temporary stations in West Greenland were retrieved from the global receiver function database GLImER (Rondenay et al., 2017). Depending on recording time and data quality, the various stations yielded between 9 and 448 processable events that had magnitudes between 5.1 and 9.1 and were located in the teleseismic distance ranges (30\u201390\u00b0 epicentral distance). This resulted in a total dataset of 3490 events for all stations (~103 events on average per station) that was used for further RF\/P-wave polarisation processing and inversion.\n\n\n5\nCrustal model interpretation\nThe applied inverse approach produces a distribution of 10,000 models for each station. A model histogram is created from these 10,000 models, where every model is weighted with the inverse data error, giving a higher count to models with a better data fit (Fig. 5\n). The final model is defined as the mean of the weighted population at every depth.\nAlthough the model describes the vertical velocity structure of the entire crust and the uppermost mantle (according to the assumptions, approximations, limitations and inverse procedure described), our study focusses on two specific measures of crustal structure: 1) the crust-mantle transition, and 2) the thickness of HVLC.\nSeveral challenges in interpreting the nature and structure of the crust-mantle transition using the 1D models were encountered. Our interpretation is based on the assumption that the lithospheric stratification beneath the stations is one-dimensional, which likely presents an oversimplification of the structure. However, in the presence of only minor three-dimensional variations in a radius of ~10\u201315\u00a0km around a station this is a reasonable assumption at the scale of the interpretation (e.g. Rondenay, 2009). In the case of highly variable crustal architecture beneath a station, the RF stack will represent an average of the different individual waveforms and, hence, the obtained model will similarly be a representation of this averaged waveform. Experience shows that in the presence of lateral structural gradients, for example in Moho depth, sharp discontinuities will start to appear smoother in the waveforms due to stacking of the converted phase at different delay times, as well as in the obtained velocity model. In other words, a sharp, but substantially dipping discontinuity may appear as a velocity gradient.\nThis potential issue also affects the interpretation of the HVLC layer. An apparent Moho gradient and\/or HVLC-like velocities may be real, but could also be the effect of this smearing in the presence of strong lateral three-dimensional variation.\nIn addition, the vertical velocity structure of the crust-mantle transition may in fact be complex including an actual velocity gradient, which could represent several structural complexities (gradually intruded lower crust, low uppermost mantle velocities, mechanical mixing in the crust-mantle transition zone, etc.). Here, we face the problem of defining and effectively distinguishing between an actual Moho gradient and the HVLC, not least because they may both be characterised by similar overlapping velocity ranges, but also because they may be caused by the same lower crustal\/upper mantle lithologies and their alterations. Unless we can clearly distinguish a Moho gradient and the HVLC as two separate structures with visible discontinuities, we regard both features as the same unit.\nConsidering these challenges in making an unequivocal interpretation of the results, we define the geological interfaces as follows:\n\n-\nThe upper boundary of the crust-mantle transition is defined as the depth where the velocity model exceeds a Vs of 4.25\u00a0km\/s. The lower boundary of the crust-mantle transition is defined at the depth where the velocity model displays a major reduction in velocity gradient occurring at Vs\u00a0>\u00a04.4\u00a0km\/s. The final \u201cMoho discontinuity\u201d used for regional interpretations is defined halfway between these two interfaces, although obviously it is not an actual discontinuity in case of a gradient.\n\n\n\n\n-\nThe upper boundary of the HVLC is defined at the depth where the velocity model exceeds Vs\u00a0=\u00a04.1\u00a0km\/s, which represents the Vs corresponding to frequently observed Vp in HVLC. However, being aware of the model uncertainties, a visual interpretation of the model was made allowing us to define the top HVLC as the location where we observe clear velocity changes, which can sometimes occur at velocities as low as Vs\u00a0=\u00a04.0\u00a0km\/s. The top HVLC must always be associated with a visible velocity gradient. The HVLC thickness is defined from the upper HVLC interface to the Moho. As a result of this HVLC definition, every station will return a non-null HVLC thickness. Considering the uncertainties and limitations in resolution of the model, we only consider HVLC thicknesses of \u2265\u00a01\u00a0km as a robust result, which partly accounts for the vertical resolution of a P-wave at this depth for the used frequency content used (3.2\u00a0km corresponds to a half wavelength at 6.5\u00a0km\/s and 1\u00a0Hz). In the final model displayed in the Result section, we therefore subtract 1\u00a0km of HVLC thickness and display the remaining thickness (and minimum 0\u00a0km) that we consider as robust.\n\n\n-\nOur estimated Moho uncertainty (which also translates into the HVLC uncertainty) then consists of two factors: The first is the modelling uncertainty, which is derived from the standard deviations of the model population, defined by the average of depth differences between the Moho depth (top and bottom crust-mantle transition zone) and the respective model standard deviation. The second is the uncertainty based on the fact that the Moho may be an actual gradient, which makes the definition\/approximation as a discontinuity geologically uncertain.\n\n\n\nOther, shallower interfaces that are not focus of this study were identified according to the following criteria (see Fig. 5): (1) a shallow sedimentary layer is defined as a velocity discontinuity that crosses Vs\u00a0~\u00a02.5\u00a0km\/s; (2) a deeper sedimentary layer or uppermost crustal layer boundary is defined where a discontinuity crosses Vs\u00a0~\u00a03\u00a0km\/s; and (3) a mid-crustal discontinuity is defined at the strongest discontinuity between 10\u00a0km depth and the top of HVLC\/crust mantle transition.\n\n\n6\nResults\n\n6.1\nCrustal thickness and Moho depth\nThe station-by-station Moho depth estimates surrounding the Labrador Sea, Davis Strait and Baffin Bay show values that range between ~32\u00a0km and\u00a0~\u00a047\u00a0km (Fig. 6\n, Table 1\n). Although the dataset is sparse and irregularly distributed over the study area (Fig. 1), some spatial relationships and trends of Moho depth and tectonic boundaries and terranes can be inferred. Overall, the Moho depth estimates from RF inversion in the study area are comparable to previously published data and regional models that are almost entirely based on independent data (Welford and Hall, 2013; Welford et al., 2018; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2019), which is therefore a good first indication that the estimates are geologically meaningful. However, locally we see considerable differences, which demonstrates the importance of the present work in providing reference points for regional compilations and models.\nOn the West Greenland margin, the regional trend in Moho depth is consistent with the compiled reference model (combination of ArcCrust, Crust1.0 and crustal models from Welford and Hall, 2013; Welford et al., 2018)), although we obtain generally deeper Moho estimates than previously suggested (Fig. 7\n). The northern stations on the West Greenland margin (TULEG, KULLO, UPNV, NUUG) show Moho depths that are inconsistent with the reference model, but rather resemble the Moho depths further inland along the West Greenland coastline, which implies that thicker crust may reach closer to the coastline than previously interpreted. The 36\u00a0km deep Moho at TULEG is similar to estimates by Darbyshire (2003), Dahl-Jensen et al. (2003) and Kumar et al. (2007) with 35\u201340\u00a0km, 37\u00a0km and 36\u00a0km, respectively. Equally, similar estimates are observed at UPNV (~38\u00a0km, this study; ~35\u00a0km, Darbyshire, 2003; 38\u00a0km, Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003). Only Kumar et al. (2007) estimated a substantially shallower Moho depth of 32\u00a0km at station UPNV. The stations in the vicinity of outcrops of the Davis Strait Igneous Province (DSIP) (UMM, GDH, ASIG, ILUG\/ILULI) in central West Greenland clearly show thinned crust compared to the surrounding continental areas in West Greenland, which is also seen in ArcCrust. Dahl-Jensen et al. (2003) estimated a Moho depth of 36\u00a0km at station GDH, which is the same as our estimate. However, Kumar et al. (2007) again estimated a shallower Moho of 32\u00a0km. The boundary between the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen and the North Atlantic Craton was previously imaged by common conversion point stacking of RFs (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2016) and our inversion results are consistent with these results. Both studies suggest a NW-SE thinning of the crust from approximately 45\u201350\u00a0km in the boundary zone between both terranes to 35\u201340\u00a0km in the North Atlantic Craton. Both Dahl-Jensen et al. (2003) and Kumar et al. (2007) estimated a very deep Moho at station SFJ (47\u00a0km and 45\u00a0km), which is consistent with our estimate at SFJD (~46\u00a0km). The other two stations in the North Atlantic Craton (NUUK, PAAG) show consistently shallower Moho of ~37 and 38\u00a0km depth, respectively, compared to the other Precambrian domains in West Greenland. At these stations, Dahl-Jensen et al. (2003) estimated 38\u00a0km and 42\u00a0km deep Moho, and Kumar et al. (2007) estimated 35 and 41\u00a0km, respectively. In the Ketilidian Mobile Belt again slightly deeper Moho at ~40 and 44\u00a0km is apparent at the stations IVI and NRS which is consistent with the compiled reference model. Dahl-Jensen et al. (2003) previously estimated a Moho depth of 40\u00a0km at NRS.\nAlong the Canadian Northwest Atlantic margin, we observe more significant differences between our RF inversion results, previous RF studies, and the reference model (Fig. 7) (Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2019). At the northernmost station used in this study (GFNU), our RF inversion suggests a Moho transition between 40 and 45\u00a0km, similar to the maximum Moho depth on southernmost Ellesmere Island and Devon Island according to the reference model, but ~5\u20137.5\u00a0km deeper than estimates by Darbyshire (2003) and\u00a0~\u00a05\u00a0km deeper than estimates by Postlethwaite et al. (2014). The next station to the south (POIN\/PINU on northernmost Baffin Island) shows a shallow Moho at ~33\u00a0km depth, which is similar to the reference model in this area and most previous RF estimates (~35\u00a0km, Darbyshire, 2003 and Gilligan et al., 2016; ~34\u00a0km, Thompson et al., 2010; 31.5\u00a0km, Postlethwaite et al., 2014). Northern Baffin Island (stations CLRN, MRYN, MARC, B1NU and B2NU) is otherwise characterised by a relatively consistent moderate Moho depth of ~37\u201343\u00a0km, similar to the reference model and previous RF studies (Darbyshire, 2003; Gilligan et al., 2016), with exception of 35\u00a0km at station CLRN by Postlethwaite et al. (2014) and up to 44\u00a0km at B1NU by Thompson et al. (2010). Stations from southern Baffin Island (CMBN, PNGN, CDKN, FRB, KIMN) show a generally deeper Moho (~40\u201345\u00a0km) than those on northern Baffin Island. Although the differences between north and south are not extreme, it is curious because the reference model suggests the opposite tendency with deeper Moho in the north than in the south. This difference is most pronounced on the Cumberland Peninsula, southeastern Baffin Island (stations CMBN, PNGN), where we observe more than 5\u00a0km deeper Moho compared to the reference model and previous RF results (Thompson et al., 2010; Gilligan et al., 2016), with the exception of Postlethwaite et al. (2014), who estimated 33\u00a0km at station CMBN. Our Moho estimate at station FRB (45\u00a0km) is the same as estimated by Darbyshire (2003) and only slightly deeper than other models (Thompson et al., 2010; Postlethwaite et al., 2014). Stations CDKN and KIMN show similar Moho depth values as previous studies (Thompson et al., 2010; Postlethwaite et al., 2014), with the exception of a larger Moho depth at station KIMN by Postlethwaite et al. (2014). In the Nain province, we observe a 40\u00a0km deep Moho at station NANL on the central Labrador coast, approximately 5\u00a0km deeper than the reference model, similar to the Moho depth in northern Labrador and further inland (Funck and Louden, 1999; Funck et al., 2000b), but over 10\u00a0km deeper than estimated by Postlethwaite et al. (2014). At this location, Vervaet & Darbyshire (2022) estimated a Moho depth of ~35\u201340\u00a0km. However, considerably higher velocities were inferred in the uppermost layers (about 3.0\u20133.5\u00a0km\/s compared to 2.6\u00a0km\/s in this study), which could relate to a velocity pull-down explaining the difference in Moho depth. The estimated Moho depth in the Makkovik province (station MKVL) is 45\u00a0km which is similar to that in the Ketilidian Mobile Belt (stations NRS and IVIG) on the West Greenland conjugate margin, and slightly thinner than the ~45\u201350\u00a0km deep Moho estimated by Vervaet & Darbyshire (2022), but again considerably thicker than the estimate of 26\u00a0km by Postlethwaite et al. (2014).\nThe regional Moho depth variation on the Canadian Labrador-Baffin margin compares well with the West Greenland conjugate: Northern Baffin Island and the conjugate West Greenland Rae Craton\/Rinkian Orogen show moderate Moho depth; Southern Baffin Island and the conjugate Nagssugtoqidian Orogen have thick crust; The Nain and Makkovik Provinces show very similar results as the conjugate North Atlantic Craton and Ketilidian Mobile Belt, respectively.\nThese new RF results are important as they add reference points to new regional crustal models and provide a deeper understanding crustal processes and structure, whilst they also support the previously established existence of terrane boundaries and sutures in the region.\n\n\n6.2\nThickness of high velocity lower crust (HVLC)\nOur new RF inversion results from the Labrador Sea, Davis Strait and Baffin Bay margins indicate the presence of HVLC below the present-day onshore regions and allow a reinterpretation of the distribution and origin of these structures. As illustrated in previous sections, there are a number of challenges in the interpretation of these results, specifically: (a) interpreting the origin and age of HVLC, and (b) defining the exact vertical extent\/thickness of HVLC considering overlapping velocity ranges, Moho gradients and model uncertainty.\nThe results of the HVLC thickness are shown in Fig. 8\n, together with the interpretation of the HVLC type and origin, which will be discussed in later sections.\nIn West Greenland, there are clear indications of HVLC in the Disko Bay area with thicknesses of 4\u20135\u00a0km (stations NUUG, UMM, GDH, ASIG, SISG), with the exception of station ILUG\/ILULI where the HVLC thickness is negligible. Moderate thicknesses of 1\u20133\u00a0km were estimated at the stations immediately to the north (stations KULLO and UPNV) and south (stations SA1G\u20134G, NUUK, PAAG, IVIG) of the Disko Bay area. Only three stations show negligible HVLC thicknesses, and these are the northernmost station (TULEG), the easternmost station in the Disko Bay area (ILUG\/ILULI) and the southernmost station (NRS).\nOn the Canadian side, only two stations on the Cumberland Peninsula (PNGN and CMBN) exhibit thick HVLC of 4\u20135\u00a0km. These are surrounded primarily by stations indicating thin HVLC of 1\u20132\u00a0km, after subtraction of 1 km (CLRN, B2NU, CDKN, JENN, FRB, KIMN), which is close to the detection limit of RFs. The southernmost station in the Makkovik Province (MKVL) also shows a HVLC of only 1-2\u00a0km. Moderately thick HVLC (1\u20133\u00a0km) is found in the north (GFNU, POIN\/PINU, MRYN\/MARN). Station B1NU with a HVLC thickness of 2\u00a0km is situated in the vicinity of otherwise thinner HVLC.\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nImplications for regional crustal models\nWe collected teleseismic data from all available seismic stations around the Northwest Atlantic and estimated crustal structure using RF inversion. Our model has the advantage that we are treating all available stations with the same methodology, compared to previous studies that treated various sub-datasets with different methods and processing steps. Most previous RF estimates were based on H-\u03ba stacking, which treats the crust as a single layer and cannot account for crust-mantle transition zones, the presence of HVLC or other intra-crustal complexities \u2013 all important complementary information which we focus our interpretations on.\nOur new Moho results from West Greenland are generally more consistent with the regional crustal reference models (root mean square difference of 3.7\u00a0km) than those from the Canadian margin (root mean square difference of 5.5\u00a0km) (Fig. 7). Of 34 stations at which the Moho depth was estimated, 25 estimates indicate a deeper Moho than the crustal reference model, while only 9 stations indicate a shallower Moho depth, indicating that there is a systematic tendency of the RF inversion (and interpretation of the velocity models) towards a deeper Moho depth than the Moho suggested by the regional reference model.\nAcross West Greenland, changes in Moho depth appear to be dependent on defined tectonic provinces, as shown in a schematic cross section (Fig. 9a). In the north, the Moho depth is relatively shallow under the Rae Craton, increasing in depth following the transition to the crust of the Rinkian Orogen. The Nagssugtoqidian Orogen generally displays the thickest crust in West Greenland, together with the Disko Bay area, which also shows clear evidence for crustal thinning likely related to magmatism and rifting. The Moho depth increases southwards to the boundary with the North Atlantic Craton, likely related to the amalgamation of Greenland. The remaining crust of the North Atlantic Craton is generally thinner than this orogenic\/sutured crust. In the south, the Ketilidian Mobile Belt in southernmost Greenland exhibits thicker crust than the North Atlantic Craton. Finally, the Disko Bay area clearly shows evidence for crustal thinning, likely related to magmatism and rifting, confirming earlier studies.\nOn the Canadian side (Fig. 9b), we emphasise the following main features: (i) A consistent north-south Moho depth increase on Baffin Island. The Rae Craton has the overall thinnest crust, followed by the northern segment of the Trans-Hudson Orogen on Baffin Island and finally the southern segment of the Trans-Hudson Orogen with clearly thickest crust, which supports the notion of the Baffin Suture dividing Baffin Island. Curiously, this is the opposite trend than what the reference crustal model depicts. (ii) The Central Labrador coast comprises thick crust, which appears to be related to the Torngat Orogen, clearly mapped in the north of Labrador by previous seismic surveys. (iii) The Makkovik province (station MKVL) has a deep Moho, in the same range as the conjugate Ketilidian Mobile Belt. Our Moho depth estimate at MKVL seems to be robust, and recent RF inversion results from a different code and approach suggests a very similar depth (Vervaet & Darbyshire 2022). However, this estimate is ~13\u00a0km deeper than the reference model and published controlled source seismic models in the Makkovik Province (Louden and Fan, 1998), which may indicate a complex crust-mantle transition zone.\n\n\n7.2\nExtent and origin of high velocity lower crust\nAs explained before, knowing which type of HVLC is present in the lower crust can provide key insight into the past geodynamic events that have affected a region, such as igneous activity, mantle serpentinisation and orogeny. In the following section, we will first present an interpretation of our new results combined with results from previous studies, by assigning observed lower-crustal structure to the four main types of possible HVLC; i) igneous, ii) pre-existing metamorphic, iii) syn-rift exhumed and serpentinised mantle, and iv) cratonic lower crust type HVLC body. Then we will discuss the distribution of these different types of HVLC across the NW Atlantic (Fig. 10\n). Our interpretations are guided by surface geology, as limited other information is available, and we recognise that more complex structures may exist and that the mapped geology may be incomplete. The new models of HVLC thickness, in relation to existing data as well as regional geology and tectonics, allow for an improved interpretation of the distribution of HVLC and its origin. This improved interpretation is based on spatial correlation with volcanic provinces, known suture zones and terrane boundaries, or with crustal and lithospheric thickness. All HVLC thickness interpretations and all values mentioned are based on the RF inversion estimates with 1 km subtracted in order to account for uncertainties. HVLC thickness below 1 km is therefore assumed to be negligible\/non-existent.\nWhere HVLC is in the vicinity of, or coincident with, other observations of igneous rocks of the Davis Strait Igneous Province (DSIP), we interpret these structures as a mafic underplate, or lower crustal intrusions related to DSIP magmatism, unless evidence suggests otherwise. Similarly, if HVLC is found in the vicinity or as an extrapolation of known tectonic boundaries or in orogens and mobile belts, we consider the possibility that HVLC represents a fossil metamorphosed crustal root. For example, the HVLC beneath the Davis Strait may partly originate from rifting which led to deformation and redistribution of metamorphosed lower crust, rather than entirely from igneous processes, as often assumed (Funck et al., 2007; Gerlings et al., 2009; Funck et al., 2012; Keen et al., 2012; Hosseinpour et al., 2013; Suckro et al., 2013). In areas where we see thinned crust and HVLC in direct contact with sedimentary successions, HVLC may be indicative of syn-rift exhumed mantle. We also use the distribution of different HVLC bodies and their interpretation in a palaeogeographic reconstruction (Fig. 11\n) in order to evaluate whether or not HVLC of the same type is spatially related. In addition, the interplay between HVLC and Moho depth is another good indicator for the type of HVLC: lower crustal intrusions may more commonly appear in regions of thinned crust, whilst orogenic-type HVLC rather occurs in thickened crust (but obviously with some exceptions).\nIn West Greenland, the estimated HVLC in the Disko Bay area corresponds well with mapped occurrences of igneous rocks in the region. A DSIP-origin of the HVLC in this area is supported by the observations between 67\u00b0N (station ASIG) and 71\u00b0N (Upernavik, station UPNV) (Fig. 9). Whether or not HVLC as far north as 73\u00b0N (station KULLO) is related to the DSIP is uncertain as the estimated HVLC thickness is decreasing and no Palaeogene igneous products were mapped on- or offshore (Fig. 2). The potential continuation of the DSIP in this area may be investigated in future studies. On mainland Greenland opposite to Disko Island, the HVLC thickness is negligible (station ILUG\/ILULI). We interpret this station to mark the eastern limit of the DSIP in this area. More data are required to map the extent, thickness and structural relationships of HVLC in this area.\nTo the south, station SISG, the closest to the coastline of 5 stations in a temporary array in central West Greenland (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2016), shows thick HVLC (Figs. 8-10). Although in the onshore there are no reported outcrops of Palaeogene igneous rocks, there is evidence for such rocks in the offshore (Funck et al., 2012; Suckro et al., 2013; Abdelmalak et al., 2019). Therefore, it is possible that the HVLC at SISG is of igneous nature, which would imply that the DSIP has affected the area.\nImmediately to the east of SISG, the other 4 temporary stations (SA1G-SA4G) cross the boundary between the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen and North Atlantic Craton (Figs. 8-10). The HVLC estimated here is considerably thinner (2\u20134\u00a0km) than at SISG. A similar thickness (4\u20135\u00a0km) was estimated at station SFJD further east, which is still close to the elusive tectonic boundary. We interpret this HVLC as a possible remnant of the orogenic processes that resulted from the collision of the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen and North Atlantic Craton.\nStation NUUK displays a moderately thick HVLC of ~2.5\u00a0km. Only minor intrusions are mapped in the area and a sill complex is mapped in the offshore, but there is no evidence for HVLC in the offshore (Funck et al., 2007). Furthermore, station NUUK is at considerable distance to known suture zones or terrane boundaries. We cannot make strong inferences about the origin of this estimated HVLC, and it may be either related to igneous processes, or could represent a cratonic-type lower crustal layer of the North Atlantic Craton.\nThe stations in South Greenland (PAAG, IVI, NRS) show varying HVLC thicknesses (Figs. 8-10). The HVLC at PAAG, the northernmost of these, is ~2\u00a0km thick, followed by a thickness of ~5\u00a0km at IVI and negligible thickness at the southernmost station, NRS. None of these stations can be related to Palaeogene igneous rocks, but a Cretaceous dyke swarm follows the coastline in this area (Larsen et al., 2009). Here, the continent-ocean transition is interpreted to be close to the present-day coastline due to a very narrow shelf (Dunbar and Sawyer, 1989; Chian et al., 1995b; Chian et al., 1995a; Chalmers and Pulvertaft, 2001; Peace et al., 2016) and the nature of the offshore HVLC is debated (e.g. Chian et al., 1995b). The distal part of the offshore HVLC is likely in contact with sediments, which could allow transport of water into the mantle during rifting and makes a serpentinised mantle type HVLC a likely candidate. Vice versa, the proximal part of the HVLC underlies continental crust and for the same reasons, a hydrated, serpentinised mantle type HVLC is here rather unlikely. Therefore, the nature of the thick HVLC at PAAG and IVI is uncertain: At PAAG the HVLC could either represent moderate lower crustal intrusions or a cratonic lower crust of the North Atlantic Craton; At IVIG, the HVLC may represent a local igneous alteration of the lower crust, possibly breakup related, or it could be related to the North Atlantic Craton-Ketilidian boundary and thereby collision processes.\nOn the Canadian side, the only estimates of HVLC from this study that could possibly relate to the DSIP are those on the Cumberland Peninsula (stations PNGN, CMBN). These three stations have an HVLC that is 5\u20136\u00a0km thick, which is noticeably thicker than the estimates at other stations on Baffin Island. However, in this area there is no evidence of Palaeogene igneous rocks or any other magmatism, except for the HVLC of the Davis Strait offshore and outcrops at the easternmost tip of Cumberland Peninsula \u2013 both of these locations are at more than 100\u00a0km distance to stations PNGN and CMBN. Another process that could explain this thick HVLC is the amalgamation of the Trans-Hudson Orogen. Indeed, an intra-Trans-Hudson Orogen terrane boundary, the Baffin Suture, separates southern and northern Baffin Island (Corrigan et al., 2009; St-Onge et al., 2009) and this boundary is close to stations PNGN and CMBN. The HVLC along this boundary could therefore represent preserved metamorphic rocks related to suturing of Palaeoproterozoic terranes. Nevertheless, interpretation of this HVLC remains speculative and requires more work and supporting data to establish spatial and structural relationships. All other estimates on Baffin and Devon Island show HVLC thicknesses of 2\u20134\u00a0km, generally thicker in the north than in the south and we relate these estimates to a lower crustal layer that can sometimes be observed in cratonic areas (England and Ebbing, 2012; Thybo and Artemieva, 2013; Schulte-Pelkum et al., 2017).\nNorthern Labrador has been previously shown to be underlain by more than 5\u00a0km thick HVLC related to Palaeoproterozoic collision of the Archean Nain Province (Funck and Louden, 1999; Funck et al., 2000b). The thick HVLC at station NANL (central Labrador coast) likely represents the southward continuation of the Palaeoproterozoic Torngat Orogen and similar amalgamation processes between the Nain Province\/North Atlantic Craton to the east with Palaeoproterozoic terranes to the west. An igneous interpretation of this HVLC relating to the DSIP is unlikely, due to the lack of Mesozoic-Cenozoic magmatism in the immidiate surroundings.\nOnly very thin or no HVLC was estimated in the Makkovik province (MKVL), the southernmost station of this study. Peace et al. (2016) have found only little evidence for rift-related magmatism in the Makkovik Province and our estimates are in agreement with a coincident seismic refraction line showing only the presence of a minimal HVLC layer (Louden and Fan, 1998). We prefer an orogenic-type HVLC in this area, related to Grenvillian tectonics (Funck et al., 2001).\nMaps showing the distribution of the three major types of HVLC, i.e., 1) igneous\/magmatic, 2) orogenic and 3) syn-rift exhumed mantle type in relation to LAB and Moho depths are shown on Fig. 8. A final map integrating all the available information and depicting our preferred distribution of HVLC types is shown in Fig. 10, and its reconstruction at 62\u00a0Ma in Fig. 11.\n\nFig. 8a shows the maximum extent of possible igneous-type HVLC. The new data suggest substantial HLVC on the West Greenland margin and on the Cumberland Peninsula on Baffin Island that we regard as candidates for being related to DSIP igneous activity, based primarily on their vicinity to volcanic products onshore and offshore. Furthermore we infer that all HVLC along the Labrador Sea conjugate margins could potentially be of igneous nature (Chian and Louden, 1994; Chian et al., 1995b; Chalmers, 1997), but especially those that are interpreted to be located beneath a layer of intact continental crust in the rifted margin. In such cases, it seems unlikely that water is transported\/circulated through the remaining crystalline crust in order to hydrate and serpentinise the uppermost mantle.\n\nFig. 8b shows the extent of HVLC interpreted here to potentially represent pre-existing metamorphic material in the lower crust. This interpretation is primarily based on the vicinity of these locations to known terrane boundaries and suture zones, such as on the Cumberland Peninsula (Baffin Bay Suture), along the Labrador margin (Torngat Orogen), as well as in the vicinity of the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen-North Atlantic Craton boundary and the Ketilidian Mobile Belt. We furthermore suggest that a substantial part of the HVLC beneath Davis Strait may represent deformed lower (metamorphosed) continental crust of the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen that flowed during the oblique and inheritance-assisted rifting process filling the area forming the Davis Strait, similar to models suggested for the Greenland-Iceland-Faroes Ridge in the Northeast Atlantic (Petersen et al., 2018; Foulger et al., 2020).\n\nFig. 8c shows the occurrences of HVLC that can potentially be related to syn-rift mantle serpentinisation. However, as noted above, methodological limitations place potential caveats on these interpretations. In cases where the HVLC is in direct contact with sedimentary successions, we interpret a hydrated mantle as a very likely source as opposed to occurrences of HVLC beneath a thinned, but still-intact continental crustal layer.\nFor all other HVLC bodies for which we cannot find spatial relationships with other geological structures, inferences regarding the origin of HVLC involved too much uncertainty. Many of the occurrences of HVLC in the interior of cratons may be related to a cratonic lower crustal layer that has been observed in numerous regions (e.g. Christensen and Mooney, 1995; England and Ebbing, 2012; Schulte-Pelkum et al., 2017). As already discussed, HVLC can frequently be observed in cratons but they are not ubiquitous. The origin of these bodies is not conclusively understood, but could be related to melt residues, presence of eclogite, or generally crustal formation or modification processes in Archean-Palaeoproterozoic geodynamic settings (Schmidt, 2000; Kukkonen et al., 2008; England and Ebbing, 2012; Schulte-Pelkum et al., 2017).\nOur final regional interpretation is presented in Fig. 10. We suggest that the DSIP continues further north on the West Greenland margin than previously mapped. HVLC on the southern West Greenland margin may be part of the DSIP as well, but this interpretation has a higher degree of uncertainty. The lower crust on the Cumberland Peninsula (Baffin Island) may have also been affected by DSIP activity. However, here the close vicinity to the Baffin Suture makes a pre-existing metamorphic origin of this HVLC more likely. The HVLC along the Labrador Sea margins could be explained by several models - igneous injection, metamorphism or syn-rift serpentinisation and based on the available data, we cannot identify a preferred model and suggest a thorough re-investigation and interpretation for future studies. Through our systematic evaluation of possible scenarios, we determined that the most likely one is a metamorphic\/orogenic origin for the HVLC mapped along the eastern Labrador coast, in the vicinity of the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen-North Atlantic Craton boundary, as well as in the Ketilidian Mobile Belt.\nThe relative location of HVLC bodies at 62\u00a0Ma using a reconstruction by Abdelmalak et al., (2019) gives further insight into the origin of HVLC (Fig. 11). The potential igneous HVLC now forms a continuous area from northern Baffin Bay to the southern Labrador Sea, except for the bodies on the Cumberland Peninsula, which seem less well-aligned compared to all other HVLC observed. Instead, HVLC on the Cumberland Peninsula may be more likely of orogenic origin, as now the Baffin Suture lines up with the conjugate boundary between Nagssugtoqidian and Rae Craton in West Greenland, forming a lineament of potentially orogenic metamorphosed lower crust. The HVLC potentially formed by syn-rift mantle exhumation and hydration defines a continuous area in the very south of the investigated HVLC bodies, however the HVLC branching out towards the Labrador coast appears to be different and has no corresponding body on the conjugate margin. Furthermore, there is a gap between this offshore HVLC and the HVLC imaged onshore, which may indicate that these are separate bodies. Therefore, it may be more likely that these bodies formed through igneous processes.\nAn improved distinction between the different types of HVLC will come from future investigations combining coincident, high-resolution datasets from complementary geophysical approaches (gravity, magnetics, different seismic methods, magnetotellurics, etc.) with detailed structural models.\n\n\n7.3\nStructural and magmatic development of the Northwest Atlantic\nThe volcanic products of the DSIP are clearly related to the Davis Strait bathymetric high, as well as thickened crust and lithosphere, which suggests a common generic formation process (Fig. 9). Furthermore, we see a clear asymmetry in the distribution of volcanic products (Fig. 9) and coincident sediment-accumulation zones\/basins (Fig. 3b), with flipped polarity from north to south (i.e., contrasting volcanism and sedimentary deposition between the eastern Baffin Bay margin and the western Labrador Sea margin). This asymmetry has been noted in other first-order structural aspects of the margins (Peace et al., 2016). The fact that the Davis Strait incorporates a major transfer system, regional control on the distribution of sedimentation and magmatism (Peace et al., 2017; Peace et al., 2018b; Heron et al., 2019; Schiffer et al., 2020), volcanism with ambiguous geochemistry and petrology (Hole, 2015; Clarke and Beutel, 2020; Hole and Natland, 2020) and the simple correlation between extensive igneous products and continental structures all suggest that tectonic processes and inheritance play a major role in the development of the Northwest Atlantic. The magmatic products in Baffin Bay are concentrated on the eastern margin, along the Rinkian Orogen, which may suggest some type of reactivation of Rinkian orogenic structures during breakup of Baffin Bay, as noted by Schiffer et al. (2020). Petersen and Schiffer (2016) have studied the effect of various types of orogenic inheritance on rifting and magnetism and see a clear asymmetry in both margin architecture and magnetic products depending on various pre-existing structural configurations, which could be applied to the Northwest Atlantic. Moreover, Heron et al. (2019) and Clarke and Beutel (2020) have investigated other aspects and other types of structural inheritance that may explain some of these observations in the Northwest Atlantic.\nSimilar to models developed for the Northeast Atlantic, the structural and magmatic peculiarities could be caused by an oblique interaction of a propagating rift with inherited crustal structures, such as the ancient crustal root of the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen, which also may have caused structural complexity in form of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroes Ridge at a very similar location on the eastern side of Greenland (Foulger et al., 2020; Schiffer et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThis study presents new crustal velocity models, and therewith estimates of Moho depth and the thickness of HVLC. These two elements provide important new insight into the geodynamic and magmatic evolution in the area. Although a considerable amount of data on the crustal structure exist offshore of the Labrador Sea, Davis Strait and Baffin Bay, deep structural information is limited onshore. The results provide crucial data to map Moho depth and the extent of HVLC, which contribute to updated interpretations of the regional models, as well as interpretations of the extent of the Davis Strait Igneous Province, the presence of fossil collision\/subduction zones and sutures\/terrane boundaries.\n\n8.1\nExtent of the Davis Strait Igneous Province\nThe new data allow us to infer that the Davis Strait Igneous Province (DSIP) might continue further north than previously thought in West Greenland, where two stations show evidence for HVLC. In addition, there are also some possible indications of DSIP-related HVLC to the south. However, we cannot rule out an alternative HVLC model such as metamorphosed lower crust, especially in South Greenland (Figs. 9 and 10). The cross section along the West Greenland margin clearly indicates maximum HVLC thickness centred in central West Greenland (Disko Bay area) decreasing to the north and south, with some local anomalies that we relate to orogenic processes. On the Canadian side, there might be a possibility that the Cumberland Peninsula was affected by the DSIP given that two stations show thick HVLC, but we prefer an interpretation as an orogenic-type HVLC here, due to the vicinity of the stations to the Baffin Suture. Though these inferences appear significant, more data is clearly required.\n\n\n8.2\nFossil collision zones and terranes\nThe new evidence from crustal thickness\/Moho depth and HVLC supports the existence of major collision zones\/terrane boundaries. We confirm the existence of a suture zone between the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen and North Atlantic Craton, which was already shown by RF common conversion point imaging (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2016), but now we can also relate this boundary to HVLC in addition to a clear Moho step. In SE Baffin Island, we estimated a thick HVLC that likely relates to the Baffin Suture and Trans-Hudson orogenic processes. Furthermore, we see evidence for a continuation of the thick HVLC keel along the Labrador margin that is interpreted to be the remnant of a metamorphosed lower crustal body originating from the Torngat Orogen (Funck and Louden, 1999). Lastly, the thick HVLC mapped in the Ketilidian Province of South Greenland may relate to similar collisional processes, while we consider a relationship to the DSIP as rather unlikely. Although much of the HVLC mapped offshore by previous seismic studies suggests an igneous origin, we note that substantial volumes of HVLC beneath Davis Strait may be of inherited, orogenic type (Gernigon et al., 2004; Petersen and Schiffer, 2016; Schiffer et al., 2016a), such that the igneous volume might be smaller in these areas than previously thought.\nThe schematic cross-sections shown in Fig. 9 clearly show changes both in Moho depth and HVLC thickness across or along boundaries between terranes and provinces: The Rae Craton consistently has relatively shallow Moho (35\u201340\u00a0km, with exception of station CLRN); The Trans-Hudson Orogen and Nagssugtoqidian Orogen have deeper Moho (~39\u201345\u00a0km); The North Atlantic Craton and Nain Province have a Moho depth of ~30\u201335\u00a0km (with exception of stations located close to the Nagssugtoqidian Orogen -North Atlantic Craton boundary); the Makkovik-Ketilidian Mobile Belt shows deeper Moho (~40\u201345\u00a0km).\nThe new RF inversion results on the crustal structure in the Northwest Atlantic region add new reference points for the future development of regional models, for comparisons with other studies and for estimates of the extent and magmatic volumes of the DSIP. As the new models only give point-wise information at 34 stations, the interpretations are clearly spatially and structurally limited. More work is therefore required to confirm our inferences and most importantly, more and denser data coverage along the Labrador-Baffin passive margins will help tying structural relationships from Canada to Greenland and along the margins. The correlation of magmatic products, HVLC and known pre-existing structures and terranes boundaries in the region supports a model in which inheritance plays a major role in localising extension, breakup and magmatism in the Northwest Atlantic. However, whether a thermal mantle upwelling was present or whether the region even required assistance cannot be determined.\nWe would like to emphasise four regions that could yield particularly useful results from more extensive work: i) better coverage of the Disko Bay region, in particular along the mainland, to trace the potential eastern boundary of the DSIP; ii) the area around station NUUK, which shows evidence for a substantial HVLC thickness, but it is unclear whether it is related to the DSIP. Moreover, greater coverage could give insights into the spatial distribution and origin of the HVLC in this area; iii) SE and central Baffin Island, to investigate the extent of the HVLC and to distinguish whether the HVLC is of orogenic-type or igneous-type; and finally, iv) More work along the Labrador coast in order to fill the gaps between controlled-source and natural-source seismic constraints and get insight into the distribution and origin of HVLC there.\nExample linearised LSQ inversion of station TULEG with 5 (d), 12 (e) and 18 (f) layers.\n\n\n\nCredit authors\nCS was lead author, developed the inverse approach and produced results and figs.\nAP contributed to the interpretation of the results and to the development of the manuscript, with focus on the introductory, geological background, result and discussion sections.\nSJ contributed to the interpretation of the results and to the development of the manuscript, with focus on the introductory, geological background, result and discussion sections.\nSR was involved in the development of the inverse approach, contributed receiver function data and developed the manuscript with focus on the methodological sections and interpretation.\nAll authors were involved in developing the submitted version of the manuscript.\n\n","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFragmentation of rocks occurs during a variety of geological processes, including seismogenic fault rupture (e.g., Aben et al., 2017), gravitational mass movements (e.g., De Blasio and Crosta, 2014), and meteorite impacts (e.g., Kenkmann et al., 2014). In all these events, brittle failure may occur under dynamic, high strain rate conditions. At these conditions, the mechanical properties of rocks (Zhang and Zhao, 2014), the behaviour of individual fractures (Fineberg et al., 1991; Ravi-Chandar and Knauss, 1984a; Sharon and Fineberg, 1999; Zhang et al., 1999), and the interaction between growing fractures (e.g., Ramesh et al., 2015) can be strongly rate-dependent and deviate from quasi-static brittle failure.\nThe results of mechanical experiments demonstrate that rocks behave with a strength that is near constant at low strain rates before increasing markedly beyond a threshold strain rate of ~100\u2013103\u00a0s\u22121 (Aben et al., 2017; Ramesh et al., 2015; Zhang and Zhao, 2014, and refs. therein). A number of analytical and micromechanical models have been developed that demonstrate this increase in strength (Bhat et al., 2012; Hild et al., 2003; Paliwal and Ramesh, 2008). Based on a study that explored one of these micromechanical models (Paliwal and Ramesh, 2008), Kimberley et al. (2013) demonstrated that the behaviour of rocks from quasi-static to high strain rates can be described by a universal scaling relationship:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nc\n\n\n\u03c3\n0\n\n\n=\n1\n+\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n0\n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c3\n\nc\n and \n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n are the compressive strength and strain rate, respectively, and the material parameters, \u03c3\n0 and \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n0\n\n, are the characteristic strength and characteristic strain rate, respectively. The characteristic strength is equivalent to the quasi-static uniaxial compressive strength and the characteristic strain rate corresponds to the strain rate at which strength is double the value of the quasi-static strength.\nThe dependence of rock strength on strain rate is fundamentally linked to the nucleation and growth of fractures. Fractures propagate at a finite velocity: during failure at low rates, the weakest available flaw in a material can initiate a single fracture that can grow fast enough to accommodate the applied loading; at high rates, that single flaw cannot develop a single fracture before other increasingly strong flaws are activated (Aben et al., 2017; Ramesh et al., 2015). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the behaviour of individual fractures may change as a result of high-rate loading by increasing the fracture toughness and producing hierarchical fracture branches (Ravi-Chandar and Knauss, 1984a; Sharon and Fineberg, 1999; Zhang et al., 1999). The consequence of these processes is that rock failure at high strain rates leads to intense fracturing and fragmentation.\nUpper crustal fault zones generally consist of a fault core and a surrounding damage zone. The fault core contains highly comminuted material that accommodates most of the cumulative shear strain while the damage zone consists of fragmented and brecciated rock with little or no shear displacement (Faulkner et al., 2003). Brittle deformation in the damage zone is generated by coseismic transient loading conditions; either by rapid reduction of normal stress (Brune et al., 1993), local strain near fracture tips (Reches and Dewers, 2005), and\/or the propagation of shock waves during supershear rupturing (Doan and Gary, 2009). Coseismic fracturing and fragmentation, the extent and magnitude of which is controlled by the loading rate, may be an important component of the energy budget of rupture events (Barber and Griffith, 2017; Ghaffari et al., 2019; Rockwell et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2005). The most extreme deformation caused by coseismic dynamic fracturing is thought to be expressed in so-called pulverised rocks, which have extremely high fracture densities and low shear strain. These rocks can be found tens to hundreds of meters from their fault core (Dor et al., 2006a; Fondriest et al., 2015; Mitchell et al., 2011; Rempe et al., 2013).\nThe close link between the variation of strength with strain rate and fragmentation behaviour has been demonstrated with a variety of dynamic uniaxial compression experiments (Barber and Griffith, 2017; Doan and Billi, 2011; Doan and Gary, 2009a; Ghaffari et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2011a). Furthermore, fragmentation laws have been proposed that describe the variation of fragment size in an expanding shell as a function of the applied strain rate (Glenn and Chudnovsky, 1986; Grady, 1982; Levy and Molinari, 2010; Zhou et al., 2006a, 2006b); all of these models consistently predict that, at high strain rates, fragment size has an inverse power-law relationship with strain rate with an exponent of 2\/3. This exponent arises as a consequence of the equilibrium conversion of kinetic energy released in fragmentation (\n\nU\nk\n\n\u221d\n\ns\n5\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n2\n\n, where s is the fragment size) to fracture surface energy (U\n\ns\n\u00a0\u221d\u00a0s\n2) (Grady, 1982). Direct comparisons between fragmentation models and the products of compressive failure are problematic because the fragmentation of an expanding shell is a tensile process. However, in general, experimental studies have shown that the fragmentation models overestimate average fragment sizes and\/or do not follow a power law with the expected exponent (Ghaffari et al., 2019; Hogan et al., 2012, 2013; Lankford and Blanchard, 1991; Rae et al., 2020; Wang and Ramesh, 2004). Nevertheless, the combination of experimental and\/or theoretical fragmentation models with field observations of naturally fragmented rock masses provides an important opportunity to determine transient loading conditions during coseismic deformation or other high-strain rate geoprocesses (Rowe and Griffith, 2015).\nIn this study, we aim to investigate the fragmentation behaviour of rocks under dynamic loading, characterising how fragment size and shape vary as functions of strain rate, therefore providing potential diagnostic indicators of transient loading conditions in naturally deformed rocks. To achieve this, we conducted quasi-static and dynamic uniaxial loading experiments on rock materials, determining dynamic rock mechanical properties and performing post-mortem analysis of the generated rock fragments. For this study, we decided to limit our investigation to sedimentary and metamorphic rocks: sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble. These rock types were chosen because, first, pulverisation has been widely reported in association with faults hosted in sandstones (Dor et al., 2006a, 2006b; Key and Schultz, 2011; Peppard et al., 2018) and carbonates (Agosta and Aydin, 2006; Fondriest et al., 2015; Sagy and Korngreen, 2012; Schr\u00f6ckenfuchs et al., 2015), and second, it allowed us to investigate the effect of porosity on fragmentation and dynamic material properties in lithologies with similar mineralogies.\n\n\n2\nMethods\n\n2.1\nMaterial description\nThe sandstone used in this study was quarried by TRACO Deutsche Travertin Werke GmbH at Seeberg near Gotha, Germany, hereafter termed \u2018Seeberger Sandstone\u2019. Quartzite was acquired from Taunus-Quartzit-Werke GmbH & Co., Wehrheim, Germany, hereafter termed \u2018Taunus Quartzite\u2019. Limestone was acquired from Savonni\u00e8res-en-Perthois, Lorraine, France, hereafter termed \u2018Savonni\u00e8res Limestone\u201d. Marble was acquired from the Amso International Company, Tuscany, Italy, hereafter termed \u2018Carrara Marble\u2019.\nThe Seeberger Sandstone is composed of 89% quartz, ~10% phyllosilicates (mostly clay minerals and subordinate micas), and minor accessory minerals (Ebert et al., 2014). Grain sizes range between ~50\u2013150\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 1\n). Macroscopically, weakly developed bedding and Liesegang banding can be observed, but do not cause significant mechanical anisotropy. The bulk density and porosity of the Seeberger Sandstone was determined by He-pycnometry to be 2130\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123 and 20.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8% respectively. The Taunus Quartzite is composed of 91% quartz, ~8% phyllosilicates, and minor accessory minerals (Ebert et al., 2014). Grain sizes range from ~100\u2013400\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 1). The quartzite contains minor joints with an approximate spacing of 10\u00a0cm, the joints are commonly mineralized with chlorite. The bulk density and porosity of the Taunus Quartzite was determined by He-pycnometry to be 2645\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123 and 0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1% respectively. The Savonni\u00e8res Limestone is an oolitic grainstone with partial sparitic cement. Vacuolar ooids are common and the rock contains occasional shell fragments. Mineralogically, the rock is composed of close to 100% calcite. The ooids typically range in size from 400 to 750\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 1). The bulk density and porosity of the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone was determined by He-pycnometry to be 1881\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123 and 31.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1% respectively. The Carrara Marble is composed of 98% calcite, and minor quantities of quartz, mica, dolomite, epidote, and pyrite (Pieri et al., 2001). Grain sizes range from 200 to 400\u00a0\u03bcm. Calcite grains are commonly twinned (Fig. 1). In hand specimen, the marble is massive and homogeneous. The bulk density and porosity of the Carrara Marble was determined by He-pycnometry to be 2711\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123 and 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0% respectively.\nThe samples used for rock deformation experiments were cored from blocks of each lithology (Fig. 1a). Typical samples were 39.0\u201341.0\u00a0mm in diameter, however cores of the Taunus Quartzite were\u00a0~\u00a035.0\u00a0mm in diameter for a number of reasons: firstly, the Taunus Quartzite is very strong, narrower diameter cores made it easier to achieve failure in split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments. Secondly, the joints within the Taunus Quartzite made drilling challenging, reducing core diameter made it easier to produce appropriate samples. Additionally, cores of the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone were\u00a0~\u00a054\u00a0mm in diameter for quasi-static uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) testing due to the material's extreme weakness; larger diameter samples ensured that a larger force could be applied to the samples and that a greater amount of data could be recorded in the elastic regime. The lengths of the samples were maintained such that samples had 2:1 aspect ratios (length-to-diameter ratio) for quasi-static UCS testing (Hawkes and Mellor, 1970; Hawkins, 1998) and had ~1:1 aspect ratios for SHPB experiments (Zhang and Zhao, 2014; Zhou et al., 2011). After drilling, all samples were ground to produce plane-parallel faces and then dried in an oven at 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. In total, 90 experiments were conducted in this study. 27 and 20 experiments were carried out on the Seeberger Sandstone and Taunus Quartzite, respectively. 18 and 25 experiments were carried out on the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone and Carrara Marble, respectively. Sample dimensions for each experiment are listed in the Supplementary Online Material.\n\n\n2.2\nExperimental rock deformation\n\n2.2.1\nQuasi-static testing\nUniaxial compression experiments under quasi-static conditions were performed with a servo-controlled Form+Test Alpha 2\u20133000\u00a0S hydraulic press in the Department of Geology at the University of Freiburg. Displacement gauges were used to measure the longitudinal and transverse strains in the samples. From these strains, the elastic (Young's) modulus and Poisson's ratio of the samples were determined. Experiments were run under constant loading-rate conditions, which, within the elastic loading regime leads to constant strain rates. Experiments were conducted at strain rates between 5.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 and 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0s\u22121. Between 3 and 8 quasi-static experiments were carried out for each lithology.\n\n\n2.2.2\nDynamic testing\nUniaxial compression experiments under dynamic conditions were performed with a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) in the Department of Geology at the University of Freiburg. SHPBs are comprised of three bars: striker, incident, and transmission. The sample is positioned between and in contact with the incident and transmission bars. The striker bar is accelerated towards the front-end of the incident bar, generating a stress wave that propagates towards the sample and transmission bar. The amplitude of the stress wave is low enough not to induce permanent deformation in the bars but can be high enough to induce failure in the sample material. Strain gauges are attached to the incident and transmission bars such that the stress and strain history of the sample can be determined (see Supplementary Material). Here, we determine the strain rate for a given experiment by taking the average strain rate during loading with one standard deviation errors (see Supplementary Material). Strain rates in failed specimens during SHPB experiments were between 35.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 and 345.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a083.2\u00a0s\u22121. A detailed description of the methodology and processing of SHPB data, including strain rate and strength determination, is provided in the Supplementary Material and provided in a GitHub Repository. General descriptions of the methodology of SHPBs can be found by Aben et al. (2017); Chen and Song (2010); Xia and Yao (2015); Zhang and Zhao (2014); Zhou et al. (2011); and Zwiessler et al. (2017). Samples were recovered from the SHPB by collection in a secure box lined with a polyethylene bag.\n\n\n\n2.3\nFragment analysis\n\n2.3.1\nSize\nOn average, we were able to recover 88.2% of the mass of each sample from the SHPB experiments, recovery was generally poorer in the sandstone and limestone, with average recoveries of 83.4% and 84.4% respectively, while 95.5% and 88.6% recoveries were achieved with the quartzite and marble respectively (see GitHub repository for further details). Fragment size distributions were obtained by sieving the fragmented rock masses resulting from the experiments. Each sample of the same lithology were passed through identical sieve stacks, although sieve stacks were varied between lithology. Each sieve stack had at least 7 sieves ranging from 16\u00a0mm to 0.125\u00a0mm square apertures. Sieving was carried out dry and shaking was carried out by hand for a duration of one minute per sample.\nA consequence of using sieving to determine fragment size distributions is that it results in mass-size distributions, as opposed to number-size distributions. A variety of statistical distributions can be used to fit fragment size distributions from failure events (see Grady, 2010). Here, we have chosen to use cumulative Weibull distributions:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nM\n\ns\n\n\n\nM\nT\n\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\ns\n\/\n\u03bb\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere M(s) is the cumulative mass of fragments that have a size less than s; M\n\nT\n is the total sample mass; and \u03bb and k are the Weibull distribution parameters. There is no theoretical basis for our usage of the Weibull distribution which we chose only for its simplicity, general usage (Grady, 2009), and similarity to the shape of our data. We note that other distributions could have been used to fit our fragment size data, e.g., Rayleigh (Levy and Molinari, 2010), log-normal (Wang and Ramesh, 2004), or generalized extreme value (Hogan et al., 2012). Non-linear least squares fitting was used to determine the Weibull distribution parameters. The median of a Weibull distribution, \n\ns\n\u00af\n\n, can be calculated as:\n\n(3)\n\n\ns\n\u00af\n\n=\n\u03bb\n\nln\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\/\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the quartzite, limestone, and marble samples, no more than 26% and on average 2%, 8%, and 16% respectively of the total mass of the samples passed the finest sieve. Thus, for these lithologies, the median fragment size is an interpolated value within the distribution. However, the sandstone produced substantially finer fragments such that on average 42% of the total mass of the samples passed the finest sieve. In 5 sandstone samples, the mass percentage passing through the finest sieve exceeded 50%, and therefore the calculated median fragment size is extrapolated below the size of the finest sieve size. We were unable to extend these distributions to finer fragment sizes due to unreliability of dry sieving through finer sieves. Additionally, we attempted to use laser diffraction granulometry (Malvern MasterSizer 3000) on the fine fragments but were unable to achieve consistent overlap between sieving and laser diffraction analyses and between different runs of the laser diffraction granulometer on the same sample to extend the fragment size distributions to smaller fragment size. Our problems of integrating fragment size distributions across different methodologies are similar to those reported by Rockwell et al. (2009) on pulverised rocks from the San Andreas and Garlock faults in southern California.\n\n\n2.3.2\nShape\nThe shapes of fragments generated by the experiments were determined by image analysis. We focussed on two size fractions: fragments larger than 2\u00a0mm, and fragments from 0.5 to 2\u00a0mm in size. These size fractions had to be imaged separately and followed different image processing procedures for a variety of practical reasons (for details, see Supplementary Material). For the fragments larger than 2\u00a0mm, all fragments in the sample were analysed. The total number of fragments in each of these distributions ranged from 122 to 629, depending on sample. For the fragments between 0.5 and 2\u00a0mm, subsampling was required and four images, each of different subsamples, were acquired. After ensuring consistency between the distributions of each subsample, the fragment shape data from all four images were combined into a single distribution. The total number of fragments in each of these distributions ranged from 1980 to 6660, depending on sample (for details, see Supplementary Material and Supplementary Online Material). Images were processed using the Fiji software package (Schindelin et al., 2012; see Supplementary Material) and fragment shape parameters were determined for each fragment. Here, we have considered two shape factors, circularity, C, and axial ratio, AR (Heilbronner and Barrett, 2014):\n\n(4)\n\nC\n=\n4\n\u03c0\n\n\nA\n\nP\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\nAR\n=\n\nw\nl\n\n\n\nwhere A is the area of the fragment, P is the perimeter of the fragment, w is the minor axis length of the best-fitting ellipse, and l is the major axis length of the best-fitting ellipse. C has a value of 1 for a perfect circle and approaches 0 as the shape's perimeter increases relative to its area. AR has a value of 1 for a perfectly equant shape, i.e. any regular polyhedra, and approaches 0 as the shape becomes increasingly elongate.\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nMechanical data\nIn general, results of mechanical testing demonstrate dynamic strength increase under uniaxial compression at large strain rates. The quasi-static and dynamic uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) values can be individually fitted to the scaling relationship of Kimberley et al. (2013) (Eq. 1) by non-linear least squares fitting (Fig. 2\n). The characteristic stress (i.e. the UCS) of the sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble were determined to be 55.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6, 243.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.6, 18.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5, and 97.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0MPa respectively (Table 1\n). The characteristic strain rates of the sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble are 322\u00a0\u00b1\u00a092, 280\u00a0\u00b1\u00a092, 241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a078, and 144\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033\u00a0s\u22121, respectively (Table 1).\n\n\n3.2\nFragment size distributions\nFragment size distributions and their fitted Weibull distributions for the sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble are shown on Fig. 3a-d. All distributions are characterised by increasing fractions of fine-grained material at larger strain rates. Weibull distributions produce very good fits to the fragment size distributions of the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone, while providing good fits to the Seeberger Sandstone and Taunus Quartzite distributions. The Carrara Marble distributions are, in general, less well fitted by Weibull distributions, however, the median values of those fitted distributions tend to closely match the linearly interpolated 50th percentile value of the distribution and therefore, we continued to use the Weibull distribution fits to determine the average grain size of each distribution. Average fragment sizes for each lithology decrease with increasing strain rate (Fig. 4\n). Each lithology follows an inverse power law where the exponents for the sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble are 2.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63, 1.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36, 0.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23, and 1.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41, respectively.\n\n\n3.3\nFragment shape distributions\nOverall, the shape distributions of fragments do not vary as functions of strain rate or with lithology (Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). For the fragments larger than 2\u00a0mm and across all lithologies, the average circularity is 0.733\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.087 and the average axial ratio is 0.627\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.146 (Table 2\n). No individual distribution, regardless of strain rate or lithology, is an outlier of these average values. For the fragments that range between 0.5 and 2\u00a0mm and across all lithologies, the average circularity is 0.598\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.180 and the average axial ratio is 0.642\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.152 (Table 2). The average circularity of these smaller fragments is less than the average circularity of the larger fragments while axial ratios remain similar, additionally the standard deviations of the distributions of these finer fragments is generally larger. We largely attribute these variations to differences in method between larger and smaller fragments (see Supplementary Material). However, we observe similar trends in the fragment shape distributions from sample to sample between the different fragment size fractions (Figs. 5 and 6), demonstrating the overall robustness of the fragment shape analysis.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nMechanical properties\n\n4.1.1\nStrength\nThe quasi-static strengths of the Seeberger Sandstone, Taunus Quartzite, Savonni\u00e8res Limestone, and Carrara Marble determined in this study are generally consistent with previous measurements of the same lithologies (Table 3\n). The only study of the same lithologies where measured strength values differ by more than 2\u03c3 uncertainties is that of Millon et al. (2016); we note that Millon et al. used larger samples with greater aspect ratios (3:1) than our samples, which may be responsible for lower values of UCS (Hawkes and Mellor, 1970; Hawkins, 1998).\n\n\n4.1.2\nCharacteristic strain rate\nCharacteristic strain rates for rate dependency, whether defined strictly according to the scaling relationship of Kimberley et al. (2013) or more generally as the strain rate for the transition between quasi-static and dynamic deformation, are less widely reported than strength values. Dynamic strength data for the Seeberger Sandstone has been reported by Millon et al. (2016) and Zwiessler et al. (2017). Millon et al. (2016) did not directly report a characteristic rate but instead demonstrated dynamic increase factors (DIFs) between 3.6 and 5.3 at strain rates between 275 and 350\u00a0s\u22121; ultimately suggesting a characteristic strain rate (where at that rate, DIF is 2) that is less than 275\u00a0s\u22121 but greater than ~101\u00a0s\u22121. Zwiessler et al. (2017), on the other hand state the characteristic rate of the Seeberger Sandstone to be 170\u00a0s\u22121. Both of these studies appear to demonstrate lower values of characteristic strain rate than reported here, however we note that our results are based on a considerably larger data set and that our results provide quantified, and quite large, statistical uncertainties. To our knowledge, dynamic strength properties of the Taunus Quartzite have never been reported. Millon et al. (2016) also investigated the dynamic strength of the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone. They found DIFs of 4.3\u20134.9 over strain rates from 345 to 515\u00a0s\u22121; suggesting a characteristic strain rate less than 345 but greater than ~101\u00a0s\u22121. Again, this is lower than the value of the characteristic rate reported in this study, however again, our study is based on a larger data set, and provides more constraint on the value of the characteristic strain rate. Furthermore, we note that our study is consistent with the results of Millon et al. (2016) in that the characteristic rates of both the Seeberger Sandstone and Savonni\u00e8res Limestone are similar, being within uncertainties of each other. Finally, the characteristic strain rate of the Carrara Marble has been reported by Zwiessler et al. (2017) as 65\u00a0s\u22121. Additionally, Zou and Wong (2016) reported DIFs between 4.0 and 7.0 at strain rates between 100 and 600\u00a0s\u22121, suggesting a characteristic strain rate between 10 and 100\u00a0s\u22121. Our value for the characteristic strain rate of the Carrara Marble is greater than both Zwiessler et al. (2017) and Zou and Wong (2016) suggest, however, our results are consistent with the results of Zwiessler et al. (2017) in that the characteristic rate of the Carrara Marble is significantly less than the characteristic rate of the Seeberger Sandstone. Additionally, in a study on the dynamic deformation of the Carrara Marble, Doan and Billi (2011) found a transition from splitting to pulverisation at peak strain rates of ~100\u00a0s\u22121. However, their results show a curious lack of systematic increase in strength between peak rates of ~50\u2013250\u00a0s\u22121.\nOther studies of dynamic strength in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are generally consistent with the results of our study. Green et al. (1972) conducted one of the earliest studies on the dynamic strength properties of rocks and found a transition to dynamic behaviour in Solnhofen Limestone at ~102\u00a0s\u22121. Howe et al. (1974) found dynamic strength increases in the anisotropic Yule Marble at rates >10\u00a0s\u22121. In a study on the Berea Sandstone and Indiana Limestone, Blanton (1981) demonstrated a lack of dynamic strength effects at strain rates up to 10\u00a0s\u22121. On the same limestone, Frew et al. (2001) found DIFs of up to 1.7 at rates of ~100\u00a0s\u22121. Rosakis (1999) reported dynamic strength properties of Dionysus-Pentalicon Marble (see Bhat et al., 2012), demonstrating DIFs of 2 at ~400\u00a0s\u22121. In sandstones, Alam et al. (2015) found DIFs up to ~1.8 at strain rates up to ~1\u00a0s\u22121 in an investigation of the Kota Sandstone while Liu et al. (2012) conducted experiments on Qinling Sandstone at rates between 50 and 100\u00a0s\u22121 and found DIFs between 1.6 and 3.2, suggesting a characteristic strain rate of ~60\u00a0s\u22121. Most recently, Fondriest et al. (2017) investigated the Mendola Dolostone and found the onset of pulverisation at rates of ~120\u00a0s\u22121, albeit with limited dynamic strength increase between 40 and 300\u00a0s\u22121.\nOur results show that the characteristic strain rates of the Seeberger Sandstone, Taunus Quartzite, and Savonni\u00e8res Limestone, with values of 322\u00a0\u00b1\u00a092, 280\u00a0\u00b1\u00a092, and 241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a078\u00a0s\u22121 respectively, are all within uncertainty of each other (Table 1). In a previous study, we reported the characteristic strain rates of felsic crystalline rocks; a granite and a transversely isotropic gneiss (Rae et al., 2020), to be within uncertainty of each other (and independent of anisotropy) with an average value of 229\u00a0\u00b1\u00a081\u00a0s\u22121, remarkably similar to the characteristic rates of the Seeberger Sandstone, Taunus Quartzite, and Savonni\u00e8res Limestone. This suggests that lithological variability of characteristic strain rate is minor or even negligible for rocky materials, particularly given the large uncertainties that arise as a result of inter-sample variability, in addition to the challenges of defining a precise and accurate representative strain rate for SHPB, and other dynamic mechanical testing, techniques (Aben et al., 2017; Ramesh et al., 2015; Supplementary Material).\nThe Carrara Marble, with a characteristic rate of 144\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033, is the only lithology we have investigated to have a significantly different value of characteristic strain rate. By the consideration of characteristic length and time scales, Kimberley et al. (2013) suggested that the characteristic strain rate in their scaling relationship can be related to mechanical and microstructural properties of the material:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n0\n\n\u221d\n\n\nv\np\n\n\ns\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\nK\nIC\n\nE\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n1\n4\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nv\n\n\n\np\n\n is the p-wave speed, \n\ns\n\u00af\n\n is the average flaw size, \nK\n\n\n\nIC\n\n is the mode-I fracture toughness, \nE\n is the elastic modulus, and \n\u03b7\n is the flaw density. By this consideration, the Carrara Marble must either possess comparatively low values of \nv\n\n\n\np\n\n, \nK\n\n\n\nIC\n\n, or \n\u03b7\n, or large values of \n\ns\n\u00af\n\n or \nE\n. Based on the elastic properties determined in this study, the wave speed of the Carrara Marble is significantly greater than that of the other lithologies; while the elastic modulus, though large, is comparatively similar to the other non-porous lithology, i.e., the Taunus Quartzite. The mode-I fracture toughness of the Carrara Marble has been measured by Atkinson (1979) and Meredith et al. (1984) as 0.64 and 0.87\u00a0MPa\u00a0m\n1\/2, respectively. Mode-I fracture toughnesses for the other lithologies in this study have not been determined, however in comparison to literature values for sandstones, quartzites, and limestones generally (\nTable 4\n\n), the fracture toughness of the Carrara Marble is low, though not by a large enough factor to fully account for the reduced characteristic strain rate. The microstructural properties of flaw size and flaw density are extremely challenging to measure within a real rock (Housen and Holsapple, 1999), and therefore, it may be the case that the Carrara Marble simply has an unusual distribution of flaws to explain the discrepancy in characteristic strain rate. Nevertheless, the scaling relationship of Kimberley et al. (2013) assumes that the mode-I fracture toughness is a constant value; but fracture toughness is known to increase as a function of strain rate (Bhat et al., 2012; Ravi-Chandar and Knauss, 1984a; Zhang and Zhao, 2014). Consequently, the behaviour of the Carrara Marble may be a consequence of a decreased sensitivity of fracture toughness with strain rate in comparison to other rocks.\n\n\n\n4.2\nFragment characteristics\n\n4.2.1\nFragment size \u2013 an empirical compressive fragmentation relationship\nOur results demonstrate the general relationship that increasing strain rate results in finer fragmentation under uniaxial compression. This observation is in agreement with a large number of previous studies (e.g., Barber and Griffith, 2017; Doan and Billi, 2011; Doan and d'Hour, 2012; Doan and Gary, 2009; Fondriest et al., 2017; Ghaffari et al., 2019; Hogan et al., 2012, 2016; Li et al., 2018; Millon et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2011). Specific comparison of our fragmentation results with many of these studies is challenging for a variety of reasons. Firstly, fragment size distributions can be characterised by either mass or by number, converting number-size to mass-size distributions and vice versa is non-trivial. Secondly, even with the same type of distribution, its shape will depend on the method used to obtain that distribution (e.g., sieving, sedimentation, laser diffraction). Finally, there is no single common method of determining the \u201ccharacteristic\u201d size of a fragment size distribution. We arbitrarily chose to use the median of the fragment mass-size distribution (also known as D50) as the \u201ccharacteristic\u201d size of each distribution.\nDespite these complexities, we find that the fragmentation behaviour of the Taunus Quartzite is very similar to the behaviour of felsic crystalline rocks (Rae et al., 2020), producing average fragment sizes of 40\u20131\u00a0mm at strain rates of 30\u2013300\u00a0s\u22121 (Fig. 4). Somewhat expectedly, the Seeberger Sandstone produces considerably finer fragments at equivalent strain rates, which we attribute to the relative ease of fracturing and separating grains in a porous material. By comparison, the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone produces coarser fragments than the Seeberger Sandstone but finer fragments than the Taunus Quartzite and other non-porous crystalline rocks (Fig. 4). We suggest that this may be a consequence of the relative grain sizes of the lithologies; the texture of the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone is dominated by 0.5\u20131\u00a0mm diameter ooids, while the Seeberger Sandstone has an average grain size of ~0.1\u00a0mm. Our results on the fragmentation of Seeberger Sandstone and Savonni\u00e8res Limestone can be compared to the results of Millon et al. (2016) who report fragment size distributions with D50 values from 19.9\u20131.6\u00a0mm at strain rates between 20 and 345\u00a0s\u22121 respectively for the Seeberger Sandstone, and D50 values between 21.4 and 0.46\u00a0mm at strain rates between 20 and 515\u00a0s\u22121 respectively for the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone. These fragment sizes are generally consistent with the results of our study except for the average fragment size of the Seeberger Sandstone at large strain rates where we produced considerably finer fragments. In a study of the dynamic failure properties of the Carrara Marble, Doan and Billi (2011) found that pulverisation of marble was \u201ceasier\u201d than pulverisation in granite. Our study is consistent with this observation, where, at the same strain rate, the Carrara Marble produces fragments at least one order of magnitude finer than the fragmentation of felsic crystalline rocks reported by Rae et al. (2020) and the quartzite of this study. The Carrara Marble even produces finer fragments than the Savonni\u00e8res Limestone, which may be a consequence of its finer grain size.\nA number of models have been proposed to determine average fragment size as a function of strain rate (Glenn and Chudnovsky, 1986; Grady, 1982; Levy and Molinari, 2010; Zhou et al., 2006a, 2006b). These models are principally concerned with tensile fragmentation of an expanding shell. While each model has important differences, all models predict that in the dynamic regime, fragment size is an inverse power law function of strain rate with an exponent of 2\/3, a value that arises as a consequence of the assumption of equilibrium conversion of the kinetic energy released in fragmentation to fracture surface energy (Grady, 1982). The energy-based fragmentation models of Grady (1982) and Glenn and Chudnovsky (1986) do not explicitly address the issue of the statistical distribution of fragment sizes (Grady, 2007), while more recent dynamic models (Levy and Molinari, 2010; Zhou et al., 2006a, 2006b) have used the average of number-size distributions. Deviations from an exponent of 2\/3 may reflect either additional energy sources, such as elastic strain energy (e.g. Glenn and Chudnovsky, 1986), or additional energy sinks, such as frictional heating, remnant kinetic energy, or plastic work. All of the rocks in this study demonstrate an inverse power law relation between median fragment size (determined from mass-size distributions) under uniaxial compressive failure and strain rate (Fig. 4). The exponents of those power-laws vary, depending on lithology, between 0.65 +\/\u2212 0.23 and 2.90 +\/\u2212 0.63 (Table 1). A direct comparison between these exponents and the exponents of the fragmentation models is challenging due to the complexity of converting mass-size and number-size distributions. Ghaffari et al. (2019) also reported an inverse power-law relationship between fragment size (from number-size distributions) and strain rate in uniaxial compression in Westerly Granite, however their exponent of 0.42 is considerably lower than a value of 2\/3, unlike our results which produced exponents that were generally greater.\nTensile failure, as modelled in the expanding shell problem, is fundamentally different from compressive failure (Jaeger et al., 2007). The creation, activation, and growth of internal defects that occurs during compressive failure can make a material quite different from its pristine condition (Hogan et al., 2016), and large amounts of strain energy can be stored in brittle materials in compression which, when released, can generate very fine fragments (Ramesh et al., 2015). Consequently, compressive fragmentation cannot be directly compared to tensile fragmentation models. Hogan et al. (2016) and Ramesh et al. (2015) have developed a method to convert compressive strain rates to equivalent tensile strain rates such that compressive failure could be compared to tensile fragmentation models. In a previous study (Rae et al., 2020), we found that applying this conversion method caused the fragment relationships of multiple lithologies to collapse onto a single power-law relationship, however, the exponent of that relationship remained significantly different from the expected exponent of 2\/3. The results presented here could be analysed with the same method to produce a similar result; however, we have decided to take a more phenomenological approach and derive a simple empirical relationship between strain rate and fragment size. To achieve this, we first normalise the compressive strain rate by the characteristic strain rate for each lithology. Then we attempted to find a normalisation factor for the average fragment size that caused the results to collapse onto a single power law. Noting that the method of Hogan et al. (2016) and Ramesh et al. (2015) achieved the collapse of the data to a single power-law, we decided to attempt a normalisation factor akin to the characteristic length used in their method. That characteristic length, s\n\n0\n, is determined by considering the characteristic time, t\n\n0\n, for the growth of a cohesive crack under external loading and the sound velocity of the material (Camacho and Ortiz, 1996; Drugan, 2001):\n\n(7)\n\n\ns\n0\n\n=\n\nv\np\n\n\n\nt\n0\n\n=\n\n\n\nK\nIC\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\nt\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c3\n\nt\n is the tensile strength of the material. Noting that the tensile strength of rocks is typically some constant fraction of the compressive strength (e.g., Hogan et al., 2016), we reduce the characteristic length scale to remove the constant terms, i.e.:\n\n(8)\n\n\ns\n0\n\n=\n\n\n\nK\nIC\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n0\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile \nK\n\n\n\nIC\n\n values for the Carrara Marble have been determined experimentally (Atkinson, 1979; Meredith et al., 1984), \nK\n\n\n\nIC\n\n is unknown for the other lithologies. Instead, we take the average value of \nK\n\n\n\nIC\n\n from similar lithologies and include the effect of considerably larger uncertainties (Table 4).\nNormalisation of the strain rates and fragment sizes for all the experiments in this study and the experimental results of Rae et al. (2020) are shown on Fig. 7\n. We notice that this normalisation results in the collapse of all non-porous lithologies to a single inverse power-law relation, and the porous lithologies (Seeberger Sandstone, \u03c6\u00a0=\u00a020.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8%; Savonni\u00e8res Limestone, \u03c6\u00a0=\u00a031.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1%) to a parallel trending inverse power-law. The general form of this power law is expressed as:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\ns\n\u00af\n\n\ns\n0\n\n\n=\nk\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n0\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe fit the data for non-porous and porous rocks using non-linear least squares fitting in log-log space to determine that, for non-porous rocks, the exponent, \u03bc, is 1.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14, and the constant k is \n\n12.2\n\u22121.67\n+1.93\n\n. The power law for porous rocks has an exponent, \u03bc, of 1.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40, and a constant, k, of \n\n0.13\n\u22120.04\n+0.07\n\n (Table 5\n). The exponents, \u03bc, for non-porous and porous rocks are within 1\u03c3 uncertainty of each other; we emphasise that this exponent relates the strain rate to the median fragment size from mass-size distributions, the median from number-size distributions may scale differently. The constants, k, for the non-porous and porous relationships are significantly different, indicating that the constant is likely to be a function of porosity, or some mechanical or microstructural property closely related to porosity (e.g., flaw density, flaw size, etc.). However, in the absence of a wider variety of tested porous rocks, we are unable to speculate further on the nature of the dependency of k on porosity. Our relationship for porous rocks is only appropriate for porosities between ~20\u201330%; less porous rocks are likely to follow trends with intermediate values of k.\n\n\n4.2.2\nFragment shapes\nOur results demonstrate that fragment shape is independent of both strain rate and lithology (Figs. 5 and 6). For all of the lithologies in this study, average fragment circularity and axial ratios at all strain rates are both ~0.6. Our results therefore suggest that fragment shape cannot be used as a fingerprint for the conditions at which deformation and, more specifically, fragmentation occurred. Nevertheless, we note that our experiments were only conducted under uniaxial compression; it remains to be seen whether fragment shape in dynamic failure is dependent on the state of stress, whether simply confined or under truly triaxial conditions.\nTo understand why fragment shape may be independent of strain rate during dynamic fragmentation, we consider the geometric fragmentation of a unit area\/volume. At low strain rates, an area\/volume will be fragmented by a small number of fractures, producing a small number of large fragments. At high strain rates, the area\/volume will be fragmented by a large number of fractures, producing a large number of small fragments. The exact distribution of fragment sizes is fundamentally linked to the method by which fractures are constructed (Grady and Kipp, 1985). Here, we implement a variety of construction algorithms to randomly fragment a two-dimensional area with the aim of seeing how fragment shape changes as a function of the number of fractures (i.e. strain rate). We chose three geometric fragmentation construction algorithms as described by Grady and Kipp (1985): Random Lines, Random Line Segments, and Voronoi Segmentation.\nThe Random Lines algorithm is the simplest of the three. Here, a specified number of randomly distributed points are placed within a unit area. Each point is then assigned a random orientation (between 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0), and a fracture (straight line) is extended from that point such that it extends from one edge of the unit area to another, passing through the point at the assigned orientation. This process is conducted for all points simultaneously. The Random Line Segments algorithm has several similarities to the Random Lines algorithm but is more complex, and realistic. Here, each fracture is added sequentially with the condition that the fracture must terminate against any pre-existing fracture. Voronoi segmentation is conceptually rather different to the previous algorithms but also produces random fragmentation of a unit area. Here, a specified number of random points (\u201cseeds\u201d) are chosen, and the unit area is divided into segments which contain all of the locations closest to a single seed. For each algorithm, 10 images were generated, each with varying numbers of lines or seeds. Those images were then analysed to characterise the shapes (circularity, C, and axial ratio, AR; Eqs. \n4 and 5\n) of the fragments, excluding those at the edge of the unit area, as a function of the number of lines\/seeds.\nWith the Random Lines algorithm, we find that axial ratio is constant as a function of the number of lines while circularity increases (Fig. 8a). With the Random Line Segments and Voronoi algorithms, we found no variation of either circularity or axial ratio with increasing number of lines\/seeds (Fig. 8b and c). Of the three algorithms, Voronoi segmentation achieves the closest match to our experimental results with average circularities of ~0.7 and average axial ratios of ~0.6. We emphasise though, that none of the implemented algorithms are particularly representative of the real process of dynamic fragmentation as they ignore all of the physical and dynamic processes of fracture nucleation and growth. Nevertheless, they demonstrate that uniform fragment shapes as a function of strain rate is a consequence of fragmentation as a stochastic process where the growth of fractures is limited by the presence of other growing fractures. A further implication of our results is that the behaviour of fractures did not change over the conditions explored in our study, i.e. uniaxial compression at rates between ~30 and 300\u00a0s\u22121. Experimental studies have shown that fractures, particularly mode-I fractures, in the dynamic regime may bifurcate or branch under increasing loading rates (Ravi-Chandar and Knauss, 1984b; Zhang and Zhao, 2014; Zhang et al., 1999), this would be expected to lead to the production of more elongate and less circular fragments as a function of increasing rate. However, our results show no variation of fragment shape in common with the simplified geometric models of fragmentation where each fracture behaves the same, regardless of the \u201cstrain rate\u201d.\n\n\n\n4.3\nApplication to naturally fragmented rocks\nFractured, fragmented, and pulverised rocks commonly occur adjacent to tectonic faults, within landslide deposits, and within impact craters. The results of this study have the potential to be used to constrain loading conditions during deformation events associated with these rocks.\nFragmented and pulverised rocks are most commonly studied in association with tectonic faults. Pulverised rocks have been characterised from a variety of large strike-slip faults; e.g. San Andreas (Rempe et al., 2013; Rockwell et al., 2009; Wechsler et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2005), Garlock (Rockwell et al., 2009), Atakama (Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009), Arima-Takatsuki (Mitchell et al., 2011), Salzach\u2013Ennstal\u2013Mariazell\u2013Puchberg (SEMP; Schr\u00f6ckenfuchs et al., 2015), Foiana (Fondriest et al., 2015). In general, fragment size and fracture spacing in the damage zone of faults increase with distance from the fault core, nevertheless, individual faults and fault segments have varying minimum fragment sizes. At Tejon Pass on the San Andreas Fault, fragment sizes within 10\u00a0m of the fault core are ~25\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm, while on the nearby Garlock, fragment sizes are ~75\u2013150\u00a0\u03bcm (Rockwell et al., 2009). Further along the San Andreas Fault, in the vicinity of Littlerock, average fragment sizes in a drill core ~80\u00a0m from the fault core are typically 100\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm (Wechsler et al., 2011). In contrast, average fragment sizes in the most heavily pulverised fault rocks on the SEMP and Foiana faults are ~1\u201330\u00a0mm (Fondriest et al., 2015; Schr\u00f6ckenfuchs et al., 2015).\nFragment size analysis of rock avalanche deposits shows considerable spatial variability within deposits (Dufresne and Dunning, 2017; Dunning and Armitage, 2011); nevertheless many deposits have generally been characterised as possessing inverse grading (e.g., Crosta et al., 2007). In the Val Pola rock avalanche deposits, rock fragments at the surface are ~2\u20135\u00a0m on average while at depths of ~50\u00a0m within the deposit, median fragment sizes decrease by a factor\u00a0~\u00a01000 (i.e. ~2\u20135\u00a0mm). Furthermore, fragment size analysis of the Tschirgant and Flims rock avalanche deposits show median fragment sizes between ~1 and\u00a0~\u00a010\u00a0mm in \u201cfragmented facies\u201d (Dufresne and Dunning, 2017).\nThe empirical scaling relationship presented in this study can be directly applied to these results from fault rocks and rock avalanche deposits. If we assume that the affected rocks are non-porous, have a quasi-static uniaxial compressive strength of 100\u00a0MPa, mode-I fracture toughness of 1\u00a0MPa\u00a0m-1\/2, and characteristic strain rate of 250\u00a0s\u22121; then fragment sizes of 1\u00a0\u03bcm correspond to strain rates of ~9.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0s\u22121, 1\u00a0mm corresponds to 2.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0102\u00a0s\u22121, and 1\u00a0m corresponds to 7.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0s\u22121. Overall, this suggests that strain rates during rupture events on pulverising faults reach values of at least ~102\u2013103\u00a0s\u22121 while strain rates during rock avalanches reach strain rates of ~101\u2013102\u00a0s\u22121. For earthquake rupture, these strain rates are broadly consistent with analytical models of strain rates during dynamic rupture (Doan and Gary, 2009; Reches and Dewers, 2005).\nDespite the apparent consistency between analytical models of rock deformation and the predicted strain rates from use of the fragment scaling relationship of this study with natural samples, several effects that may have significant consequences have not been considered: the role of confining stresses (and truly triaxial stresses), the effect of pore-fluid pressures, and the effect of repeated failure. Observations indicate that pulverisation in fault rocks ceases beyond 3\u20134\u00a0km depth (Dor et al., 2006b) and experimental results corroborate that confining pressures inhibit the fragmentation of rocks at high strain rates (Liu et al., 2019; Liu and Zhao, 2021; Yuan et al., 2011). Furthermore, it remains to be seen how truly triaxial stress states that would be more representative natural stress states may affect the dynamic behaviour of rocks. An additional concern in the scaling of fragment sizes from porous rocks is the effect of pore fluids and rheologically distinct interstitial material (e.g., Peppard et al., 2018). Finally, the experiments in this study were conducted on intact samples, it is unclear how the fragmentation resulting from a single high-rate deformation event can be differentiated from the effect of repeated moderate rate events (e.g., Aben et al., 2016a).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, we have shown that the characteristic strain rates for rate-dependent strength and brittle behaviour under uniaxial compressive loading in sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble ranges between ~144\u2013322\u00a0s\u22121. The degree of fragmentation increases with strain rate over the full range of dynamic rates investigated (~30\u2013350\u00a0s\u22121). Our results demonstrate that compressive fragmentation cannot be described by tensile fragmentation models, and instead we describe an empirical fragmentation relationship for uniaxial compression that describes average fragment size as a function of strain rate. This relation has the form of an inverse power-law with an exponent of 1.93 +\/\u2212 0.14 and a constant that varies with porosity, or some material property correlated with porosity. The applicability of this relation at strain rates at greater or lesser strain rates remains to be seen. The results of our study also demonstrate that fragment shape during dynamic failure is independent of strain rate and lithology, at least for uniaxial compression and the homogeneous lithologies investigated here.\nThe clear implication of this study is that fragment size may be used as a diagnostic indicator of the strain rate at failure while fragment shape cannot be used. Nevertheless, we recommend cautious use of our empirical relationship between strain rate and fragment size. Confinement or truly triaxial stress states during fragmentation may cause significant changes to the process of dynamic fragmentation (Liu et al., 2019; Liu and Zhao, 2021; Yuan et al., 2011) and the fragmentation relation described here. Furthermore, our experiments were conducted on intact rocks, it remains unclear how fragments generated by repeated low-rate events (Aben et al., 2016b) can be differentiated from single high-rate events.\n\n\nAcknowledgments and data availability\nThe authors wish to acknowledge Herbert Ickler and Gordon Mette for preparation of samples.

Repeated deformation through time may reactivate favourably oriented existing discontinuities and cause multiple slip events. The likelihood of reactivations to occur is dependent on the prevailing stress field, the orientation of the fault and the strength of the fault surface (Sibson, 1985; Morris et al., 1996). Consequently, the geometry and the mechanical properties of geological brittle structures need to be systematically studied and taken into account as they may directly impact the planning and designing of excavations and reinforcements in underground construction projects (Hoek and Brown, 1980; Hudson et al., 2011; Fransson et al., 2019; Fransson and Viola, 2021). Underground spent nuclear fuel repositories, for example, require long-term tectonic stability and thus need to be built avoiding large brittle structures, since structural reactivation along a fault or a large fracture that intersects a spent nuclear fuel canister might jeopardize its integrity (e.g., Munier, 2006; McEwen et al., 2012). Therefore, the potential of (seismic) reactivation of pre-existing structures needs to be carefully assessed. Within the time period covered by the long-term safety assessment of a spent nuclear fuel repository, the formation and growth of new fractures has shown to be an improbable event and, as a consequence, the analysis of seismic risk is reduced to the analysis of pre-existing fractures and faults (SKB, 2011).\nMajor faults and fractures can be successfully modelled in 3D based on direct geological observations and can be avoided during the planning of the repository and positioning of the spent nuclear fuel canisters. Modelling, however, is commonly associated with inherent uncertainties, due to, for example, scarcity of data or poor conceptual understanding of the system under evaluation. Fortunately, the underlying geological uncertainties associated with complex deformation patterns may be significantly mitigated by constraining the geometry and kinematic history of the system under consideration through space and time. Hence, the study of geological properties and age relationships, particularly in the case of brittle deformation, becomes central to the understanding of the geological characteristics of a site.\nThe complex evolution and relative timing of multiple faulting and reactivation episodes in crystalline rocks can be unravelled through the detailed analysis of the structural geological record. Geometric, mechanical, metamorphic and kinematic considerations are used to understand complex fault architectures and fault rock assemblages as well as complex brittle relationships and histories (e.g., Viola et al., 2009; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Tartaglia et al., 2020; Skytt\u00e4 et al., 2021). The study of the fractal nature of brittle deformation is crucial because the analysis of specific faults at any given scale of observation may provide insights into the development history and properties of fault systems at all scales. The geometry and kinematics of individual faults are important when aiming to group brittle features into internally coherent sets with similar properties (Angelier, 1994; Saintot et al., 2011; Mattila and Viola, 2014).\nA major challenge when describing and unraveling the evolution of brittle structures in old, deeply exhumed basement rocks is the common lack of reliable time markers (such as sedimentary cover rocks or other well-dated geological objects) to help constrain in time deformation and correlate tectonic phases. This notwithstanding, the detailed evolution of some Precambrian faults and fracture networks has been successfully reconstructed by combining multidisciplinary studies integrating structural, geometric, kinematic and isotopic analyses (e.g., Mattila and Viola, 2014; Torgersen and Viola, 2014; Torgersen et al., 2015; Viola et al., 2016; Elminen et al., 2018; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Uysal et al., 2020). While detailed structural analyses can help establish the relative age relationships of different brittle structures, isotopic dating methods can constrain the absolute age of deformation. The potassium\u2011argon (K-Ar) geochronometer, for example, can be used to date synkinematic clays that form authigenically during faulting. In some cases, it has been possible to even date both the age of initial localization as well as of subsequent phases of structural reactivation (e.g., Dalrymple and Lanphere, 1969; Faure, 1987; Kralik et al., 1992; Haines and van der Pluijm, 2008; Viola et al., 2013; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber et al., 2019; Tartaglia et al., 2020; Curzi et al., 2020a).\nIn this study, we use a combination of structural and geochronological investigations to unravel the brittle faulting and fault reactivation history at the ONKALO\u2122 underground rock characterization facility and deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel, currently under construction, on the island of Olkiluoto in southwestern Finland (Fig. 1\n). We collected an extensive dataset on brittle faults intersecting the ONKALO\u2122 tunnels. We document the integrated multidisciplinary approach followed to characterize those brittle structures and to determine the relative age relationships of the occurring fault zones. To build an absolute time frame for the reconstructed faulting history, we also constrained the absolute timing of deformation by dating by K-Ar illite separated from fault gouge samples representative of specific fault sets. Based on this novel integrated and multidisciplinary analysis, we propose to classify brittle faults in ONKALO\u2122 into four different fault systems, each characterized by internally consistent structural properties and tectonic histories. We suggest that our approach is of general validity and may integrate multidisciplinary studies aiming at reconstructing long and complex brittle histories of basement blocks (e.g., Scheiber and Viola, 2018), particularly during the siting process for repositories of spent nuclear fuel.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting of southwestern Finland\nOlkiluoto is located within the central part of the Fennoscandian Shield, which was shaped during the Svecofennian orogeny (e.g., Ga\u00e1l and Gorbatschev, 1987; Gorbatschev and Bogdanova, 1993; Nironen, 1997; Lahtinen et al., 2009; Bogdanova et al., 2015). The area consists of Paleoproterozoic supracrustal rocks and granitoids (Fig. 1). Peak deformation, metamorphism and magmatism during the Svecofennian orogeny occurred at 1.88\u20131.87\u00a0Ga (Nironen, 1997; Lahtinen et al., 2005). Shortening and significant crustal thickening were followed by crustal extension and orogenic collapse at 1.86\u20131.84\u00a0Ga, before a pulse of renewed compression caused by the collision of the Sarmatian Plate with the Fennoscandian Shield (Lahtinen et al., 2005). High temperature metamorphism between ca. 1.87 and 1.79\u00a0Ga caused anatectic melting and widespread migmatisation in the middle crust, accompanied by the emplacement of voluminous, late orogenic leucogranites (Ehlers et al., 1993; Kurhila et al., 2005; Kurhila et al., 2010). Lahtinen et al. (2005) proposed a second phase of orogenic collapse between 1.79 and 1.77\u00a0Ga.\nThe transition from an overall ductile to brittle deformation style for the rocks currently exposed in southwestern Finland occurred ca. 1.79\u20131.75\u00a0Ga ago (Torvela et al., 2008; Mattila and Viola, 2014). Although the geological events between 1.79 and 1.65\u00a0Ga are still quite poorly constrained, that time is nonetheless believed to have witnessed rapid cooling, high erosion rates, and exhumation of the now exposed bedrock from 10\u201315\u00a0km (Nironen, 2017) to 5\u201310\u00a0km depth by the Mesoproterozoic (Eklund and Shebanov, 1999; Heilimo, 2005).\nThe Paleoproterozoic rocks shown in Fig. 1 were intruded by anorogenic rapakivi granites and diabase dykes between 1.65 and 1.47\u00a0Ga (R\u00e4m\u00f6 and Haapala, 2005; R\u00e4m\u00f6 and M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri, 2015). The Mesoproterozoic rapakivi magmas were sourced in the lower crust before a regional extensional\/transtensional tectonic regime allowed them to intrude into upper crustal levels by exploiting existing brittle structures (Mattila and Viola, 2014). The 1.4\u20131.3\u00a0Ga Satakunta sandstone deposited in a WNW-ESE graben structure, which, most likely, formed in response to the same rifting event responsible for the emplacement of the rapakivi granites (Kohonen et al., 1993). The Satakunta sandstone is cut across by olivine diabase dykes and sills dated to 1.27\u20131.25\u00a0Ga (Suominen, 1991). Their emplacement likely relates to the early rifting phase of Laurentia and Baltica (Bingen et al., 2008). The current erosion level of the Finnish basement bedrock was established before the Cambrian (Kohonen and R\u00e4m\u00f6, 2005). Successions of Cambrian to Devonian sediments were subsequently deposited on top of this basement level (Larson et al., 1999; Van Balen and Heeremans, 1998) that was then stripped to become exposed again during Quaternary times.\n\n2.1\nGeology of the Olkiluoto Island\nOlkiluoto is composed of Paleoproterozoic migmatitic supracrustal rocks, such as metapelites, meta-arenites and pyroclastic metavolcanites. Migmatites were intruded by two generations of pegmatitic granite at 1.86\u20131.82\u00a0Ga and 1.83\u20131.80\u00a0Ga (M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri et al., 2010) and by Mesoproterozoic diabase dykes (Aaltonen et al., 2016) (Fig. 2\n). In addition, a porphyritic granite is found as either <2\u00a0m thick subhorizontal sills crosscutting the migmatitic foliation or as more irregular plutonic volumes. U-Pb dating of the porphyritic granite suite yielded a 1.8\u00a0Ga age (M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri et al., 2007a; M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri et al., 2010).\nThe ductile history of the Olkiluoto basement records four main deformation phases, referred to as D1\n\u2013\n4 (Engstr\u00f6m, 2013; Aaltonen et al., 2016). D1 produced a weak schistosity locally overprinting a primary layering still preserved in the meta-supracrustal sequences. D2 is the most important deformation phase as it affected the whole region, shaping the regional structural grain. Migmatisation during D2 was widespread under amphibolite-facies metamorphic conditions (600\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C and 3.7\u20134.2\u00a0kbar) ca. 1.86\u20131.83\u00a0Ga ago (Tuisku and K\u00e4rki, 2010). D2 structures encompass the regional pervasive ~E-W to NE-SW gneissic foliation in addition to NE-SW striking folds and shear zones. During D3, the strongly migmatised and foliated bedrock was deformed in a heterogeneous fashion, as shown by F3 folds with SE dipping axial planes or dextral, E-W striking, high-grade shear zones. D4 formed NNE-SSW folds generating complex interference patterns with the older folds and ductile shear zones generally parallel to the axial surfaces and\/or fold limbs.\nHornblende, biotite, and muscovite 40Ar\u02d739Ar dating from Olkiluoto (Aaltonen et al., 2016) constrains the transition from the ductile to the brittle regime to ca. 1.79\u20131.72\u00a0Ga. In addition, it shows that the 1.57\u20131.55\u00a0Ga old rapakivi granite intrusions near Olkiluoto (Vaasjoki, 1996; R\u00e4m\u00f6 and Haapala, 2005) cooled down to below 300\u00a0\u00b0C during a 10\u201320\u00a0Ma long time period without causing any significant regional thermal overprint. The brittle structural history of the area was steered by the inherited ductile structural grain (Mattila and Viola, 2014; Skytt\u00e4 and Torvela, 2018). Microstructural and fluid inclusion studies from Olkiluoto have revealed that the first brittle structures formed already within the brittle-ductile transition zone, in response to transient and cyclical fluctuations of the fluid pressure (Marchesini et al., 2019; Prando et al., 2019). Paleostress inversion analysis fault-slip data has led to the recognition of at least seven distinct brittle deformation stages (Mattila and Viola, 2014, their Fig. 18 and 19). According to Mattila and Viola (2014), the Svecofennian Shield became \u201csaturated\u201d with brittle structures (meaning that no new brittle structures formed since then) already during the Mesoproterozoic. Hence, all fault systems from Olkiluoto are interpreted as having nucleated between ca. 1.75\u00a0Ga and 1.0\u00a0Ga. In the Neoproterozoic, renewed deformation took place in the form of reactivation, while no new faults nucleated.\nIn general, faults in Olkiluoto are mainly i) low-angle faults dipping gently to moderately towards the SE, ii) E-W striking faults dipping gently to moderately to the SSE-SSW and iii) subvertical to vertical faults striking on average N-S or NNW-SSE (Aaltonen et al., 2016; Mattila and Viola, 2014). Crosscutting relationships between major fault zones can be rarely observed in Olkiluoto, due to, the tunnel layout being specifically designed to avoid such intersections.\n\n\n\n3\nStructural data and methods\n\n3.1\nHierarchical classification of faults\nTo effectively describe the Olkiluoto brittle structural framework and to produce a hierarchical classification of faults and their sorting into internally consistent groups, we rely here on the conceptual classification proposed by Nordb\u00e4ck and Mattila (2018). They proposed to classify faults and fault sets as follows: Fault: single fault plane or shear fracture; Fault zone: network of interconnected faults, fault strands and fractures with a well-defined fault core (or cores) and damage zone, which can be taken as forming a single tabular geological object; Fault system: cluster of more than one fault zone; Fault complex: cluster of more than one fault system.\nIn this study, the smallest considered structural unit corresponds to mesoscopic single-plane faults with a documented length in the meter to tens of meter range (Nordb\u00e4ck, 2014). Also, we consider a fault system to be composed of multiple fault zones formed during the same tectonic event and with a mechanically compatible orientation in addition to a similar fault rock assemblage and kinematics. A fault system can be defined at a scale from hundreds of meters to kilometres. The grouping of fault zones into fault systems builds upon the work by Nordb\u00e4ck and Mattila (2018), and is further strengthened by additional data and results presented in this study. A fault complex encompasses all the fault systems from an investigated area or rock volume. A fault complex may thus be composed of fault systems of different age, kinematics and orientation.\n\n\n3.2\nUnderground mapping data\nA total of eleven fault zones were investigated in this study (Fig. 3\n), each considered to be representative of some key geological characteristics such as fault rock type and orientation and kinematics of the different fault systems from ONKALO\u2122. In addition to these fault zones, some other minor fault structures were also investigated and used to constrain specific crosscutting relationships between the structures of the different fault systems.\nONKALO\u2122 contains a 5\u00a0km long access tunnel, numerous shorter tunnels and three shafts reaching 455\u00a0m from the ground surface (Fig. 4A). In this study we have used the geological mapping dataset collected during the construction of ONKALO\u2122 between 2004 and 2018. As part of the tunnel mapping procedures, the location and properties of all lithological and structural elements were described, including geometrical and topological information on all fractures with trace length\u00a0>\u00a00.25\u00a0m (Nordb\u00e4ck and Engstr\u00f6m, 2016). This exceptionally large fracture trace dataset contains information on geometry and topology of over fifty thousand mapped fractures (Fig. 4A). Geological parameters have been systematically collected and 3D trace maps have been generated for all mapped faults and fractures (Fig. 4A). For shear fractures, information on slip direction and sense of movement is available as observed on slickensided surfaces (Fig. 4B). The exact location, geometry and dimension of fault zones intersecting the tunnel have been determined and are reported separately for damage and core zones of each fault. The width of damage zones is defined as the thickness of the rock volume (enveloping a fault core) wherein fracture intensity is higher than background values or where secondary fault structures such as Riedel fractures, are found around the core.\nIn this study we integrated the database by Nordb\u00e4ck and Mattila (2018) with additional structural mappings from all accessible tunnel and shaft sections, the analysis of photographs systematically taken from along the tunnel walls and structural interpretations based on digitised and measured fracture trace data. We use fault trace data to confirm the extent of damage zones for some of the larger fault zones (Fig. 4C). By interpreting the trace data from secondary fault structures (e.g., Riedel and step-over fractures), we were also able to define the kinematics of some of the fault zones (Fig. 4D). For information on the length of faults and fault zones we relied on results from the 3D modelling by Aaltonen et al. (2016). Detailed tunnel photography (Fig. 5A) enabled us to define the hosting lithology, the presence of possible ductile precursors and other geometrical parameters of fault zones. As part of our additional structural mapping, we used drone photography to document outcrops where faults were exposed in the tunnel floor (Fig. 5B).\n\n\n\n4\nDescription and classification of fault zones\nThe investigated faults and fault zones have been classified into four different systems based on distinctive features, such as orientation, kinematics, fault rocks and fracture filling mineralogy. We name the different fault systems Fault systems I- to IV (Table 1\n) and describe their characteristics in the following chapters.\n\n4.1\nStructural characteristics of the main fault systems\n\n4.1.1\nFault system I\nFaults of Fault system I on average are sub-vertical (84\u00b0) and strike NNE-SSW (008\u00b0), are sinistral strike-slip (Fig. 3A), and cut discordantly the regional foliation. The average slip direction plunges 10\u00b0 towards 005\u00b0 (Fig. 6A). Along single-plane faults we mapped apparent displacements in the order of a few centimetres, whereas for fault zones the apparent cumulative displacements may reach up to 2\u00a0m (Pere, 2009). The modelled lengths of the fault zones in this fault system reaches ca. 4\u00a0km (Aaltonen et al., 2016).\nMylonitic fault rocks are a unique feature of the Fault system I fault cores (Fig. 6B&C), as mylonites have not been observed in any of the other fault systems. Fault system I cores contain quartz veins as well as breccia layers and pockets with quartz, chlorite, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena. Mylonites are invariably reworked, and thus postdated by the breccias. Two generations of 1\u201320\u00a0cm thick quartz veins have been reported to typically occur within the core of these fault zones (Prando et al., 2019). The veins are described as being hydrothermal in origin and are usually associated with sulphides, epidote, as well as clay smearing along discrete slip surfaces that formed along the vein-host rock interface. The quartz veins are in turn crosscut by calcite-filled fractures.\nThe thickness of the fault cores for System I is between 0.1 and 0.5\u00a0m for faults that are less than 1\u00a0km in length and between 0.1 and 2\u00a0m for faults longer than 1\u00a0km. A 1\u20132\u00a0m thick and hydrothermally altered zone is usually associated with the core of the larger structures. Damage zones contain variably oriented secondary fractures and Riedel shears. The maximum width of the damage zones may reach up to 20\u00a0m. The kinematics of Fault system I structures is sinistral strike-slip, as documented by synthetic R and antithetic R' fractures (Fig. 6C) and slickensided planes, although a few dextral faults are also present (Fig. 6A) forming similar dihedral angles to the fault zones as the sinistral R fractures (Fig. 8A & B).\n\n\n4.1.2\nFault system II\nFault system II is composed of sub-vertical, NNW-SSE striking (340\u00b0) and steeply SW dipping (80\u00b0) dextral fault zones (Fig. 3A) that lack ductile precursors and cut through the structural grain of the migmatitic gneiss. The average slip direction plunges 07\u00b0 towards 346\u00b0 (Fig. 6D).\nFault system II fault zones have cores containing at least one relatively thick quartz vein, which may branch into multiple segments with connecting dextral step-over structures (Fig. 6E & F). Two different quartz generations have been recognised as forming the veins, with one pervasively dynamically recrystallised quartz generation postdated by a generation of white and more pristine quartz (Marchesini et al., 2019). Quartz veins containing chlorite, calcite and sulphides occur in the second generation (Marchesini et al., 2022). The thickness of the veins varies between 20\u00a0cm in the core of the kilometre-long fault zones and a few millimetres in the smaller ones. The damage zones contain Riedel fractures that are geometrically compatible with dextral strike-slip faulting (Fig. 6E), and long fractures parallel to the fault cores. Some localised evidence of sinistral strike-slip faulting has also been registered from the southernmost intersections of BFZ300 in ONKALO\u2122. The width of the damage zone is 4\u201312\u00a0m for structures \u22651\u00a0km and up to a couple of meters for fault zones up to 100\u2013200\u00a0m in length. An up to 2\u00a0m thick alteration zone also usually envelopes the core of the fault zones. Due to their similar orientation, small dextral Fault system II shear structures are difficult to distinguish from Fault system I Riedel fractures (Fig. 8A & B). From the 3D modelling of Fault system I and II fault zones, a fault zone pattern emerges where Fault system II fault zones (Fig. 8C & D) abut against fault zones belonging to Fault system I (Fig. 9F), thus suggesting that Fault system II is either coeval or postdating Fault system I (Peacock et al., 2017).\n\n\n4.1.3\nFault system III\nFault system III comprises E\u02d7W striking (092\u00b0), sub-vertical to moderately south-dipping (64\u00b0) fault zones (Figs. 3B; 7A). Slip is mainly oblique dextral with an average slip direction plunging 35\u00b0 towards 252\u00b0 (Fig. 7A), although sinistral reactivation has probably occurred as suggested by a few fault planes displaying a sinistral or reverse sense of movement. These mainly follow and exploit ductile precursors consisting of E\u02d7W trending and moderately south-dipping dextral D3 ductile shear zones (Fig. 8E). Up to 1\u00a0m apparent displacements have been measured for the fault zones of Fault system III. The ductile structures acting as precursors to Fault system III are composed of meter scale sheared tabular volumes containing a pervasive foliation (Fig. 7B). Local variations in the orientation of the ductile shear zones affect the orientation and localisation of the Fault system III structures. At some locations, fault zones have been observed to also exploit E-W striking contacts between different lithologies although at times they also crosscut the foliation of the moderately foliated migmatite gneiss they cut across (e.g., brittle fault zone BFZ297 in Fig. 7C).\nThe cores of the <1\u00a0km long Fault system III fault zones are tens of centimetres thick and consist of quartz cemented breccia, gouge and clay. Dextral Riedel fractures and rocks altered by chloritisation, sulphiditisation and graphitisation are the main features of Fault system III damage zones, which may be up to 10\u00a0m in thickness but generally are only a couple of m thick. In the Vehicle Access Tunnel 1 (Fig. 5B), an up to 1\u00a0cm thick illite layer was observed at the edges of the BFZ297 core.\n\n\n4.1.4\nFault system IV\nFault zones of Fault system IV dip on average gently to the SE (dip\/dip direction 18\/143\u00b0, Figs. 3C and 7D), although their orientation can locally be quite irregular. Mainly based on data from the structural logging of drill cores, the kinematics of Fault system IV slickensided surfaces are mostly indicative of reverse faulting, although normal slip is locally also present. At the tunnel scale however, the sense of movement of Fault system IV is unfortunately not always clear (Fig. 7D). The gentle dip of Fault system IV structures allows for longer intersections with the tunnel walls compared to any of the other structures, which, as discussed, are much steeper fault systems. Mapping indicates displacements in the order of a few tens of centimetres for the <100\u00a0m long BFZ101 fault zone; the displacement magnitude and kinematics of some of the longer (> km) fault zones is still poorly constrained.\nThe position of Fault system IV structures is partly controlled by ductile shear zones assigned by Aaltonen et al. (2016) to D4 and the occurrence of porphyritic granites (Fig. 7E). The porphyritic granites occur in the ONKALO\u2122 tunnel as either irregular bodies or as narrow 0.5\u20132\u00a0m thick sub-horizontal sheets that usually cut the migmatitic regional foliation at a small angle. Although the contacts between migmatites and porphyritic granites seem to be the most important planes of mechanical weakness, and thus the key anisotropy to localise later brittle deformation, Fault system IV structures are also partly controlled by the foliation of the migmatitic basement rocks. Where the foliation thereof is pervasive or where porphyritic granites are not present, the Fault system IV structures exploit the pre-existing weakness planes formed by the foliation of migmatites. As a result of the influence of the gently dipping porphyritic granites, Fault system IV structures display a somewhat lower dip angle than the general foliation dip of the migmatites (Fig. 8F). Depending on the direction of the porphyritic granites, Fault system IV fault zones may locally be N- or W-dipping and due to this strongly undulating behaviour may locally appear as a NW dipping normal faults, although the fault planes actually represent SE dipping thrusts when interpreted at the larger scale. Nevertheless, kinematic indicators suggesting localised extension are also present within the fault slip database.\nThe core of the Fault system IV fault zones contains lenses and pockets of crushed rock, gouge and clay (Fig. 7F), which can be up to a couple of m but, normally, are only a few cm thick. These fault products are compatible with the <100\u00a0\u00b0C hydrothermal fracture filling assemblages described by Aaltonen et al. (2018). Their damage zones, which may be up to 10\u00a0m thick, are characterized by zone-parallel fractures coated by chlorite, calcite, pyrite and various types of clays as filling. The thickness of the damage zones is usually lower where the fault zones follow the contacts to the porphyritic granites compared to areas where porphyritic granites do not occur (Fig. 7E & F).\n\n\n\n4.2\nRelative age relationships between fault systems\nCrosscutting relationships between the studied fault zones are only sporadically observed in the excavated tunnels, such that the systematic analysis of the relative timing of deformation is difficult. Crosscutting relationships are, instead, more commonly observed for the smaller faults (single plane faults) or between fault zones and single plane faults. These were thus studied making it possible to conclude the following: Fault system I and II single plane faults are systematically cut across and offset by fault zones belonging to Fault system III (Fig. 9A\u2013D) and Fault system IV (Fig. 9E). In addition, based on indirect (3D modelling) and direct outcrop observations, we conclude that Fault system II fault zones abut against the Fault system I fault zones (Fig. 9F),which indicates that Fault system II is either kinematically linked to or postdates Fault system I (Peacock et al., 2017). We note that small single plane faults do not necessarily invariably record the full deformation history typical of the larger fault systems they belong to, as reactivation may have been highly heterogeneous and selective.\nAt the intersection between structures DSM-BFZ006 (Fault system II) and BFZ297 (Fault system III; Fig. 9A), a much more pronounced epidotization and illitisation front affects the surrounding host rock in BFZ297 than in DSM-BFZ006. Cross-cutting relationships between Fault system III structures and Fault system IV structures have not been observed but the lack of quartz and hydrothermal alteration within Fault system IV may suggest that it formed at a later stage than the first three fault systems, which all contain quartz veins and hydrothermal alterations. Based on the observed relative age relationships, the proposed relative chronology of the identified fault systems is, from oldest to youngest, Fault system I to IV.\n\n\n\n5\nK-Ar fault rock dating\n\n5.1\nK-Ar dating technique\nThe analytical approach used to date illite from the sampled fault gouges was described in detail in Zwingmann and Mancktelow (2004), while a more recent general description of the procedure can be found in Viola et al. (2018). Additional information can be found in Appendix A. Seven standards (3 HD-B1, 3 LP6 and 1 GLO (Odin and 35 collaborators, 1982; Hess and Lippolt, 1994)) and four airshots (small aliquots of air) were analysed (Table 2\n). The error for the 40Ar\/36Ar value of the airshots yielded 295.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33 (1 sigma). The general error for the age standard is below 1% (1 sigma). K-Ar ages were calculated by using the 40K abundance and decay constants recommended by Steiger and J\u00e4ger (1977). The age uncertainties consider the errors during sample weighing, 38Ar\/36Ar and 40Ar\/38Ar measurements and K analysis. K-Ar age errors are reported within 1 sigma uncertainty.\n\n\n5.2\nK-Ar samples and preparation\nEight representative fault rock samples (Fig. 5) of approximately 80 to 500\u00a0g each were collected from the ONKALO\u2122 tunnel from the core of six different fault zones. One sample was collected from Fault system I, one sample from Fault system II, four samples from Fault system III and two samples from Fault system IV. The samples are from depths between \u2212337\u00a0m to \u2212437\u00a0m from ground surface. A total of 33 clay fractions were separated from the samples and analysed by K-Ar.\nTo enable validation of the geochronological results, the dated sample material must be characterized by a wide range of analytical techniques including: X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and particle granulometry (see summaries in Vrolijk et al., 2018; Viola et al., 2018; Curzi et al., 2020a; Tsukamoto et al., 2020). For this study, grain size fractions <2\u00a0\u03bcm in size were separated in distilled water according to Stoke's law. Additional sub-\u03bcm grain size fractions of <0.1 and 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm were obtained using a large capacity high speed centrifuge.\nFreshly broken surfaces of gouge sample chips were carbon coated and examined by SEM using a Zeiss EVO equipped with an energy dispersive system X-ray analyzer (EDS) (Fig. 11A). The mineralogy of the size fractions was determined by XRD on air-dried and glycolated samples following the approach outlined in Moore and Reynolds (1997). XRD analytical procedures are described further in Appendix A.\n\n\n\n6\nSample characterization and age determination\n\n6.1\nMineralogy of clay samples\nThe mineralogical composition of the dated grain-size fractions was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD;Fig. 10\n; Appendix B). The analysed gouges exhibit a significant variability in mineralogy and proportions of the occurring minerals, whereas different size fractions from the same gouge samples are, instead, mineralogically quite similar. The most common clay minerals are smectite, chlorite and illite. Most samples contain the 2M1 illite polytype but sample 2370 also contains 1M\/1Md (lower temperature) illite and small amounts of chlorite. The illite\/mica 2M1 polytype can represent a mixture of authigenic and detrital illite\/mica (protolithic muscovite). However, since the bedrock in Olkiluoto contains less than 4% muscovite (K\u00e4rki and Paulam\u00e4ki, 2006), we exclude significant protolithic muscovite contamination (Zwingmann et al., 2010; Viola et al., 2013). SEM imaging of the sample material (Fig. 11A), documents the systematic presence of idiomorphic illite with regular, euhedral grain boundaries with sharp edges, typical for an authigenic and synkinematic origin in gouge samples from Fault system I and IV. SEM investigation of samples collected from Fault system II and III, on the other hand, seems to suggest a lesser extent of deformation, as indicated by typical illite\/smectite aggregates.\n\n\n6.2\nK-Ar illite age results\nK-Ar illite ages were obtained from the separated <0.1 to 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm clay-size fractions (Table 3\n), with radiogenic 40Ar content ranges from 90.1 to 99.7% indicating reliable analytical conditions for all analyses. K concentrations range from 2.3 to 6.5% as function of the heterogeneous mineralogy of the dated fractions. The ages vary between 916.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.6\u00a0Ma to 1549.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031.7\u00a0Ma. A clear trend of decreasing age with decreasing grain size is documented (Figs. 11B and 12\n), with age differences between the coarsest and the finest fractions from the same sample between 147.4 and 384.6\u00a0Ma. K-Ar ages from Fault System I range between 1275.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.4\u00a0Ma and 1549.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031.7\u00a0Ma (1 sample, 4 fractions). For fault system II, ages range between 1102.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.4\u00a0Ma and 1400.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.2\u00a0Ma (1 sample, 4 fractions). K-Ar ages from fault system III range from 916.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.6\u00a0Ma and 1384.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027.6\u00a0Ma (2 samples with 5 fractions, 1 sample with 4 fractions and 1 sample with one fraction). For fault system IV ages range from 953.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.2\u00a0Ma to 1337.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.7\u00a0Ma (2 samples with 5 fractions).\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nAge results interpretation\nIn this study we rely on the \u201cAge Attractor Model\u201d proposed by Torgersen et al. (2015) and Viola et al. (2016) to interpret the obtained age results. According to this model, the amount of old and inherited protolithic clay in a fault gouge decreases with the decreasing grain size of the dated fraction compared to the amount of authigenic and synkinematic clay, which instead increases with decreasing grain size. Thus, the coarsest sample fractions may contain relatively large amounts of old protolithic clay and the intermediate fractions a mixture of protolithic and authigenic minerals, such that dates do not necessarily reflect the timing of fault initial slip or reactivation. Instead, although even the finest fractions of illite may be variably contaminated by the host rock or may have experienced some degree of partial overprinting and resetting by younger tectonic and thermal events, many studies have shown that the finest illite sample fractions (< 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm or finer) yield a quite reliable record of the timing of the last brittle faulting event recorded by the fault (Viola et al., 2013, 2016; Torgersen and Viola, 2014; Mancktelow et al., 2015; Aldega et al., 2019; Scheiber et al., 2019; Curzi et al., 2020a; Curzi et al., 2020b; Tartaglia et al., 2020). Due to the clear observed trend of decreasing age with decreasing grain size within our data (Fig. 11B), we thus discuss and focus our interpretations on the results from the finest and geologically most meaningful fractions.\nBased on the current understanding of the thermal development of the Olkiluoto area (Aaltonen et al., 2016), significant 40Ar diffusion by a post-faulting thermal overprint up to 300\u00a0\u00b0C is unlikely (Akker et al., 2021), making the finest fractions even more reliable time markers. Their ages, however, need to be considered as only a maximum age of faulting because they may still contain varying amounts of inherited protolithic K-bearing phases that can influence the apparent age. Only if all K-Ar ages obtained from one sample are statistically identical for all dated grain size fractions, it is possible to assume that the age of the finest fraction as well as of all other fractions represents the true age of the last recorded faulting event (Torgersen et al., 2015).\nOut of the eight analysed fault rock samples, we could date the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction only from four samples: samples 2364 and 2367 from Fault system III and samples 2369 and 2370 from Fault system IV (Fig. 11B). A\u00a0<\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction was extracted and dated instead from three of the samples: sample 2363 from Fault system I, sample 2368 from Fault system II and sample 2365 from Fault system III (Fig. 11B). The smallest dated fraction for sample 2367 from Fault system III is <2\u00a0\u03bcm (Figs. 11B; 12; Table 3). The ages yielded by these clay fractions are listed in Table 4\n. The results thus only loosely constrain a K-Ar age of 1.28\u00a0Ga for sample 2363 from Fault system I fault zone BFZ045 (< 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm) and a somewhat younger K-Ar age of 1.10\u00a0Ga for sample 2368 from Fault system II fault zone BFZ300 (< 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm). Results are instead more indicative and reliable for Fault system III, where K-Ar ages, between 1.24 and 0.92\u00a0Ga from BFZ084 (sample 2367) and BFZ297 (samples 2364, 2365 and 2366) were obtained from <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm to <2\u00a0\u03bcm fractions. For Fault system IV we managed to also obtain two ages from the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction, indicating a last recorded slip event at 0.95\u00a0Ga and 1.04\u00a0Ga for fault zones BFZ020a (sample 2369) and BFZ020b (sample 2370), respectively.\nOur K-Ar age results define a wide spread of overlapping ages (Table 3; Fig. 11B). Nevertheless, when assessing only the results from same fractions of different samples and from the finest clay fractions, a few trends do emerge (Table 4; Fig. 11B). The 1.28\u00a0Ga age for the <0.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction from Fault system I is consistent with the result from the same fraction from Fault system III sample 2364. In addition, a 1.24\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar age was also determined for the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction from Fault system III sample 2364 which we interpret as the approximate age for a faulting event that affected Fault systems I and III. The 1.10\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar age for the <0.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction from Fault system II sample 2368 is consistent with the results from the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm and\u00a0<\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcm fractions of sample 2367 from Fault system III, which also record ages around 1.10\u00a0Ga. The determined 1.04\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar age for the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction of sample 2370 is the oldest age we register from Fault system IV. Despite the minor inconsistency between the finest fraction ages from samples 2367, 2368 and 2370, we interpret these three age results as representing the same faulting event affecting Fault system II, III and IV between 1.1 and 1.0\u00a0Ga. The grain size of finest dated fractions of samples 2365 and 2366 of Fault system III and sample 2369 of Fault system IV varies between <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm and 2\u00a0\u03bcm, but all record ages younger than 1.0\u00a0Ga. The sample 2369\u00a0<\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction from Fault system IV records a K-Ar age of 0.95\u00a0Ga while the <0.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction of sample 2365 from Fault system III registers an age of 0.92\u00a0Ga and the <2\u00a0\u03bcm fraction of sample 2366 from Fault system III an age of 0.98\u00a0Ga. We interpret these age results as broadly defining a faulting event that affected Fault system III and IV roughly 0.95\u00a0Ga ago.\nOur ages agree to some extent with the results of previous radiometric K-Ar studies from Olkiluoto by Viola et al. (2011b) and M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri et al. (2007b) (Table 4). We note, however, that the study by M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri et al. (2007b) only dated 2\u00a0\u03bcm fraction, making it difficult for a straight comparison with the ages of our dated finer fractions. This notwithstanding, as a whole the age data define four different faulting events (Fig. 13\n), which, although only loosely constrained from an absolute time perspective, are rather consistent with the independent structural and geological constraints highlighted above: (1) A faulting event at ca. 1.3\u20131.2\u00a0Ga, responsible for Fault system I and Fault system III. This deformation stage is the only episode recorded by the dated samples of Fault system I. (2) A faulting event at 1.1\u20131.0\u00a0Ga, which is recorded in Fault system II, III and IV. (3) A faulting event at c 0.97\u20130.87\u00a0Ga, which is recorded by Fault system III and Fault system IV. (4) A significantly younger event at ca. 0.55\u00a0Ga, only recorded by Fault system IV (M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri et al., 2007b; Viola et al., 2011b). Despite minor inconsistencies between the grain size of the dated finest clay fractions of the different samples and some variations of the age results, the identified clusters and general trends of the available radiometric age data outline possible faulting episodes that give and find further support in the interpretation of the structural geological tunnel mapping data (Fig. 8A-F). Fig. 11B visualizes all our age data according to the different fault systems, highlighting the overlaps of the K-Ar data and related uncertainties of our interpretations.\n\n\n7.2\nEvolution of the fault complex of Olkiluoto\nBased on the presented structural data, we can define four distinct brittle fault systems at Olkiluoto. Their relative age and kinematics have been determined by the characterization of representative fault zones. Due to the internal consistency of these datasets in terms of geological attributes, geometry, kinematics, and relative age relationships between specific types of faults, we consider the reconstructed fault systems and their relative age relationships as reliable and representative of the overall geological framework of Olkiluoto. Importantly, based on the orientation of the modelled fault zones in Aaltonen et al. (2016), 94% of the faults of the studied database fit with one of the four defined fault systems, indicating that our structural classification is well representative of the entire Olkiluoto fault complex. In the following we integrate our structural constraints with the new geochronological K-Ar data to constrain the initial formation of the fault systems and their selective reactivation during specific later tectonic events (Fig. 14\n).\nBrittle deformation in Olkiluoto was preceded by a long history of ductile deformation that created heterogeneous migmatitic rocks with pre-existing planes of weaknesses that, to a varying degree, steered the initial development of different fault systems. Indeed, a complex tectonic history for the Olkiluoto site is suggested by the many fault rock types associated with the different fault systems and by the multiple generations of fault products within individual fault zones (see also Marchesini et al., 2019; Marchesini et al., 2022; Prando et al., 2019). This structural complexity is corroborated by our new K-Ar age results, which reveal and date multiple brittle events. Unfortunately, when dealing with such long deformation histories (implying several reactivation episodes) it is difficult to establish the age of initial nucleation and localisation of a fault system, and, therefore, to confidently interpret all the obtained radiometric results. In fact, as only maximum ages of deformation, even the reported ages of the finest fractions may be misleading as they may result from processes of partial resetting due to multiple mechanical reactivations of the dated fault system and fluid-rock interaction (see Zwingmann et al., 2019). Additionally, our results indicate that some of the tectonic events in the area (Fig. 14) reactivated only part of the pre-existing fault systems within Olkiluoto, specifically fault structures oriented optimally for reactivation within the prevailing stress field. In the following, based on our new structural and geochronological data and previously published results, we interpret most of our new K-Ar data as representing structural reactivation of pre-existing fault systems. As shown by our structural constraints, however, fault zones in Olkiluoto do not contain much structural evidence attesting to the kinematics of superimposed reactivation episodes and at times only inferences can be made. In addition, some of the observed abutting and\/or crosscutting relationships may be due to initial fault localization and do not necessarily express reactivation by later deformation episodes. Since original striations on slickensides and crosscutting relationships between fault systems are generally well preserved, we conclude that the amount of deformation during reactivations of previously formed fault systems has been relatively low and that reactivations may have been localised mainly within fault cores. Reactivation potential of individual faults or fault zones can also vary within a single fault system, as, in addition to geometric and dynamic criteria, the shear strength of individual faults can also be affected by the presence of mineralizations or by the presence of fluids, which may vary between faults in the same fault system. Thus, the validation of the model we propose, based on structural and K-Ar data would still require further detailed structural investigations of individual fault zones, associated with targeted additional dating and mineralogical studies.\nThese limitations and uncertainties notwithstanding, a theoretical model for the major phases of fault instability in Olkiluoto is presented in Fig. 14, where it is compared to recognised tectonic events previously proposed for southwestern Finland (Mattila and Viola, 2014). In the following, we discuss the details of the brittle evolution of the area.\n\n7.2.1\nFault system I (1.79\u20131.2\u00a0Ga)\nFault system I, which we interpret as the oldest of the four fault systems documented in ONKALO\u2122, displays the broadest documented range of fault products, including mylonite, pseudotachylite, cataclasite, breccia, quartz veins, synkinematic sulphide mineralizations, gouge and clay smears. The structures of Fault system I are sinistral strike-slip faults, approximately parallel to NNE\u2013SSW trending, high-grade ductile shear structures (Skytt\u00e4 and Torvela, 2018) that formed along the limbs of F4 folds towards the end of D4 (1.81\u00a0Ga ago, described in Aaltonen et al., 2016). At the tunnel scale, however, Fault system I structures cut the regional ductile structural grain.\nThe presence of N-S oriented mylonitic fabric is unique for Fault system I and only associated to the brittle structures of this system. We find these observations in line with the model by Prando et al. (2019), wherein the mylonitic phase is synchronous with the commencement of the brittle phase and cyclic quartz vein emplacement at the brittle-ductile transition zone (Fig. 14). Some of the hydrothermal alteration and quartz veining processes studied in southwestern Finland have been found to be related to the late Svecofennian tectonics and the structurally controlled accumulation and percolation of metamorphic or magmatic fluids at the brittle-ductile transition (Saalmann, 2007; Saalmann et al., 2009). The source of the fluids that triggered the first embrittlement in Olkiluoto and emplaced the quartz veins in Fault system I are thus presumably connected to similar processes. Large scale NE-SW trending and steeply SE dipping late-Svecofennian ductile shear zones in southern Finland (V\u00e4is\u00e4nen and Skytt\u00e4, 2007) show a long deformation history spanning from ductile to brittle deformation, with a progressive change towards more brittle deformation with time (Saalmann, 2007; Torvela et al., 2008). Many of these mylonitic shear zones were sinistrally reactivated during the final stages of the Svecofennian orogeny (Ploegsma and Westra, 1990; Pajunen, 2008). The sinistral reactivation event of the NE-SW trending shear zones is compatible with the formation of Fault system I during the late-Svecofennian, in response to paleostress conditions characterized by NW-SE to NNW-SSE shortening (Stage 1 in Mattila and Viola, 2014; Fig. 14). Hence, we consider the obtained 1.3\u20131.2\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar dates obtained from samples representative of Fault system I as a record of late reactivation of the fault system, which first formed at the transition from an overall ductile to brittle regime, occurring ca. 1.79\u20131.75\u00a0Ga ago in southern Finland (Torvela et al., 2008; Aaltonen et al., 2016).\nThis late reactivation of Fault system I, as constrained by the K-Ar data, postdates the extensional tectonic events during rapakivi intrusions and the formation of the Satakunta graben. Our obtained K-Ar ages of 1.3\u20131.2\u00a0Ga for Fault system I are matching closely however, with the ages of Postjotnian diabases (Suominen, 1991; Fig. 14). Mattila and Viola (2014) proposed the possibility that Postjotnian diabases formed in response to a phase of NE-SW compression (stage 5 in Mattila and Viola, 2014; Fig. 14). Geochronological 40Ar-39Ar K-feldspar and biotite results by Heeremans and Wijbrans (1999) from the Porkkala-M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 shear zone in southern Finland provided ages in the range of 1.3\u20130.95\u00a0Ga. These results show that late-Svecofennian shear zones were affected by brittle faulting and resetting of the K-Ar system during the time of intrusions of Postjotnian diabases and the Sveconorvegian orogeny (Fig. 14). Hence, we propose that the 1.3\u20131.2\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar results from Fault system I in Olkiluoto date local fault reactivation in response to the tectonic and thermal events related to the intrusion of Postjotnian diabases. Our K-Ar data do not register any later reactivations of Fault system I, although we note that this does not exclude that other reactivations may have occurred.\n\n\n7.2.2\nFault system II (1.79\u20131.1\u00a0Ga)\nFault system II is composed of sub-vertical, NNW-SSE striking and steeply dipping dextral strike-slip faults that, as in the case of Fault system I, cut through the migmatitic gneiss foliation. They contain both quartz veins and evidence of hydrothermal alterations. Based on direct observations at the tunnel scale made on smaller-scale structures interpreted as Fault system II structures as well as on 3D modelling of the BFZ300 and BFZ346b fault zones, this fault system forms a NNW-SSE trending sub-vertical minor dextral fault set, interconnecting larger NNE-SSW striking sinistral Fault system I structures (Fig. 8D). Thus, the topological relationship between Fault system I and II differs from a synchronously formed and crosscutting conjugate fault pair, formed within a single stress field. Furthermore, the absence of mylonitic precursors in Fault system II indicates that Fault system I formed earlier and under more ductile conditions than Fault system II.\nMicrostructural, fluid inclusion and thermobarometry studies by Marchesini et al. (2019) and Prando et al. (2019) show that Fault system I and II both formed at the brittle-ductile transition zone (Fig. 14) through cyclic and fluid- induced slip at progressively lower temperature and pressure in an overall ductile regime. For fault zone BFZ300 (Fault system II), temperature and pressure conditions of the circulating fluids at the onset of localization have been constrained to 350\u00a0\u00b0C and 2.1\u00a0kbar (Marchesini et al., 2019), respectively, which is slightly lower than the 450\u00a0\u00b0C, 3\u20133.5\u00a0kbar determined for the mylonitization of fault zone BFZ045 (Fault system I) (Prando et al., 2019). Thus, the model of distributed strike-slip shear by Schreurs (2003), is a reasonable analogue for the formation of Fault system I & II at mid-crustal levels. According to this model, the initial formation of Fault system I \u201cmaster\u201d faults would have caused local changes in the stress field that, with increasing strain, caused the formation of antithetic Fault system II \u201ccross-faults\u201d, which interconnected the older, but still active, Fault system I structures. Marchesini et al. (2019) attributed the first development of the BFZ300 fault damage zone and the first generation of quartz to stage 1 by Mattila and Viola (2014), with paleostress conditions characterized by NW-SE to NNW-SSE compression, while the second generation of quartz in the core of BFZ300 emplaced under pure brittle conditions consistent with stage 2 of (Mattila and Viola, 2014; Fig. 14) of N-S to NNE-SSW transpressional compression. These results also suggest that the first embrittlement of Fault system I and II occurred in response to the same tectonic events during late-Svecofennian times, which would fit with the criteria of Schreurs (2003) for distributed strike-slip shear zones. A local clockwise rotation of the principal stress tensor in response to the formation of the Fault system I faults would also serve as a possible explanation for the accordingly rotated stage 2 stress tensor compared to stage 1 stress tensor in Mattila and Viola (2014).\n\nMarchesini et al. (2019) identified possible later reactivations of fault zone BFZ300, suggesting an E-W compressional tectonic regime. The 1.1\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar age from our BFZ300\u00a0<\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcm sample is also consistent with the suggested timing of stage 6 of Mattila and Viola (2014), characterized by E-W compression during the initial phases of the Sveconorwegian orogeny (Fig. 14), that initiated at 1.14\u00a0Ga ago (Bingen et al., 2008; Viola et al., 2011a). Based on crosscutting relationships, the formation of Fault system II predates the formation of Fault system III (Fig. 9A), which, in combination with the 1.2\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar ages of Fault system III (Fig. 13), indicate that Fault system II experienced reactivation after the formation of Fault system III. We acknowledge however, that the indistinct morphology of Fault system II and III sample materials (Fig. 11A) requires much caution when interpreting the obtained K-Ar ages.\n\n\n7.2.3\nFault system III (1.6\u20130.9\u00a0Ga)\nFault system III contains E\u02d7W striking sub-vertical to moderately south-dipping dextral to oblique dextral\/normal fault zones that are controlled by ductile precursors consisting of E\u02d7W trending and moderately south-dipping dextral ductile shear zones. According to M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri et al. (2006), the shear zones were formed during deformation phase D3, ca. 1.86\u20131.82\u00a0Ga ago (Fig. 14). Fault system III structures have not been the subject of detailed studies as those carried out on fault zones BFZ045, BFZ100 and BFZ300 (Pere, 2009; Marchesini et al., 2019; Prando et al., 2019) and therefore the evolution of this fault system remains poorly constrained.\nDue to crosscutting relationships, differences in orientation and kinematics between fault zones and secondary structures (such as Riedel fractures) of the first two fault systems and Fault system III, Fault system III likely formed in response to a later tectonic event than those responsible for the first two systems. Although quartz and hydrothermal alterations are present in all the first three fault systems, due to the observed differences in filling mineralogy and hydrothermal alterations (Fig. 9A), we propose that the fluids that circulated in Fault system III have their origin from other sources than the fluids that caused the embrittlement and formation of quartz veins in Fault system I and II. Aaltonen et al. (2018) assigned the main hydrothermal episode in Olkiluoto to the intrusion of anorogenic rapakivi granites and mafic magmatism at around 1.5\u20131.6\u00a0Ga (Vaasjoki, 1996; R\u00e4m\u00f6 and Haapala, 2005; Fig. 14). Furthermore, Aaltonen et al. (2018) linked the hydrothermal alteration products such as quartz and illite to processes associated with the migration of 200\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C hot fluids expelled from the crystallising rapakivi magma. Seismic surveys in Olkiluoto also indicate that rapakivi granites are found at >3\u00a0km depth below the island (Kukkonen et al., 2010). Thereby, the rapakivi granites represent the most likely source for the hydrothermal fluids circulating in Fault system III.\nHowever, the oblique dextral\/normal kinematics for fault zones of the E-W striking Fault system III cannot be assigned to the NW-SE tensional or transtensional paleostress stage defined by Mattila and Viola (2014) for the latter stages of the Gothian orogeny (\u00c5hall et al., 2000; Korja et al., 2001) and the intrusion of the rapakivi granites at around 1.5\u20131.6\u00a0Ga (Fig. 14). Thus, our hypothesis is that Fault system III formed in response to a previously undefined transtensional paleostress stage affecting the bedrock of southern Finland, possibly related to the episodic subduction and plate jamming associated with the Gothian orogeny (\u00c5hall et al., 2000). A brittle tectonic event at 1.52\u00a0Ga has been constrained by means of Rb-Sr dating of fine-grained mineral slickenfibres (illite and\/or K-feldspar with calcite and\/or albite) by Tillberg et al. (2020) in Forsmark, Sweden, although in association with kinematic data indicative of WSW-ENE compression. The K-Ar age results of Fault system III (Fig. 13), however, record later faulting events taking place between 1.2 and 0.9\u00a0Ga. Based on these results, Fault system III most likely reactivated simultaneously with the fault zones of Fault system I ca. at the time of Postjotnian diabase intrusions (Suominen, 1991), corresponding to the stage of NE-SW compression proposed in Mattila and Viola (Mattila and Viola, 2014; Fig. 14). The younger K-Ar ages of 1.1 and 0.9\u00a0Ga can be linked to further reactivations both at the onset and at the waning stage (orogenic collapse) of the Sveconorwegian orogeny (Fig. 14), with the initial phase characterized by E-W compression (stage 6 in Mattila and Viola, 2014) and the collapsing phase by E-W extension (stage 7 in Mattila and Viola, 2014).\n\n\n7.2.4\nFault system IV (1.1\u20130.9\u00a0Ga)\nFault system IV contains low-angle fault zones that, in general, dip gently towards SE. Their kinematics are not univocal based on tunnel data, but drill hole observations suggest a thrust faulting-related origin. Fault system IV structures exploit planes of pre-existing weakness in the bedrock represented by lithological contacts between porphyritic granite rocks and weaknesses of the migmatitic foliation planes.\nStructures of Fault system IV differ from the other fault systems since they lack evidence of hydrothermal alteration at temperatures higher than 200\u00a0\u00b0C, including quartz fillings and pervasive alteration of the host rock. The distinctly different mineralogical properties of Fault system IV, in combination with the observed crosscutting relationships to other fault systems (Fig. 9), leads us to interpret Fault system IV as the youngest of the four fault systems. The clustering of the oldest K-Ar ages of the Fault system IV samples around 1.04\u20131.0\u00a0Ga (Fig. 13) suggests that Fault system IV nucleated after the approximately 1.3\u20131.2\u00a0Ga event, which was recorded by both Fault system I and III. Slickenfibre Rb-Sr dating of the ZFM1203 structure in Forsmark (southeastern Sweden), with similar gently south dipping orientation, similar geological properties and kinematics as the structures of Fault system IV in Olkiluoto, yielded two different ages of 1.44\u00a0Ga and 1.07\u00a0Ga (Tillberg et al., 2020), with the latter fitting the K-Ar ages from Olkiluoto. In addition, Tillberg et al., 2021 also dated a vein mineralization sample from Forsmark to 1.1\u00a0Ga. These dating results support the paleostress analysis by Mattila and Viola (2014) where several stress tensors from Olkiluoto were interpreted to define a tectonic event with roughly E-W compression during the early stages of the Sveconorvegian orogeny (Fig. 14). The 0.87\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar age from brittle deformation zone BFZ099 (Viola et al., 2013; Fig. 13) can be interpreted as due to a reactivation of Fault system IV during the collapsing phase of the Sveconorwegian orogeny (Fig. 14). Elminen et al. (2018) obtained a 0.97\u00a0Ga\u00a0K-Ar date from an extensional fracture from southern Finland that they also ascribed to the collapse of the Sveconorwegian orogeny. Previous studies (Elminen et al., 2018; M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri et al., 2007b; Tillberg et al., 2020, 2021; Viola et al., 2011b) have, in addition, identified later reactivations that have been linked to NW-SE to E-W crustal shortening during the early stages of the Caledonian orogeny (Viola et al., 2009; Saintot et al., 2011; Fig. 14).\n\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nFaults from Olkiluoto can be grouped into four distinct fault systems, each containing structural features that share similar tectonic histories and structural properties. From the oldest to the youngest fault systems are named as Fault systems I to IV. The chronological order and constraints on these four fault systems were determined based on their overall geological, geometric and kinematic characteristics and crosscutting relationships, whereas isotopic K-Ar data provided further constraints on the timing of formation and reactivation of the different fault systems (Fig. 14). In a broader context, the new data and interpretations presented above show that the bedrock in southern Finland experienced at least five major phases of deformation within the brittle regime spanning the period between ca. 1.75\u00a0Ga and 0.9\u00a0Ga. In addition, previous studies have identified possible further reactivation of Fault system IV structures, during the early stages of the Caledonian orogeny 0.5\u20130.4\u00a0Ga ago. The identified brittle deformation phases include:\n\n1)\nFormation of N-S striking strike-slip faults at the brittle-ductile transition zone soon after the Svecofennian orogeny ca. 1.79\u20131.75\u00a0Ga ago in response to NW-SE to NNW-SSE compression, also causing brittle reactivation of late-Svecofennian NE-SW striking ductile shear zones.\n\n\n2)\nFormation of E-W striking oblique dextral\/normal faults in response to transtensional stresses tentatively associated to the tectonic events of the Gothian orogeny ca. 1.6\u00a0Ga ago.\n\n\n3)\nNE-SW compression causing reactivation of the pre-existing fault systems at around 1.3\u20131.2\u00a0Ga, coeval with intrusion of olivine diabase sills.\n\n\n4)\nFormation of low-angle thrust faults and reactivation of some of the pre-existing fault systems in response to E-W compression during the onset of the Sveconorwegian orogeny ca. 1.1\u20131.0\u00a0Ga ago.\n\n\n5)\nE-W extension during the post-orogenic collapse of the Sveconorvegian orogen selectively reactivating some of the existing fault systems ca. 0.97\u20130.87\u00a0Ga ago.\n\n\n6)\nNW-SE to E-W compression ca. 0.55\u00a0Ga ago prior to the Caledonian orogeny, reactivated low-angle thrust faults.\n\n\n\nAs such, our study yields new useful insights into the long, multistage and complex tectonic evolution of the bedrock in southern Finland and represents an example of general validity of how multidisciplinary studies make it possible to unravel even complex deformation histories of old crystalline terranes leading to time-constrained reconstructions.\n\n","107":"","108":"","109":"","110":"","111":"","112":"","113":"","114":"","115":"","116":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nUltramylonite is a strongly sheared fault rock characterized by remarkably fine-grained (commonly <10\u00a0\u03bcm) minerals with a well-developed foliation and lineation, indicative of intensely localized plastic deformation, commonly via diffusion creep (e.g., Boullier and Gueguen, 1975; Nicolas and Poirier, 1976; Jaroslow et al., 1996; Michibayashi and Mainprice, 2004; Warren and Hirth, 2006; Michibayashi et al., 2012; Hansen et al., 2013; Tasaka et al., 2014; Hidas et al., 2016; Nicolas et al., 2017; Pr\u00e9cigout et al., 2017; Prigent et al., 2017; Vieira Duarte et al., 2020). Ultramylonites have commonly been observed in abyssal peridotites, in particular at fracture zones (e.g., Tilley, 1947; Nicolas et al., 1980; Jaroslow et al., 1996; Warren and Hirth, 2006; Kohli and Warren, 2019; Prigent et al., 2019).\nMicrostructures of mantle rocks record the compositional, thermal, and stress conditions of the asthenosphere and lithosphere that affect the mechanical response of the oceanic lithosphere during seafloor spreading (Jaroslow et al., 1996). Nicolas et al. (1980) were the first to identify crystal-preferred orientations (CPOs) of olivine in abyssal peridotites obtained from fracture zones and suggested that extensive plastic flow could take place in such an oceanic environment. Those authors showed that deformation textures in abyssal peridotites can be used to distinguish between asthenospheric flow fabrics beneath a mid-ocean ridge and subsequent plastic deformation fabrics associated with emplacement at the seafloor. Jaroslow et al. (1996) suggested that deformation in some fine-grained mylonites (i.e., ultramylonites) occurred by diffusion creep at temperatures as low as ~600\u00a0\u00b0C and concluded that a reduction in grain size by cataclasis or dynamic recrystallization resulted in a transition of deformation mechanism from dislocation creep to diffusion creep during uplift (and\/or cooling). Warren and Hirth (2006) further demonstrated that a transition to diffusion creep promotes the randomization of pre-existing CPOs, resulting in long-term weakening of the lithosphere in the case of rocks being deformed in the brittle\u2013ductile regime. More recently, Kohli and Warren (2019) examined intensely deformed peridotites in detail and identified hydrous mineral grains, such as amphibole, in the fine-grained matrix, suggesting that fluid infiltration into the brittle\u2013ductile transition zone initiated a positive feedback loop between hydration and deformation that promoted strain localization through hydrolytic weakening and amphibole formation. Kohli and Warren (2019) also reported that olivine CPOs are weak to random in fine-grained bands.\nIn this study, we examined the textures and olivine CPOs of intensely deformed amphibole-bearing ultramylonitic peridotites as well as other highly deformed peridotites dredged from the Marion Fracture Zone during the 1984. In particular, we focus on two well-layered ultramylonites that have clear olivine CPOs despite their fine grain sizes of <10\u00a0\u03bcm and which have not been previously reported. We argue using evidence of spinel microboudinage within the ultramylonites that the olivine CPOs can be explained by low-temperature (low-T) plasticity caused by strain-hardening induced by higher stress toward the plastic-brittle transition under hydrous conditions in the final stage of deformation during uplift (and\/or cooling).\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) extends ~6500\u00a0km northeastward from the Bouvet to Rodriguez triple junctions (Fig. 1\n). The Marion Fracture Zone lies on the ultraslow spreading SWIR at 33\u00b030\u2032E between the northern branch of the Andrew Bain Fracture Zone to the west and the Prince Edward Fracture Zone to the east (Fig. 1; Fisher et al., 1986). The Marion Fracture Zone offsets the SWIR by 120\u00a0km to the northeast and is flanked by high transverse ridges that rise ~4\u00a0km above the floor of its ~35-km-wide 5200-m-deep transform valley, from which the studied peridotite samples were collected by dredging (Fisher et al., 1986).\nUnlike fast-spreading ridges, there is little evidence for steady-state magma chambers beneath SWIR, as found at the East Pacific Rise, owing to the very low rate of magma supply. Overall, the crust is thin and discontinuous (Zhou and Dick, 2013), commonly with widely spaced and large volcanic segments that connect numerous transform faults and oblique amagmatic segments (e.g., Sauter et al., 2004). This pattern can produce marked variations in crustal thickness over relatively short (~100\u00a0km) length scales (e.g., Rommevaux et al., 1994; Zhao et al., 2013; Schlindwein and Schmid, 2016). Owing to the rough topography and variable magma budget, diabase, gabbro, peridotite, and metamorphic rocks have been obtained by numerous dredge surveys (Fig. 1; e.g., Dick, 1989; Dick et al., 2003; Seyler et al., 2003; Zhou and Dick, 2013), making the Marion Fracture Zone an ideal location for studying the lower crust and mantle, and investigating magmatic and tectonic processes.\nMantle peridotites, mostly granular and porphyroclastic harzburgites, have been dredged from the Marion Fracture Zone and adjacent Marion Transform, and are associated with pillow basalt, diabase, and gabbro, showing that the transform walls expose the lower crust and mantle (Protea expedition, leg 5, on the R\/V Melville, 1984) (Fig. 1; Fisher et al., 1986). Mylonitic and ultramylonitic peridotites, which are the focus of this study, were collected from the eastern wall of the Marion Transform by dredge 19 (D19; Fig. 1), at depths of 3900 to 2700\u00a0m on the Marion Transform wall located at approximately 46\u00b030\u2032S and 33\u00b050\u2032E (Fig. 1; Prigent et al., 2019). We observed 25 thin sections of dredge 19 samples stored at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and then cut 14 of the D19 samples into rock slabs to make new thin sections for this study.\n\n\n3\nMethods\nWe prepared 30-\u03bcm-thick thin sections from rock slabs. Then, the thin sections were divided into two types: XZ type and NO (non-oriented) type. Of the 14 samples studied, 6 XZ type peridotite samples were cut on the plane perpendicular to the foliation and parallel to the lineation (i.e., the XZ plane). The other eight NO type peridotite samples were cut on a plane not clearly related to any structures because of their heterogeneous appearance. For this study, we have finally chosen the 6 XZ type peridotite samples in order to analyse their CPOs in detail. All XZ type thin sections were polished using 1\u00a0\u03bcm diamond paste and colloidal silica for >5\u00a0h for microstructural observations and analyses.\nCPOs of olivine grains were measured by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) system (HITACHI S-3400\u00a0N Type II with HKL Channel5) at the Rock and Mineral Laboratory, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan. Operating conditions were 20\u00a0kV accelerating voltage and low vacuum mode (30\u00a0Pa). In order to measure an average CPOs for each sample, we manually measured more than 200 crystal orientations of randomly selected olivine grains per sample throughout the entire thin section, and each crystal orientation was projected onto a lower-hemisphere equal-area stereonet. As the EBSD method is able to measure not only crystal orientations but also to identify mineral textures by a mapping mode, mineral-phase maps were obtained using step sizes of 2.5 to 5.0\u00a0\u03bcm in limited sections shown in Figs. 2\u20133\n\n. We used Aztec 4.2 and MATLAB\u00ae MTEX Toolbox software (version 5.7.0) to process map data by ignoring single wild spikes and extrapolating non-indexed pixels with the average orientation of neighbouring pixels. We determined grain boundaries in the mineral-phase maps where misorientations between two neighbouring pixels were\u00a0>\u00a010\u00b0.\nFabric strength and the distribution density of the principal crystallographic axes characterize a CPO (e.g., Michibayashi and Mainprice, 2004). We used the J-index (Mainprice and Silver, 1993) to quantify the intensity of a given CPO, where\nJ\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u222b\u00a0f(g)2\ndg. The J-index has a value of 1 for randomly oriented crystals and infinity for a single crystal. In a similar manner, The pfJ index has a value of unity for a random distribution and a maximum value for olivine of ~60 in the present case for a single crystal of olivine. In the present case of olivine, the [100], [010], and [001] axes are all two-fold rotation axes, meaning that the pfJ values can be directly compared. The fabric strength was also determined using the M-index technique (Skemer et al., 2005). Using this approach, the distribution of random-pair misorientation angles of a sample (Wheeler et al., 2001) is compared with the distribution of misorientation angles from a theoretical random fabric. The M-index is scaled from zero to one, where M\u00a0=\u00a00 represents a random fabric and M\u00a0=\u00a01 represents a single crystal. We calculated the J, pfJ, and M index values using MATLAB\u00ae MTEX Toolbox software (version 5.7.0).\nOlivine CPOs are thought to vary with the amount of water in olivine crystals and stress conditions, resulting in A, B, C, D, and E type fabrics (e.g., Karato et al., 2008). These fabric types are related to olivine slip systems, with type A characterized by (010)[100] slip, B by (010)[001] slip, C by (100)[001] slip, D by {0kl}[100] slip, and E by (001)[100] slip. In addition, the AG type (Mainprice, 2007) is commonly found in nature and is characterized by (010) axial patterns (e.g., Isma\u00efl and Mainprice, 1998; Tommasi and Vauchez, 2015).\nOlivine CPOs can be evaluated quantitatively from P-wave seismic velocities (Mainprice, 1990; Michibayashi et al., 2016). To define the six olivine fabric types (i.e., A, B, C, D, E and AG types) in a diagram, we consider the three principal P-wave velocities (V\n\n1\n, V\n\n2\n, and V\n\n3\n), where V\n\n1\n is the maximum P-wave velocity, V\n\n3\n is the minimum P-wave velocity, and V\n\n2\n is the intermediate P-wave velocity in the direction perpendicular to both V\n\n1\n and V\n\n3\n. Here, we define one of the principal P-wave velocities close to the X-axis to be V\n\nx\n, the second one close to the Y-axis to be V\n\ny\n, and the third one close to the Z-axis to be V\n\nz\n (Michibayashi et al., 2016). Then, a Flinn-type diagram is used to characterize a fabric type of each CPO with its fabric intensities (Michibayashi et al., 2016). In this diagram, V\n\nx\n\n\/V\n\ny\n and V\n\ny\n\n\/V\n\nz\n are the vertical and horizontal axes, respectively, and (1,1) is the origin. In this way, the fabric index angles for the six olivine fabric types can be defined by the angle of inclination between the origin and a point in the diagram: 63\u00b0 for A type, \u221228\u00b0 for B type, 158\u00b0 for C type, 90\u00b0 for D type, 106\u00b0 for E type, and 0\u00b0 for AG type (Michibayashi et al., 2016).\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nMicrostructures\nPhotomicrographs of XZ-type samples are presented along with the phase maps obtained by EBSD analyses in Figs. 2\u20133. Two peridotite samples (D19\u201358 and D19\u201347) are well-layered ultramylonites consisting mostly of an extremely fine-grained (<10\u00a0\u03bcm) matrix with several relatively large (>100\u00a0\u03bcm) porphyroclastic grains (Fig. 2). The two ultramylonites contain olivine, spinel, and amphibole grains in the matrix and as porphyroclasts (Fig. 2c\u2013d). The rock contains alternating layers of olivine and amphibole, as well as layers containing both minerals, showing that amphibole, a hydrous mineral, was extensively deformed during shearing. Within the D19\u201347 ultramylonite (Fig. 2b), coarse porphyroclastic spinel grains have been intensely fractured and subsequently pulled apart, and fine-grained olivine and amphibole grains fill the spaces between spinel fragments (Fig. 2d\u2013f).\nTextures of the other four XZ type peridotites are highly heterogeneous, with various-sized strained\/elongated porphyroclastic grains of olivine and pyroxene having been dynamically recrystallized into variably sized smaller grains along localized fine-grained zones (Fig. 3a\u2013h). These peridotites contain olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and spinel with or without plagioclase and amphibole. Acicular amphibole occurs with sparse chlorite grains, cuts olivine and pyroxene crystals, as occurs as fracture infill (Fig. 3e\u2013f).\n\n\n4.2\nCrystallographic preferred orientations\nOlivine CPOs of XZ type samples are shown in Fig. 4\n. One of the two well-layered ultramylonites (D19\u201358) shows a bimodal CPO of B and E type fabrics consisting of [001](010) and [100](001) patterns with the [100] and [001] maxima being parallel to X and the [010] maximum being subparallel to Y (Fig. 4a). The other well-layered ultramylonite (D19\u201347) appears to have a B type fabric with a weak E type fabric pattern (Fig. 4b). Of note, these two ultramylonites have higher fabric index values (J-index: 2.97 and 4.58, M-index: 0.0941 and 0.1580, respectively; Fig. 4a\u2013b) than the other peridotites, despite their very fine grain sizes (Fig. 2).\nPeridotite sample D19\u201385 (Fig. 3a\u2013b) shows a weak E type fabric with a [100] maximum close to X, a [010] maximum subparallel to Y, and a [001] maximum close to Z (Fig. 4c), and has the lowest fabric strength of the XZ type peridotites (J-index: 1.988, M-index: 0.0346). Peridotite sample D19\u201386 (Fig. 3c\u2013d) has a unique CPO, as defined by three great circles (Fig. 4d), which could represent an axial [100] pattern (D type). The other two XZ type peridotites (D19\u20135 and D19\u20132; Fig. 3e\u2013h) show weak A-type fabrics with the [100] maximum subparallel to X, the [010] maximum close to Z, and the [001] maximum close to Y (Fig. 4d\u2013f). The fabric strengths of the latter three peridotite samples are 2.10 to 2.47 for the J-index and 0.0431 to 0.0774 for the M-index (Fig. 4d\u2013f).\n\nFig. 5\n shows the CPOs of olivine and amphibole for the two well-layered ultramylonites, derived from the EBSD maps in Fig. 2c\u2013d. Unlike the manually measured CPOs shown in Fig. 4a\u2013b, olivine CPOs are characterized by axial [010] patterns with both [100] and [001] maxima subparallel to X with a girdle distribution, and the [010] maximum parallel to Z (i.e., axial [010] pattern or AG type). Moreover, the CPOs of ultramylonite D19\u201358 show a weak girdle distribution of [010]. The fabric strengths of olivine CPOs in Fig. 5 have similarly high values to those of manually measured CPOs in Fig. 4a\u2013b.\nAmphibole CPOs show clear [001](100) patterns (Fig. 5), although amphibole grains within the two ultramylonites are as fine as the olivine grains (Fig. 2c\u2013d). Similar CPOs have been reported in previous studies, including Nicolas et al. (2017), Prigent et al. (2018), Kohli and Warren (2019), and Vieira Duarte et al. (2020).\n\nFig. 6\n shows a Vp\u2013Flinn diagram for olivine CPOs. Olivine CPOs for the two well-layered ultramylonites (D19\u201358 and D19\u201347) of XZ type show interesting features, whereby although manually measured CPOs are different from each other (a and b in Fig. 6), their CPOs derived from EBSD maps are located in a similar AG type domain (a\u2019 and b\u2019 in Fig. 6). E type CPOs in Fig. 4c (D19\u201385) plot outside the region for E type in Fig. 6, indicating that the CPOs may be not sufficiently uniform to represent a true E type fabric. The CPOs of peridotite D19\u201386 plot very close to the D type line (d in Fig. 6), whereas the CPOs of D19\u20135 and D19\u20132 plot close to the A type line (e and f in Fig. 6).\n\n\n\n5\nInterpretation\n\n5.1\nVariations in olivine CPOs in Vp\u2013Flinn diagrams\n\n5.1.1\nOccurrence of intermediate olivine CPOs among six olivine fabric types\nOlivine crystal fabrics of A, B, C, D, and E type are thought to vary with the amount of water in olivine crystals and stress conditions (e.g., Karato et al., 2008), in addition to the AG type fabric in nature (e.g., Isma\u00efl and Mainprice, 1998; Tommasi and Vauchez, 2015; Michibayashi et al., 2016; Bernard et al., 2019). Apart from AG type, experimentally established relationships between water content and olivine fabric type (i.e., for A to E types) are reasonably consistent with observations of natural samples (e.g., Mizukami et al., 2004; Jung et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2015). Michibayashi and Oohara (2013) reported natural examples of an olivine fabric transition across a hydrous ductile shear zone where the hydrous reaction forming amphibole and chlorite became stronger toward the centre of the shear zone, whereas olivine fabrics were developed from D type in the margin to E type to C type and to random fabrics in the centre of the shear zone. Although the temperature conditions varied from 900 to 750\u00a0\u00b0C, and olivine showed evidence of grain-size reduction, the olivine fabric transition of the study of Michibayashi and Oohara (2013) seems to be consistent with the experimentally established olivine fabric regime in a water\u2013stress diagram (Karato et al., 2008). In contrast, Kumamoto et al. (2019) found that olivine CPOs did not evolve systematically with water content. Bernard et al. (2019) also found little evidence for a relationship between olivine CPO and water content and stress in naturally deformed peridotites. Therefore, the existence of a relationship between olivine CPO and water content and stress is still uncertain. One of the reasons for this ambiguity may be the difficulty of classifying a CPO into one of six olivine fabric types.\nBesides, some intermediate olivine fabrics have been documented in both natural and experimental studies, as reported by Wallis et al. (2019). Tasaka et al. (2016) experimentally produced bimodal CPOs formed by slip on the (001)[100] and (100)[001] slip systems and to a lesser extent the (010)[100] slip system at shear strains of \u03b3\u00a0>\u00a05 in water-saturated olivine aggregates. Wallis et al. (2019) suggested that the olivine crystal fabric of Tasaka et al. (2016) is similar to that of the sheared lherzolite xenolith reported by Mercier and Carter (1985), as shown in Fig. 2 of Wallis et al. (2019). Ohuchi et al. (2012) investigated the effects of water on the development of olivine crystal fabrics in simple-shear deformation experiments under conditions of the asthenospheric upper-mantle (P\u00a0=\u00a02.1\u20135.2\u00a0GPa, T\u00a0=\u00a01490\u20131830\u00a0K) using a deformation-DIA apparatus, and identified four types of olivine fabric: A, B, B type-like, and C\/E. Of these types, the B type-like fabric is interpreted to result from the (010)[h0l] [u0w?] slip system, whereas the C\/E type could be similar to C and\/or E type fabrics (Ohuchi et al., 2012). Kang and Jung (2019) documented A type, mixed A\/B type, and B type-like fabrics in hydrated mantle peridotites from Norway. These previous studies suggest that intermediate olivine crystal fabrics could be a common feature in deformed hydrous peridotite and thus in hydrous mantle.\n\n\n5.1.2\nIntermediate olivine CPOs in Vp-Flinn diagram\nPole figures projected on equal-area, lower-hemisphere stereonets are commonly used to show olivine CPOs, such as those in Fig. 4. However, it is not always easy to determine which olivine fabric type is the most important of these CPOs. The Vp\u2013Flinn diagram, which provides a representation of the finite Vp anisotropy ellipsoid derived from olivine CPOs, is an alternative method based on Mainprice (1990) for quantifying olivine fabric types and enables a quantitative evaluation of olivine CPOs by the angle of inclination between the origin and a point in the diagram (i.e., the fabric index angle or FIA) and distance from the origin (Fig. 6; Michibayashi et al., 2016). However, as the olivine CPO for the well-layered ultramylonite D19\u201358 in Fig. 4a plots close to the A type line in the Vp\u2013Flinn diagram (a in Fig. 6), a misleading interpretation of such a specific olivine CPO may be made, as it appears to have a bimodal CPO consisting of [001](010) (B type) and [100](001) (E type) patterns. Here, we explore the Vp\u2013Flinn diagram in more detail than its original conception proposed by Michibayashi et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n5.2\nOlivine fabric transition: General trends in a Vp\u2013Flinn diagram\n\nFig. 7a shows trends in olivine fabric transition inferred from geometric relationships in pole figures. The pole figures show that AG type is an intermediate type between A and B types, whereas D type is an intermediate type between A and E types. In this way, an intermediate type between B and C types can be identified, which we tentatively name \u201cHBC type\u201d (where \u201cH\u201d stands for \u201cHybrid\u201d) (Fig. 7a). In the Vp\u2013Flinn diagram, three P-wave velocities (Vp) parallel to the main crystallographic axes in a single olivine crystal (i.e., V\n\na\n, V\n\nb\n, and V\n\nc\n) characterize olivine fabric types by their orientations in the structural framework (x\u2013y\u2013z axes). Thus, as the AG type is characterized by a girdle pattern of both [100] and [001] axes, and a single point maximum for the [010] axis, Michibayashi et al. (2016) assumed that three Vp values for the AG type in a single crystal are V\n\nx\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\nz\n\u00a0=\u00a0(V\n\na\n\u00a0+\u00a0V\n\nc\n)\/2 and V\n\ny\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\nb\n, whereas those for D type are V\n\nx\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\na\n and V\n\ny\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\nz\n\u00a0=\u00a0(V\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0V\n\nc\n)\/2 (Fig. 7a). In a similar way, the three Vp values for the HBC type are V\n\nx\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\nc\n and V\n\ny\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\nz\n\u00a0=\u00a0(V\n\na\n\u00a0+\u00a0V\n\nb\n)\/2 (Fig. 7a).\nWe can expand these equations for three continuous trends. From A to AG to B type, the three Vp values can be given as V\n\nx\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b1\n\n1\n\nV\n\na\n\u00a0+\u00a0(100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b1\n\n1\n)V\n\nc\n)\/100, V\n\ny\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\nb\n, and V\n\nz\n\u00a0=\u00a0((100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b1\n\n1\n)V\n\na\n\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b1\n\n1\n\nV\n\nc\n)\/100, where 0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b1\n\n1\n\u00a0\u2264\u00a0100. From A to D to E type, we have V\n\nx\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\na\n, V\n\ny\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b1\n\n2\n\nV\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0(100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b1\n\n2\n)V\n\nc\n)\/100, and V\n\nz\n\u00a0=\u00a0((100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b1\n\n2\n)V\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b1\n\n2\n\nV\n\nc\n)\/100, where 0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b1\n\n2\n\u00a0\u2264\u00a0100. From B to HBC to C type, we have V\n\nx\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\nc\n, V\n\ny\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b2\n\n3\n\nV\n\na\n\u00a0+\u00a0(100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2\n\n3\n)V\n\nb\n)\/100, and V\n\nz\n\u00a0=\u00a0((100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2\n\n3\n)V\n\na\n\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b2\n\n3\n\nV\n\nb\n)\/100, where 0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b2\n\n3\n \u2264\u00a0100. Fig. 8\n shows the results of the three general trends with increments of 2 (small dots) and 10 (large circles) for \u03b1\n\n1\n, \u03b1\n\n2\n, and \u03b2\n\n3\n. Note that the Vp values along the three general trends vary between types, defining the theoretical maximum Vp values depending on the FIA.\n\n\n5.3\nOlivine fabric transition: Specific trends in a Vp\u2013Flinn diagram\n\nTasaka et al. (2016) experimentally produced a bimodal distribution of CPOs consisting of (100)[001] (C type) and (001)[100] (E type) patterns. In this study, we found a bimodal distribution of CPOs consisting of (010)[001] (B type) and (001)[100] (E type) patterns in ultramylonite (D19\u201358; Fig. 4a\u2013b). The bimodal CPOs cannot be explained by the general trends for olivine fabric transition in Fig. 7a. Thus, we propose the other trends as shown in Fig. 7b. Our bimodal CPOs in Fig. 4a\u2013b could be an intermediate type between B and E types, whereas the bimodal CPOs of Tasaka et al. (2016) could be intermediate between C and E types. We tentatively name these \u201cHBE type\u201d and \u201cHCE type\u201d, respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 7b, it is possible to calculate three Vp values for the two specific trends. From B to HBE to E type, the three Vp values can be explained by V\n\nx\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b2\n\n1\n\nV\n\na\n\u00a0+\u00a0(100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2\n\n1\n)V\n\nc\n)\/100, V\n\ny\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b2\n\n1\n\nV\n\nc\n\u00a0+\u00a0(100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2\n\n1\n)V\n\na\n)\/100, and V\n\nz\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b2\n\n1\n\nV\n\nc\n\u00a0+\u00a0(100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2\n\n1\n)V\n\nb\n)\/100, where 0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b2\n\n1\n\u00a0\u2264\u00a0100. From C to HCE to E type, we have V\n\nx\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b2\n\n2\n\nV\n\na\n\u00a0+\u00a0(100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2\n\n2\n)V\n\nc\n)\/100, V\n\ny\n\u00a0=\u00a0V\n\nb\n, and V\n\nz\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b2\n\n2\n\nV\n\nc\n\u00a0+\u00a0(100\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2\n\n2\n)V\n\na\n)\/100, where 0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b2\n\n2\n\u00a0\u2264\u00a0100. Fig. 8 shows the results for the two specific trends with increments of 2 (small dots) and 10 (large circles) for \u03b2\n\n1\n and \u03b2\n\n2\n. Note that the Vp values along the two specific trends vary between types (Fig. 8). Although calculated Vp anisotropies are the theoretical maximum values for an individual FIA, Vp anisotropies for \u03b2\n\n1\n trending from B to HBE to E type are substantially lower than those for \u03b1\n\n1\n\u2013\u03b1\n\n2\n trends from B to AG to A to D to E type (Fig. 8).\n\n\n5.4\nOlivine fabrics of XZ type peridotites in a Vp\u2013Flinn diagram\nHere, we evaluate our olivine CPO data in terms of the olivine fabric transitions presented in Figs. 7\u20138. Note that this comparison is possible only for XZ type peridotites, as a fabric type is determined based solely on the structural framework.\nThe bimodal CPO for ultramylonite D19\u201358 in Fig. 4a plots close to the A type line in the Vp\u2013Flinn diagram (a in Fig. 6). Here, considering that the bimodal CPOs consist of a mixture of B and E types, we estimate that \u03b2\n\n1\n is ~57 (a in Fig. 8), indicating that this bimodal CPOs is a typical HBE type. The other ultramylonite (D19\u201347) also seems to contain a small component of E type (Fig. 4b), as we estimate that its \u03b2\n\n1\n is ~32 (b in Fig. 8). However, both olivine CPOs derived from the EBSD maps shown in Fig. 5 plot close to the HBE type line (a\u2019\u2013b\u2019 in Fig. 8). The difference between the manually measured olivine CPOs and those generated from the EBSD maps in Fig. 8 may be due to the difference in methods: i.e. the manual method could be measured olivine grains almost evenly in the entire thin section, whereas the EBSD map could be only measured a small portion of the thin section. Nonetheless, olivine CPOs of the two ultramylonites contain substantial B-type components (Fig. 8).\nThe CPOs of D19\u201385 (Fig. 4c) may be interpreted in terms of the \u03b2\n\n2\n trend, meaning that they contain some C-type components (c in Fig. 8). If we assume that the CPOs of the other three peridotites (Fig. 4d\u2013f) can also be related to the \u03b2\n\n1\n trend, the main component would be E type. Otherwise, we interpret them simply as either A type or D type (d\u2013f in Fig. 8).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nDevelopment of olivine CPOs with\/without amphibole deformation\nThe XZ type peridotites show ultramylonitic (Fig. 3) or otherwise very heterogeneous textures (Fig. 3). It is difficult to identify the olivine fabric types in the studied samples solely on CPO data, except for the two ultramylonitic peridotites shown in Fig. 4. In contrast, the fabric types can be easily identified from Vp-Flinn diagrams, along with the fabric intensities. Indeed, the data in the Vp-Flinn diagram (Fig. 8) seem to indicate the effect of hydration during microstructural development and the type of olivine crystal fabrics. The two ultramylonites (Fig. 2) and one deformed peridotite (D19\u201385 in Fig. 3a) contain amphibole grains that were deformed in a fine-grained matrix, whereas the other deformed peridotites (D19\u201386 in Fig. 3c, D19\u20135 in Fig. 3e, D19\u20132 in Fig. 3g) contain amphibole that grew after deformation. These observations are consistent with the olivine CPOs, as the former three samples have hybrid olivine CPOs of the specific fabric trends (a-a\u2032, b-b\u2032 and c in Fig. 8) that might have developed under hydrous conditions, whereas the latter three samples have olivine CPOs of the general fabric trends (d, e and f in Fig. 8) that likely formed under anhydrous conditions.\n\n\n6.2\nDevelopment of well-layered ultramylonites (D19\u201347 and D19\u201358)\n\n6.2.1\nSyn-deformational hydration reactions\nAmphibole is abundant within the ultramylonites and the deformed peridotites, but chlorite or other hydrous minerals are rarely identified, as revealed by EBSD mapping (Figs. 2\u20133). This is consistent with previous studies of ultramylonites obtained from the fracture zones along SWIR (Jaroslow et al., 1996; Kohli and Warren, 2019; Prigent et al., 2019). The occurrence of ultramylonitic peridotites containing large amounts of amphibole and minor pyroxene (Fig. 2) suggests that the consumption of pyroxene was promoted by hydration. Moreover, spinel porphyroclasts were replaced by olivine and amphibole (Fig. 2). To produce amphibole in ultramafic rocks, Jenkins (1981) showed experimentally that under forsterite- and water-saturated conditions, pyroxene and spinel react to produce amphibole at temperatures of <800\u00a0\u00b0C under low pressure (~200\u00a0MPa) conditions: Opx\u00a0+\u00a0Cpx\u00a0+\u00a0Sp\u00a0+\u00a0H2O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Amp\u00a0+\u00a0Fo, where Opx, Cpx, Sp, Amp, and Fo in the formula are orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, spinel, amphibole, and forsterite, respectively. Pr\u00e9cigout et al. (2017) estimated a water content of ~600\u00a0ppm at temperatures of <750\u00a0\u00b0C during deformation of an ultramylonite band in the Ronda peridotite, where amphibole is the only hydrous mineral. Kohli and Warren (2019) showed that the fine-grained bands in mylonites obtained from the Shaka transform fault are enriched in amphibole, suggesting that hydration reactions were favoured in zones of strain localization. Those authors estimated a minimum upper bound for mylonite deformation of 800\u2013850\u00a0\u00b0C and 0.45\u00a0GPa. Prigent et al. (2019) showed that High-T (HT) (859\u2013875\u00a0\u00b0C) mylonites contain only amphibole as a hydrous phase, whereas Moderate-T (MT) (~500\u2013750\u00a0\u00b0C) mylonites contain chlorite as well as amphibole (Prigent et al., 2019). These findings suggest that the well-layered amphibole-bearing ultramylonites of the present study could have been formed at temperatures of ~800\u00a0\u00b0C under water-saturated conditions.\n\n\n6.2.2\nDevelopment of strain-hardening-induced CPOs and spinel microboudins during uplift\nThe two well-layered ultramylonites (D19\u201358 and D19\u201347) have distinct olivine CPOs rather than random fabrics, although their fabric strengths are not particularly high (Figs. 4a\u2013b and 5). These CPOs seems to be unique in abyssal peridotite. For example, Jaroslow et al. (1996) showed that the finest-grained (<10\u00a0\u03bcm) regions of a peridotite mylonite have weak or no CPOs, whereas coarser-grained regions exhibit strong CPOs and pronounced grain flattening, suggesting that a transition from dislocation to diffusion creep occurred with decreasing grain size. Kohli and Warren (2019) reported that olivine exhibited strong CPOs in coarse-grained bands, and weak to no CPOs in fine-grained bands, and proposed that the hydration reaction to form tremolite in fine-grained bands promoted grain-size reduction and a change in olivine deformation mechanism from dislocation creep to diffusion creep. Prigent et al. (2019) also found that the grain-size reduction associated with both MT and HT mylonite deformation provides a weakening mechanism, meaning that diffusion creep is dominant. Warren and Hirth (2006) argued that a transition to diffusion creep promotes the randomization of pre-existing CPOs, resulting in long-term weakening of the lithosphere for rocks deforming in the brittle\u2013ductile regime. Therefore, it is likely that grain-size reduction to form ultramylonites results in weak or random CPOs. However, the CPOs of the two well-layered ultramylonites of this study are not random, despite their very fine-grained textures (Fig. 2). Although CPO patterns are different between manual and mapping modes, the [001](010) (B type) slip system must be taken into account in both CPOs (Figs. 4b and 5).\nIn the D19\u201347 ultramylonite, segments of fractured spinel porphyroclasts have been pulled apart and\/or displaced in the fine-grained matrix, and the olivine infill has been strongly recrystallized into fine grains (Fig. 2f). The fracture surfaces are not always parallel to one another, indicating that these segments have been rotated by shearing. Moreover, the existence of olivine infills in the gaps indicates that the separation of the segments occurred simultaneously with hydrous reactions during shearing (Fig. 2d\u2013f). Mode-I cracks in spinel with olivine and amphibole infills have been reported previously in mylonite\u2013ultramylonite samples (e.g., Pr\u00e9cigout et al., 2017).\n\nLi and Ji (2019) argued that rocks containing microboudinage record a tectonic history of continuous hardening prior to the cessation of mineral plasticity, and presented a model of microboudin formation with respect to shear strength (Fig. 9a), in which sequential fracturing and separation of fragments during progressive cooling and exhumation upward from the brittle\u2013ductile transition produced a series of microboudins. Based on a study of a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge, Kohli and Warren (2019) presented a schematic diagram for the mechanical strength of the upper mantle, where hydration and strain localization result in a transition in olivine deformation mechanism from dry dislocation creep and grain boundary sliding (GBS) in the deepest part of the brittle\u2013ductile transition, to wet diffusion creep in the shallowest part (Fig. 9b). Those authors calculated olivine deformation mechanism maps for both dry and wet conditions at 750\u00a0\u00b0C, and showed that a key difference between the wet and dry maps is that the dislocation-accommodated GBS field is replaced by diffusion creep and low-temperature plasticity (LTP) (e.g., Katayama and Karato, 2008) under the conditions of mylonite deformation, where diffusion creep is the weakest deformation mechanism at grain sizes of ~1\u00a0\u03bcm to 1\u00a0mm. Here, if we assume that spinel microboudinage could occur as a result of continuous hardening prior to the cessation of olivine and amphibole plasticity, the deformation mechanism would change from diffusion creep to LTP (Fig. 9b), possibly resulting in the development of weak CPOs, as well as a foliation, as is observed for the well-layered ultramylonites (Fig. 2). The olivine CPOs of the ultramylonites are characterized by B type CPO components (Figs. 4\u20135), which could be activated under hydrous and higher-stress conditions than those for C and E types (Karato et al., 2008). In addition, dense dislocations have been observed within ultramylonite sample D19\u201347 in a transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) study (Igami and Michibayashi, 2021). Consequently, we argue that the well-layered ultramylonites preserve the final stage of strain localization that occurred during uplift under hydrous and higher-stress conditions. Under the influence of LTP, complex slip systems can produce bimodal CPOs that are HBE type (manual mode in Fig. 4) or AG type (mapping mode in Fig. 5), depending on the geometric effect of each olivine grain in the fine-grained matrix under hydrous and higher-stress conditions.\n\n\n\n6.3\nHydrous shearing in the regions beneath transform faults\nOur sample locations range from high to low on the eastern Marion Transform wall (Fig. 1). Only 5% of the peridotites dredged from transform walls are mylonites (Dick, 1989). Moreover, mylonites do not occur randomly in peridotite dredge hauls. Rather, almost the entire haul is mylonite or protogranular and porphyroclastic peridotites (Dick, 1989). In general, the dredge samples represent loose talus, and there is rare evidence that they have been ripped from outcrops. Most samples are from debris fields produced by mass movements. This is consistent with peridotite mylonites sampled in situ from detachment footwalls, representing thick zones of shear deformation measuring a few hundred meters and underlain by massive granular peridotite.\nThe mylonites dredged from the base of the transform wall might have been uplifted by late faulting from the transform slip zone, but it is more likely that they represent the detachment fault shear zone as it turns and merges into the transform slip zone below the transform wall (Schroeder and John, 2004; deMartin et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 2013; Dick et al., 2019). This becomes the western branch of a fault flower structure formed by extension of the opposing detachment fault intersections with the transform slip zones, as observed at Kane Megamullion on the MAR and at Atlantis Bank on the SWIR (Dick et al., 2008, 2019). The conditions of formation of these mylonites, however, should replicate those in the principal transform slip zone and show that water-influenced high-temperature granulite-facies deformation must be occurring at depth within the main transform slip zone, with a consequent reduction in strength and viscosity (e.g., Nicolas et al., 2017; Kohli et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe examined the textures and olivine CPOs of amphibole-bearing deformed peridotites dredged from the Marion Fracture Zone of the Southwest Indian Ridge by dredge D19 of the 1984 PROTEA Expedition Leg 5 cruise of the RV Melville during the 1984. Among the six XZ type peridotites studied, the two ultramylonites contain olivine, spinel, and amphibole grains in the matrix and as porophyroclast, whereas the other four peridotites are highly heterogeneous, with various-sized strained\/elongated porphyroclastic grains of olivine and pyroxene.\nThe Vp\u2013Flinn diagram provides a representation of the finite Vp anisotropy ellipsoid derived from olivine CPOs and enables a quantitative evaluation of olivine CPOs. We examined the five fabric trends in the Vp-Flinn diagram in order to evaluate the intermediate fabric types of olivine CPOs. In particular, two well-layered ultramylonites have clear olivine CPOs despite their fine grain sizes of <10\u00a0\u03bcm and which have not been previously reported. The two well-layered ultramylonites are characterized by bimodal CPOs of (010)[001] and (001)[100] (tentatively named as HBE type) or a strong maximum of [010] normal to the foliation and girdle patterns of both [100] and [001] on the foliation plane. It shows that the olivine CPOs of the ultramylonites are characterized by B type CPO components, which could be activated under hydrous and higher-stress conditions than those for C and E types. Moreover, the EBSD mapping revealed that the two ultramylonites and one peridotite, which have olivine CPOs that might have developed under hydrous conditions, contain amphibole grains that were deformed in a fine-grained matrix, whereas the other peridotites, which have olivine CPOs that likely formed under anhydrous conditions, contain amphibole that grew after deformation.\nWe argue using evidence of spinel microboudinage within the ultramylonites that the olivine CPOs can be explained by low-temperature (low-T) plasticity caused by strain-hardening induced by higher stress toward the plastic-brittle transition under hydrous conditions in the final stage of deformation during uplift (and\/or cooling). The conditions of formation of these intensely deformed peridotites should replicate those in the principal transform slip zone and show that water-influenced high-temperature granulite-facies deformation must be occurring at depth within the main transform slip zone, with a consequent reduction in strength and viscosity.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nY.

It was followed by numerous events, including a M6.4 earthquake on April 15, at 00:03. These M6.5-class earthquakes, which were considered as foreshocks, involved a predominantly right-lateral strike slip. Eventually, on April 16, at 01:25, a M7.3 mainshock occurred on the Futagawa FZ that conjugated with the northern section of the Hinagu FZ, revealing a similar mechanism of fault motion as the M6.5-class foreshocks. The M7.3 mainshock started at the westernmost part of the Futagawa FZ, and its rupture propagated toward the east and terminated around Mt. Aso (Yagi et al., 2016). The Earthquake Research Committee (ERC) concluded that the Futagawa FZ and the northern section of the Hinagu FZ had been activated (ERC, 2016a). Over the first three years since the M7.3 mainshock (Fig. 1b), more than 27,000 aftershocks with M\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 occurred, including more than 100 events with M\u00a0\u2265\u00a04. The broader context of the Kumamoto earthquakes is that the Futagawa-Hinagu FZ is encompassed by the Beppu\u2013Shimabara graben, a geological formation that runs across the middle of Kyushu, from Beppu Bay in the east to the Shimabara Peninsula in the west (Inset of Fig. 1). This is understood as being the result of crustal deformation caused by the rifting and spreading of the Okinawa Trough, which is viewed as a continuation of the Beppu\u2013Shimabara graben (Tada, 1985).\nMonitoring crustal deformation and seismicity along the causative faults plays a role in understanding the process before and after major earthquakes. Numerical simulation and rock mechanics experiments suggested the occurrence of pre- and post-seismic slip transients. Some studies implied long-term precursory slip acceleration while other studies indicated a nucleation process that initially involves stable and slow rupture growth (Hori and Miyazaki, 2010; Yoshida and Kato, 2003; Dieterich, 1979; Lapusta et al., 2000). However, it is generally accepted that a precursory slip before a large earthquake is not always observed. This may be because this phenomenon does not always emerge in nature and\/or due to difficulty in observing a small slip. On the other hand, a post-seismic slip was observed for many earthquakes. In the aftermath of the Kumamoto earthquakes, slow deformation caused by a post-seismic slip of the causative Futagawa-Hinagu FZ, together with flow in the Earth's interior, has been detected by data from the GEONET: GNSS Earth Observation Network System (Moore et al., 2017; Pollitz et al., 2017).\nRecognizing earthquakes as foreshocks in real time would provide a valuable forecasting capability. However, decades of work have failed to establish a robust feature of individual foreshocks that distinguishes them from mainshocks or their aftershocks (Dascher-Cousineau et al., 2020). Foreshocks may be distinctive due to some precursory loading process or influence from the locked zone of the subsequent mainshock, neither of which will exist in the aftershock sequence (Brodsky and Lay, 2014). A fundamental question regarding the Kumamoto sequence is whether or not any indication of an impending large earthquake had appeared before the M7.3 mainshock. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) held a press conference after the M6.5 earthquake to warn of the possibility of large aftershocks with further damage. However, the JMA did not considered the occurrence of large earthquakes, according to the ERC (1998) protocol (see also ERC, 2016b), so no information was made public on the increased probability of M7 or larger earthquakes.\nIn a recent study, Gulia and Wiemer (2019) proposed a Foreshock Traffic-Light System (FTLS) that relies on abrupt changes in b-values of the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law (Gutenberg and Richter, 1944), relative to background values. The GR law is given as log10\nN\u00a0=\u00a0a\u2212bM, where a and b are constants, and N is the cumulative number of earthquakes with a magnitude larger than or equal to M. The approach utilizes high-resolution earthquake catalogs to monitor localized regions around the largest earthquakes and to distinguish foreshock sequences (reduced b-values) from aftershock sequences (increased b-values) (Gulia et al., 2020; Dascher-Cousineau et al., 2020). Evidence supporting the FTLS hypothesis emerged from investigating a timeseries of two sequences: the Norcia sequence in Italy and the Kumamoto sequence (Gulia and Wiemer, 2019). Their results of the Kumamoto case showed that b-values in the time interval between the M6.5 and M7.3 events first dropped from the background level and then increased over time, and that the b-values at the intermediate and ending times were below the background level, triggering a red traffic light (Table 1 of Gulia and Wiemer, 2019) and suggesting that seismicity in between was not considered as an aftershock sequence, rather as a foreshock one. Once the M7.3 mainshock occurred, b-values of the subsequent events increased strongly by 20\u201340%, triggering a green traffic light, suggesting that these events were aftershocks.\nWe first review our previous studies (Nanjo et al., 2016, 2019; Nanjo and Yoshida, 2017) that used the b-value of the GR law and the p-value of the Omori-Utsu (OU) law (Omori, 1894; Utsu, 1961) to explore the changes in seismicity before and after the Kumamoto mainshock. The OU law is given as \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0k(c\u00a0+\u00a0t)-p\n, where t is the time since the occurrence of a mainshock, \u03bb is the number of aftershocks per unit time at t with M greater than or equal to a cutoff magnitude, and c, k, and p are constants. The b-value is inversely proportional to differential stress (Scholz, 1968, 2015), and the p-value can be used to infer stressing history (Dieterich, 1994). The main conclusion is that local- and time-dependent variation in b- and p-values was linked with changes in stress state associated with aseismic slips and a coseismic one along the causative Futagawa-Hinagu FZ. Based on this review, we revisited the applicability of FTLS to the Kumamoto case and discuss the possibility of improving it.\n\n\n2\nA review of studies on b- and p-values associated with the Kumamoto earthquakes\nUnderstanding the stress state is of key importance for earthquake forecasting and hazard assessment. However, it is rather difficult to measure stress directly underground. Statistical parameters of seismicity might provide a useful way to monitor stress evolution on faults. Therefore, monitoring changes in seismicity pattern along a FZ plays an important role in understanding the process before and after major earthquakes. A set of three papers (Nanjo et al., 2016, 2019; Nanjo and Yoshida, 2017) conducted a systematic study on the seismicity associated with the entire process of the Kumamoto sequence.\nUsing earthquake data since 2000 from the JMA catalog, Nanjo et al. (2016) showed that seismicity before the start of the Kumamoto sequence revealed a zone of low b-values near the eventual epicenters of the M7.3 mainshock and two M6.5-class foreshocks (Fig. 2a). The precursory duration to the M7.3 mainshock was found to be unknown based on observation of an approximately constant b-value over the past 16\u00a0years (Nanjo et al., 2016). A decrease in b tracking stress buildup, as expected from a laboratory experiment (Scholz, 1968; Lei, 2003), might not be observable for the decade-scale observation of active faults, because it was too short to observe such a decrease in b for the Kumamoto case. The mechanism of stress buildup within a FZ is uncertain, but one hypothesis is that a steady slip of the deeper continuation of faults that does not produce earthquakes, but still involves motions across the fault, forces the upper crust around the faults to deform, and thus concentrate stress. The stress field remains difficult to measure directly (Narteau et al., 2009), but it would be helpful if some indirect evidence exists, such as stress inversion by a focal mechanism, or cases of stress buildup. A specific case includes thermally activated creep on major strike-slip faults such as the San Andreas Fault in California (Turcotte et al., 1980; Turcotte and Schurbert, 2002). These faults extend deep into the lithosphere, where they are likely to behave plastically, displaying a steady-state creep in deep fault zones.\nAssuming that the M6.5 foreshock was a mainshock, Nanjo and Yoshida (2017) showed that the OU law with p\u00a0>\u00a01 was correlated with seismic activity for the entire area during the period of 1.16\u00a0days between the M6.5 and M7.3 earthquakes. The same analysis was conducted to obtain p\u00a0>\u00a01 for the northern area (above 32.72\u00b0N) and p\u00a0<\u00a01 for the southern area (below 32.72\u00b0N), indicating rapid stress relaxation in the northern area, rather than in the southern one. The b-values significantly increased over time for the northern area (Fig. 2b), supported by the Utsu test (Utsu, 1999; Schorlemmer et al., 2004). An increase in b over time was observed for the southern area, but this increase was insignificant. The authors suggested that stress around the Futagawa FZ had begun to decrease preceding the M7.3 mainshock because they found a large p-value (p\u00a0>\u00a01) and a time-dependent increase in b for the northern area.\n\nNanjo and Yoshida (2017) also pointed out that earthquakes occurred near the hypocenter of the M7.3 mainshock in addition to most seismicity around the northern section of the Hinagu FZ. These events occurred later (0.98\u20130\u00a0days preceding the M7.3 mainshock). One explanation, based on Onaka (1993), may be that they were produced by a nucleation process of the M7.3 mainshock. This process is considered to be promoted by the gradual propagation of an aseismic slip (afterslip) toward the M7.3 hypocenter on and around the Hinagu FZ, interpreted from a detailed observation of seismicity migration starting immediately after the occurrence of the M6.5 earthquake and terminating at early times after this earthquake (Kato et al., 2016). The finding of the occurrence of earthquakes close to the M7.3 hypocenter at later times after the M6.5 earthquake implied the growth of a quasi-static preslip before the M7.3 mainshock. This preslip might have relaxed stress around the Futagawa FZ that hosted the forthcoming M7.3 mainshock. This stress relaxation provided feedback, causing a significantly larger p-value than p\u00a0=\u00a01 and a significant increase in the b-value (Fig. 2b) in the northern area, including a part of the Futagawa FZ. This relaxation was also inferred from the result of a stress inversion analysis performed by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (2016) that suggested the reduction in normal stress at the Futagawa FZ, i.e., a decrease in compressive stress on the fault. It was considered that afterslip of the M6.5 earthquake was not the main cause of the observed change in seismicity, but might set up the conditions that allowed this change in seismicity. This is because a detailed observation (Kato et al., 2016) showed that the afterslip occurred only on and around the Hinagu FZ while the major slip was limited to an early period after the M6.5 event.\n\nNanjo et al. (2019) considered the sequence after the M7.3 mainshock until March 2019 to show an area of low b-values at the southern end of the large (M\u00a0\u2265\u00a05) earthquakes during the period from the start of the Kumamoto sequence (Fig. 2c). To obtain this result of b-values, the period from immediately after the M7.3 mainshock to the end of 2016 was not considered to remove the effect of the main aftershock sequence that revealed strong temporal variability in b. A comparison between the b values before the start of the Kumamoto sequence (Fig. 2a) and those on and after 2017 (Fig. 2c) showed a significant increase in b-values in most areas along the Futagawa-Hinagu FZ, expected by a release of stress. However, there was an exceptional area showing a decrease in b, which coincided with the area of low b-values (Fig. 2c). This was interpreted as an indication of overall stress release with a local region of increasing stress. The OU law was found to be applicable to the post-M7.3-quake sequence. This law assumed p\u00a0>\u00a01 (fast decay) along the Futagawa FZ and the northern section of the Hinagu FZ and p\u00a0<\u00a01 (slow decay) along the southern section of the Hinagu FZ, with intermediate values (p\u00a0~\u00a01) near the boundary between the northern and southern sections of the Hinagu FZ. This boundary corresponded to the area of low and decreasing b-values.\nThe observation of Nanjo et al. (2019) was explained by a postseismic deformation model with afterslip on the causative faults and viscoelastic relaxation associated with the Beppu-Shimabara graben (Pollitz et al., 2017). Afterslip on the Futagawa FZ and the northern section of the Hinagu FZ, causing a rapid stress decrease, explained large p-values (p\u00a0>\u00a01) and an increase in b-value. Viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust and mantle that dominated at a greater distance where the southern section of the Hinagu FZ was involved, caused a gradual decrease in stress, resulting in small p-values (p\u00a0<\u00a01) and again an increase in b-values. The afterslip on the northern section of the Hinagu FZ, in contrast to the lack of afterslip on the southern section of the same FZ, might lead to a constant or even an increase in local stress at the boundary between the northern and southern sections. This explained a decrease in b-values at this boundary, and also explained an intermediate p-value (p\u00a0~\u00a01) there, taking into consideration a model for seismicity rate resulting from stressing history (Fig. 8 of Dieterich, 1994).\n\n\n3\nMethod and data\nTo estimate b-values consistently over space and time (Figs. 3 and 4\n\n), we employed the EMR (entire-magnitude range) technique (Woessner and Wiemer, 2005), which also simultaneously calculates the completeness magnitude M\nc, above which all events can be detected by a seismic network. EMR applies the maximum-likelihood method to compute the b-value to events with a magnitude above M\nc. Uncertainties in b were computed by bootstrapping (Schorlemmer et al., 2003). If logP\nb, the logarithm of the probability that the b-values are not different, is equal to or smaller than \u22121.3 (logP\nb\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u22121.3), then the change in b is significant (Utsu, 1999; Schorlemmer et al., 2004). Spatiotemporal changes in b are known to reflect a state of stress in the Earth's crust (Narteau et al., 2009; Schorlemmer et al., 2005; Scholz, 2015). Patches with small b-values on active faults have been observed to coincide with locations of subsequent large earthquakes (Nanjo, 2020; Schorlemmer and Wiemer, 2005; Tormann et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2021). Investigations using b-values have been applied to locate asperities and to estimate frictional properties on the plate interface along subduction zones (e.g. Ghosh et al., 2008; Nanjo et al., 2012; Nanjo and Yoshida, 2018; Sobiesiak et al., 2007; Schurr et al., 2014; Tormann et al., 2015). The results of laboratory experiments indicate a systematic decrease in the b-value approaching the time of the entire fracture (Lei, 2003; Scholz, 1968). Foreshocks have been known to show small b-values (Gulia and Wiemer, 2019; Gulia et al., 2020; Dascher-Cousineau et al., 2020).\nOur dataset was the earthquake catalog maintained by the JMA. We used about 106 earthquakes having M\u00a0\u2265\u00a00 during the period from January 1, 2000 to March 11, 2019 with depths shallower than 25\u00a0km within the study region (Fig. 1). This period is the same as that considered for a previous paper (Nanjo et al., 2019), and subsets of that period in two other papers (Nanjo et al., 2016; Nanjo and Yoshida, 2017). A b-value analysis is critically dependent on a robust estimate of completeness of the processed earthquake data. In particular, underestimates of M\nc lead to systematic underestimates of b-values. We always paid attention to M\nc when assessing M\nc at each node and time window. As shown in other studies using the JMA catalog (Nanjo et al., 2010; Schorlemmer et al., 2018), typical values for M\nc are presently 0.5\u20131 in the Kyushu district that includes the Kumamoto region. Small earthquakes in the early stage after a large event are, in many cases, missing from the earthquake catalogs, as they are \u201cmasked\u201d by the coda of the large event and overlapped with each other on the seismograms. According to Nanjo and Yoshida (2017) who showed time-dependent decrease of M\nc during the period between the M6.5 and M7.3 quakes, we examined a M\nc-time pattern (Fig. 4).\n\n\n4\nResults and discussion\nA review of previous studies (Nanjo et al., 2016, 2019; Nanjo and Yoshida, 2017) indicates a systematic investigation into the seismicity before, during, and after the Kumamoto earthquakes that started in April of 2016, by analyzing the b- and p-values (Section 2). A brief summary is as follows: (1) the focal areas of the M\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 earthquakes were more stressed than others before the start of the Kumamoto sequence; thereafter, stress generally decreased along the causative faults, as inferred from the spatial distribution of b- and p-values. (2) By using a more detailed analysis, the two statistical parameters suggested aseismic preslip and afterslip along the causative faults. The preslip locally reduced stress just prior to the largest earthquake near its epicenter.\nUsing the idea of the FTLS, analysis of b-values for seismicity during the time interval between the M6.5 and M7.3 earthquakes (Fig. 2b), in contrast to b-values for seismicity before the M6.5 earthquake (Fig. 2a), implied a yellow FTLS status for the southern area that included a part of the Hinagu FZ and a green FTLS status for the northern area that included a part of the Futagawa FZ hosting the eventual M7.3 earthquake. Here, we examined the inconsistency with the result obtained by Gulia and Wiemer (2019), who showed that a red traffic light was triggered before the M7.3 mainshock for the purpose of improving the FTLS.\n\nFig. 2 shows map views of b-values based on seismicity (a) before the M6.5 events, (b) during the period between the M6.5 and M7.3 events (top panel: period 1.16\u20130.98\u00a0days prior to the M7.3 events; bottom panel: period 0.98\u20130\u00a0days), and (c) after the M7.3 events, reproduced from Nanjo et al. (2016, 2019) and Nanjo and Yoshida (2017). The mapping procedures were the same as those for these studies, but using a unified color code among the maps of b-values for ease of visual comparison. The inset of Fig. 2b is a map of log P\nb, the logarithm of the probability that the b values for the two periods, 1.16\u20130.98\u00a0days (top panel) and 0.98\u20130\u00a0days (bottom panel) prior to the M7.3 quake are not different, again a reproduction from Nanjo and Yoshida (2017). A general trend of the time-dependent increase in b in the interval between the M6.5 and M7.3 events, which had been shown by Gulia and Wiemer (2019), was also found in Fig. 2b. However, if we considered the southern and northern areas separately, our analysis of b-values confirmed a yellow FTLS status for the former area and a green FTLS status for the latter area. For the northern area, which includes a part of the Futagawa FZ on which the impending M7.3 mainshock occurred, b-values showed an increase over time, to values exceeding 1.0 (bottom panel of Fig. 2b), significantly larger than the background levels (b\u00a0=\u00a00.81\u20130.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u20130.07) found by Gulia and Wiemer (2019) and those (b\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u20130.8) in the area of the M6.5 and M7.3 epicenters (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, for the southern area, which includes a part of the northern section of the Hinagu FZ on which the M6.5 foreshock had already occurred, b-values were similar to the background level.\nThe earthquake samples for b-value estimation in a grid search (Fig. 2) might contain events from different faults, which might cause possible bias as the b-value varies in different fault regimes. The M7.3 mainshock and two M6.5-class foreshocks belong to two different fault systems. To eliminate doubts about this bias, we conducted a b-value timeseries analysis (Fig. 3) based on events in two regions that do not overlap with each other: one region (blue) includes only a part of the Hinagu FZ, and the other (red) includes only a part of the Futagawa FZ. In the latter region, an area close to the M7.3 mainshock epicenter was not included, because it was difficult to distinguish between events from the Hinagu FZ and events from the Futagawa FZ. Fig. 4 shows the time dependence of M\nc, confirming Nanjo and Yoshida (2017), where M\nc was simultaneously calculated when applying the EMR method for obtaining the b-value. In creating Figs. 3 and 4, we used a moving window approach, whereby the window covered 80 events, and plotted b and M\nc at the end of the moving window that they represent. For both regions (Fig. 3), the b-values were typically 0.6\u20130.8 before the M6.5 earthquake, where these values have been relatively stable since 2015, as shown in Fig. 3c. The b-values showed a rapid decrease just after the M6.5 earthquake, to values below 0.5. A transition to increase in b occurred after this decrease. The b-values at 0.3 to 0\u00a0days relative to the M7.3 mainshock were above the background pre-M6.5-quake levels for the red region, while those at 0.8 to 0\u00a0days were around b\u00a0=\u00a00.8 for the blue region, not yet considered higher than the background values. The difference between the change in b-values for the region, including a part of the Futagawa FZ, and for that including a part of the Hinagu FZ is clear. The result supports our implication of a yellow FTLS status for the Hinagu FZ and a green FTLS status for the Futagawa FZ.\nOur results for the northern area (indicative of a green FTLS status) suggested a scenario of a reduction in stress induced by growth of aseismic preslip on the Futagawa FZ, as discussed in Section 2 (also see Nanjo and Yoshida, 2017), subsequently leading to a much larger chance of a stronger M7.3 event. The results by Gulia and Wiemer (2019) (indicative of a red FTLS status) suggested an alternative scenario in which stress on the Futagawa FZ increased, leading to a subsequently much larger chance of a stronger M7.3 event. The discrepancy between our study and the Gulia and Wiemer (2019) study is that the former study investigated spatial variation of b-values, allowing us to find clues of preslip on the nearby Futagawa FZ, which were not found by the latter study. The Kumamoto case might not be a good application of the FTLS.\nThe picture changes markedly after the M7.3 mainshock: the b-values in the Kumamoto source area that largely fluctuated during the first several months (Fig. 3c), increased significantly, compared with the background (also see Section 2 and Nanjo et al., 2019). This is consistent with the findings by Gulia and Wiemer (2019), who suggested that the chance of a subsequent large event was substantially small, although the Kumamoto aftershock sequence included many small events. No subsequent large event has occurred so far.\nThe FTLS system is quite new, and some cases, except for the Kumamoto one, would provide support for it. We agree with Gulia et al. (2020) that it is too early to use the current version of the FTLS routinely for making decisions about civil protection and public communications. More extensive tests of sensitivity and robustness are needed, as pointed out by those authors. Based on our studies, it would be very worthwhile to improve the FTLS in ways that would allow spatial variability of b-values to be taken into consideration, and if an indication of preslip appeared, this would trigger a red traffic light. Also, the problem may be a lack of another type of sensitivity, namely only 3 levels of sensitivity, red, yellow and green. Perhaps a wider range of sensitivities would be more useful, but then the name would likely have to change to something other than the FTLS, since traffic lights do not have more than 3 colors.\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nThis paper reviewed previous studies on spatial and temporal patterns of seismicity in the Kumamoto region, in Japan, where some large earthquakes took place in 2016, including one with M7.3 (Nanjo et al., 2016, 2019; Nanjo and Yoshida, 2017). Based on stress-dependent laws of statistical seismology, the stress evolution during this earthquake sequence could be illustrated. Based on the outcomes, we provided additional insight into the FTLS (Gulia and Wiemer, 2019).\nUsing the b-value of the GR frequency-magnitude law and the p-value of the OU aftershock-decay law, it was shown that a zone of low b-values (indicative of high stress) lay near the eventual epicenters of the M6.5 and M7.3 earthquakes before the start of the Kumamoto sequence, and that after it, the overall trend in stress decreased along the Futagawa-Hinagu FZ. Detailed analysis suggested aseismic preslips and afterslips along the causative FZ. Stress reduction just prior to the M7.3 mainshock near its epicenter was suggested to be locally induced by preslips. Based on the review and our new results, we noted that the observed b-values were indicative of a green FTLS status before the M7.3 event, in contrast to a red FTLS status shown by Gulia and Wiemer (2019), who did not study spatial variability of b-values to help detect aseismic preslips that occurred locally on the Futagawa FZ. In our view, taking this b-value variability into account, together with using other seismological and geological information such as p-values and the spatial configuration of active faults, is important to improve the FTLS.

While geophysical approaches are strongly limited to present-day conditions, the modelling approach has the advantage to demonstrate rifting processes over a wide temporal and spatial extent. In the case of experimental modelling techniques (Overview in review article from Corti (2012)), examples of such temporal and spatial evolution are inward migration of faulting (as the result of progressive extension in narrow rifts), fault linkage and rift interaction as well as rift propagation.\nInward rift migration describes the process of progressive narrowing of tectonic activity towards the rift axis. In this process, tectonic activity and related basin subsidence move from large boundary faults inwards to intra-rift faults where subsidence results in second generation intra-rift subbasins (e.g., Agostini et al., 2009; Corti, 2012; Corti et al., 2013; Corti et al., 2010; Ebinger, 2005). Inward rift migration represents a temporal strain partitioning between early boundary faults and late stage intra-rift faults (Ebinger, 2005).\nOther modelling studies have investigated lateral fault growth and fault linkage (e.g., Bellahsen et al., 2003a; Bellahsen and Daniel, 2005; Schlagenhauf et al., 2008) as well as rift segment linkage structures (e.g., Allken et al., 2011, 2012; Brune, 2014; Brune et al., 2017; Corti et al., 2019; Glerum et al., 2020; Koehn et al., 2008; Zwaan and Schreurs, 2017, 2020; Zwaan et al., 2016). In addition, analogue modelling studies have investigated vertical fault growth and fault linkage in brittle-ductile strata (e.g., Gabrielsen et al., 2016; Gabrielsen et al., 2019; Vasquez et al., 2018).\nFor quantifying fault growth, attempts have been made in the past based on the geometric relation between fault length and maximum displacement (see Walsh and Watterson, 1988; Watterson, 1986). However, such a model lacks kinematic considerations on how faults grow over time in length and accumulate displacement (Walsh et al., 2002). More recently, two coexisting conceptual models suggest fault growth by either (1) linear growth in which fault length and displacement synchronously accumulate by fault linkage and propagation (i.e., propagating model; Cartwright et al., 1995; Walsh and Watterson, 1988; Watterson, 1986) or (2) by an initial phase of rapid propagation followed by a longer phase of displacement accumulation along at near constant fault length (i.e., constant length model; Jackson and Rotevatn, 2013; Nicol et al., 2005; Rotevatn et al., 2019; Schlagenhauf et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2002). Rotevatn et al. (2019) consider the propagating, and the constant length models to be end members and suggest a hybrid fault growth model in which initial rapid fault lengthening occurs by fault linkage and lengthening followed by a stage of constant length displacement accumulation. Indeed, the kinematic interaction of fault segments and its importance for effective rift propagation has been discussed in numerous studies (e.g., Morley et al., 1990; Morley, 1999; Nelson et al., 1992; Schlische, 1992). In early stages of rifting, the rift boundary faults rapidly grow laterally by linkage of numerous small faults. After the early lateral fault growth, the boundary faults focus on fault displacement accumulation generating tectonic subsidence in the longitudinally continuous rift.\nAlthough conceptual fault growth models may be supported by observations from modelling studies using orthogonal extension (Bellahsen et al., 2003a; Schlagenhauf et al., 2008), fault growth under rotational extension has not yet been studied in similar detail. Therefore, it remains unclear how individual fault segments in rotational settings accumulate strain and how a gradient in divergence velocity does influence fault linkage contributing to the propagation of the entire rift system.\nTo answer these questions, we present 3D analogue models of continental rifting in rotational systems on a crustal scale and analyse fault growth and rift propagation at different divergence velocities. We apply 3D stereo Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for the quantitative analysis of the surface deformation in 3D. In addition, X-ray computed tomography is used to qualitatively analyse internal model deformation and fault evolution. By a combination of novel imaging techniques to capture surface deformation and a detailed quantification analysis of individual structures we present novel insights on crustal scale deformation in rifts with an along-strike divergence velocity gradient.\n\n\n2\nNatural examples and analogue models of plate rotation\nAlthough various modelling studies use constant divergence velocities along the strike of a rift system to examine propagating rifts (e.g., Le Pourhiet et al., 2018; Michon and Merle, 2000; Van Wijk and Blackman, 2005), in nature often significant velocity gradients occur along the strike of diverging plate boundaries because of their rotational plate motion around a vertical rotation pole (Euler pole; Martin, 1984; Smith, 1993).\nNumerous rotational rift settings have been proposed for example for the Red Sea (e.g., Bonatti, 1985; Souriot and Brun, 1992) and the Gulf of Aden region because of a counter clockwise rotation of the Arabian plate (e.g., Bellahsen et al., 2003b). In the Laptev Sea, the Gakkel Ridge forms a symmetric spreading ocean ridge, where spreading rates gradually decrease towards the present-day rotation pole near the coast of the Laptev Sea (Dick et al., 2003; Sekretov, 2001; Van Wijk and Blackman, 2005). Another setting in which rotational basin opening has been proposed is the aligned Rockall Trough, Faeroe Basin and M\u00f8re Basin in the Northeast Atlantic (e.g., Dor\u00e9 et al., 1999; Hanisch, 1984; Lundin and Dor\u00e9, 1997). More illustrative compilations of rift settings with rotational extension are given in Zwaan and Schreurs (2020) and Zwaan et al. (2020).\nIn the case of back-arc extension, subduction slab retreat velocity may vary along the trench resulting in asymmetrical spreading and a block rotation component (e.g., Schellart et al., 2002; Wallace et al., 2009; Wallace et al., 2005). A spectacular example of this process can be found in the Southern Rhodope Core complex in the Aegean, where southward retreat of the Hellenic subduction zone resulted in a regional clockwise rotation up to 50\u00b0-60\u00b0 around a pole located at Scutary-Pec, Albania (Brun and Sokoutis, 2010) and triggered the exhumation of the triangular shaped Southern Rhodope Core Complex (SRCC; Brun and Sokoutis, 2007). Analogue models with boundary conditions adapted to the Aegean back-arc extension provide first-order explanation of the mechanical evolution of the Rhodope core complexes (e.g., Kydonakis et al., 2015; Philippon et al., 2014).\nOther analogue modelling studies of asymmetric back-arc extension that involve block rotation investigated the Tonga-Kermadec arc system in the Southwest Pacific (Schellart et al., 2002), the Kuril Basin in the Northwest Pacific (Schellart et al., 2003), or the Havre Trough near the southern Kermadec Trench (Benes and Scott, 1996). In the latter case, the rift propagates from the Southern Havre Trough into the continental lithosphere at the northern margin of New Zealand forming the Taupo Rift Zone (Fig. 1\n). The Taupo rift provides an excellent recent natural example of rotational opening due to its juvenile rift stage and high extension rates (e.g., Villamor et al., 2017). East of the North Island, the Pacific plate is subducted under the Australian plate along the Hikurangi Trough. Further to the south, the collision of the Chatham Rise (a buoyant continental fragment) with the Hikurangi Trough eventually ceases subduction and exerts a torque on the crustal blocks leading to a clockwise tectonic block rotation around a vertical rotation pole near the Chatham Rise (e.g., Nicol and Wallace, 2007; Wallace et al., 2004; Wallace et al., 2009; Wallace et al., 2005; Fig. 1 inset).\nMost recent analogue modelling studies of rotational rifting intensively investigated the interaction of propagating rifts and linear mantle heterogeneities (Molnar et al., 2017; Molnar et al., 2019) and their role in forming microcontinents (Molnar et al., 2018). Subsequently, Khalil et al. (2020) used more complex heterogeneities to investigate rifting in the Afar region. At crustal scale, Maestrelli et al. (2020) examined the interaction of propagating rifts and pre-existing brittle crustal fabrics. Furthermore, Zwaan and Schreurs (2020) analysed rift interaction of linear crustal weaknesses as a function of rift underlap and compared their findings with models of orthogonal extension.\nAlthough the abovementioned recent modelling studies improve our understanding of overall rift propagation in rotational settings, a detailed and quantitative analysis of fault growth is missing. Therefore, the crustal-scale models presented here focus on a spatially and temporally high resolution analysis on individual fault growth which ultimately controls rift propagation in a rotational rift setting.\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nExperimental apparatus\nOur experimental machine simulates rotational extension and has been used and described in previous studies by Zwaan and Schreurs (2020) and Zwaan et al. (2020). For the sake of completeness, we briefly describe the modelling approach here. The model setup is confined by two short, curved sidewalls and long mobile sidewalls (Fig. 2\n). The two mobile sidewalls are pivoting around a vertical rotation axis separating the model box into a 65\u00a0cm long extensional and 25\u00a0cm long contractional domain, respectively (Fig. 2a,b). The applied divergence velocity is defined by the opening of the distant circular segment in the extensional domain and linearly decreases towards the rotation axis. Hence, no deformation occurs at the rotation axis and largest deformation occurs at distant model parts. Subsequently, we use the terms distal and proximal to refer to rift-axis parallel deformation in the extensional domain further away and closer to the rotation axis, respectively. Fig. 3\n shows extension and shortening in our model box as a function of time and distance to the rotation pole. Assuming no deformation localization, (i.e., no heterogeneities) this can be used as a proxy for model deformation. Note, that stretching and shortening are not linear over time and space.\nThe initial model area is defined by a quasi-rectangular surface with gently curved, short side walls with a maximum length of 90\u00a0cm along the central axis and a width of 31\u00a0cm. For our analyses, we leave out the outermost, curved model parts resulting in a rectangular area of interest of about 80 by 31\u00a0cm. The model sits on top of a 5\u00a0cm thick foam base which is initially compressed between the longitudinal sidewalls. Rotational movement results in stretching of the foam below the extensional domain and further shortening of the foam below the contractional domain. To prevent the model from sinking in, the foam base is supported by vertical plexiglass bars (Fig. 2d). Therefore, the basal model boundary does not accommodate for isostatic contribution from the mantle. However, our models focus on crustal deformation which, in return, allows for a better spatial resolution necessary for our analyses. To ensure that the brittle cover is decoupled from the base setup by the viscous layer (i.e., excluding potential boundary effects due to the basal setup), we run 2D DIC analyses on surface top view images of the basal setup (supplementary fig. S1).\n\n\n3.2\nAnalogue model setup\nThe two-layer model consists of a brittle-viscous set up with a brittle layer sitting on top of a viscous layer. The brittle layer simulates the upper crust, whereas the viscous layer simulates the ductile lower crust (Fig. 2c). To localise rifting within the brittle layer, we apply \u201cseeds\u201d (semi-cylindrical PDMS\/corundum sand mixture rods with radius of ca. 0.5\u00a0cm) along the entire model length on top of the viscous mixture. These seeds act as an inherited heterogeneity and have been successfully implemented in analogue models of previous rifting studies (e.g., Molnar et al., 2020; Zwaan and Schreurs, 2020; Zwaan et al., 2019; Zwaan et al., 2020). The rift location can be controlled by a reactivation of pre-existing weaknesses or basement fabric (e.g., Collanega et al., 2018; Corti, 2012; Heilman et al., 2019; Seebeck et al., 2014). In this light, our seed is a structural weakness that can become reactivated allowing the rift to develop and propagate preferentially above it. For visual aid, a fine 4 by 4\u00a0cm grid of corundum sand is sieved on the model surface prior to the model run whereas random patterns of coffee powder sprinkled on the surface act as passive markers facilitating further quantitative DIC analysis.\nWe focus at the documentation and deformation analysis on a reference model with an overall thickness of 6\u00a0cm, representing a 30\u00a0km thick continental crust, with a brittle-ductile ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a01 and an applied maximum divergence velocity of 10\u00a0mm\/h (i.e., the divergence velocity furthest away from the rotation axis), similar to the initial setup used in Zwaan et al. (2020). However, in order to check the robustness of our findings and interpretation, we conduct a series of analogue models in which we systematically change divergence velocities to investigate the influence of different extension rates on rift propagation and fault growth (Fig. 2,c). In addition, different divergence velocities are applied in models with two different thickness ratios RBD to simulate different initial crustal configurations. Namely, RBD\u00a0=\u00a01 and RBD\u00a0=\u00a03, representing intermediate (models Mod_1_xx) to high (models Mod_3_xx) crustal strength respectively, in a stable cratonic lithosphere dominated by brittle deformation. Note that \u201cxx\u201d denotes the applied maximum divergence velocity. In total we run a series of nine models of which six models examine the abovementioned parameters. In addition, we re-run models using the reference setup of model Mod_1_10 for CT scans (Mod_1_10_CT) and a model excluding the contractional domain (Mod_1_10_EXT). Additionally, we run a model with a brittle ductile ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a02 (Mod_2_10). All models are listed in.\nFor our reference experiment (hereafter Mod_1_10), the mobile sidewalls open with a maximum divergence velocity of 10\u00a0mm\/h (symmetrically 5\u00a0mm\/h each side), linearly decreasing towards the rotation axis. After a total run time of four hours, this results in a maximum extension of 40\u00a0mm or about 13% maximum extension. Similarly, maximum shortening of 15.4\u00a0mm or 5% is reached at the final stage at the distant circular segment in the contractional domain. We double the maximum divergence velocity to 20\u00a0mm\/h (10\u00a0mm\/h on each side; models Mod_1_20 and Mod_3_20) and further increase it to 40\u00a0mm\/h (20\u00a0mm\/h on each side; models Mod_1_40 and Mod_3_40) to subsequently increase the lower ductile crustal strength and enhance brittle-ductile coupling. We keep the amount of bulk extension similar by changing the model run time from 4\u00a0h (Mod_1_10 and Mod_3_10) to 2\u00a0h (Mod_1_20 and Mod_3_20) and 1\u00a0h (Mod_1_40 and Mod_3_40) to compare all models.\n\n\n3.3\nAnalogue material\nFor the viscous basal layer, we use a mixture of corundum sand and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with a mixing ratio 1:1. The mixture has a density of 1600\u00a0kg\/m3 and a viscosity of ca 1.5\u00b7105\u00a0Pa\u00a0s with a quasi-linear stress exponent of 1.05 (Zwaan et al., 2018). As an analogue for the upper brittle crust, we use dry loose quartz sand with a bulk density Table 1\n of 1560\u00a0kg\/m3. This density is achieved by sieving sand into the model box from a height of 30\u00a0cm. Thus, a proper density gradient is assured to avoid density driven upwelling of the viscous mixture. During the experiment, localised deformation in the quartz sand layer locally lowers the initial friction coefficient. This strain softening is quantified as the difference between the coefficient of peak friction and dynamic friction coefficient divided by the reactivation friction coefficient (Panien et al., 2006) from mutual two-point regression analysis. For quartz and corundum sands, strain softening values are 16% and 18%, respectively and are derived from friction coefficients in Schmid et al. (2020a, 2020b).\nFor a CT scanned experiment, we add small quantities (weight ratio 1:50) of Zirshot ceramic microbeads to the quartz and corundum sands to enhance volumetric patterns on CT scans to facilitate DVC analysis (Adam et al., 2013). In addition, a 1\u00a0mm thin layer of corundum sand is sieved from 30\u00a0cm height on top of the viscous mixture before adding quartz sand to enhance the X-ray absorption contrast between the viscous and brittle domain. The influence of the ceramic microbeads and the thin corundum sand layer on the overall mechanical properties is minor and can be neglected (Klinkm\u00fcller, 2011; Panien et al., 2006; Schmid et al., 2020a). All relevant material properties are summarized in Table 2\n.\n\n\n3.4\nScaling\nIn order to ensure proper scaling of our models up to natural scales we apply the standard equations based on Hubbert (1937) and Ramberg (1981). For brittle Mohr-Coulomb type materials dynamic similarity is given by the equation for stress ratios\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n\u03c1\n\u2217\n\n\ng\n\u2217\n\n\nh\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n\nBy convention, \u03c3\n\u2217 is defined as:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\nm\n\n\/\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n\nwhere m and n represent model and nature, respectively. Further, \u03c1\n\u2217, g\n\u2217 and h\n\u2217 represent the density, gravity, and length ratios, respectively. Our reference setup yields a geometric scaling factor of h\n\u2217\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u22126, a density scaling factor of \u03c1\n\u2217\u00a0=\u00a00.58, and a gravity scaling factor of 1, resulting in a stress scaling factor of \u03c3\n\u2217\u00a0=\u00a010\u22126. With a cohesion around 50\u00a0Pa and 50\u00a0MPa for our quartz sand and upper crustal rocks (Byerlee, 1978) respectively, the cohesion scaling factor is c\n\u2217\u00a0=\u00a010\u22126.\nThe strain-rate ratio \n\n\n\u03f5\n\u0307\n\n\u2217\n\n=\n8\n\u2217\n\n10\n9\n\n for viscous materials is obtained from the stress ratio \u03c3\n\u2217and the viscosity ratio \u03b7\n\u2217\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u221216 (Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03f5\n\u0307\n\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\u2217\n\n\/\n\n\u03b7\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the velocity ratio v\n\u2217 and the time ratio t\n\u2217 are calculated with\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03f5\n\u0307\n\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n\nv\n\u2217\n\n\nh\n\u2217\n\n\n=\n\n1\n\nt\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\nwith a velocity scaling ratio v\n\u2217\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0\u2217\u00a0104 and a time ratio t\n\u2217\u00a0=\u00a010\u221210.\nBased on our scaling, 1\u00a0cm in our experiments corresponds to 5\u00a0km in nature. For an intermediate lower crustal viscosity of \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a01021 Pa s (Zwaan et al., 2019 and references therein), one hour in our analogue experiments translates to about 0.88\u00a0Ma in nature and the reference extension velocity (10\u00a0mm\/\u00a0h) converts to a velocity of 5\u20136\u00a0mm a\u22121 and strain-rate values of 6 10\u221215 s\u22121 in nature, close to typical values for initial continental rifting (Zwaan et al., 2019). Our experiments cover strain rates varying by a factor of 4 (5\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u22125 s\u22121 - 2\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u22124 s\u22121), which translates to a variation by a factor of about 3 in nature (6\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u221215 s\u22121 - 2\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u221214 s\u22121).\nFor verifying dynamic similarity of brittle natural and experiment material we calculate the Smoluchowski number Sm, which is the ratio between gravitational stress and cohesive strength (Ramberg, 1981):\n\n(5)\n\n\nS\nm\n\n=\n\n\u03c1gh\n\nC\n+\n\u03bc\u03c1gh\n\n\n\n\nwhere , h, C and \u03bc are the density, thickness, cohesion, and friction coefficient, respectively of the brittle material. With a cohesion of 50\u00a0MPa and friction coefficient of ca 0.6 (Byerlee, 1978) for upper crustal rocks, this yields a Sm around 1 for our models as well as for nature. We further calculate the Ramberg number R\n\nm\n to ensure dynamic and kinematic similarities between the viscous layers.\n\n(6)\n\n\nR\nm\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c1g\n\nh\n2\n\n\n\u03b7v\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the reference velocity, this yields a Ramberg number of 34 and 36 for our models and nature, respectively. The Reynolds number R\n\ne\n is defined as the ratio between inertial forces to viscous forces and is for all our models as well as for the natural prototypes << 1:\n\n(7)\n\n\nR\ne\n\n=\n\n\u03c1vh\n\u03b7\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, that we use the maximum extension velocity (i.e. the velocity furthest away from the rotation axis) for calculating R\n\nm\n and R\n\ne\n. In most parts of our experiments, however, velocities are smaller due to the velocity gradient. While R\n\ne\n\u00a0<\u00a0< 1 remains valid for the entire extensional domain, R\n\nm\n increases with decreasing velocities towards the rotation axis. In the middle of the extensional domain, Rm is around 68 while halving the velocity yields a Ramberg number of about 71 for nature. However, the ratio between model and nature Ramberg number remains close to 1 within the entire velocity range. Based on the applied scaling laws, the material properties and the similar non-dimensional numbers for model and nature, we consider the reference model to be properly dynamically scaled. Reference model parameters and dynamic numbers of the used materials are specified in Table 3\n. Note that for varying divergence velocities and brittle ductile ratios scaling factors and dynamic numbers change. However, changes are minor, and we consider them to be negligible.\n\n\n3.5\nDeformation monitoring\nWe use a customised automated light and camera setup as shown in Fig. 4\n with selectable image interval allowing us to take images for qualitative top view analysis as well as stereo images for 3D surface and displacement analysis by means of 3D stereo DIC (Adam et al., 2005). The surface evolution is captured with time-series images by three DSLR cameras in 60\u00a0s intervals. A Nikon D200 (10.2 Mpx) is used for top view images and two Nikon D810 (36 Mpx) cameras in stereoscopic setup, are used for 3D surface deformation monitoring. All cameras are aligned above the model surface with the top view camera in middle position above the model centre and two cameras with an inclination angle of ca. 30 degrees with respect to each other for stereoscopic images. Two LED light sources with a colour temperature of 4000\u00a0K illuminate the model surface from two opposing sides to avoid shadow casting. For top view images, however, only one light source is active to enhance visibility of surface deformation structures. In order to switch automatically between these two light settings, a digital timer controls one LED light source in a 30\u00a0s on\/off cycle. The top view camera is automatically controlled and passes its image trigger signal onto a programmable ESPER TriggerBox that retains the signal for 30\u00a0s before transferring it to the stereoscopic camera setup. This delay is necessary to change light settings. Hence, images are sequentially taken every 60\u00a0s but with a shift of 30\u00a0s between top view and stereoscopic images.\nFor recording model internal deformation, we rerun our reference model Mod_1_10 in a medical XRCT scanner (64 slice Siemens Somatom Definition AS X-ray CT-scanner), hereafter called Mod_1_10_CT. This model is scanned at 20\u00a0min interval (every 3.3\u00a0mm of maximum extension or 1% extension) for a total experiment duration of 240\u00a0min. In addition, rerunning Mod_1_10 with identical setup allows to assess experimental reproducibility. The scan resolution is 512 by 512 pixels for each slice with a scan window of 37 by 37\u00a0cm. The applied scan protocol is resource intensive and consequently we limit the scan area to a horizontal 68 by 31\u00a0cm rectangle (Fig. 2b).\n\n\n3.6\nData analysis and post processing\nTools and techniques to quantify deformation in analogue models have greatly improved in the last decades. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a non-destructive method for quantitative deformation analysis, which has been successfully applied for high-resolution analysis of 2D, 3D surface and 3D volume analysis of localised and diffuse deformation in analogue experiments (Adam et al., 2013; Adam et al., 2005; Zwaan et al., 2017). 2D DIC using a single camera (map or profile view) to compute 2D displacements and strain fields is a widespread technique applied on analogue models of tectonic processes (Schellart and Strak, 2016) and free software MATLAB toolboxes are available for analysis (e.g., Boutelier, 2016; Boutelier et al., 2019; Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014). More advanced commercial software makes it possible to use stereoscopic camera arrangements and directly compute the 3D topography and 3D displacement vector field of the deforming experiment surface (e.g., 3D Stereo Digital Image Correlation (DIC); Adam et al. (2005)).\n\n3.6.1\n3D Stereo Digital Image Correlation (3D Stereo DIC)\nHere, we use the StrainMaster module from the commercial DaVis image correlation software (version 8.4, LaVision). This method combines stereoscopic DIC techniques with volume mapping to quantify the 3D surface topography and respective 3D displacement fields from time-series stereo images (Adam et al., 2005; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007). This workflow includes 3D volume calibration (camera calibration and mapping function for image correction and surface height), static measurement of the surface shape (scalar field calculation from stereo image pairs for topography based on mapping function M\u2032), and dynamic measurement of 3D surface deformation (calculation of 3D displacement field on surface from time-series stereo images). For displacement calculation, DaVis uses a least square matching algorithm with adaptive multi-pass cross-correlation. For local displacement calculations we utilise subsets (interrogation windows) of 31 by 31 pixels with a 75% overlap. The analysed model areas consist of ca. 6500 by 2500 pixels for the x- and y-axis, respectively with an average volume calibration misfit of ca. 0.6 pixels. With an average pixel size of ca. 0.1\u00a0mm, volume calibration yields absolute residual fit errors of about 0.06\u00a0mm. For topography and displacement field calculations the average reconstruction error is 0.4 and 0.05\u00a0mm, respectively. Once displacement fields are calculated postprocessing evaluates, discards, and interpolates unreliable vectors. We use a peak ratio Q\u00a0<\u00a02 to validate uniqueness of vectors. More precisely, if a correlation peak value is less than twice the second peak value, the vector is discarded. Additionally, a universal outlier filter is applied to check for specious vectors within a 3 by 3 neighbourhood (Westerweel and Scarano, 2005). Discarded vectors in the displacement fields are replaced by an iterative interpolation requiring at least two neighbouring vectors. When summing up incremental displacement fields flow advection due to applied velocities are considered by using the Lagrangian sum of displacements (Boutelier et al., 2019).\nDisplacement fields are exported as DaVis inherent .vc7 files and further processed as .h5 files with MATLAB (version 18b). Using small strain approximation, the strain tensor E is obtained from displacements with:\n\n(8)\n\n\nE\nij\n\n=\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\ni\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\nj\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the components,\n\n(9)\n\nE\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nE\nxx\n\n\n\n\nE\nxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\nyx\n\n\n\n\nE\nyy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere Exx and Eyy are the normal strain components in x and y directions, respectively and Exy and Eyx are the shear components. Note, that for symmetrical tensors (i.e., non-rotational) Exy\u00a0=\u00a0Eyx. The maximum principal stretching axis (largest eigenvalue) defines the maximum normal strain, Esurf, on the surface and is expressed as:\n\n(10)\n\n\nE\nsurf\n\n=\n\n\n\nE\n\nx\nx\n\n\n+\n\nE\n\ny\ny\n\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\nxx\n\n\u2212\n\nE\nyy\n\n\n\n2\n\n4\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\nE\nxy\n\n+\n\nE\nyx\n\n\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEq. (10) is useful to express strain in our rotational experiments, as Esurf is independent of the coordinate system.\nTo enhance signal to noise ratio in incremental displacement fields, all incremental entities are further smoothened by averaging with the two previous and two subsequent incremental displacement fields (i.e., averaging over 5\u00a0min). For all displacement derived top view maps we use the Scientific colour maps package from Crameri (2018).\n\n\n3.6.2\nData post-processing\nFor an in-depth analysis, we further postprocess 3D stereo DIC data by applying the workflow shown in Fig. 5\n. The stereoscopic camera setup allows to obtain spatially high-resolution digital surface elevation models at any desired interval. For each conducted experiment, eleven topographic cross-sections perpendicular to the rift axis, track deformation in 10% intervals of the model length (i.e., 2%, 10%, 20%, \u2026, 90%, 98%; Fig. 5a). During the experiment runs, a data base is built up consisting of 2651 topographic profile lines (i.e., 11\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0241, including initial topography profiles). Due to the rigid basal setup our models are not isostatically compensated. Consequently, applied bulk extension homogeneously thins the viscous layer even so in the absence of localised deformation. Such homogenous thinning of the viscous layer results in an artificial regional subsidence which must be considered. We therefore use MATLAB (Ver. 2018 b) to correct topographic profiles by filtering out the effect of this regional subsidence. Fig. 5 shows the workflow of correcting topographic profiles. The along-strike profile P12-P12\u2032, indicated by the red dashed line (Fig. 5a,b), highlights the regional subsidence in the extensional domain that occurs away from the developing rift. To analyse vertical displacement features such as local rift shoulder uplift, we correct topographic profiles perpendicular to the long axis of the model (e.g., section P4-P4\u2032 in Fig. 5a). By treating each value of the surface height as a function of the spatial position within the profile line (i.e., H(x)\u00a0+\u00a0C) with C being a constant value indicating the regional subsidence (Fig. 5c), its numerical differential (dH\/dx) yields change in topography due to faulting (Fig. 5d). By applying the inverse function (i.e., the improper numerical integral), we back calculate the original shape of the function H(x) ignoring the regional subsidence C (Fig. 4e). Further, we track a strain value threshold of 10% along the boundary faults to quantify growth of single faults of the rift system (supplementary fig. S2). Note that we do not consider sedimentation nor erosion which would massively impede fault growth analysis and rift propagation examination otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nWe have conducted in total nine analogue models investigating the influence of variable maximum divergence velocities and brittle ductile ratios on rift propagation, fault growth and fault interaction in rotational rift settings. The first-order rift evolution, in terms of fault patterns, fault orientation as well as temporal and spatial relation, displays strong similarities in all our models. Therefore, we present the results in this section based on our reference model Mod_1_10 and consider them to be representative for the general evolution of deformation in our models. Inarguably, alterations of second-order features occur when changing initial conditions and must be discussed. Hence, we compare all models with our reference model in the discussion and take them into account for our conclusion.\n\n4.1\nQualitative rift evolution\nAfter ca. 5\u00a0mm of maximum extension (at the distal part in the extensional domain), initial deformation structures of the nascent rift become visible at the surface (Fig. 6a,e). A CT cross section image from model Mod_1_10_CT (Fig. 6i) indicated by the red line (Fig. 6e) shows a first set of conjugate faults which corresponds to the boundary fault segments in model Mod_1_10 (Fig. 6e) at this stage. These extensional faults strike orthogonal with respect to the extension direction and show a steep dip angle of about 70\u00b0. At the brittle\/viscous boundary these fault planes unite at the tip of the viscous seed. Faults in surface view develop either as distinctive short, segmented faults (Fig. 6e) or as long continuous faults, propagating towards the rotation axis over time. The conjugate extensional faults establish an early graben structure and further extension is localised on these two rift faults; hereafter called rift boundary faults. After 15\u00a0mm extension, early isolated fault segments are entirely connected building a continuous rift basin with widths of about 3 to 4\u00a0cm (Fig. 6b,f,j). After 20\u00a0mm extension, further deformation has accumulated along the boundary faults while additionally a new fault forms in the centre of the rift basin (Fig. 6c,g,k). Conjugate boundary faults gently rotate from an original dip angle of 70\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 and a set of newly formed conjugate faults (hereafter called intra rift faults) becomes visible in the CT scan images (Fig. 6k). Note that the black arrows in CT cross sections indicate zones of upward flow of the viscous mixture (see discussion Section 5.1). Contemporaneously, in the contractional domain initial surface deformation indicates thrust faulting (Fig. 6c,g). At around 26.6\u00a0mm extension, the pair of conjugate normal faults, formerly only visible in CT scan images, fully develops in the hanging wall of the rift boundary faults forming a central intra-rift graben localising further extensional deformation (Fig. 6d,h,l). Fig. 7\n shows the final stage after 40\u00a0mm extension, where the rift propagated towards the rotation axis. At this stage the rift boundary faults are completely linked and delimit a first-generation graben structure. In the central part of the rift zone, second-generation conjugate intra-rift normal faults form an intra-rift graben, which expresses further localised subsidence. At the latest stage, weakly visible third-generation extensional faults initiate and indicate the potential formation of a future minor intra-rift basin (Fig. 7a,b). The migration of active faulting in the rift centre that can be inferred from the gradual increase of subsidence towards the rift axis is clearly visible in our model. In the contractional domain, at a maximum contraction after 240\u00a0min, two conjugate thrusts appear forming a pop-up structure.\n\n\n4.2\nQuantitative rift evolution\nIn addition to the qualitative description of top view images, maps of various displacement components derived from 3D stereo DIC enable the quantitative analysis and visualisation of displacement distribution, subsidence, and localised strain patterns. We use incremental as well as cumulative (i.e., dt\u00a0=\u00a060 s for the reference model Mod_1_10) vertical displacement components, dz. and Dz, respectively to show the temporal and total subsidence. Incremental strain-rates obtained from incremental displacement field data are used to derive incremental maximum normal strain-rate values (i.e., the maximum principal stretching rate) to reveal fault activity. Identical time intervals as shown for the qualitative analysis (Figs. 6 and 7) are used for the quantitative model description.\n\n4.2.1\nCumulative vertical displacement (Dz)\n\nFig. 8\n shows the cumulative vertical displacement field for the same extension values as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Note that values are not corrected for regional subsidence, resulting in a wider area of diffuse subsidence and uplift in the extensional and contractional domains, respectively. After 5\u00a0mm of maximum extension (Fig. 8a), the two conjugate boundary faults separate undeformed domains of minor subsidence and a distinct graben with maximum total subsidence (Dz) of ca. 4\u00a0mm. After 15\u00a0mm extension (Fig. 8b), total subsidence within the rift has increased to ca. 8\u00a0mm. Both rift boundary faults propagated towards the rotation axis and total subsidence within the rift decrease towards the rotation axis. Across from the rotation axis, a diffuse zone of uplift defines the early stages of contraction. At 20\u00a0mm maximum extension (Fig. 8c), localised subsidence within the rift zone gradually increases. Intra rift faults become visible at 400\u00a0mm with respect to the rotation axis. In the contractional domain, uplift is limited to a narrower area with a step in the uplift values marking the surface expression of thrust faults. Between 20\u00a0mm and 30\u00a0mm of maximum extension (Fig. 8c,d,e), intra rift faults further propagate towards the rotation axis. In the contractional domain, thrusting results in uplift up to 5\u00a0mm in the central part (i.e., between \u221250 and 50\u00a0mm model width). At the final state (Fig. 8f), both boundary faults have reached the rotational axis. It is noteworthy, that the evolution of distinct deformation features takes place in the earlier stages of the model with successive displacement accumulation in later stages.\n\n\n4.2.2\nIncremental vertical displacement (dz)\nIncremental vertical displacement dz. describes the active subsidence and uplift movements in a specific time interval, and therefore, allows the distinction of major and minor phases of uplift and subsidence. Fig. 9\n shows the temporal sequence of incremental vertical displacement. Note that sharp colour contrasts in the subsidence indicate active faults. After 5\u00a0mm extension (Fig. 9a), active subsidence is distributed over the entire rift zone with subsidence rates up to 0.1\u00a0mm per minute at distal model parts indicating homogeneous and uniform subsidence of the rift graben structure at rift transects (i.e., both rift boundary faults take up similar amounts of vertical displacement). The subsidence rate changes linearly from maximum vertical displacement rates of 0.1\u00a0mm per minute from the distal extension domain to zero close to the rotation axis. After 5\u00a0mm extension, both rift boundary faults have taken up similar amounts of total vertical displacement of about 2\u00a0mm (see Fig. 8a). In this early rift stage, uplift in the contractional domain occurs in a broad and diffuse fashion, although increased values of uplift in the centre are visible. Propagation of the rift boundary faults becomes evident after 15\u00a0mm extension (Fig. 9b). The well-defined incremental subsidence pattern propagates towards the rotation axis forming a continuous graben structure in between the rift boundary faults. After 20\u00a0mm extension (Fig. 9c), however, the rift-wide uniform subsidence pattern changes towards more localised subsidence in the rift centre in the distal rift zone (about 400 to 500\u00a0mm with respect to the rotation axis). The localisation of subsidence along this section indicates the transfer of fault displacement from the major boundary faults towards intra rift faults in the rift centre. After 26.6\u00a0mm extension (Fig. 9d), fault activity along both boundary faults decreased at the distal extension domain and further vertical displacement is taken up by a pair of conjugate intra rift faults. However, both boundary faults are still active closer to the rotation axis. Considering the divergence velocity gradient, boundary faults at the distal end reflect a more mature rift stage and experience inward fault migration first. In the final stage (Fig. 9e), incremental vertical displacement shows that the pair of conjugate boundary faults is still active near the rotation axis and at a distant zone (300\u2013500\u00a0mm), a pair of conjugate intra rift faults are active. Vertical displacement in the distal rift zone is narrowed down and indistinguishable. The fault segment activity for the final model stage is illustrated in Fig. 9f.\n\n\n4.2.3\nIncremental maximum normal strain rate on surface (esurf)\nThe temporal sequence of fault activity is analysed using incremental strain rate maps obtained from the maximum surface strain Esurf. In the first 5\u00a0mm of extension, the first generation of fault segments (rift boundary faults) are observed in the strain-rate maps as well-localised continuous linear features (Fig. 10a). After 15\u00a0mm extension, the boundary faults remain active, but a second-generation conjugate set of intra rift faults is indicated by new fault trends with moderate strain-rate values in between the rift boundary faults (Fig. 10b). After 20\u00a0mm extension, second-generation fault segments (intra rift faults) develop in between the two existing conjugate normal faults in the distal extension domain shown by increasing strain-rates along these fault trends (Fig. 10c). Strain-rate values of the rift boundary faults drop (and therefore activity) as intra rift faults develop in between indicating progressive migration of fault activity on intra rift structures. The second-generation intra rift faults propagate as conjugate normal faults towards the rotation axis similar to the first-generation rift boundary faults. As intra rift faults grow and accumulate strain, strain-rate values along the rift boundary faults locally decrease (Fig. 10d) indicating fault abandonment. At the final stage, in the distal rift zone activity along third-generation faults is shown by localised strain-rate values in the rift centre (Fig. 10e). It is notable that at this stage, activity along 3rd generation faults is documented in the incremental strain rate data (Fig. 10e) but not yet in the incremental vertical displacement map, yet (Fig. 9e,f).\n\n\n\n4.3\nStrain rate distribution for models with varying maximum divergence velocities and brittle ductile-ratios RBD\n\n\nFig. 11\n shows strain rate maps (i.e., incremental maximum normal strain rate on surface) for identical maximum extension values used to present the fault evolution of the reference model. For models with a brittle-ductile ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a01 (Mod_1_10, Mod_1_20 and Mod_1_40), activation of successive fault generations (i.e., intra-rift faults) is subsequently stalled with increasing divergence velocities (Fig. 11a). Therefore, activity of 3rd generation faults is limited to model Mod_1_10 with a maximum divergence velocity of 10\u00a0mm\/h. This also holds for models with a brittle-ductile ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a03 (Mod_3_10, Mod_3_20 and Mod_3_40; Fig. 11b), where faulting mainly occurs along 1st generation rift boundary faults. The activation of 2nd generation faults is for all conducted divergence velocities limited to late stages of the model runs and 3rd generation faults are entirely absent. Moreover, models with different brittle-ductile ratios differ in average rift width (i.e., the distance between conjugate rift boundary faults at the model surface). For a brittle-ductile ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a01, the average rift width is about 30\u00a0mm, whereas for models with a ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a03, the average rift width is about 50\u00a0mm. The increase in rift width is a geometric effect of the thicker brittle layer in models with ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a03. In addition, higher velocities models (Mod_1_20, Mod_1_40, Mod_3_20 and Mod_3_40) show increased boundary effects towards the end of the model runs, indicated by oblique zones of increased strain rate values near the curved model boundary in the extension domain.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nThe gradient in rift maturity towards the rotation axis reflects the imposed velocity gradient and is an essential and common aspect in models investigating rotational rifting (see Khalil et al., 2020; Maestrelli et al., 2020; Molnar et al., 2017; Molnar et al., 2020; Molnar et al., 2018, 2019; Zwaan and Schreurs, 2020; Zwaan et al., 2020). Indeed, our models confirm first-order observations and show similarities when compared with previous analogue modelling studies of rotational rifting. Our reference model Mod_1_10 is in strong agreement with the rotational model series presented in Zwaan et al. (2020). This is expected since we use a similar setup here. Similarly, we use a central weak \u201cseed\u201d on top of the viscous layer to localise faulting along a central rift system facilitating the detailed study of fault growth and rift propagation. Maestrelli et al. (2020) use for their crustal scale models a brittle-ductile ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a01 and maximum divergence velocities of 20\u00a0mm\/h, like our model Mod_1_20. However, their model setup has two fundamental differences. In contrast to localised deformation in our models, Maestrelli et al. (2020) use a rubber sheet at the base of the viscous layer producing distributed deformation expressed by fault swarms. In addition, Maestrelli et al. (2020) examine the influence of inherited fabrics in the brittle model part crosscut by a propagating rift (see also Zwaan and Schreurs (2020)). Analogue modelling studies by Molnar et al. (2017); Molnar et al. (2020); Molnar et al. (2018, 2019) and Khalil et al. (2020) perform rotational rifting experiments at lithospheric scale and examine the influence of inherited crustal and mantle heterogeneities. Despite propagating rifts towards the rotation axis, their models show occasionally lateral, shifts in rift localisation, perpendicular to the rift propagation direction. This may be attributed to the asymmetric opening of their setup. However, mantle and crustal heterogeneities primarily deflect rift structures and influence the rift pattern. Despite different scales and setups, first-order similarities such as a \u201cv-shaped\u201d extensional domain and a gradient in rift maturity decreasing towards the rotation axis, are common in these studies and our first-order observations fit well with the aforementioned studies.\nIn the following, we discuss similarities and differences between reference model and models with varying maximum extension velocities and crustal configuration and put our findings into the context of recent modelling studies addressing rotational rifting. Moreover, we discuss basin evolution and provide a characterisation of rift propagation in the light of fault localisation, fault segmentation and fault growth based on high-resolution 3D Stereo Digital Image Correlation.\n\n5.1\nThe role of the viscous layer and its influence on inward migration of fault activity\nProgressive inward migration of active faulting from initial large boundary faults to intra-rift faults leads to progressive narrowing of the tectonically active rift. This has not only been shown in quantitative modelling studies of orthogonal and oblique rifting (e.g., Agostini et al., 2009; Corti, 2012; Corti et al., 2013; Corti et al., 2010) but is also observed in modelling studies investigating rotational systems (e.g., Molnar et al., 2017; Mondy et al., 2018; Zwaan et al., 2020).\nFor homogeneous models (i.e., no pre-existing weakness, inherited fabric, or weak seed), the average fault slip velocity and the number of faults in the brittle layer is governed by the stretching and simultaneous thinning of the underlying viscous layer due to the applied extension. The rate of thinning of the viscous layer decreases over time providing less vertical displacement and related accommodation space. Subsequently, fault slip along the marginal rift faults in the brittle layer decreases over time forcing the system to increase the number of faults by inward migration to accommodate bulk extension (Corti et al., 2010; Schueller et al., 2005). In Eq. (11), dh\/dt is the thinning rate of a homogeneous viscous layer, A is the constant area (assuming mass conservation) of a 2D section with initial width w0 and applied extension velocity v over a time t.\n\n(11)\n\n\ndh\ndt\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\nA\n\nv\n\n\n\n\nv\n\nt\n+\n\nw\n0\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, for higher divergence velocities, slip along rift boundary faults decreases faster as the viscous layer below thins faster, leading to an early inward migration of faulting activity in the brittle layer.\nWith respect to our models this would imply faster onset of rift narrowing and inward migration for a higher maximum divergence velocity. However, for models with higher divergence velocities, inward migration is progressively delayed (Fig. 11). This observation seems counterintuitive and is best seen in models with a brittle-ductile ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a01 (Fig. 11a). In contrast, for models with a higher brittle-ductile ratio RBD\u00a0=\u00a03, deformation is taken up mostly by the rift boundary faults, regardless of the maximum divergence velocity. This relation between brittle crust thickness and intra-rift faulting fits well with conclusions from previous studies (e.g., Corti et al., 2010).\nCT imagery cross sections may give an answer for the observed delayed inward migration for higher maximum divergence velocities (Figs. 6i-l, 7c,d, Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). Intra-rift faults first form as antithetic normal faults (with respect to the rift boundary faults) and subside due to displacement accumulating along the rift boundary faults (Fig. 6j, Supplementary Fig. S3). This phase coincides with the low strain rate values along the intra-rift faults (Fig. 10b). It is only after the rift boundary faults laterally move apart that intra-rift faults reach the brittle-ductile interface. At this point, fault activity increases along intra-rift faults and drops along rift boundary faults (Figs. 6k and 10c). Corti et al. (2010) propose a localised zone of high shear stress at the brittle-ductile interface, where brittle strength is low and faulting initiates (i.e., above the seed location). In that sense, intra-rift faults in our models become active (i.e., rift inward migration) when they reach the zone of high shear stress at the brittle-ductile interface and fault activity along rift boundary faults ceases.\nWe assume that this process is related to localised upward flow of the viscous material in the seed region (see e.g., Zwaan et al., 2017; Figs. 6k,l 7c) which shifts the brittle-ductile interface upwards. With progressive upward shift, the formerly scarcely (if any) active intra-rift faults are in proximity of the high shear stress zone and start to accommodate displacement. With higher divergence velocities (e.g., Mod_1_20, Mod_1_40), upward flow in the viscous layer along the weak seed may not proportionally increase. Consequently, intra-rift faults remain for a longer period outside of the high shear stress zone allowing the rift boundary faults to accommodate further displacement. Note that the suggested mechanism may provide an explanation for the delay in inward migration, however, further work investigating the cause of this phenomenon is needed.\n\n\n5.2\nRift morphology and basin symmetry\nWe document the control of active tectonics on basin subsidence and rift geometry by combining incremental vertical displacement maps with topographic surface profiles. Incremental displacements may focus active deformation on either a set of conjugate faults at the time or on faults belonging to two different fault generations. Hence, we define phases of symmetric and asymmetric distribution of active deformation (as seen in cross-sections perpendicular to the rift axis), respectively. The morphological evolution is similar in all nine conducted experiments and incremental vertical displacement patterns strongly coincide with incremental strain rate maps (Fig. 12\n). We therefore return to our reference model Mod_1_10 to investigate rift morphology. Analogous to the rift inward migration, we discuss displacement distribution and its influence on rift morphology and subsidence as a function of i) the distance to the rotation axis and ii) time.\n\ni)\n\nDistance to the rotation axis\n\n\n\n\nAs illustrated in our models, inward migration of fault activity occurs in segments with rift boundary faults forming first, followed by subsequent generations of intra rift faults with increasing bulk extension in the respective rift segment (Figs. 10, 11 and 12). In rift transects at different distances from the rotation axis, inward fault migration occurs asynchronously along both intra rift conjugate faults (Fig. 12). Therefore, faults belonging to two different fault generations are locally active at the same time. For example, in section P2 in Fig. 12a, one side of the rift boundary fault is still active (BF 1st in section P2, Fig. 12a), while fault activity on the opposite rift flank has migrated inwards (IF 2nd in section P2, Fig. 12a). This results in asymmetric distribution of deformation due to the phased switching and strain partitioning between boundary and intra rift faults (see profile P2, Fig. 12a). We call such a transient rift stage hereafter the asymmetric rifting stage.\nWhile in the distal rift segment (profile P2, Fig. 12a) two active fault generations cause asymmetric deformation distribution, at the same time and closer to the rotation axis deformation distribution is symmetric resulting in a symmetric rift morphology at this stage. In this proximal domain of the rift (profile lines P5 and P6, Fig. 12a), fault activity is located at the conjugate rift boundary faults resulting in symmetric subsidence. Similarly, to the asymmetric rift stage, we call this stage hereafter the symmetric rifting stage.\n\nii)\n\nTime\n\n\n\n\nWith progressive rift extension (e.g., time; compare Fig. 12a and b, and Fig. 12b and c), previously symmetric rift domains (i.e., profile line P5, Fig. 12a) become asymmetric and vice versa (i.e., profile line P2, Fig. 12a). At profile line P2 in Fig. 12b, faulting is mainly focused on the intra rift faults which controls a localised symmetric deformation distribution. Bends in the topographic profile in P2 in Fig. 12b on both sides of the rift reflect the completed inward migration and therefore, the transition from asymmetric to symmetric rifting stage. In contrast, at profile line P5 in Fig. 12b, deformation distribution is asymmetric. The local activation of different fault generations is a function of bulk extension on this respective transect. For profile lines P2, P5 and P6 bulk extension values increase between 120 and 240\u00a0min by 4.5%, 2.5% and 2%, respectively. All three transects consistently experience switches between symmetric and asymmetric phases of deformation distribution for distinct bulk extension values.\nIn summary, for each fault generation localisation and displacement transfer between faults is expressed by symmetric and asymmetric rift stages. During the model runs, different rift segments along the rift axis experience inward migration of fault activity at different time steps (different extension values). This complies with the deformation distribution. In segments of ongoing inward rift migration, deformation distribution is asymmetric. In contrast, rift segments show symmetric deformation distribution, where conjugate faults of the same generation are active.\n\n\n5.3\nStyles of fault growth controlling rift propagation\nAs a measure of displacement along faults, vertical displacement is referred to as throw and is commonly measured in field studies, where true displacement is poorly preserved (e.g., Cartwright et al., 1995; Jackson et al., 2017; Jackson and Rotevatn, 2013; Walsh et al., 2003). Plotting displacement against along-strike fault distance yields typical displacement\/length relationships. Moreover, studies using analogue experiments have investigated fault growth (e.g., Bellahsen et al., 2003a; Schlagenhauf et al., 2008) giving insights into fault segmentation and linkage processes. For practical reasons, we use cumulative maximum normal strain (instead of displacement; Eq. (10)) as a proxy for fault activity and demonstrate, based on our reference model Mod_1_10, the necessity of high temporal resolution image series to unravel early stages of rift propagation in rotational settings.\n\n5.3.1\nA switch in fault growth mechanism\nStrain maps of cumulative maximum normal strain show two distinct growth phases of the rift boundary faults with a first phase of rapid bidirectional lengthening followed by slow and unidirectional propagation towards the rotation axis. We demonstrate the rapid switch in fault growth mechanism based on early stages at around 1.5% of bulk extension for model Mod_1_10 (Fig. 13\n). There, well-developed continuous, as well as isolated segments of conjugate boundary faults show high total strain separated by zones of lower total strain (Fig. 13a). Boundary fault F1 is a continuous fault whereas the conjugate boundary fault F2 still consists of isolated segments. The single discrete fault segments of F2 merge within two minutes into a continuous boundary fault segment (Fig. 13c,e). When plotting cumulative strain along the fault length, fault segment linkage is indicated by strain minima along the profile and is also visible for linkage events prior to this event (e.g., for F2 at a distance 450\u00a0mm to the rotation axis; Fig. 13b,d,e). Note that the linkage of individual segments occurs by bidirectional growth. That is, faults also grow oppositely with respect to the rift propagation direction.\nIn all our models, early rift propagation is dominated by bi-directional growth of fault segments towards and away from the rotation pole shortly before switching fault growth mechanism (see also Fig. 15 and Section 5.3.3). Subsequent growth of linked faults occurs unidirectionally towards the rotation axis. While boundary fault F2 still grows step-wise by segment linkage (indicated by strain minima in between segments; Fig. 13b,d,f), F1 advances to a linear growth mechanism indicated by linearly decreasing strain values towards the rotation axis (Fig. 13 b,d,f). After less than 25% of total bulk extension, all isolated fault segments have been linked to two distinct, continuous, and conjugate rift boundary faults and fault growth has switched to linear, unidirectional growth towards the rotation axis.\n\n\n5.3.2\nStrain partitioning between competing conjugate faults\nThe switch in fault growth mechanism has a distinct effect on the overall rift propagation (Fig. 14\n). Stepwise fault growth due to segment linkage occurs in early stages resulting in high fault tip propagation rates (Fig. 14b). Eventually, when both boundary faults reach the unidirectional, linear growth stage propagation rates drastically drop (Fig. 14b). Fig. 14c shows the position of the conjugate boundary fault tips over time. Steep slope segments within the first hour, indicate fast growth by linkage of fault segments (incline in Fig. 14c, d). Rapid rift propagation is followed by a long period, in which boundary fault tips propagate less effectively (plateau in Fig. 14c,d). During the rapid growth phase, the curves of both boundary faults show steeper segments alternating with plateaus indicating periods of minor fault growth. This characteristic pattern of fault tip advance is well demonstrated in the 30 to 40\u00a0min interval (Fig. 14c inset). During this time interval, the fault tip position of rift boundary fault F1 has experienced intermittent phases of fast growth (steep slope) and less prominent growth (less steep slope). The onset of flattening coincides with the onset of a linear growth stage of boundary fault F2. The contrasting growth rates of the two conjugate boundary faults reflect strain partitioning. When growth of one boundary fault is favoured, growth of the other is temporarily suppressed and vice versa. The bulk extension across the rift zone is mostly accommodated by one fault at the time. This explains the two different, simultaneously active growth mechanisms in Figs. 13 and 14. Growth rates of boundary fault F1 are highest during early fault localisation with a maximum growth rate of 4.8\u00a0m per hour at times when growth of F2 is inactive (Fig. 14d). Only shortly after activity of boundary fault F1 decreased, growth rates for F2 rise to peak rates of about 3\u00a0m per hour (Fig. 14d). In contrast to F1, peak growth rates for F2 are smaller. However, rapid changes in fault growth rates of F1 allow F2 to maintain growth rates above average for a longer period to keep up with the rift tip position of F1. Only after one boundary fault has reached linear growth stage, ongoing bulk extension is localised on the other boundary fault to complete the linkage stage and reach linear growth. In contrast to inward migration of fault activity, strain partitioning between competing conjugate faults occurs at much smaller time scales and no evident influence on the rift morphology (i.e., a change from symmetric to asymmetric displacement distribution) is observed in surface view.\n\n\n5.3.3\nConceptual fault growth model\nWe have shown that rift growth by segment linkage represents an effective way of accommodating high extensional strain in the distal rift zone far away from the rotation axis. Consequently, it yields high mean rift propagation rates which then drastically decrease and stabilize as the growth mechanism changes to linear unidirectional growth. The switch in fault growth mechanism holds for all nine analysed experiments (Fig. 15\n). Notably, all models show a distinct change of growth mechanism at around 25% of the total bulk extension, which also reflects a change in the rift propagation rate (Fig. 15a). Based on the two distinctive growth phases, 75% of the total rift length in our models establish within the first 25% of the model run time (see orange arrows and green arrows in Fig. 15a). The early lengthening of boundary faults is also reflected in the relationship between fault length and accumulated strain (as a proxy for displacement; Fig. 15b). The fault behaviour through time is characterised by a phase of dominant fault lengthening and little strain accumulation (orange arrows), prior to a second phase of dominant strain accumulation and minor lengthening (purple arrows). During the first phase 75% of the total fault length is established and strain accumulation mainly occurs in concert with the last 25% of fault lengthening. The first phase of fault lengthening in Fig. 15b reflects the first phase of rapid rift propagation in Fig. 15a. Consequently, the phase of major strain accumulation (purple arrows Fig. 15b) reveals that the second phase of rift propagation is in concert with a dominant phase of strain accumulation. In accordance with Figs. 13 and 14, Fig. 15c, shows that distal segments relative to the rotation axis accumulate strain along linking fault segments enabling the rift to propagate rapidly over 75% of the total length within 25% of the applied bulk extension (orange arrows Fig. 15a-c). Proximal segments relative to the rotation axis experience less bulk extension and grow linearly, expressed by slow rift propagation over the remaining 25% of length within the remaining 75% of bulk extension (green arrows Fig. 15a,c). Simultaneously to linear rift propagation near the rotation axis, distal segments accumulate further strain (purple arrows Fig. 15b,c).\nTo further discuss fault growth of boundary faults in our models, we consider two common conceptual fault growth models. In the \u201cpropagating fault model\u201d, fault displacement and length increase synchronously by fault linkage (as expressed by displacement minima along strike of normal faults) and fault tip propagation (see Rotevatn et al., 2019 and references therein; Walsh and Watterson, 1988; Watterson, 1986). In contrast, the \u201cconstant length model\u201d states that faults establish their length almost instantaneously followed by continuous increase of displacement (Nicol et al., 2005; Walsh et al., 2002). Although these two conceptual models were designed to explain fault growth under orthogonal extension, we compare them with fault growth in our rotational extension models. We document an early phase of rapid fault growth by fault segment linkage (see Figs. 13, 14 and 15). This is expressed by the occurrence of displacement minima along strike, an observation typically attributed to the propagating fault model. As a result, the rift tip rapidly propagates towards the rotation axis and establishes a greater part of the final rift length at an early stage. Fault segment linkage together with almost instantaneous lengthening seems to be a conflicting observation favouring neither of the two conceptual models. In addition, all our models include linear weak \u201cseeds\u201d to localise deformation. The local weakening of the brittle strength is similar to a pre-existing crustal fabric and would favour the constant length model (e.g., Morley, 1999; Nicol et al., 2005). Nevertheless, we document rapid lengthening (constant length model) which, itself relies on fault segment linkage (fault propagation model). To solve this discrepancy, Jackson et al. (2017) proposed that propagating and constant length model mutually, rather than exclusively, contribute to the fault development with a very early phase of growth of small segments that increase in length and displacement before they link to form a larger structure. This very early stage may have remained unresolved in nature due to relative low temporal resolution. Indeed, Rotevatn et al. (2019) describe data which behaves broadly according to the constant length model and report an initial stage with phases of significant displacement accumulation rather than lengthening (Fig. 16c). We also document such early stages of strain accumulation within data that overall behaves according to the constant length model. Short impulses of growth may not just only reflect strain partitioning between conjugate boundary faults (Fig. 14c inset) but may also be indicative for early stages of strain accumulation within the overall phase of fault lengthening.\nThe two distinct fault growth mechanisms documented in our models thus mutually contribute to fault growth (and ultimately rift propagation) and represent transient stages of a complex evolution. This refers to the concept of a hybrid growth model (Rotevatn et al., 2019), in which rapid fault lengthening itself is enabled by fault segment linkage followed by a second phase dominated by strain accumulation. Note that in our models, unidirectional growth during the second phase is dictated by the gradient of the applied bulk extension along the rift axis. This is in strong contrast to orthogonal extension where lateral fault propagation is generally inferred to occur bidirectionally (Jackson et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n5.4\nImplications for nature and potential predictions\nThe Taupo Rift Zone (Fig. 1) is characterised by a gradient in rift maturity along the rift axis and changes in deformation style along the rift axis (Villamor and Berryman, 2006). Its southward propagation and the changes in extension rates along the rift axis have been a matter of debate (Beanland and Haines, 1998; Villamor and Berryman, 2006; Wallace et al., 2004) but GPS data and field evidence are in favour of a rotational opening of the Taupo rift due to a clockwise rotation of the North Island of New Zealand (Nicol and Wallace, 2007; Wallace et al., 2005). Models suggest that tectonic block rotation arises from the change of subduction of the Pacific plate along the Hikurangi Trough, to a collision of the Hikurangi Plateau and Chatham Rise further to the south (Wallace et al., 2004). Extension rates along the rift axis range from about 17\u00a0mm\/a to 2\u00a0mm\/a in the northern and southern segments, respectively and block rotation rates are in the order of 3\u00b0 - 3.5\u00b0\/Ma over the last 1.5\u00a0Ma (Nicol and Wallace, 2007). These values fit well for our high-divergence velocity models and are still comparable to our low divergence velocity models. Although nature depicts a more complex rift evolution, we consider the Taupo rift to be an excellence natural example of rotational rifting to discuss the implication of our models for nature.\n\nVillamor and Berryman (2006) conclude, based on gravitational anomalies, that extension rates along the Taupo Rift change abruptly along distinct accommodation zones (parallel sided) rather than gradually (wedge shaped; Beanland and Haines, 1998). These sharp gradients are also expressed in the shape of different rift segments active at different times (i.e., old, young, and modern Taupo Rift; Fig. 1). Stepwise migration of fault activity towards the rift axis indeed is enticing and favourable for the parallel sided extension model (Villamor and Berryman, 2006; Villamor et al., 2017). However, our models show that even in the presence of a constant divergence velocity gradient, inward migration of fault activity does occur stepwise and no abrupt changes in extension rates are needed (Fig. 10). In that light, the gradual decrease in the extension rates towards the southern end of the Taupo Rift (Nicol and Wallace, 2007) does not contradict the stepwise migration but can all the more explain the overall shape of the Taupo rift. The active modern Taupo rift (0\u201325\u00a0ka) consists of a 40\u00a0km and 15\u00a0km wide zone in the Southern and Northern part of the Taupo rift, respectively (e.g., Villamor et al., 2017). Although nature depicts a more complex evolution including magmatic processes, incremental strain rate analysis of our analogue models show patterns where multiple generations of faults are active at the same time along the rift axis (Figs. 10 and 11). The wider area of fault activity close to the rotation axis in our models (Fig. 10e) is comparable with the southern Taupo Rift and provides a potential explanation for step wise widening of the active fault zone towards the present-day termination of the Taupo rift (also compare Fig. 8 in (Villamor et al., 2017) and Fig. 10 in this study).\nFault growth in our models depicts a detailed evolution of rift boundary fault growth and partitioning of displacement between competing conjugate faults (Section 5.3; Figs. 14 and 17\n). We show that a switch in growth mechanism from segment linkage-dominated to unilateral propagation occurs only after a short time (20\u201325%) of the model run. In the context of the Taupo Rift, this means significant increases of fault maturity within a range of 300\u00a0ka (Nicol et al., 2010). However, assessing early stages of fault growth poses a fundamentally difficult task since displacement-length ratios recorded from recent and ancient rifts only represent static snap shots of a kinematically more complex fault growth evolution. Techniques such as back stripping (e.g., Jackson et al., 2017) may improve the understanding of normal fault growth in nature. However, in the case of basin underfilling, analysis of growth strata becomes problematic (Rotevatn et al., 2019). Therefore, in nature time constraints on fault activity are often rather poor and hence, such early stages of bidirectional lengthening and strain accruement as seen in our models are difficult to resolve, which highlights the importance of modelling studies on fault growth at high temporal resolution.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nWe performed a series of brittle-viscous analogue model experiments to gain insights into natural rifts that have formed under the influence of along strike extension gradients. Analysis of our models involved visualisation by X-ray computed tomography and quantification of surface deformation. The application of temporal high-resolution 3D stereo DIC allows a detailed quantitative analysis of fault growth revealing fault linkage and fault propagation mechanisms that have not been recognized before. Our results are summarized below and have important implications for conceptual models of fault growth.\n\n\u2022\nInitial bulk extension during the first phase is accommodated by a set of conjugate normal faults above the viscous seed. These rift boundary faults initially dip at 70\u00b0 and limit the rift basin.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe fault growth evolution of the rift boundary faults is characterised by a first rapid phase of fault lengthening accompanied by minor displacement, followed by a second phase of pronounced displacement and minor fault lengthening towards the rotation axis.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe first phase is characterised by bidirectional fault growth through the linkage of discrete fault segments which is an efficient mechanism for fault lengthening. This bidirectional fault growth can only be detected by applying high-temporal resolution DIC analysis.\n\n\n\u2022\nFault tip propagation and fault displacement occurs alternatingly on one of the two rift boundary faults indicating strain partitioning between the conjugate faults: when one of the normal faults propagates laterally and accumulates displacement, the oppositely dipping normal fault shows little or no propagation and displacement, and vice versa.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn contrast to the first phase of rapid fault lengthening by bidirectional fault growth, the second phase of minor fault lengthening occurs unidirectional towards the rotation axis.\n\n\n\u2022\nIntra-rift faults first form as anithetic normal faults and subside due to displacement accumulating along the rift boundary faults. With progressive applied bulk extension and rift widening, intra-rift faults reach the brittle-ductile interface and further strain accumulation is accommodated along intra-rift faults. The onset of such inward migration is segment-wise and asynchronous along the rift axis, initiating furthest away from the rotation axis and propagating towards it. This can result in segmented widening of fault activity towards the rift termination which is also observed in natural rift systems such as the Taupo Rift Zone.\n\n\n\u2022\nFor models with higher maximum divergence velocities, inward migration of fault activity is delayed due to strengthening of the viscous layer (higher strain rates) which reduces viscous upward flow near the seed resulting in slower rotation of rift boundary faults and thus delaying formation of intra-rift faults.\n\n\n\u2022\nFault growth evolution in our models is best described by a hybrid fault growth model. Although initially proposed for orthogonal divergence, this fault growth model, seems also to be valid for natural rifts where divergence velocities change along strike.\n\n\n\u2022\nMajor fault lengthening in our models occurs rapidly. When scaled to nature, this implies that fault segment interactions leading to fault lengthening may be difficult to detect in natural rifts as time constraints on fault activity are often rather scarce. This emphasizes all the more the necessity of modelling studies to understand fault growth and, ultimately, rift propagation.\n\n\n\n\n\nData availability\nRheological measurements of the brittle materials used in this study are available in the form of two open access data publications via GFZ Data Services (Schmid et al., 2020a,b, respectively).

It is closely related to crustal kinematics and the associated rock deformation by folding and fracturing, eventually leading even to earthquake formation. Therefore, studying the characteristics of the contemporary crustal stress state is fundamental not only for the understanding of the deformation mechanism in the crust and the underlying dynamic processes, but also because stresses play a key role in the seismic hazard assessment of active faults (Heidbach et al., 2010).\nThe eastern Tibetan Plateau (Fig. 1\n) is located in a special tectonic setting, where the crust is characterized by distinctive geomorphic features and numerous complex regional faults, making it one of the most attractive sites in the world for geodynamic studies (Clark and Royden, 2000; Royden, 1997; Tapponnier et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2007). Especially after the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake, which occurred on the Longmen Shan fault zone (F3-6) at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau and killed more than 80,000 people, crustal stress state related studies have been a primary focus of work in the area. Among others, this has led to a re-examination of the uplift pattern of the eastern Tibetan Plateau (Burchfiel et al., 2008; Hubbard and Shaw, 2009), as well as to an assessment of the deformation characteristics (Xu et al., 2009) and the seismic hazard of the faults near the epicenter of the Wenchuan earthquake (Wan and Shen, 2010). At the same time, the construction of important infrastructure projects in the area, such as hydropower stations and the Chengdu-Lhasa high-speed railway, demanded for accurate stress data, which also emphasizes the value of a quantitative study of the crustal stress state in the eastern Tibetan Plateau from the practical point of view.\nIn recent years, a number of observational studies of the crustal stress field have been carried out at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau to investigate the mechanics of the Wenchuan earthquake and its potential impact on the seismic hazard of the faults nearby. For example, using the hydrofrac technique, researchers determined the magnitudes and orientations of the principal stresses along the Longmen Shan fault zone (Meng et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2009, 2016b). They found that the maximum horizontal stress orientation is mainly NW-SE in the southwestern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone (F3-6) and changes to scattered in the northeastern segment (NE-SW, ENE-WSW, E-W) (see Fig. 1). However, for technical and cost reasons, the maximum depths of these measurements are usually limited to a few hundred meters (Fig. 2\n), i.e., much shallower than the focal depths in this area (5\u201320\u00a0km; Fang et al., 2015, 2018; Li et al., 2019). In addition, the hydrofrac measurements are also sparsely distributed (Fig. 1). In order to obtain information on the stress state in the deep crust, focal mechanism solutions of earthquakes, such as the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0, 2013 Lushan Ms7.0, 2014 Kangding Ms6.3 and 2017 Jiuzhaigou Ms7.0 earthquake sequences have been used (Li et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2019) (see Fig. 1). From these data, the stress orientations and the tectonic regime, but no stress magnitudes have been inferred. These stress observations clearly reveal that the crustal stress field at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is heterogeneous with spatially variable stress orientations and magnitudes. This holds especially for local areas with complex fault structures, such as the northeastern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone, where the stress orientation is rather scattered (Fig. 1).\nIn studies of dynamic rupture propagation simulations (e.g. Zhang et al., 2019; Zhu and Yuan, 2016), the actual complexity of the contemporary stress field in the area of the eastern Tibetan Plateau has been simplified to a uniform stress orientation and\/or magnitude. However, simulation results for the Wenchuan earthquake show that the rupture behavior is largely impacted by the background stress field imposed (Duan, 2010; Wen et al., 2012). In addition, the changes of Coulomb Failure Stress (\u25b3CFS) on optimally oriented faults, a criterion which is widely used to estimate the seismic hazard of faults due to a nearby earthquake, is also dramatically affected by the imposed background stress field (King et al., 1994). In this respect, obtaining the non-uniform three-dimensional (3D) crustal stress field of the eastern Tibetan Plateau incorporating complex fault geometries and heterogeneous rock properties is crucial and the key to improve the seismic hazard assessment and the accuracy of dynamic rupture simulation in the region.\nIn order to overcome the above mentioned limitations of the observational stress measurements, numerical modeling serves as an important tool. So far, in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, numerical modeling has been used mainly in time-dependent studies related to the seismic cycle for the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake, including its causes (2D) (Zhu and Zhang, 2013) and recurrence period (3D) (Liu et al., 2017a), the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault rupture process (2D) (Zhu and Yuan, 2016), the influence of crustal rheology on the earthquake (3D) (Liu et al., 2015) and the \u25b3CFS on the nearby active faults (3D) (Liu et al., 2018, 2020; Luo and Liu, 2010, 2018). However, regarding the time-independent stress field, i.e., the background stress field without temporal changes due to the seismic cycle, little modeling work has been done in this area so far.\nIn this paper, we present a 3D geomechanical-numerical model of the eastern Tibetan Plateau to obtain the spatially continuous description of the contemporary background stress field rather than a point-wise information on the stress state. This model incorporates structural complexities resulting from thickness changes in crustal layers and numerous faults and as well as the inhomogeneous rock property distribution. It provides the full stress tensor, i.e., the 3D contemporary background stress field at any point in the model domain. We use model-independent observation data, such as SH orientations, stress inversion of earthquake focal mechanisms and the tectonic regime revealed by focal mechanisms, to verify the reliability of the modeled stress results. Based on the modeling results, we further analyze the stress state of the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the main faults within this region, and discuss the implications of the stress results for the regional tectonic evolution and the assessment of the seismic hazard of the Xianshuihe fault.\n\n\n2\nBackground information regarding active faults\nThe tectonic setting of the eastern Tibetan Plateau is characterized by a complex fault system. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, the NW-SE-trending eastern Kunlun fault (F1) and the Xianshuihe fault (F2) initiate from the hinterland of the plateau in the west and extend far to the east. They finally intersect the NE-SW-trending Longmen Shan fault zone (F3-6) (i.e., the middle section of the \u201cNorth-South Seismic Belt\u201d) at a high angle. Geophysical investigations show that these faults are lithospheric-scale deep faults or block boundary faults (Jia et al., 2014; Li et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2017b; Wang et al., 2003b), which divide the study area into the Bayan Har Block, the Chuan-Dian Block, the Qaidam-Qilian Block and the Sichuan Basin (Zhang et al., 2003). Contrasting kinematic characteristics of each block make these block-bounding faults slip differently, as is indicated by the high slip rate of 10\u201315\u00a0mm\/a on the Xianshuihe fault (Allen et al., 1991; Bai et al., 2018) and the low-to-moderate slip rate of 2\u201310\u00a0mm\/a on the eastern Kunlun fault (Kirby et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2013). The difference in block kinematics also promoted the formation of the large topographic relief along the Longmen Shan fault zone (Burchfiel et al., 1995). In addition, most destructive earthquakes in the study area have occurred on these fault zones, causing many casualties and property losses. For example, the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake (2008) and the Lushan Ms7.0 earthquake (2013) occurred on the Longmen Shan fault zone, the Kangding Ms6.3 earthquake (2014) on the Xianshuihe fault and the Jiuzhaigou Ms7.0 earthquake (2017) occurred at the intersection of the eastern Kunlun fault and the Huya fault (F12) (Fig. 1).\n\n\n3\nModel set-up\nThe set-up of the 3D geomechanical-numerical model used for the analysis of the background stress field in the eastern Tibetan Plateau is exactly the same as described in Li et al. (2021). Some important model features are recapitulated hereinafter. The model is a finite element model solved by the commercial software Abaqus\u2122. It has a cuboid shape with 679\u00a0km\u00a0W-E (100\u00b0E-107\u00b0E) and 669\u00a0km\u00a0N-S (28.5\u00b0-34.5\u00b0N) extension and a thickness of ~70\u00a0km (Fig. 3\n). Its top surface represents the topographic relief which is constrained by the GTOPO30 global digital elevation model (USGS). From top to bottom, the model is divided into four layers, i.e., the upper, middle, lower crust and the top layer of the upper mantle. The depth and topology of the interfaces between these layers are taken from the CRUST1.0 model (Laske et al., 2013).\nA 3D fault system is embedded in the model (Fig. 3). The fault geometries are constrained by data from surface fault surveys (e.g. Deng et al., 2003; Taylor and Yin, 2009), deep seismic sounding profiles (e.g. Wang et al., 2003b), focal mechanism solutions (e.g. Li et al., 2019) as well as seismic tomography (e.g. Wang et al., 2011) and receiver functions (e.g. Liu et al., 2017b). According to the difference in depth extent, the faults implemented in the model can be divided into lithospheric-scale faults that penetrate the entire model down to a depth of ~70\u00a0km and crustal-scale faults terminate at the base of the upper crust at ~20\u00a0km. Further details can be derived from Table 1 of Li et al. (2021). There are ~2.91 million linear tetrahedral elements to be used to discretize the model domain with resolution of 1\u20132\u00a0km on the faults and\u00a0~\u00a010\u00a0km near the model boundaries. After meshing, the faults are defined by pairs of so-called contact surfaces. For each fault, the two surfaces can slip on each other governed by the Mohr-Coulomb friction law. We tested a series of effective friction coefficients ranging from 0 to 0.1 and chose 0.02 as the best value making a minimum misfit of GPS measurements and modeled kinematic results (Fig. 3 in Li et al., 2021).\nBased on geological features, the model domain is divided into two main tectonic units: the Songpan-Ganzi terrane (including Bayan Har Block, part of Chuan-Dian Block and Qaidam-Qilian Block) and the South China terrane (Sichuan Basin). Rock properties of each tectonic unit in the model are derived from P seismic wave velocities according to empirical relations (Brocher, 2005) (Table 2 in Li et al., 2021). After incorporating the initial stress state into the model (see the next section), we applied velocity boundary conditions to incorporate the tectonic loading process according to the GPS measurements obtained by Wang et al. (2017). The model time is set as 40,000\u00a0years, which is required to generate a proper contemporary state of stress until the accumulated displacements applied at the boundaries are propagated into the model (Li et al., 2021). Gravity is applied as a body force at an acceleration of 9.81\u00a0m\/s2. After this step, the modeled contemporary 3D background stress field with absolute stress values of the study area is achieved. For further details of the modeling work and the modeled kinematic results, the reader is referred to Li et al. (2021).\n\n\n4\nInitial stress state\nThe background stress state can be considered as the superposition of a reference stress state and tectonic stresses (Zang and Stephansson, 2009; Engelder, 2016). The reference stress state originates primarily from the crustal material subjected to gravity, and the tectonic stresses arise from the far-field stresses related to plate interactions. The reference stress state is thus a major component of the full 3D crustal stress field. It not only profoundly affects the stress state on the fault surface, but also controls failure of and movement along the fault for which frequently the Mohr-Coulomb friction law is assumed. Therefore, an appropriate reference stress state should be considered in geomechanical models (Hergert and Heidbach, 2011). Numerical models aiming at the stress state of the crust often focused on tectonic stresses neglecting an appropriate reference stress state. So far, stress models of the eastern Tibetan Plateau commonly assumed a uniaxial-strain reference stress state, in which no elongation occurs in the horizontal directions, and strain only occurs in the vertical direction due to gravity (e.g. Zhu et al., 2015; Zhu and Zhang, 2013). In this reference stress state, the ratio (k) of mean horizontal stress to vertical stress is related only to the Poisson's ratio of the rock:\n\n(1)\n\nk\n=\n\n\n\n\nS\nH\n\n+\n\nS\nh\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nS\nv\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u03bd\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere SH, Sh and Sv are the maximum horizontal, minimum horizontal and vertical stress, respectively, \u03bd is Poisson's ratio. For the typical \u03bd-value of 0.25, Eq. (1) gives k\u00a0=\u00a01\/3, which means that the vertical stress is considerably larger than the horizontal stress, implying that the crust is always dominated by an extensional tectonic regime (SV\u00a0>\u00a0SH\u00a0>\u00a0Sh). However, convergent regimes (SH\u00a0>\u00a0Sh\u00a0>\u00a0SV) and strike-slip regimes (SH\u00a0>\u00a0SV\u00a0>\u00a0Sh) are very common in the crust and even in extensional tectonic regimes, measured k-values are substantially larger than the 1\/3 predicted by the uniaxial-strain reference state (Hergert and Heidbach, 2011). Therefore, the uniaxial-strain reference state commonly used in previous studies is inadequate for models aiming at the full 3D stress state.\nIn this study, we use another analytical description of the reference stress state to define an initial stress state in the model. Sheorey (1994) proposed a reference stress state based on a spherical shell model, for which the k-value is defined as\n\n(2)\n\nk\n=\n0.25\n+\n7\nE\n\n\n0.001\n+\n1\n\/\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere E is the Young's modulus (GPa), z is the depth (m). This equation incorporates the earth's curvature, the rock property distribution and the thermal expansion coefficient of the crust and mantle and fits global stress measurement data (Hergert and Heidbach, 2011). In addition, the increasing k-value towards the surface predicted by Eq. (2) is also consistent with the variation pattern of the in-situ stress data observed in mainland China (Wang et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012).\nBefore applying lateral tectonic forces, an appropriate initial stress state is generated through an additional modeling technique developed by Hergert (2009). The initial stress is calibrated by a trial-and-error approach until the modeled k-values fit Eq. (2) well, as shown in Fig. 4\n. The modeled k-values from five test sites are extracted for this comparison. These sites are located far from model boundaries and faults (see Fig. 1), and are therefore least affected by stress perturbations due to boundary effects and fault movements. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the modeled initial stress generally matches well with the theoretical values (indicated by the black curve) according to Eq. (2), except that the test site in the Sichuan Basin (indicated by the blue curve) shows somewhat larger k-values than the theoretical predictions. We infer that this discrepancy results from the large crustal thickness difference between the Sichuan Basin and the eastern Tibetan Plateau (Teng et al., 2013) as well as the larger Young's Modulus of the Sichuan Basin than the other blocks. Since the model mainly focuses on the background stress field of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the slightly higher k-values in the Sichuan Basin have little effect on the final results in our area of interest. After the trial-and-error procedure, we use the initial stress state which fits best to the theoretical assumption of Sheorey (1994) for further modeling. In addition to this gravitational component of the stress field, kinematic boundary conditions are subsequently applied to simulate the tectonic forces. This ultimately results in a 3D model describing the contemporary background stress field of the study area.\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nStress orientation and stress regime\nAs mentioned in the introduction, a close relationship exists between the crustal stress state and earthquakes. In order to improve our knowledge of the stress environment in the eastern Tibetan Plateau in which earthquakes form, we analyze the modeled stresses at the average focal depth of the earthquakes in the study area. Relocation studies of the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake (Li et al., 2019), the 2014 Kangding Ms6.3 earthquake (Fang et al., 2015) and the 2017 Jiuzhaigou Ms7.0 earthquake (Fang et al., 2018) reveal that the main shocks and most of their aftershocks are shallower than ~20\u00a0km and that the average focal depth is ~10\u00a0km. Further considering the ~5\u00a0km average altitude of the eastern Tibetan Plateau (Burchfiel et al., 1995), the depth selected for slicing the model is therefore 5\u00a0km below sea level (bsl.). The resulting horizontal section (Fig. 5\n) shows the modeled maximum horizontal stress orientation and stress regime at this depth.\n\n5.1.1\nOrientation of maximum horizontal stress SH\n\nThe orientation of the maximum horizontal stress SH was calculated from the modeled stress tensor at the depth of 5\u00a0km (bsl.) using the method of Lund and Townend (2007). Subsequently, the calculated stress orientations were averaged on a grid with 20\u00a0km spacing in both width and length, using a statistical analysis (Mardia and Jupp, 2000, p. 15). Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the average orientations of SH. As can be seen, SH is mainly oriented NW-SE, but varies obviously in some local areas where the fault geometries are complex, such as the triple junction area between the Xianshuihe fault (F2) and the Longmen Shan fault zone (F3-F5), and the overlap zone of the eastern Kunlun fault (F1) and Diebu-Mianlue fault (F15). In addition, within some blocks, the SH orientation also changes noticeably. For example, for the Bayan Har Block, SH is nearly E-W in the west of the Longriqu fault (F8), but rotates clockwise to NW-SE in zones between the Longriqu fault (F8) and the Longmen Shan fault zone (F3-F5). For the Chuan-Dian Block, SH turns sharply from near parallel with to perpendicular to the Xianshuihe fault (F2). Nevertheless, the overall pattern of the modeled SH orientation reveals that the eastern Tibetan Plateau is dominated by a NW-SE-trending compression.\n\n\n5.1.2\nRegime stress ratio pattern\nIn order to quantify the spatial variation of the modeled style of faulting, we use the Regime Stress Ratio (RSR) parameter defined by Simpson (1997) to classify the background stress field in the study area. The RSR calculation formula is:\n\n(3)\n\nRSR\n=\n\n\nn\n+\n0.5\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\nR\n\u2212\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere R\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03c32-\u03c33)\/(\u03c31-\u03c33) is the stress shape parameter, n is the faulting type index, with values of 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to normal, strike-slip and reverse types, respectively. The RSR ranges between 0 and 3, indicating a continuous transition from normal faulting (0\u20131) through strike-slip (1\u20132) to thrust faulting (2\u20133). It should be noted that as a combination of the Andersonian faulting type and differential stresses, the RSR value only describes how an optimally oriented fault would slip (Hergert and Heidbach, 2011). If preexisting faults are not optimally oriented in the given stress field, the modeled type of faulting from RSR can deviate from the actual faulting type (C\u00e9l\u00e9rier, 1995).\nThe background colour in Fig. 5 shows the spatial distribution of the stress regimes. In general, the western part of the study area, including the Bayan Har Block and the Chuan-Dian Block, is dominated by a strike-slip faulting stress regime (1\u00a0<\u00a0RSR\u00a0<\u00a02); while in the eastern part, the Sichuan Basin is predominantly under a thrust faulting stress regime (2\u00a0<\u00a0RSR\u00a0<\u00a03), so is the Qaidam-Qilian Block. This distribution of the stress regimes is in good agreement with the existing tectonic structures in the study area. For example, the strike-slip faults including the Xianshuihe fault (F2), the eastern Kunlun fault (F1), the Longriqu fault (F8), the Maoergai fault (F9) and the Maerkang fault (F10) are all located in the western part where the strike-slip faulting stress regime is dominant. In contrast, compressional structures like the Xiongpo and Longquanshan anticlines in the Sichuan Basin (Fig. 1) have developed in the eastern part of the study area under the thrust faulting stress regime.\nSimilar to the SH orientations, the stress regime in the study area also display significant local variations. It can be seen from the Fig. 5 that there are two prominent areas with a normal faulting stress regime (0\u00a0<\u00a0RSR\u00a0<\u00a01) located along the Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault (F2) and the segment of the eastern Kunlun fault (F1) passing through the Ruoergai Basin, respectively. In addition, Fig. 5 also shows that stress regime changes occur in the vicinity of faults, such as near the Xianshuihe fault and eastern Kunlun fault, indicating that the fault geometry often plays an important role in the stress state near the fault. Therefore, stress measurements near faults may reflect more local stress field information rather than the regional background stress field (Hergert and Heidbach, 2011).\n\n\n\n5.2\nStress state along large faults\n\n5.2.1\nThe Longmen Shan fault zone\n\nFig. 6\n shows the detailed modeled SH orientations in the vicinity of the Longmen Shan fault zone as well as the normal and shear stresses on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (F4), which ruptured ~300\u00a0km during the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake. Fig. 6a shows that SH is oriented almost perpendicular to the fault strike in the southwestern segment, and gradually changes northeastward to oblique to the strike with an acute angle of ~45\u00b0. Besides, comparing the orientations of SH and GPS measurements shows that SH is nearly parallel to the movements observed by GPS, implying that the direction of the tectonic forces is generally consistent with the crustal kinematics in the area.\nIf SH is decomposed into a normal and shear stress component on the Longmen Shan fault zone, we expect from the orientation of SH that the normal stress on the southwestern segment should be higher than on the northeastern segment. In contrast, the shear stress should be lower than on the northeastern segment, due to the change of the angle between the SH and the fault strike (Fig. 5, 6a). These trends are in line with our modeled normal and shear stresses on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (Fig. 6b, c). As shown in Fig. 6b, divided by Beichuan, the normal stress on the southwestern segment is significantly higher than that on the northeastern segment. For example, at depths of about \u221210 to \u221215\u00a0km, the normal stress on the southwestern segment is about 350\u2013550\u00a0MPa, while to the northeast, it decreases to 300\u2013450\u00a0MPa. Contrary to the normal stress distribution, the shear stress on the southwestern segment is lower than that on the northeastern segment (Fig. 6c). This stress state on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault would make the northeastern segment more prone to slip due to its higher shear stress and lower normal stress than the southwestern segment. This may provide a potential mechanism to explain why the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake ruptured an ultra-long distance of ~300\u00a0km of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault unilaterally from SW to NE. Subsection 6.2 will give a more detailed discussion on this interpretation.\n\n\n5.2.2\nThe Xianshuihe fault\n\nFig. 7\n presents the distribution of the modeled SH in the vicinity of the Xianshuihe fault as well as the stress state on the fault surface. Modeling results clearly indicate that near the city of Kangding the Xianshuihe fault can be divided into two segments. On the northwestern segment (Luhuo-Kangding), the SH orientation is nearly parallel or at a low angle to the strike of the fault, whereas on the southeastern segment (Kangding-Shimian), SH is nearly perpendicular to the fault strike (Fig. 7a). Different from the preceding Longmen Shan fault zone, the SH orientation along the Xianshuihe fault is not always consistent with the crustal movement determined by GPS measurements. Especially on the southeastern segment there is a significant deviation between the two (Fig. 7a). This deviation indicates that the stress field near a fault is probably better reflected by the fault geometry rather than the crustal kinematics. It should therefore be noted that strain information only is not sufficient to lead to a reasonable seismic hazard assessment, unless comprehensive information of the stress state and fault structure is incorporated.\nThe significant transpressional stress state (Fig. 5) with a high angle between SH and fault strike (Fig. 7a) on the southeastern segment of the Xianshuihe fault subjects this segment to a higher normal stress (Fig. 7b). This results in a stronger frictional resistance of the fault surface and provides an explanation for the observed decrease in slip rate on this fault segment from ~10\u00a0mm\/a to ~7\u00a0mm\/a (Li et al., 2021). Higher normal stress on the southeastern segment implies higher frictional resistance, which in turn requires higher critical shear stress to overcome, as shown in Fig. 7c. In this respect, we infer that earthquake recurrence time of the southeastern segment should be longer than that of the northwestern segment, which is consistent with paleoseismic records for the Xianshuihe fault. According to paleosesimic records, the recurrence interval of the southeastern segment for an event size range of M7\u20137.5 is up to ~460\u00a0years, and for the northwestern segment the interval is several decades to 200\u00a0years for M6.5\u20137.5 events (Wen et al., 2008) (Fig. 7a). In addition, higher normal stress and critical shear stress on the southeastern segment is conducive for the fault to accumulate higher strain energy, which means a large earthquake might be under development on this segment, especially if the significant slip rate (~9\u00a0mm\/a) is considered (Li et al., 2021).\nIt is worth noting that there is a prominent low normal stress area on the Bamei-Kangding segment (Fig. 7b). An in-depth discussion on its causes, tectonic significance and seismic hazard will be given in Subsections 6.3 and 6.4.\n\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nComparison of modeled stress results with model-independent stress data\nTo validate the model, here we compare the modeled stress results with model-independent stress data, such as SH orientations, faulting mechanisms and inverted stress from earthquake focal mechanisms. In addition, for details on comparisons between the modeled kinematic results and independent geodetic or geological observations (e.g. GPS and reported fault slip rates) we refer to Li et al. (2021).\n\n6.1.1\nComparison with SH orientations from the WSM\nThe World Stress Map (WSM) database provides abundant SH orientations that are derived from, among others, in-situ stress measurements, earthquake focal mechanisms and young geologic data (Heidbach et al., 2016). We chose stress orientations of quality A\u2013C (with error\u00a0\u2264\u00a025\u00b0) from the WSM database and divided them into many small subregions according to their locations, with 0.2\u00b0 spacing both in longitude and latitude. Then the SH data within 20\u00a0km from each grid point was selected as input data to calculate the average SH orientation of that subregion (see Heidbach et al., 2008 for the methodology). Fig. 5 shows the results of the mean SH orientation.\nOverall, the modeled SH orientations are in good agreement with the WSM data, especially in the Chuan-Dian Block (west of Kangding), the southwestern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone (near Lushan and Anxian), the north of the Huya fault (F12) and the Qingchuan fault (F7). Although some discrepancies between modeled and observed orientations are recognized near Yingxiu and Beichuan, they are only local, and may be caused by detailed structures which are not captured by our model. The average difference of SH orientation between the model results and the WSM data is 23.8\u00b0. This difference is slightly smaller than the error (\u00b125\u00b0) of SH orientation from focal mechanism solutions, which constitutes the main part of the WSM database in this region (Fig. 2). Therefore, the comparison of SH orientation indicates that our modeled results generally compare well with the WSM data.\n\n\n6.1.2\nComparison with faulting mechanisms from earthquake focal mechanisms\nEarthquake focal mechanism solutions contain much information about the kinematics of the seismogenic fault and the stress state in the vicinity of the hypocenter. In our model, the focal mechanism solution is only used to constrain the fault geometries, but is not used to constrain the modeled stress. Thus, it can be regarded as model-independent data to evaluate the modeled stress field. Assuming that an earthquake prefers to occur on an optimally oriented fault under a given stress condition, then the focal mechanism is closely related to the stress field and can be used to test the accuracy of our modeled stress results. We collected 552 focal mechanisms of earthquakes (M\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.1) that occurred in the study area between 1960 and 2020 (Table S1), classified them by tectonic regime (Zoback, 1992) and compared them with the RSR results obtained by our model. Fig. 8\n shows the distribution and different types of these focal mechanisms.\nAs can be seen, strike-slip faulting earthquakes are widely distributed in the western part of the study area, such as within and at the edges of the Bayan Har Block. This is also the region for which the modeling results show a predominant strike-slip faulting stress regime (1\u00a0<\u00a0RSR\u00a0<\u00a02). Thrust faulting earthquakes are mainly located in the eastern part of the study area, such as the Sichuan Basin and the Qaidam-Qilian Block. There the modeled stress field is characterized by a thrust faulting stress regime (2\u00a0<\u00a0RSR\u00a0<\u00a03). These comparisons show that our modeled stress regimes fit well to those revealed by focal mechanisms. Similar to the preceding SH orientation, some local inconsistencies also exist. For example, the modeled stress regime of the Chuan-Dian Block is strike-slip, but focal mechanisms of the earthquakes there are normal faulting. The tectonic map (Fig. 1) shows that there are no fault traces in this area except for two NE- and NW-trending secondary faults respectively on its east and west sides. In this situation, normal faulting earthquakes can be assumed to nucleate easier than strike-slip or thrust events due to the lower normal stress on the fault. These factors may cause the discrepancy between the normal faulting events and the modeled strike-slip stress regime. Nevertheless, the nearly E-W-trending nodal planes of these normal faulting events reveal a N-S-trending extension, which is consistent with our modeled, nearly N-S-trending minimum horizontal stress (see Fig. 5).\n\n\n6.1.3\nComparison with stress field inverted from focal mechanism solutions\nBased on the focal mechanisms in Fig. 8, we calculated the stress field (Fig. S1) with a grid interval of 0.2\u00b0 both in longitude and latitude using a damped linear stress inversion method (Hardebeck and Michael, 2006), and then compared the stress field from the inversion with the modeled principal stress axes (\u03c31\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c33) with respect to their trend and plunge (Fig. 9\n). From Fig. 9 it can be seen that the modeled principal stress axes (white dots) are in exceptionally good agreement with the predominant orientations of the three principal stress axes (gray crosses) obtained by the focal mechanism inversion. For example, both the inversion and the modeled stress results show that \u03c31 is almost horizontal and oriented preferentially in the WNW-ESE direction, reflecting a compression caused by the southeastward movement of the Bayan Har Block. \u03c32 from the stress inversion is concentrated mainly in the NNE-SSW and near-vertical directions, which compares well with our simulation results. For \u03c33, the predominant orientation is nearly vertical, with minor occurrences of a horizontal axis with N-S trends. According to Anderson's theory of faulting (Anderson, 1905), such characteristics of the principal stress axes reflect that the study area is dominated by a thrust faulting regime (\u03c33 is near vertical) and a strike-slip faulting regime (\u03c32 is near vertical), which is consistent with the RSR pattern and the main focal types of earthquakes in the study area (Fig. 8).\nIn addition, we also calculated the Kagan angle for each pair of modeled and inverted stress tensors (see Fig. 10\n). The Kagan angle is defined as the minimum angle of rotation from the principal axes of one stress tensor to the corresponding principal axes of the other in 3-D which varies from 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0. The smaller the Kagan angle is, the better is the fit of the two stress tensors. Lee et al. (2014) suggested that the two stress tensors of a pair can be considered similar if their Kagan angle is less than 50\u00b0. According to this criterion, from Fig. 10 we can see that most of the rotated angles are smaller than 50\u00b0 (about 70%), which indicates that the modeled stress field is very close to the inverted stress field.\n\n\n\n6.2\nMechanism of the ultra-long unilateral rupture of the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake\nPost-earthquake field investigations showed that the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake ruptured simultaneously the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (F4) and the Anxian-Guanxian fault (F5) with 240\u00a0km and 72\u00a0km, respectively (Xu et al., 2009) (Fig. 1). Lin et al. (2012) found that the Qingchuan fault (F7) also ruptured during the Wenchuan earthquake, thus extending the coseismic surface rupture length of the Wenchuan earthquake up to ~300\u00a0km. This rupture length is consistent with the subsurface rupture length of ~330\u00a0km, which is obtained by relocation of the aftershocks within two months after the mainshock (Huang et al., 2008).\nAccording to the empirical relationship between magnitude and fault rupture length (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994), the surface and subsurface rupture lengths caused by the Wenchuan Ms8.0 (Mw7.9) earthquake should be ~170\u00a0km. However, these estimates are significantly smaller than the actual rupture length of 300\u2013330\u00a0km. Furthermore, the comparison of the rupture length of the Wenchuan earthquake with the rupture lengths of other large thrust or transpressional faulting earthquakes, such as the 2015 Nepal Mw7.8 earthquake (~140\u00a0km) (Avouac et al., 2015) and the 2016 New Zealand Mw7.8 earthquake (~170\u00a0km) (Hamling et al., 2017), also shows that the Wenchuan earthquake produced an ultra-long coseismic rupture zone. In addition, another interesting characteristic of the rupture of the Wenchuan earthquake is that it initiated at the epicenter of the mainshock and propagated almost unilaterally towards the northeast for about 300\u00a0km. In contrast, to the southwest of the epicenter it terminated abruptly after a rather short distance (< 10\u00a0km) (Fig. 1).\nAt present, the cause of this ultra-long unilateral rupture is still debated. Zhu and Yuan (2016) suggested that the large stiffness contrast between the wall rocks on the two sides of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault is a key parameter for the unilateral rupture propagation. Jin et al. (2019) calculated the \u25b3CFS on each sub-segment of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault and found that the former ruptured sub-segment can trigger the rupture of the subsequent sub-segment adjacent to it, thus causing the fault to rupture unilaterally from SW to NE. Xu et al. (2018) attributed the ultra-long rupture to the exceptionally low friction coefficient (~0.02) on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (Li et al., 2015).\nBased on the model results, we consider that the contemporary background stress field plays a key role in the formation of the ultra-long unilateral rupture of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault. The coseismic horizontal displacements measured by GPS show that the stations on the west side (hanging wall) of the rupture zone moved eastward, southeastward, and northeastward, whereas the stations on the east side (footwall) of the fault moved westward and northwestward with a maximum horizontal displacement of ~2.5\u00a0m (Zhang et al., 2010). This indicates that strong crustal stresses had been accumulated on the entire Yingxiu-Beichuan fault prior to the earthquake. Our modeled stress on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault shows that, roughly divided by Beichuan, the normal stress on the northeastern segment is smaller than that on the southwestern one, whereas the shear stress is higher on the northeastern segment than on the southwestern segment (Fig. 6). To show the variations of the stress state along the fault strike more clearly, we extracted the normal stress and shear stress at four depths, i.e., at 0\u00a0km, \u22125\u00a0km, \u221210\u00a0km, and\u00a0\u2212\u00a015\u00a0km bsl. on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (Fig. 11\n). It can be clearly seen that at different depths, the normal stress on the northeastern side of Beichuan is smaller than that on the southwestern side (Fig. 11a), especially at the depth of \u221215\u00a0km. There the normal stress on the northeastern segment is about 420\u00a0MPa, which is significantly less than the normal stress of ~500\u00a0MPa on the southwestern segment. Contrary to the normal stress distribution, the shear stress on the northeastern segment is significantly higher than that on the southwestern segment (Fig. 11b). For example, at \u221215\u00a0km depth, the northeastern segment has a maximum shear stress value of 50\u00a0MPa, while the shear stress on the southwestern segment is substantially lower, i.e., in the range of 10\u201318\u00a0MPa. Moreover, stress on the fault at other depths within the range of 2\u20135\u00a0km (corresponding to 2\u20134 element layers in the model) from the bottom boundary of the fault beneath Beichuan, where a boundary effect would be relatively low, also shows a similar distribution characteristic (Fig. S2).\nThe higher normal stress on the southwestern segment of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault will produce a stronger frictional resistance, making this segment less prone to rupture. On the contrary, the lower normal stress on the northeastern segment means less frictional resistance to overcome; furthermore, the shear stress on this segment is higher. This stress state will facilitate slip on the northeastern segment. Therefore, we infer that when the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake initiated on the southwestern segment of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault, the stress perturbation caused by the earthquake favored the rupture to propagate in the direction of decreasing frictional resistance and increasing shear stress, i.e., in northeastward direction. In contrast, on the southwestern segment, where the normal stress is high and the shear stress is low, rupturing was quickly suppressed. We suggest that this difference in the background stress field on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault eventually formed the unilateral ultra-long rupture in the Wenchuan earthquake.\n\n\n6.3\nNormal faulting stress regime of the Xianshuihe fault and its tectonic significance\nThe Xianshuihe fault (F2) is a large lithospheric-scale fault (Wang et al., 2003b) that divides the Songpan-Ganzi terrane into the Bayan Har Block on the northeastern side and the Chuan-Dian Block on the southwestern side (Fig. 1). This fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault that is generally oriented in NW-SE direction. Divided by Bamei, the northwestern segment of the Xianshuihe fault has a relatively simple geometry with secondary faults at a consistent orientation of NW-SE (Fig. 1). On the contrary, the southeastern segment exhibits a complex structure where the fault splits into the three branches of the Yalahe fault, the Selaha fault and the Zheduotang fault between Bamei and Kangding, and again becomes a single fault after crossing Kangding and extending southward to Shimian (Fig. 12\n). Moreover, from Kangding to Shimian, the fault strike rotates ~40\u00b0 clockwise from NW-SE to near N-S.\n\n6.3.1\nNormal faulting stress regime on the Bamei-Kangding segment\n\nFig. 12 shows that a prominent normal faulting stress regime (0\u00a0<\u00a0RSR\u00a0<\u00a01) exists in the area between Bamei and Kangding, which extends northward to the southwest flank of the Danba anticline and eastward to the southwestern end of the Longmen Shan fault zone. Several model-independent observations provide evidence for this normal faulting stress regime. For example, the strain field of the Tibetan Plateau derived from GPS velocities shows that this area is dominated by an extensional environment (Cheng et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2007), which is consistent with the modeled normal faulting stress regime. In addition, a dense number of hot springs located between Bamei and Kangding (Tang et al., 2017) indicates that the fault zone in this area is rather permeable and can provide pathways for the ascent of geothermal water \u2013 a feature typical for areas with normal faulting stress regimes (Egger et al., 2014). Recently, active fault investigations discovered that there is a 24\u00a0km-long Holocene transtensional fault in the Zheduoshan granite between the Selaha fault and Zheduotang fault (Fig. 12) (Pan et al., 2020). This provides the most direct evidence for the normal faulting stress regime in the area. Wang et al. (1997) also deduced that there should be an extensional zone in the Bamei-Kangding area to provide space for the emplacement of the Cenozoic Zheduoshan granite.\nAlthough this modeled normal faulting stress regime seems to be in contradiction with the strike-slip faulting mechanisms on the Bamei-Kangding segment (see Fig. 8), the very same model yields almost pure strike-slip motion on this segment (Li et al., 2021), which is in agreement with the strike-slip faulting mechanisms. As mentioned in Subsection 5.1.2, the RSR value only reflects the true stress regime if the faults are optimally oriented in the given stress field. According to Hergert and Heidbach (2011), focal mechanisms on preexisting non-optimally oriented faults have the potential to reflect the kinematics of slip on and the geometry of the fault rather than the stress field. For instance, slip on a vertical fault will occur in a strike-slip sense even though the stress regime may exhibit components of normal or thrust faulting (C\u00e9l\u00e9rier, 1995). The Xianshuihe fault implemented in our model is almost vertical (Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2003a, 2003b), so the discrepancy between the modeled stress regime and the focal mechanism solutions is reasonable.\nThe normal faulting stress regime on the Bamei-Kangding segment and further to the north is considered to be caused by clockwise rotation of the left-lateral Xianshuihe fault from NW-SE to NNW-SSE near Kangding (Li et al., 2021). This change in strike increases the southward component of the crustal movement of the Chuan-Dian Block, which in turn stretches the crust adjacent to the restraining bend (Kangding-Shimian) (Fig. 12), forming the normal faulting stress regime. We speculate that this normal faulting regime may be also an important factor that caused the Xianshuihe fault to split into three branches of Yalahe, Selaha and Zheduotang in the Bamei-Kangding area. This speculation however needs to be verified by further work, i.e., combined finite discrete element simulations, in the future.\n\n\n6.3.2\nTectonic significance of the normal faulting stress regime\nA Cenozoic granitic massif, named Zheduoshan (or Gonggashan) granite, crops out in the area of the modeled normal faulting stress regime predicted for the Bamei-Kangding segment. It is about 180\u00a0km long and 7\u201320\u00a0km wide and is cut by several secondary faults (Fig. 12). Geochronological studies suggest that the emplacement of the granite occurred at ~12\u00a0Ma and was synchronous with strike-slip movement of the Xianshuihe fault (Roger et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 2004). Geochemical characteristics reveal that the source of the granite is crustal material (Lai and Zhao, 2018; Liu et al., 2006), and some rocks are sourced from partial melting of mafic rocks in the lower crust (Hu et al., 2020).\nIn terms of a heat source promoting partial melting, some studies suggest the strong shear heat generated during left-lateral strike-slip of the Xianshuihe fault as cause (Wang and Xu, 1996; Wu et al., 2016a). However, it is worth noting that on the northwestern segment of the Xianshuihe fault, which slips at a higher rate of ~15\u00a0mm\/a (Allen et al., 1991), hence, shear heating should be stronger, no Cenozoic granite intrusions are found. However, on the Bamei-Kangding segment where the slip rate is low, about ~5\u00a0mm\/a on each branch (Allen et al., 1991; Bai et al., 2018), the Zheduoshan granite has developed. This phenomenon indicates that shear heating may not be the main reason of the partial melting of the crust in the Bamei-Kangding area.\nWe infer that the heat for the formation of the Zheduoshan granite mainly comes from the deep. S-wave receiver function results show that there is an asthenosphere upwelling structure beneath the Bayan Har Block along the west side of the Longmen Shan fault zone (Hu et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2020). Above it, extensive high-conductivity and low-velocity bodies are found in the middle and lower crust of the Bayan Har Block (Bai et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012), indicating that rocks there are rich in fluids with low viscosity and easy to flow. Moreover, deep seismic sounding results show that the Xianshuihe fault is a lithospheric-scale fault that cuts through the Moho (Wang et al., 2003b), which provides a channel for convective heat transfer from deep sources and upwelling of hot material and hydrothermal fluid materials, respectively.\n\nFig. 13\n illustrates schematically how we envisage the deep dynamic processes in the vicinity of the Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault. Upwelling of the asthenosphere beneath the Bayan Har Block heated the bottom of the crust and promoted the formation of the low-velocity bodies (LVB) in the middle and lower crust. Serving as a channel, the Xianshuihe fault also transported heat and material upward, thus prompting further partial melting of the crust. At the same time, the extensional environment indicated by the normal faulting stress of the Bamei-Kangding segment, which formed after the initiation of sinistral slip along the Xianshuihe fault, created space for magma emplacement, finally forming the Zheduoshan granite. Deep heat and hydrothermal fluids ascended up to shallow crustal levels along the Xianshuihe fault, heating the groundwater, and then forming those high-temperature hot springs densely distributed along the Bamei-Kangding segment (Fig. 12). The geochemical characteristics of the hot spring gas clearly show that mantle fluids have migrated into the crust near Kangding (Zhou et al., 2015), which provides further evidence for the dynamic process described above.\nIn addition to providing space for the emplacement of the Zheduoshan granite, the normal faulting stress field in the Bamei-Kangding area may also affect the evolution of the Danba anticline (Fig. 12). Using low-temperature thermochronological data, Tan et al. (2017) found that the Danba anticline has rapidly uplifted since ~12\u00a0Ma, which is consistent with the start time of the left-lateral strike-slip movement of the Xianshuihe fault and the emplacement age of the Zheduoshan granite (Roger et al., 1995). In addition, the uplift rate of the southwestern limb of the Danba anticline is significantly higher than that of the northeastern limb. Therefore, we deduce that the normal faulting stress regime on the Bami-Kangding segment and the related ascent and emplacement of the Zheduoshan granite together promoted the rapid uplift of the southwestern limb of the Danba anticline (see Fig. 13).\nIn summary, due to the clockwise rotation of the strike of the Xianshuihe fault from NW-SE to NNW-SSE at Kangding, a local extensional environment was formed in the Bamei-Kangding area, which played a key role in the regional tectonic evolution. On the one hand, the normal faulting stress regime opened a window for the upwelling of crustal materials, promoting the transfer of heat and hydrothermal fluids from deep to shallow depths along the Xianshuihe fault. This resulted not only in heating of crustal rocks and partial melting, but also created the space necessary for the emplacement of the Zheduoshan granite. On the other hand, the upward emplacement of the Zheduoshan granite further contributed to the rapid uplift of the southwestern limb of the Danba anticline. These phenomena and analyses illustrate that a large-scale horizontal movement of the crust can cause a significant vertical movement in local areas within a geological time span of millions of years.\n\n\n\n6.4\nSeismic hazard of the Xianshuihe fault\nThe Xianshuihe left-lateral strike-slip fault is one of the most active intra-continental faults in China. Its high activity is comparable to other large strike-slip fault systems in the world, such as the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey, the San Andreas fault in California and the Alpine Fault in New Zealand (Allen et al., 1991). According to historical documents and modern instrumental records at least 16 earthquakes with magnitude\u00a0\u2265\u00a0M6.5 (including 8 earthquakes with magnitude \u2265M7.0) have occurred on this fault since 1327 (Fig. 7a) (Wen et al., 2008). The most recent strong earthquake is the Daofu Ms6.9 earthquake in 1981, and the most recent moderately strong earthquakes are the Kangding Ms6.3 and Ms5.8 earthquakes in 2014 (Fig. 1) (Fang et al., 2015).\nAlong the Xianshuihe fault, there are many densely populated cities, especially at the southeastern segment of the fault, where the tourist cities of Kangding and Moxi are located. In order to effectively reduce the risk of earthquake disasters in this area and prepare emergency plans in advance, many studies have been carried out to assess the seismic hazard of the Xianshuihe fault from multiple aspects, such as calculation of \u25b3CFS on the fault (Fang et al., 2015; Papadimitriou et al., 2004; Parsons et al., 2008; Toda et al., 2008; Wan and Shen, 2010), analysis of historical seismic activity (Wen et al., 2008), geodetic surveys (Jiang et al., 2015) and estimation of the long-term fault slip rate (Bai et al., 2018). Papadimitriou et al. (2004) calculated the cumulative \u25b3CFS produced by coseismic displacements and interseismic tectonic loading of historical earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault. Their results show that the fault segment between Kangding and Shimian (i.e., the Moxi fault) and the northern part of the Bamei-Kangding segment have positive values of \u25b3CFS, indicating that these segments move towards failure. The \u25b3CFS changes caused by the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake show that this earthquake has brought the Daofu-Bamei-Kangding segment closer to failure (Parsons et al., 2008; Toda et al., 2008; Wan and Shen, 2010). Shan et al. (2013) considered the impact of post-seismic relaxation in viscoelastic rock on \u25b3CFS, but wrongly took two normal faulting earthquakes located at the northern end of the Xianshuihe fault as thrusting events, namely the 1811 M6.75 earthquake and the 1967 M6.8 earthquake (Molnar and Lyon-Caent, 1989; Zhou et al., 1983; Wen et al., 2008). Therefore, the \u25b3CFS they calculated for the Xianshuihe fault may be incorrect, at least the \u25b3CFS values near the northern end of the Xianshuihe fault. The same error also exists in similar work of Liu et al. (2018, 2020). Wen et al. (2008) found that no strong earthquakes have occurred on the northern part of the Bamei-Kangding segment since 1748, and treated this segment as a seismic gap. Jiang et al. (2015) used geodetic data to invert the interseismic coupling ratio distribution on the Xianshuihe fault and found that a potential seismogenic asperity exists on the Songlinkou-Selaha segment (namely the middle part of Daofu-Kangding segment). They considered that this segment is very close to rupture. Bai et al. (2018) used the long-term slip rate of the Selaha fault to estimate its hazard and suggested that this fault could still generate a Mw6.5\u20136.8 earthquake after the 2014 Kangding earthquakes.\nFor a reasonable evaluation of the seismic hazard of faults comprehensive data sets are required (Zhang, 2013). Since an earthquake is the result of instability under the action of stress that exceeds the ultimate rock strength, obtaining information on the contemporary background stress state on faults can provide a mechanical basis for the analysis of seismic hazard (e.g. Hergert and Heidbach, 2011). Our modeled stress results show that the Moxi fault (Kangding-Shimian segment) has higher normal stress and higher shear stress (Fig. 7b, c), which means that this segment can store higher strain energy for a large earthquake. Considering that the long-term average slip rate of the Moxi fault is as high as ~9\u00a0mm\/a (Li et al., 2021), the strain energy accumulated since the last 1786 Ms7.75 earthquake is large enough to produce a Ms7.4 earthquake (Li et al., 2021).\nThe lower normal stress on the Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault (Fig. 7b) means a small frictional resistance on the fault surface. Additionally, the extensional stress regime in this area promotes fluid infiltration into the fault zone (Fig. 13), thus making the fault slip more easily. Therefore, it is harder to accumulate large enough stress on the Bamei-Kangding segment to produce a large earthquake. Instead, frequent earthquakes with small to moderate magnitude are more likely. The 2014 Kangding Ms6.3 and Ms5.8 moderate earthquakes that occurred on this segment seem to confirm this speculation. Although the Zheduotang fault (see Fig. 12) has experienced a M7.5 earthquake in 1955, the latest field investigation indicates that this magnitude may be overestimated (Yan et al., 2020).\nIn summary, based on the modeled stress results, we suggest that the Moxi fault has a potential to generate a large earthquake with a magnitude of Ms7.4, while the Bamei-Kangding segment prefers to produce frequent earthquakes with small to moderate magnitude. The longer earthquake recurrence interval of the Moxi fault (460\u00a0years) than that of the Bami-Kangding segment (85\u00a0years) (Wen et al., 2008) also provides evidence for this interpretation.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nIn this study, we analyze the results of a geomechanical-numerical model regarding the contemporary 3D crustal background stress field of the eastern Tibetan Plateau and compare them to model-independent stress data. In general, the modeled SH is oriented in NW-SE direction, indicating that the study area is mainly subjected to a NW-SE compression. The Bayan Har Block and the Chuan-Dian Block are dominated by a strike-slip faulting stress regime. However, in some local areas, such as the Bamei-Kangding area and the northern part of the Ruoergai Basin, the crust is governed by a normal faulting regime.\nThe stress state on the Longmen Shan fault zone is inhomogeneous. For the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault, roughly divided by Beichuan, the SH orientation is nearly perpendicular to the southwestern segment, but to the north it gradually becomes oblique to the northeastern segment. This variation of the SH orientation makes the normal stress on the northeastern segment lower than that on the southwestern segment, which means the frictional resistance decreases northeastward along the fault. In addition, the higher shear stress on the northeastern segment promotes rupturing of this segment. We propose that this inhomogeneous stress state on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault can explain the formation and northeastward propagation of the ultra-long unilateral rupture of the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake.\nThe local normal faulting stress regime in the Bamei-Kangding area, representing an extensional zone, is inferred to be caused by the clockwise rotation of the strike of the Xianshuihe fault at Kangding from NW-SE to NNW-SSE. This extensional zone opened a window for upwelling of heat and material along the Xianshuihe fault resulting not only in heating and partial melting of the crust, but also providing the necessary space for the emplacement of the Zheduoshan granite. In addition, these dynamic processes in the deep crust also induced the rapid uplift of the southwestern limb of the Danba Anticline. This indicates that the large-scale horizontal movement of the crust in the eastern Tibetan Plateau can cause significant vertical movements in local areas within a geological time span of a few millions of years.\nAccording to the stress state on the Xianshuihe fault, we suggest that the Kangding-Shimian segment (namely the Moxi fault) has a high potential to produce a strong earthquake with magnitude of Ms7.4 due to its high normal stress and a fast slip rate (~9\u00a0mm\/a) and should be carefully monitored. The Bami-Kangding segment, which is governed by a normal faulting stress regime and may be lubricated by fluids, seems to be more prone to reactivation and likely generates more frequent earthquakes with small to moderate magnitude.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nXianrui Li: modeling, results analysis, manuscript preparation Tobias Hergert: software usage guiding, idea discussion, manuscript editing Andreas Henk: providing computing platforms, idea discussion, manuscript editing Zuoxun Zeng: idea discussion.\n\n","127":"","128":"","129":"","130":"","131":"","132":"","133":"","134":"","135":"","136":"","137":"","138":"","139":"","140":"","141":"","142":"","143":"","144":"","145":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Deccan volcanic province (DVP) is the largest continental volcanic province of the world, located in the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent. The DVP, with an area more than 500,000 km2, is one of the most seismically active intraplate regions of the world and is associated with episodic swarm activity (Singh et al., 2017). The Indian monsoon lasts 2\u20134 months and supplies the Hiran river, which passes through the seismologically active regions of Talala. The river is collected in two different dams (Hiran I and II) for a few weeks to a few months each year (Hainzl et al., 2015). A temporal correlation between monsoon rainfall and seismic activity shows that swarm-like activity occurs during and shortly after the monsoon (Singh and Mishra, 2015). Hainzl et al. (2015) used hydraulic parameters from the river and the water reservoirs to investigate possible earthquake triggering mechanisms and found a statistical correlation between hydraulic observable and the seismic activity. These authors reveal that high precipitation during the monsoon leads to pore pressure changes in the shallow crust, which triggers seismic activity at greater depth. Other studies show that seismicity is caused by stress perturbations along pre-existing faults of Proterozoic and Mesozoic age (Yadav et al., 2011; Rastogi et al., 2013), while another hypothesis suggests that seismicity might be linked to volcanic degassing (Mahesh and Gupta, 2016). In this work, we conducted geophysical surveys to image structures in the subsurface to constrain possible triggering mechanisms for the observed seismicity and to better understand the underlying geodynamic processes in the region. Subsequently, the revealed underground structure has been implemented in a numerical model of non-linear pore pressure diffusion to investigate the influence of the newly identified fault zone on the pore pressure diffusion after the monsoon period.\n\n\n2\nGeology\nThe DVP, formed from eruptions of a large volume of Deccan flood basalt, is the largest continental flood basalt volcanic province of the world (Cox, 1989; White and McKenzie, 1989). The general stratigraphy of the peninsula consists of a Precambrian basement overlain by Mesozoic sediments, Deccan Trap basaltic flows, and a thin cover of neogone and quaternary sediments (Singh et al., 2012) (Fig. 1\na). There are also various volcanic plugs of acidic, alkaline and mafic types along the entire Saurashtra peninsula (Chandrasekhar et al., 2002). These plugs are volcanic objects created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano. One of the volcanic plugs in the western part of the Saurashtra peninsula is identified by a magnetic anomaly, electric resistivity and magnetotelluric surveys, and is known as the Junagadh plug (Chandrasekhar et al., 2005; Sarma et al., 2004; Dey et al., 2004). The Talala region is located in the Junagadh district, within the uplifted horst province of Gujarat, with Deccan volcanics forming plateaus and concical ridges.\nThe Deccan volcanics consist of major types of basalt, rhyolite, gabbro and granophyres, and trend in a NNW to NW and NNE direction (Cox, 1989). One of the most active faults known in the region is the Girnar Fault, which trends NE\u2013SW (Rastogi et al., 2013; Gandhi et al., 2015). Four moderate-sized earthquakes occurred in the vicinity of the Girnar Fault soon after the monsoon season in 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2011 (Rastogi et al., 2013). Monsoon rains increased the water levels in two large reservoirs by approximately 10\u201370 m, and it was suggested that percolated rainwater infiltrated rapidly into the subsurface through extensional fractures. The infiltrated water is suspected to have triggered the seismic events by increasing pore fluid pressure and thus reducing the effective normal stress (Chinnasamy et al., 2013). Earthquakes are recorded by the Gujarat seismic network (GSNet) operated by the institute of seismological research, Gandhinagar, Gujarat. From 2001 to 2012, several thousand earthquakes were reported by the public, and thousands more were recorded by the seismic network. Hundreds of events were in the magnitude range \n1.0\n<\n\nM\nw\n\n<\n5.1\n.\n\n\n3\nSeismicity in Talala\nThe study area is continuously monitored by the GSNet. This network covers an area of approximately 196,000 km2 (Chopra et al., 2008). Eighteen of the seismographs are installed in double-walled, thermally insulated vaults; 14 are located on fresh, unweathered rock reached after a few meters of excavation, and four are located on hard soil. All instruments are recording continuously for 24h. The determination of the hypocenters in the Talala region has been conducted with the earthquake analysis software SEISAN. It identifies the different seismic phases and re-locates an event with the three-component method. The catalog of seismic events has been provided by the Institute of Seismological Research in Gujarat to this study without an uncertainty estimation for the depth value. The magnitude of completeness (Mc) is 1 and was estimated by fitting a Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) model to the observed frequency-magnitude distribution (FMD). Fig. 1b shows over 600 earthquakes in the Talala region between 2007 and 2012, which tend to migrate from NE to SW but are likely concentrated in the SW. Fig. 2\na shows the monthly earthquake occurrence from 2007 to 2012 superposed on the precipitation per month. Most earthquakes occur between October and November, followed by a few seismic activities in December, January and February. Fig. 2b shows that seismic events occurred immediately after the peak of precipitation in 2007 and 2012, while almost no earthquakes were recorded in 2008 and 2009. The total number of seismic events in 2010 is significantly lower than in 2007 and 2011, but still noticeable. Fig. 2c shows the comparison of cumulative rainfall per year and precipitation per month. We note that the highest cumulative rainfall of 900\u20131000 mm occurs in 2007, 2010 and 2011. However, while accumulated rainfall in 2010 is comparable to 2011, monsoon precipitation extends over a significantly longer time span until December. This contrasts with only 450\u2013600 mm accumulation in 2008, 2009 and 2012. This circumstantial evidence suggests that a large number of earthquakes correlate with intensive and high accumulation of rainfall.\nThe decay in seismic activity can last over one year during dry years such as 2008 or 2013. Magnitudes of these later events are in the range of M\n\n\nw\n\n=\n1\n to M\n\n\nw\n\n=\n2\n. Events in 2007 indicate swarm like behavior, similar to 2010 and 2011. Earthquake swarms are usually considered as sequences of numerous, comparably small events, in a local area without an obvious mainshock, and with shallow focal depths and magnitudes between M\n\n\nw\n\n=\n1\n and M\n\n\nw\n\n=\n4\n. Swarm activities are thought to result from very heterogeneous stress fields and\/or pore pressure changes (Miller et al., 2004; Miller, 2015; Duverger et al., 2015; Heinze et al., 2017). Focusing on the cluster of earthquakes around the Talala region within a well-constrained region of 15\u00d720 km (Fig. 1b), the observed seismicity is categorized into separate earthquake swarms by their time windows of occurrence: Swarm 1 lasting from January 2007 to December 2009, Swarm 2 from January 2010 to December 2010, and Swarm 3 from January 2011 to December 2012. Since swarm 2 consists of very few events, we focus only on swarm periods 1 and 3. While the time windows for categorizing these swarms are comparably large, the actual time period of high seismic activity within each time span is around 30\u201360 days (Fig. 2b).\nAs earthquakes with larger magnitude can be considered as the breaking of a hydraulic seal, those act as a new point source for pressure diffusion, from which movement can occur either upwards towards the earth surface or downwards towards greater depths (Miller et al., 2004). Considering the magnitude range during the previously defined swarms, earthquakes with magnitude M\n\n\nw\n\n>\n3\n were chosen as a reference point to calculate the distance of consecutive events relative to this reference. The radial distance of subsequent events from a reference earthquake over time (upwards and downwards motion) is used to calculate the diffusion coefficient, assuming a locally homogeneous material. Further, assuming that the region encompassing the reference earthquake and its subsequent events is homogeneous and isotropic, the evolution of the fluid pore pressure P over time t is described by the linear diffusion equation.\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u2202\nP\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\nD\n\n\n\n\u2207\n\u2192\n\n\n2\n\nP\n,\n\n\nwhere D is the hydraulic diffusivity (Parotidis et al., 2005). This diffusivity is related to the permeability k of the rock:\n\n(2)\n\nD\n=\n\nN k\n\u03b7\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the dynamic pore fluid viscosity and N is a poroelastic modulus related to porosity, to the bulk modulus of the fluid and to the elastic moduli of the rock (Shapiro et al., 1997):\n\n(3)\n\nN\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\nK\nf\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b1\n\nK\ng\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere K\n\nf,d,g\n are the Bulk moduli of fluid, dry frame and grain material, \u03c6 the porosity and evaluating \u03b1 to be 0.3.\nFor an arbitrary event at distance r\n0 from the point source occurring at time t\n0\n>0, the relaxation time of the pore pressure perturbation is equal to \n\nr\n0\n\n\n\n\nt\n0\n\n\/\n(\n4\n\u03c0\nD\n)\n\n\n. Assuming that the event occurs prior to the relaxation, one can obtain the inequality:\n\n(4)\n\n\nt\n0\n\n<\n\nr\n0\n\n\n\n\nt\n0\n\n\/\n(\n4\n\u03c0\nD\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nfrom which the hydraulic diffusivity can be constrained to:\n\n(5)\n\nD\n<\n\n\n\nr\n0\n2\n\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\nt\n0\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nThese equations are reformulated to calculate the radial distance from the point source (Shapiro et al., 1997):\n\n(6)\n\nr\n=\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\nD t\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhich is the distance of the pressure front to the fluid source r for a time t shown as a parabola in an r-t plot. This is then used to estimate the diffusion coefficient, and subsequently the permeability according to Eqs. (2) and (3). Fig. 3\n shows earthquakes of the first and third swarm period, for three different reference (source) points, and are evaluated following Eq. (6). The diffusion coefficient is estimated for upward (blue line) and downward (red line) propagation of the swarms subsets. The average diffusion coefficients obtained for swarms 1 and 3 is about 6 m2\/s. The permeability is determined based on the obtained diffusivity, with the Eq. (2, 3) and Table 1\n (Schoen, 2015; Shapiro et al., 1997). The parameters in Table 1 are taken from literature for the identified rock types (Schoen, 2015; Shapiro et al., 1997). The permeability of the seismogenic region is about 2.58\u00b710\u221212 m2, which is a very reasonable permeability for fractured rocks.\n\n\n4\nMethods\n\n4.1\nTime domain electromagnetics (TDEM)\nThe TDEM method is based on an electric current injected in a transmitter loop to induce a magnetic field, called the primary magnetic field. By turning off this electric current in the transmitter, the induced electromotive force generates eddy currents, which consequently produce a secondary magnetic field whose propagation depends on the conductivity distribution in the subsurface (Dentith and Mudge, 2014). In a receiver loop, the secondary magnetic field can be measured and the surface conductivity distribution with depth can be derived through inversion techniques. A larger transmitter loop allows the detection of deeper targets because the strength of the secondary field decreases with depth. The strongest secondary magnetic field occurs when the primary field is perpendicular to the plane of the conductive receiver body. Therefore, the transmitter is relocated depending on the observed response. In reality, electric conductors in the subsurface are mostly heterogeneous due to a natural variability of minerals, texture and porosity that influence the electric current, so that the eddy currents tend to diverge, merge and re-orientate with time. The electric bulk resistivity of porous rocks is independent of their mineral composition but depends on porosity, fracturing, and water saturation. We conducted a total of 14 TDEM measurements at different locations. The loop size at each profile was 50x50m and data was collected at different sampling frequencies starting from 64kHz to 32Hz. The first eight measurements are aligned along the 12 km long profile I with a W-E orientation, starting from the village Umrala in the west to the town Dhramanva in the east. Profile II consists of six measurements, along an 11 km profile parallel to profile I, starting in the west near the town Dharaput, and extending to the town Bhojde in the east (Fig. 4\n). The profiles were oriented vertical to the assumed fault orientation to locate and characterize the fault using TDEM analysis, and to identify hydraulic conductive zones.\nWe employed the ZondTEM1d software to process TDEM data. The software interprets one-dimensional multi-station Transient Electro Magnetic (TEM) measurements. More information on the data processing is available in the supplementary file. The decay curves of each profile are converted to an apparent electric resistivity of the subsurface. The electromagnetic skin depth can be calculated for the electric conductivity \u03c3, the magnetic permeability \u03bc\n0 and the frequency \u03c9 as \n\u03b4\n=\n\n\n2\n\/\n(\n\u03c3\n\u03c9\n\n\u03bc\n0\n\n)\n\n\n. The skin depth depicts the depth in which the EM field is reduced to 1\/e compared to the surface. It is considered a measure for the depth of investigation of an EM method (Vozoff, 1972). For the 1D profiles of this work, the skin depth was calculated between 76 and 250 m. The iterative inversion process was terminated once the set maximum number of iterations or the desired root-mean-square (RMS) value was reached. The RMS is a measure for the discrepancy between model and measured data. The inversion process was terminated when there was no sufficient improvement between three sequential iterations. This was the most common criteria to end the inversion process in our study. Still, the achieved RMS values were in the range of 1\u20134. The closer RMS to 1, the smaller the divergence between model and true resistivity distribution. Figs. 5\n and 6\n show the subsurface resistivity model, alternated through iterations to achieve the best agreement between the observed data and the synthetic model.\n\n\n4.2\nMagnetotellurics (MT)\nThe magnetotelluric method is a passive electromagnetic geophysical exploration technique that uses naturally occurring geomagnetic variations as a source (Chave and Jones, 2012) and aims to characterize deep subsurface electric structures. One of the source fields of MT signals is the solar wind. The sun emits streams of ions which travel through space and disturb the earth's ambient magnetic field to produce low-frequency electromagnetic waves that penetrate the earth. Since signal sources vary in strength with periods of hours, days and weeks, measuring MT for greater depth requires long recording times in order to get sufficient low-frequency signals to ensure high-quality data (Dentith and Mudge, 2014). The electric properties of the underlying material can be determined from the relationship between the components of the measured electric and magnetic field variations (Chave and Jones, 2012). An MT survey was conducted across the identified conductive zone of TDEM results (Fig. 4). Using the digital acquisition system ADU-07 by Metronix (Germany), 9 stations were set up for periods of 24 hours. The electric field was measured at each site by placing electrodes at the ends of 100 meter long electric dipoles oriented in the local magnetic North-South and East-West directions. The 100 m electrode spacing was selected to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio for the voltage difference measured between electrodes. Pb-PbCl2 was chosen as electrode material as these electrodes are non-polarizing and to minimize noise due to spurious electrochemical potentials and thermal drift (Petiau and Dupis, 1980).\nWe used the program MAPROS (provided by Metronix) to process the data. The recorded voltage values were converted into electric and magnetic field time series that were transformed to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and stacked at prescribed frequencies. We removed significant outliers and large uncertainties in repeated measurements with noisy data (e.g. due to vehicles and\/or wild animals, including tigers). The program ZONDMT2D processes the data to a two-dimensional non-linear inversion (Kaminsky, 2016). The whole process was similar to the inversion process described above for the TDEM method. The program reads observed impedance, apparent resistivity, and phase data that were all output from the MAPROS software package referenced above. A starting model was generated and altered within the inversion process to achieve the best possible underground resistivity model matching the obtained data. A mesh was constructed with a dense grid. More information on data processing is available in the supplementary file. The final inversion result matches the measured data with an RMS value of 1.44. An RMS of 1.44 is close enough to 1 to accept the model as a very good approximation of the resistivity distribution in the subsurface of the study area. Fig. 7\n shows a very good agreement in the observed and calculated sounding curve of station 7 as an example. The remaining sounding curves can be found in the supplementary file.\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nTime domain electromagnetics (TDEM)\n\nFig. 8\n shows the 1D inversion results of both profiles interpolated and combined to a 2D cross-section of the electric resistivity of the subsurface. Both profiles can be related to a geological model with two horizontal layers. The upper layer has a low electric resistivity with roughly 100 \u03a9m, and the lower layer has much higher electric resistivity of 800 to 4000 \u03a9m. The thickness of the upper layer is approximately 20 to 40 m in profile I and 10 to 20 m in profile II. The upper layer may be attributed to the Tertiary sedimentary rock on top of the highly resistive Deccan Traps (Surya Prakasa Rao and Tewari, 2005). These two horizontal layers are interrupted by vertical structures of low electric resistivity (approximately 200 \u03a9m). For the interpretation of those structures, it is helpful to consider surface structures. There are two water reservoirs (Hiran I and II) in the study area associated to the river Hiran and a lake close to the first TDEM profile, called Dadhichi lake (Fig. 4). The Dadhichi lake drains towards northeast and its rivers split crossing station 2 leaving the area around station 3 unaffected. From one water reservoir, when the dam is opened, the water flows around station 7. This might explain the much higher sedimentary rock layer at those stations due to erosion and deposition through the rivers. It also characterizes those areas as weak zones in which the river could easily cut through. Those deep reaching, highly conductive structures likely delineate a fault zone with a high fracture density and probably a high water content within the otherwise electrically highly resistive Deccan Traps. Profile II is located south of the reservoir and therefore not in flow direction, which might also explain the generally thinner sedimentary layer on top. The analysis revealed an electrically conductive zone at station 10 and a little less conductive area at station 13 within a highly resistive surrounding (Fig. 4). In comparison to profile I, the resistivity around stations 10 and 13 is slightly higher (around 200 - 500 \u03a9m) than at stations 2 and 4 (around 100 \u03a9m) but all four stations can be connected to almost parallel lines of the conductive zone. Volcanic and metamorphic rocks are characterized by a high electric resistivity varying between 500 - 10000 \u03a9m. However, in a porous rock or soil, the highest contribution to electric resistivity is often given by porosity and the pore filling. Pore water (bound and free) has a very low electric resistivity in comparison to the matrix of most rocks. The observed low hydraulic resistivity in the volcanic rock can be explained by pore water filling, possibly influencing local stress and pore pressure distribution. The main purpose of the conducted TDEM survey was identification and location of exceptional underground structures. Further characterization of this identified structure required a Magnetorelluric (MT) survey within the indicated conductive zones, as MT provides better resistivity constraints at depth and a greater penetration depth in general.\n\n\n5.2\nMagnetotellurics (MT)\n\nFig. 9\n shows the 2D MT inversion result, representing the resistivity distribution in the subsurface along the 21 km long profile from NW to SE. Station 1 in the NW, covering the profile length between 0\u20133 km, shows an increase in resistivity with depth, as well as the last station (14) in the SE, covering the profile length between 19\u201321 km. However, this could also be caused by boundary effects during the inversion. ZondMT2D does not allow construction of a mesh larger than the covered area by the MT stations to minimize these boundary effects. The most prominent part in the inversion results is a U-shaped structure with a comparably high electric resistivity of 1600 to 1800 \u03a9m at a profile length between 6 and 17 km, at a depth between 5 and 25 km. The structure is covered by stations 3 to 7. To the left and right of this structure, roughly matching the positions of stations 2 and 8, there appears a relatively homogeneous distribution with a resistivity of approximately 300 \u03a9m. Due to the significantly larger electro-magnetic skin depth of the MT method, the method is rather insensitive to near surface structures seen in the TDEM results.\nFocusing on the geological trend between 5 km and 17 km along the profile, the following formations can be interpreted: The first 3 km depth represent the Deccan volcanic traps, consisting of basalt, denoted by high electric resistivity (Surya Prakasa Rao and Tewari, 2005). This is followed by the second layer of Mesozoic sediments with a thickness of approximately 5 km. This area is of lower electric resistivity and coincides with the existence of limestone and similar carbonate sedimentary rocks (Chandrasekhar et al., 2002). We detect structures with a significant electrical resistivity between 5 km and 25 km depth. The structure itself has a higher electric resistivity than the surrounding and can be interpreted as igneous rock, which is known for its high electric resistivity. Since Talala is a volcanic area and since it is totally covered by Deccan Traps, it is very reasonable to assume the existence of volcanic structures beneath the traps. Sheth et al. (2012) did some investigations including petrogenesis and evaluated different volcanic rocks in their composition. He created a model for the crustal substructure of a typical continental flood basalt province with rhyolitic magmas such as the Deccan Traps at an advanced stage of province development. The depth of the estimated igneous rocks by the model of Sheth et al. (2012) matches the depth of the structure identified in the MT profile. Lower resistivity surrounds this bent structure. This lithological cover is known as the Proterozoic basement and consists of granite and similar intrusive igneous rocks. The mix of different volcanic rocks and sedimentary basins can explain this lower resistivity. As indicated in Fig. 9, the Girnar fault is a substantial part of the observed structure, also possibly responsible for its distorted shape. Based on the symmetry of the structure, another fault in the SE dipping NW might be expected but so far, there has been no field evidence for such a fault.\n\n\n\n6\nNumerical modeling\nA numerical hydro-mechanical model is used to examine the relationship between observed earthquakes and monsoon rainfall. TDEM and MT surveys of this work revealed a previously unknown underground structure that might facilitate earthquake generation. A fluid pressure evolution model can help to verify if the properties of the geological structure would trigger rock failure under the presence of monsoon rainfall. Variations of pore pressure P in an inhomogeneous medium (but isotropic in each section) is described by the diffusion equation:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\u2202\nP\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n1\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c6\n\u03b2\n\n\n\u2207\n\nk\n\u03b7\n\n\u2207\nP\n,\n\n\nwith time t, fluid density \u03c1, porosity \u03c6, and \u03b2 is the lumped compressibility of rock and fluid (Segall et al., 1995). We used MATLAB to solve Equation (7) for pore pressure diffusion. The model setup is created based on the TDEM and MT inversion results. The first layer (A) represents the Deccan Traps, consisting of basalt, and known for high hydraulic conductivity and an intermediate porosity (Kumar et al., 2011) (Fig. 10\n). The second layer (B) consists of Mesozoic sediments of limestone and similar carbonate sedimentary rocks, associated with a comparably high porosity, but with significantly less hydraulic conductivity than fractured Deccan Traps. The third layer (C), the Proterozoic basement, consists of a mixture of intrusive igneous rocks and sediments (Chandrasekhar et al., 2002) associated with an intermediate porosity and an overall low hydraulic conductivity attributed to its igneous content. The U-Structure (D) within the third layer is defined as fractured crystalline rock. Hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the igneous crystalline rock in domain D is assumed to be based mainly on fractures (Surya Prakasa Rao and Tewari, 2005). The permeability value for domain D has been set accordingly to the previously presented analysis of the seismic swarms (Table 2\n and Schoen, 2015). However, it is important to note, that there is no further evidence interpreting the identified U-Structure (D) as fractured crystalline rock besides the geological model of Sheth et al. (2012). The presented geological model (Fig. 10) is purely based on the results of the geophysical investigation presented above and most likely an oversimplification of the true geological setting, but sufficient to study the possible relation with monsoon triggered seismicity. The fluid compressibility is set to 4.3\u00d710\u221210 1\/Pa and the effective compressibility of the matrix to 1.4\u00d710\u221210 1\/Pa. Gravity is considered with gravitational acceleration g\n=9.81 m\/s2 and a fluid density of 980 kg\/m3. The increase of water level by 20 m during monsoon period (Hainzl, 2004) and the elevation difference of Hiran Dam I and the conducted MT Profile of 100 m are represented by a static hydraulic overpressure of 1.2 MPa imposed at the top of the model domain. To reproduce the temporal change in hydraulic pressure at the end of monsoon and the beginning of the dry period, a decline of hydraulic pressure has been implemented after 180 days. Following the reservoir levels presented in Hainzl (2004), an exponential decline of water level with the factor of 0.01 has been implemented as a top boundary condition for the dry period. No flow boundary conditions are imposed to the left and right boundary of the model, and hydrostatic pressure is assumed at the base of the model. Simulation duration is set to 365 days to reflect the monsoon and dry season and thus the influence on pressure variation.\n\nFig. 11\n shows model results of pore pressure diffusion as fluid pressure above hydrostatic throughout the monsoon period followed by the dry session. After 120 days, the pressure evolves from the upper layer to the second layer, and a clear diffusion along the boundary of domain D is observed. The second layer very quickly reaches a water level change of 10\u201320 m. After another 60 days, domain D reaches roughly 1 MPa above hydrostatic pressure. Over the following months (240 days\u2013360 days), the pore pressure in domain D decrease from 0.8 MPa to 0.4 MPa and does not diffuse noticeably into the deepest layer. The simulated temporal change of pore pressure coincides with the temporal evolution of seismic events (Fig. 2b). Roughly 110 days after the start of heavy rainfall, the first earthquakes occur in the study area. The calculated pore pressure values of 1 MPa are at the lower end of pore pressure values sufficient to re-active optimal oriented faults in subdomain D. The dynamics of the pore pressure distribution at depth due to increased water level at the surface matches the spatio-temporal evolution of fluid-triggered seismicity. During the pore pressure evolution, the permeability increases rapidly along the fracture leading to rapid failure of faults. The non-linear behavior of the spatio-temporal evolution seen in the seismic catalog could be explained by the re-activation of faults with various orientations. For example, earthquakes at 8\u201312 km depth occurring later than other earthquakes at greater depth can be explained by a less optimal oriented fault requiring a higher fluid pressures to slip.\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\nWe conducted geophysical surveys to reveal subsurface structures to investigate and understand the mechanisms driving seismicity that apparently correlates with heavy rainfall during the monsoon season. We used our geophysical observations to constrain a numerical model that explores the hypothesis that seismicity in the region is monsoon triggered. TDEM measurements show that the Deccan Traps are intercepted by vertical structures of significantly lower electric resistivity, suggesting fluid pathways at shallow levels. An MT profile across these vertical structures reveals a high resistive, lens-shaped structure in the seismogenic depth range of approximately 10\u201325 km. Based on the work of Sheth et al. (2012) the structure is most likely of volcanic origin. In his model, such shapes represent magma chambers or progressively more evolved liquid compositions, which is also in agreement with the work of Cox (1989). In the specific case shown, the Girnar fault is crossing the structure in the west, dipping south-east. We hypothesize that a similar fault structure is located in the eastern part of the study area, dipping south-west to explain the U-shape of the structure. Seismic activity measured between 2007 and 2012 evidently correlates with the lens-shaped structure (Fig. 12\n), and the catalog of well-located seismic events supports the existence of a tapered structure with increasing depth identified in the MT survey. Water reservoirs and large lakes surrounding the MT profile locations likely influence the hydrogeological dynamics following monsoon rainfall events. The electrically conductive areas identified appear to correlate with the drainage systems of these reservoirs, which can significantly influence the effective normal stress conditions at depth. We analytically estimate the hydraulic diffusivity of the seismogenic area by the migration and assuming fluid-pressure driven seismic sequences. The calculated diffusivity values indicate a highly permeable host rock for the lens-shaped structure, which dominates the flow. The hydraulic properties of the other lithological layers do not significantly influence the flow because pore pressure diffusion is dominated by the highly hydraulically conductive zones. While the works of Sheth et al. (2012) and Cox (1989) suggest an interpretation of the U-shaped structure as an igneous rock intrusion, such an interpretation cannot be verified through the geophysical investigations presented in this work. From the seismic analysis, only hydraulic properties can be derived which indicate fractures as dominant flow paths. However, for the outcome of this work, only shape, location and hydraulic properties of the U-shaped structure are of relevance.\nNumerical simulation results show the effect of high water level at the surface on the pore pressure evolution at depth. The pore pressure increases by almost 0.8 MPa within 120 days at 15 km depth within the lens-shaped structure. The simulation results explain the spatio-temporal evolution of the observed earthquakes, as over time the earthquakes are expanding mainly from shallower to deeper levels. By the end of the monsoon period, the decrease of water level is represented by an exponential decrease of hydraulic pressure, as imposed at the top of the model domain. This scenario reflects a hydrostatic (e.g. dry or partly saturated) subsurface after the monsoon season and explains the high resistivity of MT measurements conducted during dry season. In this case, a well-connected fracture network at depth would channel the rain along the main fractures, similar to filling a Karst network after heavy rainfall, and trigger the subsequently induced seismicity (Miller, 2008; D\u2019Agostino et al., 2018; Montgomery-Brown et al., 2019). Due to its high hydraulic conductivity, the lens-shaped structure experiences high pore pressures, which barely diffuse into the surrounding and therefore constrains the spread of the earthquakes. Due to its very small porosity, the water-filled pores have barely any influence on the electric signature as the high electric resistivity of the crystalline rock dominates, especially as the measurement was conducted during the dry season. Further research is required to determine the origin of the bent structure and to study the local stress conditions in a detailed manner to help assess the future seismic hazard of the region. Combining these finding with statistical correlation between precipitation and earthquakes in the Talala region, it is very clear that rainfall is the most prominent trigger for earthquakes in the region. Despite the variable amount and duration of the monsoon in NW India, there are further effects such as dry periods within the year of variable intensity which leads to dehydration of the soil and low water levels in the water reservoirs. All of those might be responsible for lack of seismic activities as in years 2009 and 2010.\n\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn this work, we demonstrate a pore pressure diffusion at depth induced by monsoon rainfall likely acts as a trigger for seismic activity in the Talala region. Geophysical measurements (TDEM and MT) reveal a lens-shaped or curved structure coinciding with the hypocentres of the seismic events and which agrees with existing measurements of the gravitational anomaly of the region. The hydraulic pore pressure diffusion in the lens-shaped structure reveals a host rock with comparably high hydraulic permeability. The numerical modeling results indicate a high pore pressure evolution within the bent structure. Combining these new findings with previous knowledge such as statistically evident temporal coincidence of earthquakes, precipitation and the spatio-temporal evolution of the seismic activity, fluid is a very likely triggering mechanism for the observed seismicity in the study area. The revealed structure explains the localization of the earthquakes and the comparably quick pore pressure diffusion with depth.\n\n","146":"","147":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe injection of CO2 into a reservoir causes direct changes in both the pore fluid pressure and in situ temperature due to the injected volume and temperature of CO2. The pore-pressure changes occur mainly within the permeable reservoir. With time, both pressure and temperature changes can also dissipate into the low-permeable surrounding formations such as the caprock and underburden. The net change in pore-pressure due to injection (causing expansion) and thermal stresses from the cooling (causing contraction), deforms the reservoir and the surrounding formations. This deformation induces stress changes in magnitude and direction that are transferred far beyond the CO2 plume and temperature footprint (Vilarrasa et al., 2013).\nIn most CO2 storage projects, these stress changes are not large enough to create new fractures within the sealing caprock and surrounding intact rocks but they might be sufficient to reactivate pre-existing geological discontinuities and weaknesses (e.g., faults and associated fractures). These pre-existing structures, if penetrating a caprock, may be a possible leakage path for CO2 and their identification is therefore crucial for risk assessment of storage integrity.\nMonitoring has accompanied sequestration projects, allowing also for a better understanding of the subsurface (e.g., Furre et al., 2017; Verdon et al., 2010). Monitoring methodologies include: (i) monitoring of pressure and temperature at wells; (ii) active conventional geophysical methods (e.g., seismic reflection and gravimetric measurements) aimed to both ensure storage and injection feasibility and to investigate changes in the subsurface during and post injection; (iii) and microseismic monitoring to understand pre-injection background seismicity and induced or triggered seismicity during and post injection. These methodologies allow the evaluation of the geomechanical response of reservoir and surrounding regions.\nConventional active seismic methods are not able to detect faults with small vertical displacement or small discontinuities, due to resolution limits generally encountered in seismic imaging methods at large depths. The resolution limit is typically less than 10m. Processing of 3D seismic reflection volumes for geometrical attributes, such as curvature, can sometimes illuminate subtle features that are related to discontinuities in the subsurface. For instance, at the In Salah CO2 storage site at Krechba (Algeria), where injection pressures exceeded fracture pressure (Goertz-Allmann et al., 2014), a double-lobed displacement pattern indicating up to 20-mm ground surface uplift was measured using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), but no structure was resolved through seismic imaging methods. The post-injection 3D seismic interpretation revealed a subtle \u201cpush-down structure\u201d associated with linear features at depth below the double-lobed pattern, which was interpreted as a low-velocity zone due to the presence of CO2. The calculation of ant-tracking attributes to extract trends from the data produced linear features that correlate well both with the low velocity zone and the displacement at the surface, and thus, were interpreted to represent an up to 3.5km long sub-vertical fracture or damage zone (Zhang et al., 2015).\nAn increase in pore pressure reduces the effective stresses, shifting the stress state, often illustrated in a Mohr diagram, closer to or beyond the failure envelope of fractures and faults typically defined by the Coulomb criterion and friction coefficient, resulting in failure by shear slip or dilation (e.g., Sibson, 1985; Healy et al., 1968). The seismic energy released during such slip can be recorded by seismometers and geophones. The minimum moment magnitude Mw that may be detected by geophones is as low as \u22124 corresponding to an estimated slip of ca. 0.01mm on a structure of ca. 3cm radius (e.g., Fig. 2 in Zoback and Gorelick, 2012). Most commonly, the range of microseismic events is considered from Mw \u22123 to 0. To detect and locate small magnitude events, seismic instruments should be placed at short distances around the injector, within boreholes less than several hundred-meter distances and if at the surface within networks or arrays focusing on up to 1.5 times the injection depth.\nThe focus area of this paper is the Decatur (IL, USA) carbon capture and storage site (CCS), where CO2 has been injected during two injection phases (Ph1 and Ph2) near the base of the Lower Mt. Simon Sandstone saline reservoir as part of two CCS projects (Finley, 2014; Williams-Stroud et al., 2020). During the first injection phase (Ph1), as part of the Illinois Basin \u2013 Decatur Project (IBDP), 1million tonnes of CO2 have been injected over a period of 3 years (November 2011\u2013November 2014) into well CCS1 (well location in Fig. 1\na). The second injection phase (Ph2), as part of the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Sequestration (IL-ICCS), is ongoing since April 2017 and has permitted injection capacity of a little over 1million tonnes\/year of CO2 in well CCS2, located about 1km northeast of CCS1 (well location in Fig. 1a; Fig. 2\n). As of June 2021, more than 2.5million tonnes of CO2 have been injected in CCS2.\nThe two injection wells (CCS1 and CCS2) are placed about 1km apart from each other (Fig. 1a) and both wells target the Lower Mt. Simon Sandstone for injection. The injection is into a different high-permeability zone in each well, both relatively near to the top of basement. At CCS1, injection occurred at two perforation depths where most CO2 was injected in the lowermost perforation interval between 1937\u20131945m below sea level (BSL) (Bauer et al., 2016). At CCS2, injection occurred at a slightly shallower depth (46m shallower than CCS1) in four perforation zones.\nIn addition, two verification wells, VW1 and VW2, located approx. 300m north of CCS1 and 800m northwest of CCS2 injection wells were used to evaluate performance by monitoring in situ pressure, temperature, and pore fluid composition. Whole core and sidewall cores were retrieved from all boreholes along with downhole petrophysical logging to evaluate the hydraulic, mechanical and in situ stress directions and properties of the caprock, reservoir, and basement (Freiburg et al., 2020; Bauer et al., 2016; Morrow et al., 2017). Additionally, Formation MicroImager (FMI) logging was run in all four boreholes to identify sedimentological and structural features, in situ stress direction indicators and dominant fracture sets and their characteristics, which we compare to microseismic event cluster characteristics in Section\u00a04. Core samples of the basement extracted from the four wells were also used for microstructural analysis and dating (Freiburg et al., 2020).\nSince the start of injection in 2011, microseismic events have been recorded by borehole geophones and, from June 2013 onwards, by additional USGS and ISGS surface sensors. These surface sensors are only used for focal mechanisms computation and are shown in Fig. 1 in Langet et al. (2020). The geophysical monitoring wells GM1 and GM2, together with PS3 and VW2 are depicted in Fig. 1b. 4293 of the microseismic events detected by these downhole sensors were relocated by Dando et al. (2021) using a modified double difference (DD) relative relocation procedure. The DD-relocations better constrain the events within their respective clusters and show improvements towards clearer, more distinct and tighter spatial event clusters (Fig. 9 in Dando et al., 2021). Most microseismicity occurred during Ph1 (Fig. 2) with a strong decrease in event activity after permanent shut-in and no significant increase of event activity during Ph2. Fine-grained mudstone layers intercepted by the wells at various depths were not correlatable between wells, and were interpreted to represent discontinuous low-permeability lenses occurring within the Lower Mt. Simon Sandstone. These mudstone layers act as baffles that influence fluid-flow and appear to restrict vertical flow, forcing fluid migration to be primarily horizontal (Williams-Stroud et al., 2020). This behavior was observed when comparing the pressure changes in the verification wells, as indicated by the response of pressure gauges at different depths (Greenberg, 2020). The CCS1 injection was conducted in the lowermost part of the Mt. Simon Sandstone reservoir below a lower permeability zone in the middle of the lower Mt. Simon, whereas CCS2 is injecting above this zone. Additionally, Williams-Stroud et al. (2020) attribute the difference in the activity level of the induced seismicity to the difference in the injection interval zones.\nMost events are located within the upper 250m of Precambrian basement with significantly fewer events above the basement and in the Lower Mt. Simon reservoir. For selected clusters, events could be separated in defined sub-clusters using waveform cross-correlation and migration patterns were identified (Goertz-Allmann et al., 2017). Furthermore, Goertz-Allmann et al. (2017) and Goertz-Allmann et al. (2021) analyzed spatial variations of source parameters such as stress drop and Gutenberg's b-value for selected event clusters. These variations may indicate differences in the medium or the fault properties and changes in pore pressure. Overall, Goertz-Allmann et al. (2021) concluded that events with lower b-values are deeper and further away from the cluster nucleation.\nIn addition to the updated event catalogue, the 3D seismic reflection cube was reprocessed (survey area corresponds to the extend of the basement map in Fig. 1) showing improved seismic resolution and allowing the identification of faults ranging from 100 to 1200m in length. Generally, the positions of the faults do not directly correlate with the location of microseismic events (Fig. 1, Williams-Stroud et al., 2020). The faults can be divided into three main sets based on their orientation: (i) N-S striking faults that are more frequent in the east and southeast of the seismic survey; (ii) two WNW-ESE striking faults, to the south of cluster D and (iii) ENE-WSW to E-W across the basement low, between clusters C and G (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a few NE-SW faults have been mapped.\nThe objective of this paper is to investigate microseismic activity at Decatur and show (i) how bursts can help to identify structural weaknesses and complement cluster analysis defining smaller-scale fractures as well as (ii) how clusters and bursts can help to constrain local variations in the stress state. We will demonstrate how the spatial analysis of accurate event locations (employing the DD-catalogue) complements the interpretation of reflection seismic imaging in structural analysis, particularly when investigating subsurface discontinuities below the imaging resolution. Given that seismicity occurs on pre-existing fractures susceptible to slip, we interpret their orientation as extracted from the event locations with respect to the stress field by using slip tendency methods. Furthermore, source parameter analysis (e.g., source mechanisms determined by Langet et al., 2020 and b-value analysis by Goertz-Allmann et al., 2021) provides additional information.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section\u00a02, we provide an overview of the regional geological and reservoir settings at the Decatur site. Particular focus is given to the knowledge of pre-existing fractures at hypocentral depths and to the regional stress state in terms of both orientation and magnitude. In Section\u00a03, we describe the seismicity and how spatial and temporal clusters (or bursts) have been extracted from the updated microseismicity catalogue. In Section\u00a04, we illustrate specific features of selected spatial clusters and bursts in relation to the known stress state. In Section\u00a05, we summarize the major findings and finally, in Section\u00a06 we have concluding remarks.\n\n\n2\nRegional and reservoir geological settings\nThe Illinois Basin is a large intracratonic basin (approx. 155,000km2, Fig. 3\n) and constitutes a depression slightly elongated in NW-SE direction. It extends through central and southern Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky and is bounded by arches and domes (Yang et al., 2017). Precambrian basement is part of the Eastern Granite-Rhyolite province and a Late Precambrian to Early Cambrian rifting event during breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia is believed to have led to its formation (Freiburg et al., 2020). The basin thickens southwards and is filled with up to approx. 7km of Paleozoic (Early or Middle Cambrian to Early Permian) sedimentary rocks as consequence of subsidence pulses (Kolata and Nelson, 1990). The southern end of the basin is known to display natural seismicity (Tuttle et al., 2002) and to be dominated by Proterozoic rift structures including the Reelfoot Rift-Rough Creek Graben systems that might, to some extent, also control present-day seismicity as suggested by McBride et al. (2007). Another large-scale but low relief structure is the Sandwich Fault zone, located west of the termination of the Kankakee Arch, which separates the Illinois Basin from the Michigan Basin to the northeast (Yang et al., 2017). The remaining part of the Illinois Basin, although not dominated by large-scale structures, did not behave as a rigid block during geological history. This is documented by the presence of mainly N- to NNW-trending folds of the La Salle Anticline and its westernmost frontal culmination, the Charleston monocline, which were active for most of the Paleozoic (McBride, 1997) and located in eastern Illinois. Additional folds include the roughly ENE-striking Peoria Folds, north-northwest of Springfield (Fig. 3). The majority of the folds in the Illinois basin are drag-folds attributed to underlying faults within the basement, such as the La Salle fold which is assumed to be similarly underlain at depth by a reverse intra-basement fault with the overlying Paloezoic strata accommodating its displacement, though when drilled, no evidence of a fault was found (McBride, 1997).\nThe storage target of both the IBDP and IL-ICCS is the Cambrian Mt. Simon Sandstone, a regionally extensive formation that is divided into Lower, Middle, and Upper Mt. Simon Sandstone (Freiburg et al., 2014). The Mt. Simon Sandstone reaches a maximum thickness of approx. 790m in northeastern and east-central Illinois (Leetaru and McBride, 2009). The Lower Mt. Simon Sandstone has been further divided into two units (A and B) based on major depositional facies (Freiburg et al., 2014). The best reservoir quality rocks are in the Lower Mt. Simon Sandstone (average porosity of 22% and 28% as well as permeability of 200mD and 250mD at CCS1 and CCS2, respectively), while the Middle Mt. Simon Sandstone has poor reservoir properties, mainly due to diagenetic quartz cementation (Leetaru and Freiburg, 2014). The Mt. Simon Sandstone is overlain by the Eau Claire Formation, which is the primary seal (approx. 150m thick). The Argenta formation, formerly known as pre-Mt. Simon, underlies the Mt. Simon and overlies unconformably the igneous Precambrian Basement. This unconformity is also known as the sub-Sauk or Great Unconformity, and corresponds to an approx. 900Ma hiatus (Leetaru and Freiburg, 2014). The Argenta formation is characterized by significantly lower porosity and permeability compared to the reservoir (Freiburg et al., 2014). The Precambrian basement is compositionally heterogeneous and structurally complex, mainly made of rhyolite, although gabbro, granite, and volcaniclastic breccia have been penetrated by the CCS1, CCS2 and VW1 and VW2 wells (Freiburg et al., 2020). Furthermore, an approx. 5-m thick trachyte dyke intruding the volcanoclastic breccia has been observed at VW1 (Freiburg et al., 2020).\nWithin the area covered by the reprocessed active seismic data, the basement at the Decatur site is located between 1903 and 2054m BSL (Fig. 1) and its topography is characterized by a distinct variation in elevation: topographic highs occur in the western part of the survey area and lows in the eastern part. This elevation change east of VW2 occurs along a NNW-SSE trend. The high relief area to the west is divided by an irregular ENE-WSW trending basement low ca. 800m north of CCS1. Freiburg et al. (2020) interpreted this topographic low acting as lithological compartmentalization boundary for the basement on the basis of wells located north and south of the topographic low that penetrate the uppermost basement rocks.\nThe Argenta formation shows thicknesses of up to 87m. Close to the basement high north of VW1, the thickness is less than 10m and the Argenta might be absent (Fig. 1). Freiburg et al. (2014) described the basal 30cm of the Argenta as completely bleached with traces of vertical fractures showing slight diagenetic alteration, which suggests past fluid migration. Sidewall cores and FMI logs from VW1 and VW2 indicate that the Precambrian basement is highly fractured. Fractures are commonly mineralized with calcite cement and in places, likewise show diagenetic alteration, which suggests past fluid migration (Freiburg et al., 2014; Will et al., 2014).\nTo ensure CCS storage feasibility, 2D seismic profiles were initially acquired. In 2010, 3D seismic surveys were conducted targeting the area that would likely be affected by the CO2 plume. In 2011, this survey was extended to provide coverage to the north of the site and later, in 2015, the entire survey was repeated to monitor reservoir response to the CO2 plume (Bauer et al., 2019). Challenges in the acquisition and processing of the 3D seismic data were primarily the high levels of anthropogenic noise, since the site is located within an industrial area, nevertheless suitable results for structural interpretation were obtained (Bauer et al., 2019). By integrating petrographic analysis, geophysical logs, and drill cores from the four wells with the first-processed three-dimensional seismic reflection volume, Freiburg et al. (2020) investigated the basement. They analyzed 16m thick depth slices (between 1965m and 2080m BSL) of a 3D semblance attribute cube and interpreted a series of ENE-WSW and NNW-SSE striking discontinuities in the basement (Fig. 8 in Freiburg et al., 2020).\nAlthough faults were not visible in the first processed volume, reprocessing provided a large improvement of resolution that allowed to identify for the first time faults between 100m and 1200m long extending from the cover sequences into the basement (Williams-Stroud et al., 2020). A comparison between the original processed and reprocessed seismic cross-section is shown in Fig. 4 in (Williams-Stroud et al., 2020). Their fault traces at the top of the basement are shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, a new porosity inversion calibrated with petrophysical properties measured at the wells greatly reduced the uncertainty of the horizon picks and more clearly illuminated the contacts between the Argenta formation and the underlying igneous basement. Recent work on the pressure response at CCS1, VW1 and VW2 due to the injection at the CCS2 allowed us to interpret reservoir heterogeneities that influence vertical and horizontal flow.\n\n2.1\nIn situ stress, regional and at the site\nWe collected stress state information from multiple sources for Illinois and the Illinois Basin (e.g., Bauer et al., 2016; Lahann et al., 2017; Cornet, 2014). The stress field orientation with the maximum horizontal stress (\u03c3\n\nH\n) azimuth between 060\u00b0 and 075\u2013080\u00b0 is consistent with the eastern part of the North American plate, although local variations close to major structures have been observed (Bauer et al., 2016; Lahann et al., 2017). There are 6 sites with in situ stress measurements within about 64 to 113km (40 to 70 miles) of the IBDP site that used hydraulic fracturing, overcoring, or strain relaxation (Bauer et al., 2016, Fig. 3a). The average maximum stress direction for the northern 2\/3 of Illinois is 066\u00b0 (rose diagram in Fig. 3a).\nStress gradients were primarily calculated from hydraulic fracture records or extended leak-off tests as well as summation of strata density data for vertical gradients (Lahann et al., 2017). The \u03c3\n\nV\n gradient is estimated to 24.9MPa\/km and 27.1MPa\/km, above and below 2134m depth BGL (below ground level, representing an approximation of the basement depth across the basin; Lahann et al., 2017). The \u03c3\n\nh\n gradient was calculated to range between 24.1MPa\/km and 27.3MPa\/km. The \u03c3\n\nH\n estimate based on a critically stressed fault model yielded values between 40.0MPa\/km and 82.6MPa\/km (Lahann et al., 2017, gray range in Fig. 3b).\nDifferent measuring techniques of in situ stress show that the stress regime at Decatur is strike-slip (\u03c3\n\nH\n\n>\n\u03c3\n\nV\n\n>\n\u03c3\n\nh\n), for most of the lithologies with higher shear strength, including the basement. Certain depth sections of boreholes CCS1, CCS2, VW1 and VW2 show failure stress indicators related to the in situ stress interpreted from Formation MicroImager (FMI) logs. Numerous tensile opening and tensile shear fractures occur in the Argenta and the Upper and Middle Mt. Simon formations and some in the Precambrian. All are produced during drilling in reaction to the in situ stresses. These drilling induced tensile fractures also indicate a strike-slip or nearly strike-slip stress regime. Breakouts are common within the Argenta interval in CCS2 and the Lower Mt. Simon in VW2. Both breakouts and tensile fractures show an average azimuth of 068\u00b0 for the maximum horizontal principal stress (Bauer et al., 2016), with averages between 063\u00b0 and 071\u00b0 for the single dataset and 071\u00b0 for 6 tensile induced fractures in the basement at VW1 (Fig. 5d). Five measurements in the Precambrian basement taken at the FutureGen site, 97km west of IBDP, show the average maximum stress direction at 068\u00b0 and a range of 062\u00b0 to 077\u00b0, which is consistent with what observed at Decatur. Furthermore, a range of stress magnitude gradients have been measured at FutureGen in the basement, yielding values between 28.29MPa\/km and 43.11MPa\/km calculated for the maximum principal \u03c3\n\nH\n and measured between 18.62 to 19.38MPa\/km with an average of 19.17MPa\/km for the \u03c3\n\nh\n (Cornet, 2014, Fig. 3b). Given the large similarity of reservoir and basement rocks at the two sites, the proximity to the sites and the same \u03c3\n\nH\n azimuth, we believed that these measurements are representative of the stress state at the Decatur site. The magnitudes for the maximum principal \u03c3\n\nH\n calculated by Lahann et al. (2017) (using a coefficient of fault frictions as high as 1.0) are about twice as high as what was otherwise calculated using measurements in the Illinois Basin and in the basement at FutureGen, and in particular when comparing with measurements relatively close to the Decatur site (Fig. 3b).\n\n\n\n3\nMicroseismicity at the Decatur site\nMicroseismic events are distributed in distinct spatial clusters over an area of approximately 9km2 around the injection wells (Fig. 1). The maximum measured pore pressure increase at 300m from CCS1 during Ph1 (1.2MPa) resulted in a pore pressure that was far below the formation fracture pressure (Bauer et al., 2016, 31.6\u201334.2MPa at the depth of injection). There is no clear relation between injected volumes and seismicity (e.g., Goertz-Allmann et al., 2017) and no observed relation between distance of recorded events to injection points and time of occurrence. This suggests that the events are most likely induced by small stress field changes, pore-pressure increase or by Coulomb stress transfer, causing reactivation of pre-existing fractures. Such pre-existing structures were interpreted visually based on the semi-linearity in plan-view of a part of the seismic clouds and observed to align with linear texture in a curvature map obtained from the originally-processed active seismic data (e.g., Will et al., 2014). Goertz-Allmann et al. (2017) analyzed event migration patterns along selected clusters and interpreted basement-reservoir connected faults or fractures.\n\nDando et al. (2021) reprocessed the waveform data and relocated 4293 events, constituting a new catalogue (DD-catalogue) covering the period between December 15, 2011 and July 2, 2018. Of these events, 3847 occur during Ph1 injection at CCS1, 325 during the inter-injection phase and 121 since the beginning of the Ph2 injection at the CCS2 well. Although the injection rates average 1.7 times higher within CCS2, based on cumulative CO2 injected by the end of 2020, this rate increase is not accompanied by a corresponding rise in microseismicity. Various short periods of shut-in (temporary hold in injection) occurred during Ph1 and are recognizable in injection rate and downhole pressure (orange and blue curves in Fig. 2, respectively) and these are likewise not accompanied by a decrease or increase in event rates.\nThe DD-catalogue provided event locations, which are more tightly clustered spatially revealing more precise linearized features. Furthermore, particularly during Ph1, seismicity is characterized by sudden increases in the event rate for short time periods. Such increases may be defined as \u201cseismicity bursts\u201d, and are sometimes also referred to as \u201ctemporal event clusters\u201d as opposed to \u201cspatial clusters\u201d (e.g., Vidale and Shearer, 2006). Bursts have been recognized in other geological settings, particularly in relation to pre-eruptive magmatic processes, but also associated to natural and induced seismicity, e.g., during seismic swarms in Iceland (Duboeuf et al., 2021), and at the Weyburn CCS site, Saskatchewan, Canada (Verdon, 2016). Such bursts have also been observed to expand spatially over time, probably caused by pore pressure fluctuations (Vidale and Shearer, 2006).\nOur motivation for analyzing seismicity bursts is that we see an increasing potential to attribute dynamic stress field changes to reservoir-scale features based on the interpretation of bursts. Events that occur relatively close in space and time are most likely triggered by a similar physical mechanism that reveals the fault\/fracture characteristics and strike and allows to infer pore pressure and stress changes. These events may further delineate discrete fractures and smaller-scale discontinuities within the larger spatial clusters. Bursts can highlight a spatio-temporal evolution and other patterns that may allow a better understanding of stress propagation, gradually revealing the causative plane. Information on the causative fault planes is usually obtained from focal mechanisms and additional geological data; however, to achieve reliable and precise focal planes, the sensor network needs to provide sufficient azimuthal coverage with clear onset observations. At Decatur for example, focal mechanisms could therefore only be determined within two specific regions. In the northernmost clusters C, 23 focal mechanisms were computed by Langet et al. (2020) using a combination of both downhole and surface data. Following the same methodology, 16 additional mechanisms are computed for this study for region D and presented in Section\u00a04.\nIn the following section, we introduce the selection process of both clusters and bursts and how they can complement other types of analysis and data in defining geological structures.\n\n3.1\nCriteria for cluster selection\nClustering of seismic events at Decatur occurred during Ph1 and clusters were interpreted to represent discontinuities on the basis of their semi-linearity in plan-view (e.g., Will et al., 2014), but with an increase in number of seismic events, some clusters progressively revealed a different orientation from what was originally hypothesized.\nIn this study, we manually define 18 distinct spatial clusters from the (Dando et al., 2021) catalogue (Fig. 1). For computational reasons, the events were split in seven regions (named A to G) during the relocation procedure, based on their geographical location. It was shown by Dando et al. (2021) that these regions feature different degrees of location uncertainties due to the uneven station distribution (Fig. 1). In the following, we refer to the clusters by these regions and, in the case of more than one cluster occurring in the same region, use an additional number. Some outliers (approx. 6%) are not assigned to any cluster as they constitute sparse events in-between clearly recognized clusters (marked as gray dots in Fig. 1).\nFrom these 18 clusters, we extract a series of statistical and geometrical parameters, which are listed in Table 1\n and described in the following section. These parameters aim to characterize the clusters in terms of shape and location. For each cluster, the principal axes of the best-fitted ellipsoid, computed from the 3D locations of the event cloud, provide information on the seismicity pattern and trend within each cluster. For instance, the shape of the ellipsoid defined by the ratio of its axes can help to recognize if the seismicity delineates a near-prolate ellipsoid (cigar-shaped, one axis is significantly longer than the other two), a near-oblate ellipsoid (disk-shaped, two axes are significantly longer than the third) or a near-spheroid ellipsoid (all axes are of relatively similar length). A measure of these shapes can be defined by the planarity and linearity coefficients, both ranging from 0 to 1. In the following, we define the planarity as Pl\n=1\u22122\u03bb\n3\/(\u03bb\n1\n+\n\u03bb\n2) and the linearity as L\n=1\u2212(\u03bb\n2\n+\n\u03bb\n3)\/2\u03bb\n1, where \u03bb\n1\n\u2264\n\u03bb\n2\n\u2264\n\u03bb\n3 are the eigenvalues representing the length of the ellipsoid semi-axes. These coefficients are also used to define the type of structure as planar (Pl\n>\nL), linear (L\n>\nPl) or cloud (either Pl or L\n<0.7, an arbitrary value chosen during visual inspection). The minor axis of the ellipsoid is normal to the fault plane. Hence, the dip angle coincides with the angle between minor and vertical axis. The fault strike is derived from the dip direction, which is the angle between the minor axis projected at the surface and geographic North. The convention used here is based on the right-hand-rule (RHR). Furthermore, the strike and dip angles of the best fitting plane are only representative of the underlying structure for near-prolate and near-oblate ellipsoids. However, the strike is only well constrained if the major axis of the near-prolate ellipsoid is sub-horizontal, while the dip might be affected by uncertainty.\nIt is worth noting that the shape of the ellipsoid may be quite sensitive to potential outliers, especially if the number of events is small. Thus, we remove all events with locations at distance to the ellipsoid centroid larger than two standard deviations. Finally, we define the event density within each ellipsoid to be the number of events in the ellipsoid per unit volume (No.\/m3). To that end, we considered the volume of the 95% confidence ellipsoid.\n\n\n3.2\nCriteria for burst selection\nBursts can be identified manually or automatically. A manual selection of bursts highlighted that the duration of each burst and the number of events contributing to it is highly variable; therefore, defining an exact criterion to automatically select bursts can be challenging. The method we employ is based only on the event origin times and thus, differing from other existing studies which also include a spatial constraint (e.g., Vidale and Shearer, 2006). Therefore, a burst may include events from more than one cluster (Table 2\n). This choice is dictated by our interest in determining if out-of-cluster events may highlight a migration pattern from one cluster to the next or if seismicity bursts occurring simultaneously at different locations may indicate of similar pressure front conditions.\nThe two largest increases in seismicity rate on February 26 and June 24, 2012 (black arrows in Fig. 2a, close-up view in Fig. 2b) show a different pattern. The first of these two periods of increased seismicity is characterized by well-defined temporally discrete bursts, which renders the extraction of bursts simpler and unequivocal. The second time period shows a more \u201ccloud-like\u201d pattern with less clearly defined bursts.\nConsidering that bursts consist of a number of events occurring within a relatively short period of time, we scan through the event timeline to identify consecutive events that occur within a time range shorter than a predefined threshold value f, which is a measure of frequency of occurrence. The schematic diagram in the inset in Fig. 4\n\na shows an example for a threshold of f\n=1. Events i are represented as black dots occurring at different times t\n\ni\n (t\n1, t\n2, \u2026) and event intervals are defined as \u0394t\n\ni\n\n=\nt\n\ni+m\n\n\u2212\nt\n\ni\n, where m is the number of event intervals (e.g., two events correspond to one event interval, m\n=1, three events, m\n=2, etc.). For m\n=1 the events will represent a burst if the event interval \u0394t\n\ni\n\n\u22641\/f (see blue and green check marks). This procedure was repeated for an increasing number of event intervals m, which can be defined as m\n=No. \u22121, where No. is the number of events. In Fig. 4, the color plot shows log\n10(m\/\u0394t\n\ni\n) for all the events i as a function of a mean interval time (t\n\ni+m\n\n+\nt\n\ni\n)\/2 for m between 10 and 370 (10 and 370 were considered as end members for the number of event intervals in the manually selected bursts).\nBursts are represented in Fig. 4a in red (log\n10(m\/\u0394t\n\ni\n)\u22652). White gaps correspond to time periods where large inter-event times are observed. Fig. 4 illustrates that bursts mainly occur during Ph1 (Fig. 4a) with only one burst occurring after the end of this injection phase, containing only a few events. Note that large inter-event times are only observed after Ph1. Fig. 4b shows the time range in which bursts have been recognized.\nFor a value of m\n=10, the automatically and manually selected bursts were comparable in terms of total number, number of events, and duration. An overview of manual, automatic, and final selection of bursts is reported in Table S1 in the supplementary material. During the automatic selection process, a larger number of bursts could be identified compared to the manual analysis, in part due to the subdivision of manually recognized bursts.\nOnly in one case, two manually identified separate bursts were not correctly split by the automatic process, probably because they were consecutive.\nTherefore, the final selection of 35 bursts analyzed in Section\u00a04 is extracted from both manual and automatic processing (Fig. 1, Figs. S1 and S2 in the supplementary material). Similar to the cluster analysis, strike, dip, and planarity were extracted for the bursts by defining both the event ellipsoid and burst centroid (Table 2).\n\n\n\n4\nSpatial and temporal patterns in event clusters\n\n4.1\nSpatial patterns\nCluster distribution at Decatur is irregular with 8 of 18 clusters (Fig. 5a) occurring in an approximately 1km2 area north of VW1. To the north and west of this region, clusters are separated by larger distances (Fig. 1). To the west, clusters A and B are composed of sparser events, with intermittent denser clustering. The location uncertainty of most relocated events is relatively low (Fig. 1 and Dando et al., 2021). An apparent overall plan-view linearity can be inferred for cluster A but it also has the largest event location uncertainty. For cluster B, a similar overall plan-view linearity is poorly defined, due to the scattered spatial distribution of the events. To the north, cluster C features an event density that is one order of magnitude higher compared to clusters A and B (Table 1). In addition, events exhibit a clear plan-view linearity in E-W direction. The highest event density occurs in cluster D3 with 997 events (equivalent to a density of 330,000events\/km3), followed by cluster G with 903 events (equivalent to a density of 52,500events\/km3) (Table 1). Cluster G spans the largest area (approximately 780m\u00d7250m) and has an overall orientation similar to clusters D1\u2013D5, and D7 (Fig. 5a and b).\nClusters with higher numbers of events and with higher event density may also provide more reliable information on underlying structures and processes. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of these clusters with spatial b-value variations also led to more stable and reliable results for these clusters (Goertz-Allmann et al., 2021). Spatial b-value variations as estimated by Goertz-Allmann et al. (2021) are presented for clusters G, D3, D5, and C in Fig. 6\n. For each event within these clusters, the b-value was calculated using a fixed number of neighboring events and color-coded according to the calculated b-value. The magnitude of completeness was also estimated separately for each computation. We adjusted the input parameters depending on the individual cluster extent and overall number of events within a cluster. We used the closest 50 events for cluster C, 150 events for cluster D5 and G, and 300 events for cluster D3.\nIn the following section, we will focus on a more detailed description of clusters D1\u2013D7, C, and G, which (i) occur in the area for which 3D active-source seismic data have been reprocessed, and (ii) feature the highest numbers of events and high event density (Fig. 5). Moreover, the clusters are situated relatively close to the injection and\/or verification wells allowing for integration of further information.\n\n4.1.1\nClusters D1 to D7\nClusters D1 to D4 and D7 are altogether located in a E-W elongated region approx. between 356,500m and 357,000m North. Each of the clusters shows a NE-SW elongation in map-view, as demonstrated by the strike extracted from their event ellipsoids (\u226411\u00b0 strike difference, Table 1 and Fig. 5b). These clusters potentially delineate an en-echelon arrangement of faults which is geometrically described by their arrangement (e.g., separation or distance between faults, measured orthogonally to strike and overlapping length, measured along-strike) in plan-view. Clusters D1\u2013D3 overlap, and are separated by about 100m each (Fig. 5). D4 and D7 are both more separated from the previous clusters, and the overlap of D3 and D4 is smaller. Note that both D4 and D6 have been defined as clouds (Table 1), however, the strike of D4 is nevertheless consistent with the other clusters, which is not the case for cluster D6, which moreover is poorly constrained. In addition, the plane extracted from cluster D6 is the only sub-horizontal plane in this region and D6 was therefore excluded from further analysis.\nThe overall geometry of D5 is similar to D1\u2013D4 (Fig. 5) and it is aligned with D3. Between these clusters and cluster D5, two faults striking NE-SW and one striking E-W have been mapped in the sedimentary rocks overlying the basement. However, no seismicity is observed along these faults, and it is possible that they do not reach into the basement, where we observe events in D3 and D5. The southwestern terminations of clusters D1-D3 and D4 and D7 are located close to two WNW-ESE striking faults, that are potentially limiting seismicity or truncating the structures exhibiting seismicity, thus most likely reaching hypocentral depth.\nWell VW1 is located in the vicinity of cluster D4 (Fig. 5a) allowing a direct comparison of the cluster strike to fractures intersected by the well at basement depth as interpreted on FMI (see rose diagram in Fig. 5c, top left). Four main fracture sets have been recognized in VW1 at basement depth, striking NE-SW, E-W, N-S, and NW-SE. The strike of cluster D4, and similarly D1-D3, D5, and D7, are in good agreement with the NE-SW set of open bed-bounded or open continuous fractures. Clusters of seismicity were not observed to form parallel to the E-W, N-S and NW-SE striking sets of fractures. In addition, two main sets of fractures were interpreted above the basement, striking NNE-SSW to NE-SW and NW-SE. Additionally, 16 focal mechanisms have been computed using first-motion P-wave polarities for clusters D4, D5, and D7 (Fig. 5a) following the computational method by Langet et al. (2020) and, given the overall orientation of the cluster they belong to, they consistently suggest a dextral strike-slip mechanism on NE-striking fault planes. Two events in cluster D5 feature a strike-slip mechanism as well, but on E-W striking fault planes, highly similar to the focal mechanisms computed for cluster C, suggesting that they might be caused by structures similarly oriented to cluster C.\nThe b-values for cluster D3 (Fig. 6a) decrease along the strike with the highest value at the southwesternmost tip. The events to the southwest are also located at shallower depth compared to the events located to the northeast (Fig. 6c), indicating that the relative size of the events, and therefore the slip area, generally increases with depth.\n\n\n4.1.2\nCluster G\nCluster G is located north of clusters D1\u2013D7 (Fig. 5) and has a NE-SW overall orientation in map view. The northernmost limit of this cluster is sharp and rotated closer to E-W, consistent with one of the faults mapped in the sedimentary rocks overlying the basement and extended downward to the top of the basement (black lines in Fig. 5).\nBased on microseismicity, the cluster is highly linear south of 357,500m Northing and slightly curved north of it (yellow dashed line in Fig. 5) and, an E-W, but locally NW-SE, striking fault interpreted from the 3D seismic data, separates the region to the NE from the region to the SW. The cluster is located between a topographic basement high to the south and topographic low to the north with elevation differences of approx. 60m (Fig. 5). The events to the northeast are located comparably deeper in elevation, migrating downdip along the topography of the Precambrian.\nThe b-values for cluster G (Fig. 6) show variability along strike. The shallower events occurring on the southwesternmost tip are characterized by higher b-values while the deeper events occurring on the northeasternmost tip display lower b-values. This variation in b-value indicates that the relative size of the events, and therefore the slip area, generally increases with depth, similar to what we observe for D3. However, the change in b-values along strike for G is less gradual suggesting a larger structural complexity of this cluster compared to D3 or the interaction of cluster G with other structures. The lowest b-values are concentrated in the region north of 357,500m Northing, between two E-W striking faults.\n\n\n4.1.3\nCluster C\nCluster C has a strike of ca. 102\u00b0 and an elongation of approx. 340m. Centroid depth of this cluster is larger compared to clusters in region D (see Table 1), corresponding to the lower elevation for the top of the basement (Fig. 5).\nVW2 is located approximately 500m ESE of cluster C and two main fracture sets striking E-W to ESE-WNW and NNW-SSE to NW-SE were interpreted on FMI at this well at basement depths (see rose diagram in Fig. 5c, bottom left). The first set is consistent with the overall orientation of cluster C and with a fault trace interpreted in the sedimentary rocks overlying the basement, just south of the cluster. Fractures belonging to both of these sets were classified as open continuous or open bed-bounded. Fractures interpreted above the basement are NNW-SSE striking and mainly open bed-bounded. A fault intercepted by the well is oriented ENE-WSW. Freiburg et al. (2020) observed two sets of discontinuities across the upper part of the basement in the early processed seismic attribute cube: (i) NNW-SSE striking discontinuities, similar in orientation to the structural trend in the basement topography to the east and north of VW2 interpreted on the reprocessed active seismic data (Fig. 1) and one of the fracture sets observed in the FMI of VW2, and (ii) ENE-WSW striking discontinuities, similarly oriented to the faults across the basement low and healed fractures interpreted above the basement on the FMI of VW2 (Fig. 5c, bottom left). The latter was not recognized as one of the main sets in the FMI at basement depth.\nFurthermore, 23 focal mechanisms were computed for this cluster by Langet et al. (2020) and interpreted as sinistral strike-slip mechanisms on the slightly S of E and N of W oriented focal planes, consistent with both the overall 102\u00b0 orientation of the cluster in map-view and the known stress field.\nThe b-values for cluster C display a similar pattern to the other analyzed clusters D3 and G, events to the west show higher b-values compared to the events to the east. Furthermore, events to the west, which have larger hypocentral variability compared to the east, show higher b-values compared to deeper events. Therefore, this cluster also suggests that the relative size of the events, and therefore the slip area, generally increases with the increasing depth of the events. Because of the overall fewer events in this cluster and larger distances between the events compared to clusters D3 and G, the b-value variability is the least gradual with discrete part of the cluster displaying relative similar b-values. However, note that cluster C does not include many events and the standard deviation of these b-value estimates is much larger compared to the other analyzed clusters (Goertz-Allmann et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n4.2\nSpatio-temporal evolution of bursts and other patterns\nOverall none of the clusters have identified faults mapped with the seismic reprocessing (Fig. 5). Bursts and their structure are used to investigate possible structure internal to the clusters. An overview of the temporal evolution and location of the 35 recognized bursts is shown in Fig. 7\n. There is not a clear one-directional progression of the bursts with time, although bursts 1 to 17 occur in three clusters (D3, D2 and G), which are at increasing distance from the injection point. Consecutive bursts belonging to clusters D3 and G (e.g., Br1 to Br8 and Br10 to Br17), display general NE-alignments of the burst centroids (insets of Fig. 7).\nIn this section, consecutive bursts occurring in the three clusters D3, G, and C are analyzed. A majority of events in these clusters are well-located with low location uncertainties (average uncertainties of 2.6, 6.4 and 2m in the East, North and Depth directions), achieved through event relocation (see Fig. 1). Seismic events need to be analyzed in 4D to extract as much information as possible and, if the objective is to geometrically define underlying structures, views parallel and orthogonal to the linear best fit strike of the event cluster are highly beneficial. They allow to minimize apparent geometries and angles (e.g., real vs. apparent dip) for the clusters, simplifying the analysis of possible differences in orientation of bursts and clusters. To investigate the burst sequences in 4D, we construct composite figures (Figs. 8\u201311\n\n\n\n) that allow us: (i) to investigate faults defined by the spatial distribution of events both, along strike and dip, (ii) to display spatio-temporal patterns and (iii) to identify smaller structures that might be oriented differently to the cluster or parts of the fracture being reactivated at different stages.\n\n4.2.1\nCluster D3: Bursts 1 to 8 and Bursts 21 to 27\nThe first burst (Br1) occurred on February 26, 2012 (at 04:08:20 UTC), 2 days before the subsequent bursts (Br2 to Br8) took place within a period of less than 3 days (Fig. 8a). There is no clear correlation recognizable with injection rate or downhole pressure. The largest number of events occur in Br6 (141 events), however, the largest cumulative seismic moment (M0) is observed for Br7 and Br8.\nThese bursts occur in cluster D3 (with exception of one event, outlier in D2) which has overall elongation in direction 055\u00b0 (Fig. 8b).\nThe rotated map-view parallel to the cluster strike (Fig. 8c) and its orthogonal cross-section (Fig. 8d) are accompanied by histograms showing the distribution and number of events along and across the burst cloud. Histograms displaying the distribution of events with local Northing (Fig. 8c, left) show a relatively homogeneous distribution of events, suggesting that each burst is oriented similarly to the entirety of bursts, while the histograms oriented along local Easting (Fig. 8c top) reveal that Br7 and Br8 occur at the NE-termination of the cluster. This may indicate an expansion of the seismic cloud due to stress perturbations caused by earlier burst events (Br1-Br6) at the tip of the slipping fault.\nThe depth distribution of burst events in cluster D3 shows that events are mostly located below the top of the basement with few events in the Argenta formation (Fig. 8d, left). The depth histograms indicate that bursts Br1-Br6 migrated upwards (Fig. 8d, right). Particularly Br2, Br3, and Br6 show a similar geometry (strike and dip in Table 2). Although the overall cloud of events can be interpreted as a near-vertical structure, single bursts are steeply dipping to the NW (between 70\u00b0 and 55\u00b0) and could represent discrete slip-planes. It is interesting to note that the observed migration pattern of bursts is opposite to the overall migration pattern of events within cluster G and C as observed by Goertz-Allmann et al. (2017).\nOne year after Br8, seven bursts (Br21\u201327) reappear in cluster D3 (Fig. 9a), following bursts in cluster D2 and G. The first of these bursts occurs on February 15, 2013 (Br21) and the last on July 23, 2013 (Br27). Three injection shut-ins occur during the same period. Some bursts appear to align with injection shut-ins in Fig. 9a). This is a visual artifact of the compressed x-axis. Br22 and Br24 occurred during many days of stable injection and hours before any shut-in. B23 and Br25 occur at varying times into a shut-in alongside Br22 and Br24, respectively. No consistent correlation is observed with injection rates, pressure changes, pressure change with injection time length or time intervals after injection start-up or shut-in. A number of events of Br25 is distributed in cluster D7, therefore, we reported these events as Br25E (east) (see Table 2 and Fig. 7). The event centroids of Br25 and Br25E (see Fig. 7) are located at similar distance from CCS1 (411m and 494m, respectively).\nIn Fig. 9b and c, gray dots represent Br1 to Br8 and both these figures indicate that Br21\u201327 surround the earlier events, particularly in the NW and at the SW tip of the event cloud. This spatial distribution is also evident in the histograms in Fig. 9c. Furthermore, Br22\u2013Br23 and Br26\u2013Br27 are separated by a short time interval (Fig. 9a), suggesting that both bursts reactivate two patches of the same structure at different times.\nThe vertical cross-section orthogonal to the linear best fit strike of cluster D3 (Fig. 9d, left) illustrates that bursts Br21 and Br23 are located deeper, while the later bursts (Br24 to Br27) are located at shallower depth. Especially important is that, all events of Br22 are located at a similar depth. Br24 and Br25 seem also to deviate from the general cloud geometry, as they may together indicate a change in dip-direction above approximately 1980m depth and potentially indicate of small conjugate fractures (Fig. 9d).\nLater events (Br21\u2013Br27) surrounding earlier events (Br1\u2013Br8) suggest stress changes to the edge of the slip surfaces, caused by the slip on these early bursts, i.e. a possible observation of the Kaiser effect (Kaiser, 1950). It is interesting to note that earlier events (Br1-Br8) have a higher b-value of 0.98 compared to later events (Br21-Br27) with a b-value of 0.79, which indicates an overall increase in size and slip area.\n\n\n4.2.2\nCluster G: Burst 10\u201317 and Burst 20\nBr10 to Br17 occur in cluster G from June 15 to July 12, 2012 (south of 357,500 Northing; Fig. 10a; see also Fig. 7). Br11 to Br16 occur over the course of 3 days, 8 days after Br10. Br11 to Br13 seem to occur during a period of low injection rates just after a shut-in, although no obvious correlation of the downhole pressure with the burst activity is observed (Fig. 10a). Br17 occurs 14 days after Br16. Finally, Br20 occurs again in cluster G, but 155 days later and is plotted in Fig. 10c and d as black dots and histogram.\nThe linear best fit strike of cluster G is 054\u00b0 (Fig. 10b). Few events of these bursts take place within clusters D3 and D2, where earlier bursts transpired. Br11 to Br16 bursts show less distinct separation in both time and space in comparison to Br1-Br8 (Fig. 2c). Events occur often at similar locations in map-view, but within different bursts (see histogram in Fig. 10c top). Although this recurrence of events at the same locations partially obscures patterns, linear structures can still be interpreted (green dashed lines in Fig. 10c) and may indicate sub-parallel weakness zones being reactivated simultaneously. Extracting strike and dip from the combined burst event locations does not provide accurate values, but we can infer that the azimuth orientation of these bursts is similar to Br20.\nThe first burst in cluster G (Br10) defines the southwesternmost tip of the cluster. These events are located within a narrow 20m depth interval (between 1970m and 1990m BSL) and are aligned with the overall burst cloud (Fig. 10b\u2013c). Later bursts (Br15 to Br17) occur slightly deeper than earlier bursts (Fig. 10d, right). The events of Br20 are also located within a narrow depth range, similar to Br10. Both these clusters might indicate layers characterized by depth-confined fractures.\nAll events (except one, potentially mislocated event) occur within the basement (Fig. 10c).\nAs shown in Fig. 6, cluster G is characterized by a higher b-value toward the SW-tip of the cluster (corresponding to events within Br10). Goertz-Allmann et al. (2021) suggest that these events, which are constrained to a relatively thin depth interval, may point to stratabound fractures being reactivated. Higher b-values represent a larger number of small magnitude events, which is consistent with stratabound fractures of limited vertical length and thus slip area.\n\n\n4.2.3\nCluster C: Burst 33\u201335\nBr33 to Br35 occur in the northernmost cluster C from August 24, 2014 to January 21, 2015 (Fig. 11a). The durations of Br33 and Br34 are 8h 24min and 13h 56min, respectively and Br35 takes place 131 days after Br34 during the PH1 shut-in and is the only burst during the shut-in. Outside of the permanent shut-in, one temporary shut-in is observed during this period, but again, does not seem to correlate with burst activity (Fig. 11a). The overall cloud of cluster C has an elongation in direction of 102\u00b0 (Fig. 11b). A few events within Br33\u2013Br35 appear in clusters A and B at rather far distances from cluster C and in the most populated areas within these clusters (see Fig. 1). Such multi-location bursts (see e.g., Br35 and Br35S in Fig. 7) could potentially indicate local pressure increase due to heterogeneities. Fig. 11c and d focus only on the events within cluster C, which reduces the number of events in each burst as listed in the legend in Fig. 11c top. A clear eastward migration of the burst seismicity is observed, similar to the entire cluster. Br34 and Br35 are located deeper than Br33 (see Fig 11d). The azimuth of bursts is similar to the cluster orientation (Fig. 11c, left) and the bursts delineate steeply dipping structures.\n\n\n\n4.3\nClusters, bursts, and stress orientation\nBurst orientation is generally consistent with the cluster orientation they belong to (compare Fig. 5b left and center). However, in cluster G, burst analysis in plan-view showed linear features at an angle to the cluster strike (green dashed lines in Fig. 5b center and Fig. 10c). Although these linear features are partially obscured by events occurring at the same location, their strike is similar to Br20. These features represent a series of sub-parallel fractures that get reactivated almost simultaneously during the bursts.\nThe interpreted planes defined by the extracted geometry (strike and dip) from clusters and bursts (Tables 1 and 2) allow us to investigate the likelihood of that these structures to being reactivated in the current stress regime, using slip-tendency analysis. Due to the recurrent seismicity and the modest pore pressure increase from the injection, the planes extracted from clusters and bursts can be assumed to be optimally (max. slip tendency) to preferentially oriented (high slip tendency) to the stress field.\nThe tendency of a plane to slip (or slip tendency) in a given stress regime depends on the orientation and magnitude of the effective stresses acting on the fault surface and the friction coefficient of intact rock or pre-existing fracture or fault plane.\nSlip tendency T\n\ns\n [\u2013] can be expressed as the ratio of shear stress to effective normal stress on a surface:\n\n(1)\n\n\nT\ns\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c4 [Pa] is the shear stress and \n\n\u03c3\nn\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u2212\n\nP\nf\n\n [Pa] is the effective normal stress acting on the fault\/fracture plane, and P\n\nf\n [Pa] is the pore pressure.\nThe stress regime at Decatur is characterized by high horizontal stress (\u03c3\n\nH\n), with an average azimuth of 068\u00b0, as measured at CCS1 and inferred from breakouts and drilling induced tensile failures in all the boreholes. Measurements in the Mt. Simon and Eau Claire formations indicate that the stress regime is strike-slip (\u03c3\n\nH\n\n>\n\u03c3\n\nV\n\n>\n\u03c3\n\nh\n) with most likely localized normal faulting (\u03c3\n\nV\n\n>\n\u03c3\n\nH\n\n>\n\u03c3\n\nh\n) for materials with low elastic moduli. Information extracted from the basement indicate also a strike-slip regime (Bauer et al., 2016) as well as the focal mechanisms for events in regions C and D which suggest that the dominant stress regime at the hypocentral depth (approximately 2.3km TVD from ground level, within the basement) is strike-slip. Source mechanisms for larger earthquakes in other parts of Illinois and the surrounding area also are dominantly strike-slip (e.g., Lahann et al., 2017; Rupp et al., 2018). A range of stress magnitude gradients between 28.29MPa\/km and 43.11MPa\/km for the maximum principal \u03c3\n\nH\n, 24.48MPa\/km for the intermediate principal stress, and 24.48MPa\/km for the minimum principal stress has been measured at FutureGen (Cornet, 2014) and used in the slip tendency analysis. The three possible scenarios based on three different \u03c3\n\nH\n magnitudes for the strike-slip stress state are reported in Table 3\n.\nThe in situ hydrostatic gradient before injection derived from formation pore pressure monitoring was 10.3MPa\/km (Bauer et al., 2016) and was used to derive the principal effective stresses (Table 3). Pore pressure changes have not been included in the slip tendency analysis, since they are assumed to be small in the basement, where the seismicity is located.\nThe remaining unknown, needed for the slip tendency analysis, is the friction coefficient \u03bc, which is typically between 0.55 and 0.85 (yellow region in Fig. 12\na right). If we assume that the mobilized friction coefficient \u03bc\n\nm\n [\u2013] (defined as the cohesionless Coulomb failure envelope for the current stress state) is equal to the friction coefficient of the small-scale optimally-oriented fractures that fail, producing microseismicity, we can derive \u03bc\n\nm\n as the tangent to the Mohr circle.\nThe following slip tendency analysis employs the stress state at a depth of 2100m BSL (2307m TVD from ground level), where most of the seismicity is centered. At this depth, the mobilized friction angles \u03c6\n\nm\n are between 19.85\u00b0 and 35.01\u00b0 for the three possible scenarios for the stress state (Table 3 and Fig. 12a, right). Note that the friction angle is arctan(\u03bc).\nIn general terms, within the same stress regime, large variations in maximum horizontal stress magnitude only slightly affect the orientation of fractures displaying the highest slip tendency (Fig. 12a left). On the other hand, a change in orientation (azimuth and plunge) of the principal stress axes is strictly linked to the orientation of fractures that are optimally oriented (e.g., within the 95%, full contours). A change in the azimuth of the principal stresses determines a change in the strike of optimally oriented fractures, while a change in the plunge of the minimum and intermediate principal stresses determines a change in their dip. Therefore, even for a hypothetical larger gradient for \u03c3\n\nH\n, all the planes of focal mechanisms will not display the highest (95%) slip tendency. However, Fig. 12a shows that for case 3 (\u03c3\n\nH\n\n=43.11MPa\/km, Table 3 and Fig. 12), most of the focal mechanisms of region C lie within regions with the highest (95%) slip tendency, and therefore this value was used in the following analyses. The focal mechanisms were computed using an increment of 5\u00b0, which also corresponds to the accuracy of the focal plane orientation.\nThe orientation of clusters, bursts, and the fault planes from the focal mechanisms for region D, G and C are plotted on the slip tendency stereonets for a strike-slip regime with an average azimuth of 068\u00b0 for \u03c3\n\nH\n (Fig. 12b), using FracTend (Healy, 2021). Most of the planes show a good agreement: NE-SW striking, mostly steeply dipping to the NW dominantly in regions D and G, while the closer to E-W orientations of 102\u00b0 occur more in region C, mostly steeply dipping to the SSW. Because of the variability of the focal planes (Fig. 12b), we additionally plot the mean (MS) and the best solution (BS) for cluster C (as reported by Langet et al., 2020).\nBoth the slip tendency and the Mohr diagram (Fig. 12b bottom) suggest that cluster C, the E-W to ENE-WSW focal planes from focal mechanisms, and in general E-W to ENE-WSW striking fractures are optimally oriented to reactivation (>90%), while NNW-SSE to NW-SE striking fractures observed in the basement at VW2, as well as the structural trend in the basement topography similar to the set of discontinuities interpreted by Freiburg et al. (2020), both have the lowest slip tendency value (approx. 0.1, gray crosses in Fig. 12b bottom) and do not display seismicity.\nIn both regions D and G, the slip tendency and the Mohr diagram (Fig. 12b top and center) suggest that clusters, focal mechanisms and bursts are favourably oriented to slip, but plot at a small angle (up to ca. 10\u00b0) from the optimally oriented region for reactivation (>90%). N-S and NW-SE striking fractures measured at the VW1 have the lowest slip tendency value (approx. 0.1, gray crosses in Fig. 12b top and center), while E-W oriented faults are optimally oriented to slip, although only two focal mechanisms were observed in cluster D5 displaying this orientation.\nIn G, bursts are not optimally oriented, but this is expected since we observed that linear features were not properly captured by burst analysis and that they lie at an angle to cluster and burst orientation. The strike of these features is reported in the stereonet as green dots in Fig. 12b, Region G, center left, and they show generally higher slip tendency than the bursts in cluster G.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nWhen mapping the subsurface, detection of faults with active seismic imaging is often limited by the quality of the imaging and the wavelength such that faults with vertical displacement less than approx. 10m are difficult to resolve at large depths. Microseismic monitoring can provide additional information about subseismic structures when induced seismicity denotes the reactivation of small-scale faults, allowing the identification of unresolved smaller-scale weakness zones or fractures or faults with predominant strike-slip motions. During injections conducted far below the expected fracture pressure of a formation, new fractures are unlikely to be created. However, pre-existing fractures and faults that are critically stressed and preferentially oriented can be reactivated by slightly elevated pore-pressures due to fluid injection. During Ph1 at Decatur, the maximum pore pressure increase due to injection was only 5.4% within the areas in which seismicity has been observed (as monitored 300m from the injection well and 67m above the basement) (Williams-Stroud et al., 2020), implying that there is no potential for nucleating new fractures (hydrofracturing). However, the pore pressure increase within the pressure plume has a much larger spatial extent than the actual CO2 plume (both mainly contained within the reservoir), and this increase results in stress transfer, as demonstrated by the occurrence of microseismicity, that extends to an even larger area laterally and vertically.\nThe relocated events and the updated horizon interpretation of the reprocessed seismic data place more than 90% of the events within the basement. The porosity inversion of the reprocessed seismic data more clearly distinguished the top of the Argenta formation from the top of the basement, such that the basement surface was interpreted to be located up to 80m shallower in areas to the west and northwest of CCS1 with respect to the previous interpretation (Williams-Stroud et al., 2020). The elevation differences due to the change in horizon interpretation are shown in the composite plots (Fig. 8d, left; Fig. 9d, left; Fig. 10d, left, and Fig. 11d, left). As already observed in the previous catalogue, most of the microseismicity occurred during Ph1 and is located within the basement (Fig. 2); only a few events close to VW1 and SE of CCS1 occurred within the reservoir. During Ph2, a similar pattern is observed, with most of the events located in the basement (Fig. 2a). Seismicity bursts start occurring after approx. 4 months from the start of the injection at CCS1 and a similarly long delay (or perhaps slightly longer) from the end of the Ph1, marks the end of the burst-like seismicity (magenta lines in Figs. 2b and 3b).\nThe general lack of significant impedance contrasts within the Precambrian igneous rocks hinders the interpretation of faults, especially in case of minor offset faults, like at Decatur. Therefore, faults that were identified in the overlying sedimentary rocks and extended into the basement primarily based on geological characteristics such as their trace lengths and displacement magnitude, and on indications of disruptions of the seismic character in the basement. This may contribute to the lack of correlation between the faults interpreted from the active seismic volume and the faults derived from the microseismic clusters.\nCluster and burst analyses provide information complementary to the seismic interpretation, since the clusters are not along imaged fault traces. The burst within the cluster(s) have slightly different orientations which can indicate the arrangement of smaller fractures, or provide information on their fracture attributes. For example, we interpreted the linear bursts in cluster G to indicate a zone of stratabound fractures, where horizontal lithological boundaries limit the vertical extent of fractures. Furthermore, an E-W striking fault appears to mark the end of cluster G, and a sinuous fault-trace appears to mark the end of the development of Cluster G as consecutive bursts (see Fig. 5). If we only take the results from the cluster analysis, for cluster G we can use the semi-linearity (in plan-view) of a single approx. 780m long structure and assume, based on the typical length-displacement relationship (Kim and Sanderson, 2005), that the fault corresponding to cluster G should have a displacement that would be clearly visible within seismic resolution, assuming that this fault is not mostly strike-slip. Burst analysis suggests that this cluster is not one continuous structure, but is in fact composed of multiple sub-parallel weakness zones (Fig. 10c). These smaller structures suggest a shorter length of the slipping plane compared to a simplified interpretation based on the full extent of the cluster. Furthermore, interpreted stratabound fractures of Br10 and Br20 might indicate separate and distinct structures adjacent to cluster G. The spatial analysis of b-value yields higher values at the southwesternmost part of the cluster, at the location of Br10, supporting the presence of larger proportion of shorter fractures here, compared to the rest of the cluster, therefore supporting the hypothesis that cluster G is not indicative of one single continuous structure. Another interesting observation from burst analysis is the recurrence of bursts spatially close to earlier bursts within the same cluster (in particular Br1\u2013Br8 and Br21\u2013Br27). The slip on earlier bursts might have caused stress changes on the rim of the slip surfaces, where the later bursts took place, i.e. an observation of the Kaiser or stress memory effect. This phenomenon describes that during re-loading, the seismicity only occurs at the margin of areas having been active earlier, as long as the stress level is below the one exerted during previous loading cycles (Kaiser, 1950; Lavrov, 2003). Earlier events display a higher b-value compared to later events indicating overall larger events developing along growing fractures with time or the infiltration of fluid and pressure through early bursts that after slip, act as pathways. Last, the methodology used to select bursts from the catalogue allowed us to analyze if bursts occurring simultaneously at different locations may be indicative of similar pressure front conditions. This is for example the case of Br25 and Br25E, which are located at similar distances from the injection point. However, this was a single observation and a link to a defined pressure associated with the front would be highly speculative.\nThe slip tendency analysis of the strike orientation of the sub-vertical faults interpreted from active seismic data shows that in the defined stress regime (case 3 in Table 3), the N-S striking fault sets are not prone to reactivation, while the NE-SW and part of the E-W to WNW-ESE striking sets are optimally oriented for reactivation (thicker colored lines in Fig. 13\na). However, these optimally oriented structures are not associated with the recorded microseismicity in region D and along the E-W basement low, centered approx. around 357,800m Northing. This may suggest that these faults do not extend in the basement or that they are stronger (e.g., higher friction coefficients and cohesion) compared to the faults that display seismicity, which are not found on the active seismic interpretation. For instance, the fault south of clusters D1-D3 and, D4 and D7 could be limiting the seismicity (see Fig. 4), suggesting that it might extend down to hypocentral depth while not displaying seismicity despite its high slip tendency.\nThe slip tendency explains the seismicity of the northernmost cluster (C), which is optimally oriented under the stress regime (case 3, azimuth of \u03c3\n\nH\n\n=068\u00b0 and \u2207\u03c3\n\nH\n\n=43.11MPa\/km), as well as the interpreted fault planes from focal mechanisms for this cluster (thin line and dots in Fig. 13a, respectively). On the other hand, clusters in region G and D, as well as, the NE-SW striking fault planes from focal mechanisms in region D (thin lines and dots in Fig. 13a, respectively) are not optimally but merely preferentially oriented. The few E-W striking structures identified in the area of cluster D5 are supported by burst analysis (Fig. 5) and two focal mechanism solutions (Fig. 1), both of which are optimally oriented under the well-documented stress regime.\n\nFreiburg et al. (2020) suggested that the E-W basement low (Fig. 1), represents a lithological compartmentalization boundary for the basement (see Section\u00a02). This may imply that pre-existing fractures are oriented differently north and south of it (as also suggested by the fractures intercepted by VW1 and VW2, Fig. 5c) or that the mobilized friction coefficients might vary between these two areas, or that both cases are present. Optimally oriented fractures might not exist south of the basement low or have higher friction coefficients that impedes their slip; if this is the case, fractures that lie at a small angle to the optimally oriented fractures might be reactivated instead, if their friction coefficient is lower than the ones of the optimally oriented fractures.\nWe observed that a slight deviation (clockwise rotation) of the maximum horizontal stress azimuth of approx. 10\u00b0 from the average azimuth (068\u00b0) would have the NE-SW striking planes defined by the seismic clusters in region D closer to optimal orientation (Fig. 13b). In this hypothetical stress state, ENE-WSW striking structures along the basement low and N-S to NNW-SSE striking structures are not prone to reactivation, consistently with the lack of seismicity along this trend. This maximum horizontal stress orientation merely based on slip tendency analysis is within the spread of the azimuth of the drilling-induced maximum stress direction indicators and rather similar to the stress indicators from tensile induced fracture at the VW1 in the basement (Fig. 5b), thus it allows for an independent constrain of the maximum horizontal stress azimuth in region D, within the basement.\nNNW-SSE striking fractures that were observed in VW2 as open fractures above and in the basement (Fig. 5c) have the same strike as linear topographic features on the top of the basement (Fig. 13a), and in the same location as one of the discontinuity trends interpret by Freiburg et al. (2020), Fig. 13. In particular, one of the discontinuities interpreted by Freiburg et al. (2020) occurs at the westernmost tip of cluster C (thick gray line in Fig. 13a). Since structures with this orientation are not preferentially oriented to slip, it may extend to focal depth and represent a barrier to further extension eastward of the cluster. The strike of these discontinuities is similar to the orientation of the Charleston monocline located approx. 45km west of the Decatur site (Fig. 3). We speculate that these discontinuities observed at Decatur might have been caused by far-field stresses related to the same tectonic event.\nThe analysis of bursts allows us also to investigate the time progression of seismicity. At early stages of the injection, bursts occur progressively on clusters that are further away from the injection well (Br1\u2013Br17), but this is not the case for later stages (Br18\u2013Br35, Fig. 7). However, although the microseismicity is clearly triggered by the injection, no direct link could be established between burst initiations and either startup of injection periods or shut-ins. Therefore, the mobilized friction coefficient can be assumed to be close to the Coulomb failure envelope, which means that the basement is critically stressed.\nLast, we demonstrate that the three scenarios for the stress regime (Table 3) lead to very small changes in the strike of fractures for optimal orientation to slip (Fig. 12a), which alone cannot explain the different orientation of clusters north and south of the basement low.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we demonstrated that microseismicity complements active seismic data, particularly when seismic reflection imaging is either not of adequate resolution or when faults do not have sufficient vertical offset to be identified with confidence. Cluster and burst analyses contribute to the understanding of the geometry of pre-existing structures and their spatial arrangement with different levels of detail. This has important implications for the use of scaling relationship to estimate fracture size and expected event magnitudes.\nAt Decatur, a large majority of events occurs in the basement. Since faults interpreted from the active seismic data were extended from the overlying sedimentary rocks into the basement where fault indicators in the seismic imagery were more uncertain, they in practice might not necessarily reach the depth of the events. However, in cases that the lateral extent of clusters seems to be bound by interpreted mapped faults, it is possible that these faults do extend to the basement and acted as barriers to the extent of the structures illuminated by microseismicity.\nIn particular, we showed:\n- Cluster analysis allows definition of the overall orientation and shape of the structures. Furthermore, the large amount of events allows for a reliable extraction of statistical parameters (related to the geometry of the seismic cloud).\n- Bursts of seismicity are often concentrated in space and therefore resolve small-scale structures within the individual clusters. Multiple bursts within the same cluster indicate either slip on separate fault surfaces or partial slip on patches of a larger structure, that might be evidence of stress transfer or slightly different orientations than cluster orientation (e.g., en echelon faults).\n- Cluster and burst analyses, b-values and focal mechanisms are independent analyses and their integration assures their mutual interpretations. For example, the geometry of the clusters allows to discriminate between the focal plane and auxiliary plane when interpreting focal mechanisms, and the inferences on fracture size from burst analysis due to confined event location is consistent with interpreted fracture size from b-value analysis.\nFinally, we show that a slip tendency analysis of faults interpreted from the active seismic data, clusters and bursts, integrated with focal mechanisms, can provide insight about slight local deviations of the maximum horizontal stress azimuth from the average direction, lack of optimally oriented fractures in certain regions or suggest variability in the friction coefficient for differently oriented structures.\n\n","148":"","149":"","150":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe eastern Tibetan Plateau has received much attention for decades due to its high elevation with generally low relief, large complicated fault systems of strike-slip to thrusting type and special tectonic settings in which these structures form (Burchfiel et al., 1995; Royden et al., 1997; Tapponnier et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2009). All these characteristic features result from the Indian-Eurasian continental collision, which thickens the crust progressively since ~50 million years ago (Yin and Harrison, 2000), finally forming the highest plateau worldwide. Due to gravity, the elevated plateau tends to expand laterally. At the eastern margin (Fig. 1\n), its eastward movement was hindered by the rigid basement of the Sichuan Basin, thus producing a high topographic relief along the Longmen Shan fault zone, across which the average altitude decreases rapidly from ~6000\u00a0m in the eastern Tibetan Plateau to ~500\u00a0m in the Sichuan Basin (Burchfiel et al., 1995). In contrast, the topography along the southeastern margin decreases gradually without significant peaks (Clark et al., 2005). These topographic differences reflect variations in the tectonic environment of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, which promotes the formation of complex fault systems, such as the eastern Kunlun fault, the Xianshuihe fault and the Longmen Shan fault zone (Fig. 1). These large fault systems subdivide the eastern Tibetan Plateau into the Qilian-Qaidam Block, Bayan Har Block and Chuan-Dian Block, jointly controlling the seismic activity in this region (Fig. 1). Many disastrous earthquakes are related to these faults, which caused considerable damage and loss to human life and property. For example, the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake that occurred on the Longmen Shan fault zone has caused the largest financial loss and human fatality\/injury to China since the 1976 Tangshan Ms7.8 earthquake. Other damaging earthquakes, e.g., the 2013 Lushan Ms7.0 earthquake, the 2014 Ms6.3 Kangding earthquake (occurred on the Xianshuihe fault) and the 2017 Ms7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake (occurred on the Huya fault, F12), were all located in this area.\nThe slip rate on a fault is considered an important parameter to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the area and to assess its seismic potential. For example, regarding the deformation of the Tibetan Plateau, Tapponnier et al. (2001) suggested that the high slip rates along major strike-slip faults in the Tibetan Plateau accommodate the oblique subduction between Asian and Indian lithosphere and account for a large fraction of the present-day velocity field. Other studies suggested predominantly distributed deformation with relatively low rates of lateral fault slip to occur in the Tibetan Plateau (Clark et al., 2005; England and Houseman, 1986; Royden et al., 1997). With respect to seismic hazard assessment, fault slip rates can be used not only to calculate earthquake recurrence intervals (e.g. Shen et al., 2009) but also to estimate the magnitude of a potential earthquake on particular segments of a fault (e.g. Bai et al., 2018; Hergert and Heidbach, 2010). Given the important role of fault slip rates in the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau and its seismic hazard assessment for society, many relevant studies have been conducted in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, mainly using geological (Allen et al., 1991; Ansberque et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2018; Kirby et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2005; Ren et al., 2013a, 2013b) and geodetic observations (Gan et al., 2007; Li et al., 2018b; Shen et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2013) to determine the fault slip rates in the study area.\nHowever, due to the limited assumptions behind the geological and geodetic methods adopted in the aforementioned studies, their slip rate results inevitably have a systematic mismatch with one another. This is because the geological fault slip rate only represents the individual fault being measured, which is generally lower than the integrated slip rate of the fault system as a whole (Shen et al., 2009). In contrast, the geodetic slip rate tends to be higher than the actual slip rate since the internal deformation of the block is not considered if a rigid block assumption is applied (e.g. Shen et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2009). Moreover, the geological slip rate generally represents the mean slip rate of a fault over a longer time span, while the geodetic slip rate covers only a relatively short time span compared to the geological rate. Thus, the variation of fault slip rate with time may also account for this discrepancy. Zhang et al. (2013) emphasized that the internal deformation and block spins should not be ignored when describing the surface deformation of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, most previous work has focused on point-wise fault slip rates at specific locations, the spatially continuous fault kinematics are still not well understood. Some key information, such as how slip rate varies along the large faults and how the slip is partitioned among the various fault systems remains unclear. Therefore, more detailed and quantitative work is needed to reveal the contemporary kinematics in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.\nNumerical modeling provides a powerful tool to study the kinematics and dynamics of regions of sparse observational data (Heidbach et al., 2010). It can integrate the observational data from both geology and geodesy to derive a physics-based fault slip rate and distributed deformation in between according to the properties of rock and faults, and obtain a more reasonable and continuous fault slip rate distribution, thus improving the accuracy of seismic hazard assessment (e.g. Hergert and Heidbach, 2010). For the eastern Tibetan Plateau, several studies based on finite element modeling have been published (e.g. Liu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Luo and Liu, 2018; Zhu, 2013; Zhu and Zhang, 2013). However, these studies concentrated mainly on either the genesis of the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake or the stress evolution related to historical earthquakes within the particular study area. Little attention has been paid to the kinematic characteristics of the faults in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the complex 3D fault geometry is not accounted for in these models.\nTo fill this gap, we first establish a 3D finite element model of the eastern Tibetan Plateau including the faults by using extensive sets of geological, geophysical and geodetic data. Subsequently, we analyze the geomechanical modeling results with respect to stress and strain. This paper focuses particularly on the kinematic results revealed by the 3D geomechanical model, including the kinematic characteristics of the crust, fault slip rates and the pattern of deformation within this region. Finally, the seismic hazard of the main faults in the eastern Tibetan Plateau is assessed based on the kinematic modeling results.\n\n\n2\nModel concept and input\nModeling in this study involves three major steps, which are in order model design, calculation and results analysis. In the first step of model design, we construct a geometry model of the study area by integrating a complex 3D fault system and interfaces of the crust. For the calculation, we discretize the geometry model into unstructured meshes and then calculate the numerical solution of the equilibrium of forces on each mesh using the finite element method (FEM), based on appropriate initial and boundary conditions, and inhomogeneous rock properties. Finally, the modeling results are compared with model-independent observations, such as global positioning system (GPS) measurements, reported fault slip rates. The tectonic significance of the results and their implications on seismic hazard are discussed.\n\n2.1\nModel geometry\nThe geometry of the 3D geomechanical model has a cuboid shape with 679\u00a0km\u00a0W-E (100\u00b0E-107\u00b0E) and 669\u00a0km\u00a0N-S (28.5\u00b0-34.5\u00b0N) extension and a thickness of ~70\u00a0km (Fig. 2a). Since the topographic relief may affect the stress in the shallow crust (Liu and Zoback, 1992), the model considers topography using the GTOPO30 global digital elevation model (USGS) with a resolution of 30 arc-seconds. From top to bottom, the model is divided into four layers, namely the upper, middle, lower crust and the top layer of the upper mantle. The relief of the interfaces between these layers is taken from the CRUST1.0 model, which includes the depth of each layer with 1\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00b0 resolution derived from the latest active source seismic studies and receiver functions (Laske et al., 2013).\nAppropriate and detailed characterization of the fault geometry is of vital importance since it has a significant effect on the kinematics and the stress field of the crust. According to the difference in depth extent, the faults implemented in the model are divided into lithospheric-scale faults that penetrate the entire model down to a depth of ~70\u00a0km and crustal-scale faults that terminate at the bottom of the upper crust at ~20\u00a0km (Fig. 2b). This is consistent with the preferred occurrence depth of earthquakes in this area (Fang et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). The fault traces (Deng et al., 2003; Taylor and Yin, 2009) are used to constrain the upper termination of the faults. Information on the subsurface geometries of the faults comes from surface fault surveys, deep seismic sounding profiles, focal mechanism solutions, seismic tomography and receiver functions, etc. If there is no reference available to constrain the fault geometry at great depth (e.g. Xianshuihe fault), we assume that the fault plane becomes vertical downward according to the fact that a strike-slip fault typically occurs as a steeply dipping fault. The detailed geometric parameters of the faults implemented in the 3D geomechanical-numerical model and the corresponding references are listed in Table 1\n.\nFurthermore, many geophysical investigations conducted in the eastern Tibetan Plateau reveal the existence of extensive low-velocity or high conductivity bodies in the middle and lower crust (Jia et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2012). Such bodies represent mechanically weak zones of the crust and can be simplified as a detachment for crustal deformation (Li et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2008). This detachment is also portrayed in the model as a pre-defined slip surface between the upper and middle crust (Fig. 2a), i.e., depending on the stress conditions the upper crust can move relative to the middle crust. After a series of parameter tests, the effective friction coefficient on the detachment is set to zero.\n\n\n2.2\nRock properties\nIn the model, the rock rheology is set as linear elastic. Previous studies (e.g. Armijo et al., 2004; Hubert-Ferrari et al., 2003) suggest the continental crust at a large scale exhibits elastic-brittle behavior rather than elastic-viscous behavior, indicating that the continental crust has a long-term elasticity although it is not elastic at all depths. According to Yin and Harrison (2000), the model domain can be divided into two main tectonic units: the Songpan-Ganzi terrane and the South China terrane. The former terrane includes the eastern Bayan Har Block, part of Chuan-Dian Block and Qaidam-Qilian Block and the latter terrane refers to the Sichuan Basin (Fig. 2a). The rock properties for each tectonic unit are derived from P wave velocity according to the empirical relations (Brocher, 2005). The adopted values for the P wave velocities are based on deep seismic sounding results (Jia et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2003). Table 2\n lists all the material parameters used in the model.\n\n\n2.3\nCoefficient of friction\nThe faults implemented in this model are defined by pairs of so-called contact surfaces. Frictional sliding on these surfaces is governed by the Mohr-Coulomb friction law (Eq. (1)).\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c3\ns\n\n=\nC\n+\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u2212\n\nP\nf\n\n\n\n=\nC\n+\n\u03bc\n\u2032\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \u03c3\n\ns\n is shear stress, C cohesion, \u03bc coefficient of friction, \u03c3\n\nn\n normal stress, p\n\nf\n pore pressure, and \u03bc\u2019 is the effective coefficient of friction on the fault when considering the pore pressure.\nCohesion C is neglected in our model as we consider active faults (Jamison and Cook, 1980), and the effective coefficient of friction is set as 0.02. Although the coefficient of friction for crustal rocks obtained in laboratory experiments is within the range of 0.6\u20130.85 (e.g. Byerlee, 1978), previous studies suggest that the effective friction coefficients for large active faults in nature are generally much lower. For example, Zoback et al. (1987) found the shear stress on the San Andreas fault plane to be extremely low, implicitly indicating a very low friction coefficient; He and Lu (2007) revealed that the effective friction coefficient on the Xianshuihe fault is as low as 0.08 by using numerical experiments, which is of the same order of magnitude as that for the North Anatolian fault near Istanbul, Turkey (Hergert and Heidbach, 2010). We tested a series of effective friction coefficients ranging from 0 to 0.1 and found that a minimum misfit of observed velocities at the surface and modeled kinematic results for a coefficient of friction of 0.02 (Fig. 3\n). Meanwhile, long-term temperature records after the Ms8.0 Wenchuan earthquake imply that the effective friction coefficient of the Longmen Shan fault can be lower than 0.02 (Li et al., 2015), which provides further support that the friction coefficient assigned on the faults in our model is appropriate indeed.\n\n\n2.4\nKinematic boundary conditions\nIn this study, we used the GPS measurements obtained by Wang et al. (2017a) to derive the velocities at the boundaries of our model to simulate the tectonic loading process. A submodeling technique is applied to obtain accurate velocities at the boundary. This technique requires a larger scale global model to drive the local model by using interpolation of the nodal displacements from the global model. The nodal displacement of the global model can be calculated according to the Euler poles of lithospheric blocks included in the model (Wang et al., 2017a). The bottom of the global model is laterally unconstrained while vertical movement is not allowed. The surface of the global model is free. Fig. S1a shows the comparison between modeled results and GPS observations. Their differences are generally marginal in areas near the boundaries, but are obvious (both in direction and magnitude) in areas outlined by the dashed quadrilateral. To decrease the misfits, we adjusted the boundary conditions in two aspects: (1) an additional drag is applied with a velocity of 3\u00a0mm\/a eastward and 2\u00a0mm\/a northward at the base of the upper crust of the Bayan Har Block; (2) the northwest boundary of the submodel is pushed eastward at a velocity of 1.75\u00a0mm\/a and northward by 0.25\u00a0mm\/a. Fig. 4\n gives a detailed setting of the boundary condition. After these adjustments, the misfit between the modeled results and the GPS observations has decreased significantly, as is shown in Fig. S1. Thus, thus provides more accurate boundary conditions for the following submodeling simulation. For more detailed information about the submodeling technique, the reader is referred to Hergert et al. (2011).\nFinally, the 3D model volume is subdivided into about 2.91 million linear tetrahedral elements with a resolution of 1\u20132\u00a0km on the faults and\u00a0~10\u00a0km near the model boundaries. For the calculation, we used the commercial finite-element software Abaqus\u2122. The model time is set as 40,000\u00a0years, which is required to generate a proper contemporary state of stress and deformation until the accumulated displacements at the boundaries are propagated into the model.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nIn order to compare the modeled long-term velocities with GPS derived velocities which are representative of the interseismic period, we firstly simulated the interseismic velocities observed at the GPS sites by locking the faults in the upper crust and the results can be seen in Fig. S2. The modeled interseismic velocities compare well with the GPS observations and deviations are mostly within the uncertainties of the observations (Fig. S2). Subsequently, we unlocked the faults in the upper crust by lowering the coefficient of friction from infinity to \u03bc\u2019\u00a0=\u00a00.02 to obtain the long-term crustal velocities and continuous fault slip rates. Detailed results are presented below.\n\n3.1\nCrustal horizontal velocities\nInformation on the continuous crustal velocities in the study area as is extracted from the geomechanical-numerical model is shown in Fig. 5\n. Overall, the study area is dominated by a southeastward movement with a higher rate in the west and a lower rate in the east. Among the blocks within the study area, the Chuan-Dian Block moves faster than others with the highest rate of ~23\u00a0mm\/a in the north which gradually decreases to ~17\u00a0mm\/a in the south (Fig. 5). This is accompanied by a slight clockwise rotation of the direction of movement from SE to SSE. The Bayan Har Block has an east-directed velocity of ~16\u00a0mm\/a near the northwest corner of the model. Its velocity decreases to 9\u201311\u00a0mm\/a and rotates clockwise to a SE-direction after passing the Longriqu fault (F8). Both the Sichuan Basin and the Qaidam-Qilian Block are characterized by a nearly uniform SE-directed velocity of 7\u20138\u00a0mm\/a (Fig. 5).\n\n\n3.2\nFault slip rates on the main faults\n\n3.2.1\nSlip rate on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault\nThe central fault branch of the Longmen Shan fault zone (F3\u20137), namely the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (F4 in Fig. 1), ruptured over a segment as long as 240\u00a0km during the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake (Xu et al., 2009). Here, we extracted its kinematic characteristics from the 3D geomechanical model. Detailed results are shown in Fig. 6\n. In general, the modeled slip rate of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault is quite low within the range of 0.15\u20130.55\u00a0mm\/a and the slip is dominantly oblique-thrusting (Fig. 6a).\nThis is consistent with previous understandings that the Longmen Shan fault zone is of low slip rate and is a thrust zone with an additional sinistral slip component (Chen et al., 2000; Ma et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2009). As modeling provides the fault slip rate for the entire fault surface, the variation of the slip rate along the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault can be observed clearly although the slip rate in general is low. Divided by ~16\u00a0km south of Beichuan County, the slip rate on the northeastern segment (0.30\u20130.55\u00a0mm\/a) is higher than that on the southwestern segment (0.2\u20130.32\u00a0mm\/a) (Fig. 6a), except for the southwestern-most section. Similar to the slip rate, the slip direction (or rake) also has an obvious lateral variation. Fig. 6a shows that the hanging wall moves obliquely near Yingxiu and gradually changes to horizontal movement in the NE direction (see the black arrows in Fig. 6a) with the rake increasing from ~130\u00b0 to ~180\u00b0 (Fig. 6b).\n\nFig. 6c and Fig. 6d show the continuous distribution of slip rates of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault in the strike and dip direction, respectively. The variation pattern of the strike-slip rate is very similar to that of the total slip rate, also showing a higher rate in the north of Beichuan and a lower rate towards the south (Fig. 6c). The dip-slip rate around Beichuan is obviously high with 0.23\u20130.33\u00a0mm\/a (Fig. 6d). We infer that this high thrusting rate is related to the complex geometry of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault at this location. A more detailed discussion on this will be given in Subsection 4.4.\nIn addition, it should be noted that the southwestern-most section of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (to the SW of Baoxing in Fig. 6) in our model presents an oblique-slip normal fault with the rake ranging from \u2212130\u00b0 to \u2212180\u00b0. This result is opposite to the traditional view that the whole Longmen Shan fault zone is in a contractional regime, but consistent with the recent geological finding that there are several normal faults developed in the western hanging wall of the Wulong fault (the southwestern-most section of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault). No obvious evidence for reverse faulting was found there (Zhang and Li, 2010). We suggest that the normal faulting regime in this area may be caused by the high left-lateral slip and strike change of the Xianshuihe fault, which will be discussed in more detail in Subsection 4.3.\n\n\n3.2.2\nSlip rate on the eastern Kunlun fault\nFrom Fig. 7\n it can be seen that there is an obvious spatial gradient in slip rate along the eastern Kunlun fault. The slip rate gradually decreases eastward from ~6\u00a0mm\/a on the northwestern part of the fault to ~2\u00a0mm\/a at Tazang, and to ~0.25\u00a0mm\/a, i.e., almost no slip at the southeastern fault tip. In terms of the slip rake, the whole fault is generally dominated by a near horizontal movement, except in its southeastern segment (namely the Tazang fault), where the movement of the fault turns to oblique with a thrust component (Fig. 7).\n\n\n3.2.3\nSlip rate on the Xianshuihe fault\nThe Xianshuihe fault is a lithospheric-scale left-lateral strike-slip fault of ~350\u00a0km length, extending from Zhuwo (outside the study area) to the southeast through Luhuo, Daofu, Bamei, Kangding, Moxi to Shimian. In general, its trend rotates clockwise about 40\u00b0 from northwest to southeast (Wen et al., 1989) (Fig. 1). It cuts across the Songpan-Ganzi terrane and divides it into the Bayan Har Block and the Chuan-Dian Block, accommodating the movement difference between these blocks during the eastward spreading of the Tibetan Plateau and playing an important role in the tectonic evolution of the plateau.\nSimilar to the eastern Kunlun fault, the slip rate of the Xianshuihe fault also gradually decreases southeastward from ~12\u00a0mm\/a at Luhuo through 10\u00a0mm\/a at Kangding and finally to ~7\u00a0mm\/a at Shimian (Fig. 8\n). This variation pattern of modeled slip rates on the Xianshuihe fault is consistent with previous geological measurements (Allen et al., 1991; Chen et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2003). However, the slip rate near Kangding (~5.5\u00a0mm\/a) reported by Allen et al. (1991) is much smaller than the modeled ~10\u00a0mm\/a (Fig. 8). We infer that this obvious discrepancy primarily results from slip partitioning. The segment between Bamei and Kangding of the Xianshuihe fault splits into three fault branches, namely the Yalahe fault, Selaha fault and Zheduotang fault from north to south (Fig. 1). Allen et al. (1991)\u2019s 5.5\u00a0mm\/a slip rate was determined only on the Selaha fault. If the other two fault branches are considered as well, the overall slip rate of the Xianshuihe fault near Kangding is about 10\u00a0mm\/a (Bai et al., 2018), which is quite consistent with our modeling results.\nThe slip rate gradient along the Xianshuihe fault also shows a significant change (see Fig. 8). Divided by Kangding, the slip rate on the northwestern segment reduces gradually over 200\u00a0km from 12\u201313\u00a0mm\/a at Luhuo to 10\u201311\u00a0mm\/a at Kangding (Fig. 8), showing a slip rate gradient of 1\u00a0mm\/a\/100\u00a0km. In contrast, in the southeastern segment (namely the Moxi fault) starting at Kangding, the slip rate decreases southward from 10\u201311\u00a0mm\/a to 7\u20138\u00a0mm\/a within 100\u00a0km (Fig. 8), showing a much higher slip rate gradient of 3\u00a0mm\/a\/100\u00a0km. This significant lateral variation in slip rate gradient is inferred to result from the higher normal stress on the Moxi fault, which is caused by the clockwise rotation of the Moxi fault. We discuss this mechanism in more detail in Subsection 4.2.3.\n\n\n\n3.3\nFault slip partitioning in the eastern Kunlun fault system and the Longmen Shan fault zone\nGenerally, individual faults within a fault system always exhibit different slip rates due to the variation of their geometry, orientation or elastic interactions. The difficulty in collecting enough displacement data in the field for a fault system hinders obtaining a comprehensive picture of the displacement distribution on the various fault branches and partitioning of their slip rates. In contrast, data sets from the numerical model allow determining slip rate partitioning on a bunch of faults. In the following subsections, the slip rate partitioning result at the eastern termination of the Kunlun fault system and the Longmen Shan fault zone will be presented in detail.\n\n3.3.1\nThe eastern Kunlun fault system\nAt the eastern end of the Kunlun fault, the main fault (F1) branches into several smaller, subsidiary faults, such as the Minjiang fault (F11), the Huya fault (F12), the Wenxian fault (F13) and the Hanan fault (F14), thus, forming a south-vergent horsetail splay (Figs. 1, 9\n). From Fig. 9 it can be seen that the left-lateral slip rate of the eastern Kunlun fault decreases gradually from the 3\u20134\u00a0mm\/a at Axi to ~2\u00a0mm\/a at Tazang and almost stops at the eastern fault tip. Among the subsidiary faults, only the Huya fault has a significant slip rate of ~1.4\u00a0mm\/a, while the slip rates on other branches are as low as <0.4\u00a0mm\/a (Fig. 9). The modeled vertical velocity field shows that this area is dominated by uplift at a relatively high rate of 0.3\u20130.5\u00a0mm\/a along the Huya fault.\nThese results may indicate that the Huya fault accommodates the majority of the deformation produced by the eastern Kunlun fault. The distance between the eastern Kunlun fault and the various faults branches affects how effectively the strain is transmitted from the Kunlun fault to the other faults. The strain becomes more localized if the distance is reduced, leading to higher slip rates on the nearer fault branches. However, in our model, the Huya fault shows higher slip rates than the Minijang fault, although the latter is closer to the eastern Kunlun fault, the strike of the Huya fault is closer to that of the Kunlun fault. This indicates that in the strain transmission to the fault branches of the eastern Kunlun fault, the strike of a fault branch plays an important role. The relatively high slip rate of the Huya fault also means a faster strain accumulation process and a shorter recurrence time of large earthquakes, which may explain why earthquakes frequently occurred on this fault (Fig. 9).\n\n\n3.3.2\nThe Longmen Shan fault zone\nThe Longmen Shan fault zone, trending mainly NE-SW, consists of a series of thrust faults, which are from west to east the Mao-Wen fault (F3) and Qingchuan fault (F7), the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (F4), the Anxian-Guanxian fault (F5) and the range front blind fault (F6) (Fig. 1). As can be seen from Fig. 10\n, the modeled slip rate on all fault branches within the Longmen Shan fault zone is <0.6\u00a0mm\/a except on the Qingchuan fault (F7). Despite the low slip rate on each branch, the characteristics of slip variation can still be recognized. In general, the slip rate on the back range faults (F3 and F7) is higher and decreases gradually towards the Sichuan basin. For example, the Qingchuan fault (F7) and the Maowen fault (F3) have relatively high slip rates of ~1.1\u00a0mm\/a and\u00a0~0.6\u00a0mm\/a, respectively (Fig. 10). Slip rates decrease to 0.2\u20130.5\u00a0mm\/a on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (F4) and further to 0.1\u20130.3\u00a0mm\/a on the Anxian-Guanxian fault (F5).\nThe modeled rate of vertical motion at the surface (Fig. 10) shows that the Longmen Shan fault zone is predominated by uplift except for its southwestern end, where subsidence is predicted. The highest uplift rate of ~0.9\u00a0mm\/a occurs on the NW hanging wall of the Mao-Wen fault. Besides, the uplift of the hanging wall (the northwestern side of the fault trace) of each fault branch is larger than of the footwall (the southeast side of the fault trace). This implies that all these branches are reverse or transpressional faults, which in turn are consistent with previous geological and geophysical investigations (e.g. Jia et al., 2006; Li et al., 2006).\n\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nValidation of modeling results\nThe consistency between modeling results and model-independent observational data is the key to test the robustness of a geomechanical-numerical model. In this section, independent geodetic or geological observations (e.g. GPS and reported fault slip rates) will be used to validate our modeled results.\n\n4.1.1\nComparison of modeled crustal velocities with GPS observations\nAs mentioned in Subsection 2.4, the boundary conditions of our model are mainly constrained by the GPS data of Wang et al. (2017a). Here we compare our modeled surface velocities with the GPS dataset of Wang et al. (2017a) by extracting the velocities at the node nearest to each GPS station. Interseismic influence only matters in the vicinity of faults, i.e., at less than 50\u00a0km distance (Smith-Konter et al., 2011), which is quite small compared to the area covered by the model. The corresponding results together with the GPS observations are shown in Fig. 11\n.\nFrom Fig. 11, it is clear that the modeled velocities are in good agreement with the GPS-derived velocities. Deviations are mostly within the 95% confidence ellipse of the GPS observations, except for a few sites located near fault zones, such as at some locations along the Xianshuihe fault (F2) and at Kangxian near the Diebu-Mianlue fault (F15). These slight mismatches may be caused by interseismic strain. In our model, the faults are continuously slipping representing the long-term kinematics over many seismic cycles, whereas GPS observations represent the interseismic deformation where faults are assumed to be locked (Wang et al., 2017a). If we also lock the faults in the upper crust of the model and simulate the interseismic strain accumulation, the mismatch near faults especially along the Xianshuihe fault drops substantially (see Fig. S2), which provides evidence for the appropriateness of the long-term fault slip rates obtained by our model.\n\nFig. 12\n shows a NW-SE profile of GPS measurement and modeled velocities at the surface across the eastern Tibetan Plateau, in which the modeled velocities fit well with the GPS velocities not only in variation trend but also in magnitude.\n\n\n4.1.2\nComparison of modeled fault slip rates with reported ones\n\nTable 3\n is a compilation of reported fault slip rates in the study area. In general, the fault slip rates in the eastern Tibetan Plateau are determined predominantly by the geological methods, while the slip rates of some large faults, such as the eastern Kunlun fault, the Xianshuihe fault and the Longmen Shan fault zone, are determined by geological and geodetic methods (as listed in Table 3). The comparison between our modeling results and those model-independent geological or geodetic slip rates is shown in Fig. 13\n.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 13, the modeled fault slip rates are generally consistent with the rates published in previous studies. For example, for the eastern Kunlun fault (F1), the modeled slip rate gradually decreases eastward from ~6\u00a0mm\/a to almost 0\u00a0mm\/a at its eastern tip, which is a similar distribution as revealed by point-wise geological measurements at corresponding sites which indicate a slip rate of the western segment of the fault of about 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mm\/a and a decrease to 1.4\u20133.2\u00a0mm\/a in the eastern segment near Ruoergai basin (Kirby et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2013b). A similar agreement between modeled and measured slip rates also exists for the Longmen Shan fault zone (F3\u20137), the Longriqu fault (F8) and the Xianshuihe fault (F2) (Fig. 13). Furthermore, the fault slip senses predicted by the model are fully consistent with those observed in the field.\nThe general agreement between our modeled and the reported fault slip rates indicates that the 3D geomechanical model constructed in this study can reveal the main kinematic characteristics of the eastern Tibetan Plateau to a large extent, which lays a firm foundation for further studying the tectonic evolution of the crust and the seismic hazard in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.\n\n\n\n4.2\nFault slip rate characteristics and implications on crustal evolution and seismic hazard assessment\nIn general, the modeling results show that slip rates on the NW-SE-trending faults are usually much larger than on the NE-SW-trending faults (Fig. 13). For example, the Xianshuihe fault (F2) and the eastern Kunlun fault (F1) have high slip rates of 12\u00a0mm\/a and 6\u00a0mm\/a, respectively. In contrast, the slip rates on the branches of the Longmen Shan fault zone (F3\u20137) are generally <1\u00a0mm\/a. We suggest that this first-order characteristic of slip rates on these faults is closely related to the angle between the direction of crustal movement and the fault strike. Faults with high slip rates, such as the Xianshuihe fault and the eastern Kunlun fault, are almost parallel to or have an acute angle with the direction of movement of the crust, such as the Xianshuihe fault and the eastern Kunlun fault (Figs. 5, 11, 13). In contrast, for faults with a low slip rate, the crustal movement always intersects at a high angle with the fault strike. For example, the NE-SW-trending Longmen Shan fault zone is nearly perpendicular or at a high angle to the southeastward movement of the Bayan Har Block.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the fault slip rate is considered to be a key parameter to study the tectonic evolution of the crust and the assessment of seismic hazard. In the following, we will discuss the fault slip rate characteristics of important faults in the study area and implications for the evolution of the crust and seismic hazard.\n\n4.2.1\nSeismic hazard of the Longmen Shan fault zone\nOur modeling results show that the slip rate of the Longmen Shan fault zone is fairly low with <0.6\u00a0mm\/a on each branch except the Qingchuan fault (F7) (Fig. 10). These results are consistent with previous studies (e.g. Gan et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2017b; Zheng et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2006). The modeled slip rates of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (F4) are higher on the northeastern segment (Figs. 6, 10), which is in line with the higher recurrence rate of strong aftershocks (Li et al., 2018a) and paleo-earthquakes (Ran et al., 2014) on this segment. However, the modeled slip rate distribution pattern for the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault is opposite to that revealed by previous findings according to which the strike-slip rate of the northeastern segment is lower than that of the southwestern segment. For example, Shen et al. (2009) used GPS velocity data to invert for the fault slip rates in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. They found that the right-lateral slip rate of the northeastern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone is 0.8\u00a0mm\/a, slightly lower than the 1.7\u00a0mm\/a of the southwestern segment. Similar results were also presented by the GPS-based work of Wang et al. (2017b) and Zheng et al. (2017). We infer that the discrepancy between our modeled slip rates and the previous findings may be caused by the different assumptions made to derive slip rates from the GPS observations. The geomechanical-modeling derives a physics-based fault slip rate based on the properties of rock and faults, while these other studies usually assume rigid bodies, thus neglecting internal deformation; assume a 2D model, thus neglecting the 3D geometry of the fault system and the 3D kinematics; or assume just one simple fault for the Longmen Shan fault zone, thus neglecting the detailed fault pattern we have considered in the model. The change of velocity through a long-time span may also contribute to this discrepancy. Such differences could make our results differ from their results although the same GPS data are used as a basis.\nIn relation to this, the intersection angle between the direction of movement of the Bayan Har Block and the strike of the Longmen Shan fault zone decreases northeastward along the fault from almost perpendicular in the SW to acute in the NE (Figs. 5, 10, 11). This leads to a decrease of the normal stress and an increase of the shear stress on the fault plane towards the NE, thus facilitating slip on the northeastern segment of the fault zone. A higher fault slip rate and lower normal stress are conducive to release the limited strain energy accumulated on the fault with a shorter earthquake recurrence period. Therefore, we infer that the accumulated strain energy on the northeastern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone is released through more frequent but smaller earthquakes, whereas large but less frequent earthquakes like the Wenchuan Ms8.0 and the Lushan Ms7.0 earthquake occur on the southwestern segment.\n\n\n4.2.2\nSlip on the eastern Kunlun fault promotes the Minshan Uplift\nAs revealed by our model, the modeled slip rate on the eastern Kunlun fault gradually decreases eastward from ~6\u00a0mm\/a to the west of Maqu to almost no slip at its eastern tip (Fig. 7). This decreasing trend of slip rates is consistent with previous studies (e.g. Kirby et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011). Kirby et al. (2007) reported that the fault slip rate to the west of Maqu is as low as 2\u00a0mm\/a and decreases further to <1\u00a0mm\/a from the Ruoergai basin eastward. Li et al. (2011) and Ren et al. (2013b) determined the slip rates on the eastern Kunlun fault at Maqu and on the Tazang fault to be 4.9\u00a0mm\/a and 1.4\u20133.2\u00a0mm\/a, respectively, i.e., much higher than the results of Kirby et al. (2007). In terms of the magnitude of fault slip rates, our modeled results are much higher than the 2\u00a0mm\/a and\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0mm\/a measured at corresponding sites by Kirby et al. (2007) (see Fig. 13), but are in good agreement with the long-term slip rate obtained by Li et al. (2011) and Ren et al. (2013b). Our work indicates that the eastward decrease of the left-lateral slip rate of the eastern Kunlun fault is not that fast as given in Kirby et al. (2007). The modeled slip rate remains at a relatively high level of 3\u20134\u00a0mm\/a after passing through the Ruoergai basin (Fig. 13), which is consistent with the upper limit of the geological results in Ren et al. (2013b).\nThe slip rate of the eastern Kunlun fault plays a key role in distinguishing the deformation pattern of the Minshan Uplift. For example, Kirby et al. (2007) suggested that such low slip rates of the eastern Kunlun fault as determined in their study, cannot explain the formation of the Minshan Uplift, if only the crustal shortening caused by the horizontal fault slip is considered. Instead, they suggested that the thickening of a weak lower crust might contribute to the Minshan Uplift. On the contrary, the higher slip rate revealed by Li et al. (2011) and Ren et al. (2013b) indicates that the uplift of Minshan has probably resulted from crustal shortening, which arises from the decrease in the left-lateral slip rate of the eastern Kunlun fault from northwest to southeast. The slip rate of the eastern Kunlun fault revealed by our model supports the viewpoint that crustal shortening is the major mechanism to uplift the Minshan.\nIn addition, among the branches of the eastern Kunlun main fault, the Huya fault (F12) has an obviously higher slip rate than others, which promotes the hanging wall uplift faster, making the Minshan Uplift tilting towards the west (Fig. 9). However, our modeled tilting rate (~0.2\u00a0mm\/a), namely the difference in vertical velocity between the Huya and Minjiang Fault, is much lower than that of >10\u00a0mm\/a obtained by Kirby et al. (2000). The left-lateral strike-slip faulting of the 2017 Jiuzhaigou Ms7.0 earthquake and the 1976 Songpan earthquake swarm indicates that the Huya fault is very active to transfer the Minshan Uplift towards SSE. We speculate that the Huya fault may have extended SSE-ward into the Longmen Shan fault zone. More details will be discussed in Subsection 4.3.\n\n\n4.2.3\nSeismic hazard of the Xianshuihe fault\nThe modeled slip rate of the Xianshuihe fault (F2) decreases from northwest to southeast with a variable slip rate gradient, which is greater on the southeastern segment (Moxi fault) (3\u00a0mm\/a\/100\u00a0km) than on the northwestern segment (1\u00a0mm\/a\/100\u00a0km) (Figs. 8, 13). This change in slip rate gradient is attributed to the change of the intersection angle between the Xianshuihe fault strike and the movement direction of the Chuan-Dian Block. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that in the northwest segment of the Xianshuihe fault (from Luhuo to Kangding) (F2), the Chuan-Dian Block moves nearly parallel to the strike of this segment. In contrast, due to the clockwise rotation of the Moxi fault (from Kangding to Shimian), the block's movement direction in the southeast segment is oblique to the fault strike. Based on a simple mechanical analysis, this change in the intersection angle will make the Moxi fault suffer a greater compression from the Chuan-Dian Block, which can be evidenced by the high crustal convergence rate across the Moxi fault revealed by GPS observations (Wang et al., 2017b) and the existence of secondary thrust faults near it (Fig. 1). This strong lateral compression imposed on the Moxi fault further increases the frictional forces on the fault plane and consequently reduces the fault slip rate rapidly (Fig. 8).\nHowever, a low fault slip rate does not mean a low seismic hazard, which is a painful lesson that has been learned from the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake (Zhang, 2013). The kinematic and structural analyses of the Moxi fault outlined above, indicate, that the frictional strength on the Moxi fault is high, which on one hand hampers fault slip but on the other hand permits the accumulation of high shear stress as the Chuan-Dian Block continuously moves southeastward. If the stress accumulated on the fault reaches the rock strength, the stored energy will be released all of a sudden, forming a large earthquake. The latest strong earthquake that occurred on the Moxi fault was in 1786 with a magnitude of Ms7.75. Assuming the entire Moxi fault (100\u00a0km) is locked from surface to 20\u00a0km depth and its long-term average slip rate of 9\u00a0mm\/a is accommodated by the accumulation of strain energy, the accumulated energy during the past 235\u00a0years can produce an Ms7.4 earthquake (the rock shear modulus \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a034\u00a0GPa is calculated from E and \u03bd, see Table 2).\nDue to the relatively low slip rate and low historical seismicity (Wen et al., 2008) on the Moxi fault the seismic hazard on this fault may be underestimated. However, based on the above analyses, we emphasize that the Moxi fault has a high potential to generate a strong earthquake and should be carefully and closely monitored. It is worth noting that this assessment of the potential earthquake magnitude does not consider aseismic creep on the Moxi fault, which is thought to be as low as 0.5\u00a0mm\/a (Wen, 1990) and thus has little effect on the magnitude assessment.\n\n\n\n4.3\nThe genesis of normal faulting at the southwestern end of the Longmen Shan fault zone\nAs mentioned in Subsection 3.2.1 the kinematics of the southwestern-most section of the Longmen Shan fault zone is characterized by a normal faulting regime, as manifested by the downward motion of the hanging wall (Fig. 6). Although this normal faulting regime is apparently inconsistent with the widely distributed thrusts in this fault zone, which were formed due to two or more deformation phases during the last 50\u00a0Ma (Wang et al., 2012), the existence of the normal faulting regime in the southwestern-most section of the fault zone is supported by new evidence from field observations and in situ stress measurements. For example, Zhang and Li (2010) conducted detailed fieldwork in the southwestern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone and found that there is no obvious compression in that segment since the Late Pleistocene. Besides, they also found several E-W-trending normal faults developed in the hanging wall of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (near Baoxing) with an age of ~40\u00a0ka, which reveals an N-S-trending extension in this area formed in the Late Pleistocene. Furthermore, the in situ stress measurements of Meng et al. (2015) show that the average horizontal stress is decreasing from Yingxiu to Kangding. Wu et al. (2013) also reported abnormally low horizontal stresses in Kangding. These observations and measurements provide compelling evidence for the existence of a normal faulting regime at the southwestern end of the Longmen Shan fault zone.\nTo explain this phenomenon, we consider that normal faulting at the southwestern end of the Longmen Shan fault zone is closely related to the high left-lateral slip rate of the Xianshuihe fault and the clockwise rotation of its strike. As shown in Fig. 14\n, there is an obvious subsidence zone along the Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault (F2) and to the north of Kangding with a maximum subsidence rate of 0.7\u00a0mm\/a. At the southeastern margin of the subsidence zone, the southwestern-most section of the Longmen Shan fault zone (F3, F4) is driven by subsidence, making the northwestern hanging wall subside faster, thus forming a normal faulting regime. The existence of the subsidence zone indicates that the area to the north of the Bamei-Kangding segment is dominated by extensional deformation, as has been revealed by GPS measurements (e.g. Cheng et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2007).\nIn terms of the genesis of the extensional environment on the Bamei-Kangding segment and its north, we infer that this is caused by the left-lateral slip of the Xianshuihe fault with a clockwise rotation of its strike. As illustrated by Fig. 15\n, near Kangding, the strike of the Xianshuihe fault rotates clockwise from NW-SE to NNE-SSE, so the movement of the Chuan-Dian Block along the fault is affected by this curved fault and changes from southeastward to almost southward. This change in block movement direction will produce N-S-trending extension to the north of Kangding, which initiates the subsidence along the Bamei-Kangding segment and further promotes normal faulting on the southwestern-most section of the Longmen Shan fault zone.\nThe effect of the Xianshuihe fault on the southwestern-most section of the Longmen Shan fault zone is also manifested by the change in the Coulomb failure stress (\u0394CFS) along the Longmen Shan fault zone caused by large historical earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault. Liu et al. (2018) and Liu et al. (2020) calculated the total \u0394CFS induced by the 14 large earthquakes which have occurred on the Xianshuihe fault and found that the Longmen Shan fault zone is covered by a stress shadow, especially at its southwestern end. Our modeling results explain the findings of Liu et al. (2018) and Liu et al. (2020) and clearly reveal that normal faulting on the southwestern end of the Longmen Shan fault zone is caused by the left-lateral Xianshuihe strike-slip fault. This normal faulting essentially relaxes the concentrated stress produced by the southeastward movement of the Bayan Har Block and therefore effectively decreases the normal stress on this segment. Considering the higher slip rate and lower normal stress on this segment than that on the adjacent section to the northeast (Fig. 6), we infer that the recurrence time of earthquakes in the southwestern-most section of the Longmen Shan fault zone would be shorter than that of the middle segment, which is consistent with paleoseismic investigations in this area (Wang et al., 2015).\n\n\n4.4\nThe effect of the Huya fault on the Longmen Shan fault zone\nAssuming the Huya fault (F12) extends southward far enough, it will intersect the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (F4) at a high angle near Beichuan and can be linked to the Longquan Shan anticline in the Sichuan basin (Fig. 15). Chen et al. (2007) suggested that the fault along Huya-Beichuan-Aaxian, called Leidong fault in their study, is a left-lateral strike-slip fault with an additional thrust component, and offsets the Longmen Shan fault zone. During the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake, a NW-SE-trending surface rupture, called Leigu fault (see Fig. 16b), developed in Leigu town near Beichuan having a length of ~5\u00a0km and a large dip angle (Tan et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2009). According to the good correspondence of the location and strike between the short Leigu fault and the long Leidong fault, we consider that the rupture of the Leigu fault during the Wenchuan earthquake is a reactivation of the preexisting Leidong fault, which implies that the Huya fault has penetrated into the Longmen Shan fault zone.\nAnother evidence for the effect of the Huya fault on the Longmen Shan fault zone is the complex fault geometry at the supposed intersection. Relocation of the aftershocks of the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake shows that these small-to-moderate events clustered mainly in two areas: one is around the mainshock near Yingxiu; the other is near Beichuan, where the Huya fault intersects the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (Shen et al., 2009) (Fig. 16a). The aftershock cluster near Beichuan reveals that the geometry of Yingxiu-Beichuan fault may change strongly, making it easy to concentrate stress after the mainshock and then release the accumulated energy through aftershocks. A clearer illustration of the complex geometry of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault beneath Beichuan was obtained by Wan et al. (2017) using inversion techniques of geodetic data, showing that the fault surface has a curved geometry protruding to the southeast with variable fault dips (Fig. 16c). We attribute the formation of the complex fault geometry of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault near Beichuan to the push of the Huya fault, which has a relatively high left-lateral slip and moves southward almost perpendicular to the strike of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (Fig. 10). The continuous pushing of the Huya fault (F12) leads to the geometric distortion of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (F4) at the intersection area, thus forming the curved fault structure (Fig. 16b, c). The high left-lateral slip rate of the Huya fault, the NW-SE-trending rupture of the Leigu fault, and the westward deflection of the Longquan Shan anticline together reveal that the Huya fault may have penetrated into the Longmen Shan fault zone and transmits partially the deformation of the Minshan Uplift into the sedimentary cover of the Sichuan Basin.\nIn addition, it should be noted that the two areas with the maximum XI seismic intensity of the Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake are both located at the intersections between the Longmen Shan fault zone and the NNW- or NW-trending faults (Fig. 16a). One is near Beichuan as described above, the other is near Hongkou, where the NW-SE-trending Lixian fault penetrates the Longmen Shan fault zone (Li et al., 2019). It is considered that the complex fault geometries in these two areas may play an important role in the formation of the high seismic intensity zones. Therefore, we suggest that more deep investigations on the NW-NNW-trending faults should be conducted in the future to better assess the seismic hazard along the Longmen Shan fault zone.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, we established a 3D finite element model of the eastern Tibetan Plateau by using extensive collections of geological, geophysical and geodetic data. The model includes a complex 3D fault geometry in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Numerical modeling results provide a continuous quantitative description of displacements which can be used to study the kinematics in the study area, among others.\nThe inferred slip rate on the Longmen Shan fault zone is as low as 1\u20132\u00a0mm\/a and on each fault branch, the rate is < 0.6\u00a0mm\/a except for the 1.1\u00a0mm\/a rate on the Qingchuan fault. The northeastern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone has a relatively higher slip rate and a lower frictional resistance than the southwestern segment, which suggests that the northeastern segment tends to produce more frequent but lower magnitude earthquakes than the southwestern fault section.\nA substantial variation of the slip rate gradient along the Xianshuihe fault is revealed. Separated by Kangding, the slip rate gradient on the northwestern segment is 1\u00a0mm\/a\/100\u00a0km, while on the southeastern segment it increases to 3\u00a0mm\/a\/100\u00a0km. We attribute the variation of fault slip rate gradient to the clockwise rotation of the Xianshuihe fault from NW-SE to NNW-SSE near Kangding, which makes the southeastern segment (Moxi fault) suffering a greater lateral compression from the Chuan-Dian Block and higher frictional resistance, thus decreasing the fault slip rate rapidly. We estimate the accumulated strain energy since the last large earthquake on the Moxi fault could generate an earthquake with a magnitude of Ms7.4.\nThe southeastward movement of the Chuan-Dian Block combined with the clockwise rotation of the Xianshuihe fault leads to extensional deformation on the Bamei-Kangding segment and to the north of it. It also causes normal faulting on the southwestern-most section of the Longmen Shan fault zone, which makes the fault slip easier with a shorter recurrence time of earthquakes than that of the middle segment.\nFinally, our model shows that the slip rate of the eastern Kunlun fault decreases eastward with an almost linear gradient, i.e., from ~6\u00a0mm\/a in the west of Maqu to almost zero at the eastern fault tip. The slip deficit is mainly compensated by distributed crustal uplift and the slip on the Huya fault. The Huya fault may have penetrated into the Longmen Shan fault zone and transmits partially the deformation of the Minshan Uplift into the sedimentary cover of the Sichuan basin. Since the complex fault geometries at the intersections between the NW-NNW-trending faults and the Longmen Shan fault zone correspond to high seismic intensity zones, we suggest more efforts to investigate the NW-NNW-trending fault system in this area to better assess the seismic hazard in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.\n\n\nAuthor-statement\nXianrui Li: modeling, results analysis, manuscript preparation Tobias Hergert: software usage guiding, idea discussion, manuscript editing Andreas Henk: providing computing platforms, idea discussion, manuscript editing Zuoxun Zeng: idea discussion.\n\n","151":"","152":"","153":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nIn earthquake geology and mechanics, the characterization of surface deformation is crucial, especially when the coseismic rupture reaches the surface from the seismogenic depth (Anastasopoulos et al., 2007). The geometry of the rupture trace at the ground surface, rock mechanical properties and coseismic slip profiles can be used to refine the seismic sources models, and to better assess the seismic hazards. The conditions for fault slip to reach the ground surface are depending on the rupture mechanism, the stress conditions at depth and, the geology of subsurface rocks and complex stress perturbations close to the topographic surface (Avar and Hudyma, 2019). The presence of previous fault ruptures may influence the location of the more recent surface fault ruptures. Although the mechanism of fault rupture propagation to ground surface mainly depends on crustal geology and tectonics, field studies after earthquakes highlighted the effects of near-surface deposits, if they exist, on the width and architecture of the outcropping fault rupture. This is apparently truer in the case of reverse faults than in the case of normal or strike slip faults (Avar and Hudyma, 2019). The primary origin of the surface ruptures (i.e., surface ruptures due to slip on the fault responsible for seismic energy release) is thus sometimes difficult to demonstrate. This is one reason why multiple analyses may show that in general coseismic fault slip at the surface is less than slip at depth. One explanation is the velocity-strengthening behavior of the shallow faults (Scholz, 1998). Nevertheless, Noda and Lapusta (2013) highlighted that, if the dynamic weakening is activated, the coseismic slip at the surface could be larger than the slip at depth. Yet total slip which includes coseismic slip and aseismic slip at the surface tends to equal total slip at depth over multiple earthquake cycles. Dolan and Haravitch (2014) observed that such a deficit of apparent shallow slip was higher on immature fault zones (<25\u00a0km total displacement) where it may be accounted by off-fault distributed deformation.\nThe main mitigation approach of the hazard related to surface fault ruptures is to set infrastructures far enough from the active fault. This is usually done through a site-specific investigation aiming at identifying the fault location and whether or not this fault is active. Current investigations involve mapping fault traces, trenching to identify past activity from perturbations of the shallow sediments stratigraphy, coring to identify fault materials and eventually characterize their properties later at laboratory scale (Avar and Hudyma, 2019). Some shallow subsurface geophysics can also be deployed to image fault offset at depth. One of the main difficulties in site investigations is to determine whether the fault mapped at a trench is active or inactive. Hart et al. (1993) and Lienkaemper et al. (1991) showed that almost half of the new surface ruptures localize outside zones established from such investigations. Moreover, when no shallow sediments mark the fault offset(s), it is almost impossible to determine if the fault is potentially active.\nFaults are several meter to hundreds of meter thick zones made of complex highly deformed fractured and low cohesive materials. It is usually considered that fault zones contain core zones where the largest shear displacements localize surrounded by a fractured damage zone (Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009). Such structural complexity induces a strong variability of fault zones hydromechanical properties that influence poroelastic behavior (Jeanne et al., 2014, 2017), state of stress (Barton and Zoback, 1994), fault frictional evolution and earthquake nucleation (Aki, 1995; Guglielmi et al., 2015a, 2015b; Cappa et al., 2019). For these reasons the characterization of fault properties at the meter to tens-of-meters scale, which is the proper fault zone scale in the field, and a better understanding of how these \u201cfield scale\u201d fault properties influence the mode of fault activation are major issues in seismic risk assessment.\nHere we focus on faults that were activated near the Pacific coast at the Ibaraki-Fukushima prefecture 1 month after the occurrence of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Fig. 1\n). A shallow normal faulting earthquake sequence occurred with roughly E\u2013W or NW\u2013 SE extension direction, characterized by the April 11, 2011 Fukushima-ken Hamadori Earthquake of Mw 6.7 (Yoshida et al., 2015). In details, rupture initiated on the Itozawa fault propagating mainly up dip and NW (Tanaka et al., 2014). It then triggered a rupture on the Yunokade fault that first propagated up dip than DE at shallow depth. The earthquake caused surface ruptures characterized by westward dipping normal-fault scarps mapped along several segments of the Itozawa, Yunodake and Shionohira faults with average dip direction\/dip angle of 260\/70, and 2\u00a0m maximum displacement (Otsubo et al., 2013). The studied area originally had two faults mapped: the Yunodake fault and a few lineaments grouped together as the Itozawa fault. Both faults were interpreted to be potentially active without discernible slip sense (Research Group on Active Faults of Japan, 1991; Nakata and Imaizumi, 2002). Fukushima-ken Hamadori Earthquake of Mw 6.7 occurred on April 11, 2011, just 1 month after the Tohoku-oki Earthquake of Mw 9.0. Co-seismic surface ruptures appeared approximately 14\u00a0km along a part of the western section of NNW-SSE trending Itozawa fault and 15\u00a0km along the NW-SE trending Yunodake fault (shown in red colour in Fig. 1). Faint slips were recognized on the eastern section of the NNW-SSE trending Itozawa fault, but no rupture exposed along the southern section of N-S trending Itozawa fault. After the earthquake, Itozawa fault was recognized to be composed of three distinct sections based on aerial photograph interpretation: eastern, western and southern sections (Toda and Tsutsumi, 2013). The NNW-SSE trending eastern section (Itozawa fault (East) in Fig. 1) is straight and continuous from Koedai to Narusaku. The western section, extending from Tsunagi to Sakura, is parallel to the eastern section. The N-S trending southern section branches from the eastern section at Sakura and extends southward to Fujioka. The surface ruptured part from Tsunagi to Nameishi of the western section of Itozawa fault was newly named the Shionohira fault (Ishiyama et al., 2011). Shionohira test site is located on the activated Shionohira fault, while Minakami-kita test site is located across the inactivated Itozawa fault (South). The causes of faults activation might be related to changes in the stress state following the Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Kato et al., 2011). Here, we explore if differences in fault hydromechanical properties may explain that some fault segments were activated and ruptured the land surface while others remained inactive although being very close and aligned on the same fault zone.\nIn 2018 and 2019, we conducted hydraulic tests in shallow 20\u201330\u00a0m deep boreholes cross-cutting one activated of the Shionohira fault and one inactivated segment of the Itozawa fault (South), respectively at the Shionohira and at the Minakami-kita sites (Fig. 1). A borehole probe developed by LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, US) was deployed, and the Step Rate Injection Method for Fracture InSitu Properties (SIMFIP, Guglielmi et al., 2014) was applied in borehole sealed-sections set across the fault zone. Basically, the key idea of the SIMFIP tests is to pressurize the fault zone in an interval isolated by inflatable packers until a micro-to-millimeter scale fault movement is triggered. We report here the first application of this instrument to the in situ hydromechanical characterization of a recently ruptured active fault in a shallow stress field environment. We first describe the experimental setting and the measured fault three-dimensional displacements and pore pressure variations during the tests. We then conduct a three-dimensional forward analysis of the fault hydromechanical response to explore the different parameters driving this local fault reactivation mechanism, including an estimate of the amount of shear slip triggered on the fault. We then use a one-dimensional inverse analysis of the slip events to evaluate the fault frictional dependency on slip velocity. Finally, we discuss how this new in situ testing protocol can help identifying differences in hydro-mechanical properties and in rupture mechanisms between an activated and un-activated fault segment, and better assessing the effects of fault surface rupture related to seismic events on the safety of human structures in Japan and in other countries.\n\n\n2\nExperimental setting\n\n2.1\nSIMFIP protocol for fault reactivation by fluid injection\nThe instrument used for the fault zone isolation is a double-packer probe instrumented with a high-resolution fiber-optic three-dimensional displacement borehole sensor and a fluid pressure sensor (Guglielmi et al., 2014 and Fig. 2\n). The SIMFIP method relies on hydraulic tests performed in boreholes with the probe. It has been deployed in several research experiments set in Underground Research Laboratories (URL) worldwide (Guglielmi et al., 2015a, 2015b). Since 2017, LBNL has developed different versions of the SIMFIP probes that allow testing different fault thickness (up to ~5\u00a0m), soft and\/or hard rock materials and at increased pressure\/depth conditions up to 40\u00a0MPa. In this study, the SIMFIP three-dimensional displacement sensor which is a 0.2\u00a0m long and 0.1\u00a0m diameter pre-calibrated aluminum cage is integrated in the mandrel straddling the two 1\u00a0m long probe's inflatable rubber packers which are sliding sleeves (Fig. 2a). The packers play two roles, respectively, sealing the test interval in the borehole and anchoring the displacement sensor. When water pressure is increased in the sealed zone and the fault starts moving, the SIMFIP sensor monitors the displacement of the upper packer relative to the lower packer (Fig. 2b). The aluminum cage is instrumented with 6 strain measurements performed with optical Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) that are mechanically clamped on the 6 wings of the deforming cage (numbers 1\u20136 in Fig. 2c). Each FBG gage (Fig. 2d) measures the cage's strain in one uniaxial direction. Thus, the cage allows for 6 different uniaxial strain directions to be continuously monitored at high-frequency (~0.5\u00a0kHz) during the test. In addition, there is a reference FBG subject to ambient pressure and temperature which remains unstressed (number 7 in Fig. 2c). All the FBG are distributed along one single fiber that brings the sensor signals to a MicronOptics Si155 acquisition system set at the ground surface. This interrogator allows picking shifts in the FBG wavelength that relate to FBG deformation over a large spectrum of FBG wavelengths. The 6 components of the tensor describing the relative displacement and rotation between the top and bottom of the cage are calculated as a linear function of the 6 strain components.\nThe sequence of operation consists of the following steps. First, the fault zone is sealed in an open hole using the two inflatable rubber packers. The probe was adapted to each borehole-fault intersection geometry, the longer the intersection's length the longer the distance between the probe's packers (Fig. 3\n). Thus, the distance between packers is longer in Shinohira (Fig. 3a, b) compared to Minakami-kita (Fig. 3c, d), respectively of 4.5 and 1.95\u00a0m. Second, a series of fluid injections either at controlled constant pressure or constant flow rate are conducted. The key idea is to progressively bring the fault to rupture by a step-by-step decrease of the effective normal stress clamping the fault (Guglielmi et al., 2014). When the fault is at rupture according to the Mohr-Coulomb failure concept, injection is maintained long enough to capture a significant amount of fault movement that can be used to characterize fault frictional and overall hydromechanical mechanism of reactivation.\nEarly injection cycles are meant to track early rupture initiation at the borehole wall but they may not represent well the fault rupture. Indeed, how a rupture initiates depends on borehole stress concentration with respect to the in-situ stresses, fluid viscosity, injection rate and the geometry of the borehole wall defects due to the geology and to the drilling (Lecampion et al., 2017). In addition, the injection pressure response to fracture initiation is often \u201chidden\u201d by viscous effects associated to the borehole pressurization protocol and the fluid penetration in the created fracture. The early injection cycles are repeated until a clear breakdown pressure, which is the maximum pressure reached during the test, is reached and associated to pressurized flow forcing its way into the fault. After a few cycles of constant pressure steps, we switch to constant flow injection steps to propagate the rupture in the fault far enough from the injection borehole nearfield influence. One way to control the size of the fault reactivation patch is to track the water pressure variation which is occurring when there is a hydraulic connection with a monitoring borehole set several meters away from the injection hole.\nWhen the fault rupture is activated, the cage captures micrometer to millimeter three-dimensional displacements of the borehole that occur between the upper and the lower packers. The maximum displacement range of the SIMFIP is 0.7 and 3.5\u00a0mm in the axial and radial directions of the borehole, respectively, and the accuracy is \u00b110\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0m. A compass set on the probe provides the orientation of measurements with 0.1\u00b0 accuracy. The stimulation pressure and injected flowrate are simultaneously measured during the test with precision of 104\u00a0Pa and 0.1\u00a0l\/min, respectively downhole (point 4 in Fig. 2a) and at the ground surface. SIMFIP tests inform on:\n\n\u2022\nThe fault activation pressure which is the pressure value when injection pressure starts dropping at constant injection rate;\n\n\n\u2022\nThe mode of activation which is deduced from the orientation of the measured displacement versus the fault surface orientation;\n\n\n\u2022\nThe irreversible displacement produced by the test which is the displacement value at the end of the test when borehole pressure has returned to its initial pre-test value.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nFault surface rupture at Shionohira test site\nAt the Shionohira site, the surface rupture related to the 04\/11\/2011 earthquake is characterized by a\u00a0~\u00a02\u00a0m high scarp with a dip direction\/dip angle of 270\u00b0\/74\u00b0. The fault scarp is cutting a small valley almost perpendicularly. The scarp bars the course of the small stream creating a pond (Fig. 4a). The fault eastern compartment is made of schists. The fault western compartment is made of gravels overlying sandstones. Outcrop observation revealed a principal shear zone (PSZ) with smooth surfaces and a thin fault gouge (Seshimo et al., 2015). In the eastern compartment, a fault fracture damage zone (FDZ) is affecting schist over several meters. In the western compartment, a meter thick FDZ is affecting the sandstones. Observation of polished slabs and thin sections sampled from the outcrop revealed normal faults in the western compartment's FDZ, and both normal (with a left-lateral component) and reverse faults in the eastern compartment.\nTwo fully cored vertical boreholes, 3\u00a0m horizontally spaced have been drilled about 6.0\u20136.8\u00a0m away from the fault scarp (Fig. 4b). Boreholes initiate in the fault western compartment made of intact sandstones overlaid by 7.0\u00a0m thick alluvial deposits (Fig. 4b). The sandstones contain conglomerate lenses and some bedding surfaces characterized by a variable 296\u00b0\u2013350\u00b0\/6\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 orientation. The injection hole which is 30\u00a0m deep, is intersecting the fault zone at a depth of 14.4\u00a0m close to a complex tectono-sedimentary transition zone between conglomerates and crystalline schists (Fig. 4b). The PSZ has been intersected between 15.0 and 15.8\u00a0m depth (Fig. 3a). It is made of fine-grained material resulting from the comminution of schists during the fault movement. This material is affected by 249\u00b0\/69\u201372\u00b0 oriented slip surfaces. Below 15.8\u00a0m, the borehole is cross-cutting an older fault zone, that was not reactivated during the 2011 earthquake rupture. Down to about 24\u00a0m, the fault material looks almost similar, characterized by fine-to-relatively-coarse clasts with some apparent cements figured as white deposits. Caliper logs done a few days before starting the tests showed three significant borehole enlargements (washout), respectively between [14\u201315.8\u00a0m], [18\u201319\u00a0m] and [20\u201321\u00a0m] that resulted from the collapse of highly unconsolidated fine-grained shear layers. Below 24\u00a0m the schist looks much less brecciated. It corresponds to the fault fractured damaged zone down to the bottom of the borehole. The 28.6\u00a0m deep monitoring hole which is 3.1\u00a0m away from the injection hole displays the same geology. In that borehole, the activated PSZ is intersected between 15.94 and 16.6\u00a0m depth, and oriented 235\u00b0\/76\u00b0\u201378\u00b0.\nThree SIMFIP tests were completed in the injection borehole (Fig. 4b), respectively at [7\u201311.5\u00a0m] in the intact sandstone, at [12.8\u201317.3\u00a0m] across the activated PSZ and at [16.4\u201323.5\u00a0m] in the old inactive fault zone. Shear activation was only measured in the [12.8\u201317.3\u00a0m] interval set across the activated PSZ while mostly reversible re-opening of existing planes was detected in the other intervals, bedding planes in the sandstone and steeply dipping fractures in the old inactive fault zone. The amount of irreversible displacement was 10\u2013100 times larger in the activated PSZ interval than in the other intervals while the activation pressure was equal to 5\u20137 times smaller (Table 1\n). These direct in situ observations show that the recently activated PSZ is the weakest zone intersected by the boreholes. In the following, we will focus on the analyses of fault movements triggered by injections in the [12.8\u201317.3\u00a0m] interval set across the activated PSZ (Fig. 3a and Table 1).\n\n\n2.3\nMinakami-kita test site\nThe Minakami-kita site is located across the inactive southern section of Itozawa fault (Itozawa fault (South) in Fig. 1). No surface rupture was observed after the 04\/11\/2011 earthquake (Figs. 1 and 4c). Two 50\u00b0 inclined fully cored boreholes were drilled eastward from the surface with a 30\u00a0m length and a 3.7\u00a0m horizontal spacing (Fig. 4d, note that, in the following text, distance values correspond to the distance from the well head). The fault principal shear zone (PSZ) was detected at 20.40\u201323.10\u00a0m where a significant borehole enlargement corresponds to an ultrafine-grain shear zone with a dip direction\/dip angle of 281\u2013285\u00b0\/67\u201380\u00b0 (Fig. 3c). There is an apparent ~10\u201320\u00a0m normal fault offset (Fig. 4d). Indeed, the western fault compartment is characterized by a\u00a0~\u00a010\u201320\u00a0m thick pile of tertiary detritic and poorly cohesive sediments overlying crystalline schist, while the eastern compartment is only made of crystalline schist. The contact between tertiary sediments and schists is observed at 19.8\u00a0m in the injection borehole. From 18.7\u00a0m to the PSZ, the rock is strongly altered and affected by fracture planes parallel to the average fault direction. It corresponds to 1.5\u00a0m thick western fault damage zone. In the eastern compartment, the schist is fractured down to the bottom of the borehole at 30.0\u00a0m. It could correspond to a\u00a0~\u00a07 to 8\u00a0m thick eastern fault damage zone.\nFour SIMFIP tests were completed in the injection borehole (Table 1), respectively at [17.85\u201319.8\u00a0m] mainly in the western fault damage zone including the contact with sedimentary rocks, [19.75\u201321.7\u00a0m] and [21.65\u201323.6\u00a0m] respectively across the top and bottom of the fault PSZ, and [23.29\u201325.24\u00a0m] in the eastern fault damage zone. Clear fault irreversible displacements have been observed in [19.75\u201321.7\u00a0m] and [21.65\u201323.6\u00a0m] intervals set across the fault PSZ. These two intervals display a roughly similar irreversible 270\u2013321\u00b0\/12\u201325\u00b0 fault displacement, and 70\u2013160\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0m of irreversible shear displacement (Table 1). The orientation of displacements is different. It is dipping South-East in [19.75\u201321.7\u00a0m] and North-West in [21.65\u201323.6\u00a0m] intervals. The reason is that the activated fault was outside the SIMFIP anchors\/packers in [19.75\u201321.7\u00a0m], producing an apparent contraction on the SIMFIP. This was caused by a leak between the injection interval and the bottom hole zone that occurred through the formation. We can reasonably consider that the same shear zone located at 22.9\u00a0m and oriented 280\u2013287\/67\u201380 was activated with a significant borehole shear movement. No irreversible displacement was measured in the two fault damage zones [17.85\u201319.8] and [23.29\u201325.24] intervals, highlighting that no fault activation was triggered. The breakout pressures to activate fluid leakage in the fault were of 10.1\u201311 bars, respectively in [19.75\u201321.7\u00a0m] and [21.65\u201323.6\u00a0m] fault core intervals. In the [17.85\u201319.8\u00a0m] interval, pressure could not be increased because of the very high initial leakage in the formation. In the [23.29\u201325.24\u00a0m] interval, no leakage was observed even at a 17 bars maximum injection pressure.\nThese direct in situ observations show that the [21.65\u201323.6\u00a0m] interval, including the PSZ, is the weakest zone intersected by the boreholes. In the following, we will focus on fault movements triggered by injections in this interval (Table 1).\n\n\n\n3\nField measurements during the hydraulic tests\n\n3.1\nSelected tests and Injection sequence\nIn this chapter, we compare fault movements triggered by injections conducted at both the Shionohira and the Minakami-kita sites using tests done in the following intervals (Table 1):\n\n\u2022\nthe [12.8\u201317.3\u00a0m] interval set across the PSZ of the Shionohira fault that was activated by the Fukushima-ken Hamadori Earthquake (Shinohira site);\n\n\n\u2022\nthe [21.65\u201323.6\u00a0m] interval set across the PSZ of the inactive southern section of Itozawa fault (Minakami-kita site).\n\n\n\nBoth intervals were recognized as the weakest zones intersected by the injection boreholes. They both include the principal shear zone (PSZ) of the fault.\nIn both sites, the injection sequence is the same. It is characterized by two contrasted testing periods (Fig. 5\n). Taking the example of the Shionohira site test sequence (Fig. 5a), we first injected a small water volume of 6.4\u00a0l using a manual pump in order to initiate the fault reactivation at the borehole wall during the [11:25\u201312:12] period. Each manual pump stroke was 1-s-long and corresponds to 15\u00a0ml of injected water. Pressure was increased step-by-step by increments of 0.5\u00a0bar. After each pressure step, the pumping was stopped for about 2\u00a0min.\nSecond, during the [13:21\u201315:06] period, a large water volume of 1.53\u00a0m3 was injected with an engine pump in order to extend the size of the rupture patch in the activated fault, significantly away from the injection borehole influence. The flow rate was increased step-by-step from 7.6\u201350.1\u00a0l\/min, at each step the flowrate being hold constant for ~1.5\u00a0min.\n\n\n3.2\nShinohira [12.8\u201317.3\u00a0m] interval across the activated PSZ\nDuring the [11:25\u201312:12] period, rupture initiates between 2.6 and 3.8 bars, and is associated to a pressure drop (that occurs after the pumping was stopped at the given pressures, Fig. 5a).\nDuring the [13:21\u201315:06] period, the ruptured patch produced by the [11:25\u201312:12] period was hydraulically re-opened during the first applied flow step of 7.6\u00a0l\/min (Fig. 5a and 6a). In Fig. 6a, chamber pressure reached 4.76 bars after 24\u00a0s of injection, before decreasing to an almost constant value of 3.8 bars towards the end of this initial 7.6\u00a0l\/min step (Fig. 6a, point 1 at 2\u00a0min and 4\u00a0s). The onset of the pressure decrease corresponds to the fault hydraulic opening pressure (FOP in Fig. 6a). Then, pressure stayed roughly constant at about 3.8 bars during the following flow step increases from 7.6 to 50.1\u00a0l\/min (Fig. 6a). In details, there is a pressure increase occurring at each flow rate increase. Then, after pumping is stopped, there is a pressure decrease to ~3.8 bars. This is happening at each flow step from 7.6 up to 50.1\u00a0l\/min. When flow rate is stepped down at 33\u00a0min and 39\u00a0s (point 5 in Fig. 6a), there is a corresponding pressure step down, back to the initial interval pressure. Fig. 6b and c show that both the monitoring borehole located 3\u00a0m away and the pressure in the hanging wall sandstones (which is measured in the injection well above the upper packer) reach a constant value after 6\u00a0min and 39\u00a0s and 8\u00a0min and 22\u00a0s of injection, respectively (Fig. 6 points 2 and 3). This means that at this time water is outflowing at both borehole heads. Meanwhile, a very small pressure variation is observed below the sealed section in the injection well, occurring during the first steps and related to the lower packer mechanical response to pressurization in the interval (Fig. 6b). Finally, a 1.1\u00a0l\/min outflow is observed at the ground surface (outflow was estimated using a 10\u00a0l bucket), 4\u00a0m away from the injection well and after 22\u00a0min and 53\u00a0s of injection (Fig. 6 point 4 and Fig. 4b for location). These observations display the following information:\n\n\u2022\nLeakage occurred in the permeable sandstones,\n\n\n\u2022\nNo leakage was observed in the metamorphic footwall,\n\n\n\u2022\nThe fault pressurized patch radius was of ~10\u201320\u00a0m (if we consider the distance between the injection interval and the outflow at land surface as a rough estimation of the patch radius, Fig. 4b),\n\n\n\u2022\nGround surface acted as a hydrogeological constant pressure boundary during the test.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 7a shows that the three-dimensional borehole displacements variations during the [13:21\u201315:06] period are characterized by three successive phases:\n\n\u2022\nInitial fracture hydraulic re-opening phase (black segment in Fig. 7). The fracture reopening phase corresponds to the first 2\u00a0min and 4\u00a0s of injection including the FOP and \u201cending\u201d at point 1 in Fig. 6a. When applying the first step of 7.6\u00a0l\/min constant flowrate during this period, a horizontal EW displacement is first observed before FOP (Fig. 7b). This initial displacement is related to the borehole wall elastic response to pressurization before leakage occurs into the fault. At FOP and until point 1, a vertical displacement initiates (see FOP-to-point 1 segment in Fig. 7b) in addition to a re-orientation of the horizontal displacement parallel to the fault's strike (Fig. 7c). As soon as the vertical displacement initiates, there is a pressure decay (see FOP to point 1 segment in Fig. 6a) showing that the fault is hydraulically opening. Synchronously, displacement progressive re-orientation parallel to the fault's strike highlights that the fault starts shearing (Fig. 7c).\n\n\n\u2022\nPropagation of fault rupture (red segment in Fig. 7). The fault rupture propagation corresponds to the period from point 1 to the onset of the pressure step down at point 5 in Fig. 6. When flowrate is increased step-by-step, displacement orientates almost parallel to the fault's strike (Fig. 7c), corresponding to a left-lateral strike slip movement with a reverse component (meaning that the fault western compartment is moving upwards and southwards along the fault surface compared to the fault eastern compartment which is moving downwards and northwards, Fig. 7). Fig. 7d shows the stereographic projection of the displacement vector \n\n15\n\u2192\n\n that is calculated between the displacements measured at points 1 and 5 bounding the rupture propagation period (red segment in Fig. 7). It results that rupture propagation away from the borehole influence is characterized by a borehole displacement dip direction\/dip angle of 320\u00b0\/15\u00b0. This vector is consistent with the opening of the fault, the two walls of the fault PSZ moving away from each other along a direction perpendicular to the fault PSZ, associated to the reverse shearing of the fault, the western compartment moving up along the dip of the 249\u00b0\/69\u201372\u00b0 PSZ straddled by the probe in the injection interval (Fig. 7d).\n\n\n\u2022\nFault closing during pressure step-down (green segment in the Fig. 7). When flowrate is step-decreased (after point 5 in Fig. 6a), there is a vertical contraction of the borehole with a horizontal component oriented as the initial pre-FOP displacement. The residual displacement observed at the end of the test matches with the inelastic fault slip period that occurred during rupture propagation (compare for example the distance between the beginning and the end of the test, and the length of the red segment in the Fig. 7c).\n\n\n\nIn Fig. 8\n, we have isolated the fault tangential displacement periods that occur during the rupture propagation phase (red segment in Fig. 7). In order to avoid the influence of artificial pressure variations when the flowrate is varied from one constant step to the other, we only pick the fault shear and normal opening variations during the constant flowrate periods (colored segments in Fig. 8). There is no clear relationship between fault movements and the injection flowrate. The shear and normal opening during the first flow step display a significantly different shear displacement amplitude and normal opening compared to the following steps (Fig. 8b, c). Since it corresponds to the early fault rupture propagation associated to the reorientation of the displacements parallel to the fault strike, such a difference is interpreted as the influence of some borehole nearfield heterogeneity affecting the rupture patch which is of limited extension at this time of the test. During the following steps, while the patch is extending several meters beyond the influence of the borehole, fault shear roughly displays about the same range of variations. There is a non-linear shear displacement increase with time that is almost symmetrical to the synchronous pressure decay. Except steps 7.6 and 30.6\u00a0l\/min, this is associated to a normal opening. Thus, observations show that when the rupture patch extension is large enough within the fault PSZ, shear induces fault dilation and associated decrease in pressure at constant injection flowrate.\n\n\n3.3\nMinakami-kita [21.65\u201323.6\u00a0m] interval across the inactive PFZ\nAs mentioned in chapter 3.1, the test sequence is similar to the one conducted at the Shionohira site in the way that we first start with manual pump injections and then conduct engine pump injections. The idea is to first initiate rupture and then to propagate it. The test sequence is characterized by four injection periods (Fig. 5b). Compared to tests performed at the Shionohira site, all injection periods were pressure-controlled. It means that the increase in the injection chamber's pressure was conducted by steps of fixed constant pressure until fault activation. At fault activation pressure, the mechanical opening of the fault caused an un-controlled pressure drop (Fig. 5b, seen on all periods) and a sudden increase of the injection flowrate from a null value (Fig. 5b, seen on [15:56\u201316:36] and [16:38\u201316:58] periods which were the only cycles when flowrate was monitored). During [15:22\u201315:41] and [15:43\u201315:54] periods, pressure was increased by injecting small water volumes with a manual pump, respectively of 2.25 and 1.5\u00a0l. No pressure variation was observed above or below the injection interval, and at the monitoring borehole. We switched to an engine pump in order to inject larger volumes in [15:56\u201316:36] and [16:38\u201316:58] periods, in order to extend the rupture in the fault away from the borehole influence. Then, a pressure increase marked the hydraulic connection with the monitoring hole. Given the distance between the two boreholes, it allows estimating that the activated patch had hydraulically extended of at least 3\u00a0m away from the injection hole. Injected volumes during [15:56\u201316:36] and [16:38\u201316:58] periods were of 56.8 and 213.6\u00a0l, respectively. The breakdown pressure decreases from 16.3 to 10.5\u00a0bars from period [15:22\u201315:41] to [16:38\u201316:58], respectively. It highlights that it was easier and easier to open and activate the fault while repeating the pressure cycles.\n\nFig. 9a\u2013d show that, during the [15:22\u201315:41] period, fracture activation initiates with a 270\u00b0\/30\u00b0 borehole displacement, corresponding to an opening of the fault with a downward displacement of the fault western compartment parallel to the borehole axis direction (cyan segment in Fig. 9a\u2013d). Then, there is a significant rotation of the displacement (magenta period in Fig. 9a\u2013d). Fig. 9d is showing the 220\u00b0\/10\u00b0 dip direction\/dip angle vector calculated between displacements at the onset and at the end of the magenta segment. This displacement is consistent with the opening and downward left-lateral shearing of the 285\u00b0\/80\u00b0 PSZ straddled by the probe in the injection interval. When pressure is decreased, borehole displacement trend is roughly the reverse of the initial one (compare black segment orientation with cyan segment in Fig. 9a\u2013c), but with a larger magnitude. At the end of the [15:22\u201315:41] period, there is a\u00a0~\u00a00.2\u00a0mm residual displacement showing that some irreversible fault activation occurred. This irreversible displacement apparently mainly relates to the left lateral shear period (magenta in Fig. 8a\u2013c). Fig. 9e\u2013h show, that during the [15:56\u201316:36] period, the left lateral fault shear is more pronounced. Here, the displacement vector in Fig. 9h is calculated between the onset of the cyan period and the end of the red period. The 223\u00b0\/14\u00b0 dip direction\/dip angle vector corresponds to a similar fault movement as the one deduced from the [15:22\u201315:41] period (compare Fig. 9d and h). Nevertheless, during the shut-in and the interval pressure bleed-off period (respectively magenta and black segments in Fig. 9e\u2013g), it appears that most of this displacement is reversed. At the end of the [15:56\u201316:36] period, the residual displacement is ~0.2\u00a0mm, in the same range as observed after cycle 1. Thus, propagation of rupture from the [15:22\u201315:41] to the [15:56\u201316:36] period is characterized by fault opening and shearing with a cumulated irreversible displacement of ~0.4\u00a0mm and a reversible displacement of ~0.5 to 0.6\u00a0mm mainly observed in periods [15:22\u201315:41, 15:56\u201316:36]. Most of the last [16:38\u201316:58] period induced reversible displacement.\n\nFig. 10a\u2013c shows that, during the [15:22\u201315:41] period, rupture initiates during the maximum pressure increase (cyan segment in Fig. 10a) with about the same amount of shear and normal opening on the fault. This is thus corresponding to a highly dilatant event. Same thing occurs when pressure is artificially increased again, but this second time there is more shearing than fault normal opening (magenta segment in Fig. 10a). The red segment that is observed between the two pressure activation events (cyan and magenta in Fig. 10a) shows shear increasing while there is a slight fault normal closing. This might be explained by pressure diffusing into the activated zone that favors fault shear and associated dilation. Dilation increases fault leakage and pressure decrease since no flow is injected in the interval to maintain the pressure constant during this period of time. The apparent overclosure and shear at the end of the period is related to the complex three-dimensional movement of the borehole relative to the fault as shown in Fig. 9a\u2013c. During the [15:56\u201316:36] period (Fig. 10d\u2013f), there is a highly non-linear fault re-opening and shear characterized by cyan and red segments. First, fault re-opens and re-shears at high pressure of 10.7\u00a0bar but with no significant variation in flowrate (cyan segment). Then, rupture growth initiates after a new attempt to artificially increase pressure (red segment), with an increase in both opening and shear. This is associated to a significant increase in flowrate. When the injection chamber is shut-in (magenta segment in Fig. 10d), there is a slow negative shear and normal closing of the fault. This trend continues even after the chamber bleed-off. At bleed-off, a transient pressure increase is observed associated to mainly reversible shear and normal displacement of the fault. This transient may correspond to flow back from the activated patch into the borehole (although this could not be measured during the test), indirectly informing that a relatively little leakage from the ruptured patch into the surrounding rock may have occurred.\n\n\n\n4\nThree-dimensional numerical analyses of faults hydromechanical activation\n\n4.1\nModel set-up\nThe 3DEC distinct element code (Itasca Consulting Group, 2016) is used to represent a fault in a three-dimensional model of about 20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0m (Fig. 11\n). Fault orientation is 249\u00b0\/69\u00b0 and 285\u00b0\/80\u00b0 at Shinohira and Minakami-kita sites, respectively (Fig. 11a and d). At Shinohira, the fault scarp affecting the topography after the 04\/11\/2011 earthquake is represented.\nThe fault is modeled as a thin planar interface separating two compartments represented as two elastically deformable and hydraulically permeable blocks that are free to move, rotate and separate relative to one another. In addition, water leakage between the fault plane and the blocks is allowed. Flow in the blocks follows the Darcy law. The fault plane is divided into 0.2 to 0.6\u00a0m mesh elements that represents contacts between the two deformable blocks. At each time step, the laws of motion and constitutive equations are jointly applied to calculate normal and shear forces at each contact, which then are used in the calculation of the block motion using a time-domain dynamic algorithm. The fault constitutive model is the generalization of the Coulomb friction law. We use two Mohr-Coulomb models, a constant friction and a linear slip-weakening friction model. The linear slip-weakening law assumes that the friction coefficient (\u03bc) depends on the amount of slip (D) and decays linearly from a peak static value (\u03bcs) to a residual dynamic value (\u03bcd) over a critical slip distance (\u03b4c, and Eq. (1)):\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bc\n=\n{\n\n\u03bc\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u03bc\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bc\nd\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\u03b4\nc\n\n\n\nD\n<\n\n\u03b4\nc\n\n\n\n\u03bc\nd\n\n\nD\n>\n\n\u03b4\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, following the concept developed in Guglielmi et al. (2020), our model allows for fluid flow only through the ruptured (either in shear or tension) parts of the predefined fault plane. This is justified by no observed injection flow when a low injection pressure was applied in the test zones, highlighting an initial fault aperture close to zero (Fig. 5). Thus, the fluid has to force its way into ruptured area of the fault. In the model, the injection is applied in one contact element in the middle of the fault plane. Outside of this element, contacts must rupture for the fluid flow to occur within the fault plane. When a plane element is ruptured, fluid flow is calculated using the modified cubic law (Witherspoon et al., 1980), where the hydraulic aperture is dependent on the fracture deformation (opening and shear-induced dilation) to account for the stress-dependent fracture hydraulic conductivity (Detournay, 1980).\nThe two models were initially consolidated under gravity force, with null velocity boundaries applied perpendicularly on the four vertical sides and on the bottom side of the model. The top side of the model was set free to move because it corresponds to the topographic surface. In the Shionohira model, the upper 5\u00a0m of the south side were also set free to move in order to represent the influence of the nearby valley on model stresses (Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, both models oversimplify the local topography which might play complex effects on the stress distribution around the faults. In both models, a groundwater table was set at 3.5 and 6.5\u00a0m depths in Shionohira and in Minakami-kita, respectively. Hydraulic and mechanical properties found in the bibliography (Kuwahara et al., 1991) were assigned to faults and surrounding rocks, and adjusted after matching the calculated fault fluid pressure and mechanical displacements to the field measured ones (Table 2\n).\nWith this numerical modeling approach, we do not attempt to make an exact match of simulated and experimental data. The observed discrepancy is related to the simple homogeneous properties assigned to the fault and to the intact rock, the schematic fault zone geometry, and the simplified overall site hydrogeological context (the topographic surface is poorly figured as an example). We rather try to obtain a reasonable agreement to the general evolution of pressure and displacement data in order to explore the mechanisms of activation and inactivation of the two explored fault segments. Consequently, we focus on modeling the key test periods described in Section 3, the second [13:21\u201315:06] period of Shionohira test sequence and the [15:22\u201315:41, 15:56\u201316:36] periods of Minakami test sequence. All model cases are summarized in Table 2. In the Shionohira case, our baseline model 1 (i.e the \u00abbest\u00bb match to the experimental data, Table 2) is considering that a high permeability of the sandstone conglomerates controls leakage in the fault hanging-wall, and influences fault displacements and pore pressure. We then conduct models 2, 3 and 4 where we respectively vary the hanging-wall permeability, the fault friction and stiffness (Table 2). Finally, we consider the possibility for the fault friction to decrease with fault slip (slip-weakening model 5). In the Minakami case, we use the [15:22\u201315:41] period to match a best fit case (model 1, Table 2) for fracture initiation and we conduct a sensitivity study by varying fault friction, fault cohesion and the normal stress applied on the fault (models 2-3-4, Table 2). Then we use model 1 properties to analyze the [15:56\u201316:36] period where our stimulated fault volume grows away from the injection borehole. We explore what may explain the differences with the first activation period by considering a lower friction of the fault (model 5), a more complex fault structure (model 6) and a complex interaction between a newly formed fluid driven fracture and the natural fault (model 7).\n\n\n4.2\nEstimations of the in-situ stress tensor\nIn Fig. 11 and Table 3\n, we compare the state of stress calculated on the fault planes after the hydromechanical consolidation of the forward model under gravity, using the rock properties listed in Table 2, with an inverse approach based on a fault dislocation analysis during fluid injection (Kakurina et al., 2019, 2020). First, we consider the orientation of the slip component of the measured SIMFIP displacement vector (Figs. 7d, 9d\u2013h and Table 3). A slip direction is calculated on the fault plane considering the hypothesis that slip is consistent with the direction of the resolved shear stress on the plane (Wallace, 1951; Bott, 1959). We search for all possible reduced stress tensor solutions that fit the measured slip. The slip direction is calculated using the reduced stress tensor defined over a computational mesh of 59,400 grid points with 300 directions of \u03c33 with nearly equal intervals, 18 directions of \u03c31 for each \u03c33 with an interval of 10\u00b0, and 11 variations of stress ratio R with an increment of 0.1 for each combination of \u03c31 and \u03c33, following the approach developed by Yamaji (2003). To maximize the fit of the assumed stresses from the grid to the observed data, we use the objective function recommended by Angelier (1979) which depends on both the direction and sense of the fault motion. To reduce the number of possible solutions, we keep the reduced stress tensors with a maximum misfit angle between the calculated and measured slip of 5\u00b0. Second, we estimate the absolute principal stress magnitudes \u03c31, \u03c32, \u03c33 by solving the system of equations below:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n3\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n3\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n=\n\nl\n1\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n1\n\n+\n\nm\n1\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n2\n\n+\n\nn\n1\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n=\n\nl\n2\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n1\n\n+\n\nm\n2\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n2\n\n+\n\nn\n2\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere l\n1, m\n1, n\n1 and l\n2, m\n2, n\n2 are the direction cosines of the normal and vertical components of the fracture with respect to the principal stress axes. R is the reduced stress tensor. \u03c3v is the vertical stress. \u03c3n is the fracture normal stress. For the Shinohira and Minakami tests, the vertical stress was estimated by the weight of the overburden considering a 1900 and 2800\u00a0kg\/m3 density respectively (Table 2). In the Shionohira inversion, we approximate \u03c3n to the injection pressure of 3.8\u00a0bar corresponding to the average value of the 2.8 to 4.8\u00a0bar pressures measured at fault opening during the [11:25\u201312:12] injection cycle (Fig. 5a). Since some slip may have initiated as well as fault opening, this is certainly a rough estimation of \u03c3n. In the Minakami inversion, we approximate \u03c3n to the pressure of 6.8 bars measured at the end of the [15:56\u201316:36] cycle shut-in period (Fig. 5b). We finally get several possible reduced stress tensor solutions (colored dots in Fig. 11b\u2013e), with the median stress tensor solution having about the same orientation in both sites (black crosses in Fig. 11b\u2013e). It is characterized by a sub-vertical \u03c33 certainly explained by the shallowness of the tests. \u03c31 and \u03c32 respectively are sub-horizontal, and respectively EW and NS oriented. These directions have no clear correlation with the ones deduced from the focal mechanism of the Fukushima-Hamadori earthquake at depth (Yoshida et al., 2015), and we know no shallow stress measurement performed in the area after the earthquake. In addition, the magnitudes of all three principal stresses are very close to each other, highlighting a relatively isotropic in-situ state of stress. Black circular dots in Fig. 11c\u2013f and Table 3 show that the stress tensor magnitudes derived from the 3DEC model match reasonably well with the tensor estimated from the inversion of the fault displacement. We thus estimate that the fault reactivations observed in the field were performed at such a shallow depth that activation modes are much more related to fault properties and orientation than to the in-situ stress tensor in such tests. This comparative approach also allows us \u201cvalidating\u201d the boundary conditions applied in the numerical model that restitutes stress magnitudes and orientation in reasonable accordance with the inverse approach.\nWe then applied the hydraulic injection protocol conducted in the field, respectively the flow-controlled engine pump injection during the [13:21\u201315:06] period at Shionohira and the pressure-controlled [15:22\u201315:41, 15:56\u201316:36] injection periods at Minakami-kita (Fig. 5).\n\n\n4.3\nShionohira fault hydromechanical response\n\nFig. 12a, b shows the calculated pressure in the Shionohira fault for different model parameters, during the first step of 7.6\u00a0l\/min constant flowrate. The model 1 is reproducing reasonably well the injection and the monitoring pressure variations when (1) a high permeable hanging wall (fault western compartment) of 10\u221210\u00a0m2 is considered to figure the high permeability of the sedimentary layers compared to the footwall (eastern compartment) metamorphic rocks, and the fault is affected (2) a 14\u00b0 constant friction angle and (3) a 12\u00a0GPa\/m elastic stiffness (Table 2). When no high permeable sedimentary deposits are considered, there is an overestimation of the calculated pressures because pressure cannot be dissipated by leakage into the sedimentary deposits (model 2, Fig. 12 and Table 2) In that case, we observe three slightly different fault hydromechanical responses:\n\n\u2022\nModel 3 - A low constant friction angle of 10\u00b0 still overestimates the pressure because it favors a slip patch rather than a large opening patch propagation in the fault. The slip favored on the weak fault induces dilation that progressively dissipates part of the pressure.\n\n\n\u2022\nModel 4 - A high fault elastic stiffness of 18\u00a0GPa\/m limits the initial fault normal opening, showing a large over estimation of injection pressure.\n\n\n\u2022\nModel 5 - A slip-weakening friction from an initial peak friction of 18\u00b0 shows about the same pressure variation that the constant friction fault. This is explained by the fact that most of the friction decrease occurs during the first 10\u00a0s of water injection. After 10\u00a0s, the friction tends to a residual friction of 13.8\u00b0 which is close to the low constant 14\u00b0 friction case, resulting in about the same fault hydromechanical response. To our opinion, this could show that fault remained relatively close to its residual frictional strength and that no friction recovery occurred after the activation by the 2011 Mw 6.7 Fukushima-ken Hamadori earthquake.\n\n\n\nIn Fig. 12c, d, we compare the calculated fault normal and shear displacements with the ones isolated in the field during the rupture propagation phase, outside the artificial flowrate increase periods (colored segments in Fig. 8). Both constant friction models and the slip-weakening model underestimate the slip measured during the first flow step, and much better match with the slip captured during the following flow steps. The fact that models do not reproduce that first experimental flow step might confirm that the measured signal during this step is influenced by some borehole nearfield complexity that is not considered in the models. Indeed, the model figures the fault as a single discontinuity while borehole observations show that the fault is a thick and complex zone (Fig. 3). During the first cycle, failure may nucleate on some local heterogeneity within the fault zone before organizing along the average fault orientation during the following cycles. Another possibility is that during the first cycle, fault activation mechanism is not pure shear failure. Indeed, Fig. 7 shows that during this cycle, the fault displacement contains a significant component perpendicular to the average fault plane orientation.\nA low fault normal opening is calculated in the range of the field measurements during the first 100\u00a0s (Fig. 12c). Model 1 with a 10\u221210\u00a0m2 hanging wall permeability best fit with the field measurements captured during the following flow steps. The non-linear slip increase with time is reasonably well reproduced (Fig. 12d). Model 3 with the 10\u00b0 constant friction angle model and the frictional weakening model 5 overestimate the slip during the first 100\u00a0s. The high 18\u00a0GPa\/m elastic stiffness model 4 overestimates both the normal opening and the fault slip. This is because the higher injection pressure that is required to open the fault is inducing a larger effective normal stress decrease than in the other cases. The result is that, once activated, the fault is opening and slipping significantly more.\n\n\n4.4\nItozawa fault (south) hydromechanical response\n\nFig. 13\n shows that the initiation of the Itozawa fault (South) re-activation during the [15:22\u201315:41] injection cycle is best reproduced for a set of model parameters including (1) a normal stress on the fault that does not exceed 0.2\u00a0MPa, (2) a friction angle of 19\u00b0 and (3) a cohesion of 0.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0Pa (red curve corresponding to model 1, Fig. 13a and Table 2). At 700\u00a0s, when pressure is increased from 14.1 to 16.3\u00a0bar, the model displays a significant increase in fault normal opening to a peak value of the same amplitude as the amount of shear increase. This is followed by an injection pressure decay and a normal closing of the fault while there is no shear displacement. If it reproduces well the pressure at which fault is activated and the general shape of the pressure-displacement signals, the model overestimates the amplitude of the normal displacement peak and the following decay in both pressure and displacement, and it underestimates the amount of shear displacement. At 800\u00a0s, pressure is again artificially increased to 15.6\u00a0bar, producing the same pressure and displacement response of the fault. In this second fault activation step, there is less overestimation of the normal displacement peak and a much better fit of the injection pressure and the shear displacement variation. Overall, the model 1 restitutes reasonably well the two highly dilatant shear events triggered by two injection pressure increases above 14.1 bars (Fig. 13).\nIf the normal stress is increased above 0.2\u00a0MPa, there is no rupture, and no associated injection pressure drop (magenta curve corresponding to model 2, Fig. 13 and Table 2) unless the fault is affected a cohesion of 0\u00a0Pa (cyan curve corresponding to model 3, Fig. 13 and Table 2). In that case, the shear displacement is nevertheless highly underestimated, and horizontal minimum and maximum stresses must be set to high and unrealistic values equal to higher than the vertical stress, with \u03c3h\u00a0=\u00a00.65\u00a0MPa, \u03c3H\u00a0=\u00a00.7\u00a0MPa and \u03c3v\u00a0=\u00a06.8\u00a0MPa. If the normal stress does not exceed 0.2\u00a0MPa, a slight decrease in the friction angle from 19\u00b0 to 18\u00b0 increases the amount of shear (dark blue dashed curve corresponding to model 4, Fig. 13 and Table 2).\nWe used the same best fit fault properties from model 1, to model the cycle [15:56\u201316:36] where a constant pressure step injection was conducted with an engine pump, inducing a hydraulic connection with the monitoring borehole (Fig. 14\n). There is a reasonable match of the fault opening injection pressure and of the following pressure decay until the shut-in at 1011\u00a0s (Fig. 14a). The shut-in pressure decay period is much larger in the model than in the field. This is because the calculated injection flow patch reached the model boundaries which are set at the formation pressure of 1.8\u00a0bar (at the depth of the injection), and consequently the patch was drained at the boundaries. In the field, there is less hydraulic connection (leakage) between the activated fracture and the surrounding aquifer. The model 1 underestimates the amplitude of the pressure increase at the monitoring well of about 1.3 bars (Fig. 14c). The pressure is varying much faster in the model and the hydraulic connection occurs earlier. In the model 1, there is a large flow injection in the fault as soon as the opening pressure is reached (Fig. 14b). In the field, that large flow variation happens 90\u00a0s later (when attempting to increase pressure again) showing that compared to the model the coupling between fault rupture and fluid penetration is much more complex in the field. Such a complexity is strongly affecting the calculated displacements which poorly match the measurements (Fig. 14d, e). With the same fault friction and cohesion as in the initiation cycle [15:22\u201315:41], both the normal and shear calculated fault displacements are underestimated by a factor of ~3 (blue curve, Fig. 14d, e). Model 5 with a lower friction fault does not significantly increase the calculated displacement (green curve, Fig. 14d, e). In addition, the shape of the shear displacement curve is poorly reproduced.\nTo better describe these experimental curves, we considered more complex fault activation schemes. First, in model 6, we considered that three fractures instead of one (Fig. 14g), all with the same dip and dip direction, are being activated (red curve, Fig. 14d, e). This is consistent with the geology of the interval which shows several natural planes more or less parallel to the PSZ (Fig. 3c). In that case, the model 6 calculates more displacement amplitude closer to the range of field observations, except that there is no calculated shear decay and that the fault normal closing is overestimated during the shut-in period. Second, in model 7, we considered that, in addition to the reopening of the natural fault, a new fluid driven fracture (i.e., hydrofracture) may have been created (Fig. 14h). Unfortunately, this hypothesis could not be checked after the test because of the injection borehole collapse. We hypothesized that the normal to the hydrofracture plane is oriented parallel to the main displacement trend. In that case, the calculated shear displacement shows a more complex shape closer to the field one during injection and during shut-in (cyan curve, Fig. 14d, e). In that second hypothesis, this would show that, during cycle 3, the measured shear displacement is more influenced by the hydrofracture opening than by slip on the PSZ.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nComparison of Shinohira and Itozawa fault (south) hydromechanical responses\nThe numerical analysis shows significantly different hydromechanical reactivation mechanisms between the Shionohira fault and Itozawa fault (south) segments (Fig. 15\n).\nGiven the shallow depth of the tests, we calculate that fault rupture propagated to the land surface in both tests (Fig. 15a, b). In the field, rupture reactivation was not observed at the land surface during our tests, except indirectly at Shionohira through the appearance of a water outflow. The fact that rupture is not clearly observed is explained by the simplicity of the model close to the surface where no soil layer was represented. In the field, this layer may have hidden most of the movements which are of infra-millimeter scale as calculated by the models. We may also advocate that there was no instrument to detect such infinitesimal movements at the land surface (which cannot be detected visually).\nThe reactivation mode is a Coulomb shear failure at Shionohira (Fig. 15c) and a complex tensile failure at Minakami-kita (Fig. 15d). The difference in the rupture modes explains the strong difference observed in the calculated normal and shear displacements on the fault of the two sites (Fig. 15a, b). Shear displacements at Shionohira are about a factor of 10 higher than normal displacements, which is in good accordance with a shear-induced-dilatant rupture (Fig. 15a). Most of the shear measured in the field is explained by slip on the PSZ in the model. Model also shows that leakage into the sandstones of the fault's western compartment controls fault pressure, and thus rupture growth (Fig. 15c). At Minakami-kita, shear and normal opening are of the same order of magnitude (Fig. 15b). In addition, model poorly reproduces the displacement curves during the cycle 3 of fault rupture propagation away from the injection borehole. Considering multiple natural planes activation and the creation of fluid driven fractures improved the match of model results to field signals. This is suggesting that the Minakami-kita field shear displacement cannot be explained just by slip on the PSZ (Fig. 15d).\nEffective stress variations are thus different between the two sites, and may mainly relate to difference in the fault zone properties rather than to the stress states which are dominated by the shallow depth of the tests. Indeed, thanks to a low static friction angle of 14\u00b0and no cohesion, the normal and shear stress variations on the Shionohira fault are small at the end of the test. This is not the case at Minakami-kita where the higher friction of 18\u00b0and the cohesion of 0.4\u00a0MPa necessitate a larger change in effective stress for the fault to reactivate. At the end of the test, both normal and shear stress fall to almost zero in the rupture patch.\nOne difficult-to-answer question is whether the Shionohira segment behaved differently because of different fault structure and properties, or if it is the recent rupture hitting the ground surface that refreshed these properties compared to Minakami-kita site. Answering such a question would obviously need repeating the SIMFIP field tests on a larger number of activated and un-activated fault outcrops. The tests presented in this study prove that it is possible since the setting of the tests is relatively easy, involving the drilling of a well and a 1\u20132 weeks deployment and SIMFIP testing.\n\n\n5.2\nInversion of SIMFIP displacements to estimate a deep tectonic fault frictional evolution\nFrom the field tests forward analyses of the Shionohira test, we get a residual friction coefficient varying of 0.23\u20130.25 (or\u00a0~\u00a014\u00b0friction angle, Table 2). These values are consistent with observations at laboratory scale of friction coefficients of 0.1\u20130.2 for Shionohira fault wet gouges with 30\u00a0wt% of H2O (Aoki et al., 2015).We then compared the previous forward models described in Section 4 with an inverse approach, in order to explore how the continuously monitored fault shear displacements (slip) can inform on fault friction evolution when the fluid pressure changes in the fault. Following the approach developed in Guglielmi et al. (2015a, 2015b), the fault is represented as a one-dimensional spring-slider model (Fig. 16\n). To obtain the shear displacement along a fluid-saturated, rate-and-state fault, we solve the following system of coupled equations:\n\n\u2022\nRate-and-state friction law:\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03b8\nV\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n=\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b8\nV\n\n=\n\n\u03bc\no\n\n+\naln\n\n\nV\n\nV\no\n\n\n\n+\nbln\n\n\n\n\nV\no\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nAging law:\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nd\u03b8\ndt\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\nV\u03b8\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nElastic coupling:\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nd\u03bc\ndt\n\n=\nk\n\n\n\nV\nlp\n\n\u2212\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nFluid pressure:\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\ndp\ndt\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b8\n\n\nd\u03b8\ndt\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nkh\n\n\u03b7\n\nL\n2\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\u2212\n\np\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\u03d5\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nShear displacement velocity (Slip velocity):\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\nV\n=\n\nV\no\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\nu\nlp\n\n\u2212\nu\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u2212\np\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bc\no\n\n\u2212\nbln\n\n\n\n\nV\no\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nShear displacement (Slip):\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\ns\n\nt\n\n=\n\nV\no\n\n\n\u222b\n0\nt\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\nu\nlp\n\n\u2212\nu\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u2212\np\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bc\no\n\n\u2212\nbln\n\n\n\n\nV\no\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\u2219\n\u2206\nt\n\n\nwith:\n\nV\n\nlp\n\u00a0=\u00a0load-point moving at constant velocity; the displacement of which is u\n\nlp\n\n\n\nk\u00a0=\u00a0stiffness of the spring\n\nV\u00a0=\u00a0velocity of the slider; the displacement of which is u\n\n\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a0friction coefficient\n\n\u03bc\n\no\n\u00a0=\u00a0reference friction coefficient corresponding to a reference slip velocity (V\n\no\n)\n\nD\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a0critical slip distance\na and b\u00a0=\u00a0non-dimensional rate-and-state parameters\n\n\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a0state variable.

Then, we invert the model output in an adaptive grid-search approach to obtain the best fit estimate of the rate-and-state friction parameters (\u03bco, a-b, Dc, Dieterich, 1979, Ruina, 1983). Here, we set-up the procedure in order to apply a fluid pressure loading in the fault and calculate the fault shear displacement. Applied on a SIMFIP test conducted at 280\u00a0m depth in faulted carbonates, the parameters estimated from this approach were consistent with values obtained in the laboratory on same carbonate rocks (Cappa et al., 2019).\nIn the case of the Shionohira test, we used the shear displacement measured on the fault plane during the 50.1\u00a0l\/min constant flow step (Fig. 8b). We obtain a reasonable fit between the measured data and our calculated displacement and pore pressure variation (Fig. 17a, b), for the following model parameters:\n\n\u2022\nNormal stress: 5\u00a0MPa, Principal Shear Zone Thickness: 20\u00a0mm\n\n\n\u2022\nSpring stiffness: 0.15\u00a0MPa\/um, Reference slip velocity: 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s\n\n\n\u2022\nPorosity: 0.45, Permeability: 1e\u221218\u00a0m2, Dilatancy coefficient: 5 10\u22126\n\n\n\n\u2022\na\u00a0=\u00a00.001, b\u00a0=\u00a00.008375, a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212 0.007375\n\n\n\u2022\n\u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a00.4, Dc\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcm\n\n\n\nWe get a reasonable restitution of the shear displacement variation and amplitude which shows that a velocity dependent friction law can be applied to describe the Shionohira fault slip variation. On the contrary, Fig. 17c, d show that we get a poor match to the field data of the Minakami-kita cycle 1 test, This supports what was estimated from the forward three-dimensional analyses that a much more complex reactivation of the fault occurred at this site. Hybrid modes of rupture may thus explain the measured shear rather than pure slip on the PSZ.\nAt the Shionohira site, we calculate a and b values of 0.001 and 0.008375, respectively. This gives a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.007375 showing that the PSZ tested at Shionohira is slightly rate weakening, considering the relatively slow velocity of 20\u201333.7\u00a0\u03bcm\/s of the field tests. We get a slight friction coefficient variation of ~0.02 from the rate-and-state friction inverse analyses (Fig. 17a). In the Minakami-kita test, the best case scenario remains far from the data. It corresponds to the following model parameters, a\u00a0=\u00a00.001, b\u00a0=\u00a00.00675, a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212 0.00575, \u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a00.4, Dc\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm. The friction coefficient variation does not explain the measured displacements (Fig. 17c).\nAt the Shionohira site, our field observations are also consistent with laboratory data that showed a velocity dependence of gouge friction above the sliding velocity of 21\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. Nevertheless, a velocity strengthening regime was identified between 21\u00a0\u03bcm\/s and 21\u00a0mm\/s, while we identify a velocity weakening of the PSZ in this range of velocities. Velocity weakening is clearly observed in the laboratory above 21\u00a0mm\/s. This difference might come from the relatively different experimental conditions between the field SIMFIP test and the laboratory tests. Indeed, using advanced fully coupled hydromechanical modeling, Cappa et al. (2019) showed that similar SIMFIP field displacements could be modeled either with a rate-weakening or a rate-strengthening behavior using parameters in the range of the values estimated in the laboratory. The reason is that they identified that the injection zone where there is the highest pressure may experience rate strengthening while at and beyond the tip of the high-pressure patch there may be rate weakening in the activated fault. In a SIMFIP test, the borehole displacements capture both borehole near and far field effects with time while these \u201ccontrasted\u201d effects are obviously much better isolated at laboratory scale.\nFinally, the key result is that SIMFIP tests allow exploring which friction law is potentially the best to describe fault rupture, giving an in-situ fault scale estimate of the fault frictional strength in the case of the recently ruptured Shionohira fault. It appears that (i) the fault static friction is low and consistent with laboratory scale estimations and (ii) during slip there is a slight tendency to frictional weakening that can be described using a rate and state friction law. These information are consistent with the triggering of the April 11, 2011 Fukushima-ken Hamadori Earthquake in some deeper fault conditions.\n\n\n5.3\nImplications of the approach in the in-situ estimation of the fault activation modes\nSIMFIP field tests allow providing activation mechanisms of surface fault ruptures and, thanks to the continuous fault displacement data, they allow a realistic tuning of fully coupled hydromechanical numerical models from the in-situ estimation of fault friction, cohesion, elastic stiffness and hydraulic conductivity. This is an improvement since current numerical simulations of surface rupture are usually \u201conly\u201d verified from laboratory scale-model tests (Anastasopoulos and Gazetas, 2007). We observe that complex ruptures can occur, involving variations in rock properties, non-uniform local stresses and coupled effects between the shallow aquifer and the fault zone activation. Indeed, the Shinohira test shows the influence of the hanging wall high permeability, the stress perturbation by the nearby valley and rate-weakening fault frictional behavior in modulating the rupture propagation. These information complement numerical models that usually use a Mohr\u2013Coulomb constitutive model for rupture initiation followed by a strain-softening friction model to describe the rupture growth (Anastasopoulos et al., 2007) and highlight the topographic free surface effect on rupture (Bransby et al., 2008). The Minakami-kita test provides an even more complex scenario constrained by the fault zone initial low permeability and cohesive strength that influence slip initiation on the identified PSZ followed by a failure propagation on other existing or newly created fractures within the fault zone. These scenarios that are here directly probed in situ are invoked as reasons for the surface rupture to occur in a previously ruptured zone or in a newly unruptured area (Gudmundsson et al., 2010). The protocol developed in this study is providing an in situ estimation of residual primary fault properties and rupture evolution that are key to estimate the potential for displacement that could be induced on a small fault segment by a designed synthetic earthquake. This protocol can thus contribute to improve methods to assess the safety of dam or nuclear waste disposal subject to earthquake such as the one proposed by F\u00e4lth et al. (2015).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThe shallow, 10\u201330\u00a0m deep, SIMFIP tests for fault reactivation by fluid injection identified in-situ two contrasted fault hydromechanical responses. The Shionohira surface rupture, recently activated during the 2011 Mw 6.7 Fukushima-ken Hamadori earthquake, displayed a dilatant slip response to hydraulic tests while the un-activated Itosawa fault (South) displayed a complex hybrid response related to both a higher frictional and cohesive strengths of the fault. The analysis of the induced Shionohira slip event showed that it could be modeled as a Coulomb rupture with an eventual dependency of friction on slip velocity, in good accordance with rate-and-state friction data obtained in the laboratory on Shinohira gouge samples. The tested Shionohira fault segment thus displays overall weaker properties than the Itosawa fault segment.\nFinally, the SIMFIP tool used in this study can be deployed deeper (0.5\u20131.5\u00a0km, see for ex. Guglielmi et al., 2021) to assess how a small fault segment may be triggered by a design earthquake, and what could be the maximum slip amount to consider for the safety assessment of structures such as nuclear waste repositories and dams.\n\n","154":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe structural styles observed across many fold-and-thrust belts do not comply with the classical Rocky Mountain style thrust sheets involving a sedimentary cover of regionally even stratigraphic thickness (i.e. layer-cake). In fact, many salt-detached fold-and-thrust belts such as the easternmost Fars of the Iranian Zagros (e.g. Callot et al., 2012; Snidero et al., 2019), the Northern Calcareous Alps of Austria (e.g. Granado et al., 2019; Strauss et al., 2020), the Proven\u00e7al Western Alps of France (Graham et al., 2012) developed from the inversion and incorporation of rifted margin sedimentary sequences involving early (i.e. precontractional) salt structures, such as minibasins flanked by diapirs. These structures have been termed isolated-minibasin provinces (Duffy et al., 2021), and involve minibasins formed by downbuilding completely surrounded by diapirs and conforming polygonal or subcircular arrays (Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; Harrison and Jackson, 2014; Duffy et al., 2018; Jackson and Hudec, 2017; Dooley et al., 2019; Strauss et al., 2020). Since the precontractional array of minibasins and salt structures is structurally complicated per se, the structural styles developed upon orogenic convergence become complicated further and difficult to ascertain and understand in 3D (Graham et al., 2012; Kergaravat et al., 2016; Granado et al., 2019). Cross-section and 3D model construction remain therefore challenging, and especially onshore, where seismic data is generally sparse and of low-quality (Legeay et al., 2019; Snidero et al., 2019). An important driver for researching these systems relates to their economic relevance as they include voluminous sediment accumulations, host key natural resources, and are a rich archive of global environmental and climate change.\nTo overcome these challenges and reduce uncertainty for decision making, we have designed an experimental sandbox modeling program to unravel how contractional reactivation of minibasins and flanking salt diapirs impact thrust wedge geometries and kinematics. In our experimental approach we have used a relatively simple scenario that allowed focusing on a series of topics which we consider fundamental: i) what is the impact of the basal salt architecture in the development of the salt-sediment system during downbuilding? ii) how do the resulting geometries control the structural styles and kinematics upon shortening, and how these relate to the critical taper of thrust wedges? iii) and how does syncontractional sedimentation impacts the deformation of the salt-sediment system during contraction? Our experimental results are presented, discussed, and compared to the Fars salient of Iran and the Northern Calcareous Alps of Austria.\n\n\n2\nAnalog modeling\n\n2.1\nRationale\nIn previous modeling works involving shortened isolated-minibasin provinces, modelers used an uneven distribution of minibasins and surrounding salt diapirs (Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; Ferrer, 2012; Callot et al., 2016; Dooley et al., 2019; Duffy et al., 2021) We have adopted a different approach by using a regular minibasin framework (Fig. 1a). Our closest natural analog, which served as inspiration for the experimental program, is the Fars Province of the Zagros Simply Folded belt of Iran. The designed experimental pattern results from the simplification of the structural grain found in the eastern Fars province, where extruded and buried salt diapirs are likely connected at depth through a network of salt ridges. Besides, by choosing such regular pattern we intend to avoid interpreting uncertainties related to an initially random distribution of minibasins. In particular, we investigate the influence of the salt basin geometry. To do this, we carried out and compared one model using a horizontal and constant thickness basal model salt, and other with an along-strike tapered-thickness model salt (Fig. 1). Such oblique-to-contraction distribution of salt stands as one of the main features not only in the Fars province (Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003; Bahroudi and Talbot, 2003) but also in the southern Pyrenees (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013) and the Jura Mountains (Sommaruga, 1999) among others.\nAs a second step in the experimental program, we also examine the impact of syncontractional sedimentation rate on the contraction of isolated-minibasin provinces. Being aware of the impact of erosion in natural and analog fold-and-thrust belts (e.g. Konstantinovskaya and Malavieille, 2011), we again invoke the Fars province to justify the use of just syncontractional sedimentation. In the Fars province, continuous sedimentation filled the Fars foreland from Campanian times (Snidero et al., 2020) where erosion localized in the crest of growing salt bodies and anticlines.\nThe experimental program was designed to analyze different scenarios during the same experiment. Such configuration should allow studying the geometrical and kinematical evolution from hinterland to foreland (i.e. closer to or away from the moving backstop wall) but also along the strike of thrust wedges involving such different domains. We also consider that other boundary conditions may be important to test, such as an oblique frontal buttress, or other (regular) angular relationships within the salt network, or syncontractional erosion; however, including these were considered out of the focus of this work.\n\n\n2.2\nAnalog material and scaling parameters\nThe models were constructed using materials suitable to carry out simulations of upper crustal deformation (see Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986; Schellart, 2000; Dell'Ertole and Schellart, 2013 for reviews). For modeling non-salt rheology, we used dry well-sorted quartz sand with an average grain size of 199\u00a0\u03bcm, a mean coefficient of friction (\u03c6) of 0.69 and a cohesive strength of 55\u00a0Pa (Ferrer et al., 2017), and an average angle of internal friction (\u00f8) of ~34\u00b0 and a bulk density of 1500\u00a0kg\/m3. Lohrmann et al. (2003) and Adam et al. (2005) demonstrated that sand displays an elastic\/frictional plastic behavior with transient strain hardening prior to transition to stable sliding. According to these authors, the behavior of dry quartz sand departs from the classically accepted Mohr-Coulomb rheology (e.g., Hubbert, 1951), but remains a good mechanical analog for modeling the brittle behavior of upper crustal rocks.\nAs an analog of salt in nature, a transparent high-viscosity polydimethylsiloxane polymer (Rhodosil GUM FB) from Bluestar Silicones was used (see Dell'Ertole and Schellart, 2013). At the low strain rates used in sandbox model experiments, this polymer behaves as a nearly-Newtonian fluid with low yield strength (e.g., Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986; Dell'Ertole and Schellart, 2013), simulating the natural behavior of evaporites (e.g., Weijermars et al., 1993; Couzens-Schultz et al., 2003). The density of the polymer at room temperature is 972\u00a0kg\/m3, and the viscosity is 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0Pa\u00b7s when deformed at an experimental strain rate of 1.83\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0cm\/s (Dell'Ertole and Schellart, 2013). Hereinafter, the term model salt will be used as substitute to the polymer and the standard salt tectonics terminology used when describing polymer-related structures. The scaling parameters are shown in Table 1\n.\n\n\n2.3\nDesign, set up and experimental procedure\nAn experimental rig consisting of two glass-sided walls, a fixed wall, and a moving backstop wall with precontraction dimensions of 70\u00a0cm long, 50\u00a0cm wide and 30\u00a0cm high was used (Fig. 1a). A strong plastic sheet was set at the base of the deformation rig; the plastic sheet is undeformable under the modeling conditions and maintains its length during experiments. While walls remained static during the downbuilding stage, the mobile backstop wall was pushed forwards by a software-controlled servo motor at a fixed velocity of 4\u00a0mm\/h.\nThe experimental setup consisted of a polygonal framework of minibasins with boundaries that were oriented at 60\u00b0 and \u221260\u00b0 with respect to the shortening direction (Fig. 1a). The model salt was laid on the basal plate from the backstop to a distal pinch-out located 55\u00a0cm away; laterally equivalent sand was added for the remaining 15\u00a0cm of the basal plate up to the opposite fixed vertical wall. The minibasins and salt ridges domain occupied a total stretch of 40\u00a0cm towards the hinterland. The experiments included three stages (Fig. 1b): an initial stage (Stage 1) where minibasins sank by downbuilding into model salt, and salt ridges grew vertically; sedimentation rate was adapted to keep up a balance between salt rise, minibasin sinking and sedimentation, to prevent burial of salt ridges or extensive salt extrusions. In consequence, the resulting sedimentation rate fitted an exponential trend; such balanced situation is found throughout Model 1 but varies laterally in Models 2, 3 and 4 (see Section 3.1.1). A second stage (Stage 2) where sedimentation rate outpaced the model salt rise rate. A third stage (Stage 3) of contractional deformation during which these structures were reactivated and squeezed and folding and thrusting occurred.\nThe initiation of salt evacuation by downbuilding (Stage 1) was triggered by pouring the first sand layer around the location of what would be the minibasin depocenters (Fig. 2\n). Downbuilding represents the syndepositional growth of a diapir whose exposed crest rises as sediments accumulate around it; the base of the diapir subsides together with the encasing strata, as the basin fills with sediment. Since poured loose sand creates a sedimentary lateral gradient (enhanced by a higher density than model salt; see Table 1), minibasins sank upon the onset of differential sedimentary loading (e.g. Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; Callot et al., 2016; Warsitzka et al., 2013; among others). Subsequently, new sand layers were sprinkled away from the minibasin depocenters, prograding towards the growing ridges (Fig. 1a). The experimental procedure was designed to generate outward expanding minibasins from a central seeding horizon reproducing bowl minibasins (Rowan and Weimer, 1998; Jackson et al., 2019; Fig. 2). Minibasins had a rhomboidal geometry whose long and short axes were 15\u00a0cm and 9\u00a0cm long, respectively (Fig. 1a). Stage 2 involved a higher sedimentation rate that tended to cover some of the growing salt ridges (Fig. 1b). The tested parameters included: 1) the thickness and geometry of the model salt, from constant to along-strike tapered; and 2) the syncontractional sedimentation rate (Table 2\n).\nA total of 4 experiments were carried out: Model 1 involved a 12\u00a0mm thick horizontal model salt. Conversely, Models 2, 3 and 4 included a tapered model salt with a 2 to 22\u00a0mm thickening trend perpendicular to the subsequent shortening direction (Fig. 1). Note that in these three experiments the model salt thickness at the center of the model was like that of model Model 1 (12\u00a0mm thick). Lateral changes in the model salt thickness were achieved by tilting the deformation rig by 2.3\u00b0. The model salt was set to rest until its top was horizontal to avoid undesired flow. The rig remained tilted during the whole experiment and the upper surface was initially horizontal prior to shortening (Fig. 1).\nSyncontractional sedimentation was absent (Models 1 and 2), low (Model 3) and high (Model 4) and was performed by increasing the regional level adding 2\u00a0mm thick layers each 12.5\u00a0mm or 5\u00a0mm of shortening in Models 3 and 4 respectively (Table 2). During shortening, allochthonous salt sheets were manually removed to minimize interactions with syncontractional layers. Total shortening was 5.5\u00a0cm for model Model 1, and 7.5\u00a0cm for Models 2, 3 and 4; these represent 8% and 11% of shortening, respectively.\n\n\n2.4\nData capture and analytical techniques\nTo facilitate structural interpretations, the sandpack was built by alternating layers of colored sand. Colored circular polymer plugs were added within the model salt at the base of sinking minibasins and the base of salt wall intersections to track model salt flow during the experimental procedure (Dooley et al., 2009; Ferrer et al., 2017). Finally, for those models without syncontractional sedimentation (i.e. Models 1 and 2), an orthogonal grid was overprinted on the surface as a strain marker to record structural evolution.\nFour techniques were used to analyze the experimental results: 1) Programmed computer-controlled time-lapse top-view and oblique-lateral high-resolution photographs to ensure the continuous monitoring of the morphometric evolution of models; 2) Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to characterize the kinematics of growing structures; 3) serial slicing of the experiments. These sections were interpreted and used as seeds to generate 3D image voxel reconstructions of the internal geometry of the models (Fig. 3\n); 4) step-by-step restoration of the interpretations of selected serial sections.\nSection restorations have been used to reconstruct the stepwise evolution of selected sections (Roma et al., 2018). Analog modeling yields a huge control for restoration parameters that, in nature, are usually sources of uncertainty: i) the surficial structural traces can be tracked, ii) the displacement vector field quantified after sectioning and PIV techniques and iii) stratigraphic thicknesses are known. Restoration of sections further complements other observations regarding the geometrical and kinematical evolution.\n\n\n\n3\nExperimental results\n\n3.1\nInfluence of the model salt geometry\n\n3.1.1\nDownbuilding stage\nDuring downbuilding (Stage 1) minibasins sank while salt walls grew, and salt stocks formed at the intersection of salt walls. Downbuilding on a constant thickness model salt resulted in a symmetric pattern of salt walls, stocks and minibasins (Fig. 2, Model 1). Minibasins were primarily welded across the model at approximately the same time, reaching similar depositional thicknesses; in the same way, flanking salt walls attained the same elevation. From the end of Stage 1 until the end of Stage 2 all salt walls were covered by sand whereas growth of intervening stocks persisted with model salt flaring and extruding onto the model's surface (Fig. 2, Model 1).\nOn the other hand, for those models with a tapered model salt (Models 2, 3 and 4), downbuilding resulted in an asymmetric minibasin pattern (Fig. 2, Model 2). Given the constant applied syndownbuilding sedimentation rate for each time step, a thick model salt allowed persistent minibasin formation and model salt upwelling. On the contrary, for thin model salt under the same syndownbuilding sedimentation rate, incipient structures were buried earlier (during Stage 1), and thus minibasins and salt walls were hardly or not developed.\nThe graph in Fig. 1c shows the relation between minibasin thicknesses at the end of Stage 1 and original model salt thickness. The plot shows that for an original model salt thickness of 4\u20138\u00a0mm, downbuilding was only active during a relatively small period of time, whereas for model salt thicknesses lesser than ca. 4\u00a0mm, downbuilding was never an active process. Then, over a threshold value ranging between 8 and 12\u00a0mm of original model salt thickness, minibasins' thickness increased linearly with that of the original model salt.\nTo summarize, our modeling shows that the role of the original model salt thickness in downbuilding processes is paramount, with formation of isolated minibasin provinces where model salt was originally thick and an undeveloped domain of horizontally layered sand over a static thin model salt. The transition between these domains consists of a system of salt pillows (Figs. 1c and 2).\n\n\n3.1.2\nSurface evolution during contraction\nCommon structural features were found through all the experiments: closing of salt ridges led to roof arching or box-folding, and backthrusts formed parallel to salt ridges, converging into the salt diapirs- and resulting into a polygonal pattern that mimics the inherited structural grain. The occurrence of indenters and reentrants (Dooley et al., 2009; Santolaria et al., 2021) (Figs. 3, 4a) points out that squeezing of salt stocks took place by forward displacement and indentation of the more rigid minibasins into these salt diapirs. Model salt squeezing led to formation of salt sheets (Fig. 3). In those models featuring tapered model salt, the inherited asymmetry structural architecture had a profound control on the structural styles developed by shortening. Contractional salt-related deformation dominated the isolated minibasin province, whereas a salt-detached fold-and-thrust belt formed from the thin model salt domain (Figs. 3 and 4). The impact of the model salt thickness distribution was not limited to the structural styles but also to the kinematics of the distinct structural domains (Figs. 3\u20135\n).\nAt the onset of contraction, shortening rapidly rejuvenated salt stocks as evidenced by salt extrusions. Further shortening resulted in the reactivation of the innermost salt ridges as well (Fig. 4a, 5a, 12mm of shortening). In Model 1, salt stock's rejuvenation and salt ridge's reactivation occurred symmetrically and reflected the inherited downbuilding pattern (Fig. 4a, 12mm of shortening). Conversely, in Model 2, reactivation of the innermost salt ridges graded into a foreland-directed frontal thrust striking nearly perpendicular to the shortening direction across the thin model salt domain (Fig. 5a, 12mm of shortening). In Model 1, additional shortening led to formation of a frontal thrust running parallel to the outermost salt ridge (Fig. 4a, 36\u00a0mm of shortening). In Model 2, across the isolated minibasin province (i.e. the thick model salt domain), reactivation of ridges occurred progressively from the hinterland to the foreland (from 12\u00a0mm to 60\u00a0mm of shortening; see Fig. 5a). Along strike, deformation graded from an area where squeezed salt stocks are linked by thrusts mimicking the inherited pattern of salt ridges to a set of linear thrusts; this change coincides with the transition from a well- to a hardly developed salt-sediment system. (Fig. 1c).\n\n\n3.1.3\nSection view and structural style evolution during shortening\nAs revealed and illustrated by the restoration of four sliced sections from Model 2 (Fig. 6\n), structural styles and related kinematics have been grouped into four different types: two of them are exclusive to the tapered model salt experiments and the other two are common to all the experiments. The first two types comprise the contraction of i) a constant thickness, horizontal model salt-sand sequence, where shortening led to the growth of a regular salt-detached fold-and-thrust belt with asymmetric thrust-related folds detached on thin model salt (Fig. 6a); and ii) a salt-pillow thrust belt formed from a poorly developed salt system (Fig. 6b). The other two include the contraction of well-developed salt-minibasin systems and resulting from the deformation of iii) salt ridges and minibasin edges (Fig. 6c) and iv) salt stocks and minibasin depocenters (Fig. 6d). All these structural styles correspond to a geometrically distinct but kinematically compatible contractional evolution. In broad terms, and regardless of the structural style, deformation propagated forwards while hinterland structures remained active (i.e. synchronous thrusting).\nConsidering the thin model salt domain (<4\u00a0mm) of Model 2, contractional deformation represents a regular, salt-detached, fold-and-thrust belt (Fig. 6a). The forward-developing thrust wedge grew sequentially and displays a taper angle of 5 degrees. Importantly, there is no correlation between thrust spacing or their nucleation points, and the along strike salt wall and minibasin design pattern (Fig. 1).\nAlong strike into thicker model salt (Fig. 6b), the preshortening configuration features a series of salt pillows distributed according to the original geometrical design (Fig. 6b). Salt pillows represent weak discontinuities that controlled the nucleation of thrusts and number of structures developed during shortening; in this case, three thrusts form rather than two as in the previous situation (Fig. 6b). The salt-pillow thrust belt is characterized by a dominant forward vergence of thrusts which emplaced following a forward-breaking sequence.\nWithin the isolated-minibasin province, we first focus on the evolution of the salt ridges and minibasins' lateral edges (Fig. 6c). At the beginning of the contractional stage, proximal salt ridges (i.e those close to the moving backstop wall) were preferentially squeezed, as evidenced by arched roofs, and acted as nucleation zones for thrusting and backthrusting (Fig. 6c). This deformation predated the transference of deformation to the distal salt ridges which remained, at this time, undeformed. Ongoing shortening resulted in further reverse faulting, foreland propagation of deformation and additional squeezing of salt ridges. Salt ridges became eventually closed along vertical secondary welds that became nucleation points for shorter-wavelength thrusts (Fig. 6c). Salt ridges closure and welding occurred in a zip-like mode as welded ridges nucleated faulting at progressively lower structural levels and involving deeper parts of the minibasins (Fig. 6c). Across the salt walls and minibasins transects (Fig. 6d), mild shortening is accommodated by narrowing of salt stocks whereas minibasins are mostly transported forwards attaining less deformation. As salt stocks closure continued, the proximal minibasins underwent forward translation and, in some cases, tilting; distal minibasins however, remained in situ or were slightly transported forwards (Fig. 6d).\nTilting occurred both forward and backward. It is worth noticing that tilting of minibasins in Model 1 (i.e. constant thickness model salt) was rare and restricted to the minibasins attached to the moving backstop (Figs. 4b). Additional shortening entailed further stock closure and continuous extrusion of allochthonous salt. At the end of experiments, some of the diapirs remained opened whereas others were secondary welded (see secondary welds in Fig. 6d). Teardrop diapirs and pedestal remnants are found in association with secondary welded salt stocks (Fig. 3). Thrusting is uncommon and when it occurs, it is associated with welded salt bodies whose secondary welds act as thrust nucleation points (Fig. 6c).\n\n\n\n3.2\nInfluence of syncontractional sedimentation rate\n\n3.2.1\nGeneral geometries and kinematics\nIn this section, we consider those experiments featuring a tapered model salt (Models 2, 3 and 4). At the onset of shortening, salt stocks were squeezed leading to salt extrusions. With ongoing shortening (Figs. 7, 12\n mm of shortening), a frontal thrust occurs along the thin-model salt domain while salt walls located near the moving backstop were reactivated in the thick model salt domain (Figs. 6 and 7). In consequence, diapir roofs became arched, onlapped and eventually overlapped by syncontractional sediments (Fig. 8a). Later on, in the isolated minibasin province of Models 2 and 3, deformation affected most of the salt ridges. However, in Model 4 (highest sedimentation rate) deformation remained concentrated on the inner structures (Fig. 7c; after 36\u00a0mm of shortening).\nBox-folds formed above the shortened salt ridges bounded by a backthrust and a younger thrust as observed at surface (Fig. 7) and recorded by syncontractional sand layers (Fig. 8b). In the salt-pillow thrust belt of Model 2 (i.e. no syncontractional sedimentation), deformation progressed forward with the occurrence of an arrow-like thrust, likely controlled by the inherited salt pillows (Fig. 7a, 36\u00a0mm of shortening). Conversely, deformation amplified the previously developed thrust in Models 3 and 4 (Fig. 7b, c, 36\u00a0mm of shortening), since syncontractional sedimentation hindered the forward propagation of deformation in both the salt-pillow thrust belt and fold-and-thrust belt domains.\nIn Model 2, further shortening (Fig. 7a, 60\u00a0mm of shortening) caused the development of a new frontal thrust encompassing the salt-pillow thrust belt and the fold-and-thrust belt domains, while the older thrusts propagated laterally from the center of the model (Fig. 7a). In Models 3 and 4, new thrusts also occurred, which are restricted to the salt-pillow thrust belt (Fig. 7b and c). Thrusting occurred in the form of a backthrust (Model 3, Fig. 7b) or a thrust (Model 4, Fig. 7c), both depicting curved surficial traces. Out of the isolated minibasin province, syncontractional sedimentation favored the amplification of previously developed hinterland structures resulting in thrusts with larger displacements and involving thicker successions (Fig. 9\n, sections a1, b1 and c1). At the end of the experiments after 75\u00a0mm of shortening, (Fig. 7), Model 2 showed more distributed deformation, with a denser framework of structures (i.e. more compartmentalization). In Model 4 (highest syncontractional sedimentation rate (Fig. 7c), deformation concentrated in a lesser number of structures, some of which were systematically shut-down by sediment burial (Fig. 9). In broad terms, syncontractional sedimentation delayed the propagation of deformation being enhanced with the increase in sedimentation rate.\n\n\n3.2.2\nSyncontractional minibasin tilting\nNow we focus on the evolution on minibasins in the isolated minibasin province. During shortening, most of the minibasins underwent forward tilting by rotation around a horizontal axis normal to shortening direction (Fig. 9). Some exceptions, where tilting has a backward sense, are the minibasins attached to the moving backstop and a few cases in Model 4 that are discussed below.\nForward tilting led to the formation of growth sequences and onlap relationships in the syncontractional sand layers (Fig. 8c). Tilting angle increased with syncontractional sedimentation: from 6 to 7 to 12\u201317 degrees in sections a4 and b4 of Fig. 9, respectively. However, when the sedimentation rate exceeds a threshold (discussed later), in our case a value between 0.8 and 2\u00a0mm\/h (sedimentation rates in Models 3 and 4), total tilting diminishes or even experiences counter rotation: from 12 to 17 degrees to 2\u20136 degrees in sections b4 and c4 in Fig. 9, respectively. Backtilting of minibasins during shortening is evidenced by hinterland-fanning growth strata whose sedimentary architecture registers a shift from a hinterland-directed onlap to a foreland directed onlap (Fig. 8d).\n\n\n3.2.3\nPrimary weld kinematics during contraction\nPrior to the shortening stage, minibasins have been primary welded. Primary welds are localized underneath the minibasins depocenter (Fig. 10\n). With shortening, these primary welds deform in a variety of ways that are tracked by sand remnants or polymer colour marker trails (Figs. 11 and 12\n\n). During contraction, some primary welds are sheared off by the forward displacement of the primary welded minibasins: these are herein named sheared primary welds (Dooley et al., 2019; Duffy et al., 2021): these welds remain fixed with respect the minibasin but have been laterally displaced (Fig. 11a.)\nAs minibasins undergo different degrees of tilting, primary welds either migrate in the sense of tilting or lengthen by rolling along the base of the minibasin defining rolled primary welds (Fig. 11b and c). In the first case, the original primary welds unweld at the same time new ones form (Fig. 11b). Alternatively, rolling and associated minibasin deformation can cause the original primary welded area to expand (Fig. 11c). Moreover, in Model 4, some of these sheared primary welds are also unwelded while minibasin are no longer in contact with the basement, defining delaminated primary welds (Fig. 8, sections c4, Fig. 11d and Fig. 13\n). Sheared primary welds are found in unrotated minibasins and thus are common in Model 2 where no syncontractional sedimentation was considered (Fig. 9). Rolled primary welds are related to tilting and therefore are observed in all the models having a tapered model salt, especially in Model 3, with moderate syncontractional sedimentation rate. Conversely, delaminated primary welds are exclusive of Model 4.\n\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nIsolated minibasin provinces refer to areas where minibasins formed by downbuilding are completely surrounded by salt walls and stocks forming a polygonal array of isolated basins (Harrison and Jackson, 2014; Kergaravat et al., 2016; Duffy et al., 2018; Jackson and Hudec, 2017; Dooley et al., 2019; Strauss et al., 2020). Many of these salt provinces have been subsequently shortened either by gravitational failure of passive margins (Rowan et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2008; Granado et al., 2016), or by convergence related to plate tectonics (Jackson and Harrison, 2006; Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; Granado et al., 2019). Some of these shortened isolated-minibasin provinces are outstandingly exposed, depicting steeply-dipping to overturned beds (e.g. Sivas basin of Turkey, Legeay et al., 2019) or, conversely, remain nearly horizontal (Central High Atlas, Calv\u00edn et al., 2018; Fars area, Zagros fold belt, Jahani et al., 2007). During contraction and due to the weakness of salt rock (Weijermars et al., 1993), contractional strain is focused on the salt body network whereas country rocks remain largely undeformed (Rowan and Vendeville, 2006). As a consequence, minibasins broadly preserve their original geometry, but can undergo translation, jostling, collision (Duffy et al., 2017) and rotations (Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; Ferrer, 2012; Callot et al., 2016; Duffy et al., 2021). Meanwhile, intervening salt bodies are squeezed which lead to the pressurization of salt, upwelling, flaring and eventual extrusion as allochthonous salt sheets (Nilsen et al., 1995).\nIn the following sections, we discuss how minibasins evolve in time during downbuilding and shortening, how deformation is transferred from the hinterland to the foreland and finally modeling results are compared to the Fars Salient and the Northern Calcareous Alps.\n\n4.1\nMinibasin growth, syncontractional tilting and primary weld evolution\nIn our experiments, which considered no external boundary conditions, incipient minibasins start as nearly symmetrical depocenters where subsidence is concentrated; continuous minibasin sinking is accommodated by model salt expulsion from beneath the minibasins (as in Dooley et al., 2019 and Duffy et al., 2021), resulting in broadly synformal-shaped depocenters, or bowl minibasins, hosted into mobilized salt (Trusheim, 1960; Rowan and Weimer, 1998; Vendeville, 2002). Basin-centered subsidence may continue as far as the source layer of salt is thick enough to account for minibasin sinking (Jackson and Hudec, 2017). In our modeling, minibasin growth can be represented by an exponential curve that clearly illustrates the relationship between time and minibasin thickness (Fig. 2b). Sedimentation of new layers is subordinate to the accommodation space created by minibasin sinking and hence sedimentary rate accelerates with time. Model sand density is much higher than that of model salt which controls this behavior. In fact, this assumes that sedimentation is continuous and overcomes topography creation. In nature, such rapid filling of the accommodation space is found in highly productive carbonate systems rather than clastic systems (e.g. Strauss et al., 2020).\nLater, salt flow from beneath the minibasin slows down as welding approaches or is completed and so, boundary drag forces dramatically oppose additional flow (Waltham, 1997; Wagner III and Jackson, 2011). It is worth noting how critical the model salt geometry is regarding the formation of minibasins and surrounding salt structures. Our experimental approach was designed to permit primary welding but to avoid sinking of the flanks and formation of turtle structures. As a result, concave minibasins with steeply-dipping flanks, salt bodies featuring well-developed pedestals and localized primary welds formed. In other words, minibasins are nearly symmetric across strike (i.e., bowls), hence, the system can be considered as initially balanced. Yet, it is potentially unstable since minibasins laid on a reduced pivoting point (i.e. the primary weld) and are free to move as they are surrounded by salt. Instability is counteracted by regional sedimentation that binds minibasins together and make them less independent.\nIn contrast to other analog modeling works dealing with the contractional reactivation of isolated minibasin provinces (Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; Ferrer, 2012; Duffy et al., 2021), the experiments presented here showed no evidence for minibasin rotations around vertical axes. One of the most plausible reasons has to do with the sizes and shapes of the minibasins as already outlined in the seminal work of Rowan and Vendeville (2006). If minibasins present different sizes, shapes and aspect ratios, squeezing of intervening salt can allow for vertical axis rotations, and jostling between minibasins. On the other hand, in our experiments minibasins only experienced horizontal axis rotation due to i) the presence of a thick and, thus, strong roof and ii) a regular pattern of minibasin architecture that also prevent for vertical axis rotation. Given the amount of shortening in our experiments, an obvious corollary is that to undergo vertical axis rotation, minibasins need unconstrained boundaries and contrasting aspect ratios as well as differing orientation with respect to the shortening direction.\nDuring contraction and detached along the basal model salt which acts as a d\u00e9collement previously developed minibasins may undergo forward displacement and tilting. These processes depend on several factors: i) the amount of shortening (e.g., Ferrer, 2012); ii) the syncontractional sedimentation rate (Fig. 9); iii) the original shape of minibasins (e.g., Rowan and Vendeville, 2006), iv) the orientation of the salt ridge network with respect to the shortening direction (e.g., Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; Ferrer, 2012); and v) the amount of remaining salt and enveloping salt flow patterns (e.g., Callot et al., 2016; Duffy et al., 2021).\nNearly vertical minibasins flanks favors indentation and the formation of vertical secondary welds. Conversely, more gentle flanks may promote imbrication (Callot et al., 2016). Shortening leads to the forwards displacement of minibasins and their primary welds and pedestals in between; if the bounding salt walls are secondarily welded the juxtaposed minibasins are also transported forwards (Fig. 13). This overall displacement led to the modification of the architecture of the system, including the original location of primary welds whose forward displacement along the base resulted in sheared primary welds (Figs. 11 and 14\n).\nIn our experiments, tilting of minibasins has a dominant forward sense. This is most likely triggered by the abounding backward vergence of thrusting (i.e. backthrusts). Even though the limited offset of these backthrusts at the beginning of shortening, it is enough to promote forward tilting of the minibasin. Forward tilting is lately enhanced by the resistance exerted by primary welds acting as pivot points and new syncontractional sand layers. Rolled primary welds (Fig. 14) evolution is characterized by a continuous migration of the primary weld together with a significant amount of tilting of minibasins (up to 12\u00b0). The architecture of syncontractional sequences responds to the forward leaning minibasins as shown by growth strata geometries (Figs. 7 and 8). Growth strata geometries record the continuous tilt through the experiments, as well as the forward displacement of minibasins leading to a combination of sheared and rolled primary welds (Fig. 14).\nA relevant observation in our experiments is that minibasin tilting is enhanced in the model that involves a low sedimentation rate (Model 3) whereas higher sedimentation rates (Model 4) hamper it (Fig. 13, 55\u00a0mm of shortening). This suggests the existence of a specific syncontractional sedimentation rate threshold over which minibasin tilting slows down or even swifts from forwards to backwards. The influence of syncontractional sedimentation may be interpreted as the result of the delay of shortening propagation to the foreland, which leaves less time and thus less shortening to affect the distal minibasins, effectively more largely buried under sediments. Alternatively, it may be interpreted by the direct effect of differential loading caused over specific minibasins by uneven sedimentation. Once tilted, the addition of new syncontractional layers always increases the differential stratigraphic load over minibasins and in consequence it favors the ongoing tilting trend. Quantitatively speaking, however, higher syncontractional sedimentation rates produce a broader distribution of the sedimentary load and therefore less differential loading, increasing the roof strength and making the minibasins interdependent. In this situation, it may be easier (in comparison to lower syncontractional sedimentary rate scenarios) for other external factors to counteract the forward tilting trend. For example, secondary welding of salt diapirs and salt walls can cause minibasin rotation to stop. After secondary welding, minibasins can become locked-up and act as a mechanically strong beam. A stronger beam of connected minibasins can accommodate additional shortening through forward displacement and inflation of salt at the base (Fig. 11d and 13, 75\u00a0mm shortening). In this scenario, primary welds become unwelded and minibasins delaminated. Shifts on tilting sense are reflected by changes in the geometrical pattern of syncontractional sedimentation: growth strata shifts and opposes previous trends (Figs. 8 and 13, 55 to 75\u00a0mm of shortening). This reflects the last stage in the evolution of sheared and rolled primary welds with the delamination of primary welds (Figs. 11, 13 and 14).\n\n\n4.2\nShortening distribution and deformation transfer\nOur experimental models highlight how an along-strike tapered basal salt controls the preshortening evolution of the salt system and the resulting geometries led to contrasting structural styles and kinematics during contraction. In this sense, two clear end-members can be differentiated: i) if salt is thin enough, a fold-and-thrust belt characterized by synchronous thrust activity within a dominant breaking-forward thrust sequence; in this case, thrust spacing was controlled by the thickness of the brittle-ductile sequences and, to some extent, by coupling with the adjacent salt pillow system; and ii) a shortened isolated minibasin province characterized by necked-off salt bodies, forward translation and tilting of minibasins. In between both, the influence of the inherited pattern is still appreciable in a situation where salt pillows localize contractional deformation regardless their orientation with respect to the shortening direction (Jackson et al., 2011; Callot et al., 2012; Ferrer, 2012; Dooley et al., 2013; Moretti et al., 2013). The key observation is that no matter the structural geometries the whole wedge system maintains along-strike kinematic compatibility. Thus, one of the most relevant results of our modeling is that while the amount of shortening is the same for a given salt-influenced fold-and-thrust belt it can result in contrasting structural styles. The total shortening accommodated by slip along thrusts must be equal to that generated by squeezing and necking of weak salt which tends to be cryptic. Section restoration of salt-related contractional systems is always challenging (Granado et al., 2019; Rowan and Ratliff, 2012). As derived from our results, structural restoration of serial cross-sections in fold-and-thrust belts is a complementary constraint when assessing shortening estimates, since it is notoriously difficult to appreciate the amount of shortening for those areas where (cryptic) deformation has been taken up \u2013primarily- by diapir squeezing, salt rise and extrusion.\nThe way deformation is localized or transferred from the hinterland to the foreland also varies from the fold-and-thrust belt domain to the isolated minibasin province. In the fold-and-thrust belt, thrust wedge development responds to the critical taper theory (Dahlen, 1990): new thrusts form or former structures are reactivated to maintain the critical taper of the thrust wedge. Syncontractional sedimentation delays forward propagation of deformation since the orogenic wedge angle lowers with each syncontractional layer and more internal deformation is needed to reach the critical taper angle (Storti and McClay, 1995; Graveleau et al., 2012). The position of the deformation front is clearly constrained by syncontractional sedimentation (Pla et al., 2019), being more distal in the model without syncontractional sedimentation and more proximal in the model with high syncontractional sedimentation rate (Fig. 7a and c, respectively).\nIn our models, the taper angle abruptly diminished towards the isolated minibasin provinces. In that domain and as a general rule, deformation was broadly transferred forwards in a forward-stepping sequence. Exceptions are found. At the onset of deformation, mild deformation extends far from the moving backstop as evidenced by rejuvenation of distal diapirs (Figs. 4, 5). This implies that the model salt-sand package acts as a rigid beam that allowed for the transference of deformation towards distal areas, which is otherwise typical in sandbox analog models (Costa and Vendeville, 2002; Smit et al., 2003; Santolaria et al., 2015; Granado et al., 2017). This does not discard that further shortening concentrates in proximal salt walls and stocks. Besides, Out-of-sequence thrusting is common in salt-detached contractional systems. In our case, such activity is subordinate to the main forward-stepping sequence trend. Synchronous thrusting was commonly observed.\nAs pointed out by Rowan and Vendeville (2006) and Ferrer (2012), at the end of the contractional stage, contractional deformation extends across the isolated minibasin province even though salt diapirs are not completely closed (see Fig. 7). Since the closure and necking of salt bodies can accommodate a limited amount of shortening, secondary welding of proximal salt walls promotes the transfer of deformation to more distal salt walls by translation of juxtaposed minibasins along the basal model salt. This allows inferring that in these settings the forward transfer of deformation takes places through a framework of secondary welds (Fig. 10). Once again, this framework may be related to the preshortening configuration of the salt-sediment system. Stress transmission through the secondary welds framework would be analogous to the stress bridges developed in granular media (e.g. Gallagher et al., 1974). In addition, syncontractional sedimentation strengthens the overburden, and it becomes progressively harder for salt to rise and flare, so salt ridges may stay open longer, and shortening is then transferred outboard.\n\n\n4.3\nComparison to natural examples\n\n4.3.1\nThe Fars Salient\nThe Fars salt province of Zagros fold-and-thrust belt (Iran) forms a structural salient along the deformation front of the Zagros orogenic system (Sepehr and Cosgrove, 2004; Tavani et al., 2020; see Fig. 15a). The occurrence of this prominent salient, as observed in several other contractional fold-and-thrust belts (e.g. Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; Izquierdo-Llavall et al., 2018), is attributed to a thicker sequence os Late Precambrian to Cambrian Hormuz evaporites which represent the regional d\u00e9collement (e.g. Sepehr and Cosgrove, 2004; McQuarrie, 2004). On top of it, a 7\u201315\u00a0km thick, Paleozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary pile thickens towards the foreland (James and Wynd, 1965; Alavi, 2004).\nThe eastern Fars most outstanding feature (Fig. 15a) is a high concentration of extruding and buried diapirs cored by the Hormuz Salt (Trocm\u00e9 et al., 2011). Salt bodies are largely recognized to predate the Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic Zagros orogeny (Callot et al., 2012). Strong supporting evidence for preorogenic diapirism are the Paleozoic and Mesozoic halokinetic sequences described from seismic and field observations (Edgell, 1996; Letouzey and Sherkati, 2004; Callot et al., 2007; Perotti et al., 2016; Stewart, 2018; Snidero et al., 2019, 2020). Shortening and squeezing of the eastern Fars diapirs resulted in a strong variability of the geometry and orientation of folds, often characterized by subordinate thrusts oblique to the main tectonic grain (see Fig. 15a). The structural style has been related to the presence of preexisting salt diapirs (e.g. Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; Jahani et al., 2009; Callot et al., 2012). Its presence is known to influence the structural spacing and the strike of structure and to deflect the trend of the fold limbs as demonstrated by analog modeling experiments involving isolated diapirs (Dooley et al., 2009; Duffy et al., 2018; Santolaria et al., 2021).\nBased on seismic data from the Persian Gulf and supported by analog modeling, Callot and coauthors (2012) pointed out Fars' salt stocks evolved from deep-seated salt ridges during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. This implies that buried and currently extruding salt stocks are not isolated but connected through a framework of salt ridges or salt walls at depth (e.g., Snidero et al., 2019; Hassanpour et al., 2020). The salt stocks are suggested to be located at the junction of salt ridges as proposed for instance in the Pre-Caspian basin (Barde et al., 2002), and observed in analog modeling (Rowan and Vendeville, 2006; this study). Our experimental results stress the importance of the inherited pattern of salt ridges as a first order controlling factor for the obliquity of contractional structures. Thus, we suggest that the structural pattern observed in the eastern Fars area resulted from of 1) the precontractional distribution of salt walls or ridges in combination with 2) structures related to salt stock squeezing.\nIn the western sector of the Fars Salient, almost no diapirs crop out. The transition between these two areas coincides with the eastern limit of the Qatar Arch structural high. (Fig. 15a). The western Fars structures are characterized by folds, tens to hundred-kilometer long, regularly spaced and trending nearly perpendicular to the shortening direction (Agard et al., 2005; McQuarrie, 2004). The change in the structural style is associated with the thinning of the Hormuz Salt towards the Qatar Arch structural high (Bahroudi and Talbot, 2003; Perotti et al., 2011). The role and characteristics of this transition has been previously investigated through different analog modeling setups. In each case, a thick salt domain was used in order to model the eastern Fars, where i) Bahroudi and Koyi (2003) do not consider preexisting diapirs and set an abrupt transition to a frictional detachment and ii) Callot et al. (2012) considered preexisting diapirs and a progressive thinning towards the Qatar Arch structural high analog. The detachment rheology transition in Bahroudi and coauthors' experiment led to the formation of a salt-bearing, low taper angle fold belt salient on top of the d\u00e9collement and a higher taper angle thrust wedge in the frictional detachment area. These contrasting structural styles were separated by strike slip fault as the ones interpreted to limit the Fars Platform (Husseini, 1988; Hessami et al., 2001). In Callot and coauthors' model, the progressive thinning of the salt-equivalent layer resulted in a gradual decrease of the structural spacing. Besides, the addition of preexisting diapirs led to the occurrence of short, wide and sinuous structures, a closer analog to the eastern Fars area. As observed in our models and in agreement with those of Callot et al. (2012), the presence of the observed diapirs is explained by the existence of a thick enough the Hormuz Salt unit which allowed the formation of the salt-sediment system (see Section 3.1). However, in Bahroudi and Koyi's (2003) and Callot and coauthors (2012) models, an excessive thinning of the salt-equivalent layer resulted in a less effective d\u00e9collement, entailing the formation of a reentrant. This contradicts what it is observed in the Fars Salient deformation front where no reentrant exists. This suggests that, although thinner, the Hormuz Salt still acts as an effective d\u00e9collement above the Fars Platform.\nSimilarities with the Fars Salient also exist in terms of shortening and sedimentary rates. The presented cross-section (Fig. 15b) implies a 13.7% of total shortening mainly accumulated over the last 30 Myr, with an average syncontractional depositional rate of 34\u00a0m\/Ma in the Persian Gulf (Perotti et al., 2016) and over 2\u00a0km of synfolding sediments deposited on-shore. This ratio is equivalent to the high syncontractional sedimentary rate of our modeling, exceeding the 0.8 to 2\u00a0mm\/h threshold that hampered the minibasin rotation. In fact, the analog modeling results of model 4 (Fig. 9), match significantly well the attained values of the Fars minibasin tilting (Fig. 15b).\n\n\n4.3.2\nThe Northern Calcareous Alps\nThe Northern Calcareous Alps are a N-to NW-directed salt-detached fold-and-thrust belt belonging to the European Alpine orogenic system (Linzer et al., 1997). The fold-and-thrust belt is characterized by multiple structural orientations, large, overturned panels, geological contacts either omitting or repeating stratigraphy and sudden changes on fold-wavelength associated with stratigraphic thickness changes (Granado et al., 2019); all these features are systematically associated with the existence of a Permian-Triassic layered evaporitic sequence at the bottom of the deformed succession of Triassic-Jurassic carbonates (Fig. 16a). One remarkable example is represented by the Gamsstein minibasin (Fig. 16b). Erosional levelling and large tilting (ca. 45\u00b0 to the NW) provide an almost unique example of the cross-sectional view of a bowl-shaped Middle-Upper Triassic carbonate minibasin sunk into a thick layer of salt (Strauss et al., 2020). The Gamsstein minibasin and its flanking salt structures were later incorporated on the Northern Calcareous Alps fold-and-thrust belt with the onset of convergence by about Middle-Late Jurassic times (Granado et al., 2019). The northern boundary of the minibasin is marked by a subtractive contact that juxtaposes syn-orogenic Cretaceous strata on the hanging wall to Middle Triassic strata on the footwall; the contact is however characterized by strong compressional fabrics. In comparison, further east in the Northern Calcareous Alps typical hanging wall flats on footwall ramps relationships are observed, bringing older on younger stratigraphy (Fig. 16a, c) such as in other well-known fold-and-thrust belts (Boyer and Elliot, 1982). Detailed geological mapping of the area (Schnabel et al., 2002) shows similar changes in stratigraphic thickness and stratigraphic omissions to those reported from around the Gamsstein minibasin, as well as the presence of salt soling thrust sheets. Given the scarcity of exploration wells in the Northern Calcareous Alps, the construction of cross-sections entails significant uncertainty; here, we use sandbox models as structural-stratigraphic templates to reduce it.\nBoth illustrated sections display markedly different structural relationships: whereas the Gamsstein minibasin shows a significant foreland-ward tilting of about 45\u00b0, the eastern section displays a rather typical hinterland-dipping imbricate fan of thrusts. The cause(s) for the NW-tilting of the Gamsstein minibasin (Fig. 16b) are still unclear: tilting could have occurred during the passive margin stage as a result of salt-detached extension, however no stratigraphic record for that tilting in the form of roll-over wedges has been found within the Gamsstein minibasin. On the contrary, analog modeling suggests that loading by syncontractional growth strata may contribute to tilting (up to 20\u00b0), but large erosion has reduced growth strata preservation to a minimum around the Gamsstein minibasin (Schnabel et al., 2002), shedding no light into this. Our modeling additionally suggests that forward tilting can relate to shortening and translation, including back-thrusting along secondary welds, leading to d\u00e9collement, rolling and delamination of primary welds (Fig. 14), in a way similar to what has been described in the Sivas Basin, for instance (Kergaravat et al., 2016; Legeay et al., 2019). Other mechanisms that have not been considered in our modeling but that can potentially be responsible for the observed tilting of minibasins in fold-and-thrust belts in general are the late involvement of the presalt basement by thick-skinned shortening (Dooley and Hudec, 2020), and\/or the presence of hinterland-dipping basement steps acting as ramps during salt-detached contraction (Granado et al., 2021). In the case of the eastern cross-section (Fig. 16c), the main uncertainty relates to the shape of the footwalls; to address this uncertainty we have used the results of models Model 2 (Fig. 9), where salt pillows nucleated a series of forward-breaking thrusts bringing older stratigraphy onto younger stratigraphy.\nThe analog modeling results presented here match significantly well with the regional map patterns of the Northern Calcareous Alps (Schnabel et al., 2002), where strained stripes of evaporites and related rocks such as rauhwacken (see Warren, 2016 p. 656) have been recently interpreted to rather relate to the squeezing, jostling and secondary welding and thrust welding between closely juxtaposed isolated minibasins (Granado et al., 2019, 2021; Strauss et al., 2020). Upon orogenic convergence, and contraction of the salt network, all inherited complexities have promoted overly complicated tectonic histories when viewed without an eye for salt tectonics.\n\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe evolution of a salt-sediment system depends on the original thickness and distribution of salt deposits. For those contractional systems where d\u00e9collement horizons root in salt, the preshortening configuration of the salt-sediment system exerts a primary control on subsequent contraction. As shown by our modeling, that rapid changes on structural styles develop from originally thin to thick salt areas. Isolated-minibasin provinces show contractional features mimicking the inherited salt ridges pattern at the end of downbuilding; on the other hand, thrusting nucleates at salt pillow apexes, where the original salt deposits are thinner. Finally, a linear fold-and-thrust belt develops where the salt deposits were thinnest. Hence, a broad along-strike spectrum of structures from salt-related to thrust wedge-related occur; there is no need to invoke abrupt thickness changes in the basal salt layer, or basement features, to explain sudden changes in the along-strike structural style of the fold-belt. Apparent strike-slip motions may be confused when dealing with closely juxtaposed minibasins bound by sub-vertical secondary welds.\nContractional deformation transports minibasins forward, coinciding with the reactivation and progressive squeezing of the bounding salt ridges, until they become secondarily welded. Welded salt ridges led to the formation of a secondary weld framework that permits deformation transfer towards the foreland, entailing forward displacement of colliding minibasins and shearing of primary welds.\nWhere model salt was originally thin, syncontractional sedimentation prevents rapid forward propagation of thrusting, increases the wavelength of structures and the fault displacement. On the contrary, where model salt was originally thick, syncontractional sedimentation promotes the rotation of minibasins around a horizontal axis normal to the shortening direction. Also, in these domains, syncontractional sedimentation prevents forward propagation of the deformation Forward minibasins rotation entails migration of the original primary weld (i.e. rolled primary weld), backthrusting, as well as development of growth strata geometries in the syncontractional sediments. A substantial increment of syncontractional sedimentation rate, which better distributes the sedimentation and decreases sedimentary load differences, slows down minibasins tilting, whereas delaminated minibasins and related delaminated welds developed.\nSome of the assertions above may seem rather obvious; however, these principles are fundamental to understand the structural complexity of many fold-and-thrust belts. Still, it is in the common knowledge that different structural orientations relate to different orogenic events with differing contractional directions, or to large strike-slip tectonics.

The microfabric analysis of fault rocks deformed at depths inaccessible for in-situ stress measurements is powerful to constrain the stress and strain-rate history during deformation. Amphiboles in polyphase metamorphic rocks are known as high-strength rock-forming minerals acting as rather rigid inclusions at temperature conditions below 650\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C, without significant strain accumulation by dislocation creep (e.g., Berger and St\u00fcnitz, 1996; Brodie and Rutter, 1985; Cao et al., 2010; Imon et al., 2004; Nyman et al., 1992; Shelley, 1994). At high stresses and strain-rates, amphibole deforms by kinking and twinning associated with cataclasis (e.g., Borg, 1972; Buck, 1970; Hacker and Christie, 1990; Nyman et al., 1992; Park et al., 2020; Rooney et al., 1975; Rooney et al., 1970; Shelley, 1994; Sobott, 1979). Given its relatively low fracture toughness and low melting temperature, amphibole is prone to comminution and melting at high strain-rates during seismic faulting, in contrast to quartz (e.g., Koch and Masch, 1992; Spray, 2010). In this respect, amphibole-rich lithologies represent \u201cweak\u201d layers during pseudotachylyte formation as opposed to quartz-rich lithologies.\nMechanical twins are important microstructures to indicate differential stresses during faulting, because they form at a critical resolved shear stress on the twin system, which is in a first approximation independent on temperature and strain-rate (e.g., Tullis, 1980). Therefore, extrapolations from laboratory measurements to natural conditions are not as critical as for other deformation mechanisms, as for example dislocation glide. Furthermore, mechanical twins can easily be detected by their specific crystallographic relationship to the host orientation, even after modification by twin boundary migration (e.g., Cao et al., 2010). Given the high critical resolved shear stress of 200\u2013400\u00a0MPa for amphibole (\u2212101)[101] twins, constrained by experiments of Rooney et al. (1970), they ideally can detect deformation at transient high differential stress conditions.\nLocal and transient stress-strain concentrations resulting from high-viscosity inclusions in a low-viscosity, creeping matrix has been suggested to lead to \u201cplastic instabilities\u201d and \u201cthermal runaway\u201d, finally causing the formation of pseudotachylytes at depth, whereas in the long term the rocks behave by creep (Hobbs et al., 1986; Hobbs and Ord, 1988; John et al., 2009; Kaus and Podladchikov, 2006; Koch and Masch, 1992; Regenauer-Lieb and Yuen, 2004; Schmid and Casey, 1986; Sibson, 1980; Thielmann et al., 2015; White, 2012; White, 1996). However, unequivocal microstructural evidence for thermal runaway, for example systematic variations in grain sizes that document increasing strain towards pseudotachylytes, is still missing (Papa et al., 2020).\nTransient high-stress deformation at greenschist facies conditions, where the rocks undergo creep on long-term, however, has also been reported to be caused by stress redistribution related to the rupture of nearby seismically active faults (e.g., K\u00fcster and St\u00f6ckhert, 1999; Trepmann and St\u00f6ckhert, 2003; Trepmann and St\u00f6ckhert, 2002; Trepmann and St\u00f6ckhert, 2001), leading to the formation of pseudotachylytes at small distances to the tip of the seismically active fault (N\u00fcchter et al., 2013). High stress-loading rates are characteristic for such a scenario as opposed to the relatively continuous stress-built up within high-viscosity inclusions surrounded by a creeping low-viscosity matrix (Trepmann et al., 2017; Trepmann and Seybold, 2019; Trepmann and St\u00f6ckhert, 2009).\nThe Silvretta basal thrust fault in the central European Alps (Fig. 1\n) is known for the well-developed pseudotachylyte-bearing amphibole-rich gneisses that occur in association with mylonites and ultramylonites formed at the same depths (Bachmann et al., 2009; Koch, 1990; Koch and Masch, 1992; Masch, 1970; Schmutz, 1995). Koch and Masch (1992) interpreted the amphibole-rich gneisses as high-viscosity inclusions in a low-viscosity matrix of quartz-rich gneisses that are undergoing creep. However, unambiguous microstructural evidence that this viscosity contrast can explain the occurrence of pseudotachylytes is still missing. Furthermore, the deformation-record of amphibole in the host gneisses has so far not been used to unravel the deformation history. Here, we analyze the microfabrics of amphibole and quartz in pseudotachylyte-bearing gneisses as well as the microfabrics in neighboring quartz-rich layers concordant to the foliation of the gneisses from the Silvretta basal thrust. The aim is (1) to constrain the deformation history by analyzing the microfabrics of amphibole associated with pseudotachylytes in the gneisses in relation to the quartz microfabric, and (2) to test whether a gradient of increasing strain within quartz-rich layers towards pseudotachylyte-bearing, amphibole-rich layers can be observed that would indicate thermal runaway.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Silvretta crystalline situated in the central Alps (Fig. 1) represents one of the Upper Austroalpine basement nappes (Froitzheim et al., 1994; Schmid et al., 2004). During the Alpine orogeny the nappe was detached and thrusted over the Penninic units (Laubscher, 1983). The original crystalline substratum (Insubric crystalline) is assumed to have a similar composition as the Silvretta nappe (Schmutz, 1995). In the investigated area, at the border of the Engadine window, the Silvretta crystalline mainly consists of a series of polymetamorphic paragneisses, orthogneisses and amphibole-rich gneisses (Maggetti and Flisch, 1993; Masch, 1970; Th\u00f6ni, 1988; Th\u00f6ni, 1981; Wenk, 1934). Alpine metamorphic peak conditions in Lower to Upper Cretaceous times increase from the West to the East with temperatures of 350\u2013540\u00a0\u00b0C directly at the contact to the Engadine window (Hurford et al., 1989; Maggetti and Flisch, 1993; Th\u00f6ni, 1981). Fault rocks of the Silvretta crystalline basal thrust comprise pseudotachylytes and (ultra-) mylonites, developed at lower greenschist facies conditions reaching 300\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C as indicated by the mineral assemblage containing stilpnomelan (Koch, 1990; Koch and Masch, 1992; Masch, 1970; Schmutz, 1995). These conditions are consistent with related microfabrics in the host rocks of the pseudotachylytes (Bachmann et al., 2009; Trepmann et al., 2017). Generally, the occurrence of pseudotachylytes, mylonites and ultramylonites is related to the basal thrust fault (Fig. 1), where the pseudotachylyte-bearing zone is restricted to a few meters to about 300\u00a0m above the thrust plane (Koch and Masch, 1992; Masch, 1974; Masch, 1970; Schmutz, 1995). In the footwall of the Silvretta basal thrust no pseudotachylytes have been reported and the pseudotachylytes do not contain any Penninic unit components. Therefore, the pseudotachylytes have formed during the initial detachment of the nappe and before the transport onto the Penninic units (Koch, 1990; Koch and Masch, 1992; Laubscher, 1983; Schmutz, 1995; Th\u00f6ni, 1988). Isotopic investigations of pseudotachylytes indicate that they formed at about 75\u00a0Ma (Rb\/Sr: Th\u00f6ni, 1988) to 62\u00a0Ma (Ar\/Ar: Bachmann et al., 2009). Although pseudotachylytes are most common in amphibole-rich gneisses, they can be found in all gneisses (Koch and Masch, 1992). The more mica-rich the gneisses, the rarer the pseudotachylytes (Schmutz, 1995). In contrast, mylonites only occur in quartz-rich gneisses. In cases where pseudotachylytes occur within mylonites, they cross cut the mylonitic foliation, which is predominantly subparallel to the Variscan foliation, thus pseudotachylytes are interpreted to be younger than mylonites (Koch, 1990; Koch and Masch, 1992; Masch, 1970). Ultramylonites characterized by a very fine grain size and narrowly spaced foliation can occur in gradual transition to mylonites, i.e. subparallel to the mylonitic foliation, or with sharp boundaries crosscutting the foliation of the host rock, which is then interpreted to have formed from deformed pseudotachylytes (Koch, 1990; Koch and Masch, 1992).\nIn the studied area, the foliation of gneisses and mylonites is mainly subparallel to the Variscan foliation, striking WE to NE with shallow dip angles of 10 to 30\u00b0 (Hammer, 1914; Koch and Masch, 1992; Masch, 1970; Schmutz, 1995). Pseudotachylytes occur as concordant (strike: N to NW; dip: shallow W to SW), discordant (strike: NE; dip: NW) and branching dikes as well as in breccias (e.g., Masch, 1970; Schmutz, 1995).\n\n\n3\nMethods\nPseudotachylyte-bearing gneisses were collected from the border of the Silvretta crystalline to the units of the Engadine window from the Ochsental, Jamtal and Val Tasna as well as the Hexenkopf (Koch and Masch, 1992; Schmutz, 1995). Samples that show a lithological contact between amphibole-rich gneisses and quartz-rich layers concordant to the foliation of the gneisses (Fig. 1b-d) were selected for this study: samples LB20\u201322 (47\u00b001\u201800\u201cN\/10\u00b028\u201800\u201cE), CT623, CT628 (46\u00b053\u201815.37\u201cN\/10\u00b010\u201855.55\u201cE) and CT772 (46\u00b050\u201854.97\u201cN\/10\u00b012\u201818.24\u201cE). The direction vertical to the foliation is taken as \nz\n-axis and the stretching lineation, if present, is taken as \nx\n-axis of the strain ellipsoid for the gneisses. Thin sections ca. 30\u00a0\u03bcm in thickness were prepared perpendicular to the main foliation (i.e. parallel \nz\n) and parallel to the stretching lineation (\nx\n-axis), if present. They were investigated by polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy using a SU5000 Hitachi field emission microscope equipped with a NordlysNano electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) detector. For EBSD investigations, thin sections were polished for 1.5\u00a0h with an alkaloid colloidal suspension (Syton). The samples were tilted 70\u00b0 relative to the horizontal and were measured with a step size of 0.5 to 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm. An acceleration voltage of 20\u00a0kV and 15 to 25\u00a0mm working distance were applied. The Aztec 4.2 and CHANNEL 5 software by Oxford Technology were used for acquiring and processing of the data, respectively. For data acquisition we used 57 and 92 reflectors for quartz and amphibole, respectively, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 or 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 binning and detected 6 bands (band centers). All polefigures are given as stereographic (equal angle) projections of the lower hemisphere. A misorientation angle of 10\u00b0 was used as a threshold limit value for grain detection. The 3D orientation of kink band boundaries and twin boundaries was measured by a universal tilting stage (U-stage) mounted on a polarized light microscope and compared to the EBSD-measurements to index the crystallographic orientation of the planes.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSamples\nThe investigated amphibole-rich gneisses (Fig. 1b\u2013d) contain about 60\u201380 % amphibole, 20\u201340 % plagioclase (oligoclase), 10\u201320 % quartz and 0\u20135 % biotite. Accessory constituents include sphene, ilmenite and zircon. The green hornblendes are calcic amphiboles (Na, K)0.3\n\u2013\n0.6(Ca, Mn)2(Mg2.2Fe1.8Al)(Si7Al)O22(OH)2 with a Mg# between 0.5 and 0.6, space group C 2\/m. There is no systematic intracrystalline variation in chemical composition within deformed amphibole grains. The amphibole grain size varies with long axes around 100\u2013800\u00a0\u03bcm. Quartz-rich (> 90 % quartz) layers concordant to the foliation of the gneisses are typically a few cm to dm wide (Fig. 1b-d). The amphibole-rich gneisses also show boudinaged layers when in contact to quartz-rich lithologies (Fig. 1c). Pseudotachylytes in the investigated samples commonly show vein geometries of a few \u03bcm to several mm (Figs. 1c, d and 2a-f). In amphibole-rich layers, they show a fine-grained matrix containing rounded clasts of mainly amphibole (< 1\u00a0\u03bcm to several \u03bcm in diameter) and in decreasing abundance feldspar, sphene, ilmenite and quartz (Fig. 2c-f). Yet, the composition of the pseudotachylytes varies strongly dependent on the local host lithology. For a detailed description of the different types of pseudotachylytes and host gneisses, the reader is referred to Koch and Masch (1992) and Schmutz (1995).\n\n\n4.2\nAmphibole microfabrics\nAmphibole shows undulatory extinction, lamellar mechanical twins, kink bands and microcracks (Fig. 2a, b) commonly associated with pseudotachylytes (Fig. 2c-f). Two different lamellar twins are observed (Fig. 3\n). Most common are (\u2212101)[101] twins, characterized with EBSD-analysis in combination with U-stage measurements by the (\u2212101) twin plane, rotation axes parallel to [101] and a misorientation angle of 180\u00b0. The (\u2212101)[101] twins typically display a width of 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm and a spacing of 20\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm (Figs. 3; 4a-b; 5a and 6). The highest observed twin density is about 0.15\/\u03bcm. The (\u2212101)[101] twins characteristically deflect the {110} cleavage planes (Fig. 2g). Less common are (100)[001] twins, characterized by the (100) twin plane, rotation axes parallel to [001] and a misorientation angle of 180\u00b0 (Figs. 3 and 6a-c). The (100)[001] twins typically show widths of about 20\u00a0\u03bcm and a larger spacing, compared to the (\u2212101)[101] twins. The (100)[001] twins appear to cross cut the (\u2212101)[101] twins (Fig. 3c). In association with twinned amphiboles, pseudotachylyte veins occur containing fine-clastic (3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) amphibole (compare Figs. 2e, f and 4a green-rimmed area) with almost random crystallographic orientations, as indicated by the polefigures (Fig. 4f), density plots (multiple of uniform distribution < 2) (Fig. 4g) and misorientation angle distribution (Fig. 4e).\n\n\nKink bands are observed with boundaries parallel to (010), where the poles of the kink band boundaries are parallel to the \nb\n-axis of the amphibole measured by U-stage (Figs. 2b and 5). Generally, kink bands are characterized by the curvature of the crystal, which is concentrated into well-defined sharp regions, i.e. kink band boundaries, separating regions of the crystal with different orientation (usually \u2265 10\u00b0 misorientation angle) that are not curved (Nicolas and Poirier, 1976). The kink bands observed here, show misorientation angles between 15 and 30\u00b0 relative to the host amphibole and a rotation axis scattering around [001] (Fig. 5). They occur as single kink bands (Fig. 4b) or lamellar with a width of about 10\u00a0\u03bcm and spacing of 40\u201370\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 5). The kink bands appear to crosscut the (\u2212101)[101] twins (Fig. 5a, d). There is no systematic chemical variation associated with the kink band or the twin boundaries.\nBoth twins mostly show straight boundaries (Figs. 3b, c and 4a, b) if not affected by kink bands (Fig. 5a, d). Rarely, the twin boundaries are sutured (Fig. 6). The sutures are characterized by wavelengths and amplitudes of few \u03bcm and they are not associated with a second phase or any chemical gradients (Fig. 6e). Microfaults occur parallel to (001) (Fig. 7a), in addition to {110} cleavage fractures (Figs. 4b, c; 5d, e and 7a, c). The undulatory extinction observed in the polarized light microscope (Figs. 2a, b and 3a) is characterized via EBSD by domains with relative misorientation angles up to 30\u201340\u00b0 (Figs. 4b, d; 5a and 7). However, both, the relative misorientation (Fig. 7a) as well as the local misorientation for angles < 5\u00b0 and a kernel size of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 (Fig. 7b), indicate that the misorientations are mostly related to fractures. The orientations of the fine-grained (3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) new grains along the microfaults scatter largely around the crystallographic orientation of the host crystal (Fig. 7d). Rotation axes are almost randomly oriented, especially for the dominating misorientation angles < 90\u00b0 (Fig. 7e). The rotation axes for the less frequent misorientation angles > 90\u00b0 show a weak clustering around the plane normal of (001), which coincides with the orientation of one dominating crack plane of the host (Fig. 7c).\n\n\n4.3\nQuartz microfabrics\n\n4.3.1\nQuartz in spatial relation to twinned amphibole and pseudotachylytes\nQuartz in spatial relation to twinned amphibole and pseudotachylytes in the gneisses typically shows a grain size of several hundred \u03bcm to mm, short wavelength undulatory extinction (SWUE) and subbasal deformation lamellae (Fig. 8a-c). SWUE is characterized by lamellar domains subparallel to {10\u221211} rhombohedral planes with misorientation angles of 0\u201325\u00b0 (Fig. 8c, d). Along rhombohedral planes, fine recrystallized grains with a diameter of < 15\u00a0\u03bcm occur (Fig. 8a, d-g). The orientation of these new grains display crystallographic orientations similar to that of the host (Fig. 8e, f). However, also grain orientations that largely deviate from that of the host grain occur, as shown also by the misorientation angle distribution histogram (Fig. 8g).\n\n\n4.3.2\nQuartz rich layers\nQuartz rich layers with > 90 % quartz that contain some plagioclase (5\u201315 %) with grain diameters of about (50\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm) and amphibole (ca. 5 %) occur concordant to the foliation of the amphibole gneisses (Fig. 1c, d). Quartz in these layers is showing quite different microstructures (Figs. 9 and 10\n\n). Mostly the quartz is recrystallized with homogeneous aggregates showing a marked crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) (Figs. 9 and 10). The distribution and recrystallized grain size within the different samples, however, varies strongly. We distinguish two different \u201cendmembers\u201d. A type-A microstructure shows a relatively coarse recrystallized grain size of ~ 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014\u00a0\u03bcm and a homogenous distribution with no systematic change towards the lithological contact to the amphibole rich layer (Fig. 9). There, the CPO is characterized by [c]-axes preferentially oriented in two maxima along the \nyz\n-plane of the gneisses and\u00a0<a>\u2212axes at about 30\u00b0 to the stretching lineation (\nx\n-axis) (Fig. 9g). Transgranular fractures and cataclastic zones can cut through the recrystallized quartz grains (Fig. 9a-c). The type-B microstructure is characterized by a finer grain size of ~ 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0\u03bcm and a decreasing number of recrystallized grains towards the contact to amphibole-gneisses (Fig. 10). There, the CPO of the large porphyroclasts is showing [c]-axes close to the hemisphere, whereas the [c]-axis of recrystallized grains are rather close to the \ny\n-axis of the gneisses (Fig. 10g, h). The <a>\u2212axes are preferentially oriented in a plane about 45\u00b0 to the foliation and about 90\u00b0 to the girdle maximum of the [c]-axes (Fig. 10g, h). The rotation axes show the same characteristics for both types of microstructures with a preferred orientation parallel <a>\u00a0for misorientation angles below 70\u00b0 and parallel poles to {r} and {z} rhombohedra for misorientation angles > 70\u00b0 (Figs. 9h and 10i). The strong maximum parallel <c>\u00a0at 50\u201370\u00b0 (multiple of uniform distribution > 40) is related to Dauphin\u00e9 twin domains. The preferred rotation axes parallel <a>\u00a0and poles to {r} and {z} rhombohedra for the other misorientation angles indicates <a>\u00a0dislocation glide (e.g. Kilian and Heilbronner, 2017). In both types of microstructure, porphyroclasts show subgrains with similar shape and size compared to the recrystallized grains (Figs. 9d, e and 10e, f).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nHigh-stress deformation of amphibole\nThe (\u2212101)[101] twin system of amphiboles is known from high-stress experiments (Buck, 1970; Morrison-Smith, 1976; Rooney et al., 1975; Rooney et al., 1970; Wilks and Carter, 1990) and has rarely been reported from naturally deformed rocks, either related to pseudotachylytes (Rooney et al., 1975; Sobott, 1979), or from meteorite impact craters \/ related to nuclear explosions (Borg, 1972; Chao, 1967). (100) twins are observed more commonly from various fault rocks, including mylonites (Baratoux et al., 2005; Biermann, 1981; Cao et al., 2010; Cumbest et al., 1989; Kenkmann, 2000). Both types of twins are related to glide of partial dislocations 1\/2 [00\u22121] in (100) octahedral layers (Hacker and Christie, 1990; Kirby and Christie, 1977; Rooney et al., 1975). A critical resolved shear stress on the order of 200\u2013400\u00a0MPa has been inferred for nucleation and propagation of (\u2212101)[101] twins in deformation experiments in a solid medium Griggs-type deformation apparatus on single amphibole crystals by Rooney et al. (1970). According to the Schmid formula (1), a differential stress (\u03c3d) of twice the critical resolved shear stress (\u03c4CRSS) is required to twin a crystal in the most suitable orientation for twinning (i.e., at a Schmid factor of 0.5). Considering the uncertainty of the experimental calibration of the critical resolved shear stress on the one hand and the fact that twinned amphiboles are widespread and occur also in grains at different crystallographic orientations (i.e. also at somewhat lower Schmid factors), 400\u00a0MPa is a conservative lower bound for the differential stress.\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c3\nd\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\nCRSS\n\n\/\n\n\ncos\u03b3\n\u00b7\ncos\u03b8\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b3 and \u03b8 are the angles between \u03c31 and the twin plane normal (\u2212101) and the glide direction [101], respectively.\n(100)[001] is generally assumed to be the most effective glide system, because it does not require to break the relatively strong covalent SiO bonds (e.g., Nicolas and Poirier, 1976). Dislocation glide of amphibole with [001] burgers vectors has been indicated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Biermann, 1981; Cumbest, 1988; Morrison-Smith, 1976; Rooney et al., 1975). Biermann and Van Roermund (1983) observed planar defect structures parallel to (010) bound by partial [001] screw dislocations in clinoamphiboles naturally deformed at 450\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C. Additionally, kink bands with boundaries normal to [001] and rotation axes of [010] have been taken as evidence for (100)[001] dislocation glide (Dollinger and Blacic, 1975; Wilks and Carter, 1990). The kink bands observed here, however, show boundaries perpendicular to [010] and the rotation axis is scattering around [001] (Figs. 4b, c and 5a, b). Kinking is commonly found in crystals with only one glide plane, when no effective glide on this system is geometrically possible and when the shortening direction is at low angles to the glide plane (Nicolas and Poirier, 1976). Kink band boundaries are, therefore, significantly different to subgrain boundaries that are generated by the arrangement of geometrically necessary dislocations, requiring both, effective dislocation glide and climb, i.e. recovery, and subgrain boundaries have lower misorientation angles of < 10\u00b0. The formation of kink bands involves glide of dislocations with directions roughly perpendicular to the kink band boundary, where the glide plane is defined by the glide direction and the external axis of rotation (e.g., Christie et al., 1964; Nicolas and Poirier, 1976; Raleigh, 1968). Therefore, the observed kink bands indicate (100)[010] glide. (100)[010] glide is only possible with partial dislocations of Burgers vectors 1\/x[010] and at high resolved shear stresses, as the dislocation energy is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the Burgers vector, which is with ~ 18\u00a0\u00c5 for [010] in clinoamphiboles very high (e.g., Hacker and Christie, 1990).\nTwining and kinking as dislocation glide-controlled deformation mechanisms occur together with microfracturing, cataclasis and the formation of pseudotachylytes (Figs. 2c-g; 3a and 4). The fine-grained amphibole present within pseudotachylyte veins (Figs. 2e, f and 4a) is interpreted to be predominantly due to cataclasis given their distribution and almost random crystallographic orientation (Fig. 4f, g). Also, the new grains along microfractures with a CPO controlled by the host (Fig. 7a, b) with almost randomly oriented rotation axes (Fig. 7d, e) are interpreted to be predominantly due to cataclasis, as a major contribution of dislocation glide to their formation is not evident. The observed relative misorientation between larger fragments (Fig. 7a, b) is indicating rigid body rotation related to microfracturing, as opposed to a relative misorientation related to subgrains generated by recovery. Low angle grain boundaries are not observed. Therefore, no major contribution of dislocation climb and recovery is apparent from the amphibole microstructures.\nThe locally observed sutured twin boundaries (Fig. 6) indicate that the boundaries migrated after twinning. As no secondary phase or any systematic chemical difference is apparent along the twin boundaries, the driving force for the migration is likely a strain gradient. This implies a stage of deformation by dislocation glide at which different amounts of geometrically necessary dislocations were produced in the twins compared to the host crystal given their different crystallographic orientation. Strain-induced migration of twin boundaries is commonly observed in calcite (Burkhard, 1993). For amphiboles, Cao et al. (2010) interpreted new grains to develop from strain-induced twin-boundary migration and suggested the term \u201ctwinning nucleation recrystallization\u201d.\nApart from this local indication of strain-induced grain boundary migration after twinning, no evidence of amphibole deformation by dislocation creep (dislocation glide associated with recovery and recrystallization) is apparent. This is consistent with the general observation that amphibole is deforming by dislocation creep only at pressure-temperature conditions markedly above greenschist-facies conditions (e.g. Biermann and Van Roermund, 1983; Brodie and Rutter, 1985; Cumbest et al., 1989; D\u00edaz Aspiroz et al., 2007; Hacker and Christie, 1990; Kruse and St\u00fcnitz, 1999; Skrotzki, 1992). The deformation related to the pseudotachylyte formation in the Silvretta is constrained to be at greenschist-facies conditions given the mineral assemblage in the pseudotachylytes with stilpnomelan and amphibole (Bachmann et al., 2009; Koch, 1990; Koch and Masch, 1992; Masch, 1970; Schmutz, 1995).\nTaken together, the ubiquitous (\u2212101)[101] twins and (010) kink bands of amphibole indicate high-stress dislocation glide-controlled deformation together with microcracking. The pseudotachylytes indicate associated cataclasis with comminution and fusion. A subsequent stage of dislocation glide and strain-induced twin-boundary migration is recorded by sutured twin boundaries.\n\n\n5.2\nHigh-stress dislocation glide-controlled deformation of quartz\nThe quartz microcracks, sub-basal deformation lamellae and SWUE, as well as the strings of tiny quartz grains along {10\u201311} cleavage planes occur exclusively in spatial relation to twinned amphibole and pseudotachylytes (Figs. 8 and 9) and are not spatially related to the quartz-amphibole-gneiss contact (Fig. 10a). Therefore, these quartz microstructures are interpreted to have formed coeval with the high-stress deformation of amphibole and pseudotachylytes. The formation of fine-grained quartz aggregates in direct vicinity to pseudotachylytes has been interpreted to result from dynamic recrystallization at frictionally generated thermal pulses (Bestmann et al., 2012; Bestmann et al., 2011). Sub-basal deformation lamellae, SWUE, together with strings of new grains along highly-damaged zones in a host grain are reported to be characteristic of transient high-stress dislocation glide-controlled deformation of quartz at greenschist facies conditions during coseismic deformation and subsequent modification at decreasing stresses during postseismic creep - also without involvement of frictional melts (Trepmann et al., 2013; Trepmann et al., 2007; Trepmann and St\u00f6ckhert, 2013; Trepmann and St\u00f6ckhert, 2003). Consistently, the new grains here are interpreted to be due to growth from highly damaged zones along intragranular fractures that were initially generated at high-stress dislocation glide-controlled deformation.\n\n\n5.3\nDislocation creep of quartz\nDespite the varying distribution and size of recrystallized quartz, represented by the type-A and type-B quartz microstructures, both show evidence of dislocation creep, i.e. dislocation glide associated with dynamic recovery and recrystallization, by relatively homogenous aggregates of recrystallized quartz with marked CPO indicating <a>\u2212glide (Figs. 9 and 10; e.g., Hirth and Tullis, 1992; Kilian and Heilbronner, 2017; Stipp and Tullis, 2003). In few larger remnants, the similar size and shape of subgrains compared to the recrystallized grains suggest subgrain rotation recrystallization (e.g., Hobbs, 1968; Stipp and Kunze, 2008; Urai et al., 1986), which allows to apply the recrystallization paleopiezometer by Stipp and Tullis (2003). The grain size of ~ 30\u00a0\u03bcm for the type-A microstructure (Fig. 9) and the ~ 10\u00a0\u03bcm for the type-B microstructure (Fig. 10) indicate differential stresses of ~ 45\u00a0MPa and\u00a0~\u00a0100\u00a0MPa, respectively. Markedly, the coarser type-A microstructure recording the lower flow stress is also showing a more homogeneous distribution of recrystallized grains with no gradient towards the amphibole-rich gneisses (Fig. 9). In contrast, the finer-grained recrystallized microstructure is showing a decreasing number of recrystallized grains towards the contact to the amphibole-rich gneiss, where large porphyroclasts are preserved (Fig. 10). Transgranular fractures cut through the recrystallized quartz microfabric with related cataclasis of quartz (Fig. 9a-c). Thus, we interpret the different dislocation creep microstructures to represent a separate stage, predating both, pseudotachylyte formation and the related high-stress dislocation glide-controlled deformation of quartz and amphibole in the amphibole-rich gneisses.\nThe temperature-pressure conditions during dislocation creep of quartz are assumed to be about the same conditions as for pseudotachylyte formation, i.e., greenschist facies conditions, given the mineral assemblage in the pseudotachylytes with stilpnomelan and amphibole on one hand and the general Alpine greenschist facies metamorphic conditions of the Silvretta crystalline on the other (Bachmann et al., 2009; Koch, 1990; Koch and Masch, 1992; Masch, 1970; Schmutz, 1995). Therefore, the different quartz deformation behavior in the amphibole-rich layers associated to the pseudotachylytes, as well as the differences in the type-A and type-B microstructures in the quartz-rich layers cannot be mainly controlled by different ambient temperature-pressure conditions.\nA stage of creep preceding a stage of high-stress deformation at constant PT-conditions is commonly taken to indicate stress concentrations due to the viscosity contrast of rigid blocks in a weak matrix causing the formation of pseudotachylytes at depth below the seismogenic zone (e.g., Campbell et al., 2020; Hawemann et al., 2019; Papa et al., 2020). During the stage of dislocation creep in the quartz-rich layers, amphibole-rich layers are interpreted to have acted as rigid inclusion in a weak matrix, which might have induced some stress-strain concentrations, for example resulting in the formation of the observed boudinage of the amphibole-rich gneisses (Fig. 1c). Depending on the relative volumes, the amphibole-rich gneisses, locally even resulted in a \u201dstrain shadow\u201d within quartz-rich layers with lower amount of recrystallized grains at the direct contact (Figs. 10 and 11\n). If this documented mechanical contrast would have resulted in the formation of pseudotachylytes, we would expect (1) an increasing number of recrystallized grains and decreasing grain size towards the lithological contact and (2) the direct spatially related occurrence of pseudotachylytes. Yet, we observe neither a strain gradient with increasing numbers of dynamically recrystallized quartz grains towards the amphibole-rich gneisses (rather the opposite, Figs. 10 and 11), nor a spatial relationship between the recrystallized quartz microstructure and pseudotachylytic and cataclastic zones associated with twinned amphibole. Therefore, the preceding stage of dislocation creep in the quartz-rich lithologies observed here cannot explain the high differential stresses recorded by the amphibole and quartz microstructures within the amphibole-rich gneisses and the associated pseudotachylyte formation.\n\n\n5.4\nDeformation controlled by the distance to the thrust fault\nThe different microstructures in the pseudotachylyte-bearing amphibole-rich layers as well as that in the type-A and type-B microstructures in the quartz-rich layers at the same pressure-temperature conditions can also not be explained by the different lithology alone, as discussed above. We suggest that the difference in deformation behavior is controlled by the different distance to the tip of the seismogenic zone, following the model by N\u00fcchter et al. (2013) (Fig. 11). During the detachment of a large crystalline nappe, as the Silvretta nappe, incremental fault growth with related stress concentrations at the fault tip need to be considered (e.g., Cowie and Scholz, 1992; Pollard and Segall, 1987; Stein et al., 1988; Walsh and Watterson, 1988). Therefore, the model of N\u00fcchter et al. (2013) proposed for a given observation site, i.e., the investigated rock sample, a characteristic sequence of different deformation microstructures at decreasing distance to the propagating thrust fault. Following this model, we suggest that the different microstructures represent deformation at more or less constant depths, yet at different distances to the propagating tip of the basal thrust fault during detachment of the Silvretta nappe (Fig. 11). For decreasing distance, this would include:\n\n1)\nQuartz dislocation creep-dominated stages at stresses from a few tens of MPa (type-A microstructure with relatively coarse grain diameters and homogeneous distribution of recrystallized grains) to hundred of MPa (type-B microstructure with fine-grained recrystallized aggregates and \u201cstrain-shadow\u201d at the contact to the amphibole-rich layer). The higher the distance to the seismic active fault, the more distributed the deformation. During this long-term creep, quartz-rich layers accumulate the higher amount of strain in relation to the amphibole-rich gneisses, consistent with a lower flow strength of quartz related to dislocation creep (e.g., Gleason and Tullis, 1995; Hirth et al., 2001; Luan and Paterson, 1992) as opposed to amphibole (e.g., Berger and St\u00fcnitz, 1996; Brodie and Rutter, 1985; Cao et al., 2010; D\u00edaz Aspiroz et al., 2007; Imon et al., 2004; Shelley, 1994).\n\n\n2)\nDislocation glide-controlled deformation of quartz is preferentially occurring in coarse quartz grains as opposed to the fine-grained recrystallized aggregates consistent with the inverse relationship between strength and grain size during dislocation glide, where grain boundaries act as obstacles (e.g., Fredrich et al., 1990; Hall, 1951; Hirth, 1972; Petch, 1953). This dislocation-glide controlled deformation of quartz is directly related to twinned amphibole, as well as cataclastic and pseudotachylytic zones. Given the lower fracture toughness, the higher shear modulus and lower melting temperature in relation to quartz, amphibole is preferentially responding by comminution and fusion (e.g., Spray, 2010). Therefore, the observation that pseudotachylytes are more common in the amphibole-rich gneisses containing coarse quartz indicates that they represent the \u201cweak\u201d lithology and the finer-grained recrystallized quartz layers represent relatively the \u201cstronger\u201d lithology during the high-stress, high strain-rate deformation that caused the formation of pseudotachylytes.\n\n\n\nThe heterogeneous microstructures of preserved coarse quartz aggregates on one hand and twinned amphibole indicating high-stress conditions \u2265 400\u00a0MPa at the same PT conditions on the other, require transient high-stress conditions characterized by fast stress-loading rates and rapidly decreasing stresses (Trepmann et al., 2017; Trepmann and Seybold, 2019). Such high stresses during the pseudotachylyte-forming stage are well consistent to the stresses inferred by jadeite twins from metagranites in the Sesia zone, which were related to coseismic deformation (Trepmann and St\u00f6ckhert, 2001). The deformation records of twinned clinoamphiboles and clinopyroxenes are ideal to detect transient peak stresses during coseismic deformation, as the characteristic microstructures are neither masked by preceding nor by subsequent stages of deformation at lower stresses, as the case for quartz, for example. They offer the unique possibility to constrain the close to peak stress conditions controlling seismic faulting at depth of the base of seismogenic zone, not directly accessible for in-situ stress measurements.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe different microstructures are controlled by the distance to the tip of the propagating basal thrust fault during detachment of the Silvretta nappe.\nAt low distances to the fault:\n\n\u2022\nStresses of \u2265 400\u00a0MPa are indicated by (\u2212101)[101] mechanical twins in amphibole.\n\n\n\u2022\nAmphibole twinning and kinking occur together with cataclasis and pseudotachylyte formation as well as dislocation-glide controlled deformation of quartz.

Amongst the exposed paleo-plate boundaries, the Insubric Line is unique as it represents a particularly well-preserved suture zone documenting the late continental collision stage of the Alpine orogeny (e.g., Schmid et al., 1987). As such, the Insubric Line separates the Austroalpine gneiss units of the Sesia Zone to the west from Adriatic lower crustal rocks exposed in the Ivrea-Verbano Zone (IVZ) to the east. The IVZ is associated with a very prominent positive gravity anomaly (e.g., Berckhemer, 1968; Kissling, 1984; Scarponi et al., 2020) and an associated seismic high-velocity anomaly (e.g., Diehl et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2018), whose origins extend to shallow crustal levels. This so-called Ivrea Geophysical Body (IGB) is assumed to represent a sliver of Adriatic lower crust and upper mantle, which was \u201cupwarped\u201d in the course of the continental collision process (e.g., Schmid et al., 2017). The IVZ thus corresponds to a partial exposure of the IGB.\nThe geology of the IVZ has been extensively studied, as it is widely regarded to represent arguably the most complete exhumed cross-section of the lower continental crust and its transition into the uppermost mantle (e.g., Fountain, 1976; Schmid et al., 1996; Quick et al., 2003; Brack et al., 2010) (Fig. 1\n). As a consequence, the IVZ is a prime locality to gain insights into the composition, structure, and evolution of this critically important, but still largely enigmatic part of the continental lithosphere. These questions will be addressed in a unified and focused manner in the framework of an international research project called DIVE (Drilling the Ivrea-Verbano zonE) (Pistone et al., 2017), which recently has been approved by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). A\u00a0~4-km-deep borehole is planned just east of the Insubric Line near Balmuccia, where the deepest parts of the lower continental crust have been exhumed. To locate and orient this borehole, and to develop an effective drilling, sampling, and logging strategy, the targeted subsurface region needs to be geophysically characterized. This is generally best achieved through seismic reflection surveys, which are indeed widely regarded as a conditio sine qua non for drilling campaigns in general and ICDP projects in particular (e.g., Demirel-Schlueter et al., 2005; Juhlin et al., 2010; Simon and Buske, 2017). To this end, we have carried out high-resolution seismic reflection measurements across the Insubric Line from the Sesia Zone into the IVZ near the planned DIVE drilling location at Balmuccia. The primary objective of this seismic survey is to clarify whether the sub-vertical structures prevailing at the surface can be expected to be continuous throughout the uppermost crust, that is, to a depth of ~1\u00a0km, or whether there is evidence of major structural flattening or fault-related offsets.\nThe sub-vertical surficial structures and the high seismic velocities associated with the crystalline rocks present in DIVE's target zone differ strikingly from the layered sedimentary environments, for which the seismic reflection method was originally designed. While seismic reflection profiling has demonstrated significant potential in complex crystalline environments, the acquisition and processing need to be tuned to the corresponding targets, which tend to be non-specular, small-scale, and complex (e.g., Eaton et al., 2003; Malehmir et al., 2012). Correspondingly, the interpretation of the resulting unconventional seismic images is notoriously challenging and tends to lend itself to modelling-based approaches (e.g., Bongajum et al., 2012). In view of this, we have made efforts to acquire seismic reflection data with high spatial and temporal resolution as well as high redundancy, and we geared the processing flow towards enhancing weak seismic events backscattered from complex, non-specular heterogeneities associated with the prevailing sub-vertical structural grain. For the interpretation, we complement the conventional qualitative visual assessment of crustal seismic reflection images with numerical simulations as well as with attribute and geostatistical analyses.\n\n\n2\nDatabase\nSteeply dipping structures are inherently difficult to image with surface-based seismic reflection surveys, as specular interfaces with dips in excess of ~70 degrees generally do not return any seismic energy back to the surface (e.g., Juhlin et al., 2000). A possibility to address this problem is to focus on the energy backscattered from small-scale, non-specular heterogeneities associated with larger-scale structures (e.g., Schmelzbach et al., 2008; Tertyshnikov et al., 2015; Khoshnavaz et al., 2016; Schwarz and Krawczyk, 2020). Correspondingly, our acquisition and processing strategies are geared towards collecting high-fold seismic profiles with high spatial and temporal resolution, such that weak backscattered seismic energy can be effectively recorded and enhanced through targeted signal processing and wavefield separation techniques (e.g., Salisbury et al., 2000; Eaton et al., 2003; Schijns et al., 2009; Malehmir and Juhlin, 2010; Juhlin et al., 2010).\nThe three seismic lines presented in this study, denoted as L1, L2, and L3, were collected along the Boccioleto-Balmuccia and Balmuccia-Isola roads (Fig. 2a). The acquisition and processing methodologies for all three lines are largely identical. In the following, we focus on the data acquired along L1, which crosses from the Sesia Zone in the west into the Insubric Line in the east, because it exemplarily illustrates our methodological approach, quasi-perpendicularly crosses some of the most pertinent structures, and has a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio (S\/N) than L2 and L3.\n\n2.1\nAcquisition\nThe data were acquired using a 400\u00a0kg weight-drop source (Fig. 2b) in conjunction with 15\u00a0Hz vertical-component geophones and a GEODE distributed seismograph system. The acquisition parameters are listed in Fig. 2c. The receiver geometry consisted of a geophone spread with 144 live channels with 5\u00a0m station spacing. The receiver spread was rolled along every 24 stations, except for L1, which consisted of a single 48-station roll-on that resulted in a two-spread geometry as shown in Fig. 3a. The source stations were collocated with receiver stations, that is, every 5\u00a0m for L1 and L2, which resulted in a dense array of common mid-points or CMPs (Fig. 3b) with a nominal spacing of 2.5\u00a0m and a fold of 77 for the 144 live receivers. This fold was increased in the centre of L1 by having overlapping receiver spreads (Fig. 3c). For L3, the source increment had to be increased to 10\u00a0m due to time limitations, which corresponds to a nominal fold of 36. The Boccioleto-Balmuccia road section of L1 is only mildly crooked, such that all CMP locations fall within a 30-m-wide swath of the central trend line. Geophones were planted alongside the road and over embankments. Where outcropping solid rock prevented this, 8-mm-diameter holes were drilled into the concrete verge of the road to plant the geophones. Consequently, some receiver station elevations were not vertically collocated with the sources (Fig. 3d), which resulted in erratic first-arrival times (Fig. 4a).\nThe 400\u00a0kg weight-drop source provided signals with a dominant frequency of ~80\u00a0Hz (Fig. 4b) and had sufficient energy to reach far-offset receivers, except for the westernmost (~1\u201330) source positions. In these field records, the first-arriving seismic energy was weak for the easternmost receivers. Lateral variations in signal quality and strength can be seen from west to east in the example field records shown in Fig. 4a, for example, between the dashed vertical white lines. These variations are likely caused by surficial geological variations across the profile and are assumed to be the primary reason for the source energy barely reaching the most distant receivers. This resulted in data with relatively low S\/N recorded at these distant channels until the source progressed passed position 30. Additionally, the operation of the weight-drop source was associated with an uncontrollable \u201cbounce\u201d, which resulted in ghost shots with onsets at ~300\u2013400\u00a0ms. However, due to the high seismic velocities of the study area, these ghost shots, for the most part, do not affect the travel time interval of interest ranging from 0 to ~300\u00a0ms. A prominent example of such a ghost shot is shown in Fig. 4a.\n\n\n2.2\nProcessing\nTopographic elevation variations and low-velocity alluvial and\/or weathering layers close to the surface are known to significantly distort reflections in hardrock seismic surveys (e.g., Palmer and Jones, 2005; Urosevic and Juhlin, 2007). To alleviate this problem, static corrections were performed prior to pre-stack processing. Firstly, receiver elevation statics were applied to reduce the receivers to a common source-receiver datum corresponding to the Boccioleto-Balmuccia road. Following this, subsurface velocity variations were evaluated using refracted ray travel-time tomography (Fig. 5\n). The tomographic approach was preferred over standard refraction seismic techniques, such as the plus-minus method (Hagedoorn, 1959) or the generalized reciprocal method (Palmer and Jones, 2005), due to the pronounced lateral velocity variations along the profile, which are clearly observable in the first-arrival travel-time curves (Fig. 5a). Static correction times at each receiver location were computed using the inferred surficial velocity structure (Fig. 5b) down to a depth of 20\u00a0m (Fig. 5c and d), and then applied to the data (Fig. 5e and f).\nFollowing these static corrections, a targeted seismic reflection processing flow was applied, which is summarized in Fig. 6\n and the most essential parts of which are outlined in the following. Conditioning of the pre-stack data involved band-pass filtering (10\u201320\u201385-100\u00a0Hz) to subdue the airwave, which has a dominant frequency of ~100\u00a0Hz, and the subsequent application of spiking deconvolution to balance and enhance the spectral characteristics of data (Fig. 6a). Spiking deconvolution was successful in boosting the central frequency of the data to ~80\u00a0Hz, which corresponds to the upper limit of the previously applied band-pass filter. A non-standard technique was used to remove the direct arrivals and their associated reverberations (Fig. 6b). This was achieved using a 2D alpha-trimmed median filter, which required the flattening of the first-arrivals and the reversal of this procedure after filtering (e.g., Greenwood et al., 2019; Caspari et al., 2020). Please note that this filter also naturally removes the P-wave component of the ghost shots. S-waves, including those associated with the ghost shots, and groundroll were removed using a polygon-type f-k filter. Examples of the pre-stack processing of shot records are shown in Fig. 6c. Here, we see little to no evidence of continuous hyperbolic reflection events that might be associated with shallow gently to moderately dipping structures. Conversely, we see many features that are cross-cutting each other in a chevron-type manner with similar move-outs as the first-arrivals. These opposing dips are analogous to those observed for reflections in VSP data with a vertical receiver line crossing horizontal structures, which represents the transpose to our survey geometry and the prevailing geological structures (Fig. 6a through 6c).\nAfter static corrections, removal of unwanted wavefield components, and CMP-sorting, a corresponding stacked section can be produced. This requires a velocity model to correct for the normal move-out (NMO). NMO velocity analysis is typically based on the assumption of quasi-hyperbolic move-out associated with a layered subsurface structure. However, in complex, steeply dipping environments, this kind of analysis is not meaningful. Therefore, we visually analysed constant-velocity CMP stacks to determine the stacking velocity, which optimally enhanced the overall strength and coherence of the backscattered seismic energy. While this process is inherently subjective, our key observation was that, while the apexes of the backscattered events changed in time as a function of the stacking velocity, their strength and coherency remained largely constant. Ultimately, we decided on a single, constant stacking velocity of 7000\u00a0m\/s, which is broadly consistent with evidence from laboratory measurements (e.g., Fountain, 1976). In this context, it is important to note that the use of constant or quasi-constant stacking velocities is quite common in hardrock seismic exploration in response to the small move-outs prevailing in high-velocity crystalline environments (e.g., Eaton et al., 2003).\nThe resulting stacked section of L1 unsurprisingly does not exhibit any prominent events (Fig. 6d) and, hence, there are also no laterally continuous reflections that could be associated with gently to moderately dipping structures. Conversely, there are many cross-cutting, moderately dipping events, which show coherence over a few traces. These short and discontinuous seismic events, which are quite typical of hardrock environments, are likely to represent seismic energy backscattered from small-scale heterogeneities (e.g., Holliger, 1997; Eaton et al., 2003; Bongajum et al., 2012). There are also weak side reflections coming from ~100\u00a0m east of the profile that are back-reflected within the profile at ~750\u00a0m (Fig. 6d). These events are interpreted as VSP-type reflections associated with direct waves being reflected from sub-vertical structures. Finally, imaging and subsequent time-to-depth conversion of the data was performed using Kirchhoff post-stack time migration with a constant velocity of 7000\u00a0m\/s. In accordance with the presumed backscattered energy present in the stacked section, a small migration aperture of 100\u00a0m was used. While the use of a small migration aperture limits the proper imaging of steeply dipping specular reflections, this approach was deemed appropriate due to the absence of such signal characteristics in the stacked data. In turn, this allows to effectively focus the backscattered seismic events and, at the same time, to reduce artefacts, that is, \u201csmiling\u201d effects, in the imaged data. The VSP-type reflections observed in the CMP stack are also visible in the migrated section (Fig. 6e).\nPrior to migration there are pervasive, steeply dipping coherent noise events observable throughout the stacked data. The apparent velocity of this noise is ~2000\u00a0m\/s, thus eliminating the possibility of it being P-waves reflected from vertical boundaries, which would manifest themselves with an apparent velocity of ~3500\u00a0m\/s. Conversely, the linear move-out of this coherent noise is consistent with an S-wave velocity of ~4000\u00a0m\/s, which is realistic in the given context. Interpreting this steeply dipping coherent noise as backscattered S-waves and\/or groundroll is also consistent with the work of Chopra and Marfurt (2014). Due to their steep dips, these events remain unaffected by migration, which was confirmed by testing migration velocities between 2800 and 7000\u00a0m\/s specifically for this purpose. To obtain a cleaner final image, we therefore applied a targeted f-k fan filter to the stacked section prior to migration. Extensive tests with varying filter designs demonstrated that this process is robust and largely devoid of artefacts. Weak, yet pervasive, VSP-type side reflections are still present after migration and cut through the section as shown by the red and yellow lines in Fig. 6e.\nThe processing flow of L1 outlined above, was also used for seismic lines L2 and L3, and the corresponding stacked and imaged sections are shown in Fig. 7a and b, and Fig. 7c and d, respectively. L2 runs oblique to the geological strike (Fig. 2) and had an active river gravel quarry operating at its eastern bound. Consequently, the data contained strong and abundant cultural noise, which required very rigorous trace editing. For this reason, the effective average fold of L2 was reduced to ~50 with regard to its original nominal value of 77. The course of L3 is strongly crooked, running sub-parallel to strike (Fig. 2) and on top of Quaternary sediments for the first ~200\u00a0m (Fig. 7b). As mentioned above, the shot spacing for L3 had to be increased to 10\u00a0m, which reduced its nominal fold to 36. In spite of their lower fold and lower S\/N, the overall character of the stacked (Fig. 7a and b) and migrated (Fig. 7c and d) sections of L2 and L3 rather closely resembles that of L1 (Fig. 6d and e).\n\n\n\n3\nInterpretation\nThe resulting stacks and migrated images of all three seismic lines are devoid of laterally coherent reflectors (Figs. 6 and 7), which is consistent with little to no energy being reflected to the surface from larger-scale, specular-type structures. This, in turn, indicates that the Insubric Line, as well as its associated secondary structures, are likely to remain sub-vertical within the subsurface region imaged by our seismic survey. This first-order assessment is consistent with the fact that the migrated and depth-converted images of L1, L2 and L3, are characterized by local bright lineaments, which subtly change in dip and seem to align sub-vertically. As such, these events could represent the apexes of seismic energy backscattered from local heterogeneities associated with the prevailing larger-scale sub-vertical structural grain (Horstmann, 1981).\nIn the following, we assess the above hypothesis through the application of attribute and geostatistical analyses of the seismic images. The validity of these approaches, which, as of yet, have not been used in a related context, is tested on synthetic seismic reflection surveys for canonical models of crustal heterogeneity with a sub-vertical structural grain.\n\n3.1\nSynthetic seismic data\nTo explore the seismic expressions of a sub-vertical structural grain associated with local heterogeneities, we evaluate and analyse synthetic seismic data for canonical crustal models based on Holliger et al.'s (1993) geostatistical conceptualization of Ivrea-type lower crust (Fig. 8\n). We consider both a standard Gaussian-distributed stochastic model as well as a binarized version thereof, which allows us to explore the end-member-type seismic responses of smoothly varying and abruptly changing material properties along sub-vertical structures (Fig. 8). The density fluctuations in both models are characterized by a so-called von Karman autocovariance function (e.g., Tronicke and Holliger, 2005) with vertical and horizontal correlation lengths a\n\nz\n and a\n\nx\n of 800\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m, respectively, a Hurst number \u03bd of 0.3, and a constant mean density of 2800\u00a0kg\/m3. Both the P- and S-wave velocities are kept constant at 7000\u00a0m\/s and 4200\u00a0m\/s, respectively, to facilitate the subsequent imaging and to reduce associated biases. The Gaussian-distributed model is characterized by standard deviation of the density fluctuations of ~100\u00a0kg\/m3, while the density values in the binary-distributed model are either 2600\u00a0kg\/m3 or 2800\u00a0kg\/m3. As such, the average impedance contrasts in the binary-distributed model are significantly higher than those of its Gaussian-distributed counterpart. The considered autocovariance model as well as its correlation lengths and \u03bd-value are consistent with the results of Holliger et al. (1993) inferred from the combined stochastic analysis of geological maps and rock physical properties for some key locations in the IVZ. The binary-distributed model can be regarded as a first-order approximation of a complex interlayering of mafic and felsic rocks locally prevailing in the IVZ (Holliger et al., 1993), while the Gaussian-distributed model emulates compositionally less heterogeneous upper crustal granitic and gneissic rocks (e.g., Holliger, 1996, 1997) and, hence, can be expected to rather representative of the gneisses and mylonites prevailing in the Sesia Zone and the Insubric Line, respectively.\nFor these models, we then generated synthetic seismic reflection surveys using a staggered-grid finite-difference solution of the elastic wave equation, which is fourth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time (e.g., Levander, 1988). All key acquisition and processing parameters were chosen to emulate those of the field data. The source is a Ricker wavelet with a centre frequency of 80 Hz. Figs. 9 and 10\n\n show the resulting stacked and migrated synthetic seismic sections. The data for the binary-distributed model exemplarily illustrate the potential of the chosen acquisition and processing strategy for detecting and imaging seismic energy backscattered from local heterogeneities associated with larger-scale sub-vertical structures characterized by strong impedance contrasts. This backscattered energy is also present, albeit in a much less prominent manner, in the synthetic data for the Gaussian-distributed stochastic model. In this context, it is important to note that, in terms of the overall characteristics, both the stacked and migrated field data of L1 bear a conceptual similarity with their synthetic counterparts for the Gaussian-distributed model. This observation is consistent with the fact that L1 is primarily located in gneissic and mylonitic rocks, for which the fluctuations in the material properties are indeed expected to be continuous and quasi-Gaussian (e.g., Holliger, 1996, 1997).\n\n\n3.2\nAttribute analysis and geostatistical inversion\nTo enhance the seismic energy backscattered from heterogeneities associated with sub-vertical structures, we subjected the migrated versions of both synthetic and field data to energy-based attributed analysis (Fig. 11\n). This attribute is commonly used in sedimentary environments to assist the detection and characterization of lateral structural discontinuities associated with, for example, faults and chimneys (e.g., Avseth et al., 2010). Here, we explored the potential utility of this attribute in complex hardrock environments for revealing the coherence between individual \u201cbright lineaments\u201d associated with seismic energy backscattered seismic from local heterogeneities associated with the overall structure grain. The backscattered energy was calculated using a moving window with a length of 60\u00a0ms along each trace and defined as the sum of the squared sample values within the window normalized by the number of samples. Fig. 11 shows a comparison of the energy images of synthetic seismic data for Gaussian- and binary-distributed models with that for the field data recorded along L1, L2, and L3. This illustrates the consistency amongst the observed data as well as their similarity in character with the synthetic data in general and those for the Gaussian-distributed model in particular, which, in turn, qualitatively supports the hypothesis outlined above and, thus, the prevalence of the sub-vertical structures throughout the imaged part of the upper crust.\nTo further corroborate and quantify this interpretation, we proceeded to analyse the migrated synthetic and field data using the method of Irving et al. (2009), which relates the geostatistical properties of images of the backscattered wavefields to those of the scattering media. Specifically, this method allows to estimate the structural aspect ratio of the underlying heterogeneity and, to a lesser extent, also its complexity, which for the von Karman autocovariance model is quantified by the Hurst number \u03bd. While this technique has been applied successfully to heterogeneous sub-horizontally structured environments (e.g., Irving et al., 2009; Irving and Holliger, 2010; Scholer et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2020), its applicability in the presence of sub-vertical structures was as of yet unproven. In the following, we therefore first assess the viability of this approach for our synthetic data and subsequently apply it to the observed data.\n\nFig. 12\n shows the corresponding validation for the migrated synthetic seismic images for the Gaussian- and binary-distributed models as well as the results obtained for the field data recorded along L1, L2, and L3 based on a Monte-Carlo-type inversion approach (e.g., Xu et al., 2020). Please note that the first ~200\u00a0m of L3, which run sub-parallel to strike, have been excluded from this analysis. We see that the resulting statistics for the synthetic data (Fig. 12a and b) are largely consistent with the ratio of the vertical to horizontal correlation lengths a\n\nz\n\/a\n\nx\n of 4 for the underlying models. The results for the Hurst number \u03bd are, as expected from previous studies (e.g., Xu et al., 2020), less well constrained, but nevertheless in the correct range. These results thus seem to confirm the validity of the method of Irving et al. (2009) even in the presence sub-vertical structures. The corresponding analyses of the field data also point to a structural aspect ratio a\n\nz\n\/a\n\nx\n that is significantly larger than unity as well as to a rather small \u03bd-value. While the former agrees with the presumed dominance of sub-vertically aligned heterogeneities, the latter is consistent with the observation that the stochastic distribution of elastic properties in crystalline rocks seems to be universally characterized by low \u03bd-values (e.g., Holliger, 1996, 1997). An interesting observation is that the character of the histogram of the a\n\nz\n\/a\n\nx\n-values for L2 differs from that for the synthetic data as well as that for L1 and L3, which may be due to the fact the L2 runs oblique to strike and has a lower S\/N than the two other lines.\n\n\n3.3\nDip angle analysis\nThe above qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that the outcropping sub-vertical structures are likely to persist throughout the upper crustal section imaged by our seismic data. The question that still needs to be addressed concerns the average dip of the structural grain, which, provides information as to whether the dominant dips observed at the surface remain more or less constant or undergo significant changes at depth. We found that this problem can be approached by analysing the secondary lobes of the autocorrelations of the energy images (Fig. 11), which reveal the larger-scale alignment of the backscattered energy across the entire section. To assess and validate this novel approach, we again generated synthetic seismic reflection data for our stochastic models with the same structures as before (Fig. 8), but inclined by 10, 20, and 30 degrees with regard to the vertical. Figs. 13 and 14\n\n show the corresponding Gaussian- and binary-distributed seismic models together with the 2D autocorrelations of the corresponding energy images of the synthetic seismic data. While there is some interpretational leeway, the trend of secondary lobes of the autocorrelations is clearly indicative of the overall structural dip. Fig. 15\n shows the autocorrelation of the energy image of field data collected along L1, L2, and L3. Note that the first ~200\u00a0m of L3, which run sub-parallel to strike (Fig. 3), have again not been considered in this analysis. The autocorrelations of the energy images of L1 and L3 exhibit prominent side lobes whose trends point to steep dips of the order of 10 degrees in the east-west direction. This is consistent with the predominant dips prevailing at the surface (Horstmann, 1981) and seems to confirm that the outcropping structural grain seems to persist throughout the seismically imaged part of the upper crust. Conversely, the result for L2, which runs oblique to strike over its entire length and has a lower S\/N than L1 and L3, is more ambiguous due to the absence of well-defined side lobes.\nFinally, Fig. 16\n provides a synoptic consolidation of the results of this study in form of an overlay-type representation of the seismic depth images and the associated energy-based attributed of L1, L2, and L3, juxtaposed with the local surface geology mapped by Horstmann (1981) and Quick et al. (2003). Also shown are the dips of the predominant structures, namely the mylonitic border zone of Insubric Line crossed by L1 and the gabbro\/peridotite contact near Balmuccia crossed by L3. For both of these sub-vertical structures, there is a clear correlation with changes in seismic character whose vertically continuous and laterally discontinuous nature is highlighted by the energy-based attributes. This representation of the seismic data is consistent with our previous qualitative and quantitative analyses, which indicate that the sub-vertical structural grain prevailing at the surface is likely to continue at least throughout the first one to two kilometres of subsurface imaged in our survey.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion and conclusions\nWe have presented the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of a high-resolution seismic reflection survey crossing the Insubric Line from the Sesia Zone into the IVZ. The objective of this survey, which consists of three ~1-km-long lines of variable S\/N, was to characterize the first ~1\u00a0km of the subsurface in preparation for an ICDP drilling project aiming to explore lower continental crust exposed in the IVZ. Given that the structures exposed at the surface are sub-vertical, the key challenge for this project was to reliably assess whether the outcropping structural grain is continuous at depth or whether there are any indications for major flattening or shallow-angle cut-offs. Given this scenario, specular-type reflections were unlikely and the backscattered energy, which seemingly manifests itself as local bright lineaments in the seismic images, was tentatively interpreted as originating from small-scale heterogeneities associated with the sub-vertical large-scale structural grain.\nTo test this hypothesis and to corroborate the associated qualitative interpretation of the seismic images, we have generated synthetic seismic reflection surveys for sub-vertically structured canonical models of crustal heterogeneity. The acquisition and processing parameters of these synthetic seismic surveys emulate those of the field data. We consider both Gaussian- and binary-distributed heterogeneities for our models. While the stacked and imaged synthetic data for the Gaussian-distributed models bear a clear resemblance with the field data, the synthetic data for binary-distributed models exemplarily illustrate that the recorded backscattered energy originates from local heterogeneities associated with the overall sub-vertical large-scale structural grain. This interpretation was corroborated by performing energy-based attribute analysis as well as by a geostatistical inversion of the depth images of the observed and synthetic seismic data with regard to the structural aspect ratios of the backscattering structures. For the latter, we first needed to demonstrate the validity of the underlying method, which was originally conceived for sub-horizontal structured environments, in the presence of sub-vertical structures. Although, this geostatistical analysis is less sensitive to the complexity of the underlying medium than to its structural aspect ratio, the corresponding results are consistent with the ubiquitous and seemingly universal characteristics of crystalline rocks. Finally, we illustrate that the alignment of the side lobes of the 2D autocorrelation of the seismic energy images allows to assess the overall dip of the prevailing larger-scale structural grain, which for the observed data is consistent with the sub-vertical east-west dip of the predominant structures mapped at the surface.\nThe qualitative and quantitative analyses of our seismic reflection survey thus indicate that the sub-vertical structural grain exposed at the surface is likely to prevail throughout the imaged part of the upper crust. Beyond addressing this specific objective, the multi-faceted and unconventional approach pursued in this study provides interesting insights and potentially new perspectives with regard to the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of high-resolution seismic reflection data in crystalline terranes and their capacity for providing information on complex structures whose dips are too steep for deterministic imaging. Conversely, it is important to bear in mind that this seismic reflection survey violated the method's founding assumptions and, while the results of our unconventional interpretation approaches seem interesting and promising, we are unable to authoritatively validate and generalize them at this point. A critical question in this context, and indeed for most, if not all, 2D seismic reflection profiles, concerns the importance of 3D effects. This is particularly pertinent in our case, as, although the strike and dip of the larger-scale geological structures are quite stable along the survey, this quasi-2D assumption cannot be extended to the smaller-scale heterogeneities, which are superimposed on these larger structures, and which represent the very target of our interpretation efforts. Rigorously addressing the associated question regarding the importance of 3D scattering effects on our results would require extensive 3D finite-difference-type elastic modelling for a wide range of scenarios. While this is clearly beyond the scope of the current work, it represents an interesting and pertinent research problem in its own right, which ultimately will need to be addressed in order to assess the reliability and robustness of the proposed interpretation approaches. At present, our admittedly quite speculative hypothesis in this regard is that, due to their inherent 3D nature, out-of-plane scattering effects would have a tendency of reducing, rather than enhancing, the sub-vertical alignment of backscattered seismic events with regard to the considered 2D reference case. This, in turn, would imply that we tend to underestimate, rather than overestimate, the ratio of the vertical to horizontal correlation lengths a\n\nz\n\/a\n\nx.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nY.L. responsible for: Conceptualization; Methodology; Validation; Visualization; Writing - original draft.\nA.G responsible for: Data curation; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Supervision; Writing - original draft; Writing - review & editing.\nL.B. responsible for: Data curation; Formal analysis; Investigation; Resources.\nG.H. responsible for: Conceptualization; Data curation; Funding acquisition; Project administration; Resources; Writing - review & editing.\nK.H. responsible for: Conceptualization; Investigation; Methodology; Supervision; Validation; Writing \u2013 original draft; Writing \u2013 review & editing.\n\n","176":"","177":"","178":"","179":"","180":"","181":"","182":"","183":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nEvaluation and characterization of CO2 storage sites and exploration prospects require an understanding of faults that are critical to site integrity. Many techniques exist for risking faults related to prospects\/traps, most relying on a 3D fault model derived from seismic interpretation. This fault model is rarely challenged regarding seismic interpretation uncertainty. Seismic data comes with limitations and interpretation pitfalls - both objective uncertainties related to the dataset itself and subjective uncertainties related to human bias when conducting seismic interpretation. This study explores the challenges and pitfalls related to interpreting normal faults by comparing objective and subjective uncertainties, and addresses how these can be identified, resolved and minimized.\nFaults are usually picked as two-dimensional lines (fault sticks; main bold lines in Fig. 1\n) or simple, discrete planes in 3D data compared to complex zones observed in outcrop geology (Fig. 1). Detailed fault architectural elements including segments, splays and lenses, and the damage zones are commonly below seismic detection-levels. In seismic models, fault surfaces are created by linked two-dimensional fault sticks, which represent a single surface that is inconsistent with the characteristics of faults in outcrop (Fig. 1; e.g., Wibberley et al., 2008; Childs et al., 2009; Braathen et al., 2009). Further, the depth interval where faults are picked in seismic data dictates the resolution of the geological model and thereby the extracted details. Fault illumination and imaging are associated with significant constraints; larger faults are easier to identify than smaller ones due to larger throws and thereby larger offsets of seismic horizons (Misra and Mukherjee, 2018), whereas fault dip impacts as to what extent the fault plane can be imaged at all. There may however be additional information available in 3D seismic data, e.g. attributes such as variance and dip, which in cases can allow detection of faults and imaging of deformed rock volumes (Alaei and Torabi, 2017; Cunningham et al., 2019).\nUncertainty associated with seismic interpretation falls into two different categories, objective and subjective (Tannert et al., 2007). All interpretations host elements of both (Bond et al., 2007; Schaaf and Bond, 2019). Objective uncertainties relate to limitations of seismic data in terms of resolution and quality, imaging issues of complex subsurface geometries, as well as uncertainties in seismic velocities used for depth conversion (Bond, 2015; Schaaf and Bond, 2019). Even though seismic data have improved over the last 40\u00a0years (Fig. 2\n), there are still significant limitations in resolution that impact fault interpretation. On the other hand, subjective uncertainties or human bias hang on interpreter's fault-picks that will vary based on their experience and background as well as time invested into the task (Bond et al., 2007; Bond, 2015; Schaaf and Bond, 2019; Michie et al., 2021). Several studies have worked with geological uncertainties, interpretation and reasoning skills related to structural geology in 2D (e.g., Bond et al., 2007, 2011, 2012, 2015; Freeman et al., 2010; Bond, 2015; Alcalde et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c) and 3D seismic data (Schaaf and Bond, 2019).\nIn this study, we explore how to identify, resolve and address uncertainties and pitfalls associated with fault interpretation. Objective uncertainties are investigated by utilising two seismic datasets, conventional and high-resolution P-Cable seismic data, with differing resolutions from the Hoop area, SW Barents Sea (Fig. 3\n). We also address subjective uncertainties associated with interpretation of two key seismic profiles from the 3D seismic data by comparing the fault interpretations from a test-panel consisting of 20 geoscientists with different geological and geophysical background. Notably, this is not a case study of the geological evolution of the Hoop area. There is a generic focus on imaging and detection of faults in seismic datasets having different resolution (both vertical and horizontal). The Hoop area is selected because of the unique seismic datasets and the existence of interesting structural and depositional features (faults and clinoforms) in the shallow subsurface where the high-resolution seismic data demonstrate their strength.\nThe comparison of fault-picks is complemented by 2(3)D point-spread function (PSF)-based convolution seismic modelling (Lecomte et al., 2015). The same type of seismic modelling has been previously explored based on outcrop-studies (e.g. Anell et al., 2016; Botter et al., 2017; Rabbel et al., 2018; Eide et al., 2018; Lubrano-Lavadera et al., 2018; Wrona et al., 2020), analogue models (Kjoberg et al., 2017) and numerical discrete element models (DEM; Botter et al., 2014, 2016). Such studies contribute to (1) increase confidence in seismic interpretation, (2) investigate the gap in scale between outcrop and seismic data, and (3) determine the importance of seismic imaging issues (e.g., seismic resolution and detectability, interference of reflections from closely spaced interfaces) for the outcome of subsurface geological interpretations. With seismic modelling, we explore a statistical mean fault model and several models reflecting variability of different fault scenarios based on the interpretations from the test-panel. By means of this, we address (1) how resolution and illumination influence mapping of seismic faults, and (2) how high-resolution seismic data combined with seismic modelling can advise the interpretation of conventional seismic data.\n\n\n2\nBackground\nThe dataset used in this study is centred on the NE-SW trending Hoop Fault Complex (HFC; Gabrielsen et al., 1990) in the SW Barents Sea (Fig. 3a,b). HFC is located in the transition between the Bjarmeland Platform to the east and deeper basins to the west (Fingerdjupet Subbasin) and southwest (Maud Basin). The Hoop area is characterized by NNE-SSW and WNW-ESE fault sets (Collanega et al., 2017), of which two faults of the dominant NNE-SSW system are the focus of this study (faults F1 and F2; Fig. 3). The Hoop area has experienced several pulses of faulting. Three of these are of relevance to the stratigraphic interval studied here: (1) Middle Triassic, (2) Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and (3) Early Cretaceous (Gabrielsen et al., 1990; Fitriyanto, 2011; Collanega et al., 2017; Serck et al., 2017; Faleide et al., 2019).\n\n2.1\nDatabase\nThis study utilises the CFI_HFC 3D (2\u00a0ms HiRes) conventional seismic data and the overlapping HR14_3D_HFCE1 high-resolution P-Cable seismic volume, which both cover the area known as Gemini North (Fig. 3). The conventional 3D survey was acquired in 2012 by TGS and has a bin size of 12.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a018.75\u00a0m. We apply a reprocessed version of the 3D cube with 2\u00a0ms sampling resulting in improved resolution due to a broader frequency band compared to the 4\u00a0ms sampled data utilised in Faleide et al. (2019). The cube is cut at 2000\u00a0ms TWT for this study. The high-resolution (P-Cable) 3D survey was acquired in 2014 by TGS, WGP and VBPR, has a bin size of 4.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.25\u00a0m and extends down to 1150\u00a0ms TWT. Both conventional and high-resolution P-Cable seismic offer zero-phase polarity, and peaks corresponding to an increase in acoustic impedance are represented as red.\nWe utilize five exploration wells (Fig. 3), 7325\/4\u20131 (Gemini North), 7324\/6\u20131 (Sputnik), 7324\/2\u20131 (Apollo), 7325\/1\u20131 (Atlantis) and 7324\/3\u20131 (Intrepid Eagle), to obtain information on lithologies and physical properties based on geophysical logs, in addition to age and boundaries between the main formations\/seismic sequences. The Gemini North well is the most important for this study since it is located inside the focus study area of overlapping conventional and P-Cable seismic volumes, and provides elastic parameters for the seismic modelling. We utilize the gamma ray log for lithology prediction, the sonic and density logs for 1D synthetic seismic traces, and time\/depth relation of the well for seismic velocity estimations and depth conversion.\n\n\n2.2\nSeismic imaging and resolution\nSince most normal faults at intermediate and shallow depths in sedimentary basins are rather steep, the fault itself is rarely imaged by seismic data. Instead, imaging is reliant on identification of reflection terminations and offsets, which in turn are dependent on seismic resolution. Seismic resolution is determined by the relationship between the interval velocity and the dominant frequency. Migration techniques applied also influence the final seismic resolution (Cartwright and Huuse, 2005). Velocity generally increases with burial depth due to mechanical and chemical compaction (Bj\u00f8rlykke, 2015), whereas the frequency tends to decrease with depth as higher frequencies are more attenuated than lower ones (Brown, 2011). The combined effect is a decrease in resolution with depth.\nThe vertical resolution (limit of separability) for seismic data is a quarter of a wavelength (\u03bb\/4; Brown, 2011). The limit of visibility (Brown, 2011), or detectability, can vary depending on the seismic data quality. For data with a high signal-to-noise ratio, the limit of visibility can be as small as \u03bb\/30 (Brown, 2011). The horizontal resolution for good 3D migrated seismic data is about \u03bb\/2 (Herron, 2011). Bin size and trace spacing are of equal importance with respect to horizontal resolution, in addition to the survey aperture (Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018). The horizontal resolution for (migrated) seismic data is therefore both frequency dependent (\u03bb\/2) and survey geometry dependent (Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018).\nP-Cable data typically have a vertical resolution of 3\u20137\u00a0m in the shallow subsurface (the upper about 500\u00a0m below the seabed), compared to 15\u201325\u00a0m in the conventional seismic data (Faleide et al., 2019). This is confirmed by studying the seismic data and the synthetic traces at the Gemini North well (Fig. 4\n). We use the average velocity in the target depth interval from wells, and frequency from the power spectrum extracted from the seismic volume (Fig. S1.1 in supplementary material 1) to calculate the wavelength (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0v\/f; Herron, 2011).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods and workflows\nThe approach of this study is designed to meet the main aims; how to identify, resolve and address uncertainties and pitfalls associated with fault interpretation. Different methodologies are combined, and the main steps of the overall workflow are summarized in Fig. 5\n.\n\n3.1\nSeismic interpretation\nThe seismic interpretation part of the study includes three components: (1) One interpreter (the first author) performing a detailed 3D seismic interpretation, in a focus area around the Gemini North well (Figs. 3 and 5a); (2) 20 geoscientists interpreting the same two seismic lines from each of the two seismic volumes manually on paper (Fig. 5b); and (3) automatic seismic interpretation on a limited area in the same two seismic data volumes (Fig. 5h). The combined results identify uncertainties, especially when considering individual interpreters.\nA seismic-stratigraphic tie from the Gemini North well to the 3D seismic volumes is established utilising sonic and density logs (Fig. 4). The corresponding (1D) synthetic traces and their matching reflections for the Lower Cretaceous in the seismic data are correlated to the seismic stratigraphic framework in Faleide et al. (2019), which was mainly calibrated to the Apollo well (Fig. 3). The Jurassic and Triassic horizons are tied to formation tops in the Gemini North well (Norwegian Petroleum Directorate FactPages, 2021). The Lower Cretaceous Unconformity (LCU; Midtkandal et al., 2019) is mapped in both the conventional CFI_HFC 3D (2\u00a0ms HiRes) and high-resolution HR14_3D_HFCE1 seismic volumes and it highlights the structural elements in the Hoop area (Fig. 3b). We also perform a detailed fault and horizon mapping in a smaller area east of the Hoop graben (red box in Fig. 3a,b) in the high-resolution 3D data covering the Gemini North well and the location of the seismic lines used for the seismic modelling. Inlines and crosslines in the 3D cube are interpreted with varying increment (1, 5, 10 or 25) depending on continuity, strength, and structural complexity of the reflections.\nTwo main NNE-SSW trending faults, F1 and F2, are interpreted on each inline within the focus area (red box in Fig. 3). The faults are chosen since they bound the fault block hosting the Gemini North well, which provides the elastic parameters used in the seismic modelling. The seismic variance attribute, based on isolating edges and discontinuities from the input data set, as well as time-structure maps produced from seismic horizons are used to highlight the faults. These are used for selection of the WNW-ESE oriented key profile (Fig. 3e,f), to be interpreted by the test-panel, based on the following criteria: (1) Crossing orthogonally both NNE-SSW faults, F1 and F2; (2) Parallel to and staying away from the minor WNW-ESE faults (Fig. 3c,d); (3) F1 and F2 should have different seismic expressions to challenge the test-panel.\nTo test subjective uncertainties related to seismic interpretation of faults the panel of 20 geoscientists manually interpreted the same 2D seismic time-section (vertical exaggeration x 5) selected from both the conventional and high-resolution 3D volumes (Figs. 3e,f and 5b). The test-panel members have different background (structural geologists, sedimentologists and geophysicists) and level of experience\/expertise (PhD, post doc., professors and industry professionals). They traced the faults over a period of 20\u00a0min for each seismic section. This task was first conducted using the conventional seismic section and then repeated for the high-resolution seismic section. The interpreters could not refer to the first section when interpreting the second, in order to limit the bias by comparing datasets. The task was to focus on structural interpretation (faults), while the horizons were interpreted later by the first author adjusting the interpretation to the fault picks from the test-panel.\nOne way to minimize the subjective uncertainty in fault interpretation is to apply fully data-driven fault identification. A variety of data-driven or data-assisted fault interpretation methods exists (e.g. Bahorich and Farmer, 1995; Hale, 2013), and recently, machine learning has proven to be a popular choice for automatic fault identification (Huang et al., 2017; Zhao and Mukhopadhyay, 2018; Wu et al., 2019). Here, we include a synthetical pre-trained machine learning model as interpreter #21 (Fig. 5h). This fault pick (#21) is compared to the manual picks of interpreters #1\u201320. The machine learning model was trained on a few hundred synthetic volumes, with both planar and listric fault examples, where each training cube of 128x128x128 pixels included 2\u20136 faults, and the model was trained with a U-Net-shaped 3D fully convolutional neural network (Ronneberger et al., 2015). This approach, using a synthetically trained neural network for automatic fault identification was first proposed by Wu et al. (2019). Because of the variability in the synthetic data used to train the model, the model is generic and not fine-tuned to one specific dataset or case study. Hence, the same trained model is applied to both the conventional and the high-resolution datasets described in this paper.\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic modelling\nSeismic modelling is a valuable tool linking geological models and seismic images, hence relationships between geology and seismic response. Modelling results may guide seismic interpretation helping the interpreter to separate real structures from seismic artefacts (e.g., Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016; Anell et al., 2016).\nSeismic modelling can be carried out in different ways. The simplest method of making synthetic seismic is by 1D convolution, which is a standard technique used for well-to-seismic tie in interpretation tools (Mondol, 2015; Lecomte et al., 2016). 1D synthetic seismograms have large uncertainties and limitations in geologically complex areas since the 1D approach does not take lateral velocity variations into account (Botter et al., 2014; Lecomte et al., 2016). A more ideal and valid approach with the potential of resolving geological details is to perform full-wavefield modelling, in which complete synthetic seismograms are generated based on solutions of the differential wave equation by a finite difference approach (Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016). However, this advanced technique is time-consuming and cannot be carried out on a routine base.\n2(3)D PSF-based convolution modelling, a prestack depth migration (PSDM) simulator, offers an efficient and flexible intermediate option and can be performed both ray-based (e.g., Botter et al., 2014) and by a simple version using a generic filter, based on a few key parameters, to obtain the PSF (Botter et al., 2014; Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016). The 2(3)D PSF-based seismic modelling still uses the convolution principle but goes beyond a 1D approach, for which the wavelet is the sole element of the convolution operator, by using instead a 2(3)D convolution operator, i.e., the PSF (Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016). This is more realistic than 1D convolution as it considers model and survey dependent 2(3)D resolution and illumination effects, including diffraction energy. The method results in a better modelling of complex structures, especially when full-wavefield modelling is not affordable. PSF-based convolution modelling allows geologists to better understand seismic images in relation to the input geomodels, analyse them and possibly improve their interpretation, thus being more critical in their conclusions (Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Lecomte et al., 2015; Anell et al., 2016). This modelling approach has recently been applied to fault models with promising results (Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Lecomte et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015; Mascolo and Lecomte, 2020).\n\n3.2.1\nModel building\nAn important and time-consuming step of the seismic modelling workflow is to build the 2D geological models (Fig. 5e). All interpretations are scanned and imported as images into the interpretation software (e.g., MOVE; Fig. 5c,d), in addition to SEG-Y files for the two overlapping seismic lines. The original seismic lines are geo-referenced in this software \u2013 this allows transfer of the fault and horizon interpretation back to a seismic interpretation software (e.g., Petrel). Each interpretation is scaled correct to the seismic lines, and the fault interpretations are traced over and defined as individual fault set (one set for each interpreter) by the first author. The fault sets are connected to the original seismic lines (imported SEG-Y), for both the conventional and high-resolution seismic and their interpretations. The scanned images are hidden and only the fault sets (digital version of the fault interpretation by each interpreter), which now have the correct coordinates, remain and they can be ticked off and on to the seismic profiles when performing the analysis.\nA simple density statistical study is utilised on both key profiles with all 20 interpretations, counting how many single fault interpretations (\u00a82D fault sticks\u00a8) that goes through or terminate inside each 3*3\u00a0mm squares in a grid covering the complete seismic line (Fig. 6c,d). The number of fault picks are divided into colour intervals (Fig. 6e,f). A statistical mean fault model is constructed based on the colour-coded statistics for the interpretations of the high-resolution seismic data (Fig. 6f).\nIn areas 1 and 2 (Fig. 6b), all interpretations of the high-resolution seismic data are sorted into different variability scenarios based on fault interpretation similarities (Fig. 7\n; Figs. S2.1-S2.3 in supplementary material 2). For each scenario, a hybrid fault interpretation is made based on all interpretations grouped into this (Fig. S2.3 in supplementary material 2). Finally, the horizons are traced by the first author and adjusted to the faults (Figs. 5d and 7). The horizon tracing varies a bit from each scenario since it is constrained by the fault interpretation. The mapped horizons and faults are depth-converted according to the two-way-travel time (TWT) and average velocity information from the Gemini North well (Fig. 5d). The depth-converted horizons and faults are exported as an image and imported to a graphics program (in an artboard with a reasonable pixel size relative to the size of the model; preferable 1 px\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0m, corresponding to 1\u00a0m sampling) where they are converted to editable traces. Each layer is assigned a colour indicative of geological age. Since faults are often represented in seismic data by displacement of layers\/reflections, and not the fault plane itself, fault picks are removed. The resultant model is exported as a PNG file, ready for input to the seismic modelling software (Figs. 5f and 7).\n\n\n3.2.2\nPSF-based convolution modelling\nThe main steps of the workflow for the PSF-based convolution seismic modelling are presented in Fig. 8\n. A 2D geological model is created from depth-converted horizon and fault interpretations. This model is exported as a PNG image, assigned constant elastic parameters (Vp, Vs, density) for each layer and converted to SEG-Y file format. The SEG-Y files are imported into the seismic modelling software. A reflectivity model (Fig. 8d) is first generated from the geological model and elastic parameters using the Zoeppritz equations (Shuey, 1985). We use a simplified version of the PSF-based convolution modelling by designing PSFs from a few key parameters (Lecomte et al., 2016). An equivalent PSDM filter is generated based on a generic illumination pattern defined by a regular illumination of all reflector dips until a selected maximum (e.g., 0\u00b0-45\u00b0 dip range), an average velocity calculated from the well data, incident angle based on survey geometry (typical offsets), and wavelets extracted from the seismic data. The PSF is obtained from a Fourier Transform (FT) of the PSDM filter (Fig. 8e) and convolved with the reflectivity model to obtain a synthetic (PSDM-like) seismic image (Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016). The synthetic seismic image (Fig. 8f) of the input geological model can be analysed as function of various wavelets, and the different parameters mentioned earlier.\nGeophysical parameters such as illumination angles, incident angle, wavelets, and elastic parameters affect the outcome of the modelling, i.e. the synthetic seismic data. Variations in geophysical parameters are tested by different wavelets and incident angles representative of both the conventional and high-resolution seismic volumes. By varying the wavelets, hence the dominant frequency and bandwidth, for the same geological model, different resolutions of the synthetic seismic data become available. Wavelets are extracted from both seismic datasets with different time-windows: interval 700\u2013900\u00a0ms TWT, complete vertical window (600\u20131150 TWT), and each 100 TWT interval (650\u2013750, 750\u2013850, etc.). The representative dominant frequencies in the study area for conventional and high-resolution seismic data are 40\u00a0Hz and 150\u00a0Hz, respectively (Fig. S1.1 in supplementary material 1). For the target areas around F1 and F2, the dominant frequencies are 40\u201345\u00a0Hz and 90\u00a0Hz, respectively (750\u2013850 TWT interval; Fig. S1.1 in supplementary material 1). A 45\u00b0 illumination angle is used, meaning that reflectors having dips between 0 and 45\u00b0 are illuminated. The incident angle for the long-offset conventional seismic data is set to 20\u00b0, while 0\u00b0 is used for the short-offset high-resolution seismic data (Fig. S1.1 in supplementary material 1). The elastic parameters, Vp, Vs and density, for the geological models are summarized in Table S3.1 in supplementary material 3.\nThe synthetic seismic sections become more realistic by adding some noise. A coloured-noise model is here generated by convolution of a random white reflectivity model with the same PSF used for the synthetic seismic described earlier, thus reproducing the same (PSDM-like) filtering effect that the geological models have in the seismic modelling. The noise model reflectivity range is scaled according to the reflectivity range of the input geological model in order to examine a spectrum of signal-to-noise ratios. All synthetic seismic sections, included the noise components, are also amplitude-calibrated so that an isolated peak of strength +1 in reflectivity will correspond to a peak of amplitude +1 in the calibrated seismic. Difference plots are a powerful tool for comparison and detection of differences in synthetic seismic sections. They can detect the differences between the fault scenarios, and how the fault and horizon interpretation affect the seismic imaging.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSeismic interpretations\nFaults in the study area are visible in the time-structure map of the Lower Cretaceous Unconformity (LCU) derived from conventional seismic data (Fig. 3b). The variance cube highlights the faults in the area at 800\u00a0ms (Fig. 3a,c-d). A broader regional extent of faults can be observed in the conventional 3D that covers a larger area, where the major Hoop graben changes from a N-S orientation in the north of the area to a NE-SW orientation farther south (Fig. 3b). Faults sets showing N-S, NE-SW, NNE-SSW and WNW-ESE trends are imaged, including the Hoop graben and its bounding faults. The selected WNW-ESE seismic sections, orthogonal to faults F1 and F2, are located c. 1.7\u00a0km from the Gemini North well (Fig. 3c-f). The fault throw is largest at the level of the Triassic units and decreases up-section (Fig. 6). F1 has average throws of 55\u00a0m within the Triassic, 41\u00a0m in the Jurassic and 21\u00a0m in the Lower Cretaceous units. Corresponding values for F2 are 50\u00a0m, 35\u00a0m and 17\u00a0m, respectively.\nThe fault picks of all 20 interpreters identify the main faults F1 and F2 (Fig. 6). The conventional 3D data generally show more interpretation uniformity. Both F1 and F2 are segmented, and minor individual faults (e.g., z interval 800\u2013850\u00a0ms) are traced in the high-resolution data (Fig. 6b). In deeper parts of the sections (z\u00a0=\u00a0850\u20131000\u00a0ms), the interpretations of F1 and F2 are more consistent within each dataset compared to in the upper part (z\u00a0=\u00a0675\u2013850\u00a0ms). The latter relates to up-section splays that offer more options in picking for shallow parts of F1 and F2, which is highlighted in the scenario models presented in Chapter 4.2.2. Picking of minor faults varies in the two seismic data types, and the dip direction of the picked faults are less consistent in the high-resolution than in the conventional seismic. For the conventional data, antithetic faults were picked in the hanging wall of F2, while fault segments in the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous in between F1 and F2 are only suggested for the high-resolution data (Fig. 6e,f).\nThe automatic interpretation results from the pre-trained machine-learning model (Fig. 5h) show that most key elements of fault segments are identified in the high-resolution seismic data (Fig. 9e,f). Segments F1a and F1b are clearly detected and traced (Fig. 9f), rather similar to the mean interpretation (Fig. 9d). However, there are also some striking deviations between the manual (interpreters #1\u201320; Fig. 9a-b,i-j) and the automatic (#21; Fig. 9e-h) fault interpretations. The segments merge at a slightly shallower level than in the mean interpretation of the test-panel. F1a cuts H4 and terminates just above this horizon. Above F1b, a fault segment has been traced that merges with the monocline at H4 level. It cuts across H4 in the lower part of the monocline and continues downwards without a clear link to F1b. The deeper part of F1 appears even steeper than in the mean interpretation by the test-panel. The automatic interpretation of F2 in the high-resolution seismic is more segmented vertically (Fig. 9e). Fault segments F2a and F2b do not link. F2b is traced up-section well above H4, clearly offsetting this horizon. Further, the F2a segment is not traced as far up as in the mean interpretation of the test-panel, but cuts H4.\nThe automatic interpretation of the conventional seismic data (Fig. 9g,h) is unable to catch the same level of detail as described for the high-resolution seismic data. For F1 (Fig. 9h), the shallow fault segment above H4 is identified in a rather similar fashion. It appears that the conventional data lack the horizontal resolution needed to resolve the relationships between segments F1a and F1b. The automatic interpretation tries to delimit the fault block between F1a and F1b but with limited success. For F2 (Fig. 9g), the interpreted fault segment above H4 makes a strange bend before it interferes with the monocline at H4 level. There is no linkage with deeper segments of F2, and segment F2a is not identified. Compared to the automatic picks mentioned above, there are however large variations in the interpretations of the conventional data by the test-panel (Fig. 9i,j).\n\n\n4.2\nGeological models and synthetic seismic\nSeveral queries around validity of fault picks are explored by the synthetic seismic testing of scenario-based models. Three different test populations are included: (i) one statistical mean fault model covering the whole seismic section; (ii) four scenarios based on variability in a limited area of F1; and (iii) five scenarios based on variability targeting parts of F2 (Fig. 6b). The 2D geological models are based on the high-resolution seismic data since this dataset provides better imaging, hence details, of the actual geology.\n\n4.2.1\nStatistical mean fault model\nThe statistical mean model (Fig. 10b), 7\u00a0km wide and 450\u00a0m high (with 0\u2013450\u00a0m as the depth range of the model), consists of 34 layers with individual elastic parameters (Table S3.1 in supplementary material 3) and includes sedimentary strata from the Middle Triassic to Quaternary. The mean fault model of F1 and F2 suggests they split into two segments below c. 175\u00a0m, where they display a hard-linked antithetic fault in the footwall of the main segment (Fig. 10a,b). The interpreted antithetic fault is likely an artefact caused by poor imaging in a shadow zone in the footwalls of F1 and F2. This interpretation pitfall will be discussed later in the context of both objective and subjective uncertainties. Interpretations shallower than c. 175\u00a0m suggest that two fault segments occur between 100 and 175\u00a0m in F1 (F1a,b) and 50\u2013175\u00a0m in F2 (F2a,b). Minor synthetic and antithetic faults occur in between the two main faults. Segments F1a and F1b terminate below horizon H4, whereas two minor isolated fault segments occur in the H4-URU interval. For F2a and F2b minor offsets of H4 and the horizons above are apparent. Both segments terminate below URU.\nThe synthetic seismic sections emphasize the importance of resolution in the two seismic datasets (Fig. 10c,d). In the conventional synthetic section (Fig. 10c), reflections from closely spaced interfaces interfere, making it impossible to resolve individual thin layers with typical thickness of 5\u201310\u00a0m, for instance at label 1. In the high-resolution synthetic section (Fig. 10d), individual layers are better resolved and more interfaces can be identified. F1a can be traced farther up-section, perhaps all the way up to the two minor isolated fault segments in the H4-URU interval (label 2; Fig. 10c). There, due to the lower dominant frequency, the conventional synthetic seismic section masks some of the layers\/interfaces. For the high-resolution synthetic section, F1 clearly terminates below H3 (label 2; Fig. 10d), consistent with the statistical mean fault model (Fig. 10b). In deeper parts of F1 and F2, the fault plane itself is imaged in both the conventional and high-resolution synthetic sections (label 3; Fig. 10c,d). The down-faulted block in F1, between F1a and F1b, is visible in both synthetic sections but appears more distinctly layered in the high-resolution synthetic seismic (label 4; Fig. 10c,d). Similarly, the fault block between F2a and F2b (label 5; Fig. 10c,d) is more layered and isolated in the high-resolution synthetic seismic section. The minor antithetic and synthetic faults (at depth interval 125\u2013155\u00a0m) in between F1 and F2 are only imaged in the high-resolution synthetic seismic section, as these are largely below the seismic resolution of the conventional seismic data (label 6; Fig. 10c,d).\n\n\n4.2.2\nScenario models for F1 and F2\nUncertainty in picking of the two faults, F1 and F2, can be further explored in scenarios sorted based on varying fault geometries interpreted by the test-panel (Figs. 11 and 12\n\n; Fig. S2.3 in supplementary material 2). In areas with the largest variation in fault interpretations, hence largest subjective uncertainties (area 1 and area 2; Fig. 6b), scenarios were established based on variability and sorting into groups of similar fault geometries. Area 1, covering F1, is divided into four scenarios (Fig. 11) and area 2, covering F2 is divided into five scenarios (Fig. 12). Common to all scenarios is that they have significant geometric overlaps but offer slight variations in fault picks, for instance open or broken relay zones. Horizon picks vary inside complex fault geometries, where fault interpretations dictate how the horizons are traced. The scenario models for F1 and F2 are 950\u00a0m wide and 160\u00a0m high, and consist of 21\u201322 layers (Table S3.1 in supplementary material 3) covering sedimentary strata from Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous age. The Upper Triassic strata are only seen in the footwall of F1 and F2. Each scenario was investigated following the workflow in Figs. 7 and 8.\n\n4.2.2.1\nF1 scenarios\nScenario 1.1 (Fig. 11a) presents F1 as segments F1a and F1b that are disconnected by an open, vertical relay zone. Both segments offset LCU and terminate below H3. The horizon below the lower fault tip of F1b is traced to fit the fault geometry. A greater degree of interference is observed in the conventional compared to the high-resolution synthetic seismic section (label 1; Fig. 11a), with 11 reflections in the conventional synthetic seismic corresponding to 20 reflections in the high-resolution synthetic seismic. In both synthetic sections the deeper horizon is offset near the fault tip (label 2; Fig. 11a). This is better expressed in the high-resolution section, where the faults appear to branch even though the geological model shows F1a and F1b as disconnected. The horizons below the F1b fault tip flex towards F1a. For this apparent drag-fold, the conventional synthetic seismic appear with very small throw and a central horizon nearly connects with wall-rock layers (labels 2 and 3; Fig. 11). On the contrary, there are different layers juxtaposed across the fault in the high-resolution synthetic seismic. In this case, there is a distinct fault block bounded by F1a and F1b.\nA continuation of scenario 1.1 is a simple imbricated fan (scenario 1.2; Fig. 11b), which matches 12 of the 20 interpretations from the test-panel (Fig. S2.3 in supplementary material 2). In this scenario, the open, vertical relay is now breached by fault F1a curving and connecting with F1b at depth. Further, F1a and F1b terminate slightly shallower compared to scenario 1.1, but this is indiscernible in the synthetic seismic data. There is a slight difference in the deep part of the two scenarios but branching of the segments remains questionable in both (between labels 2 and 3 in Scenario 1.1 and between labels 3 and 4\/5 in Scenario 1.2; Fig. 11a,b). The conventional synthetic seismic is unable to resolve the lower part of the fault block bounded by F1a and F1b. At label 4 in the conventional synthetic seismic section, F1 is represented by a continuous reflection that appears to bend, linking the hanging wall and footwall. Notably, in the conventional synthetic seismic the flexing and apparent continuous reflection could easily be considered a fault tip monocline with intact layers in an open relay between deep and shallow fault tips. This contrasts the isolated layers in the fault block between F1a and F1b as depicted by the high-resolution data for both scenarios 1.1 and 1.2 (Fig. 11a,b).\nFor scenario 1.3 (Fig. 11c), the imbricated fan has been expanded to shallower levels. Near the upper tip, fault segments F1a and F1b breach the H3 and H4 horizons before terminating in the shallow subsurface at the top of the model. F1b is further segmented into three; the main fault segment F1b connected to two synthetic splays (F1c and F1d). Further, throws for F1c and F1d as well as F1a and F1b are minimal. The H3 and H4 horizons appear intact but flexed in both synthetic seismic sections (label 6; Fig. 11c), without offset as implemented in the geological model. However, reflections in the overlying H4-URU, for instance at label 7, are disturbed and may allow recognition of small throws for the high-resolution synthetic. On a different note, the apparent fault tip monocline discussed in scenario 1.2 (label 4; also better expressed in scenario 1.4, see below), is less prominent and more similar to scenario 1.1. A reason for this may be that the connection of F1a and F1b is deeper (c. 143\u00a0m) in the geological model compared to scenarios 1.2 and 1.4 (c. 135\u00a0m). Furthermore, the deeper part of the fault block is slightly wider for scenario 1.3. The small difference in offset and thickness can decrease the interference of the reflections and give a better separability of the layers.\nScenario 1.4 (Fig. 11d) explores a combined synthetic (F1a and F1b) fan with an antithetic splay (F1e) and a shallow isolated fault (F1f). This is a combination of scenarios 1.2 and 1.3, with F1a and F1b identical to scenario 1.2. The synthetic seismic sections reveal that F1e is indiscernible in any of them as the small throw is below seismic resolution. In the conventional synthetic seismic section, F1a appears to offset H3-H4 (label 8) while the high-resolution synthetic section shows continuous reflection associated with H3-H4.\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nF2 scenarios\nStructural expressions of F2 scenarios as outlined in Fig. 12 show similarities to the F1 scenarios (Fig. 11), but the fault segments vary in length and geometry. In these scenarios, H3 and H4 lack the high-amplitude in the hanging wall as seen in the actual seismic data, but can be used as key horizons to guide different scenarios in the synthetic seismic.\nScenario 2.1 displays the deeper F2a and a shallower F2b that are disconnected by a vertical open relay (Fig. 12a). Both fault tips curve towards each other in the relay. In the conventional synthetic seismic section there is significant interference where two reflections can be identified compared to five reflections in the high-resolution synthetic seismic section (label 1; Fig. 12a). The gentle disturbance labelled 2 in the conventional synthetic seismic section may look like a fault in the high-resolution synthetic seismic section. In contrast, the geological model does not include a fault in this position. In the relay zone at c. 112\u00a0m an apparent continuous curved reflection in the conventional synthetic seismic section (label 3; Fig. 12a) can be interpreted as a fault-tip monocline. This contradicts the high-resolution synthetic seismic section, where several reflections in the hanging wall flex and terminate at F2a (label 4; Fig. 12a). A monocline geometry is expressed in the conventional synthetic sections for all five scenarios and represents the most likely interpretation pitfall associated with F2. F2b offsets the shallowest reflections with a small (2\u20135\u00a0m) throw. Shallower parts of this fault may be picked in high-resolution synthetic section but only shows up as distortions of horizons in the conventional synthetic section (label 5).\nScenario 2.2 (Fig. 12b) tests an imbricated fan in which F2b bifurcates from F2a at depth (c. 125\u00a0m), which is similar to scenario 1.2. Fault F2a terminates below H3 while F2b offsets H4. This imbricated fan is clear in the high-resolution synthetic seismic section (between label 6 and 7; Fig. 12b). F2a and F2b are locally detected in the conventional synthetic seismic section (for all F2 scenarios) but it is not possible to outline the deeper part of the fault block bounded by the two fault segments.\nIn scenario 2.3, described as a more complex imbricated fan, F1 splays into three fault segments (F2a, F2b and F2c) that cut up-section, nearly to URU (Fig. 12c). Noticeably, both synthetic seismic sections allow recognition of F2a and F2b, while F2c can be traced as a separate segment at depth in the high-resolution synthetic seismic (label 8; Fig. 12c).\nScenario 2.4 is a combination of scenarios 2.2 and 2.3, and in addition two small antithetic reverse faults (F2e and F2d) cut the H3 to H4 level (Fig. 12d). The two antithetic faults branch with F2b at 75\u201380\u00a0m depth. The apparent reverse faults are considered normal faults that are rotated in the fault tip monocline. F2a terminates below H4 whereas F2b extends to the top of the model. The antithetic faults are indiscernible even in the high-resolution synthetic seismic section but trigger some disturbances in the reflections (label 9; Fig. 12d). In the high-resolution synthetic seismic, the internal layers in the fault block, between F2a and F2b, are well imaged. F2a is imaged below this fault block. For the conventional synthetic seismic, only F2a can be picked with certainty.\nIn scenario 2.5, a fault lens is bound by segment F2f, in addition to fault segments F2a and F2b (Fig. 12e). There is also an antithetic fault, F2d. In this case the antithetic F2d can also not be identified with certainty, especially in the conventional synthetic seismic section. Further, the fault lens is not expressed in the synthetic seismic sections as it is in the geological model. This may be due to F2f only being picked internally in one layer (between LCU-H3), hence it has the same elastic parameters on both sides of the segment, and therefore there is no acoustic impedance contrast and no response in the synthetic seismic sections.\n\n\n\n4.2.3\nSummary of modelling results\nSeveral observations apply to all fault scenarios (Figs. 10-13\n): (1) In the high-resolution synthetic seismic sections for the scenarios it is easier to detect minor offsets (3\u201310\u00a0m) in the horizons above the main faulted interval. (2) The down-faulted blocks bounded by the two fault segments (F1a-b and F2a-b) have better spatial resolution in the high-resolution data, in which they appear more \u00a8isolated\u00a8 and the internal layers are more distinct. (3) The different fault interpretations between the scenarios can mostly be seen in the high-resolution synthetic seismic sections while it remains hard to detect some of the variations in the conventional synthetic seismic sections (Figs. 10-13).\nSelected scenarios are compared in more detail including difference plots highlighting the difference in synthetic seismic response between interpretations (Fig. 13). The strong amplitude at depth in the difference plot between scenarios 1.2 and 1.3 result from different location of the connection point of F1a and F1b (label I; Fig. 13). In scenario 1.3, they connect at deeper level and the fault block is wider than in scenario 1.2. The difference in the shallow part (c. 50\u00a0m) is due to scenario 1.3 splitting into three segments, which penetrate further up with small offsets of the shallow layers (label II; Fig. 13). The fault geometries in scenarios 2.2 and 2.3 are shifted with respect to each other, and the strong amplitudes at depth in the difference plot are located in between the two fault interpretations (label III; Fig. 13). The same shift can be seen in deeper parts of fault segment F2a giving rise to clear amplitudes in the difference plot (label IV; Fig. 13). This difference is however hard to see in the synthetic seismic sections. There is also a clear difference in the footwall of F2b (label V; Fig. 13). The largest difference is related to the shift of F2b interpretations between the two scenarios. The small offsets of the shallow layers by F2a-c in scenario 2.3 are enough to make a difference in seismic response of the two fault models (label VI; Fig. 13). For scenario 2.3 this can be a potential fluid migration pathway compared to scenario 2.2 \u2013 but this is indiscernible in the synthetic seismic section. Similar considerations can be made by comparing the shallow faults in scenario 1.3 to scenario 1.2 (Fig. 13). All differences described above are easier to recognize in the synthetic high-resolution seismic section than in the conventional synthetic seismic. In the synthetic conventional sections, the differences appear more blurred (Fig. 13).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nOur approach to uncertainties associated with seismic interpretation of normal faults is addressed in three steps. First, we discuss objective and subjective uncertainties of the seismic data itself and seismic interpretation before we compare manual and automatic fault interpretations. Following this, we consider the contribution of our seismic modelling approach to improve confidence in seismic interpretation. Finally, we deliberate on uncertainties in interpretations and highlight challenges and pitfalls that may guide the interpreter's work.\n\n5.1\nSeismic interpretation uncertainty\nSubsurface geology is three-dimensional and detailed mapping requires 3D seismic data. Still, much of the basic seismic interpretation, both of structural and depositional features, are carried out in 2D vertical sections (a combination of inlines, crosslines and arbitrary lines extracted from 3D cubes). An integration of such interpretations, combined with horizontal sections and 3D interpretation tools, result in 3D models of the subsurface. This study focuses mainly on seismic interpretation of 2D vertical sections from two 3D cubes of different seismic resolution (key profiles in Fig. 3e,f). We address challenges related to limitations associated with imaging of faults in 2D seismic sections, due to uncertainties and interpretation pitfalls. Based on the interpretation of the key profiles, geological models are constructed and tested by seismic modelling to shed light on limitations.\n\n5.1.1\nObjective uncertainties\nLimitations in 2D and 3D seismic data coupled with 1D boreholes encompass uncertainty that comes with the seismic image (Schaaf and Bond, 2019). Seismic image quality spans geophysical parameters of the seismic acquisition and the subsequent processing (Botter et al., 2014, 2016), as illustrated in Fig. 2. Quality of the seismic data entails the design of the seismic source, receiver ranges and trace density (e.g., Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018), whereas the associated wavelet (with its frequency band) and the unit velocity limit the vertical resolution to \u03bb\/4 and lateral resolution to \u03bb\/2 (Lecomte, 2008; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018). Accordingly, higher frequency and\/or lower velocity provide better resolution but these are not found at greater depths. The high-resolution dataset utilised in this study has frequencies of around 150\u2013200\u00a0Hz and extend down to 1150\u00a0ms TWT, whereas the conventional 3D data that extend down to 7\u00a0s TWT has frequencies of 20\u201360\u00a0Hz. This corresponds to a vertical seismic resolution of 3\u20137\u00a0m for high-resolution seismic data and 15\u201325\u00a0m for conventional seismic data.\nThe high-resolution P-Cable data are only available for the shallow subsurface, mainly due to rapid attenuation of higher frequencies with depth. The best quality data are derived from above the first seabed multiple in marine seismic data because of challenges related to multiple depression in the short offset P-Cable data (Planke et al., 2010; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018). In the Hoop area in the SW Barents Sea (study area), the water depth is about 450\u00a0m (600\u00a0ms TWT), giving room for high-resolution data down to 1200\u00a0ms TWT (about 900\u00a0m below the seabed). As the structures analysed herein are shallow (upper 500\u00a0m below the seabed), attenuation of seismic energy with depth is limited (Brown, 2011). Besides, changes in velocities within the studied depth interval appear moderate (2.2\u20133.2\u00a0km\/s), limiting impact of burial related compaction on velocity (Bj\u00f8rlykke and Jahren, 2015). Resolution and thus imaging-quality generally decreases with depth, accordingly the uncertainties in picking faults increase with depth (Fig. 4 in Schaaf and Bond, 2019).\nSeismic processing improves the signal-to-noise ratio (Simm and Bacon, 2014), and can sharpen the shape of the wavelet to improve vertical resolution. Migration techniques improve the seismic image of complex geometries both in terms of vertical and horizontal resolution. Impact of processing is exemplified for our 3D conventional dataset, where recent reprocessing with a smaller sampling interval significantly improved the imaging and resolution at shallow depth (the first 1000\u00a0ms TWT; Fig. 2c,d) compared to the dataset utilised by Faleide et al. (2019).\nAcquisition provisions with streamer\/line spacing and shot point interval determine the bin size. For the conventional data, the bin size of 12.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a018.75\u00a0m is the threshold for horizontal resolution in the migrated seismic data, whereas the corresponding threshold for the high-resolution data is constrained by the bin size of 4.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.25\u00a0m. Source to receiver offset controls the incident angle, which in turn has an impact on the reflectivity and resolution (Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018). Thus, increasing the incident angle decreases the resolution of the seismic image. The conventional dataset in this study has a maximum offset of 6180\u00a0m and incident angles typically ranging between 5.1 and 72.1\u00b0 for a target depth at 1000\u00a0m (including 450\u00a0m water). For the high-resolution seismic data, the maximum offset is 163 resulting in an incident angle of 3.3\u00b0- 4.5\u00b0. Finally, line orientation (shooting direction) versus structural dip affects imaging. The illumination angle controls what parts of a dipping structure are imaged in the seismic data, and constrains the lateral resolution (Wrona et al., 2020). Angles of maximum illumination seldom exceed 40\u201350\u00b0 dip, thus hampering the imaging of faults. In this study, the deeper parts of F1 and F2 have dips of about 40\u00b0 (Fig. 10b), which is consistent with the fault plane reflections observed in the synthetic seismic sections in Fig. 10c,d (label 3). The shallower fault segments are steeper, and are not imaged with the given illumination angle (45\u00b0), so these are detected as discontinuities along the nearby reflections.\nThe shadow zone below the two main faults is a potential seismic artefact and interpretation pitfall that adds to the objective uncertainty. This seismic artefact is misinterpreted by many in the test-panel as an antithetic fault below F1a and F2a, which is part of the mean fault model (Fig. 10a,b and Figs. S2.1-S2.2 in supplementary material 2). In this case, there is a link to the interpreters background, as this interpretation seems to be favoured by the non-structural geologists.\nSeismic attributes are used to obtain the best detection and imaging of faults and other geological features (Brown, 2011; Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Mondol, 2015). Seismic attributes do not change\/improve the objective uncertainty but can be used as a beneficial tool to extract more interpretation details out of the seismic data. In this study, variance is used to investigate important structural features in the study area. In time slices through the variance cube there are discontinuities that likely represent fault zones, including signal disturbances in what could be damage zones, similar to those described by Alaei and Torabi (2017). These zones in the variance cube are up to 60\u201380\u00a0m wide. Given the bin size of the 3D high-resolution seismic data (4.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.25\u00a0m), possible damage zones have been sampled up to ten times across the fault zone. This advocates for possibilities to map damage zones in the shallow subsurface; however, this would likely be more challenging for conventional 3D seismic data with less resolution. Attribute-blending can also be a powerful tool to highlight and interpret different structural and depositional features in seismic data. For fault interpretation, a blend of semblance, dip and tensor attributes is recognised as a good combination (Cunningham et al., 2019).\nIn this study, uniqueness is found in overlapping conventional and high-resolution seismic data coupled with well data. By comparing the two seismic datasets, we highlight uncertainties that depend on seismic resolution and image quality. Objective uncertainties diminish as vertical resolution improves from 20\u00a0m to 5\u00a0m between data types. To further test limitations of the seismic data, seismic modelling of 2D geological fault models were applied (see 5.3 below).\n\n\n5.1.2\nSubjective uncertainties\nThe human bias encountered by different workers manually interpreting faults in seismic data, will influence interpretations and geological models (Bond et al., 2012; Bond, 2015). For instance, faults are best mapped in lines that are perpendicular to the strike of the fault. Human bias is curtailed by geological reasoning and rules that link to attained experience and education as well as current trends in the scientific community (Freeman et al., 2010; Bond et al., 2012, 2015; Alcalde et al., 2017a). In this context, persons in our test-panel are experienced in seismic analysis of faults and\/or stratigraphy, hence minimizing bias by experience and insight into concepts. To avoid a framing bias, the conventional seismic data interpretation was conducted prior to the interpretation of the high-resolution seismic data. Manual fault mapping by the test-panel, as illustrated in Fig. 6 and Figs. S2.1-S2.2 in supplementary material 2, is an unconstrained process that generates multiple interpretations per dataset (Bond et al., 2008; Bond, 2015). For the test-panel, it is reasonable to assume that all interpreters conducted their interpretation based on a conceptual model of extensional fault geometries. The differences between the various interpretations must therefore be ascribed to human bias.\nWe agree with Bond et al. (2007, 2012, 2015) regarding the importance of validating models by considering the geological evolution of the area in light of information from seismic and borehole data. Given the short time allocated for each section in this study, emphasising fault geometries (no horizon interpretation), there is limited critical validation of interpretations. If the test-panel had more time on the task, coupled with familiarity to the area, they would likely present interpretations that are more robust. A common example of subjectivity is that some interpreters favour picking of faults towards the hanging wall cut-off side, while others prefer the footwall side (Michie et al., 2021; Alcalde et al., 2017b). This variability in fault lines (Fig. 6a,b) influences fault heave (Alcalde et al., 2017b), and can affect subsequent studies of the fault stability (Michie et al., 2021).\nFor the high-resolution seismic data, less objective uncertainty may have contributed to less subjective uncertainty in the picking of the main faults compared to the interpretation of the conventional seismic data (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the improved resolution of the high-resolution P-Cable data allows identification of smaller-scale features resulting in an overall more intricate interpretation. Most interpreters picked a number of minor faults in the high-resolution data but their interpretations show considerable variations (subjective uncertainties). The up-section fault picking is clearly subjective with a significant spread in location of fault tips (Fig. 6, Figs. S2.1-S2.3 in supplementary material 2). Most fault picks are based on termination\/offset of strong reflections and the fault-tips are placed accordingly. Others continue tracing of the faults upwards\/downwards into intervals with less reflectivity, partly based on geological reasoning. The choice of fault tips has, for instance, implications for the projected fault-growth history.\n\n\n\n5.2\nMachine-based automatic seismic interpretation\nHuman bias can be countered by machine-based interpretation techniques (e.g., Huang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018, 2019; Schaaf and Bond, 2019) that follow pre-defined protocols, placing the objective uncertainty as the key challenge. Interpreter #21 was included to test how one method of machine-based automatic fault interpretation performs in comparison to the manual picks of the test-panel (Fig. 9). As each interpreter presents non-unique results through several trials, different algorithms and different trained neural networks will also work differently. However, in the presented case, the same trained network is applied on both the high-resolution and conventional seismic data. This allows objective assessment of impacts derived from input data, demonstrating how the exact same interpretational method produces different results from the two seismic volumes.\nThe two results of machine-based automatic interpretations are somewhat consistent, showing the two major faults, although the high-resolution results are more detailed, continuous and deeper. Compared to the manual interpretations faults appear more segmented (Fig. 9). This can be explained by the small size of the synthetic cubes used for the unsupervised training of the model, favouring smaller isolated fault segments rather than a major through-going fault. The fault identification appears partly conservative due to a reliance on the termination of strong reflections.\nLimitations with machine-based fault identification are related to the training data used to pre-condition the network. Although different reflectivity models, different seismic frequency content and noise, and different types of fault geometries were included in the training data, the synthetic data fail to cover all fault scenarios. For instance, the training data have abrupt reflection terminations, which are not necessarily the case in actual data. Therefore, with improved training data the machine-based fault identification would likely perform better.\n\n\n5.3\nSeismic modelling\nSeismic modelling was utilised herein to test the effects of subjective and objective uncertainties, addressing the limitations in resolution and illumination of the seismic data. Most similar studies have targeted outcrop scenarios which are void of errors associated with depth conversion, and provide a high level of details in exposed parts of the outcrop (e.g., Botter et al., 2017; Lecomte et al., 2015; Anell et al., 2016; Kjoberg et al., 2017; Eide et al., 2018; Rabbel et al., 2018; Lubrano-Lavadera et al., 2018; Wrona et al., 2020). Seismic modelling is integrated to explore the detection threshold of faults in both types of seismic data, as the method highlights the details which may be detected and eventually resolved in different types of seismic data (limit of visibility vs limit of separability). Synthetic seismic sections based on models also incorporating details known from outcrops offer the interpreter guidance around viable geometries in work with actual seismic data.\nIn this study, the models are based on interpretation of the high-resolution seismic data providing more details than in the conventional data. Still, the level of details in the geological model has limitations (because of the objective and subjective uncertainties of the seismic data). On the other hand, the relevance of the models is secured since they describe the subsurface of the study area. Adding field analogues (outcrops) as basis for detailed geological models will always be questionable regarding the relevance and comparability to the subsurface case. Another challenge relates to establishing relevant petrophysical parameters for the geological model based on outcrop geology. Rock properties of samples from outcrops are rarely representative for a subsurface case, compared to parameters of geophysical logs as available for the study area.\nA test of all geophysical parameters applicable to seismic modelling is beyond the scope of this study; as such we use parameters that are appropriate for the two datatypes utilised herein. Different incident angles and wavelets (dominant frequencies; Fig. S1.1 in supplementary material 1) are used for each seismic dataset reflecting their characteristic acquisition parameters and the corresponding resolution (Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018). The same illumination angle of 45\u00b0 was applied, corresponding to standard seismic illumination (Rabbel et al., 2018).\nPrevious studies identify significant improvement of the seismic image increasing frequency from 10 to 20\u00a0Hz to 30\u201340\u00a0Hz (Botter et al., 2014; Anell et al., 2016). A frequency range of 90\u2013150\u00a0Hz, representative for the high-resolution data in this study, reveals a distinct width and internal layering in the down-faulted block (Figs. 10-13). The high-resolution seismic data, through interpretation, depth conversion and model building, form the fundament for the 2(3)D PSF-based convolution seismic modelling that we used to examine fault scenarios herein (Figs. 5 and 7). Subjective interpretation uncertainty (Fig. 6) and objective challenges guided the derived mean geological model (Fig. 10) and the scenarios representing the variability of F1 and F2 interpretations (Figs. 11-13). All interpretations exhibit the two main fault segments (F1a,b in Fig. 11; F2a,b in Fig. 12; Figs. S2.1 and S2.2 in supplementary material 2), while they vary in fault length, position and number of branching points, and the number of smaller fault segments.\nThe interpretation of fault termination positions are highlighted in scenarios 1.1 and 1.2 (Fig. 11). Here, the fault terminations are placed at different levels within the LCU-H3 interval but these differences are not reflected in the geological layered models and therefore not seen in the synthetic seismic sections. In the models the terminations are linked to a specific horizon and the offset of this horizon provides the criteria for identifying the fault (e.g., Bahorich and Farmer, 1995; Alcalde et al., 2017b). Hence, marker truncations are key, which points to a larger component of subjective criteria in intervals with weak or no reflections. Besides, smaller fault displacements near or below geophysical detection thresholds can in many cases only be noticed by disturbances in otherwise continuous reflections. This creates a significant uncertainty in the outcome of the test-panel's interpretations, and clearly appears as a challenge for the machine-based automatic fault interpretation (Fig. 9). The latter however adjusts the sensitivity to interval signatures, thereby identifying faults that are missed in the manual picks.\nDistortion of reflections is a major uncertainty associated with faults, which is especially noticeable in the conventional seismic data (Figs. 10-13). This effect is most prominent between closely spaced fault segments where normal drag of layers towards faults is apparent. Most interpretations produced by the test-panel vary significantly with respect to choices around open relays or fault branch points (Fig. 6, Figs. 10-12, Figs. S2.1-S2.2 in supplementary material 2). As the geological models show (Figs. 11 and 12), there are clear-cut truncations and limited flexing of beds\/horizons. Hence, the distortion of reflections combines a lack of illumination of the fault planes (too steep) coupled with poor lateral resolution of the seismic data. Thereby, proposed fault tip monoclines from vertically segmented faults, albeit seen in nature (e.g., Sharp et al., 2000; Braathen et al., 2011), must be considered with caution in seismic imaging of faults. An interesting point here is that machine-based interpretations of Fig. 9 show more vertically segmented faults. Thereby, this method does not clearly falsify the monocline model.\nNoise was added to tentatively match the background pattern of original seismic images, in an approximation of acquisition and processing\/imaging noise. The random noise generated for superposition onto the synthetic seismic sections was in addition computed on the same grid (size and sampling) as the geological models, i.e., with a dense sampling of 1\u00a0m horizontally and 0.2\u00a0m vertically, while the original seismic data are on much coarser grids. This gives a noise model that may offer a higher spatial variability compared to the actual seismic data. In-depth analysis of the noise in actual seismic datasets and improved methods for implementation in synthetic seismic data, could allow additional insight to fault analyses and processing techniques.\n\n\n\n6\nSummary and conclusions\nThis study addresses seismic interpretation of faults, highlighting limitations and potential pitfalls due to objective and subjective uncertainties. This knowledge can guide risking workflows that must take account of significant uncertainty in fault models, which is carried forward to fault analysis techniques such as juxtaposition analysis, quantitative fault seal analysis, and fault stability analysis. The main findings are:\n\n\u2022\nObjective uncertainties decrease when high-resolution seismic data is available in addition to conventional seismic data.\n\n\n\u2022\nSubjective uncertainties from human bias will always influence interpretation results; statistical analysis and sorting of fault interpretations shows significant variations between manually picked faults.\n\n\n\u2022\nSeismic uncertainties will always be present when working with subsurface data but efforts should be done to minimize their effects on the interpretations. Some efforts have been outlined in this paper.\n\n\n\u2022\nIdentifying fault tips in seismic data is challenging and smaller antithetic faults are rarely recognizable.\n\n\n\u2022\nMasking of closely spaced fault segments by distorted reflection signatures creates apparent extensional fault tip monoclines. This effect is higher for conventional versus high-resolution data.\n\n\n\u2022\nSeismic modelling shows which details may be detected and eventually resolved in different types of seismic data.\n\n\n\u2022\nMachine-based automatic fault interpretation is void of subjective bias and speeds up initial interpretation significantly, but is still subject to objective uncertainties inherent in seismic data (resolution limitations).\n\n\n\u2022\nThis study demonstrates how interpretation of high-resolution seismic data, combined with seismic modelling, can increase confidence in the interpretation of conventional data from the same area.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit author statement\nFaleide: Responsible for conception and design of the work, data collection, data analysis and interpretation; writing, figures, editing and revising the manuscript.\nBraathen: Contributed to design and conception of the work, helped in developing and maturing ideas, discussion of results and state of the art, commenting\/editing the manuscript.\nLecomte: Advised during the seismic modelling.

The thin-skinned JFTB evolved above a pre-structured basement, which affected the deformation style of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary cover (Homberg et al., 2002; Laubscher, 1986, 1961; Malz et al., 2019; Philippe et al., 1996; Tschanz, 1990). Pre-existing basement structures frequently controlled the formation of cover structures that are oblique to the JFTB transport directions (Laubscher, 1961). Although obscuring most underlying basement structures, the JFTB is full of inherited strike directions, which highly motivated us to study the formation of complex fold and thrust arrangements.\nThe aim of this study is to understand the kinematic and mechanic conditions of basement-controlled structures in the detached cover of the JFTB. First, we present brittle-viscous sandbox analogue-models that explore the spatial and kinematic evolution of a brittle sand cover above a viscous detachment, migrating across oblique and frontal basement steps associated with the reactivation of inherited faults. Thereafter we compare structures observed in our analogue models with natural examples from the JFTB. Although we study the case of the thin-skinned JFTB in the first place, our model results may be applied to other fold-and-thrust belts worldwide that deformed above pre-existing basement structures. Some examples among others, where inherited structures are proposed to have exerted an important structural control, are the Taiwan orogen (Yang et al., 2006, 1996), the Apennines (Coward et al., 1999; Tavarnelli, 1997), the Zagros Mountains (Berberian, 1995) and the Prebaetic System of the Baetic Cordillera in Spain (Peper and Cloetingh, 1992).\n\n\n2\nRegional setting\n\n2.1\nJura Mountains fold-and-thrust belt\nThe Jura Mountains are an arc-shaped mountain range of ~300\u00a0km width and a transect length of ~75\u00a0km at its centre (Fig. 1a). The Mesozoic and Cenozoic cover of the Jura Mountains and the western Molasse Basin (Fig. 1a, b) was detached in Triassic evaporites and transported north-westwards, which was proposed by Buxtorf (1907, 1916) and Schardt (1908) based on observations in railway tunnels and because no rocks exposed in the JFTB pre-date a Triassic age. Several decades later, boreholes and seismic lines within the detached Molasse Basin and the Jura Mountains confirmed the existence of a regional basal d\u00e9collement in Triassic evaporites (Burkhard, 1990; Jordan, 1992; Jordan and Nuesch, 1989; Laubscher, 1961; Lienhardt, 1962; Michel et al., 1953; Sommaruga, 1997). The basal detachment of the JFTB is very probably connected with the Alpine sole thrust in the south-east, that roots beneath the External Crystalline Massifs (ECMs) of the Alps (Burkhard, 1990; Bellahsen et al., 2014, Fig. 1b), namely the Belledonne, Aiguilles-Rouges, Mont-Blanc, Aar and Gotthard Massifs (Fig. 1a). Therefore, the evolution of the JFTB and the exhumation of the ECMs were coupled and contemporaneous (Becker, 2000; Burkhard, 1990; Laubscher, 1986). From structural relations of Tertiary sediments across the Jura Mountains, the main folding and thrusting of the JFTB occurred between about 12 and 4\u00a0Ma (Becker, 2000 and references therein), which we consider the thin-skinned main formation stage of the JFTB. However, the basal d\u00e9collement of the JFTB and Molasse Basin was active before (Deville et al., 1994; Leloup et al., 2005; Looser et al., 2020). From the thermal and structural evolution of the ECMs, Leloup et al. (2005) concludes that the Alpine sole thrust (see Fig. 1b) prolonged into the Triassic evaporites beneath the Molasse Basin by ~15\u00a0Ma at the latest. This is supported by recent U-Pb dating of calcite veins in the Schafisheim-1 borehole situated in the Molasse Basin west of Z\u00fcrich (see position in Fig. 1a) that shows activity of the basal d\u00e9collement at 14.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0Ma (Looser et al., 2020).\nThe JFTB is classically divided into a highly deformed internal tectonic domain and a considerable less deformed external part (Chauve and Perriaux, 1974; Tr\u00fcmpy, 1980, Fig. 1a). The strongly deformed Internal Jura or High Jura (Fig. 1) shows maximum northwest displacements of about 30\u00a0km (Affolter, 2004; Laubscher, 1965; Philippe et al., 1996), featuring well-developed ramps and fault-propagation folds that partially led to kilometric duplication of the Mesozoic cover (Fig. 1b, Winnock, 1961; Aubert, 1971; Sommaruga, 1997). The less deformed External Jura is subdivided into narrow zones of localised deformation called \u201cfaisceaux\u201d (meaning \u201cbundles\u201d in English) and scarcely folded and intact plateaus (Fig. 1a). These plateaus are blocks of Mesozoic carbonates, each several hundred square kilometres large, embedded within the faisceaux (Fig. 1a).\nThe front of the JFTB is controlled by rift segments of the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS, D\u00e8zes et al., 2004; Lacombe and Bellahsen, 2016; Madritsch et al., 2008; Malz et al., 2016; Ustaszewski and Schmid, 2006; Ziegler, 1992), i.e. the Bresse Graben (BG) to the west and the Upper Rhine Graben (URG) to the north, connected by the Rhine-Bresse Transfer Zone (RBTZ, Fig. 1a). Therefore, faisceaux at the front of the JFTB follow extensional structures of the ECRIS (Bi\u00e8vre and Mercier, 2010; Chauve and Perriaux, 1974; Glangeaud, 1951; Lienhardt, 1962; Martin and Mercier, 1996; Michel et al., 1953; Philippe et al., 1996).\n\n\n2.2\nMechanical stratigraphy\nThe mechanical basement of the JFTB (footwall) encompasses the geological units beneath the basal d\u00e9collement in Triassic evaporites. Apart from the crystalline basement, this includes Permian and Carboniferous continental sediments deposited within troughs in the crystalline basement as well as the Triassic series beneath the basal d\u00e9collement (Fig. 2\n). The evaporite d\u00e9collement of the JFTB concentrated predominantly in halite-bearing layers (Deville, 2021; Sommaruga et al., 2017), deposited in shallow basins on an epicontinental platform (Lienhardt et al., 1984; Philippe et al., 1996). Salt occurs mainly in Upper Triassic evaporites (Keuper group) in the Central and Southern Jura and mostly in the Middle Triassic series (Muschelkalk group) in the Eastern Jura (Debrand-Passard et al., 1984; Guellec et al., 1990; Jordan, 1992; Laubscher, 1986, 1961; Philippe et al., 1996; Sommaruga et al., 2017).\nThe stratigraphy in Fig. 2 is representative of the Central Jura, where the d\u00e9collement is predominantly localised in Upper Triassic evaporites (Laubscher, 1961; Philippe et al., 1996). We estimate a d\u00e9collement\/cover thickness ratio of about 1\/8, assuming the Upper Triassic salt system to be the basal d\u00e9collement (Fig. 2). However, anhydrite layers present throughout the Triassic series were at least partially involved in the d\u00e9collement (Jordan, 1992; M\u00fcller et al., 1981), leading to a d\u00e9collement\/cover thickness ratio of ca. 1\/5 (Fig. 2). This ratio increases even more towards the front of the JFTB, where the detached Mesozoic cover is extensively eroded due to Eocene to Oligocene rift-shoulder uplift associated with the formation of the ECRIS (Illies, 1972; Michon, 2000) and forebulging of the peripheral Alpine foreland basin (Burkhard and Sommaruga, 1998; Laubscher, 1992). Although detachments in the overlying Jurassic and Cretaceous series can occur locally (Malz et al., 2019; Noack, 1995; Nussbaum et al., 2017; Philippe et al., 1996; Schori et al., 2015, see Fig. 2), we focus on the role of the main basal Triassic d\u00e9collement in this study.\n\n\n2.3\nInherited basement faults\nIn the URG and Vorfaltenzone (Fig. 1a), numerous studies of seismic lines, boreholes and gravimetry provide well-constrained insights into faults affecting the basement, with structural orientations being frequently associated with the Variscan orogeny and post-Variscan collapse (Egli et al., 2016; Hauber, 1993; Illies, 1972; Larroque and Laurent, 1988; Laubscher, 1982; Madritsch et al., 2018; Madritsch et al., 2009, 2008; Madritsch and Deplazes, 2014; Philippe, 1995; Rat, 1974; Rotstein et al., 2005; Ustaszewski, 2004). There are three main Palaeozoic trends present (Illies, 1962; Reisdorf and Wetzel, 2018; Schumacher, 2002), which originate from NNE-SSW (\u201cRhenish\u201d, N010\u00b0-N020\u00b0) striking Variscan sinistral shear zones, NW-SE (\u201cHercynian\u201d, N120\u00b0-N130\u00b0) striking Variscan dextral shear zones and ENE-WSW (\u201cErzgebirgian\u201d, N070\u00b0-N080\u00b0) striking Variscan dislocation zones (Fig. 3a). Some of these Palaeozoic fault zones were transpressionally or transtensionally reactivated during the Mesozoic opening of the Alpine Tethys, as well as during the evolution of the ECRIS and the Alpine flexural foreland basin system in Cenozoic times (Illies, 1962; Laubscher, 1986; Madritsch et al., 2009; Meier, 2010; Reisdorf and Wetzel, 2018; Schumacher, 2002; Wetzel et al., 2003; Ziegler, 1988a; Ziegler and D\u00e8zes, 2007). This led to: (1) depositional differences of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments along fault zones, (2) mechanical heterogeneities in the deformed sedimentary cover and (3) substantial vertical offsets of the basement and the cover. In this paper, we test the influence of the latter two predispositions on the evolution of the JFTB.\n\n\n2.4\nLineaments in the Jura Mountains\nIn the Eastern Jura, folds frequently deviate from ideal cylindrical geometries, being bow-shaped, sigmoidal shaped or simply oblique to the transport direction of the JFTB in map view (Allenbach and Wetzel, 2006; Laubscher, 2008a; Meier, 2010). Such anomalous fold axes connect to lineaments with a rough NNE-SSW (Rhenish) orientation (Fig. 3a, b). The existence and implications of Rhenish lineaments in the Eastern Jura have been debated for more than a century (Laubscher, 2008a; Steinmann, 1892). Nowadays, anomalous fold orientations in the Eastern Jura are interpreted as thin-skinned structures pre-conditioned by NNE-SSW striking normal faults in the basement, that are southward continuations of Eo-Oligocene URG faults (Allenbach and Wetzel, 2006; Boigk and Sch\u00f6neich, 1974; Laubscher, 2008a, 2008b; Meier, 2010; Steinmann, 1902), forming preferentially along Palaeozoic Rhenish structural trends.\nAlso in the central External Jura, the Mesozoic cover deformed along lineaments (see Fig. 3c), which are oblique to the general northwest-directed tectonic transport of the JFTB. In Fig. 3c, lineaments strike NE-SW, NNE-SSW (Rhenish) and ENE-WSW (Erzgebirgian). Along these lineaments, we observe alignments of short, dissected folds (Fig. 3c). Analogous to the situation in the Eastern Jura (Fig. 3b), we propose that lineaments in Fig. 3c are the consequence of aforementioned pre-existing basement steps, which controlled deformation of the detached cover during formation of the JFTB.\n\n\n\n3\nExamples of basement-fault related structures\n\n3.1\nBasement-fault controlled frontal faisceau\nThe Ferrette Zone is a faisceau at the front of the Eastern Jura (see Fig. 1a for location). Thrusts at the front of the Ferrette Zone strike NNE-SSW and abruptly turn into a rough E-W direction (Fig. 4a). Structural analysis (Ustaszewski and Schmid, 2006 and references therein) reveals two intersecting fault systems in the basement, which are oriented NNE-SSW and E-W (Fig. 4a). Both systems formed during Eo-Oligocene rifting related to the formation of the URG and provided downward steps during formation of the JFTB, localising deformation in the Mesozoic cover (Fig. 4b). Note that downward steps in the Pre-Mesozoic basement controlled the formation of the two anticlines in Fig. 4b.\n\n\n3.2\nBasement-fault induced cover structures\nTo the west of the JFTB, in the autochthonous Bresse Graben close to Cormoz (Fig. 1a), Bergerat et al. (1989) interpreted an ECORS seismic line, showing a relatively steep normal fault of 75\u00b0 in the crystalline basement, above which a reverse fault disrupts the Mesozoic cover (Fig. 5a). There is also a minor extensional collapse in the Jurassic series, above the higher western basement block. The Triassic salt system accommodates offsets in the basement (Fig. 5a). Normal faults in the basement that induce reverse faults in the cover are also documented in the URG (Ustaszewski et al., 2005), north of Ferrette (Fig. 5b, for location see Fig. 1a). Note that the cross-sections in Fig. 5 show extensional systems in connection with graben formation of the ECRIS, but the dominant structures in the Mesozoic cover are reverse faults (Fig. 5). We also like to point out that basement faults in Fig. 5a do not continue as a single fault into the cover. The salts in Fig. 5a distribute basement induced deformation, i.e. decoupling (e.g. Withjack and Callaway, 2000), causing different structures in the cover than in the basement.\n\n\n\n4\nWorking hypothesis\nOur working hypothesis states that during JFTB formation, deformation of the Mesozoic cover was influenced by offsets along pre-existing basement faults resulting in thrust ramps. Since basement faults were inherited, they were usually oblique to the JFTB transport direction and a variety of oblique, lateral and frontal ramps resulted from the interaction of the cover with basement faults (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, depending on the relative vertical offset of basement faults, the d\u00e9collement had to ramp upwards (Fig. 6b) or downwards (Fig. 6c) to compensate for higher or lower basement positions respectively.\nIn order to test the influence of basement faults on the structures in the JFTB, we performed a series of analogue model experiments, in particular testing different throws and strikes of basement faults.\n\n\n5\nMaterial and methods\n\n5.1\nMaterial properties in analogue models\nWe apply a 1:20,000 model-to-nature scaling ratio for our brittle-viscous models, so that 70\u00a0mm thick dry quartz sand simulates ca. 1400\u00a0m of uniform brittle Mesozoic cover. One model tested a reduced cover of 40\u00a0mm (corresponding to 800\u00a0m in nature). The sand has a homogeneous density (\u03c1) of ca. 1560\u00a0kg\/m3 when sieved from 30\u00a0cm height (Klinkm\u00fcller et al., 2016), its grain size (\u00f8) ranges between 60 and 250\u00a0\u03bcm and its angle of internal friction is 36.1\u00b0 (Zwaan et al., 2016, 2018a, see Table 1\n). The sand surface is flattened with a scraper at every centimetre during model preparation. One model is scanned using X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT), for which we create a layering visible on CT-imagery by adding a very thin corundum layer (< 1\u00a0mm) on top of the sand pack after each scraping. The corundum sand has a density (\u03c1) of 1890\u00a0kg\/ m3, grain sizes (\u00f8) between 88 and 125\u00a0\u03bcm and an angle of internal friction of 37\u00b0 (Panien et al., 2006). A viscous layer of about 13\u00a0mm thickness represents a 260\u00a0m thick basal d\u00e9collement zone of weak Triassic salt layers (Fig. 2). The viscous material consists of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, type Dow Corning SGM-36) and corundum sand, mixed in a one-to-one weight ratio. The mixture density (\u03c1) is ca. 1600\u00a0kg\/m3, close to the density of the quartz sand (Table 1), and has a near-Newtonian rheology with a viscosity (\u03b7) of 1.5\u00b7105\u00a0Pa\u00b7s given our model strain rates (Zwaan et al., 2018b). This way, the density profiles of the models correspond to conditions in the Jura Mountains, where Upper Triassic salt systems are usually associated with various contents of clay, anhydrite and gypsum, and relatively dense compared to pure halite (Bergerat et al., 1990, see Table 2\n). The density profile of our models also prevents diapirism, taking account of the general absence of salt diapirs in the JFTB.\n\n\n5.2\nModel scaling\nAnalogue models are scaled with the equation \u03c3\u204e=\u03c1\u204eg\u204eL\u204e (Eq. 1, King Hubbert, 1937; Ramberg, 1981) where \u03c3\u204e, \u03c1\u204e, g\u204e and L\u204e represent the ratios of stress, density, gravity and length between the model and the natural example. The gravity ratio is g\u204e\u00a0=\u00a01 and the density ratio \u03c1\u204e corresponds to ca. 0.6 (Table 2), so that \u03c3\u2217\u00a0=\u00a00.6L\n\u2217, where L\u204e is set to 1\/20,000. The viscometric function \u03c3\u2217\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b7\u2217\u03b5\u0307\u2217 (Eq. 2, Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986) is used to calculate the strain rate ratio (\u03b5\u0307\u204e), where \u03b7\u204e is the viscosity ratio and the equation \u03b5\u0307\u2217\u00a0=\u00a0v\n\u2217\/L\n\u2217 (Eq. 3) provides the velocity ratio (v\u204e).\nIn nature, the viscosity of pure dry halite is around 1018\u00a0Pa\u00b7s, whereas the effective viscosity of halite with small grain sizes at high temperatures is 1017\u00a0Pa\u00b7s, ranging up to 1020\u00a0Pa\u00b7s for large grain sizes at low temperatures (van Keken et al., 1993). Present-day maximum overburden of the basal d\u00e9collement level in the Jura Mountains hardly exceeds 2.3\u00a0km (e.g. borehole Treycovagnes-1 in Sommaruga, 1997; Sommaruga et al., 2012), which at a temperature gradient of 35\u00a0\u00b0C \/ km calculates to relatively low maximum temperatures of about 80\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, the Triassic salt systems of the Jura Mountains commonly contain various amounts of clay, anhydrite and gypsum, which further increases the viscosity of the salt. We therefore aim to simulate a rock salt d\u00e9collement with an elevated viscosity (> 1018\u00a0Pa\u00b7s).\nThe maximum displacement of the central Jura Mountains is about 30\u00a0km (Affolter, 2004; Laubscher, 1965; Philippe et al., 1996). Since the main Jura formation stage lasted roughly 8\u00a0Ma (Becker, 2000), we estimate an average natural displacement velocity of 3.75\u00a0mm per year. We adjust the model velocity accordingly to 10\u00a0cm\/h to obtain a velocity ratio (v\u204e) of 2.34\u00b7105 (Table 2). This translates to a strain rate ratio (\u03b5\u0307\u204e, see Eq. 3) of 4.67\u00b7109, which in turn yields an appropriately high viscosity (\u03b7) of 2.34\u00b71019\u00a0Pa\u00b7s for the simulated salt system (Eq. 2). The time ratio is calculated with t\n\u2217\u00a0=\u00a01\/\u03b5\u0307\u2217 so that one model hour corresponds to 533 kyr in nature (Table 2).\n\n\n5.3\nExperimental set-up\nThe experimental apparatus is 117\u00a0cm long for frontal step experiments and 113\u00a0cm long for oblique steps and flat-base models, at a constant width of 50\u00a0cm (Fig. 7a). The sandbox frame consists of 2.1\u00a0cm thick rigid pine-plywood with two mobile parts: a horizontal mobile frontal baseplate and a vertical mobile backstop (Fig. 7b). The bottom of the apparatus includes two baseplates (Fig. 7a, b). The baseplate underneath the backstop remains fixed whereas the horizontal mobile baseplate to the front can be moved vertically with maximum offsets of 20\u00a0mm (400\u00a0m in nature) upwards or downwards. An upward offset of the frontal baseplate constitutes an upward step in the direction of transport, whereas a downward offset produces a downward step (Fig. 6b, c). By using different baseplate configurations, the orientation of the plate contact is varied, specified as angle \u03b1 that gives the deviation from a frontal step (Fig. 7a). This allows the simulation of abrupt frontal steps (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0) or oblique steps (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a030\u00b0 and 45\u00b0), analogous to steps in the basement that pre-date JFTB tectonics (Fig. 6).\nThe mobile backstop can be moved horizontally towards the front of the apparatus, with a maximum displacement (Dmax) of 39\u00a0cm (Fig. 7a, b), corresponding to a shortening of 7800\u00a0m in nature. Models featuring frontal steps (except model U10 with a 10\u00a0mm upward step, Table 3\n) are terminated at D\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0cm. Note that we define the left and right hand side of the model apparatus with regard to the displacement direction of the backstop (Fig. 7a). The backstop is installed 1.3\u00a0cm above the fixed baseplate, so that only the sand is compressed without actively squeezing the PDMS\/corundum-sand mixture (Fig. 7b).\nThe sidewalls, front wall, backstop and baseplates are covered with a PVC foil (formerly \u201cAlkor\u201d foil 120,010, now available as \u201cGekkofix 282 11325\u201d, Klinkm\u00fcller et al., 2016) that reduces boundary friction. The angle of dynamic stable friction between sand and foil is about 16.5\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00b0 (Schreurs et al., 2006). Computer-steered motors ensure precise motion of the backstop and mobile plates. The velocity of the backstop and the mobile baseplate is 10\u00a0cm\/h for all experiments.\nWith this experimental set-up, we focus on testing discrete oblique and frontal steps. It is beyond the scope of this study to model the evolution of the whole Jura arc above a fractured basement, or to test local variations of the cover and basal d\u00e9collement (e.g. thickness or rheological changes). The granular material simulating the Mesozoic cover of the JFTB does not allow for modelling overturned forelimbs of anticlines, since the sand collapses at slopes higher than ~35\u00b0. Our models do not include redistribution of granular material by erosion and sedimentation, which can affect the tectonic evolution of structures (e.g. Bonnet et al., 2008; Ca\u00ebr et al., 2018).\n\n\n5.4\nModelling procedure\nEvery experimental run starts with a flat baseplate setting. The PDMS\/corundum-sand mixture is filled in and a minimum of two days of resting time ensures an even distribution of the viscous layer. The sand layers are sieved in afterwards. A 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0cm grid of dark corundum sand (Table 1) is added to the final sand surface, which allows tracking surface displacements and rotations (Fig. 7c).\nModels that contain a step are conducted in two phases: first, the mobile plate is moved upwards or downwards (max. 20\u00a0mm, Fig. 7d). In the second phase (or first and only phase for models without a step), the backstop pushes the sand across the produced step (Fig. 7d). There was no resting time between the two phases. A total of 19 models were completed (Table 3). The models are classified into a downward-step (D), flat-base (F) and an upward-step (U) series (Table 3).\n\n\n5.5\nModel analysis\nBird's-eye perspective photographs of the model surface evolution are taken at 1-min intervals, which translates to a displacement of 1\u2154\u00a0mm between each image (about 33\u00a0m in nature). Videos of all models, except model U20\u201345\u00b0-CT, are provided in the supplementary materials (Schori et al., 2020). After every model run, the sand is removed and the surface of the viscous layer is photographed. Experiment U20\u201345\u00b0-CT is scanned at intervals of 15\u00a0min using a 64-slice Siemens Somatom Definition AS X-Ray CT scanner, located at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Bern. The scanned cylindrical volume of 104.4\u00a0cm length with a diameter of 50\u00a0cm is digitised into 3480 circular slices, each with a diameter of 512 pixels. Slices are scanned at a tube setting of 211\u00a0mA and 140\u00a0kV and exported with an I30 and I70 filter that highlight different parts of the model. We use the software RadiAnt DICOM Viewer V.4.6.8 by Medixant to analyse scans and export cross-sections for illustrations. Note that the viscous layer is poorly distinguishable from the quartz sand in CT-scans and for intermediate model stages (D\u00a0<\u00a039\u00a0cm) of Model U20\u201345\u00b0-CT, the viscous layer is reconstructed based on structural observations after removal of the sand.\n\n\n\n6\nAnalogue model results\n\n6.1\nFlat-base models\nThe flat-base models F1 and F2 serve as a reference for the other models that include a baseplate-step. The first structure in the flat-base models is an imbricate stack that forms in front of the backstop (referred to as backstop imbricate BI, see Fig. 8a-c). The subsequent thrust sheets T1 and T2 forming in front of the BI show leading pop-up structures (Fig. 8c). The BI and thrust sheet T1 are closely spaced and in an evolved stage of T1, its backthrust interferes with the previous structure (Fig. 8c). In each flat-base model, thrust sheets T1 and T2 are identical in their internal architecture and dimension.\nIn order to compare the structural wedge-development of models, wedge-propagation plots are used (Fig. 8d), which show the evolution of the wedge length L (corresponding to the distance between the backstop and the wedge front) with respect to the backstop displacement D (see Fig. 8c for an illustration of parameters). This representation of data was proposed in Strayer et al. (2001) and called G-grams in Mary et al. (2013). Flat-base models F1 and F2 had slightly different viscous layer thicknesses, which are 14\u00a0mm and 15\u00a0mm respectively (~280\u00a0m and\u00a0~\u00a0300\u00a0m in nature). The comparison between flat-base models F1 and F2 (Fig. 8d) shows that the thicker viscous layer leads to longer thrust sheets T1 and T2 (Fig. 8c, d), which in the whole reduces the surface angle of the wedge. This is analogous to critical wedge mechanics (Dahlen, 1990; Davis et al., 1983), where a lower basal friction (i.e. thicker viscous layer) leads to a smaller taper angle of the wedge. Note that thrust fronts of our flat-base models are generally convex to the foreland due to boundary friction at the sidewalls (Fig. 8a), which is characteristic of sandbox-analogue models using a mobile backstop (e.g. Schreurs et al., 2006).\n\n\n6.2\nEvolution of structures related to basement step formation\nDuring vertical movement of the mobile base plate in phase 1, a major reverse fault rooting at the upper step-edge commonly forms in the brittle sand cover. Sub-parallel to that, a minor reverse fault with less offset is seen on CT imagery of model U20\u201345\u00b0-CT, rooting at the lower step edge (Fig. 9a). At a step offset of roughly 10\u00a0mm (200\u00a0m in nature), the major reverse fault appears on the sand surface. Reverse faults are verging towards the lower baseplate and show inclinations between ca. 55\u00b0 and 65\u00b0. At an offset of ca. 15\u00a0mm (300\u00a0m in nature), extensional collapse of the quartz sand occurs above the higher plate (Fig. 9a). Fig. 9a shows structures after 20\u00a0mm (400\u00a0m in nature) upward displacement of the mobile plate. In the case of a 20\u00a0mm downward displacement, structures are the same but mirror-inverted. Note that similar reverse faults and collapse structures induced by basement faults are known from seismic lines (Fig. 5).\nReactivation of phase 1 faults is not observed during subsequent thin-skinned deformation in phase 2 (Fig. 9b, c), which suggests a high friction angle of these pre-existing faults (Ca\u00ebr et al., 2015). Instead, new thrusts with shallower and mechanically favourable angles between ca. 20\u00b0 and 33\u00b0 are formed (Fig. 9b, c). In the case of upward steps with a vertical offset of at least 10\u00a0mm (200\u00a0m in nature), a backthrust temporarily leading the deformation front nucleates in the viscous layer above the upper step edge (Fig. 9b). Only afterwards, the pop-up structure at the front of thrust sheet T1 appears (Fig. 9c). Note that both the fore- and backthrust of the pop-up structure nucleate above the lower baseplate but the fore-thrust traverses the upper edge of the baseplate step (Fig. 9c). Although genetically different, extensional and compressional structures of phase 1 and 2 are controlled by the same baseplate step and therefore, their position is ultimately linked. In the upward-step model in Fig. 9, structures of phase 1 (Fig. 9a) are embedded in the central and frontal part of the pop-up structure of T1 during phase 2 (Fig. 9b, c). The distinct extensional collapse structure of phase 1 remains in the frontal half of the evolving pop-up structure (Fig. 9c).\n\n\n6.3\nFrontal steps (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0)\n\nFig. 10\n shows wedge-propagation plots for frontal-step models (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0). In all plots, we add the graph of flat-base model F1 as a reference, in order to infer the influence of baseplate steps. Furthermore, the calculated surface position of step-controlled fore-thrusts (Fig. 9c) and leading backthrusts (Fig. 9b) are plotted in wedge-propagation plots of Fig. 10 (dotted graphs). If abrupt slope changes of solid black graphs (wedge front) coincide with dotted graphs, the wedge front is likely controlled by the step. Nucleation centres of step-controlled thrusts are assumed according to observations in CT-scans (see fault nucleation lines in Fig. 9b, c).\n\n6.3.1\nFrontal downward-steps\nFrontal downward-step models (Fig. 10a-c) illustrate that with increasing throw of downward steps, thrust sheet T1 forms at less displacement (D) of the backstop and additionally, T1 becomes increasingly larger. In comparison to flat-base model F1, our downward steps therefore lead to a notable forward advancement of the deformation front (Fig. 10a-c). In an evolved stage however, localisation of deformation at the step prevents downward ramping onto the lower baseplate and inhibits an overall propagation of deformation in comparison to flat-base models (Fig. 10b, c).\nAfter the step-controlled front of T1\u00a0has formed in models D10 and D20, backthrusts appear in a backbreaking sequence (see videos in supplementary material, Schori et al., 2020). The overall structure at the front of T1 corresponds to a fault-bend fold with a single thrust-ramp, where backthrusts nucleate (Fig. 11a). The thrust-ramp at the front of T1 roots at the upper edge of the baseplate step and continuous upwards, over the sand of the lower baseplate (Fig. 11a).\n\n\n6.3.2\nFrontal upward-steps\nThe small upward step of 5\u00a0mm (100\u00a0m in nature) in model U05 does not trigger thrusts and the overall wedge propagation plot of model U05 is quite similar to flat-base model F1 (Fig. 10d). Upward steps of 10 and 20\u00a0mm height (corresponding to 200 and 400\u00a0m in nature) localise deformation (step-controlled thrusts), and the deformation front is attracted forwards leading to an enlarged thrust sheet T1 (Fig. 10e, f). In all our upward-step models, a long viscous ramp smoothens the abrupt step between the two baseplates (Fig. 11b) enabling a propagation of deformation onto the higher baseplate (Fig. 11b). Backthrusting becomes increasingly prominent with higher steps (Fig. 10e, f). For one thing, step-controlled leading backthrusts (Fig. 9b) precede the formation of thrust-sheet T1 in models U10 and U20 (Fig. 10e, f). For another thing, the backthrust of the pop-up structure shows concentrated displacement (Fig. 11b) and remains constantly active during shortening of T1. Wedge-propagation plots of models U10 and U20 (Fig. 10e, f) show jagged graphs at the front of thrust sheet T1. This is due to thrust slices that are added at the toe of T1, nucleating beyond the step above the higher frontal baseplate (Fig. 11b). The accretion of thrust-slices distributes deformation among several thrust planes so that individual fore-thrusts absorb notably less displacement than the long-time active backthrust (Fig. 11a). The overall structure at the front of thrust sheet T1 in model U10 is a pop-up with dominant backthrusting (Fig. 11b) and an imbricated front.\nIn contrast to downward steps (Fig. 10a-c), thrust sheet T1 in the upward step models forms at about the same displacement (D) of the backstop as observed in flat-base model F1 (Fig. 10d-f) and therefore, forward advancement of the deformation front is due to enlarged thrust sheets only. Note that frontal-step models do not form thrust sheet T2, except for model U05, where the low upward-step of 5\u00a0mm does not trigger thrusts (Fig. 10d).\n\n\n\n6.4\nOblique downward-step model\nModel D10\u201330\u00b0 is the only experiment featuring an oblique downward-step (10\u00a0mm, at \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a030\u00b0, Fig. 12\n). No downward ramp forms at the transition from the upper to the lower baseplate. Instead, a large fault-bend fold develops that thrusts the sand on the lower baseplate (Fig. 11a). Due to the oblique step, we observe important lateral variations. The deformation front sufficiently close to the oblique step is advanced forward between Y\u00a0=\u00a00 to 30\u00a0cm in Fig. 12a, attracted by the step. As the step controls the deformation front of this segment, the thrust is parallel to the step (Fig. 12a). In flat-base model F1, the position of the regular thrust-front of thrust-sheet T1, which is unaffected by steps, is at X\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0cm (Fig. 12a). The downward-step model forms a relay thrust that connects the regular thrust position and the forward promoted, step-controlled thrust front. This leads to an initial front of T1, which is a composite of two thrusts that are about 84\u00b0 oblique to each other (Fig. 12a). We observe an overall angular deformation front that tapers in the direction of transport. Note that in model D10\u201330\u00b0, no thrust is perpendicular to the direction of displacement (Fig. 12a-c).\nIn our experiment, deformation is step-controlled on the left side (Y\u00a0=\u00a00 to 30\u00a0cm) and afterwards, a thrust slice is added on the right-hand side (Fig. 12b, Y = 25 to 50\u00a0cm). The reverse fault remaining from baseplate-offset in phase 1 is passively transported forwards without significant rotation (see Y = 0 to 25\u00a0cm in Fig. 12a, b). In an evolved stage of the experiment, a new graben structure forms due to extensional collapse roughly in the centre of the large oblique fault-bend fold (Fig. 12c). This graben is sub-parallel to the downward oblique step.\nIn summary, we observe three step-parallel structures, which are (1) a reverse fault related to vertical baseplate offset in phase 1, (2) an oblique thrust-front of T1 on the left (Fig. 12a, b) controlled by the oblique step during phase 2 and (3) a graben forming in response to localisation of deformation at the oblique step in phase 2 (Fig. 12c).\n\n\n6.5\nOblique upward-step models\nIn the two oblique upward-step series with oblique angles (\u03b1) of 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, we vary the step throw between 5 and 20\u00a0mm (Fig. 13\n). All oblique upward-step models form oblique viscous-ramps between the lower and higher baseplates (Fig. 11b). Above these continuous ramps, different oblique structures form in the brittle sand cover. These structures reveal step-controlled thrust segments that nucleate near the baseplate step and are therefore parallel or sub-parallel to the step. With increasing step throw, step-controlled thrusts on the sand surface are more numerous (Fig. 13).\n\n6.5.1\n30\u00b0 oblique-step series\nAt a low oblique upward-step height of 5\u00a0mm (100\u00a0m in nature), thrust sheet T1 remains a continuous structure with virtually no imbrication (Fig. 13a). The frontal thrust of T1 in Fig. 13a is step-controlled on the left, roughly between Y\u00a0=\u00a00 to 15\u00a0cm. In an evolved model stage, this leads to a continuous, bow-shaped front of thrust sheet T1 (Fig. 13a, late stage). Note that flat-base model F1 (Fig. 8a) is notably less bow-shaped than U05\u201330\u00b0 (Fig. 13a), illustrating that the bow shape is not a mere cause of boundary effects.\nModel U10\u201330\u00b0 (Fig. 13b), with a 30\u00b0 oblique-upward step and a throw of 10\u00a0mm (200\u00a0m in nature), develops thrust slices that pinch out laterally and reveal curved fronts, resulting in distinct crescent-shaped structures (Fig. 13b, late stage). These thrust-slices are added at the toe of the wedge, alternatingly on the left and right hand side. Crescent-shaped thrust-slices nucleate in the viscous layer on the upper plate, commonly beyond the step. With increasing throw of the oblique step, curved thrusts become less numerous in favour of angular thrusts (Fig. 13c, d). Therefore, at step throws of 15 and 20\u00a0mm (300 to 400\u00a0m in nature), individual thrust-slices are reminiscent of triangles (Fig. 13c,d). The left side of angular thrusts (left limb of triangle) mirrors the orientation of the step and nucleates at the upper step-edge, thus representing a step-controlled feature (Fig. 13c, d).\nAt the highest oblique upward-step of 20\u00a0mm (400\u00a0m in nature), step-controlled thrust segments are initially sub-parallel to the step (Fig. 13d, early stage), but rotate clockwise with progressive deformation (Fig. 13d, late stage). The thrust segment between Y\u00a0=\u00a020 to 25\u00a0cm in Fig. 13d (early stage), forms as a relay oblique-thrust that is ca. 80\u00b0 oblique to the step and also distinctly oblique to the direction of transport (Fig. 13d). The relay thrust connects the step-controlled thrust front above the upper baseplate with the trailing regular thrust-front on the lower baseplate.\n\n\n6.5.2\n45\u00b0 oblique-step series\nAt step throws of 5 to 15\u00a0mm (100 to 300\u00a0m in nature) in 45\u00b0 oblique-step models, the thrust front of T1 is continuous, but becomes increasingly asymmetric and angular with higher step throws (Fig. 13e-g). The left sides of these continuous thrusts nucleate above the upper step-edge and are step-controlled features (Fig. 13e-g, early stage). Only at a high step throw of 20\u00a0mm (400\u00a0m in nature), the 45\u00b0 oblique-step model shows imbrication of thrust sheet T1 (Fig. 13h).\n\n\n6.5.3\nDifference between 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 oblique steps\nWe observe a fundamental difference between 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 oblique-step models at intermediate step heights of 10 and 15\u00a0mm (200 to 300\u00a0m in nature, Fig. 13b, c, f, g). The overall wedge-length evolution plots of 30\u00b0 oblique-step models show a notable influence of the step (Fig. 14a, b), whereas the wedge-length plots of 45\u00b0 oblique-step models resemble flat-base model F1 (Fig. 14c, d). For one thing, this difference is because 30\u00b0 oblique steps cause a strong frontal imbrication of thrust sheet T1 at a step height of 10 and 15\u00a0mm (Fig. 13b, c), which is not the case for 45\u00b0 oblique steps with the same throws (Fig. 13f, g). For another thing, instead of adding thrust-slices to T1, deformation propagates forwards in the 45\u00b0 models and a new thrust-sheet T2 forms similar to flat-base models (Fig. 14c, d).\n\n\n6.5.4\nLeading backthrusts\nAt 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 oblique upward-steps of 10 to 20\u00a0mm (200 to 400\u00a0m in nature), we observe step-controlled leading backthrusts (Fig. 13) that temporarily constitute the front of the wedge, preceding T1 (also see Fig. 9b, c). In bird's eye perspective, leading backthrusts are relatively long, stretching the entire width of 30\u00b0 oblique-step models (e.g. Fig. 13c, d). They are distinctly step-parallel and become inactive after only 1 to 3\u00a0cm displacement and subsequently, they are dissected during imbrication of thrust sheet T1 (Fig. 13c, d, late stage). Since leading backthrusts are step-controlled features that hardly experience subsequent rotation (Fig. 13d, f), they constitute excellent indicators for the orientation of oblique steps, even in an evolved stage of models (Fig. 13).\n\n\n6.5.5\nLineament rotation\nStep-controlled thrusts start forming on the left side of our oblique-step models and append sequentially along the step (Fig. 15a). This is typically accompanied by crescent-shaped thrust slices that are added on the left wedge front (Fig. 15a, b), seemingly to compensate an asymmetric deformation front, and resulting in an overall thrust front that becomes more perpendicular to the direction of transport. When triangular thrust-slices append, their step-controlled left segments connect to a single lineament (Fig. 15a) that shows an overall clockwise rotation about a vertical axis over time. This rotation is strongest for high upward steps in models U20\u201330\u00b0 and U20\u201345\u00b0, where we measure a rotation of 12\u00b0 and 15\u00b0, respectively of step-controlled fore-thrusts (see Fig. 15a, b).\n\nTable 4\n shows observed rotations at different step throws. In contrast to step-controlled fore-thrusts, step-controlled leading backthrusts do not reveal any noticeable rotations (see Fig. 15a, b, sequence number 2).\n\n\n\n6.6\nCT-scanned oblique upward-step model\nModel U20\u201345\u00b0-CT is a CT-scanned rerun of model U20\u201345\u00b0, featuring a 20\u00a0mm (400\u00a0m in nature) upward-step of 45\u00b0 obliquity. The CT scans allow the reconstruction of cross-sections at different model stages (Fig. 16\n). Raw CT-scan sections interpreted for Fig. 16 are compiled in the supplementary material of this article (Schori et al., 2020).\nStructures of phase 1 (Fig. 16a) are fragmented laterally and at depth during horizontal shortening, and transported forwards embedded in the front of thrust sheet T1 (compare to Fig. 16c and d). In contrast to this, late collapse structures due to sediment stacking are situated at the back of thrust sheet T1 and not at the front (e.g. Fig. 16d, cross-section B4 and C4).\nThe front of thrust sheet T1 is step-controlled on the left side (Fig. 16b, cross-sections D2 and E2) whereas the right hand side is yet unimpeded by the step (Fig. 16b, cross-section A2). By comparison, pop-up structures in cross-sections D2 and E2 (Fig. 16b) lie slightly more frontwards, attracted by the upward oblique-step, which results in an overall curved thrust front, visible on the top view image in Fig. 16b.\nThe thrust-slice added in cross-sections B3 to E3 (Fig. 16c) corresponds to a triangular thrust-slice in top-view images of Fig. 16c, d. Cross-sections C3 and D3 (Fig. 16c) illustrate that on the left side, the triangular thrust-slice nucleates near the step, whereas in C4 to D4 (Fig. 16d), the subsequent crescent-shaped thrust-slice nucleates beyond the step. The backthrust of pop-up structure T1 is permanently active whereas fore-thrusts become inactive when new thrust-slices are added to the front of the wedge (e.g. compare cross-sections A2 to A4, Fig. 16).\n\n6.6.1\nFormation of viscous ramps\nIn all models, viscous material thins out underneath the backstop imbricate fan BI (Fig. 16d), which is the structure showing most sand stacking and therefore, the vertical load exerted on the PDMS\/corundum-mixture by the overburden is highest. Consequently, viscous material flows forward with no material escaping backwards through the gap between the backstop and the baseplate (Fig. 16d). In upward-step models, the forward flowing viscous material accumulates in two locations. First, thickening occurs underneath the front of the pop-up structure of T1 (Fig. 16d, section A4). Secondly, upward steps cause an accumulation of viscous material on the lower baseplate, between the step and the roots of BI, thereby forming a long viscous ramp with moderate inclination (Fig. 16d, C4 to E4). Since the length of the ramp depends on the spacing between the step and BI, the length of the viscous ramp varies laterally (Fig. 16d, C4 to E4) and furthermore, over time with ongoing displacement of the backstop (Fig. 16a to d). Note that if the step-throw exceeds the thickness of the viscous layer (e.g. step height 15 or 20\u00a0mm, 300 or 400\u00a0m in nature), the formation of the viscous ramp ultimately leads to in-situ uplift of a few millimetres. Above the edge of the upper baseplate, the viscous layer thins out down to a few millimetres (Fig. 16d, C4 to E4).\n\n\n\n6.7\nOblique upward-step model with reduced cover\nModel U20\u201345\u00b0-RC tests a 20\u00a0mm (400\u00a0m in nature) oblique upward-step with a reduced sand cover of 40\u00a0mm instead of 70\u00a0mm (Fig. 17a, b). The thinner sand cover leads to shorter and more numerous thrust sheets and generally smaller thrust-slices in comparison to a cover thickness of 70\u00a0mm (Fig. 17c), which is directly related to the geometric relationship between layer thickness and thrust-fault dip-angle (Allemand and Brun, 1991). However, similar step-controlled features as observed in models with a high oblique upward-step and a sand thickness of 70\u00a0mm are present, such as triangular thrust-slices and a step-controlled leading backthrust (Fig. 17a). In the model, an overall sigmoidal structure is the result of triangular thrust-slices of variable size that grow sequentially (Fig. 17a, b). The overall step-controlled front of connected triangular thrust-slices rotates by about 15\u00b0 clockwise (Fig. 17b).\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nSummary of model results\nAn overview of experiments and the first order influence of upward and downward steps is summarised in (Fig. 18\n). Flat-base models (Fig. 18a, b) develop two similar thrust sheets (T1 and T2) with notable less stacking of granular material than observed in step models and there is no imbrication of thrust sheets. Vertical offset of baseplates (Fig. 18c) induces graben structures and reverse faults in the brittle sand cover. During subsequent thin-skinned compression, both downward and upward steps attract and localise deformation, which stimulates a fast forward propagation of deformation in an early stage, but retains the overall deformation in a late stage. Downward steps (Fig. 18d) show exceedingly strong localisation of deformation preventing the formation of viscous downward ramps and overall propagation of deformation onto the lower baseplate. Instead, fault-bend folds nucleating above the upper edge of the downward step form at the front of thrust sheet T1 (Fig. 18d). An oblique downward-step (Fig. 18e) controls the formation of fault-bend folds with oblique frontal thrusts. Numerical and analogue downward-step models of Ca\u00ebr et al. (2018) show that with sufficient shortening at step-controlled thrusts under the right mechanical conditions (high friction angle of cover sediments and low friction angle of d\u00e9collement layers), deformation can propagate onto the lower baseplate.\nThe localisation of deformation at upward steps is less efficient than for downward steps. In comparison to downward steps, upward steps (Fig. 18f) feature smooth viscous ramps that enable a propagation of deformation onto the higher baseplate. Therefore, thickening and thinning of viscous material is observed close to upward steps. The brittle cover shows dominant backthrusts and frontal imbrication (Fig. 18f). Oblique upward-step models (Fig. 18g) reveal a more complex imbrication of brittle structures, featuring asymmetric thrust slices and step-controlled thrust segments that rotate up to 15\u00b0 about a vertical axis. In contrast to this, oblique viscous ramps remain continuous structures.\nHigher oblique steps increase deformation localisation and step-controlled thrust segments become more important, overall leading to angular structures (Fig. 18g, U20\u201330\u00b0 and U20\u201345\u00b0). 45\u00b0 oblique steps cause less localisation of deformation (less imbrication and faster wedge-propagation) than 30\u00b0 oblique steps. Consequently, the efficiency of deformation-localisation does not depend on step height alone, but also on the angle of obliquity (\u03b1) of the upward-step.\nIn summary, the effect of deformation localisation at steps is (i) stronger at high steps than at low steps, (ii) stronger at downward steps than at upward steps and (iii) stronger at frontal steps than at oblique steps.\n\n\n7.2\nComparison to previous oblique-ramp models\nPrevious models on oblique ramps in the Jura Mountains were carried out by Philippe (1995), see Fig. 19a. In contrast to our models, the baseplate geometry in Philippe (1995) provides an enforced, rigid ramp with an inclination of 30\u00b0 (Fig. 19b). The brittle cover is thinner above the higher basal wooden plate (Fig. 19b) and no precursory baseplate-offset phase is simulated. Furthermore, the basal d\u00e9collement is modelled using a thin layer of microbeads (Fig. 19b) and therefore, no viscous flow occurs. However, the top-view pattern of the early stages of the 45\u00b0 oblique-ramp model of Philippe (1995) is very similar to the pattern forming in the 45\u00b0 oblique-step model with reduced brittle cover U20\u201345\u00b0-RC of this paper (Fig. 19c). In addition to 45\u00b0-oblique rigid ramps, Philippe (1995) tested 60\u00b0 oblique ramps as well as lateral ramps (Fig. 19a), showing that with increasing obliquity, triangular thrust-slices disappear in favour of thrust-sheets with a rather straight front perpendicular to the transport direction.\nOur experiments demonstrate that deformation localisation at oblique steps is the reason for triangular structures. Therefore, the absence of such triangles in 60\u00b0 oblique-step models (Fig. 19a) suggests reduced deformation localisation with increasing step-obliquity (\u03b1). Extrapolated, this suggests that lateral steps show the least localisation of deformation and frontal upward-steps the most.\n\n\n7.3\nLocal and regional rotations of structures\nStep-controlled fore-thrusts in our models reveal local rotations about a vertical axis of up to 15\u00b0 over time (e.g. Fig. 17, Fig. 15), related to localisation of deformation at individual baseplate steps. The sketch in Fig. 20\n shows a schematic overview of rotations of step-controlled thrusts deduced from observations in our models, with a transport direction and basement-step orientations matching typical cases in the JFTB. Note that step-controlled oblique structures are local anomalies within a regional trend of structures. The Central and Eastern Jura show a regional clockwise rotation of 7\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 (Laubscher, 1965, 1961), whereas regional counter-clockwise rotation is proposed for the Southern Jura (Affolter, 2004; Philippe, 1994). These regional rotations are more broadly linked to lateral displacement gradients across the Jura arc (Affolter, 2004). Regional and local rotations in the JFTB have a different origin; they were competing and have to be distinguished.\n\n\n7.4\nNatural examples of step-controlled structures\nOur analogue models show that sufficiently high oblique steps ultimately lead to step-controlled oblique structures, such as sigmoidal, curved or angular thrusts viewed from above (e.g. Fig. 17b, Fig. 18g). In the tectonic map of Fig. 21a, we point out exemplary zones in the JFTB, where we propose oblique structures, associated with pre-existing basement faults that acted as structural controls. These zones are described with sketches (Fig. 21b) outlining the proposed tectonic linkage between basement faults and corresponding thin-skinned structures in the cover. Note that sketches in Fig. 21b illustrate thin-skinned structures of the JFTB, which formed during Mio-Pliocene times above a basal d\u00e9collement in Triassic evaporites. Therefore, oblique structures were also transported several kilometres north-westwards after their formation, at least in the Internal Jura (see displacements indicated in Fig. 21a).\n\n7.4.1\nZones I and II \u2013 Pontarlier fault zone and Internal Jura north of La Chaux-de-Fonds\nZone I in Fig. 21a marks the northern termination of the Pontarlier fault zone. Angular thrusts are observed and folds parallel to NNE-SSW trending sinistral strike-slip faults reveal the thrusting component of oblique ramps. We interpret this system as a connection of oblique and lateral ramps that constituted the western lateral limits of thrust-sheets of the Internal Jura (Fig. 21b, zone I). It follows that the Pontarlier sinistral fault zone was contemporaneously active to folding and thrusting, and does not represent a late structural feature of the Jura Mountains. This agrees with previous suggestions by Laubscher (1961).\nZone II to the north of the town of La Chaux-de-Fonds (Fig. 21a) shows angular and overlapping thrusts. Therefore, similar to zone I, we propose NNE-SSW striking oblique basement-steps that triggered the observed structures in the Mesozoic cover (Fig. 21b). The sketch for zones I and II in Fig. 21b correlates with structures of analogue models of Philippe (1995) featuring 60\u00b0 oblique upward-steps, where laterally confined triangular thrust-slices are absent (Fig. 19a).\n\n\n7.4.2\nZone III - Oyonnax-Vuache\nZone III (Fig. 21a) lies in the Southern Jura Mountains and an enlargement is depicted in Fig. 22a. The Vuache fault zone in the southern part of Fig. 22a reveals oblique ramps that are indicative of step-controlled structures and a NW-SE trending basement step. A connection to pre-JFTB tectonic features has also been proposed in previous studies (Laubscher, 1981; Philippe et al., 1996).\nA distinct triple-nappe system south of Oyonnax comprises two triangular nappes and a more crescent-shaped nappe (Fig. 22a), which bears resemblance to our analogue model U20\u201345\u00b0, featuring a 20\u00a0mm (400\u00a0m in nature) 45\u00b0 oblique upward-step (Fig. 22b). In analogy to model U20\u201345\u00b0, we propose a NW-SE trending basement fault for the structures that formed in zone III (Fig. 21b). Within the 45\u00b0 oblique-step series, triangular thrust-slices occur at the highest throw of 20\u00a0mm only (Fig. 13h) and accordingly, we infer a basement step for the natural example of at least 400\u00a0m. This is in agreement with a seismic line interpretation across Oyonnax-Champfromier (Guellec et al., 1990), which reveals a basement high with a throw of several hundreds of metres, SE of Oyonnax (Fig. 22c). Whether this basement high formed by post-Jura inversion or rather represents a horst that predates the Jura Mountains (see tectonic solutions adressed in Guellec et al., 1990), remains debated. However, as thrust geometries in Fig. 22a are strongly suggestive of a pre-existing oblique-step in the basement, our study supports the latter solution. In addition, a direct comparison between the natural example and our analogue model (Fig. 22a, b) suggests a probable structural evolution as depicted in Fig. 22a. Note that a pre-JFTB normal fault in the basement does not rule out a subsequent inversion of the basement in recent times.\n\n\n7.4.3\nZone IV - Chasseral Anticline\nZone IV (Fig. 21a) lies in the Internal Jura and comprises the Chasseral anticline, which contains an oblique fold-segment in respect to JFTB transport directions (see magnification in Fig. 23a). The overall structure in Fig. 23a is remarkably similar to our 45\u00b0 oblique upward-step model with a reduced cover U20\u201345\u00b0-RC (Fig. 23b). The comparison between the model (Fig. 23b) and the natural example (Fig. 23a) suggests that the curved shape of the Chasseral anticline is connected to a NNE-SSW trending basement fault. This supports previous suggestions by L\u00fcthi (1954), Laubscher (2008b) and Meier (2010). We furthermore deduce a high basement step of about 400\u00a0m for the natural example, as the best-fit model U20\u201345\u00b0-RC features a 20\u00a0mm upward step. Based on our model (Fig. 23b), we also deduce a rough relative sequence of structures for the natural example (Fig. 23a). Note that the basement structure that controlled the oblique Chasseral anticline lies between 9.5 and 16\u00a0km to the southeast, according to different displacement models of Affolter (2004) and Philippe et al. (1996), respectively.\n\n\n\n7.5\nSummary of natural structures\nWe propose the presence of pre-JFTB normal faults in the basement with NW-SE (Hercynian) and NNE-SSW (Rhenish) orientations that provided trigger lines for thin-skinned structures in the Internal Jura (Fig. 22, Fig. 23). The orientations of these basement faults suggest Palaeozoic Variscan fault systems, which were reactivated during Mesozoic and Cenozoic times. This led to important basement offsets that controlled the thin-skinned deformation in Miocene and Pliocene times. The tectonic events that come into question for fault reactivations are the opening of the Alpine Tethys rift system in Jurassic times (Stampfli et al., 1998; Ziegler, 1988b), Eo-Oligocene graben formation in connection with the ECRIS (Illies, 1972; Michon, 2000) and Eocene to Miocene evolution of the Alpine flexural foreland basin (Burkhard and Sommaruga, 1998; Laubscher, 1992).\nOur models suggest that basement offsets in the examples in the Internal Jura (Fig. 22, Fig. 23) must reach at least 400\u00a0m in order to control the formation of triangular nappes or thrust-slices during Mio-Pliocene thin-skinned formation of the JFTB. Smaller basement throws rather led to continuous but curved or angular anticlines with few imbrication (e.g. Fig. 13a, e, f, g), such as for example the Graitery anticline in the Eastern Jura (Fig. 3b). Step-controlled structures were displaced up to about 30\u00a0km north-westwards during JFTB formation (Affolter, 2004; Philippe et al., 1996). Therefore, graben structures and reverse faults in the Mesozoic cover, which formed due to pre-JFTB basement extension, are allochthonous and do not overlie their original basement fault.\nBasement structures were undoubtedly present before the formation of the JFTB and controlled thin-skinned structures. In addition, seismic surveys and earthquakes show that the area of the Jura Mountains and surrounding was under the influence of thick-skinned compression after the main thin-skinned JFTB stage until today, which caused local basement inversion (Ca\u00ebr, 2016; Edel et al., 2006; Lacombe and Bellahsen, 2016; Madritsch et al., 2008; Ustaszewski and Schmid, 2007). Recent inversion may be related to tectonic underplating in connection with an equilibration of the Alpine wedge (Mosar, 1999) and\/or lithospheric long-wavelength buckling (Bourgeois et al., 2007; Lefort and Agarwal, 1996).\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThin-skinned deformation of the JFTB during Mio-Pliocene was locally pre-conditioned by steps (faults) in the pre-Mesozoic basement (Laubscher, 1961). By means of brittle-viscous analogue sandbox-models, we study the formation of step-controlled structures. Our models involve the formation of steps between rigid baseplates, overlain by a viscous layer at the base of a brittle sand layer. The brittle sand layer is subsequently pushed horizontally across the step. The following important observations characterise the deformation style:\n\n\u2022\nInitial vertical baseplate offset induces reverse faults and extensional collapse structures in the brittle cover that nucleate at the step and above the higher plate. A reactivation of these initial structures is not observed during subsequent horizontal compression.\n\n\n\u2022\nDuring subsequent horizontal compression, pre-existing steps in the rigid footwall trigger step-controlled thrusts, because they localise deformation in a different position due to stress perturbations. Localisation of deformation results in a fast forward propagation of deformation in an early stage but inhibits propagation later.\n\n\n\u2022\nDownward steps lead to the formation of fault-bend folds with considerable duplication of the brittle cover. In contrast, upward steps control pop-up structures with imbricated fronts, dominant backthrusts and long viscous ramps with moderate inclinations.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe effect of deformation localisation at baseplate steps is stronger at high steps than at low steps, stronger at downward steps than at upward steps and stronger at frontal steps than at oblique steps.\n\n\n\u2022\n30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 oblique upward-steps lead to imbrication with laterally confined thrust-slices. Imbrication and angular thrusts, pointing into the direction of transport, are more abundant with increasing step-height. Angular thrusts are composed of two oblique-thrust segments, with one side that is step-controlled and the other side forming a relay thrust that connects to the regular trailing thrust front. Laterally confined, triangular thrust-slices are characteristic for 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 oblique steps (this study), but they are absent at oblique steps of 60\u00b0 and more (Philippe, 1995).\n\n\n\u2022\nUpward oblique-step models with high step throws of 20\u00a0mm (400\u00a0m in nature) reveal vertical rotations of up to 15\u00b0 of step-controlled fore-thrusts. Step-controlled leading backthrusts hardly rotate and provide excellent indicators for the orientation of oblique steps.\n\n\n\u2022\nFrontward flow of viscous material during thin-skinned deformation has important consequences for upward-step dynamics. In particular, viscous ramps form in front of upward-steps, assisting deformation to propagate onto the upper plate. Subsequently, the viscous ramp ensures the transition of more material onto the upper baseplate without forming new step-controlled structures in the cover. Viscous ramps are dynamic structures, adapting their length laterally (in the case of oblique upward-steps) and over time. Accumulation of viscous material occurs in front of upward steps and towards the front of the wedge. Oblique viscous ramps are large continuous structures whereas the overlying brittle layer may show strong imbrication.\n\n\n\nWe find good correlations of model structures with oblique structures in the Internal Jura (Fig. 22 and Fig. 23). Correlations allow inferring the rough orientation and throw of pre-existing basement steps in nature that controlled thin-skinned deformation. In particular, our models support a NNE-SSW striking oblique upward-step with a throw of 400\u00a0m that controls the Chasseral anticline and a NW-SE striking oblique upward-step with a throw of 400\u00a0m controlling the Oyonnax-Vuache nappe system. Step-controlled structures of the Internal Jura are transported several kilometres north-westwards, away from the basement step that induced deformation. Therefore, step-controlled structures need a palinspastic restoration to identify the position of a corresponding basement step. Model-to-nature comparison of step-controlled oblique structures can also be a powerful tool to assess the relative age of basement structures. An important basement high was for example documented on a seismic line across the Internal Jura (Guellec et al., 1990), but interpretations did not unambiguously reveal whether the basement high formed before or after the JFTB. Correlations with our models strongly support that the basement high predates the JFTB and controlled characteristic oblique structures in the cover. Examples from the JFTB highlight the importance of analysing structures of fold-and-thrust belts in all three dimensions, and our model results may be of use for interpreting fold-and-thrust belts from around the globe.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the University of Fribourg, Department of Geosciences, Earth Sciences, Switzerland; and the University of Bern, Institute of Geological Sciences, Switzerland.\n\n\nA\nSupplementary data\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary material\n\nImage 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nMarc Schori: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data Curation, Writing \u2013 Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing, Visualization; Frank Zwaan: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing - Review & Editing; Guido Schreurs: Resources, Writing - Review & Editing, Supervision; Jon Mosar: Resources, Writing - Review & Editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition.\n\n","198":"","199":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nPre-existing faults and stratigraphic variations commonly play a major role in determining regional evolution during later deformation (Jackson, 1980; Cooper et al., 1989; Williams et al., 1989; Coward, 1994; Buchanan and Buchanan, 1995; Butler et al., 2006). It has been widely described how pre-existing faults control not only the location and kinematics of later structures (i.e., folds and faults) but also the shape and location of orogenic belts and rifts. The structural configuration during the opening of the Bay of Biscay and western Tethys during the Mesozoic has been widely recognized as a key factor that controlled the location and kinematics of the orogenic belts developed in the NE Iberian Peninsula during Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic. Examples of this structural control are found in the Pyrenees (Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; Bond and McClay, 1995; Garc\u00eda-Senz, 2002; Mencos et al., 2015; Mu\u00f1oz, 2017), the Iberian Chain (Salas and Casas, 1993; Guimer\u00e0 et al., 1995; Salas et al., 2001; Nebot and Guimer\u00e0, 2016; Guimer\u00e0, 2018; Aldega et al., 2019), the Columbrets Basin in the Valencia Trough (Etheve et al., 2018; Roma et al., 2018) and the Betic Chain (Calvert et al., 2000; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2002). Nevertheless, the role played by the Mesozoic structures in the Catalan Intraplate Chain (CIC), an orogenic belt also developed NE of the Iberian Peninsula during the Cenozoic (Guimer\u00e0, 1984; Gaspar-Escribano et al., 2004; Juez-Larr\u00e9 and Andriessen, 2006), is not completely understood.\nThe development of the present-day basin-and-range configuration of the Catalan Coastal Ranges (CCR) (Fig. 1\n) resulted from the extensional reactivation of the main Paleogene contractional structures (Fontbot\u00e9, 1954; Gaspar-Escribano et al., 2004; L\u00f3pez-Blanco et al., 2000; Marc\u00e9n et al., 2018). Thus, the presence of pre-existing faults has been considered as a key factor controlling the tectonic evolution of the CCR during the Neogene (Guimer\u00e0 et al., 1995; Roca et al., 1999; Mar\u00edn et al., 2008; Baqu\u00e9s et al., 2012).\nThe control played by pre-Cenozoic structures is still poorly constrained and mostly supported by changes in stratigraphic thicknesses and regional observations (e.g., Esteban and Robles, 1976; Salas and Casas, 1993; Salas et al., 2001). Other studies state the potential Cenozoic reactivation of Mesozoic extensional faults in the region (Roca and Guimer\u00e0, 1992; G\u00f3mez and Guimer\u00e0, 1999) and the control the stratigraphic changes of the Mesozoic succession had in the development of Paleogene contractional structures (Anad\u00f3n et al., 1985; Guimer\u00e0 and \u00c1lvaro, 1990). Moreover, some works based on geochemical analysis in crustal-scale fault damage zones and gouges (i.e., neoformation of minerals, fluid circulation) reveal multiple reactivations in response to the tectonic phases affecting the Iberian Peninsula since the Mesozoic (e.g., Baqu\u00e9s et al., 2013; Cantarero et al., 2014) and even before the Mesozoic (Marc\u00e9n et al., 2018; Aldega et al., 2019).\nIn this paper, we define the structure of a portion of the NW margin of the Montmell-Garraf Basin (Salas, 1987), one of the stratigraphically differentiated rift basins developed in NE Iberian Peninsula Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. This area is characterized by the presence of a strip of Paleogene folds and thrusts, located at the southern prolongation of the major Neogene Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s extensional Fault (Fig. 1). The study is essentially focused on the recognition of the main structural features and the description of the role played by the Mesozoic basin architecture during the Cenozoic tectonic evolution.\nThe work is supported by the construction of two structural cross-sections based on field and well data (Gai\u00e0-Montmell and the Marmellar sections, Fig. 2\n) that allow the delineation of the structures of the uppermost crust. The geometry of the basement and major faults is also sustained at depth by a magnetotelluric (MT) survey carried out along the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section, which yields information on the electrical response of the crust up to about 4\u00a0km depth.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nTectonic setting\nLocated in northeastern Iberian Peninsula, the CCR is a structural unit with a NE-SW-oriented basin and range physiography that extends parallel to the coastline for more than 250\u00a0km (Fig. 1). It is approximately 30\u00a0km wide and, in the present-day, constitutes the onshore expression of the extensional continental margin that separates the thinned crust of the Valencia Trough from the relatively thick crust of the Iberian Plate (Da\u00f1obeitia et al., 1992; Roca and Guimer\u00e0, 1992; Vidal et al., 1995). The CCR is formed by several ENE- to NE-striking basement blocks bounded by 50 to 150\u00a0km-long faults that display a right-stepping en-echelon arrangement (Fig. 1). These major faults mostly dip towards the SE and show reverse, normal and limited left-lateral strike-slip motion (Ashauer and Teichm\u00fcller, 1935; Llopis-Llad\u00f3, 1947; Anad\u00f3n et al., 1985; Guimer\u00e0, 2004). The general structure of the CCR is essentially the result of a multiepisodic and complex Alpine evolution that included: 1) two extensional episodes from Late Paleozoic to Mesozoic, 2) a compressional period during the Paleogene, and 3) an extensional period from latest Oligocene to middle Miocene (Roca and Guimer\u00e0, 1992; Salas et al., 2001; Roca et al., 2004; Mar\u00edn et al., 2008; Baqu\u00e9s et al., 2012).\nThe first extensional episode, Late Permian to Triassic in age, is related to the opening of the Neotethys. The second, latest Oxfordian to Aptian, is related to the opening of the North Central Atlantic and the Bay of Biscay (Salas and Casas, 1993; Salas et al., 2001) that later, led to the uncoupling of the Iberian Plate from the Eurasian Plate during Albian-early Santonian times (Srivastava et al., 1990; Sibuet et al., 2004).\nFrom late Santonian, a faster opening of South Atlantic Ocean produced the northward drift of Africa and, consequently, the convergence and later collision of the recently uncoupled Iberian and Eurasian plates (Srivastava et al., 1990; Rosenbaum et al., 2002). This drastic change in the relative motion of Iberia generated the Pyrenean fold-and-thrust belt from the inversion of the Mesozoic rift-system (Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2002; Mu\u00f1oz, 2017; Garc\u00eda-Senz et al., 2019). In this scenario the contractional deformation progressed southwards leading to the inversion of the Mesozoic rift basins developed in the Iberian Plate and forming the Iberian Range and the Catalan Intraplate Chain (CIC). The preserved structure of the CIC consists of NNW-directed, ENE- to NE-trending thick-skinned and thin-skinned thrusts as well as strike-slip faults (Guimer\u00e0 and \u00c1lvaro, 1990). According to preserved growth strata, the development of the CIC started during Paleocene times and progressed from northeast to southwest up to the middle Oligocene (Guimer\u00e0 and Santanach, 1978; Guimer\u00e0, 1984; Anad\u00f3n et al., 1985). From that moment and up to the middle Miocene, the rollback of the subduction of the Maghrebian Tethys beneath the Iberian Plate produced the extension of the eastern Iberian Plate from the development of widespread back-arc processes (Horv\u00e1th and Berckhemer, 1982; Carminati et al., 1998; van Hinsbergen et al., 2014). This episode led to the formation of the northwestern Mediterranean Basin, which, in the CIC area, developed as result of the extensional reactivation of Paleogene thrusts (Roca, 2001; Gaspar-Escribano et al., 2004; Mar\u00edn et al., 2008; Baqu\u00e9s et al., 2012). The extensionally reactivated faults were responsible of the splitting of the CIC into a set of ENE-WSW blocks bounded by crustal-scale SE- to SSE-dipping extensional faults with kilometric displacements (Bartrina et al., 1992; Roca and Guimer\u00e0, 1992) (Fig. 1). The extension induced the development of a series of basins in the extensional fault hangingwalls filled by more than 4\u00a0km of sediments ranging in age from Oligocene to Recent (Bartrina et al., 1992) and an isostatic rebound in the footwalls up to 1.2\u00a0km (Gaspar-Escribano et al., 2004).\nIn this complex structural setting, the study area is located in the central part of the CCR in the transfer zone of the two major Neogene extensional faults: the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault and El Camp Fault (Fig. 2). This transfer zone is known as the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High, has a right-stepped en-echelon arrangement and is bounded southeastwards by the Baix Pened\u00e8s Fault.\n\n\n2.2\nStratigraphy and thickness variations\nFour stratigraphic assemblages can be distinguished in the study area: the Variscan basement, the Mesozoic cover, the Paleogene fill of the Ebro Basin and Neogene basin infill of the Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin (Fig. 3\n). From a Mesozoic stratigraphy point of view two main domains can be differentiated: the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain in the NW and the Montmell Domain in the SE (Figs. 2 and 3).\nPaleozoic rocks of the Variscan basement have been reported and described at the bottom of the Senant-1 well in the Ebro Basin (Lanaja, 1987; Fig. 1) as well as in the adjoining Miramar Range (Julivert, 1955; Melgarejo, 1987) and Prades High (Figs. 1 and 2). The Paleozoic succession would be made up by Cambrian to Carboniferous slates with thin interbeds of Devonian carbonates (Julivert, 1955; S\u00e1ez and Anad\u00f3n, 1989; Julivert and Dur\u00e1n, 1990) and Upper Carboniferous to Permian granitoids (Serra and Enrique, 1989; Enrique and Sol\u00e9, 2004). The present work assumes similar Paleozoic rocks under the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High, which are considered as the structural basement.\nUnconformably overlying the Variscan basement, the Mesozoic succession shows significant variations across the study area (Figs. 2 and 3). In the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain, the Mesozoic succession is thin and only includes 200 to 350\u00a0m of Triassic rocks (Fig. 3) (Virgili et al., 2006; Gal\u00e1n-Abell\u00e1n et al., 2013; Mercedes-Mart\u00edn et al., 2014). Towards the SE, however, the Mesozoic of the Montmell Domain exceeds 2\u00a0km of thickness (Salas, 1987) and is stratigraphically more complete including Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. On top of the Germanic Triassic, there is a 70\u00a0m-thick unit of uppermost Triassic dolomites, followed by a 300\u00a0m unit of Lower-Middle Jurassic dolomitic breccias and a 1200\u00a0m-thick succession of shallow marine limestones, dolomites and shales of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age (Salas, 1987; Salas et al., 2001; Albrich et al., 2006). The Upper Jurassic-Lower Albian succession is part of a major extensional basin (the Montmell-Garraf Basin) that includes the southern end of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Basin, the Garraf High and some adjacent offshore areas (Anad\u00f3n et al., 1979; Salas, 1987; Salas and Casas, 1993) (Fig. 1). An Upper Albian to Cenomanian sequence of fluvial and shallow marine carbonates complete the Mesozoic record in the Montmell Domain (Salas, 1987; Salas et al., 2001).\nWhereas Paleogene strata are absent in the Montmell Domain, the thin Mesozoic of the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain appears unconformably overlaid by the Paleogene sediments of the Ebro Basin infill. These are 350 to 500\u00a0m-thick marine and continental sediments, and range in age between Paleocene and early Eocene (Ferrer, 1971; Anad\u00f3n, 1978; Colombo, 1986). Towards the northwest, in the undeformed Ebro Basin, the Paleogene succession thickens up to 1.5\u00a0km and includes sediments up to late Oligocene in age (Barber\u00e0 et al., 2001).\nTowards the E and SE of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High, the Mesozoic succession is unconformably overlaid by the basin infill of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s and Baix Pened\u00e8s basins. These sediments are made up by alluvial fan, lagoonal evaporites, carbonate coralgal and fan-delta siliciclastic deposits mainly early to late Miocene in age (Cabrera and Calvet, 1996) unconformably overlaid by Pliocene alluvial sediments (Gallart, 1981) (Figs. 2 and 3).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\nThe present work is based on the construction of structural sections across the area of study using well, field data and later constrained by one 2D magnetotelluric model. Two NW-SE-oriented cross-sections have been constructed in the study area: the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section (Fig. 4\n) and the Marmellar section (Fig. 5\n). The Gai\u00e0-Montmell section is approximately 40\u00a0km long and, from NW to SE, runs from the undeformed Ebro Basin to the Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin (Fig. 2). The Marmellar section is 7\u00a0km long and runs approximately 10\u00a0km east of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section. This second section crosses the southern end of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault at the NE edge of the Montmell Domain (Figs. 2 and 4). The orientations of the sections are respectively N146\u00b0 and N161\u00b0, both orthogonal to the NE-SW predominant trend of the Alpine structures. The cross-sections are based on field data (mostly bedding and fault attitudes), geological map analyses and observed thicknesses of the sedimentary units. When the stratigraphic units do not crop out in the area (e.g., Lower and Middle Triassic), thicknesses have been estimated from the regional reviews of Marzo (1980) and Calvet and Marzo (1994), as well as from information from the Senant-1 and Sant Sadurn\u00ed-1 wells (Lanaja, 1987, Figs. 1 and 3). The Senant-1 well has also been used to define the depth of the basement in the undeformed areas of the Ebro Basin (Fig. 3). The geometry and location of the bottom of the Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin (Fig. 2) has been constrained by the gravimetric studies performed by Hern\u00e1ndez and Casas (1985) and Casas and Permanyer (1991).\nDuring the construction of the cross-sections, projection and extrapolation of dip data were performed defining cylindrical domains and using the kink-band method. The sections have been constructed and balanced using 2Dmove software. To show the tectonic evolution of the area, the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section has been partially restored at the end of (a) the Mesozoic rifting phase, and (b) the contractional Paleogene deformation. During such restorations, the line-length unfold method (Dahlstrom, 1969), which straightens the beds while maintaining constant the line length, was used. Because the sections were constructed using the kink method, layer thicknesses remained constant during the unfolding process. This process allows calculating shortening and stretching value for each of the restored paleo-steps.\nThe magnetotelluric method (MT) has been used to determine the electrical properties of the upper crust across the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section and constrain the structure when possible. The MT is an electromagnetic geophysical method based on the simultaneous measurements on Earth's surface of naturally occurring electric and magnetic fields variations. The relations between electric and magnetic fields at different periods are used to define the impedance tensor whose components provide information about the electrical resistivity distribution at depth (Simpson and Bahr, 2005). This technique is very sensitive to conductive bodies that, in depth, can be associated with the presence of conductive rocks, minerals and partial melts, and also to the presence of fluids. Taking into consideration the marked lithological differences between the stratigraphic sequences present along the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section the main goals of the MT study were: 1) to recognize the geometry of the boundaries between the main stratigraphic and structural units in depth, and 2) to identify basement conductivity anomalies that could denote the presence of damage zones and fluid circulation.\n\n\n4\nStructure of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High\n\n4.1\nGai\u00e0-Montmell section\nThe structure of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High is illustrated in the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section (Fig. 4). The Gai\u00e0-Montmell High relates to the positive relief located between the Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin and the SE margin of the Ebro Basin, which is represented by the Carme-Cabra Anticline (Fig. 2). This anticline is an ENE-WSW-trending structure that involves the Variscan basement as well as Triassic and Paleogene sediments. It has a 13\u00a0km long and nearly horizontal backlimb and a shorter 1\u00a0km long vertical to overturned forelimb (Fig. 4 and Fig. A of the Supplementary material). This uplifted area has been interpreted as the result of the emplacement of a NW-vergent basement thrust (Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust), the ramp of which constantly dips less than 30\u00b0 underneath the ensemble of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High and branches at the lower part of the Montmell Fault. Such geometry is constrained by the width of the uniformly uplifted area (~13\u00a0km) and supported by the ESCI-Catalanides deep seismic profile that shows that basement-involved thrusts in the CCR do not affect the top of the lower reflective crust located at 12 to 15\u00a0km depth (Fern\u00e0ndez et al., 1990; S\u00e0bat et al., 1997; Roca et al., 2004). In this scenario, the geometry of the frontal limb of the Carme-Cabra Anticline is interpreted as controlled by a triangular zone of distributed shear at the tip of this propagating thrust (Allmendinger, 1998; Mitra and Mount, 1998; Allmendinger et al., 2004).\nFrom a structural point of view, the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High can also be divided in two domains. In the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain, the hangingwall of the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust is practically horizontal and shows little deformation, except for the presence of sets of minor post-Paleogene SE-directed normal faults located in the Carme-Cabra Anticline backlimb, affecting the basement and generating extensional rollovers on their hangingwalls. On the other hand, the Montmell Domain shows gentle NW-vergent fault-bend folds compatible to the presence of basement reverse faults. These and their related folds involving the basement appear affected by high-angle SE-dipping extensional faults. The syncline present east of La Juncosa, for instance, appears controlled by the emplacement of one these basement-involved faults west of Masies de Sansuies (Fig. 4). This reverse fault develops a frontal structure with a discrete, relatively steep front limb and a flat crest behind it that is similar to the overall geometry observed in the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain but at minor scale.\nBoth structural domains are separated by a highly deformed and narrow strip located SE of L'Arbo\u00e7ar (labeled \u201cL'Arbo\u00e7ar deformation strip\u201d in Fig. 4). In this area, Middle Triassic and Lower Ypresian (Ilerdian) rocks belonging to the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain are strongly deformed by NW-verging recumbent folds, thrust faults and backthrusts mostly interpreted as detached at the top of the Lower Triassic (Buntsandstein). A pre-Paleogene nearly vertical extensional basement fault seems to control the location and development of the backthrusts in the NW limit of the deformation strip. Northwest and southeast of this strip, the Triassic is located at the same structural high. However, the base of the Cenozoic occupies a significantly lower position in the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain than in the Montmell Domain, where the top of the outcropping thick Mesozoic succession indicates that this would be located at least 500\u00a0m higher. This structural and stratigraphic configuration, in conjunction with the NW vergence of the structures developed along the L'Arbo\u00e7ar deformation strip, suggest interpreting the NW limit of the Montmell Domain as a nearly complete inverted SE-dipping Mesozoic extensional fault. In this scenario, the L'Arbo\u00e7ar deformation strip would correspond to the transmission of the compressional deformation to the Montmell Fault footwall, which induced the formation of detachment folds and thin-skinned thrusting facilitated by the presence of evaporitic decollement levels within the Triassic (Fig. 4).\nThe age of this suggested inversion of the Montmell Fault is poorly constrained due to the lack of preserved growth and post-growth strata around this fault. Only the presence of Paleocene to lower Ypresian strata contractionally deformed in the L'Arbo\u00e7ar deformation strip indicates that it had to take place after early Ypresian (post-Ilerdian). On the other hand, the development of the Gai\u00e0-El Camp thrust sheet is well constrained by the presence of syntectonic sediments preserved in the Sant Miquel del Montclar area (Figs. 2 and 4). At this location, the Carme-Cabra Anticline forelimb presents series of NW-dipping upper Eocene conglomerates unconformably overlying overturned lower Eocene conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones (Anad\u00f3n et al., 1985). These growth geometries allow establishing the age of the emplacement of the Gai\u00e0-El Camp thrust sheet as middle Eocene.\nThe Gai\u00e0-Montmell section also shows several extensional faults affecting the previously outlined compressional structure. A set of SE-dipping, basement-involved extensional faults bound the Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin towards the NW and show an accumulative displacement of about 2.5\u00a0km. The existence of the Mesozoic succession underneath the Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin remains uncertain due to the absence of subsurface data in this area. However, we assume its presence taking into consideration data from the Sant Sadurn\u00ed-1 well, which cuts fossil-rich limestones rocks of Early Cretaceous age (Neocomian) (Lanaja, 1987; see Fig. 1 for its location).\nIn addition, a set of minor SE-dipping faults that affect Mesozoic and Paleogene strata of the Carme-Cabra Anticline backlimb is present between the villages of Vallespinosa and Querol as well as NW of L'Arbo\u00e7ar. Cartographically, these faults are NE-SW-oriented, laterally disappearing towards the NE (Fig. 2), they display relatively high angles (>75\u00b0) and show metric to decametric fault throws. Taking into consideration roll-over geometries and the fact that they are only present in the Gai\u00e0-El Camp thrust sheet hangingwall, these are interpreted as rooted in the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust. If this fault linkage exists, this would imply the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust plane also underwent extensional reactivation during the Neogene.\n\n\n4.2\nMarmellar section\nThe Marmellar section is located at the southeast of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High and includes the southeasternmost part of the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain, the SW end of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault and the Montmell Domain (Figs. 2 and 5). At this location, the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 and the Montmell domains are separated by a NE-SW-oriented fault that laterally corresponds to what has been described in the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section as the Montmell Fault. Additionally, the section is adjacent to the Mesozoic succession-type described by Salas (1987) and labeled \u201cM\u201d in Fig. 2, which allows a detailed recognition of the Mesozoic rocks outcropping in the area.\nThe structure of the Montmell Domain belongs to an array of NE-SW-oriented, SE-dipping basement extensional faults that split the area into a system of NW-tilted fault blocks filled by up to 1100\u00a0m thick Jurassic to Barremian rocks (Fig. 5). These faults have throws of hectometric displacement up to 300\u2013400\u00a0m and kilometric lengths up to 5\u00a0km, which allows considering these extensional faults as vertically restricted (Nicol et al., 1996). At depth, these basement-involved extensional faults show domino style dipping 55\u201360\u00b0 towards the SE and display reverse and normal drag folding in their hangingwalls. Moreover, minor compressional features deforming the Mesozoic sedimentary cover are present the Montmell Domain. Basically, these are represented by SE-directed reverse faults and low angle NE-vergent thrusts respectively located at the hangingwalls and footwalls of some of the major extensional faults.\nStructural data was collected at the Riera del Marmellar outcrop in Lower Cretaceous marine limestones belonging to the Montmell Fault hangingwall. At this location, beds are 1 to 4\u00a0m-thick, trend NE-SW, dip around 31\u00b0 to the NW and contains metric-scale faults, tension veins and numerous stylolite surfaces. Gathered structural data mainly consists of normal faults with orientations ranging N30\u201370, dipping 65 to 80\u00b0 towards the NW with 80\u00b0WNW of slip, as well as reverse faults with orientations N50\u201365, dipping 70 to 80\u00b0 towards the SE with 70\u00b0E of slip. Data was displayed on stereoplots and later restored to their original geometry by rotating bedding to horizontal (Fig. 5). Once restored, all collected faults originally look as normal faults with orientations mainly ranging N15\u201375, dipping 30 to 85\u00b0 towards the NW and with slip direction towards the NW. Fluid geochemistry analysis performed by Baqu\u00e9s et al. (2012) in the same area relates these mesostructures to the Mesozoic syn-rift stage that led to the development of the Montmell-Garraf Basin.\nThe Montmell Fault, a basement-involved SE-dipping extensional fault, represents the NW boundary of the Montmell Domain. This fault is nearly vertical (>85\u00b0) at surface that progressively decreases its dip at depth up to 45\u00b0. This major structure also coincides with the NW boundary relatively thick Lower Cretaceous successions outcropping in the Montmell Domain, the map view configuration of which corresponds to series of NE-SW-oriented normal faults separated by narrow transfer zones that can be correlated with the presence of a basement fault that becomes segmented at surface (Fig. 2). Its interpreted location matches the NE prolongation of the Montmell Fault as interpreted in the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section (Fig. 4). Contractional structures such as low-angle NW-directed thrusts and their related fault-bend and fault-propagation folds are present in the Montmell Fault footwall. These structures involve Jurassic and Middle to Upper Triassic rocks and, because of they show short wavelengths in the geological map, they have been interpreted as rooted at the evaporitic levels of the uppermost Lower Triassic (Buntsandstein) that is considered a good regional detachment.\nAt surface, the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain is characterized by a Jurassic to Miocene cover deformed in a 2\u00a0km-wide gentle syncline (Pinedes Altes Syncline, Fig. 5) bounded towards the NW by a SE-dipping monocline. Miocene is only present in this syncline and unconformably overlies Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks that show a more thigh syncline geometry. The syncline appears affected by some minor extensional faults mainly developed at its lower part and includes internal onlaps in its NW limb. At smaller scale, the outcropping Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous cover appears affected by minor NW and SE-verging folds. These, locally cut by small thrusts, are interpreted as drape\/fault-bend folds developed over Muschelkalk thrust horses limited by the Keuper and the uppermost Buntsandstein evaporite decollements.\nThe NE-SW orientation of the monocline limiting the Pinedes Altes Syncline to the NW and its lateral continuity with the cartographic trace of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault towards the NE allow interpreting this structure in the Marmellar section. In map view, the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault shows splays and relay faults developed at the termination of a fault segment. Approximately 1\u00a0km NE of the Marmellar section, Jurassic rocks outcrop in both the hangingwall and the footwall of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault denoting the loss of displacement of this towards the SW (Fig. 2). Therefore, in the Marmellar section, the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault has been interpreted as a SE-dipping (~65\u00b0) basement-involved normal fault that dies out in the Upper Triassic interval and drape folds the overlying Jurassic and Miocene rocks.\nBased on these geometrical relationships, it is possible to establish the relative kinematic ages of some of the structures illustrated in the Marmellar section. The relatively thick Mesozoic succession and the structural data collected in the Riera del Marmellar outcrop (Fig. 5), indicate this fault experienced extensional motion during, at least, the Lower Cretaceous coevally to the formation of the Montmell-Garraf Basin (Salas, 1987). Compressional features along the Montmell Fault cartographic trace are essentially located in its hangingwall and affect Mesozoic rocks. This may suggest a post-Lower Cretaceous compressional phase that, at this location, did not reactivate the Montmell Fault but developed buttressing against the previously formed extensional fault (Gillcrist et al., 1987; Cooper et al., 1989). Minor reverse faults also developed in the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain, basically consisting of NW- and SE-directed thrusts at the NW and SE limbs of the Pinedes Altes Syncline and affecting Jurassic rocks (Fig. 5). Although the age of the compression is poorly constrained by preserved strata (mostly Mesozoic rocks coeval or previous to the extensional phase), it is possible to sustain that compression occurred after their deposition (post- Lower Cretaceous), and previously to the deposition of the Miocene sediments that unconformably overlie the observed contractional structures. This fact makes possible relating the compressional features observed in the Marmellar area to the regional compressional phase that affected the central part of the CCR during Paleocene to Eocene. On the other hand, onlap geometries in Miocene sediments preserved above the monocline that characterizes the NW limb of the Pinedes Altes Syncline indicate these sedimented deposited during the extensional motion of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault during Miocene times.\n\n\n\n5\nMagnetotelluric data and 2D inversion model\nNineteen magnetotelluric (MT) soundings with recording times ranging from 8 to 12\u00a0h were acquired along the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section (Fig. 2). Time series were processed using the Egbert and Booker (1986) method and applying remote reference when possible. Apparent resistivity and phase resulting curves cover periods from 0.001\u00a0s to 1\u00a0s.\nTo determine if the geoelectrical structure is 1D, 2D, 3D\/2D (2D structures with galvanic distortion) or 3D, a dimensionality analysis was performed using the WALDIM code (Mart\u00ed et al., 2009b) that is based on the invariant rotation parameters of the impedance tensor. The dimensionality results (Fig. B of the supplementary material) show that for periods shorter than 1\u00a0s, this behavior can be considered highly variable with a rather frequent 2D component, whereas at periods longer than 1\u00a0s, the geoelectrical behavior is strongly 3D. In all 2D and 2D\/3D cases, the strike is rather parallel with a trend that ranges between N015\u00b0 and N065\u00b0; orientation that is consistent with the N40\u201360\u00b0 trend of the geological structures (Figs. 1 and 3). So, the dimensionality analysis results reveal that a 2D MT model could be rather reliable to determine the geoelectrical structure in periods shorter than 1\u00a0s, but not at longer ones where the dominant 3D data structure can induce wrong interpretations (Ledo, 2005). Considering this dimensional breakdown, a directionality analysis was performed using the STRIKE code developed by McNeice and Jones (2001). It states a geoelectrical direction of N55\u00b0 although it also indicates a 3D effect of the regional structure. The elements of the impedance tensor were rotated applying this direction to obtain the two main directions for the 2D modeling: the transverse electric (TE) mode when the electric field is parallel to the strike and the transverse magnetic (TM) mode if the parallel one is the magnetic field. The obtained apparent resistivity and phase curves for each sounding are shown in the Fig. C of the Supplementary material. Data and model responses are presented as pseudo-sections built by plotting the data in an x-T map, where x-axis corresponds to the data position on the profile and T-axis to the period, which is considered as a proxy of the depth: TE and TM apparent resistivity and phase responses (Fig. D of the Supplementary material).\nThe 2D modeling is based on the simultaneous fit of the TE and TM data and has been done using the 2D RLM2DI inversion code (Rodi and Mackie, 2001) considering a 5% error floor that reaches an RMS of 2.7. The final 2D model is presented in Fig. 6A, which shows the calculated apparent resistivities.\n\n5.1\nCorrespondence between the 2D magnetotelluric model and the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section\nThe MT model illustrates the geoelectrical structure along the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section with the presence of different conductivity\/resistivity bodies (Fig. 6A). In general terms, the MT model shows a geoelectrical structure shaped by two stacked up layers. The lower layer has a very resistive (\u22651000\u00a0\u03a9\u00b7m) and homogeneous character below 0.5\u20132.5\u00a0km, although some less-resistant bands (~100\u2013600\u00a0\u03a9\u00b7m) are also present (e.g. below the Montmell Domain and the NW limit of the Miramar- Gai\u00e0 Domain). The geoelectrical behavior of the upper layer is, on the other hand, highly heterogeneous where the presence of conductive bodies with low lateral continuity (mostly isolated conductive bodies) prevails.\nThe comparison between the resistivity model and the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section (Fig. 6B) allows the correlation of the geoelectrical structure to different types of rheologies. The highly resistive and laterally continuous response of the lower geoelectrical layer (R1 and R3, Fig. 6A) can be correlated to the Variscan basement, which is made up by epimetamorphic and plutonic rocks. The high resistivity of the basement is corroborated by two additional parametric MT soundings acquired 30\u00a0km southwest of the study area in the Prades High on top of Paleozoic rocks (soundings Pz1 and Pz2, see Fig. 1 for location). MT soundings at this location reveal that Carboniferous slates and Permian granitoids show resistivities \u22651000\u00a0\u03a9\u00b7m (Fig. E in the supplementary material), fact which is also documented in other locations of the Iberian Peninsula such as the Iberian Massif (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2008), the Pyrenees (Ledo et al., 1998; Campany\u00e0 et al., 2018) and the Betic Cordillera (Mart\u00ed et al., 2009a; Rubinat et al., 2010).\nThe upper geoelectrical layer is, instead, very variable in depth and in resistivity character. From NW to SE, it includes conductive\/resistive bodies C1, C2, C3, C4, R2, C5 and C6. Comparing the geoelectrical character to geological data and interpretations along the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section (Fig. 6B), these bodies can be divided in two different groups, those that correlate with the Mesozoic and\/or Cenozoic sedimentary cover (C1, C2, R2, C5 and C6) and those that suit with positions of the Variscan basement (C3 and C4). Located in the northernmost part of the section, C1 agrees with the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary infill of the Ebro Basin, the thickness of which accounts to 1649\u00a0m of sedimentary cover above the Variscan basement as described in the Senan-1 well (Lanaja, 1987; see Figs. 1 and 3 for well location). Likewise, conductive body C2 coincides in thickness and location with the Triassic succession, which, in the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain, mainly consists of clastic sediments with evaporitic episodes and carbonates (Fig. 3). On the other hand, resistive body R2 agrees with the position of Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks, which mainly consist of massive limestones and dolostones present in the Montmell Domain. Geoelectrical body C5 also coincides with the clastic sediments with evaporitic and carbonate episodes of the Triassic of the southeastern Montmell Domain. At the southeastern end of the section, the conductive body C6 agrees with the Neogene infill of the Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin, the thickness of which is pointed out by Casas and Permanyer (1991) as approximately 2000\u00a0m of mainly terrigenous sediments (Cabrera and Calvet, 1996).\nTaking into consideration the intrinsic resistive character of the Variscan basement, the explanation about the nature of the conductive body C3 is conjectural. Low resistive values at this location (\u226410\u00a0\u03a9\u00b7m) can be related to highly fractured rocks (e.g., Pous et al., 2001; Mart\u00ed et al., 2020) and\/or metallic mineralizations (Mart\u00ed et al., 2009a) similar to those recognized in the central CCR southwest of the study area in the Prades High (Fig. 1). Examples of documented metal mineralizations in this area consist of Pb-Zn-Ba-Ag-Ni-Cu sediment-hosted veins, late Hercynian to Triassic in age, formed along intra-Paleozoic and Lower Triassic fractures (Cardellach et al., 1990; Canet et al., 2005; Alfonso et al., 2012). Hence, metal mineralizations, which include highly conductive elements, would enhance the conductive character of the Variscan basement rocks at C3 (Fig. 6).\nThe geoelectrical body C4 belongs to a 1\u20132\u00a0km wide, SE-dipping band of relatively low resistivity (\u226515\u00a0\u03a9\u00b7m) 2\u00a0km depth underneath the NW limit of the Montmell Domain (Fig. 6). This band is clearly differentiated from the surrounding high resistive and homogeneous signature that characterizes Variscan basement and appears in agreement with the location of the NW limit of the Montmell Domain. The origin of this low resistivity is uncertain, although it seems to be related to a different type or degree of deformation between the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 and the Montmell domains. While the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain formed during the Paleogene compression concentrating its deformation at the tip of the Gaia-El Camp Thrust and the frontal limb of the Cabra-Carme Anticline, the structural analysis in the Montmell Domain indicates a higher degree of deformation that includes thick-skinned extensional and contractional structures. The Variscan basement is highly deformed in the central CCR and only planar-type Paleozoic structures such as low-angle thrusts have been described (Julivert and Dur\u00e1n, 1990). However, this type of geometries does not suit with the description of C4. Considering C4 is related to the presence of a SE-dipping basement fault, its 1 to 2\u00a0km width would correspond to the damage zone located at the Montmell Fault footwall where conductivity has been enhanced by the presence of fluids within a fractured and permeable zone (e.g., Pous et al., 2001) and, perhaps, metal conductive mineralizations.\nConsidering these interpretations, the MT model has allowed constraining three key structural aspects along the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section (Fig. 6): 1) the depth of the base of the Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary infill of the Ebro Basin over the Variscan basement in the northernmost sector (conductive body C1 between MT soundings 001 and 002); 2) the geometry of the Montmell Fault underneath the northern limit of the Montmell Domain and the location at depth of its related shortcut (conductive body C4 between MT soundings 020 and 010); and 3) the base of the Mesozoic to Miocene sedimentary infill of the Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin in the southernmost sector (conductive body C6 south of the MT sounding 015).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion: tectonic evolution and structural inheritance of the central CCR\nStructural and stratigraphic observations along the Gai\u00e0-Montmell and Marmellar sections, together with regional geophysical data and geological maps allow the characterization of the deformation history of the linking zone between the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s and El Camp basins (Figs. 1 and 2). The tectonic evolution of this area includes three major Alpine events: A Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous extension, a latest Cretaceous-early Oligocene compression and uplift, and a late Oligocene-Neogene extension.\n\n6.1\nLate Jurassic (Oxfordian) \u2013 early cretaceous extension: Montmell-Garraf Basin formation\nThe Alpine cycle regionally starts with a Late Permian-Early Triassic extensional period that controlled the deposition of siliciclastic and carbonate units along NE-SW-trending basins (Gal\u00e1n-Abell\u00e1n et al., 2013; Mercedes-Mart\u00edn et al., 2014; Mercedes-Mart\u00edn and Buatois, 2020). However, in the study area Triassic strata show no lateral thickness variations indicating a relative tectonic quiescence during this period. The first hints of Mesozoic tectonic activity do not appear until the Late Jurassic. Upper Oxfordian to Valanginian carbonate-dominated sediments deposited in an incipient depocenter (the Montmell-Garraf Basin), bounded towards the NW by a high-angle SE-dipping extensional fault. The constant thickness of the Valanginian sediments indicates they were deposited over a planar extensional ramp (McClay, 1995; Withjack and Schlische, 2006; Ferrer et al., 2016). This fault would correspond to the breakaway fault of the extensional system, the present-day location of which corresponds to the SE limit of L'Arbo\u00e7ar deformation strip (Fig. 4). Laterally towards the NE, this fault corresponds to the SW prolongation of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault (Figs. 2 and 5).\nLate Valanginian to Hauterivian strata are absent in the Montmell-Garraf Basin and Barremian sediments paraconformably overlie preserved Valanginian (Fig. 5). This hiatus throughout the Neocomian is widespread recognized in the region and, with a diachronic character, has been interpreted in two ways: as a period of decelerated subsidence, emersion and relative tectonic quiescence in the external zones of the rift basin system (Anad\u00f3n et al., 1979; Salas et al., 2001), or related to a thermal post-Late Jurassic-early Valanginian rifting phase (Salas et al., 2020). From Barremian on, an acceleration of the subsidence takes place in the Montmell-Garraf Basin following two different phases: 1) Barremian to early Albian, 2) late Albian to Cenomanian. During this period, the breakaway fault shifts towards the SE to the present-day location of the Montmell Fault (Figs. 4 and 5). Considering this scenario, the Montmell Fault, can therefore be considered as the SW segment of a major structure that we call the Montmell-Vall\u00e8s Fault System.\nBarremian to Lower Albian sediments were deposited in the Montmell-Marmellar area with significant thickness variations. Up to 550\u00a0m of Barremian to Lower Aptian shallow marine carbonates deposited on the Montmell Fault hangingwall in the Marmellar area. In comparison, towards the NW in the Miramar-Gaia Domain, Paleocene sediments conformably lie over Triassic strata (Fig. 4) and Jurassic to Cretaceous sediments are absent. This fact can be explained by erosion or non-deposition. The nonexistence of clastic deposits during this period, which would represent the erosion of Jurassic and Cretaceous strata before the Paleocene, most likely indicates a hiatus scenario due to the presence of a paleo-structural high NW of the Montmell Fault (Ebro High, Fig. 7C) during, at least, the extensional motion of the Montmell Fault from Barremian to early Albian.\nThe end of the extensional motion of the Montmell Fault cannot be established with precision with the analyzed data. However, regional criteria associate the end of the extension to the development of the Middle Albian Unconformity (Fig. 3) (Salas, 1987; Salas et al., 2001; Salas et al., 2020). From this time and up to the Cenomanian, a relatively constant thickness unit characterized by the entrance of clastic sediments is deposited (Salas and Casas, 1993). This period has been traditionally interpreted as post-rift thermal relaxation with associated homogeneous subsidence (Robles, 1982; Alonso et al., 1993; Salas et al., 2001). However, new interpretations relate this period to late crustal extension over a low angle fault that passively transports the area previously formed by high-angle extensional faults (Tugend et al., 2015) and, hence, with the resulting extensional displacement of the Montmell Fault.\n\n\n6.2\nLate cretaceous - early Oligocene compression: positive inversion of the Montmell Fault and emplacement of the Gai\u00e0-El Camp thrust sheet\nFrom late Santonian (Late Cretaceous), the convergent motion between the Iberian and Eurasian plates is activated (Roest and Srivastava, 1991; Rosenbaum et al., 2002), yet the transmission of compressional stresses into the study area arises in the lattermost Cretaceous (Maastrichtian?). During this period of the convergence, up to three phases can be distinguished. The first phase takes place at the end of the Cretaceous and is recorded in the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain by the presence of a paraconformity that brings the basal Paleocene and the Keuper into contact (Figs. 3 and 4). The presence of this unconformity indicates a regional pre-Paleocene uplift that can be linked to an uppermost Cretaceous contractional deformation over the entire area or, conversely, to an isostatic adjustment of the Montmell Fault footwall after the Late Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous rifting phase. From a tectonic point of view, this period can be both contractional and quiescent. The second phase occurs from Paleocene to early Eocene times, and is characterized by the sedimentation of concordant fine-grained terrigenous beds and carbonates with little lateral thickness variations deposited in the distal areas of the Pyrenean foreland (Anad\u00f3n et al., 1979; Anad\u00f3n et al., 1985). These deposits indicate the absence of significant deformation or creation of relief in the adjacent areas of the central CCR and, therefore, a period of tectonic quiescence. The third and most relevant compressional phase in the study area takes place from Middle Eocene to early Oligocene. During this period compressional structures emerged in both Miramar-Gai\u00e0 and Montmell domains. The footwall of the Montmell Fault was strongly deformed by a set of basement shortcuts that laterally become thin-skinned-controlled fold-and-thrust systems detached at top Buntsandstein and Keuper evaporitic levels. On the other hand, minor deformation appeared in the Montmell Domain where SE-vergent backthrusts and pop-up structures developed (Figs. 4 and 5), possibly as a result of slight buttressing effect. This structural style around the Montmell Fault is also observed in several parallel minor extensional faults in the Montmell Domain (Figs. 4 and 5), which denote the contractional reactivation of pre-existent Mesozoic extensional faults in the area. The tectonic inversion is basically characterized by minor hangingwall buttressing later passively transported by shortcuts developed in the upper part of the reactivated faults, and thin-skinned thrust systems detached in the Triassic evaporite levels of the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain.\nThe whole ensemble of the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain became uniformly uplifted by the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust. Considering the dip of this thrust and the fact that it merges at depth to the Montmell Fault, the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust can be interpreted as a major footwall shortcut developed to provide a smoother fault trajectory during the inversion of the Montmell Fault (Fig. 7B).\nPaleogene growth geometries at the SE margin of the Ebro Basin consisting of Upper Eocene to lower Oligocene sediments unconformably deposited over Lower to Middle Eocene strata (St. Miquel del Montclar area, Figs. 4 and 7B) allow establishing the precise age of the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust emplacement as late Bartonian to Lower Oligocene. Conversely, the age of the inversion of the Montmell-Garraf Basin cannot be fully constrained due to the lack of preservation of growth sequences. Nevertheless, taking into consideration that up to Lower Ypresian (Ilerdian) sediments are involved in the Montmell Fault footwall deformation with no growth geometries, it can be stated that the contractional motion in this area is, at least, late Ypresian (Cuisian). Additionally, the fact that the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust has been interpreted as a major shortcut supports the idea that the primary reactivation of the Montmell Fault was to some extent older (late Ypresian to Lutetian).\n\n\n6.3\nLatest Oligocene(?)\/early Miocene - late Miocene extension: Baix Pened\u00e8s Basin formation and partial reactivation of the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust\nThe Paleogene structure described in the previous section is affected by extensional deformation that cuts or, at times, reactivates previously formed faults. Most of the interpreted extensional faults have a predominant ENE-WSW orientation, dip towards the SE and generally display decametric to hectometric displacements (Figs. 2 and 7A). Four major faults (Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s, Montmell, El Camp and Baix Pened\u00e8s faults) show kilometric fault traces and display an overlapped arrangement linked by large NW-SE-oriented accommodation zones (Fig. 8\n).\nThe Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault progressively loses its displacement towards the SW overstepping with the Montmell and the Baix Pened\u00e8s faults in the respectively Marmellar and Sant Mart\u00ed Sarroca transfer zones (Fig. 8). In this area, the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault throw becomes less than 300\u2013400\u00a0m, displaying a drape-fold detached in the Upper Triassic evaporites on its hangingwall (Fig. 5). Extensional displacement is, hence, relayed to the Montmell and the Baix Pened\u00e8s faults, which extends towards the SW with a similar orientation. The Montmell Fault shows decametric fault throws and a low accumulated extensional displacement. The Baix Pened\u00e8s Fault, in turn, shows a segmented fault pattern with several SE-dipping splays at surface and a considerably higher accumulated throw reaching several hundreds of meters. NW-SE-trending breaching faults are present in the Sant Mart\u00ed Sarroca Transfer Zone (Fig. 8). The Baix Pened\u00e8s Fault is interpreted as rooted at the deep NW-vergent basement ramp underneath the area (Fig. 7).\nOn the other hand, the displacement of the El Camp Fault drastically decreases towards the NE and becomes a narrow array of SE-dipping faults with hectometric accumulated displacements at the Carme-Cabra Anticline backlimb (Figs. 2 and 8). Considering the geometry of the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain as the result of the displacement and uplift over a low angle basement ramp shallowing towards the NW (Fig. 7B), this array of extensional faults at the NE end of El Camp Fault has been interpreted as rooted in the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust (Figs. 4 and 7A).\nIn this context of overlapped major extensional faults, the NW-SE-trending faults present in the Sant Mart\u00ed Sarroca Transfer Zone as well as the Pont d'Armentera Fault (Fig. 8) are considered as relay ramp-breaching faults of a soft linked extensional system (Fossen and Rotevatn, 2016). These zones would transfer displacement between the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s and the Baix Pened\u00e8s faults and between El Camp Fault and the Montmell-Vall\u00e8s Fault System respectively.\nThe extensional reactivation (or negative inversion) of preexisting faults is suggested by several evidences such as: 1) the development of an array of extensional faults rooted at the discrete fault plane of the Paleogene Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust at the NE end of El Camp Fault; 2) the extensional geometry of the Montmell Fault (although this fault has a reverse movement during Paleogene times); or 3) the Baix Pened\u00e8s Fault and its splays which are also rooted at a Paleogene reverse fault footwall ramp. However, the reactivation of the Montmell Fault is relatively limited, and the extension seems basically relayed to the Baix Pened\u00e8s Fault, which induced the development of a 1.5\u00a0km deep basin on its hangingwall (Fig. 7A).\nAll these structural observations indicate a post-early Oligocene extensional period that resulted in the extensional reactivation of the previously formed Paleogene and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous faults, the age of which can be constrained based on the tectonostratigraphic relationships. Undeformed Pleistocene alluvial deposits fossilize most of the major faults in the central CCR, hence, indicating their extensional motion is pre-Pleistocene. Additionally, major faults, which often show drape-folds on their hangingwalls, cut or fold Serravallian sediments. Therefore, their extensional motion must be considered as post-Serravallian. Yet, extensional growth strata geometries are indeed observed in upper Serravallian-lower Tortonian sediments deposited over the hangingwall of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault in the Marmellar area (Fig. 5), which would indicate, at least for this fault, extensional motion during this period. This fact agrees to previous regional studies that indicate extension in the CCR occurred between Burdigalian and Messinian times (Gallart, 1981; Cabrera et al., 1991; Cabrera and Calvet, 1996; Porta and Civ\u00eds, 1996; Cabrera et al., 2004). The lack of upper Oligocene and Neogene sediments preserved over in the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 and Montmell domains prevent establishing a relative chronology of the observed extensional faults.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nA new field-based dataset integrated with MT data acquired across the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High has allowed the recognition of the main features characterizing the upper crustal Alpine structure. MT data along the Gai\u00e0-Montmell section has allowed a better definition of the structure at depth and the identification of zones with potential fractures and conductive fluids.\nThe structure of the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High consists of two domains with a differentiated tectono-stratigraphic evolution: the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 and the Montmell domains. The Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain belongs to an area with a very thin Mesozoic succession (only Triassic) uplifted over the Ebro Basin by a NW-vergent low-angle basement thrust (the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust). The Montmell Domain belongs to an area with a well-developed Mesozoic succession that includes Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. This domain is limited towards the NW by the Montmell Fault and its structure consists of NW-vergent compressional faults affected by high-angle SE-dipping extensional basement faults. A highly deformed area with prominent NW-vergent thrust imbrications characterizes the limit between the two domains.\nThe Montmell Fault corresponds to the SW prolongation of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault. Both faults are partially overlapped and linked by the Marmellar Accommodation Zone. We call this major structure the Montmell-Vall\u00e8s Fault System. This constituted the NW limit of the Montmell-Garraf extensional basin, which developed during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (Oxfordian to middle Aptian).\nA period of tectonic inversion and contractional reactivation related to the Paleogene compressional phase is attested by the presence of highly deformed areas (thin-skinned thrusting and footwall shortcut development) along the Montmell-Vall\u00e8s Fault System footwall. These contractional structures belong to the positive inversion of the Mesozoic Montmell-Garraf Basin and the emplacement of a NW-directed basement thrust (Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust) that uplifted the Montmell-Garraf Basin and the adjoining marginal areas of the Ebro High. Reactivation of the Montmell Fault appears to be by some means restricted and, hence, deformation propagated to the fault footwall resulting in shortcut formation. The areas where footwall shortcut structures formed are characterized by conductive bodies at depth.\nThe age of the positive inversion can be relatively well established by syn-kinematic sediments preserved in the SE margin of the Ebro Basin. These indicate that the Gai\u00e0-El Camp Thrust emplacement is late Bartonian to lower Oligocene. The absolute age of the Montmell-Vall\u00e8s Fault reactivation is uncertain. However, taking into consideration preserved pre-kinematic strata in its footwall, it can be established as, at least, late Ypresian (Cuisian).\nNegative tectonic inversion of the previously formed Paleogene and Late-Jurassic faults is also within reach in the Gai\u00e0-Montmell High. During Latest Oligocene(?)\/early Miocene - late Miocene extensional displacement at the SW-end of the Vall\u00e8s-Pened\u00e8s Fault is relayed to the Baix Pened\u00e8s Fault and, at minor scale, to the Montmell Fault. Accordingly, accommodation zones characterized by the presence of relay ramp-breaching faults developed. The negative inversion of the Gai\u00e0-El amp Thrust is also identified at the NE-end of El Camp Fault, where an array of extensional faults developed in the Miramar-Gai\u00e0 Domain. Tectonostratigraphic relationships indicate that extension occurred between Burdigalian and Messinian times.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\n","200":"","201":"","202":"","203":"","204":"","205":"","206":"","207":"","208":"","209":"","210":"","211":"","212":"","213":"","214":"","215":"","216":"","217":"","218":"","219":"","220":"","221":"","222":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nGeological modeling commonly integrates a wide range of geoscientific data (e.g., field observations, geophysics, geochemistry, geochronology). In recent years, secondary or derivative products such as fault density and heat flow models enhance characterization of various components in crustal architecture (e.g., Holden et al., 2012; Hronsky, 2020) using increasingly data-rich and complex geoscientific databases. These new products act as effective constraints that provide additional confidence and a means of further refining qualitative interpretations. Herein, a new derivative parameter, \u2018structural complexity\u2019, from variance of bedding measurements and aeromagnetic lineaments, is calculated to support geological interpretation of shear-zones, faults, and folds in the western Wabigoon and southern Abitibi subprovinces of the Canadian Shield. Structural complexity here refers to an increased variance of planar feature orientations, such as bedding, in response to deformation events.\nIn addition to improving geological interpretations, structural complexity mapping may also be applied to exploration for economic mineral deposits. Frequently, mineral prospectivity studies use proximity or density calculations of favorable features (e.g., fault traces, fold axes, favorable lithological units) to represent structurally complex zones as a proxy for both fluid pathways and traps, which are likely to be genetically related to ore formation (Knox-Robinson and Wyborn, 1997; Carranza and Hale, 2001; Bierlein et al., 2006; Kreuzer et al., 2015; Zhang and Zhou, 2015; Campos et al., 2017; Ford, 2019). Within orogenic and other mineralizing systems, fluid pathways act as the plumbing system that carries mineralized fluids through the crust to structural and\/or chemical traps where fluids are concentrated and metals are precipitated. The preparation of derivative products that highlight structural traps, such as antiform fold hinges and brittle faults, are often used as inputs in such prospectivity analysis; however, they frequently oversimplify and heavily bias geological features. Efforts to diminish human-related biases and increase repeatability are being developed to make prospectivity analysis more rigorous and robust (An et al., 2001; Ford and McCuaig, 2010; Kreuzer et al., 2015; Lindsay et al., 2016; Yousefi and Carranza, 2016; Yousefi and Nyk\u00e4nen, 2016; Almasi et al., 2017a, 2017b; Burkin et al., 2019; Hronsky and Kreuzer, 2019; Schaeben et al., 2019). Automated techniques of mapping structural complexity may provide a valuable addition to these efforts.\nStatistical mapping of structural complexity is applied to two Archean greenstone belts in the western Wabigoon subprovince near Dryden, Ontario, Canada and southern Abitibi subprovince near Timmins, Ontario Canada. These study sites include representative areas of juvenile volcanic crust that record similar deformational histories but contrasting known base and precious metal resources, while having sufficient geological and geophysical data to support statistical analyses.\nCompiled structural measurements, geological interpretations, new regional geological maps for each area of interest, and mineral deposit information are provided in a joint data-in-brief publication (Montsion et al., 2021).\n\n1.1\nRegional geology\nThe Superior Province is the largest preserved Archean craton and consists of Eo- to Neoarchean granite-greenstone, gneissic, and metasedimentary domains that amalgamated as a series of generally east-trending belts between ~2720 and\u00a0~\u00a02660\u00a0Ma (Percival et al., 2012; Frieman et al., 2017). Both selected regions (Fig. 1\n) have a similar geologic history in terms of geodynamic setting, volcanism, deformation, and metamorphism (Beakhouse et al., 2011; Zammit, 2020). Since all rock units in both areas are, with the exception of Proterozoic diabase dikes, metamorphosed to greenschist to amphibolite facies, the term \u2018meta\u2019 will not be used in lithologic descriptions.\n\n1.1.1\nDryden study area in the western Wabigoon subprovince\nThe western Wabigoon subprovince (geological map in Montsion et al., 2021) is primarily composed of juvenile Neoarchean volcanic successions that are bounded by the Paleo- to Neoarchean Winnipeg River and Marmion gneissic-plutonic terranes to the north and south, respectively (Percival and Helmstaedt, 2004; Tomlinson et al., 2004). The Dryden study area (Fig. 1; geological map in Montsion et al., 2021) hosts felsic, intermediate, and mafic volcanic formations (ca. 2750\u20132715\u00a0Ma, Davis et al., 1989; Davis et al., 2005), marine turbiditic sequences (ca. 2715\u20132710\u00a0Ma; Davis et al., 2005), and fluvial-alluvial clastic sedimentary units (ca. 2703\u20132696\u00a0Ma; Beakhouse et al., 1995; Dostal et al., 2004; Corcoran and Mueller, 2007).\nThe volcanic and sedimentary packages were intruded by tonalitic to granodioritic syn-volcanic batholiths (ca. 2750\u20132680\u00a0Ma; Blackburn et al., 1981; Davis et al., 2005; Duguet and Beakhouse, 2012), such as the Revell batholith, Atikwa-Lawrence batholith, and Basket Lake batholith (Montsion et al., 2021). Smaller dioritic, granitic and syenitic porphyritic intrusions such as the Lost Lake porphyry, Thundercloud porphyry, and Taylor Lake stock (geological map in Montsion et al., 2021) intruded during syn-volcanic to post-deformation phases (ca. 2705\u20132695\u00a0Ma). Finally, two generations of Proterozoic diabase dikes crosscut the western Wabigoon subprovince. These are northwest-trending dikes (ca. 1887\u20131889\u00a0Ma; Davis and Hamilton, 2010) and north-trending dikes (~1137\u00a0Ma; Heaman and Easton, 2006; Stone et al., 2010).\nCollisional deformation began in the Neoarchean (~2700\u00a0Ma) with north-south shortening that resulted in kilometer-scale isoclinal to outcrop-scale parasitic folds with an associated axial planar foliation that is mainly marked by chlorite in volcanic units and micas in sedimentary units (Kresz et al., 1982a, 1982b; Montsion et al., 2019; Zammit, 2020). Progressive shortening resulted in the localization of strain into several east-trending deformation zones, including the Wabigoon and Mosher Bay-Washeibemaga deformation zones (Montsion et al., 2021; Blackburn, 1978; Zammit, 2020), which underwent north-over-south movement (Zammit, 2020) associated with the unconformable deposition of coarse-grained sediments in the Stormy and Manitou basins (Kresz et al., 1982a, 1982b; Corcoran and Mueller, 2007; Montsion et al., 2021). A later stage of northwest-southeast shortening, coeval with most orogenic gold mineralization in the area (Melling et al., 1988; Zammit, 2020), refolded the earlier isoclinal folds (i.e., locally increasing structural complexity), and has been interpreted as recording sinistral transpressive strain along the northeast-trending Manitou-Dinorwic deformation zone (geological map in Montsion et al., 2021; Parker, 1989; Zammit, 2020).\nAlthough the western Wabigoon subprovince is apparently much less endowed with base and precious metal resources compared to the Abitibi subprovince, it nevertheless hosts several deposits and developed prospects with a variety of metal resources (gold, silver, copper, zinc, iron, lithium, molybdenum, uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements; Parker, 1989). Gold systems include Goliath (1.2 Moz Au), Goldlund (0.8 Moz Au), Gold Rock (0.15 Moz) and Van Horne (0.002 Moz, past production plus measured and indicated resources, Ontario Geological Survey, 2019).\n\n\n1.1.2\nThe Timmins study area in the southern Abitibi subprovince\nThe Timmins study area (Fig. 1; geological map in Montsion et al., 2021) is comprised of ultramafic to felsic volcanic assemblages that are unconformably overlain by two sedimentary successions. Thick glacial cover and overburden limits outcrop exposure; however extensive drilling has sufficiently constrained geological interpretations within the Timmins region. Volcanic successions range in age from ~2750 to ~2695\u00a0Ma and include disconformities that are locally marked by iron formation and cherts (Thurston and Chivers, 1990; Thurston et al., 2008; Frieman et al., 2017). The Porcupine sedimentary assemblage (ca. 2690\u20132685\u00a0Ma, Frieman et al., 2017) is comprised of fine to medium grained beds with rare conglomeratic lenses, iron formations, and mafic to felsic volcanic flows. The Timiskaming coarse- to medium-grained sedimentary assemblage (ca. 2679\u20132669\u00a0Ma; Frieman et al., 2017) is primarily preserved as narrow (<2\u00a0km) panels to the north of the Porcupine-Destor deformation zone (PDDZ; Ayer et al., 2005; Bateman, 2005; Bleeker, 2015; Montsion et al., 2021). A comprehensive geological overview is provided in Ayer et al. (2002, 2005), Bateman (2005), Bleeker (2015), Monecke et al. (2017) and references therein.\nThe volcanic and sedimentary packages were intruded by ultramafic to felsic bodies that have been classified based on composition and relative timing (i.e., syn-volcanic and syn-deformation). Syn-volcanic intrusions are large, batholitic complexes that display gabbroic to granodioritic compositions, similar to their volcanic counterparts, and are generally found west of the Mattagami River fault (Corfu, 1993; Mortensen, 1993a, 1993b; Ayer et al., 2005; Montsion et al., 2021). Syn-deformational intrusions, which dominate the majority of the map area, cross-cut sedimentary and volcanic assemblages, are variably deformed depending on proximity to deformation zones, and are tonalitic to \u201cpotassic\u201d (i.e., granite, monzonite, and syenite) in composition (Ayer et al., 2002). Late intrusive intermediate to felsic porphyritic clusters as well as several diabase dike swarms intrude supracrustal units. The latter include the north-northwest trending Matachewan dikes (ca. 2445\u20132490\u00a0Ma; Ernst and Buchan, 2010), northwest-trending Sudbury dikes (~1235\u00a0Ma; Ernst and Buchan, 2010), and northeast-trending Abitibi dikes (~1140\u00a0Ma; Ernst and Buchan, 2010).\nThe structural history of the Timmins camp is well documented (Ayer et al., 2002, 2005; Bateman et al., 2008; Bleeker, 2015; Monecke et al., 2017), with two main shortening events. A first north-south shortening event resulted in kilometer-scale isoclinal folds in the volcanic and Porcupine sedimentary assemblages, associated with an axial planar foliation mainly marked by chlorite in volcanic units and micas in sedimentary units. Generally east-trending brittle-ductile deformation zones such as the crustal-scale PDDZ (Fig. 2C; Ayer et al., 2005; Bateman et al., 2008, Montsion et al., 2021) locally controlled the unconformable deposition of the Timiskaming sediments (Bateman et al., 2008; Bleeker, 2015). A second northwest-southeast shortening event resulted in the refolding of the isoclinal folds, formation of asymmetric z-folds, and the development of a crenulation cleavage axial planar to z-folds. This event is coeval with the formation of world-class orogenic gold deposits along the PDDZ (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2007). Late Neoarchean or Proterozoic north-northwest trending faults, such as the Mattagami River, Burrows Benedict and Buskegau River faults (geological map in Montsion et al., 2021), offset older structural features.\nThe Timmins mining camp hosts several world-class mineral systems, including the Kidd-Creek Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS; 9.6 Mt. Zn, 3.7 Mt. Cu), Dome (27.1 Moz Au), Hollinger (20.5 Moz Au), McIntyre (10.8 Moz Au) and 10+ smaller orogenic deposits (>1 Moz Au). Total endowment represents over 2700\u00a0t of gold, 10 Mt. of zinc, 4 Mt. of copper, and 60,000\u00a0t of nickel (measured and indicated, Ontario Geological Survey, 2019).\n\n\n\n\n2\nData\n\n2.1\nStructural measurements\nIn Dryden, structural measurements (e.g., bedding, younging, lineations, and foliations) were digitized from 64 geological maps (complete list in Montsion et al., 2021publication). These were integrated with one digital compilation database (Beakhouse et al., 2011) and new field observations from 2018 and 2019 fieldwork. Combined, the database is composed of roughly 28,000 data points. Fig. 2A presents a subset of the data overlain on mapped geology. A rose diagram of bedding in this area shows that bedding is generally oriented northeast-southwest and the calculated axial plane of the Upper Manitou anticline has a strike of 050\u00b0 and dip of 85\u00b0. The axial plan was calculated using pi-analysis (e.g., Ragan, 2009).\nIn Timmins, several digital databases consisting of drill logs, structural measurements, and multi-scale geological interpretations (Ayer and Chartrand, 2011; Bateman, 2005; Berger, 2010; Hathway, 2005; Houl\u00e9 and Hall, 2007; MIRA, 2005), along with digitized points from 33 scanned maps (complete list in Montsion et al., 2021), were compiled and integrated to generate a comprehensive structural measurement database with roughly 8000 measurements. The number of Timmins measurements is restricted by thick glacial overburden and limited outcrop exposure. Most of the compiled measurements are concentrated around the city of Timmins and other, smaller mineralized properties. Frequently, data points are clustered around outcrops and appear superimposed in regional-scale maps. Fig. 2C presents representative compiled structures as well as a rose diagram of bedding for the Timmins camp. Bedding in this area trends east-northeast and the axial plane of the most dominant fold is 260\/88; however, several progressive deformations events, strain from the nearby PDDZ, and intrusions have resulted in complex fold interference patterns.\n\n\n2.2\nGeophysical\nThe Dryden aeromagnetic data were acquired between November Middleton, 2000 and February 2001, with 200\u00a0m line spacing, 1500\u00a0m tie lines spacing, and a flight elevation of 70\u00a0m (Ontario Geological Survey, 2011). The Timmins aeromagnetic data were acquired between 1975 and 1992, with 200\u00a0m line spacing, 1000\u00a0m tie lines spacing, and a flight elevation of 70\u00a0m (Ontario Geological Survey, 2003). Both data sets were reprocessed as part of this study. Total magnetic intensity (TMI) data were gridded at 40\u00a0m resolution in both areas, using the minimum curvature algorithm in Geosoft Ltd. Oasis Montaj\u2122. Reduction to the pole (RTP) was based on the IGRF (International Geomagnetic Reference Field), calculated at the date of the survey (Dryden: declination \u22120.9\u00b0, inclination 75.2\u00b0; Timmins: declination \u221211.2\u00b0, inclination 74.8\u00b0). First and second vertical derivatives, tilt (see Fig. 3A and 4A\n; Miller and Singh, 1994; Thurston and Smith, 1997; Verduzco et al., 2004), and Phase Preserving Dynamic Range Compression (see Fig. 3B and 4B; Kovesi, 2012; Holden et al., 2013) were calculated from the RTP. Each technique increases contrast between anomalies and\/or act as bandpass filters, thereby highlighting trends in anomalies.\n\n\n2.3\nGeological interpretations\nNew bedrock geology maps were interpreted by overlaying and cross-referencing structural databases, outcrop lithology observations, geochronological analyses, mineral occurrence points, and previous structural interpretations on reprocessed aeromagnetic grids (Montsion et al., 2021). Interpretations were validated and enhanced by targeted field mapping in 2018\u201320. This process of integrating geological and geophysical layers is common for regional-scale geological mapping (Gunn et al., 1997; Aitken and Betts, 2009; Metelka et al., 2011; Perrouty et al., 2012; Isles and Rankin, 2013; Blundell et al., 2019).\nFor the aeromagnetic grids, spatially continuous, roughly linear anomalies were assumed to represent variably magnetic volcanic (or sedimentary) layering. This assumption is supported by field observations of similarly oriented bedding measurements in such units (Fig. 3C, D, 4C, D).\nMagnetic susceptibility of all rock units within the map areas were measured at field stations in 2018\u201319 as part of this study, using a handheld KT-10\u00a0m, or compiled from an open-source geophysical database (Biswas, 2019). These data (Fig. 5\n) were used to support aeromagnetic interpretation and as a diagnostic tool during field mapping. Volcanic units display a right skewed distribution in magnetic susceptibility with modes increasing from 0.01 SI (felsic) to 0.5 SI (ultramafic). The mode of each volcanic composition is unique and can be used to distinguish one population from the other. Intrusions, however, appear more chaotic, multi-modal distributions. Additionally, diabase dikes in Timmins closely resemble ultramafic intrusions from that area with a weakly left skewed distribution, a mode of 40 SI, and similar range in magnetic susceptibility. The presence of magnetic remanence (not measured here) may also control the airborne response of diabase dikes, but it does not affect their linear character. For other geological units, the magnetic remanence is commonly assumed to be negligible (Enkin et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\nThe proposed workflow for mapping structural complexity was performed using two inputs, field bedding measurements and auto-detected aeromagnetic lineaments. Techniques relating to pre-processing and lineament extraction from aeromagnetic grids as well as methods of calculating complexity are described below and illustrated in Fig. 6\n. Parameter sensitivity testing was also performed as part of the workflow to determine optimal parameters and the effect each has on results.\n\n3.1\nGeophysical grids\n\n3.1.1\nPre-processing for lineament extraction\nFiltering methods such as vertical and tilt derivatives are commonly used to outline high amplitude.\nanomalies, which are often interpreted as intrusive contacts or magnetite-rich stratigraphic layers. Despite their prevalence in traditional geophysical studies, these methods provide poor constraints in regions where contrast in physical properties, such as magnetic susceptibility, between adjacent lithological units is low. Signals can be masked by nearby strongly magnetic units (e.g., Fe-rich units like magnetite-bearing dikes or banded iron formations) or are attenuated by overburden (e.g., Vall\u00e9e et al., 2019). These methods consider the full range in magnetic intensity across the map area causing sometimes irrelevant and anomalous outliers to dominate outputs while suppressing detection and characterization of relevant anomalies.\nTo mitigate these effects and to highlight local magnetic trends, a high pass filtering technique termed Phase Preserving Dynamic Range Compression (PPDRC) from the CET Grid Analysis tool in Oasis Montaj\u2122 was applied (PPDRC; Kovesi, 2012; Seequent, 2019). This processing diminishes the effect of spatially distant anomalous values while amplifying subtle local trends, thus refining lineament extraction results. The PPDRC method applies monogenic filters to separate local phase and amplitude statistics within the moving windows. The grid is reconstructed while the filter preserves phase values and applies a range of reducing functions to amplitude values (Wong et al., 2006; Kovesi, 2012; Holden et al., 2013). The most significant parameter to note for this tool is the high pass cut-off wavelength. This cut-off is used to control the scale of interest such that spatial frequencies in the grid with wavelengths greater than indicated will be suppressed so residual features can be captured more effectively (Wong et al., 2006).\n\n\n3.1.2\nLineament extraction\nLinear continuity in magnetic anomalies was captured as vectorized polylines using the Line Extract tool from the Focus image analysis package provided by PCI Geomatics (2018, 2019). Extracted lineaments are defined by contrasts between spatially continuous magnetic anomalies using a suite of parameters, described below and reported in Table 1\n. Lineament extraction is a two-stage process: 1) edge detection and 2) thresholding.\n\n\n3.1.3\nEdge detection\nThe Canny approach produces an edge strength image of the hill shaded, gray-scale PPDRC grid (Canny, 1986; Liang et al., 2011) and involves filtering with a Gaussian function whose radius is defined by the \u2018Radius of Filter\u2019 parameter. Hill shading was used to increase contrast between minimum and maximum anomalies. Several sun directions and angles for the hill shades were tested, which all yielded similar results. A gradient within the radius of filter window is computed and any pixels whose gradient is not the local maximum are suppressed (i.e., edge strength set to 0 or \u2018OFF\u2019). This lineament extraction technique generates a binary image where each remaining grid cell (i.e., edge strength\u00a0=\u00a01 or \u2018ON\u2019) represents an edge element.\n\n\n3.1.4\nThresholding\nAs part of the Focus lineament detection routine, a thinning algorithm is applied to binary grids, producing pixel-wide traces that undergo testing against control parameters such as curve length, fitting error and angular distance. Traces with a minimum defined extent are extracted when the number of pixels satisfies the user-defined \u201cMinimum for curve length\u201d parameter. These traces are vectorized by fitting line segments as an approximation of the original pixel trace, where the maximum fitting error is defined by the \u201cMaximum line fitting error\u201d parameter. If the distance between pixels and the main trace exceeds this error, they will not be used to constrain the vectorized line. The resulting lines are linked and further filtered according to the \u201cMaximum angular difference\u201d, which controls the maximum angle between two linked segments, and \u201cMaximum linking distance\u201d, which controls the distance allowed between two segments (Salui, 2018).\nWhile testing this extraction method, various combinations (>100) and ranges in each parameter were applied. Based on a qualitative analysis of the different scenarios, three grids from each area were selected for further analysis (Fig. 7\n; Table 1). Of these, scenario 2 (Fig. 7C) for Dryden and scenario 3 (Fig. 7D) for Timmins were used in subsequent stages of the workflow as they balance resolution as well as sensitivity to mapped geological units.\n\n\n3.1.5\nPost-processing\nExtracted lineaments, in the form of vectorized polylines, were resampled and segmented in 200\u00a0m intervals using ESRI's ArcMap\u2122 software. The average trend of each segment was then measured and used as input for later variance calculations.\nAs an additional step in post-processing, segments within 300\u00a0m of intrusive rocks were removed from the dataset (e.g., segments encompassed by the 300\u00a0m buffer zones in Fig. 7) as the primary focus for this study is to map variance related to deformation in volcanic and sedimentary packages rather than local structural or metamorphic effects of intrusions. Only the orientation of segments that met such filtering criteria were used in the variance calculation.\n\n\n\n3.2\nMapping structural complexity\nTo map structural complexity, circular variance (in 2D) and spherical dispersion (in 3D) of primary layering in volcanic and sedimentary stratigraphy was calculated. The trend of lineament segments and the strike of bedding measurements were inputs for circular variance while strike and dip from bedding measurements were inputs for spherical dispersion. The following sections describe how each calculation method was applied to both input datasets. For outcrop bedding measurements, both variance and dispersion were performed as >90% of the compiled datasets record both the strike and dip, permitting the calculation of the dispersion of the down dip vector. For magnetic lineaments, only strike was measured, and thus, only variance was calculated.\n\n3.2.1\nVariance\nCircular variance (Davis, 2002) was calculated for neighborhoods around each point in the database using Fisher statistics (Fisher, 1959; Fisher et al., 1987). Neighborhoods are defined as circular regions within a fixed radius centered on each data point. Calculations determined variance for each neighborhood using radii from 250 to 70,000\u00a0m and a minimum population of n\u00a0>\u00a03.Variance (V) is the average square deviation of all strike observations in radians (\u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83\u2026. \u03b8\ni\n) from the population mean (\u03bc) and is represented by Eq. 1, where n equals the number of points in the neighborhood.\n\n(1)\n\nV\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\ncos\n\n\n2\n\u2217\nmod\n\n\n\u03b8\ni\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\nsin\n\n\n2\n\u2217\nmod\n\n\n\u03b8\ni\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this study, low variance (V \u2248 0) represents regions where bedding orientation is sub-parallel. Variance increases as bedding or lineament strikes display a large relative difference to one another, such as around fold hinges or across fault offsets (V \u2248 1).\nVariance was calculated for each point in the dataset and the resulting values were individually assigned to those points. To create a map of complexity, variance was interpolated among the datapoints using the minimum curvature method, a 250\u00a0m grid cell size, and 1000\u00a0m blanking distance in Oasis Montaj\u2122 (Fig. 8A and C).\n\n\n3.2.2\nDispersion\nDispersion calculations (Davis, 2002; Middleton, 2000) were performed using Fisher statistics (Fisher, 1959; Fisher et al., 1987) to test how significantly a second orientation component (i.e., dip) may affect the quantification of structural complexity. Dispersion was calculated in two stages. First, the strike (S) measurements were converted to dip direction (i.e., azimuth: A\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0\u03c0\/2). Second, the down-dip vector that lies within the bedding plane was quantified using the orientation of the vector is defined by its north (x), south (y), and vertical (z) coordinates with the length of the vector defined by its vertex. These variables are expressed using Eqs. 2, 3, and 4, where D is dip of bedding and A is dip direction.\n\n(2)\n\nx\n=\ncos\nD\ncos\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\ny\n=\ncos\nD\nsin\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\nz\n=\nsin\nD\n\n\n\n\nOnly bedding measurements with a recorded strike and dip were used to calculate spherical dispersion. As with variance, a range of neighborhood radii from 250\u00a0m to 70,000\u00a0m and a minimum population of n\u00a0>\u00a03 were used. From each neighborhood population, the spherical mean direction is defined by the length of the resultant vector (R) using Eq. 5. The dispersion (k) relative to nearest neighbour R vectors can then be compared using Eq. 6.\n\n(5)\n\nR\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\nxi\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\n\u2211\nyi\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\n\u2211\nzi\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\u03ba\n=\n\n\n\nn\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n\n\nn\n\u2212\nR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to circular variance, spherical dispersion was calculated for each point in the dataset and the resulting values were individually assigned to those points. Dispersion values were interpolated using the minimum curvature method with a 250\u00a0m grid cell size and 1000\u00a0m blanking distance in Oasis Montaj\u2122 (Fig. 8B).\n\n\n\n3.3\nValidation using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nThe two-sampled Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test in Python (Kolmogorov, 1933; Smirnov, 1948; Davis, 2002) was used to verify that results reflect real phenomenon rather than a random distribution of values. This was done by quantifying the similarity between results and a randomly generated, normally distributed synthetic population of the same size and range. For results from each permutation of input parameters, the maximum difference (\u0394) between the cumulative distribution function of the result and a randomly generated dataset were compared. According to the null hypothesis, if \u0394 is greater than the critical value (\u0394 \u03b1), the null hypothesis can be rejected meaning the variance or dispersion result does not resemble a random distribution. With this logic, the null hypothesis was rejected for all results using the 0.01% critical value, indicating a very small probability (0.01%) that variance and dispersion observed was random (See Table 2\n). A rejected hypothesis means all datasets passed the KS test in Table 2. The critical value (\u03b1) was calculated using Eq. 7 (Knuth, 1997) where \u03b1 denotes the confidence level, c(\u03b1) is the corresponding coefficient for \u03b1, and n1 and n2 represent the population size of the calculated and random populations, respectively.\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03b1\n=\nc\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n1\n\n+\n\nn\n2\n\n\n\n\nn\n1\n\n\nn\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\nParameter sensitivity testing\nWhen performing variance and dispersion calculations on both bedding measurements and magnetic lineament trends, several parameters were tested to determine which were most appropriate given available data and geological constraints. These include varying the neighborhood radius (Supplementary Material Fig. B), segment length of lineaments (Supplementary Material Fig. C), high pass wavelengths from the PPDRC filtering technique (Supplementary Material Fig. D), input grid resolution (Supplementary Material Fig. E), minimum number of points required in a neighborhood, and minimum number of points with respect to data density (Fig. 9\n). The values tested and optimal results for each parameter are listed in Table 3\n.\n\n3.4.1\nNeighborhood radii\nNeighborhood radii for variance and dispersion calculations from 250\u00a0m to 70,000\u00a0m were tested. A density cross-plot and summary statistics from 250\u00a0m to 10,000\u00a0m radii results are plotted against variance in Fig. 9 to determine the optimal neighborhood radius. From 10,000\u00a0m to 70,000\u00a0m radii, changes are negligible. Summary statistics such as quartiles (triangles), mean (circles), and standard deviations (squares) for lineament results are plotted in Fig. 10\n to highlight data trends and illustrate how the optimal radius value was determined. The distribution of these variables follows an exponential function. This likely reflects variance in small neighborhood radii which is commonly low since included datapoints are spatially and structurally related. As distance increases, data points from adjacent structures and, perhaps, different structural domains were included in the variance calculation. However, at some point, values converge along a sill since strike cannot exceed 360\u00b0 (and dip cannot exceed 90\u00b0). Due to the heterogeneous spatial distribution of field measurements, in some cases, it was challenging to graphically determine which was the optimal neighborhood radius for bedding measurement results. Instead, the optimal search radius was visually determined based on a balance between resolution, spatial association with interpreted geological structures, and noise (see Supplementary Material Fig. A). For lineament variance results where data was homogenously distributed, an optimum of 1750\u00a0m was identified. This optimal distance was selected as the infection point between the rise and sill of summary statistics in Fig. 10 (i.e., where data trends flatten). The sill represents the point where increasing the radius no longer statistically changes the data distribution, it will simply smooth results. Since the inflection points between the rise and sill are not exactly the same for all trendlines, a range of neighborhood radii (1250\u20132000\u00a0m) could be considered optimal and the median value (1750\u00a0m) was used for further calculations.\n\n\n3.4.2\nSegment lengths\nIncreasing the segment lengths of lineaments (100, 200, 500, 1000 Middleton, 2000 m) had minimal effect on results (Supplementary Material Fig. C). Results from all tests displayed variance anomalies in the same location; however, there was some minor smoothing and decrease in resolution with increasing segment lengths. To balance resolution with computational expenditure, 200\u00a0m segment lengths were selected as optimal; however the difference in computational time was in the order of a few minutes.\n\n\n3.4.3\nPPDRC wavelengths\nThe wavelength used in PPDRC filtering of aeromagnetic grids is a significant parameter for characterizing geologic trends. A range of wavelengths were tested (400, 760, 1480, 2880, 5560, 10,720, 20,720, and 40,000\u00a0m; Supplementary Material Fig. D) and compared to mapped structures as well as geological interpretations. The range of tested wavelengths were chosen by selecting eight equal intervals between a minimum (400\u00a0m) and maximum (40,000\u00a0m) range. Based on these results it was concluded that smaller wavelengths (ideally 1000 and 3000\u00a0m) better characterize geological features, provide the highest resolution, and minimize the effects of intrusions; however, extremely small wavelengths (<1000\u00a0m) introduce a significant amount of noise. For Dryden, where there are few diabase dikes and moderate surface exposure, a wavelength of 2880\u00a0m was selected as an optimal balance between resolution and noise. For Timmins, where diabase dike swarms are prevalent and thick glacial overburden attenuates geophysical signals, a smaller wavelength of 1480\u00a0m was selected to minimize the effect of intrusions and to amplify subtle trends.\n\n\n3.4.4\nGrid resolution\nAnomalies and trends resulting from varied grid resolutions (40\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m line spacing; Supplementary Material Fig. E) were generally co-located; however, results from the higher resolution survey (40\u00a0m) display stronger spatial links to mapped geology, especially in fold hinges, while low resolution results display a larger number of broad anomalies without geologic links at this scale. The input grid resolution parameter is significant in that higher resolution data captures and characterizes smaller trends while low resolution data averages signals. Thus, any results coming from the high resolution data are expected to have increased complexity whereas low resolution results should be smoothed and possibly offset as a function of the averaging nature of regional geophysical surveys. Since 40\u00a0m surveys were available in both map areas, they were used for structural complexity analysis.\n\n\n3.4.5\nNeighborhood population\nA range in minimum neighborhood population (n) values (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) were also tested. In all results, variance anomalies were co-located and similar in form. However, increasing minimum neighborhood populations essentially down-sampled the global population such that fewer points were retained and gridded, thereby limiting surface coverage. To maximize coverage, a minimum neighborhood population value of 3 was selected as optimal.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nAnomalies from regional structural complexity grids (Fig. 11\n) are co-located with interpreted geological features such as shear zones, faults, and fold axes (Fig. 12\n). In general, variance results in both study areas display high values along fold axes and broad low variance anomalies spatially associated with ductile deformation zones. Brittle structures such as (late) faults mark boundaries between adjacent high and low anomalies (Figs. 11 and 12).\n\n4.1\nKilometer-scale folds\nVariance analysis of both the bedding and magnetic lineament data shows a systematic spatial correlation with kilometer-scale folds. Nearly every mapped fold axial trace is associated with high variance anomalies (variance >0.6). Representative results from domains with folds in both study areas are displayed on Figure 12. These include, the Upper Manitou antiform (Figure 12A), Long Lake River antiform (Figure 12B), and Thunder Lake antiform\/synform (Figure 12E) that each correlate to high variance results. Some of these also represent refolded folds (\u201c1\u201d in Figure 12C) and\/or drag folds (\u201c2\u201d in Figure 12A), which are also spatially associated with high variance.\n\n\n4.2\nShear zones\nBroad, linear areas of low variance are spatially associated with mapped shear zones. These zones differ from fold limbs as they display low variance anomalies along a laterally extensive trend (> 10\u00a0km long and\u00a0>\u00a02\u00a0km wide). Examples of low variance related to known shear zones are the Manitou-Dinorwic deformation zone (Figure 12A), Kawashegamuk deformation zone (Figure 12B), Vermillion deformation zone (Figure 12E), and the PDDZ (Figure 12C and F). Additionally, a broad, linear-shaped low variance trend is observed below the northern extent of the Porcupine basin (\u201c3\u201d in Figure 12I).\nCommonly, deformation (shear) zones define boundaries between structural domains and, thus, separate domains of high and low variance. For example, the high variance associated with folds south of the Melgund North deformation zone (\u201c4\u201d in Figure 12D) is truncated by a low variance zone associated with a shear zone to the north.\n\n\n4.3\nFaults\nFaults and other brittle structures are indirectly identified as they often act as boundaries between high and low variance anomalies or are observed to offset anomalies. The best examples of this are observed along northwest-trending faults in the Long Lake River antiform (\u201c5\u201d in Figure 12B), where high variance associated with fold axes are contained and offset by the fault traces. Another example is the north-northwest trending Burrows Benedict Fault (BBF; Figure 12C), which separates high variance spatially associated with fold traces in the west and low variance in the east.\n\n\n4.4\nUnidentified Dikes\nAs a part of lineament extraction, several previously unidentified and\/or unexposed likely Proterozoic, diabase dikes were interpreted from the aeromagnetic grids in Timmins (Figure 7). These were identified as parallel lineaments that crosscut or were at a high angle to mapped volcanic or sedimentary bedding that are also spatially correlated to magnetic lineaments.\n\n\n4.5\nAu and variance\nThe spatial association between known Au mineralization and variance anomalies was quantitatively assessed (Figure 13\n) to determine if variance could be used as a proxy for prospective fluid pathways and traps in mineral exploration applications. The distance between high variance anomalies (>\u03bc\u00a0+\u00a01\u03c3; Dryden: 0.598; Timmins: 0.613), which are co-located with interpreted fold hinges, and mineralization was calculated.\nThe distance between Au mineralization and low variance (<\u03bc - 1\u03c3; Dryden: 0.206; Timmins: 0.189), which are interpreted to be deformation zones and fluid pathways where structures and rock units are transposed into sub-parallel orientations, was also calculated.\nAu deposits and prospects are all located at less than ~1500\u00a0m from a high or less than ~1700\u00a0m from a low variance anomaly (Figure 13). When the distance to nearest high and low anomaly are plotted against one another for each deposit and occurrence, two parallel trends emerge, offset by 1500\u00a0m along both axes (e.g., gray polygons in Figure 13). Point density for deposits and occurrences highlight these trends for minor deposits and occurrences from the Dryden area and major deposits in Timmins. The largest deposits (Dome, Hollinger, McIntryre, Porcupine, Pamour) are all located adjacent (<1000\u00a0m) to either a high or low variance anomaly.\nAlong both trends, Au grade increases towards the x-axis (closer proximity to variance high anomalies and structural traps): i.e., the highest-grade deposits (>7\u00a0g\/T) such as Hollinger, McIntyre, and Hoyle Pond occur within or directly adjacent to (<500\u00a0m) high variance anomalies (e.g., within regional fold hinges); the lowest grade deposits (<3\u00a0g\/T) such as Dome and Porcupine are within or adjacent to (<500\u00a0m) low variance anomalies (e.g., the PDDZ).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nGeological significance\nStatistical analyses and interpretation of remotely sensed data (e.g., geophysics, spectral imagery, digital elevation model, etc.) is becoming common practice (e.g., Gunn et al., 1997; Eaton and Vasudevan, 2004; Feumoe et al., 2012; Coulter et al., 2017; Baratoux, 2019). However, linking anomalies and results to geological features can be challenging (e.g., Aitken and Betts, 2009; Blundell et al., 2019). As stated previously, environmental, anthropogenic, geological, and many other factors can obscure geological, geophysical, and geochemical signals. The results of the structural complexity analysis presented here display a robust spatial correlation to geological features, indicating that circular variance of aeromagnetic lineaments and dispersion of bedding measurements provide quantitative tools to characterize structure in regional scale mapping programs. These methods allow for the calculation of additional quantitative metrics that relate structure to anomalous concentrations of precious metals and are discussed in detail below.\n\n5.1.1\nKilometer-scale folds\nRefined interpretations of fold axial traces were constrained by high variance anomalies, especially in the Dryden map area. Given the isoclinal geometry of folds, bedding along fold limbs is sub-parallel and variance increases with proximity to hinges. Therefore, high variance values in fold hinges would be expected and is commonly observed (Fig. 11). In some cases, high variance also correlates to fold interference patterns (e.g., Perrouty et al., 2017). For example, the anomalously high zone in Timmins (\u201c1\u201d in Fig. 12C) highlights where early isoclinal folds are refolded by later z-folds and drag folding related to the PDDZ (Ayer et al., 2005; Bateman et al., 2008). High variance anomalies (>0.6) are also associated with hinges of drag folds, particularly where early folds are modified by obliquely cross-cutting, younger shear zones in the Dryden area (\u201c2\u201d in Fig. 12A).\nStructural complexity analysis also provides further geological insight into structure poorly defined by field mapping. For example, the location of the Long Lake River antiform axial trace in Dryden is well defined by in the structural complexity results. This structure was originally interpreted by Kresz et al. (1982a, 1982b, 1987) and later refined by Montsion et al. (2019); however, uncertainty in the location and geometry of the structure persisted, in part, due to dense vegetation and glacial overburden coincident with the feature. Using lineament variance results, the axial trace of the fold was extended to the west until it is offset by late northwest-trending faults.\nDispersion results, which capture 3D orientation variance of bedding, can also be used to enhanced structural characterization of folds. For example, a linear low variance anomaly, parallel to the Upper Manitou antiform (Figure 8B), indicates dip direction of the fold based on its position southeast of the fold's axial trace. This interpretation of dip directions is supported field observations.\n\n\n5.1.2\nShear zones and faults\nAnomalous variance zones are sometimes bounded or offset by shear zones and\/or faults. In some cases, the relative offsetting relationship can provide relative timing constraints on deformation features. For example, the Long Lake River antiform is offset by northwest-trending faults (#5 in Fig. 12B), indicating that folding pre-dates faulting. Additionally, shear zones and\/or faults form boundaries between adjacent structural domains. Linear variance tends across these boundaries differ as a result of offsetting (laterally or vertically) continuous stratigraphic packages or juxtaposing distal and unrelated structural blocks.\nThe width of linear-shaped low variance anomalies may also aid in defining the extent of high-strain zones associated with these structures. Traditionally, shear zones are represented as finite lines in geological maps; however, this practice oversimplifies the complex 3D nature of shear zones. This is due to the fact that shear zones affect volumes of rock where progressive strain may be localized into networks of anastomosing fault\/slip planes (Sibson, 1977; Fossen and Cavalcante, 2018; Parsons et al., 2018). Shear zones, especially at crustal-scale, commonly record protracted phases of brittle-ductile deformation. Complexity, represented by variance or dispersion, within these deformation corridors is likely masked by intense transpressive strain along strike, as lineaments would have been passively rotated and\/or sheared into sub-parallel orientations. The sub-parallel orientation of these strained structures appear as linear and low variance anomalies and the intensity of the low anomaly may be indicative of strain intensity. Numerical modeling, which is out of the scope of this contribution, would be required to fully test this relationship.\nNew geological insight and improved map interpretations related to low variance and deformation (shear) zones includes straightening and narrowing the southern extent of the MDDZ, based on low variance trends as well as the location of high variance in adjacent drag fold axis. The Gold Rock deformation zone (GRDZ) was also identified by a linear and low variance trend along a northeast-trending fold axis to the south of the Atikwa-Lawrence batholith (Fig. 12A). Similarly, in the Timmins area, the Pipestone deformation zone (PDZ) is hypothesized to continue below the northern boundary of the Porcupine sedimentary basin. This continuation of the basal fault zone is indicated by a broad, linear, low-variance trend (\u201c3\u201d in Fig. 12I). Due to sparse outcrop exposure, mapping the continuation of this structure has been challenging. Thus, application of the structural complexity method described may provide a means of tracking the fault below glacial cover outside of the present study area.\n\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for Au exploration\nFor both map areas, the spatial relationship between known mineralization and variance anomalies was tested (Fig. 13). Commonly, primary, first-order faults\/shears and associated higher-order faults or splays are prospective in an orogenic system as conduits for mineralized fluids ascending through the crust (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2007; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Groves and Santosh, 2015; Robert et al., 2005; Robert and Poulsen, 2001). As a result, identification of crustal-scale structures and nearby higher-order splays is central to many prospectivity studies (e.g., Carranza and Hale, 2001; Bierlein et al., 2006; Joly et al., 2015; Zhang and Zhou, 2015). For both Dryden and Timmins, low variance anomalies are spatially related to known orogenic Au mineralization (Fig. 13) and, therefore, this correlation may represent identification of major fluid pathways along which Au and related metals were deposited.\nGold mineralization is also commonly observed adjacent to high variance zones, which are interpreted to represent structural traps for fluids such as fold hinges (Fig. 13). The close proximity (<2\u00a0km) between high variance anomalies and mineralization is expected as fluids and precipitated metals may be emplaced in structural traps such as fold hinges (Cox et al., 1991; Goldfarb et al., 2005). Furthermore, the grade of major deposits increases with proximity to structurally complex zones, which may have experienced a protracted structural and hydrothermal history that may have included Au remobilization and, therefore, higher observed grade.\nPatterns in deposit, prospect and occurrence density (Figure 13) highlight similarly oriented trends between both map areas, although an offset of 1500\u00a0m is observed between them. In Timmins, deposits, prospects, and occurrences are uniformly distributed between high and low variance anomalies. In contrast, the distribution of prospects and occurrences in the Dryden area is polarized with clusters proximal to either high or low variance anomalies. Since major deposits are located adjacent to both high and low variance anomalies as opposed to a strong correlation in Timmins, the Dryden area may have experienced a different structural and hydrothermal evolution. Therefore, further research into these aspects of the Dryden region is recommended.\n\n\n5.3\nLimitations and recommendations\nApplications of this technique to improve geological and geophysical mapping should consider the influence of input data, method, analytical parameters, and geologic setting on results. Below, the major influences of these parameters are discussed in detail.\n\n5.3.1\nData availability, density, and quality\nSeveral issues affect data availability and quality of field-based geological maps and their derivative products. These include vegetation cover or severe weathering, which frequently limit outcrop exposure, resulting in locally disparate field measurements, and undersampling of regional-scale structures. Geophysical data such as aeromagnetic grids are biased by survey parameters, environment, anthropogenic effects, and geological settings (e.g., sedimentary cover, primary magnetite content, hydrothermal alteration, etc.). Thus, a balance must be struck between the noise associated with high resolution surveys and the averaging or undersampling effect of coarse surveys.\nAlong with data availability, data density is a significant consideration. To identify a desirable minimum data density for the structural complexity analysis outlined herein, 100\u00a0m lineament segments were sequentially subsampled by 50%, with variance calculated using optimal parameters in Table 3, and derivation of summary statistics for each subsample (Figure 9). These results yield quantitative trends for quartiles, mean, and standard deviation, which increase towards a sill defined by a plateau. The inflection point between the rise and sill is interpreted as the minimum average number of data points for a given neighborhood radius (here 1750\u00a0m). Therefore, assuming a roughly uniform distribution of points, a minimum of two points per km2 is considered as the minimum data density for the application of this structural complexity mapping technique. Dryden bedding measurements have an average point density of 1.8 points per km2, which approaches this minimum threshold. However, the Timmins measurements yield an average density of 0.4 points per km2. In part, this relatively low point density is a result of thick glacial overburden that limits outcrop exposure in portions of the study area. In comparison, Perrouty et al. (2017) applied a similar technique near Malartic, Qu\u00e9bec using a much higher density dataset of bedding measurements (average density of 7.7 points per km2) and determined that variance of bedding strike was spatially related to structurally complex zones and gold mineralization. The higher data density allowed for higher resolution correlations, as opposed to the larger regional view presented for Dryden and Timmins.\n\n\n5.3.2\nPetrophysical considerations\nLineament detection depends on magnetic properties, which are linked to mineralogy of lithologic units and magnetic susceptibility contrast between adjacent layers. If there is insufficient contrast between volcanic and\/or sedimentary layers, strong magnetic remanence (e.g., Koenigsberger Ratio\u00a0>\u00a01; Enkin et al., 2012), or interference from intrusions (i.e., dikes), bedding-related signals may be obscured during lineament extraction. In part, the Timmins study area was selected to test how the presence of dense diabase dike swarms would affect derivative results. During sensitivity testing, a range in PPDRC wavelengths were applied as well as a range in filter radii during lineament extraction. Smaller wavelengths and filter radii were found to be most effective in diminishing the effect of dikes that crosscut stratigraphy. With these parameters and the removal of lineaments within 300\u00a0m of interpreted dike polygons, structural complexity analysis in the variance of lineaments within the Timmins map area is able to characterize regional structural complexity.\n\n\n5.3.3\nMethod selection\n\n5.3.3.1\nVariance\nStructural complexity mapped by circular variance of bedding are generally co-located with interpreted regional structures (Figure 8A and Supplementary Material Figure Aa). When used as an input for variance, field bedding measurements are the most accurate and precise means of capturing primary lithological layering. However, bedding strike variance is disadvantaged by heterogeneously distributed and\/or clustered data that is biased towards preserved outcrop distributions as discussed above (section 5.3.1), which affects both statistical calculations and later grid interpolation as well as the time investment needed to create structural databases.\nSampling bias is prevalent in field-based data sets and, commonly, results in undersampling of regional structure. For example, if only the limbs of an isoclinal fold are observed and characterized, resultant variance will be low since isoclinal fold limbs are sub-parallel. To properly capture the fold, both limbs and hinge should be measured with sufficient data density (see above), or, alternatively, the spherical dispersion calculation may be preferable.\nVariance of magnetic lineament trends (Figure 8C) provides a quantitative means to map structural complexity at regional scales. While aeromagnetic data are affected by intrusions or alteration, they are a continuous, homogenously distributed dataset that minimizes sampling bias. At local scales (<1:30000), variance of aeromagnetic lineaments provides nearly complete coverage but lacks the definition and precision provided by bedding dispersion.\n\n\n5.3.3.2\nDispersion\nSpherical dispersion of the down dip vectors of bedding planes (Figure 8B and Supplementary Material Figure Ab) was calculated to constrain how significant a second orientation component (i.e., dip) affects resultant structural complexity calculations. To evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of dispersion, a visual comparison to results from variance of bedding and lineaments yield was performed. In variance-based results, local anomalies and trends diverge from the dispersion results, particularly at high resolution, indicating that dispersion calculations provide the best representation of structural complexity at local (<1:30000) scales. Furthermore, these anomalies were the most strongly correlated with interpreted geological and geophysical features, especially in hinges of regional folds (Fig. 8B). Thus, in specific instances, the dispersion results provided additional information not obtained by the 2D variance calculations such as dip direction of a fold's axial plane (e.g., to the southeast for the Upper Manitou antiform; Fig. 8B).\nAt a deposit-scale or brownfields setting where data is sufficiently dense and representative of relevant structures, spherical dispersion calculation will likely provide the most robust input for highlighting structural complexity as it provides the best results at higher resolutions. Conversely, the dispersion calculations may under-represent structure at the regional scale where input data is irregularly sampled, sparse, and\/or clustered.\n\n\n\n\n5.4\nBenefits and potential applications\nThe technique discussed here has applications beyond mapping structural complexity using bedding measurements and aeromagnetic data. For example, lineament detection and structural complexity can be used to identify areas where further investigation is required to better constrain interpretations, fill gaps where field measurements are sparse (e.g., greenfield settings), to highlight buried or unidentified intrusions (e.g., dikes or clusters of porphyries), and can characterize subtle intrusive phases in large plutonic bodies. The application of structural complexity mapping may also have greater success in Phanerozoic terranes where shallowly dipping geological features are common (Bally et al., 2012), as opposed to characteristic steeply dipping Archean structures observed in Dryden and Timmins study areas.\nOther input datasets such as digital elevation models (DEM), seismic or gravity surveys (in either 2D and 3D), electromagnetic surveys, and spectral data may also provide a means of capturing structure and complexity that leverage constraints on additional physical rock properties; however, each dataset will have specific use cases.\nMost importantly, this technique has potential as a mapping tool for fluid pathways and traps in mineral prospectivity modeling. Frequently, inputs for prospectivity studies rely heavily on interpretations or knowledge because they integrate geological expertise with observations while providing the spatial continuity needed (e.g., Carranza and Hale, 2001; Bierlein et al., 2006; Joly et al., 2015; Zhang and Zhou, 2015). However, inputs constrained by knowledge-based features are influenced by compounding and unquantified biases that decrease confidence and accuracy of results. In orogenic gold exploration, structural complexity is often represented by overlaying buffers around surface traces of relevant linear structures (e.g., faults, folds) or in structure density maps (Knox-Robinson and Wyborn, 1997; Carranza and Hale, 2001; Bierlein et al., 2006; Kreuzer et al., 2015; Zhang and Zhou, 2015; Campos et al., 2017; Ford, 2019). While these inputs are useful, they lack the rigor of a purely data-driven, quantitative approach such as mapping variance and dispersion of structural measurements.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe increasing influence of computational techniques on geological workflows has fueled the development of tools that improve geological knowledge and interpretations. The spatial distribution of structural complexity was mapped by applying Fisher statistics such as circular variance and spherical dispersion to bedding measurements and auto-detected magnetic lineaments. In general, anomalous results (high or low variance) and interpreted geological structures are co-located. Linear, low variance trends occur along shear zones, which likely reflect parallel and transposed structure in shear zones. These observations were used to refine interpretations, define zones of influence, and track shear and\/or fault zones under cover. Zones of high variance and low dispersion correlate to areas with well-defined folds as constrained from field investigations. Sharp boundaries between high and low variance anomalies are also interpreted to represent shear and\/or fault zones that juxtapose structural blocks.\nGold resources are also spatially associated with adjacent low (within <~1700\u00a0m) and high (within <~1500\u00a0m; highest Au grade within <500\u00a0m) variance anomalies. In the Timmins study area, deposits, prospects, and occurrences are uniformly distributed between high and low variance anomalies; however, in the Dryden area, prospects and occurrences are polarized with clusters proximal to either a high or low variance anomaly. The difference in distribution may imply different structural or hydrothermal evolution, which may have led to contrasting mineral endowment.\nBased on sensitivity testing, variance of magnetic lineaments was determined to be most effective in mapping structural complexity at regional scales. Aeromagnetic datasets provide uniformly distributed data points that more completely capture trends along regional structures. In contrast, field-based measurements that are commonly clustered tend to undersample regional structures (e.g., both limbs and hinge of folds). Conversely, given sufficiently dense data (e.g., 2 measurements per km2 in this study), most likely at a deposit scale, spherical dispersion calculations that integrate the down-dip vector of bedding planes may provide the most comprehensive means of capturing structural complexity and related variance calculations. This may also be applied to mapping strucureal complexity in 3D geological modeling.\nKey considerations when applying the methods presented here are scale, data availability\/quality, data density, and optimization of input parameters (e.g., neighborhood radius, lineament segment length, minimum number of points in neighborhood). Each of these parameters should be considered on a case-by-case basis as they will strongly impact iterative decisions and the resultant structural complexity maps. Additionally, one must take caution since interpretation of variance is dependent on the data used to generate estimates. As a result, inferred zones of anomalous values may simply be due to high frequency noise (high variance) or suppressed signal (low variance) due to interference from local environments.\nAeromagnetic surveys of greenstone belts near Dryden and Timmins, Ontario has allowed us to map structural complexity using a range of parameters and input datasets. When compared to existing geological interpretations, results were used to refine and confirm existing geological interpretations and provide new insights into relative timing and significance of geological features. Ultimately, these results were used to identify potential traps for mineralizing fluids, which can be integrated into subsequent prospectivity analyses for orogenic gold systems.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n\nRegional structural complexity results from A) variance and B) dispersion of bedding measurements; Both maps display poor coverage for the Dryden map area; Grid of variance of strike displays broad high and low variance anomalies that are loosely associated with interpreted structures; Trends for dispersion, however, are chaotic and at a regional scale do not correlate well with geological interpretations; Color ramp of variance result rescaled using percent clip technique in ArcMap (0.5 minimum and 0.5 maximum) and the histogram equalize color rescaling method for dispersion; Coordinates in NAD 83 UTM zone 15N.\n\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n\n200 m lineament segments from (A \u2013 D) Dryden and (E - H) Timmins were used to test the effect of neighborhood radius on variance results.

In the context of the elastic-rebound theory of earthquakes conceptualized by Reid (1910), variability through time in either the initial (pre-earthquake) or final (postearthquake) stress on a fault results in departures from strictly periodic earthquake recurrence and uniform earthquake size. These departures have been formalized as models of slip- and time-predictable fault behaviors (Bufe et al., 1977; Shimazaki and Nakata, 1980; Anagnos and Kiremidjian, 1984; Kiremidjian and Anagnos, 1984) and form the basis of stress renewal models used in time-dependent probabilistic seismic hazard assessments (e.g., Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, 2003; Stirling et al., 2012; Field et al., 2015). However, fluctuations in stress or loading rates, or variations in fault strength or frictional properties, may be expected to result in highly variable strain-accumulation or strain-release histories that are not well described by these idealized models. Indeed, a growing body of paleoseismic data indicates that significant irregularity in strain-release patterns is common. In 1987, Bob Wallace introduced a model characterizing changes in recurrence patterns and slip rates on faults based on observations from the Basin and Range Province (Wallace, 1987). He identified periods of quiescence punctuated by groups of surface-rupturing earthquakes, both on individual faults and regionally, and interpreted this nonuniformity as arising from irregularities in the brittle crust and changes in regional stress, regarding it as typical of faulting in this broad, extensional intraplate setting. A distinction should be made, however, between earthquake clustering among faults in a region, which may involve interfault transfer of stress and can be understood within the framework of elastic-rebound theory, and clustered strain release on a single section of fault, which is not readily explained by a simple renewal process. In the present study, we argue for both types of behavior. Clustered earthquake recurrence, both on and among faults, has been recognized in a variety of tectonic settings worldwide, and a number of mechanisms affecting strain accumulation or release have been proposed, including variations in tectonic loading, postseismic stress redistribution, changes in effective fault strength, and nontectonic loading and unloading of the crust (e.g., Stein et al., 1994; Ch\u00e9ry et al., 2001a, 2001b; Stiros, 2001; Crone et al., 2003; Friedrich et al., 2003; Hetzel and Hampel, 2005; Kenner and Simons, 2005; Hampel and Hetzel, 2006; Oskin et al., 2008; Sieh et al., 2008; Calais et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2012; Benedetti et al., 2013; Calais et al., 2016; Craig et al., 2016; Dolan et al., 2016; Liu and Stein, 2016; Chen et al., 2020).\nIn this paper, we use observations from the short but vigorous history of surface rupturing along a tectonically immature fault to consider physical factors that contribute to temporal clustering of strain release on a single fault, and we place this burst of activity in the context of a regional temporal cluster of large events. We investigate the case of the Bear River fault zone (BRF), a 44-km-long normal fault in Utah and Wyoming that has undergone a period of rapid slip since rupturing to the Earth's surface in the mid-Holocene (West, 1993, 1994; Hecker et al., 2019). The BRF lies within the low-strain-rate periphery of extensional faulting, east of the well-defined Basin and Range physiographic boundary along the Wasatch fault and east of the Intermountain Seismic Belt, and has developed at the intersection of two dissimilar structures active during Rocky Mountains orogenesis (Fig. 1\n). We examine the history and kinematics of surface deformation along the BRF in the context of inherited geologic structure, building on M. W. West's previous mapping of the fault and on his and our own paleoseismic data (West, 1993, 1994; Hecker et al., 2019). Airborne lidar topography of the heavily forested north flank of the Uinta Mountains from an unpublished data set provided by U.S. Forest Service (Ruth Ann Trudell, Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, written commun., 5\/7\/2012) and from a more recent, publicly available data set (U.S. Geological Survey, 2019) enabled us to map scarps and analyze displacement at the southern end of the fault. In addition, we compare the history of BRF earthquakes to a previously identified regional cluster of earthquakes on the northeast margin of the Basin and Range in the Middle Rocky Mountains (McCalpin, 1993) and consider the role of fault interaction and other processes in modulating earthquake recurrence. The dramatic emergence of the BRF at the Earth's surface in the Holocene provides an opportunity to investigate earthquake clustering at an early stage of fault development and to identify what may contribute more generally to clustering of elastic strain release in shallow continental crust.\n\n\n2\nPattern of BRF rupture in the context of preexisting structure\nThe BRF lies at the south end of a zone of Holocene-active normal faults in the Rocky Mountains that accommodates the easternmost distributed deformation related to basin-range extension (Fig. 1b). Here, faulting has overprinted and reactivated portions of regional east-directed thrust faults belonging to the Cretaceous-Paleogene Sevier thrust belt (e.g., Royse et al., 1975; Corbett, 1982; Royse, 1993; West, 1993). These normal faults, with the exception of the BRF, are associated with hundreds to thousands of meters of total throw and have been active repeatedly during the Quaternary and earlier. The BRF lies near the eastern margin of the fold-thrust belt, and the subsurface structural setting as characterized from oil-industry seismic-reflection and drill-hole data (West, 1993, 1994) suggests that this down-to-the-west fault formed along a 4\u20138-km-deep, west-dipping (\u2a8530\u00b0) ramp in the Hogsback thrust fault. West (1993) found no evidence that the BRF displaces the Hogsback thrust, although with the caveat that throw on the BRF may be too small to be resolvable. Middle to late Quaternary normal faulting has been identified along the leading edge of the Hogsback thrust ~10\u00a0km east of the BRF and is associated with regional eastward tilting of geomorphic surfaces (Fig. 1b; West, 1993, 1994; McCalpin et al., 1994, 2004).\nThe structurally immature BRF is approximately 44\u00a0km long and includes synthetic (down-to-the-west) and antithetic strands across a zone up to 7.5\u00a0km wide (inclusive of the coeval Martin Ranch fault scarp in Wyoming; West, 1993, 1994; Fig. 2a). Scarps along portions the BRF display a right-stepping en echelon pattern, consistent with east-west extension superposed on the NE strike of the underlying Hogsback thrust; throw on the BRF diminishes to the north where the strike of the thrust becomes more easterly and thus less favorably oriented for extension (West, 1993, 1994). The south ends of both the BRF and Hogsback thrust intersect the Uinta arch, a Laramide deep-seated basement-cored uplift and first-order structural feature oriented transverse to the fabric of the fold-thrust belt (Fig. 1b and c). The Hogsback, which was active during growth of the arch, may have been buttressed by it along a hypothesized up-to-the south oblique thrust ramp and zone of dextral transpression (Yonkee and Weil, 2011) and appears to have been overridden by the Uinta arch's North Flank thrust during uplift that continued into middle Eocene time (Blackstone, 1977; Beck et al., 1988).\nWhere the BRF encounters folded and faulted sedimentary strata within the deformation zone of the North Flank thrust, there is a major geometric discontinuity in its surface trace. The scarp that defines the main BRF trace breaks up, over a distance of ~1.5\u00a0km, into a zone of fault-tip splays that generally parallel the NE strike of imbricate thrusts and upturned strata and are at high angles to the main trace (Fig. 2b and c). The splay scarps form nested graben that terminate 2\u00a0km to the west against a large, 4-km-long north-trending antithetic scarp that we identified with the aid of lidar imagery and named the \u201cLily Lake\u201d strand because it forms a dam at the lake's outlet. Geomorphic cross-cutting relations among the NE-striking splay faults indicate a southward, archward shift between earthquakes in the location of deformation and local reversals in slip polarity (with yellow scarps overprinting red scarps in Fig. 2b and d). This dynamic and geometrically complex surface faulting appears to accommodate down-dropping of the hanging wall of the BRF against the north flank of the Uinta arch.\nA 0.7-km-wide zone of short subparallel scarps detectable on the lidar imagery extends 6\u00a0km south of the arch-parallel scarps (previously thought to mark the south end of the BRF; West, 1993, 1994). This newly discovered zone of distributed fault strands (Fig. 2b) lies approximately along the strike of the antithetic Lily Lake scarp and appears to cut through the deformation zone of the frontal thrust and into Precambrian basement of the Uinta arch (Middle Proterozoic rocks \u201cYur,\u201d Fig. 2c). As with the NE-striking splay faults, local cross-cutting relations among scarps in this zone provide evidence that at least two earthquakes broke near the south end of mapped rupture.\n\n\n3\nInception of surface faulting and estimates of cumulative displacement\nTopographic relief across the BRF is equivalent to the heights (100\u2013101\u00a0m) of Holocene scarps (West, 1993, 1994); the absence of an escarpment or range front is primary evidence that the fault is neotectonically quite young. The scarps are morphologically youthful, disrupt active floodplains as well as older landforms and are locally associated with abandoned channels, drainage reversals, and ponded water (West, 1993, 1994). Although we cannot preclude an earlier history of dip-slip faulting whose evidence was eroded away or buried, any additional throw on strands of the fault must be less than the ~300-m thickness of the Eocene Wasatch Formation, which is exposed or shallowly buried on both sides of the fault zone over a distance of 26\u00a0km north of the glacial terrain of the Uinta Mountains (Dover and M'Gonigle, 1993; West, 1994; Bryant, 2010). Correlation of Wasatch Formation beds across the fault in trench exposures has proven to be difficult (West, 1994; Hecker et al., 2019), allowing for older faulting, and the BRF in Wyoming is located within a wider zone of air-photo lineaments interpreted as possible faults or fractures (Dover and M'Gonigle, 1993). Unlike the main BRF trace, sections of the short NE-trending splay scarps near the south end of the BRF lie along the base of higher slopes. These hillslopes, which range in height from ~20\u00a0m to over 200\u00a0m and appear to represent long-term cumulative displacements, are underlain by units mapped as either Wasatch Formation bedrock (Bryant, 2010; Fig. 2c) or as a combination of bedrock and glacial till that predates the last major glacial period (and thus is ~100\u00a0ka or older; Munroe and Laabs, 2009). Where the main, west-facing BRF scarp crosses glacial terrain, it is expressed in deposits no older than the last major glaciation (32\u201314\u00a0ka, Munroe and Laabs, 2009; Bryant, 2010), leaving open the possibility of earlier surface deformation that has been buried or eroded by glacial processes. The southern portion of the associated antithetic (Lily Lake) strand cuts obliquely across east-facing hillslopes formed on older till or bedrock, providing possible, though equivocal, evidence of pre-Holocene faulting. In summary, although various indications of older faulting exist, the surface manifestation of a well-integrated BRF is limited to the Holocene.\nThe breadth and complexity of the BRF hampers evaluation of the net tectonic displacement represented by the scarps. Topographic profiles measured in the field at two locations that were accessible (P1 and P2 in Fig. 2a) and where slip is concentrated on a single strand yield vertical-offset estimates of ~8\u00a0m (which accounts for 9\u00a0m of measured offset minus ~1\u00a0m on an unprofiled antithetic scarp) and 4.5\u00a0m down to the west across north-central and south-central portions of the fault, respectively (Fig. 3\n). Scarps along the main trace of the BRF are large, typically 5\u201310\u00a0m high, increasing to 13+ m near the south end in the vicinity of the Uinta arch (West, 1994), where slip on the main strand is largely countered by antithetic faulting on the Lily Lake strand (Fig. 2b). The NE-trending graben complex fronting the arch between the main and Lily Lake strands appears to accommodate down-to-the-NW motion of the hanging-wall block of the BRF against the arch. The short faults that make up this zone, several with scarps that exceed 10\u00a0m in height, may have reactivated older bedrock structures, and their hanging-wall position between the main and antithetic strands suggests they have limited depth penetration.\nUtilizing the lidar point cloud data, we reconstructed the prefaulting glacial landscape to estimate displacement at the south end of the main BRF (Fig. 4\n). Near-surface strain is accommodated by sharply defined monoclinal folding in the glacial cover (Hecker et al., 2019). The main trace of the BRF is linear across undulating glacial-moraine topography (Fig. 4a and c), evidence of a steep near-surface fault dip. Moreover, the narrow width and large amplitude of the scarp is consistent with fault-propagation folding above a steeply dipping fault (e.g., Coleman et al., 2019); hence, we adopted potential dips of 60\u00b0, 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 for our reconstructions. We adjusted the position of the landscape below (west of) the scarp in a 3D view by varying the vertical displacement in 0.5-m increments and calculating the resulting horizontal shifts in position for each of the three fault dips, assuming pure dip-slip motion. The lidar points on the fold scarp were removed prior to reconstruction. The goodness of fit was evaluated visually using digital elevation models, hillshades and contour maps; we assumed that the maps in which contours match most evenly across the fault are the best reconstructions (e.g., Fig. 4b and d). We find that the best-fit vertical displacements are: 11.5\u00a0m (13.3\u00a0m dip-slip) for a 60\u00b0 dip, 12\u00a0m (12.8\u00a0m dip-slip) for a 70\u00b0 dip, and 12.5\u00a0m (12.7\u00a0m dip-slip) for an 80\u00b0 fault dip. These model values are compatible with surface-offset measurements from elevation profiles extracted from the lidar data (Fig. 2b), but do not capture the apparent along-strike variability in slip. We note that removing fault-perpendicular displacement on the NW-striking main fault also restores the landscape across the scarp where it turns and becomes part of the NE-striking zone subparallel to the North Flank thrust (scarp marked with blue arrowheads in Fig. 4a), allowing that there is little or no oblique movement on the main fault.\nAntithetic slip on the Lily Lake strand considerably reduces the net vertical displacement across this large graben to less than about 3\u00a0m, as estimated from surface offsets of opposing scarps, though sharply increasing to more than 6\u00a0m near the north end of the Lily Lake strand (i.e., 13\u00a0m down-to-west movement is countered by ~6.5\u00a0m down-to-east; Fig. 2b). Reconstructing the landscape across the Lily Lake strand from the lidar data is more challenging because the deformation zone is broader and the best-fit reconstruction varies along strike. A southward decrease in best-fit vertical displacements from ~9\u00a0m to ~7\u00a0m coincides with where scarps climb a hillside (Fig. 2b, south of the 10-m offset measurements) and thus may be an artifact of steeper slopes rather than a true decrease in fault throw.\nWithin the narrow, nested graben associated with the North Flank deformation zone, the Lily Lake scarp is higher than the main scarp (~12\u00a0m versus ~9\u00a0m, Fig. 2b), suggesting a reversal in the sense of net displacement here, from down-to-the-west to down-to-the-east. In Section 5.1 we discuss implications of both this observation and the continuation of scarps to the south on the Lily Lake strand but not on the main BRF. The distributed scarps that extend into the Uinta arch along the Lily Lake strand (Fig. 2b) are small (<2\u00a0m high), both east- and west-facing, and constitute little net displacement. Our estimates of net cumulative offset across the BRF, which range from <3 to ~8\u00a0m, are sparsely distributed along strike but nevertheless provide a basis for constraining the amount of slip in individual earthquakes, as addressed in Section 4.4.\n\n\n4\nPaleoseismic results and interpretations\n\nWest (1989, 1994) carried out an extensive paleoseismic investigation of the BRF for his PhD dissertation, logging exposures and dating colluvial stratigraphy at eight locations along the fault. His simplest, most compelling event record comes from a site on the northern part of the fault at Lester Ranch, where a trench exposed the fault and a stacked pair of colluvial wedges separated by an organic-rich soil horizon. Combining age constraints from several sites, West interpreted that the earliest surface-rupturing earthquake on the fault occurred between 5.3 and 3.9\u00a0ka and was followed by a second event between 3.4 and 1.3\u00a0ka.\nMotivated to better understand the short, large-displacement history of the BRF, we dug additional paleoseismic trenches; in Hecker et al. (2019), we document structural, stratigraphic, and geomorphic observations and age data from three sites, including two explored by West, one at Lester Ranch and the other at \u201cBig Burn\u201d near the fault's south end (Fig. 2a). Our third site is on the previously unmapped antithetic Lily Lake strand at a site opposite Big Burn. In each of the trenches we found evidence of three earthquakes, the two identified by West (as indicated by similarity in timing constraints) and a third, younger event. The third event is clearly evident at the Lily Lake site but is only weakly expressed at Big Burn and Lester Ranch. In the following sections, we summarize our observations and event interpretations at each site, plus present possible evidence at Lily Lake for a fourth, older (initial) event. We then present analyses of earthquake timing based on radiocarbon and luminescence dating informed by stratigraphic ordering and the beginning of the historical period.\n\n4.1\nLily Lake site on antithetic fault\nOur highest-confidence record is from a trench at the Lily Lake site (~125\u00a0m north of the namesake lake). Here, the east-dipping antithetic fault is expressed as an uphill-facing monoclinal fold scarp that creates a prominent hillside bench and a vertical ground-surface offset of 6.5\u00a0m (Fig. 5\n, upper panel). The trench, which was sited where the inner edge of the bench forms a small topographic low, exposed dominantly fine-grained depression-fill deposits overlying an eastward-tilted sequence of mass-wasting and alluvial deposits. These, in turn, unconformably overlie folded glaciofluvial deposits exposed beneath the outer edge of the bench (Fig. 5). We obtained an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of ~15.9\u00a0ka from a sample near the top of the glacial deposits (Fig. 5, upper panel; Hecker et al., 2019), consistent with the mapping of a Pinedale-age glacial outwash unit by Bryant (2010). The exposed section is cut by several minor down-to-the-east faults and most notably by a fault that displaces the depression infill and the modern soil A horizon and forms a ~15-cm-high scarp at the ground surface (m 14, upper panel of Fig. 5).\nWe interpret stratigraphic and structural relations in the Lily Lake trench as evidence of three surface-deforming earthquakes. The initial event folded the glaciofluvial sediments that underlie the hillside (light blue unit in Fig. 5). This deformation created a hillside trough, deepened by erosion, into which debris-flow, channel-flow and slope deposits accumulated. The next event tilted the trough-fill sequence eastward on the limb of the growing monocline and created a depression at the toe of the scarp that then filled with mostly fine-grained sediment (brown unit, Fig. 5). Deformation in the third, most recent event is identified from a single but well-expressed fault strand that displaces the depression-fill deposits. Slip in this event appears to be small, accounting for ~15\u00a0cm of brittle deformation and possibly slight eastward tilting of the ground surface. In the reconstruction shown in the lower panel of Fig. 5, we have removed deformation in the penultimate and most recent events by rotating the trough-fill deposits to horizontal. With this restoration (and allowing for removal of possible additional folding), ~3.5\u20134\u00a0m of the 6.5\u00a0m of vertical separation remains, suggesting that between a half and two-thirds of the cumulative slip on the Lily Lake strand occurred in the initial event.\nAn alternative interpretation is that the large \u201ctrough-forming event\u201d actually comprises two events, which is a possibility suggested by evidence not considered in Hecker et al. (2019). Specifically, alluvium that fills a channel cut into the glaciofluvial deposits (yellow unit in Fig. 5) may be faulted and folded more than the rest of the trough-fill sequence. The lower contact of the channel fill is vertically displaced twice as much as the upper contact (at m 21, upper panel of Fig. 5), which is consistent with a two-event interpretation. However, this relation could also (and was originally thought to) be produced by upward-decreasing displacement in a single event, and the lack of displacement farther upsection on this strand is consistent with this interpretation. A second observation suggestive of an earlier event comes from the geometry of the channel deposit at its eastern end (at m 18). Even after the section has been backrotated to remove deformation in the penultimate and most recent events (Fig. 5, lower panel), the contact here between channel alluvium and glaciofluvial sediments appears to be too flat to be the margin of a channel and the contact with overlying trough-fill deposits appears to be too steep to be the top. Additional rotation of the channel (another event) could resolve these issues, although this would necessitate substantial scouring and removal of alluvium to explain the resulting dip of the upper contact farther west. In sum, these observations suggest a possible fourth event in the Lily Lake record. However, because the evidence is equivocal, we favor the three-event interpretation.\n\n\n4.2\nBig Burn and Lester Ranch sites on main fault\nThe trench exposures at our two sites on the main trace of the BRF showed evidence of two large surface-deforming events and a possible smaller, later event. At both sites, we regard the quality of evidence for the first two events to be moderate to high, while evidence for the third event is relatively weak. We summarize event-related observations and interpretations below and refer the reader to Hecker et al. (2019) for further documentation.\nLike Lily Lake, the Big Burn site is on glacial deposits, and deformation is accommodated principally by monoclinal folding. Also similar to the Lily Lake site, sediment has accumulated in a depression at the base of the scarp; at Big Burn, however, topographic closure is created in part by hummocky glacial-till morphology. The ground surface at the site has been tectonically separated ~13\u00a0m, but preexisting relief contributes to a local scarp height of 17\u00a0m. Because of the extraordinary size and steepness (~32\u00b0) of the scarp, we trenched only the lower portion of the slope and the adjacent depression. Event evidence takes the form of three <1-m thick colluvial deposits that overlie and interfinger with finer-grain depression-fill sediments (Fig. 6\n, upper panel). The most recent colluvium has a matrix-supported texture suggestive of flow or creep mobilization and, therefore, whether it has a genetic relationship to growth of the scarp is uncertain. The total thickness of scarp-related deposition is much less than expected for a 17-m-high fault scarp, which is one indication that the scarp originated from folding rather than offset of the ground surface (Hecker et al., 2019). The sequence of colluvial and depression-fill deposits postdate (truncate and bury) a soil Btk horizon developed in the glacial till, which implies that the scarp is considerably younger than the glacial landscape mapped as Pinedale age by Bryant (2010) and dated at ~13.3\u00a0ka from an OSL age from near the top of the till (sample OSLB3, Fig. 6, upper panel; Hecker et al., 2019, appendix 1). In the earlier trench at this site, located a short distance north of ours, West (1994) identified several wedge and fissure infill deposits at the base of the scarp and inferred that at least two surface-faulting events had taken place.\nThe Lester Ranch site lies near the north end of the BRF within a 3.5-km-wide zone of en echelon strands where the fault makes a right step and changes to a northeasterly strike (Fig. 2a). The trenched scarp records ~6\u00a0m of down-to-the-west vertical separation and is the most prominent of the zone, which comprises both synthetic and antithetic strands. A thin veneer of coarse pediment alluvium overlies Eocene sedimentary bedrock here and, in contrast to sites to the south on thick glacial deposits, the fault has ruptured through to the ground surface.\nOur trench revealed a 6-m-wide zone of faults that accommodates the displacement and three elongate deposits of colluvium, which grade laterally into a thin basin-fill deposit (Fig. 6, lower panel). The top of the lowermost (E3) colluvial unit is marked by a slight difference in colour and texture that is interpreted as evidence of soil formation between two displacement events. The upper portion of the overlying (E2) colluvium is laterally extensive, has a large wash-facies (fine-grained) component, and appears to be related to displacement on the eastern fault located at the midsection of the scarp (at m 11.5, lower panel of Fig. 6). However, because of its thickness and position on the slope, its genesis is not entirely clear. Whereas the E3 colluvium is displaced by faulting, the E2 colluvium is not. We were able to trace faint fractures into the E2 colluvium at a number of locations, however, and we identified small open fractures along minor faults in the carbonate-cemented Pleistocene alluvium on the upthrown block. We tentatively interpret these observations as evidence of a recent third event having little or no displacement (perhaps only surface cracking) at the site. In addition, we identified a possible debris-slide deposit (translated mass of fine-grained colluvium; labeled \u201cE1?\u201d in lower panel of Fig. 6) at the toe of the scarp that we infer to have occurred during this most recent earthquake. We speculate here that a similar coseismic slope failure may have occurred during the penultimate event, as an explanation for the concave geometry of the contact between E2 colluvium and bedrock above the eastern fault. West (1994) also interpreted slumping off the scarp, in a trench 200\u00a0m to the south at his Lester Ranch South site.\nWest's original Lester Ranch trench, ~30\u00a0m north of ours, exposed a simple two-event record marked by a single fault strand and two well-developed wedges (West, 1993, 1994). This exposure has been cited as a textbook example of vertically stacked colluvial wedges (McCalpin, 2009, p. 227). We note, however, that the soil A-horizon developed in the upper wedge thickens considerably at the toe of the scarp (trench log in Fig. 7\n), and we suspect it may include the deposit that in our trench we logged as a debris slide, likely seismically triggered. This correspondence in stratigraphy, and more significantly, the suggestion of a shear fabric that extends into the upper wedge in West's trench exposure (Hecker et al., 2019, sheet 3) are consistent with our interpretation of a possible third event at the site.\n\n\n4.3\nPaleoearthquake chronology\nSimilar to West's approach, our analysis of earthquake ages presumes that events identified at one site correlate with events at other sites on the BRF, given that earthquakes with displacement on the order of a meter or more are typically associated with rupture lengths greater than 30\u00a0km (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994). Our preferred interpretation, then, is that the BRF has been host to three large, surface-deforming earthquakes in the Holocene. A possible fourth, earlier event in the Lily Lake record was not recognized in the other two trenches. We note, however, that the oldest scarp colluvium in the Big Burn trench grades laterally into and may partly overlie depression-fill deposits (Fig. 6, upper panel), allowing for the possibility that an earlier folding event initiated sedimentation but did not produce a discrete colluvium.\nClosed depressions are favorable environments for the accumulation of fine-grained sediments and organics, which provide targets, respectively, for luminescence and radiocarbon (14C) dating. The depressions created by folding of glacial deposits near the south end of the BRF yielded samples that constrain the timing of the earliest earthquake (E3) at Big Burn and the penultimate and most recent earthquakes (E2 and E1) at Lily Lake. At Lester Ranch, well-developed soil A horizons buried by and developed on scarp colluvium in the original trench were sampled for bulk soil organics by West (1994) and provide 14C constraints on the timing of E3 and E2.\nWe estimate earthquake ages using the radiocarbon calibration and chronologic modeling software OxCal, which uses Bayesian statistics to model the timing of undated events (e.g., earthquakes) in the context of available chronological constraints and stratigraphic ordering information (Bronk Ramsey, 2001, 2009; Lienkaemper and Bronk Ramsey, 2009). OxCal generates probability density functions (PDFs) and statistical summaries for the timing of undated events. In our modeling, we use the \u201cBoundary\u201d command to represent earthquake events rather than the alternative \u201cDate\u201d command because the former is less sensitive to uneven density of sampling and episodic sedimentation (e.g., DuRoss et al., 2011).\nFor the Big Burn site, we obtained ages on sediment and detrital charcoal sampled from near the base of the depression fill (Fig. 6, upper panel), and from these we generated a pair of OxCal models with slightly different constraints (Fig. 7, left panel). Model 1 treats the three spatially close samples (two OSL and one 14C) as a \u201cPhase\u201d without stratigraphic ordering, and model 2 considers the two OSL ages (~4.5\u00a0ka and ~3.4\u00a0ka) to be part of a stratigraphically ordered sequence of constraints and omits the slightly older 14C age (~4.9\u00a0ka), under the assumption that it reflects the inherited age of the wood or sample reworking. We excluded from both models a stratigraphically inconsistent (too old) age of 9.4\u00a0ka from a sample adjacent to the E3 wedge (OSLB4, upper panel of Fig. 6), a location that suggests a colluvial origin in which daylight exposure may have been insufficient to completely bleach the sand grains. We also omitted a 14C date (2.6\u00a0ka) from a sample near the far western end of the depression fill (R-B6) whose relation to the sequence of deformation events is unclear. For completeness, we included in both models the OSL constraint on the age of the till (13.3\u00a0ka) and used the Boundary command to demarcate the end of glacial deposition. This effectively creates a hiatus and conceptually incorporates the period of landform stability inferred from the soil Btk horizon. We found, however, that leaving out this OSL date and using only the required Boundary command at the base (start) of the model sequence produces essentially the same results for E3. Model outputs show distributions (PDFs) for E3 that are strongly asymmetric and have peaks toward dates from the lower depression fill (Fig. 7, left panel), which is compatible with our reasoning that deposition was initiated by, and closely followed, surface deformation. The timing of E3 in model 1 lies between 4.8 and 9.3\u00a0ka (95% confidence range), while the statistical mode (highest-probability value) of the distribution is 5.0\u00a0ka. Model 2 yields an age range of 4.2\u201310.2\u00a0ka with a modal value of 4.6\u00a0ka. Considering the model results to be equally valid provides a preferred estimate of ~4.6\u20135.0\u00a0ka for timing of the initial large earthquake on the BRF.\nFor the Lily Lake record, we generated a single Oxcal model that incorporates 14C ages on six detrital charcoal samples from depression-fill deposits and three charred plant fragments (two pinecone scales and a pine needle) from an organic mat at the base of the modern soil A horizon (Fig. 8\n). The three oldest samples are from a zone of disseminated charcoal at the bottom of the depression. These latter ages, which are nearly identical (~3.2\u20133.3\u00a0ka), are treated as a Phase; a fourth charcoal age from this interval (and east of the section shown in Fig. 8) is ~1\u00a0k.y. older than the rest and was excluded from the model. The remaining three charcoal ages are from higher in the section at a common elevation and are grouped as a separate Phase; their ages are close (~0.6\u20130.8\u00a0ka), although the youngest fails to overlap at 95% confidence. Finally, the charred plant remains, which were picked from a bulk soil sample, form a third Phase having similar ages (~0.26\u20130.44\u00a0ka; the older two are nearly identical). Because the entire depression-fill sequence postdates earthquake E2 and predates E1, the 14C ages provide minimum-limiting and maximum-limiting timing constraints on E2 and E1, respectively. The most recent earthquake, E1, does not appear in the historical record, which began with founding of Fort Bridger ~30\u00a0km to the northeast of the BRF in 1842 and, more regionally, with the settling of Salt Lake Valley ~90\u00a0km to the west in about 1847. We use the 1842 constraint in our model. Because of its negligible effect on model output, we omitted the glaciofluvial OSL age of ~15.9\u00a0ka. The timing PDFs for both earthquakes are asymmetrically left-skewed, with peaks toward younger constraints (Fig. 8, left panel). E2 is constrained at 95% confidence to have occurred between 3.3 and 4.5\u00a0ka; the mean is 3.7\u00a0ka, whereas the mode is 3.4\u00a0ka. E1 is bracketed between 108 and 286\u00a0yr\u00a0B.P. (1842 CE and 1664), with mean and modal timing, respectively, of 183\u00a0yr\u00a0B.P. (1767 CE) and 110\u00a0yr\u00a0B.P. (1840 CE). We suspect that the lack of identifiable potential aftershocks in the historical earthquake catalog (Fig. 1a) means that E1 occurred at least several decades prior to the mid-19th century.\nAge dating results from West's original Lester Ranch trench (West, 1989, 1994) provides independent timing information for earthquakes E3 and E2. We generated an OxCal model utilizing the 14C ages on bulk organics sampled from the ground surface below the E3 wedge (~5.1\u00a0ka; pre-E3 constraint), from the soil formed on the E3 wedge (~4.4\u00a0ka; post-E3; pre-E2), and from the base of the soil formed on the E2 wedge (~2.6\u00a0ka; post-E2) (Fig. 7, right panel). To account for the mean residence time of carbon in the soils, we applied a correction of 300\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0200\u00a0years (value used for central Utah soils, e.g., DuRoss et al., 2011) using the Delta_R command in OxCal, which applies a shift to dates before calibration (Bronk Ramsey, 2020). This straightforward model produces symmetrical event-timing PDFs with means of 4.7\u00a0ka and 3.5\u00a0ka for E3 and E2, respectively. The corresponding 95% confidence (and essentially equivalent two-sigma) ranges are 3.9\u20135.5\u00a0ka and 2.4\u20134.7\u00a0ka. The confidence range for E3 from the Lester Ranch record is mostly encompassed within the broader, though favorably skewed, timing uncertainty for E3 from model 2 of the Big Burn chronology, and the mean age (4.7\u00a0ka) from Lester Ranch is almost identical to the mode (4.6\u00a0ka) from Big Burn model 2. The timing uncertainty for E3 from Big Burn model 1 is less compatible with Lester Ranch, although their distributions overlap. The 95% confidence range for E2 from the Lester Ranch model encompasses the age range for E2 from the Lily Lake model, and the mean from Lester Ranch (3.5\u00a0ka) is similar to the mode (3.4\u00a0ka) from Lily Lake. Although the timing of E1 is not directly constrained at Lester Ranch, 14C dating of plant fragments (Artemisia and unidentified hardwood charcoal) sampled from our later trench from just beneath the deposits interpreted as a debris slide triggered by E1 (sample R-LR1, lower panel of Fig. 6) yielded a date of 1630\u20131450\u00a0CE, indistinguishable from the plant-fragment ages that constrain the timing of E1 at Lily Lake (Fig. 8; Hecker et al., 2019).\nOur analysis of paleoearthquake ages combined from trench sites along the fault indicates that the three earthquakes interpreted as constituting the surface-rupturing history of the BRF all occurred since the middle Holocene, at ~4.6\u00a0ka, ~3.4\u00a0ka and ~0.2\u00a0ka (Figs. 7 and 8), with the first two earthquakes most likely separated by an interval of only ~1\u00a0k.y. We have noted evidence of a possible fourth (oldest) event at Lily Lake, and we cannot preclude the possibility of other, small-displacement events that were not identified owing to lack of distinct evidence or the obscuring effects of overprinting (e.g., Hecker et al., 2013).\n\n\n4.4\nRupture lengths, slip and paleoearthquake magnitudes\nThe first two earthquakes on the BRF, E3 and E2, appear to account for nearly all of the surface displacement (e.g., Fig. 5) and, considering our estimates of ~3\u20138\u00a0m of cumulative vertical displacement along the fault, likely had average per-event displacements of at least 2\u00a0m. This amount of slip is compatible with rupture of the entire 44-km length of the fault (e.g., Wells and Coppersmith, 1994). We infer that these earthquakes were similar in size to the 1959\u00a0M 7.3 Hebgen Lake, Montana earthquake, one of the largest-recorded continental normal-faulting earthquakes, which had a geometrically complex rupture with a length of 25\u201334\u00a0km (depending on whether overlap in the major strands is included) and an average vertical displacement of ~2.5\u20132.9\u00a0m (Caskey et al., 1996; Wesnousky, 2008). The large displacement-to-length ratio and correspondingly high stress drop (Barrientos et al., 1987) of the Hebgen Lake earthquake may be a general attribute of large events on structurally immature normal faults in the Rocky Mountain region (Hecker et al., 2010).\nThe most recent earthquake on the BRF (E1) appears to have been smaller, as suggested by the small amount of displacement (~15\u00a0cm) recorded in the trench on the antithetic Lily Lake strand and weak expression in the Big Burn and Lester Ranch trenches. A lack of clear stratigraphic or structural evidence may explain why this event was not recognized prior to work at the Lily Lake site. No more than minor (cm-scale) surface displacement occurred in E1 at the Lester Ranch site, which lies 10\u00a0km south of the north end of the BRF. Although some slip may have occurred on synthetic parallel strands of the fault, the lack of slip on the main strand suggests that E1 died out short of the fault's north end, perhaps in association with the right step and change to a northeasterly strike in this area (Fig. 2a). Based on global empirical data, surface rupture lengths of 25\u201333\u00a0km (distance between Lester Ranch site and either a few km south of Lily Lake or the south end of mapped rupture) typically produce earthquakes of M ~6.7\u20136.9 with average displacements of 0.6\u20130.8\u00a0m (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994).\n\n\n4.5\nOff-fault evidence of large BRF earthquakes\nEarly in our investigations, we identified geomorphically fresh circular depressions up to 5\u00a0m in diameter on the Bear River flood plain near the south end within ~1\u00a0km of the BRF (Figs. 2b and 9\n). Although resembling liquefaction sand-blow craters, they are steep-sided and thus appear too youthful to be associated with the late Holocene earthquake that had been identified as the most recent by West. Only after we found evidence of a third, very young (1664\u20131842 CE) event at the Lily Lake site did we become convinced that these features have a sand-blow origin. They are comparable in size and general morphology to the liquefaction-artesian fountain craters that formed during the 1983\u00a0M 6.9 Borah Peak, Idaho earthquake within ~6\u00a0km of the causative fault (Fig. 9). A reconnaissance search in Google Earth identified suspected sand blows 30\u00a0km east of the BRF (40\u00b0 57.56\u2032, \u2212110\u00b0 27.07\u2032), a distance consistent with an earthquake of at least M 6.8 (fig. 20 in Tuttle et al., 2019).\nA paper by Munroe and Laabs (2020) presents credible evidence of strong ground shaking produced by the earliest earthquake (E3 or a less likely E4) on the BRF. In their study, the authors analyzed sediment cores from 20 lakes in the Uinta Mountains to interpret postglacial environmental change, but they had difficulty explaining a perturbation at ~4.5\u00a0ka in only the six lakes cored at the western end of the range (all located within 20\u00a0km of the BRF). The perturbation is characterized by notably finer-grained, organic-poor clastic material, including a ~1-cm-thick clay layer in four of the cores. This interval is associated in some cores with terrestrial macrofloral remains and, in one core, with a small pebble. Vigorous seismic shaking causing tree falls, rockfalls and avalanches, and large quantities of dust could explain the perplexing characteristics of the layer and \u201cmakes perfect sense\u201d (Jeff Munroe, Middlebury College, written commun., 5\/12\/20). Radiocarbon dates on conifer needles from this interval in four of the cores have calibrated ages that overlap and a combined age of 4420\u20134530\u00a0cal\u00a0yr B.P. (Munroe, written commun.). Because conifer needles are short-lived and, in this scenario, the influx of material was triggered by shaking, we regard this age as a tight constraint on earthquake timing. We interpret the event to be E3 because the age agrees well with our OxCal modeling of E3 from Lester Ranch and Big Burn model 2, whereas the age lies at the older end of modeled 95% confidence ranges for E2 and, in the Lily Lake model, within the low-probability tail of the distribution.\n\n\n4.6\nTiming of BRF earthquakes in context of regional clustering\nThe first two earthquakes on the BRF occurred during a mid- to late Holocene period of elevated activity in the Middle Rocky Mountains, when large earthquakes occurred on many, if not most, Quaternary faults in the region (McCalpin, 1993; illustrated in Fig. 10\n). The paleoearthquakes closest to the BRF were on the Rock Creek fault, 70\u00a0km along-strike to the north (Fig. 1b), and are essentially the same age \u2014within dating uncertainty\u2014as E3 and E2. Event timing on the Rock Creek fault is estimated by McCalpin and Haller (2011) to be ~4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0ka and ~3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0ka based on uncalibrated radiocarbon ages on buried soils and charcoal. We ran an OxCal model using available data from this source and obtained event times of 5.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 and 3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0ka (two sigma uncertainty). This pair of earthquakes was preceded by at least 10\u00a0k.y. of quiescence and appears to constitute a period of high strain release on the fault (McCalpin and Haller, 2011). Several other major faults in the region (Greys River, Grand Valley, Teton, and possibly Eastern Bear Lake) had earthquakes in a similar timeframe as the initial event on the BRF (McCalpin, 1993, 1994; Black et al., 2010; McCalpin et al., 2011; Pierce and Haller, 2011; DuRoss et al., 2020). Recent paleoseismic results for the southern Teton fault, located at the north end of the belt of regional activity (Fig. 1b), indicate that the most recent event there occurred 4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0ka (one sigma OxCal model age; DuRoss et al., 2020), close in time to the earthquakes on the BRF and Rock Creek fault. Some mid- to late Holocene earthquakes in the region appear to be temporally distinct from those on the BRF, however, and no fault is known to have had a paleoearthquake similar in timing to the most recent (pre-1842) earthquake on the BRF (Fig. 10), although a magnitude ~6.3 earthquake on the Bear Lake fault zone in 1884 (Evans et al., 2003) may have followed it within decades.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nImpact of the Uinta arch on BRF development and strain release\nAs we have mapped and described, the surface trace of the BRF displays a first-order discontinuity where it intersects the complex structure at the north flank of the Uinta arch (Fig. 2b and c). Here, the main strand of the BRF ends, breaking up into an array of orthogonal, arch-parallel splay faults and graben that appears to accommodate downdropping of the hanging wall of the BRF against the north flank of the arch. This southernmost section of the main fault, with its exceptionally large scarp, is paired with a major antithetic fault, the Lily Lake strand, resulting in no more than a few meters of net slip across the fault zone in this area. And, significantly, within the narrow graben fronting the arch, displacement is greater on the Lily Lake strand than on the main fault, indicating a reversal in net slip from down-to-the-west to down-to-the-east and suggesting that the Lily Lake strand becomes the master fault. Consistent with this interpretation, distributed rupture continues to the south into the Uinta block along the strike of the Lily Lake strand. In Fig. 11\n, we present a simple conceptual model of subsurface fault geometry at the junction of the BRF with the north flank of the arch implied by our interpretation of surface observations.\nThe complex pattern of surface rupture and displacement at the south end of the BRF appears to correspond with differences in rock strength. The hanging-wall block between the main and Lily Lake strands breaks away from the Uinta arch along the arch-parallel splay faults; these secondary structures likely follow imbricate thrusts, lithologic contacts or geomechanical weak layers within the upturned, NE-striking sedimentary strata of the North Flank deformation zone. In contrast, the southern continuation of the Lily Lake strand cuts through the deformed Paleozoic rocks and into older, stronger Precambrian rocks of the arch. We speculate that this zone of minor distributed rupture may be the consequence of dynamic rock fracturing driven by a high concentration of stress and large slip gradient at depth. At the surface, vertical displacement on the Lily Lake fault decreases abruptly from ~12\u00a0m to <3\u00a0m over a distance of less than a kilometer in the vicinity of the North Flank thrust (Fig. 2b). A southward shift between earthquakes in the activation of splay faults, as well as reversals in slip polarity on some strands, suggests complex rupture energetics and rapid evolution of fault geometry at this high-stress juncture. The apparent switch in this area to the Lily Lake strand as the master fault is further evidence of a major geomechanical discontinuity here that creates an impediment to rupture and an abrupt change in fault kinematics.\nGiven its profound effect on seismogenic rupture, could the Uinta arch also be responsible for the late and energetic emergence of the BRF? We hypothesize that the strength and weight of this relatively dense basement-cored uplift (see Behrendt and Thiel, 1963), including a possibly greater thickness of seismogenic crust, created an obstruction that delayed development of a through-going BRF; as well, the structurally high position of the arch created overburden stresses that suppressed strain release on the subjacent portion of the fault. In this context, we speculate below on the evolution of the BRF and its very recent development into a source of large-magnitude earthquakes.\nPrior to breaking through to the surface in the Holocene, the BRF underwent an indeterminate period of development, presumably governed by slow regional extension. The present-day regional velocity field is poorly constrained (the nearest GPS station at the longitude of the BRF is 65\u00a0km to the north), but appears to constitute generally westward motion of <1\u00a0mm\/yr, equivalent to <2 nanostrain\/yr of extension, relative to a stable North America (Kreemer et al., 2012; Payne et al., 2012; McCaffrey et al., 2013; Schmeelk et al., 2017). We surmise that, over time, concentration of stress and resulting localization of strain within the incipient BRF lengthened and linked a complex array of preexisting and precursory faults and sets of fractures that included the Hogsback thrust ramp, in a manner consistent with field observations of early-stage faulting (Crider and Peacock, 2004). This is not unlike the initial phase of extension on the Hogsback thrust inferred by West (1993). Simultaneously, however, fault slip was mechanically obstructed to the south by the Uinta arch. The south end of the BRF was buttressed against and below competent rocks of the arch and subject to the lithostatic pressure exerted by the uplift; this presumably allowed for a significant buildup of elastic strain energy. Geologic and geophysical investigations to better characterize the rheology and isostatic properties of the Uinta arch in this area, as well as the subsurface geometry of the BRF, are needed to evaluate this supposition.\nAt some point, approximately 4500\u00a0years ago as indicated by paleoseismic observations, the BRF underwent a leap in its development, rupturing to the surface over a distance of at least 35\u00a0km and over a zone up to 7.5\u00a0km wide. The main rupture formed scarps ~2- to >5-m-high that terminated in a complex set of graben at the intersection of the fault with the north flank of the arch. This initial earthquake was followed, after an interseismic interval of only ~1\u00a0k.y., by a second comparable earthquake and then, ~3\u00a0k.y. later, by an earthquake with apparently smaller surface displacements and a shorter rupture. In the simplest scenario, the first large earthquake on the BRF occurred when precursory, constituent fault strands had become sufficiently integrated and enough shear stress had accumulated to overcome the buttressing effect of the arch. Alternatively, the fault could have been locked in a critically stressed state for some time until a change in deviatoric stress, or a decrease in frictional strength, destabilized it.\nAccelerated slip on some normal faults during the Holocene, such as on the Wasatch and Teton faults, has been attributed to postglacial unloading and associated isostatic rebound of the lithosphere; numerical modeling has shown that how a fault responds may be largely controlled by the magnitude and distribution of the load and the viscosity of the asthenosphere (Hetzel and Hampel, 2005; Hampel and Hetzel, 2006; Hampel et al., 2007). During latest Pleistocene glaciation, the core of the western Uintas was covered by a broad ice field, and valley glaciers of the Bear River drainage advanced onto the footwall and hanging wall of the southern ~15\u00a0km of the BRF (Munroe and Laabs, 2009). The potential impact of deglaciation of the Uinta Mountains between ~16 and 14\u00a0ka on the stress environment of the BRF is unknown, although the ~10-k.y. time lag before the first large earthquake suggests that any causal effect was imparted gradually or was too small to activate the fault.\nEvidence that the BRF was \u201cborn big\u201d is compatible with a fault growth model proposed by Walsh et al. (2002) in which nearly final fault length is established early. Continued fault growth occurs principally through accumulation of displacement, with the largest earthquakes rupturing the entire fault. This model maintains that fault lengths are inherited from reactivation of preexisting structures, just as the extent of the BRF appears to be related to normal reactivation of the Hogsback thrust ramp where it is favorably oriented for east-west extension, as well as the obstructing presence of the Uinta arch to the south.\nThe vigorous recent surface-rupturing history of the BRF makes it one of the most active faults in the eastern Basin and Range, with mid- to late Holocene recurrence intervals and an incremental vertical displacement rate (~2\u00a0mm\/yr between the initial events) similar to the structurally much more mature central segments of the Wasatch fault (DuRoss et al., 2016). For additional perspective, if the BRF is subject to <2 nanostrain\/yr of extension, a value from regional GPS data (e.g., Kreemer et al., 2012), across an aperture of ~20\u201330\u00a0km, which approximates distances to neighboring faults, it should have a long-term horizontal slip rate of <0.04\u20130.06\u00a0mm\/yr. This is equivalent to a vertical rate of <0.07\u20130.1\u00a0mm\/yr for a fault dip of 60\u00b0. Given this rate, if the average vertical displacement in the first two earthquakes is assumed to be 2.5\u00a0m per event, the average time between those earthquakes is calculated to be >25\u201336\u00a0k.y., more than an order of magnitude longer than the ~1\u00a0k.y. interval observed.\nWhether the BRF is currently operating in a mode of elevated strain release is unknown, although the longer recurrence interval and smaller slip in the most recent event is consistent with transition to a lower, longer-term slip rate. Liu and Stein (2016) proposed a simple conceptual model in which prestored strain energy is released on reactivated faults to explain earthquake clustering in the New Madrid seismic zone. They considered the potential of strong unfaulted crust to store strain energy and the expectation that seismic release should gradually decay through time as the stored strain is depleted. The partial release of accumulated strain in a large earthquake is a concept underpinning a recently proposed probability model by Salditch et al. (2020) that aims to simulate the effect of clustering, or supercycles, on earthquake recurrence.\n\n\n5.2\nEarthquake clustering on immature faults: a matter of strength and length?\nIn the previous section, we proposed that the Uinta arch, due to its strength and weight, may have delayed or prolonged development of the BRF and allowed for a significant buildup up of elastic strain energy, which culminated in the recent period of rapid strain release. We now broaden the discussion to consider potential causes of earthquake clustering on tectonically immature faults in general, those like the BRF with preexisting geologic and structural complexities that enhance overall fault strength and the capacity to accumulate stress, and thereby govern rupture behavior.\nWe hypothesize that conditions that promote a high failure threshold on immature, low-slip-rate faults (e.g., high frictional or cohesive strength, structural and geometrical complexity, stress heterogeneity, and stress-field misalignment) also limit the length scale over which strain release can be accommodated and thereby promote clustering as a means to relieve accumulated and redistributed strain in the surrounding crust. Limits on rupture length are most apparent for relatively short, isolated faults like the Bear River that undergo end-to-end ruptures. Clustering may be also facilitated if the initial earthquake following a long quiescence causes a decrease in mechanical strength, as this would allow the fault to tap remaining elastic strain energy at lower levels of shear stress. Finite-element modeling of plate-interior earthquakes has shown that fault weakening following initial rupture can give rise to clusters of large events (Li et al., 2009). A fault that undergoes slow tectonic loading may in principle gain cohesive strength and heal more quickly than it is reloaded (Muhuri et al., 2003; Tenthorey and Cox, 2006; Weiss et al., 2016), setting the stage for the next cycle of gradual strain accrual and rapid release. The apparently higher stress drop of earthquakes on immature faults has been attributed to this time-dependent strengthening and to greater intrinsic fault strength (e.g., Scholz et al., 1986; Manighetti et al., 2007; Hecker et al., 2010). A potentially important factor is cyclical changes in pore-fluid pressure, which affects fault strength in a manner that counters increasing cohesive strength and may contribute to fluctuations in earthquake recurrence (Sibson, 1992). Lyakhovsky et al. (2001) and Hillers et al. (2009) demonstrated through numerical modeling that the interplay between weakening by earthquakes and healing during interseismic periods can, by affecting the evolution of damage rheology or fault friction, lead to complex patterns of strain release. Also, changes in stress caused by postseismic relaxation of the nonseismogenic lithosphere and transfer of stress to the seismogenic fault (Kenner and Simons, 2005; DiCaprio et al., 2008) and other fault-stress fluctuations involving a compliant lithosphere (Ch\u00e9ry and Vernant, 2006) have been proposed to result in clustering behavior and large variations in slip rate on faults in low-strain-rate environments.\n\n\n5.3\nRegional clustering: the role of fault interaction\nAs introduced earlier, the first two surface-rupturing events on the BRF occurred as part of a regionwide mid- to late Holocene cluster of strain release in the Middle Rocky Mountains (Fig. 10). This suggests a causal relation\u2014 broadly synchronous activation of widely spaced, low-slip-rate faults points to interrelated fault activity, perhaps signifying a regionwide perturbation of the stress field. Historical sequences of earthquakes have been successfully explained by invoking stress redistribution via coseismic static stress changes, postseismic viscoelastic relaxation, or dynamic stress from the passage of seismic waves (e.g., Freed, 2005, and references therein). Coulomb stress transfer could conceivably have contributed to the close timing of earthquakes on the BRF and the along-strike Rock Creek fault, its nearest neighbor involved in the cluster. Although the 70-km distance between the two faults (Fig. 1b) is greater than for well-known historical examples of earthquake triggering (e.g., Landers-Hector Mine and Dixie Valley-Fairview Peak sequences), it is within the range where stress transfer through the long-term effects of postseismic relaxation is expected to cause earthquake interaction (Ch\u00e9ry et al., 2001b), and, for normal-faulting earthquakes, cause positive stress change on receiver faults in the along-strike direction of the source fault (Nostro et al., 2001; Bagge and Hampel, 2017).\n\nScholz (2010) noted that because the magnitude of Coulomb stress transfer is small compared to earthquake stress drop, this implies that faults involved in a cluster are simultaneously close to failure. Citing several examples of earthquake clusters on intraplate faults, Scholz argued that mechanical synchronization drives loose coordination of earthquake timing among networks of similar-slip-rate faults. Benedetti et al. (2013) documented evidence of paleoearthquake synchrony among immature low-slip-rate normal faults in the Fucino fault system of central Italy, along with temporal clustering on individual faults. Rocky Mountains faults are more widely spaced than those in the Fucino system (which are <~10\u00a0km apart) and thus presumably subject to weaker interaction; however, both regions exhibit broadly similar patterns of strain release. It is noteworthy that the BRF appears to have been \u201cborn synchronized\u201d with its neighbors and that evidently prior to the recent episode of regional clustering had not been susceptible to being triggered by regional redistributions or pulses of stress.\n\n\n5.4\nImplications for mid-continental faulting and beyond\nThe striking behavior of the BRF, a sudden burst of seismic activity on a newly emergent fault, resembles more the behavior of faults in continental interiors than it does faults within a deforming plate margin (e.g., Crone et al., 2003; Holbrook et al., 2006; Calais et al., 2016; Liu and Stein, 2016). Emblematic of this, the BRF lies along the boundary between diffuse plate deformation to the west and the relatively stable mid-continent (e.g., Petersen et al., 2016). We suspect that conditions that promote earthquake clustering on the BRF, and on other immature faults as outlined above, may apply as well to faults in the thicker, stronger (although heterogeneous) lithosphere of the North American plate interior. Studies of what triggers activation (in single or repeated events) of quiescent, presumably critically stressed faults in cratonic settings invoke changes in fault strength or changes in stress arising from fault interaction or nontectonic processes such as glacial isostatic adjustment and erosional unloading (e.g., Liu and Stein, 2016, and references therein). The case of the BRF highlights the potential significance of inherited structural discontinuities in determining the yield strength of faults and supports the view that earthquake clustering may release a long-term buildup of strain (e.g., Craig et al., 2016) and be facilitated by temporal variations in fault strength. It also provides another instance in which apparent fault interaction engages slow-slipping faults in regional clusters of events. A better understanding of how these factors affect cycles of strain accumulation and release is important for advancing beyond simple stress-renewal models, with the promise of leading to more realistic assessments of seismic hazard.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe Bear River fault zone (BRF), an emergent normal fault in the slowly extending Rocky Mountain region east of the Basin and Range Province, provides an example of the effect of complex preexisting structure and rock-strength heterogeneity on strain-release behavior. Geomorphic and paleoseismic observations indicate that the BRF became a source of large-magnitude earthquakes only 4.5\u00a0ka, when it hosted the first of three (or possibly four) surface-rupturing events. The initial two earthquakes of the cluster, which were separated by only ~1\u00a0k.y., ruptured most or all of the 44-km length of the fault and had a wide zone of complex surface breaks that produced locally large (>5-m-high) scarps. The length of rupture and average net displacement, estimated to be >2\u00a0m per event, suggest these earthquakes were comparable in size to the 1959\u00a0M 7.3 Hebgen Lake, Montana earthquake. The most recent earthquake on the BRF is inferred to have occurred during the century prior to the beginning of the historical record ca. 1842 CE and appears to have had a shorter-length rupture and smaller displacements than the preceding events.\nWe hypothesize that the late and energetic emergence of the BRF is a consequence of mechanical buttressing of the fault at its south end against and beneath the south-dipping north flank of the Uinta arch, a basement-cored uplift oriented at a high angle to the BRF. This structural configuration, coupled with the mass of the Uinta Mountains, may have created a high failure threshold that allowed buildup of substantial elastic strain energy that culminated in the recent period of rapid strain release. The impact of the Uinta arch on BRF rupture can be seen in the highly complex pattern of surface rupture and kinematic disruption at the south end of the fault, where large-displacement secondary strands are aligned along the NE-striking North Flank thrust and deformation zone and the main surface trace of the BRF abruptly terminates. A major N-striking antithetic fault, the Lily Lake strand, crosscuts this structural grain and continues southward for several kilometers into the Uinta arch as a zone of discontinuous scarps, apparently becoming the master fault in this area. The first two earthquakes on the BRF belong to a previously identified regional cluster of mid- to late Holocene earthquakes in the Middle Rocky Mountains and correspond in time to a pair of earthquakes on the Rock Creek fault, 70\u00a0km distant but the closest to the BRF. This cluster of earthquake activity suggests that long-range stress transfer, combined with mechanical synchronization, causes coordinated strain release among widely spaced faults in the Rocky Mountain region.\nWe infer from our study of the BRF that the temporal clustering of earthquakes commonly observed on tectonically immature, low-slip-rate faults may arise at least in part from inherited geologic and structural complexities that enhance fault strength and capacity to withstand stress. We further postulate that these same complexities act to limit the length of ruptures and, combined with fault weakening following an initial event, promote earthquake clustering as a means of releasing accumulated elastic strain. We conjecture that these physical factors may operate as well in the relatively strong lithosphere of the mid-continent east of the BRF, where the evolution of strain and its seismic release is less well understood than in deforming plate-boundary regions.\n\n","244":"","245":"","246":"","247":"","248":"","249":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSubstantial improvement in the techniques of acquisition and analysis of seismological data, achieved in the last decades, provides unprecedented, detailed reconstructions of the active fault systems at seismogenic depths. High resolution in the detection and location of earthquake catalogues allows the location, dimension and attitude (strike, dip, length and width) of single fault segments to be defined. Outstanding examples come from the extensional fault systems in Central Italy, where seismological and geodetic networks have given progressively improved images of the faults activated during the Umbria-Marche (1997\u20131998, Chiaraluce et al., 2003), L'Aquila 2009 (Valoroso et al., 2013) and Central Italy (2016\u20132017, Chiaraluce et al., 2017; Improta et al., 2019; Michele et al., 2020) sequences. These reconstructions were based mainly on aftershock distributions, derived from the application and integration of both relative (e.g. double difference; Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000) and absolute (non-linear algorithm; Lomax et al., 2000) locations techniques.\nUnfortunately, there has been little corresponding improvement in the understanding of the subsurface geology in the same region. There are high-quality, detailed geological maps (Centamore et al., 1992; Koopman, 1983; Pierantoni et al., 2013; Carta Geologica Regionale 1:10000 \u2013 Regione Marche, 2014; Carta Geologica Regionale 1:10000 \u2013 Regione Umbria, 2016; Ghisetti and Vezzani, 1986), but the connection between the Quaternary faults exposed at the surface and the active faults at seismogenic depths (6\u201310\u00a0km in this region) is difficult to determine, and would require the availability of specifically aimed geophysical surveys. In this region, however, no large scale geophysical acquisition and\/or borehole drilling for scientific purposes has been undertaken for many years, and the most relevant information is provided by an irregular network of seismic reflection profiles, acquired by oil companies in the 1980's (e.g. Bally et al., 1986).\nIn Central Italy, the seismicity is related to a system of normal faults related to horizontal WSW-ENE extension, at a rate of 3\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr derived from geodetic data at a regional scale (e.g., Pondrelli et al., 2006; D'Agostino et al., 2011; Anderlini et al., 2016; Devoti et al., 2017). In the last 20\u00a0years, a huge amount of seismological and seismotectonic studies have been performed in this region. However, the actual geometry of the seismogenic faults (e.g. listric vs. planar), the nature of the rocks involved in the deformation and how they may influence the mechanical behaviour of the active faults, and the role of the pre-existing\/inherited structures (e.g. in fostering reactivation phenomena and\/or promoting segmentation of the activated fault systems) are still issues of much debate and disagreement.\nIn 2016\u20132017, a damaging seismic sequence affected a wide portion of Central Italy (Fig. 1\n), from Visso to Campotosto (e.g. Tinti et al., 2016; Chiaraluce et al., 2017), activating an 80-km long system of SW-dipping normal fault segments, along which spectacular co-seismic ruptures were observed. The structures involved, are part of a longer alignment of seismogenic faults, responsible of the main seismic sequences, which have affected the region for the last 40\u00a0years (e.g. Boncio et al., 2004; Barchi and Mirabella, 2009). They are also responsible for significant historical seismicity (Rovida et al., 2020). Hundreds of thousands of earthquakes were registered during the 2016\u20132017 sequence (e.g. Chiaraluce et al., 2017; Improta et al., 2019), including 9 events with Mw\u00a0>\u00a05 (Fig. 1b). The sequence started on August 24, 2016 with the Mw 6.0 Amatrice earthquake, close to the town of Accumoli (Michele et al., 2016; Tinti et al., 2016), causing intense ground shaking and a cm-scale surface rupture along the M. Vettore normal fault trace (Pucci et al., 2017). Following two months of continuous aftershock activity, on October 26, the Mw 5.9 Visso earthquake occurred at the north-western edge of the aftershock area. Four days later (October 30), the strongest event of the sequence with Mw 6.5 occurred close to Norcia, halfway between the towns of Amatrice and Visso. Finally, on January 18, 2017, a series of four additional moderate magnitude (5.0\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a05.5) extensional earthquakes, hit the Campotosto area, in the southernmost part of the affected region (Fig. 1b).\nThis paper is aimed at providing a new, comprehensive reconstruction of the subsurface structure of the entire area affected by the 2016\u20132017 seismic sequence, as constrained by previously unreleased deep seismic data seismic profiles, giving insights into the influence of the subsurface geology (i.e. lithology and structure) on the geometry and seismicity patterns associated with the faults. The reconstruction is based on a set of five geological cross-sections, extrapolated down to a depth of about 12\u00a0km, oriented ca. N65\u00b0, orthogonal to the strike of the causative faults of the earthquakes. The sections are based on the integration of surface geological data, mostly derived from published maps (mainly Koopman, 1983; Centamore et al., 1992; Pierantoni et al., 2013) and seismic reflection profiles, acquired for oil exploration purposes in the late twentieth century (some of which are shown by Porreca et al., 2018). Earthquake foci are derived from a re-localized data-set (from Michele et al., 2020) and focal mechanisms come from INGV TDMT (web-service: http:\/\/cnt.rm.ingv.it\/tdmt;\nScognamiglio et al., 2009). Seismicity has been plotted along the cross sections so that the relationship between the geological and seismological faults (sensu Chiaraluce et al., 2005) can be assessed and discussed.\n\n\n2\nRegional framework and surface geological structures\nThe area associated with the 2016\u20132017 seismic sequence is located in a tectonically complex region, where three major structural domains interact (Fig. 1a), whose stratigraphy is schematically represented in Fig. 2\n:\n\n\u2212\nthe Umbria-Marche Domain, i.e. the SE part of the Umbria-Marche fold-and-thrust belt (e.g. Barchi et al., 2001), involving a Mesozoic-Paleogene multilayer sequence of carbonate rocks (Umbria-Marche succession, e.g. Cresta et al., 1989; Centamore et al., 1992; Menichetti and Coccioni, 2013);\n\n\n\u2212\nthe Gran Sasso Domain, representing the transition between the Umbria-Marche pelagic basinal area and the southernmost Latium-Abruzzi Platform, which is the source of the abundant calcareous turbidites, intercalated in the Mesozoic-Paleogene multilayer sequence (Ghisetti and Vezzani, 1991; Cardello and Doglioni, 2015);\n\n\n\u2212\nthe Laga Foredeep Domain, where Late Miocene syn-orogenic siliciclastic deposits extensively crop out (Flysch della Laga Fm.; Centamore et al., 1992), covering the Umbria-Marche succession.\n\n\n\nThe structural evolution of this region is characterised by a Late Miocene-Early Pliocene compressional phase, followed by Late Pliocene\u2013Quaternary extension (e.g., Ghisetti et al., 1993; Pauselli et al., 2006; Barchi, 2010; Cosentino et al., 2010; Beaudoin et al., 2020). The compressional structures show a very complex pattern (Fig. 1a). Both Umbria-Marche and Gran Sasso domains overthrust the Laga Foredeep Domain via major arcuate reverse faults: the Monti Sibillini (hereinafter MSt, Koopman, 1983; Lavecchia, 1985; Cooper and Burbi, 1986; Mazzoli et al., 2005) and Gran Sasso thrusts (e.g. Ghisetti and Vezzani, 1991), with eastward and northward convexity, respectively (Fig. 1a). The fold axes associated to these thrust systems mainly trend N-S in the Umbria-Marche and Laga Foredeep Domains, and WNW-ESE in the Gran Sasso Domain. At regional scales, the subsequent (mainly Quaternary) normal faults crosscut this complex assemblage of compressional structures, maintaining a regular, NNW-SSE alignment, across the whole study area. A set of intermountain basins (Fig. 1a; Barchi et al., 2000; Boncio et al., 2004), is generated in the subsiding hangingwalls of the faults (Calamita et al., 1992; Blumetti et al., 1993; Vignaroli et al., 2019), infilled by continental sediments of Quaternary and possibly late Pliocene (e.g. Cosentino et al., 2017) age.\nFive geological cross-sections have been constructed across the study area (Fig. 3\n), oriented orthogonally to the strike of the major active normal fault systems (i.e. N65\u00b0), as expressed by the focal mechanisms of the mainshocks (Mw\u00a0>\u00a05) during the sequence and by the attitude of the major Quaternary normal faults exposed at the surface (Fig. 1).\nSection S01 (Fig. 3a) crosses the NW termination of the Cupi-Ussita Fault (Brozzetti et al., 2019), the northernmost segment activated during the sequence. The section also crosses the southernmost fault segments (Mt. Cavallo-Mt. Fema fault segments, Chiaraluce et al., 2005) activated during the 1997\u20131998 Umbria-Marche sequence (Sellano earthquake, Mw\u00a0=\u00a05.5, 14th October 1997, e.g. Chiaraluce et al., 2003). Sections S02, S03, S04 and S05 pass through the hypocentres of four major events of the Amatrice-Visso-Norcia 2016\u20132017 sequence. Section S02 (Fig. 3b) crosses the Mt. Bove Fault, close to the 26th October 2016 (Mw\u00a0=\u00a05.9) hypocentre. Section S03 (Fig. 3c) crosses the M. Vettore Fault, close to the 30th October 2016 MW\u00a0=\u00a06.5 hypocentre. Section S04 (Fig. 3d) crosses the 24th August 2016 (Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.0) hypocentre that occurred in the area corresponding to the transfer zone between the SE termination of the M. Vettore Fault and the NW termination of the M. Gorzano Fault (see map in Fig. 1a). Section S05 (Fig. 3e) crosses the Campotosto Fault, i.e. the last and southernmost segment of the system, activated on the 18th of January 2017 by 4 events with 5.0\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a05.5. About 10\u00a0km west of the Campotosto Fault, the S05 section also crosses the Montereale Fault, another Quaternary structure which is believed to be active and seismogenic (Civico et al., 2016; Cinti et al., 2018).\nThe major compressional and extensional structures of the study area are described in the following sections, based on the authors' extensive geological knowledge of the region derived from fieldwork, as well as on previously published geological maps (e.g. Centamore et al., 1992; Pierantoni et al., 2013; Testa et al., 2019; Stendardi et al., 2020).\n\n2.1\nCompressional structures\nIn the Umbria-Marche Domain, the Umbria-Marche succession extensively crops out in the hangingwall of the MSt, forming a complex pattern of box shaped E-verging folds and arcuate thrusts (Fig. 1a). The overall shortening direction is ca. E-W (N80\u00b0E), as evidenced by the N-S trending fold axes and by the kinematic indicators on the major thrust faults (e.g. Lavecchia, 1985; Barchi, 1991). The sections S01, S02 and S03 (Fig. 3a,b,c) illustrate the structural style of these compressional structures, which correspond to the \u2018Umbria-Marche folds\u2019 (Massoli et al., 2006), detached within the Triassic evaporites (Burano Fm.; Martinis and Pieri, 1964) and involving the whole carbonatic succession, with a typical wavelength of 4\u20136\u00a0km (Massoli et al., 2006).\nIn the Laga Foredeep Domain, the Messinian Laga turbidites extensively crop out, with a maximum thickness exceeding 3\u00a0km in the major synclines. The underlying Umbria-Marche succession is involved in a series of 3 major N-S trending anticlines, generated in the hangingwall of W-dipping major thrusts, from W to E: Sarnano-Cittareale, Acquasanta-Gorzano and Montagna dei Fiori-Montagnone Anticlines (Fig. 1a). As also observed by Massoli et al. (2006) in other areas where the Umbria-Marche succession is covered by thick turbidites successions, these folds involving the carbonates are here spaced at a much larger wavelength (10\u201315\u00a0km) than in the Umbria-Marche Domain (Sections S04 and S05, Fig. 3d,e). The Laga turbidites are generally detached from the underlying Umbria-Marche succession by the Laga Detachment Zone (sensu Koopman, 1983), generating low-wavelength folds and imbricates, also imaged in the sections S03, S04 and S05 (Fig. 3c,d,e).\nIn the southern part of the study area, the WNW-ESE trending Gran Sasso thrust (e.g. Ghisetti and Vezzani, 1991; Cardello and Doglioni, 2015) marks the boundary between the Laga Foredeep and Gran Sasso domains (Fig. 1a). South of the structurally complex zone, where the western termination of the Gran Sasso thrust meets the MSt, the latter assumes the characteristics of a major transpressive fault (Olevano-Antrodoco tectonic Line, e.g. Salvini and Vittori, 1982).\n\n\n2.2\nExtensional structures\nIn the Central Apennines, Quaternary extension is accommodated by a composite pattern of NNW-SSE trending, mostly WSW-dipping, seismogenic normal faults (Fig. 1; e.g. Barchi et al., 2000; Boncio et al., 2004). Since the Late Pliocene\u2013Early Pleistocene, displacement along these extensional faults have led to the formation of a series of narrow continental basins (Calamita et al., 1994; Cavinato and De Celles, 1999; Lavecchia et al., 1994, 2002; Cosentino et al., 2017). The basins located in the study area are: the Cascia, Norcia and Castelluccio di Norcia basins (Calamita et al., 1982; Blumetti et al., 1993; Brozzetti and Lavecchia, 1994; Coltorti and Farabollini, 1995), in the Umbria-Marche Domain; and the Amatrice (Vignaroli et al., 2019) and Montereale (Chiarini et al., 2014) basins in the Laga Foredeep Domain (Fig. 1a).\nThe main seismogenic normal faults in the study area, are arranged into two main sub-parallel alignments, separated across strike by a distance of about 10\u00a0km (Fig. 1). The western, longer alignment (~ 200\u00a0km long) affects the whole Umbria region from Citt\u00e0 di Castello to Norcia, extending southward to Montereale and L'Aquila (e.g. Barchi et al., 2000; Boncio et al., 2004). This system includes the main normal faults responsible for the Mw 5.8 Norcia 1979 (Deschamps et al., 1984), the Mw 5.4 Gubbio 1984 (Valensise and Pantosti, 2001), the Mw 6.0 Colfiorito 1997 (Chiaraluce et al., 2003), and the Mw 6.1\u00a0L'Aquila 2009 (Valoroso et al., 2013) earthquakes. In this study, we mostly focus on the eastern alignment, activated during the 2016\u20132017 seismic sequence, which consists of two major sets of active faults (Fig. 1a): the M. Vettore-M. Bove Fault System (VBFS), including the Cupi-Ussita (CUF), M. Bove (BF) and M. Vettore (VF) fault segments; and the Laga Fault System (LFS), including the M. Gorzano (GF) and the Campotosto (CF) fault segments. It is worth noting that different interpretations of the LFS segmentation have been proposed in previous studies (Boncio et al., 2004; Falcucci et al., 2018). At the surface, the boundary between the VBFS and LFS grossly corresponds to the MSt, even though detailed geological mapping showed that the M. Vettore Fault displaces the MSt, propagating few km across the Laga Foredeep Domain (Porreca et al., 2020; Stendardi et al., 2020 and references therein). The geomorphological expression of the active normal faults is much more evident in areas where carbonate rocks crop out (e.g. Umbria-Marche Domain), compared to areas where the bedrock consists of turbidite sandstones and marls (e.g. Laga Foredeep Domain).\nThe seismogenic activity of these faults is demonstrated, beyond the evident spatial connection with the instrumental seismicity distribution (e.g. Chiaraluce et al., 2005), by the historical seismicity (summarised in the national catalogues by Rovida et al., 2016, 2020) and by several paleo-seismological studies (e.g. Galli et al., 2008, 2017; Cinti et al., 2011). Such data also demonstrate the seismogenic activity of other nearby fault segments, like Cascia and M. Alvagnano faults (Blumetti and Guerrieri, 2007; Galli et al., 2020) and Montereale fault (Chiarini et al., 2014; Civico et al., 2016; Cinti et al., 2018).\nThe position and associated net displacement of the major normal faults affecting the study area are also represented along the five geological sections of Fig. 3, and the position of the surface ruptures, mapped after the 2016\u20132017 seismic sequence are also shown (Ferrario and Livio, 2018; Villani et al., 2018, 2018a; Brozzetti et al., 2019; Galli et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n3\nSeismic reflection data\nThe geological reconstructions proposed in this paper are based on a wide date-set of about 100 2-D seismic data seismic reflection profiles, acquired in the study area in the last decades of the 20th century (1970\u20131998) for oil exploration purposes (Fig. 4a). Most of these lines, never published before, were kindly provided by the Italian oil company (ENI S.p.A.), whilst others were extracted from the public database \u201cVisibility of petroleum exploration data in Italy\u201d (Videpi Project, www.videpi.com). From the same sources, we extracted the stratigraphy of 4 deep boreholes (Varoni1, Campotosto1, Antrodoco1 and Amandola1, see locations in Fig. 3a), drilled in the study area. A more complete description of the data-set, including details of the acquisition and processing techniques, was provided in Porreca et al. (2018). Despite the quite irregular spatial distribution of the seismic profiles and their variable resolution, these data provide unique images of some representative structures, giving relevant insights into the geological setting at depth and the structural style of both compressional and extensional features.\n\n3.1\nSeismic stratigraphy\nThe definition of a coherent, easily applicable seismic stratigraphy is an essential, preliminary step for any seismic interpretation procedure. Following on from previous seismic reflection studies performed in Central Italy (e.g., Bally et al., 1986; Barchi et al., 1998; Bigi et al., 2011; Mirabella et al., 2008, 2011), four main seismo-stratigraphic units are defined here in the study area (Fig. 4b), characterised by distinctive seismic facies and calibrated using the few available deep boreholes. The units are described as follow, from top to bottom.\nThe uppermost unit (\u2018Turbidites\u2019) includes the Miocene Flysch (MF) of the Messinian Laga Fm. (e.g. Centamore et al., 1992) and the underlying Early Tertiary Marly Group, (Koopman, 1983; Cooper and Burbi, 1986). In the nearly undeformed sections (e.g. in syncline hinge zones), the Laga Fm. sandstones are characterised by a regular set of high-frequency reflectors, with good lateral continuity, overlaying the nearly transparent facies of the Tertiary Marly Group (Fig. 4c). In most profiles, however, the seismic facies of the Turbidites is more chaotic, reflecting their intense folding and fracturing.\nThe second unit (\u2018Carbonates\u2019) corresponds to the Mesozoic-Paleogene Umbria-Marche succession (UC, Fig. 4b), including the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene Carbonates (Scaglia Group and the underlying Early Cretaceous Carbonates, Fig. 2) and the Jurassic Carbonates. It is characterised by an overall transparent seismic facies, with two major high amplitude and continuous reflections in the upper part, corresponding to the top of the Scaglia Group (Top UC, Fig. 4b) and to the mid-Cretaceous marly horizon of Marne a Fucoidi Fm. (Top FUC, Fig. 4b); other reflectors are locally present in the central part of the unit (Fig. 4b, d).\nThe third unit (\u2018Evaporites\u2019), mainly corresponding to the Late Triassic Anidriti di Burano Fm. (Martinis and Pieri, 1964), is generally characterised by transparent seismic facies, often topped by a major reflector (Top TE, Fig. 4b), possibly corresponding to a relatively thin horizon of layered dolomitised limestones and marls (Calcari e Marne a Rhaetavicula Contorta Fm., Ciarapica, 2007).\nThe deepest unit, the underlying \u2018Basement\u2019 never crops out in this region and is drilled by few deep boreholes, scattered across the Italian peninsula (see e.g. Patacca et al., 2008). The uppermost part of the Basement consists of sedimentary or low-grade metamorphosed clastic successions of Late Palaeozoic-Middle Triassic age (phyllites), and is characterised by a set of oblique, medium to high amplitude, low-continuity reflections, contrasting with the overlying transparent facies of the Evaporites. These peculiar seismic facies have been referred to previously as the \u2018acoustic basement\u2019 (Bally et al., 1986; Barchi et al., 1998; Mirabella et al., 2008).\nThe VP interval velocities reported in Fig. 4b, used for the depth conversion of the seismic profiles interpreted in this study, are derived from well data, collected by the numerous previous studies performed in this region (Bally et al., 1986; Barchi et al., 1998; Bigi et al., 2011; Latorre et al., 2016). This regional data-base of the available velocity data was recently summarised and improved by Montone and Mariucci (2020).\n\n\n3.2\nDescription of the seismic profiles\nThe examples illustrated in the present paper consists of five seismic reflection profiles, here named SAR01, NOR01, NOR02, NOR03 and GOR01 (see traces in Fig. 4a).\nThe original seismic reflection profiles (Porreca et al., 2018) have been improved in their quality and interpretability using a workflow combining data-preconditioning and attribute analysis (Chopra and Marfurt, 2007; Marfurt, 2018). This technique is a relatively cheap and fast strategy to qualitatively emphasize data properties and geophysical features in conventional seismic reflection datasets. An extensive overview and discussion on these techniques can be found in Ercoli et al. (2020).\nIn the present work, we have experimented using structure-oriented filters (i.e. dip-steering median filter) as a pre-conditioning strategy before computing the pseudo-relief attribute (Ercoli et al., 2020 and references therein). This process enhances laterally continuous events reducing the random noise, but without suppressing details of reflection events consistent with the structures. Our workflow had a fruitful effect on our seismic data, cleaning up the random noise characterizing the original seismic lines, better focusing the key reflected horizons. A good example of the substantial benefits gained by the application of this technique is observable in the line SAR01 in Fig. 5a, where despite the original low quality, contains sets of reflections have been positively enhanced allowing the key geological structures to be mapped. Thanks to this approach and following improvements, we propose some novel interpretations, including seismic profiles (e.g. NOR01, NOR02 and NOR03) already described and discussed by Porreca et al. (2018) and Ercoli et al. (2020).\n\nThe seismic profile SAR01 (Fig. 5a) crosses the Sarnano area, in the footwall of the MSt, and extends ENE-ward (ca. N75\u00b0) across the Laga basin (Figs. 1 and 4a). In the shallower part of the profile, the east-dipping forelimb of a major anticline involving the Carbonates, is clearly imaged (Sarnano anticline, Cooper and Burbi, 1986, see map in Fig. 1), overthrusting a thick (about 2\u00a0s TWT), nearly undeformed siliciclastic succession. In the thrust hangingwall, the internal reflection of the Turbidites are strongly deformed and totally detached from their original substrate, forming a triangle zone between a W-dipping out-of syncline thrust and an E-dipping forelimb back-thrust. In the deeper portion of the profile, a second unit of Carbonates can be recognized beneath the Sarnano anticline, connected towards the east to the exposed bedrock of the Laga succession. Beneath the Carbonates and the Evaporites, between 3 and 4\u00a0s TWT, reflective seismic facies are interpreted to represent the acoustic basement. In the central part of the profile, a major, gently W-dipping reflection obliquely dissects the stratigraphic markers of the Carbonates at a depth of about 3\u00a0s twt: this reflection was interpreted as a major thrust, producing the observed tectonic duplication of the Carbonates.\n\nThe E-W trending seismic profile NOR03 (Fig. 5b) crosses the Acquasanta anticline just 2\u00a0km north of Acquasanta village (Figs. 1 and 4a), providing another well resolved image of the subsurface structures of the Laga Foredeep Domain. The Acquasanta anticline, involving the Carbonates and the underlying Evaporites, is here imaged as a large asymmetric, east-verging box-fold. It shows a long, gently W-dipping back-limb and a relatively flat crestal zone, separated by a steep, E-dipping back-thrust. The short forelimb is poorly imaged, presumably because its strata are very steep or even overturned. A set of short-wavelength folds and imbricated thrusts, with a marked eastward tectonic vergence, involve the Turbidites on top of gently W-dipping Carbonates of the Acquasanta anticline back-limb. The overall geometry of the anticline, as imaged by the Carbonate reflectors, is quite similar to that of the widely described major anticlines exposed in the Umbria-Marche Domain (e.g. Calamita and Deiana, 1988; Lavecchia et al., 1988; Calamita et al., 1994; Tavarnelli, 1997; Mazzoli et al., 2005; Calamita et al., 2012). The anticline is generated at the hangingwall of a major W-dipping fore-thrust, with a staircase trajectory, suggesting a fault-bend-fold mechanism (e.g. Calamita et al., 2012), with a basal decollement located within the Evaporites. At the footwall of the thrust, beneath the crest zone of the box fold, the seismic profile shows a set of gently E-dipping reflections, down to at least 2.5\u00a0s (TWT), affecting a deeper Carbonate Unit. Within this unit, the reflectors are displaced by a set of W-dipping normal faults, apparently pre-dating the emplacement of the thrust.\n\nThe NOR01 and NOR02 seismic profiles (Fig. 6\n) extend in an E-W direction along the westward continuation of the profile NOR03, crossing the Quaternary basins of Norcia (Nb) and Castelluccio di Norcia (CNb) and the faults bordering them, as shown in the pseudo-3D view of Fig. 6a.\nThe profiles (Fig. 6b, c) offer a view of the conjugate high-angle normal fault systems bordering the Quaternary basins, imaged as steep alignments of disrupted reflectors, that clearly corresponds to the position of the faults mapped at the surface (see e.g. Brozzetti and Lavecchia, 1994 for Nb and Pierantoni et al., 2013 for CNb). The eastern part of profile NOR01 (Fig. 6b) images the master faults bordering the flanks of the asymmetric Nb, i.e.: the SW-dipping Norcia Fault, bordering its eastern flank and its major, antithetic (i.e. NE-dipping) splay, bordering the western flank. The Norcia Fault is also visible in the NOR02 profile (Fig. 6c), whose central portion images the main faults, bordering the CNb. The master fault is here represented by the SW-dipping M. Vettore Fault, reactivated during the 2016 earthquake (e.g. Villani et al., 2019), whilst the main NE-dipping, antithetic normal fault, joins onto the M. Vettore Fault at about 2\u20133\u00a0s. A further, major antithetic blind fault can be traced west of CNb, which was proposed to be responsible for a large aftershock (Mw 5.4) that occurred few hours after the 24th August Amatrice main shock (Chiaraluce et al., 2017; Porreca et al., 2018; Improta et al., 2019).\nFor both Nb and CNb, the seismic volume between the two, opposite dipping, conjugated normal faults, shows a peculiar reflection fabric, dominated by high-angle discontinuities (Fig. 6b, c). This is interpreted to represent penetrative systems of minor, synthetic and antithetic splays (Ercoli et al., 2020), in good correspondence with the complex pattern of Quaternary faults mapped at the surface (e.g. Pierantoni et al., 2013), as well as with the dense network of co-seismic ruptures that occurred in this area (distributed deformation, sensu Ferrario and Livio, 2018). Several minor fault splays, affecting the bedrock and deposits of the CNb, were also revealed by near-surface geophysical surveys, performed before and after the occurrence of the seismic sequence (e.g. Ercoli et al., 2013, 2014; Villani et al., 2019).\nIn the deeper parts of both sections, at around 3\u00a0s twt, a prominent reflection has been recognized (Fig. 6b, c), particularly evident along the NOR02 profile, beneath CNb, where it has been previously interpreted (Porreca et al., 2018; Ercoli et al., 2020) as corresponding to the top of the acoustic basement. The continuity of the top basement is abruptly interrupted in its western edge, where two different tectonic structures converge: a low-angle west-dipping discontinuity, corresponding to the Sarnano thrust, which upward cuts the Carbonates reflectors of the back-limb of the Acquasanta Anticline; and a steeper discontinuity, following the trajectory of the M. Vettore Fault at depth. The crosscutting relationships between these two discontinuities are ambiguous and discussed in detailed by Ercoli et al. (2020).\n\nThe GOR01 seismic profile (Fig. 7\n) is not part of our data-set, but is derived from the paper by Bigi et al. (2013). Here we propose a new interpretation of this profile, that differs from that offered by Bigi et al. (2011, 2013). Bigi et al. (2013), Fig. 3b) propose that the active Campotosto fault (i.e. the southern segment of the Laga Fault System, Fig. 1a), exposed at the surface, is detached at a relatively shallow depth (about 4\u00a0km) and is not connected to the source of the earthquakes at depth. Consequently, the authors interpret its present-day activity as a \u201csympathetic reactivation induced by the motion of the deeper, seismogenic normal fault\u201d. This interpretation is compatible with the seismic signals, and explains the lack of shallow aftershocks. In our alternative interpretation (Fig. 7), the Campotosto Fault propagates downward to seismogenic depth, following the perfect alignment between the normal fault trace, exposed at the surface, and the deep seismicity, registered during both 2009 (e.g. Valoroso et al., 2013) and 2016\u201317 (e.g. Michele et al., 2020) sequences. In this interpretation, the geometry of the Campotosto Fault is similar to that of the other seismogenic normal faults, activated during the 2016\u20132017 sequence.\nMoreover, we propose a new interpretation of the relationships between the M. Gorzano anticline and the Campotosto Fault, hypothesising that the anticline exposed at the surface in the footwall of the Campotosto Fault is a shallow structure, affecting only the detached Turbidites. This interpretation is based on the geology mapped at the surface (Centamore et al., 1992), showing that the N-S trending M. Gorzano anticline, involving the Carbonates, is actually displaced by the NNW-SSE trending Campotosto Fault (Fig. 1): south of the intersection point, the crest of this deeply-rooted anticline is downthrown in the hangingwall of the Campotosto Fault.\n\n\n3.3\nSummary\nThe available seismic profiles provide significant insights onto the structural style of both compressional and extensional structures.\nThe compressional structures are dominated by a consistent style of deformation, characterised by multiple d\u00e9collements (Massoli et al., 2006). Two main d\u00e9collements are clearly imaged in the seismic profiles:\n\n\u2212\na shallower d\u00e9collement is located in the Tertiary Marly Group, above the top of the Carbonates (Laga Detachment Zone, sensu Koopman, 1983) and generates intense, short-wavelength, disharmonic folding and imbrication of the Turbidites (lines SAR01, NOR03, GOR01);\n\n\n\u2212\na deeper d\u00e9collement is located within the Evaporites, generating long-wavelength, box-shaped anticlines involving the Carbonates (e.g. Sarnano and Acquasanta Anticlines). These anticlines developed in the hangingwalls of shallow-dipping major thrusts, are characterised by significant amount of shortening (up to 10\u00a0km) and extensive duplication of the Carbonates (lines SAR01, NOR03).\n\n\n\nThe profiles also show that the top of the acoustic basement is not laterally continuous, suggesting that at least the uppermost part of the basement is deformed. Previous papers, based on seismic reflection profiles, show that the top basement steps downwards to the east due to thrusting (Sage et al., 1991; Barchi et al., 1998; Fantoni and Franciosi, 2010).\nThe extensional structures (i.e. the active normal faults) cross-cut the stacked units of the sedimentary cover, from the surface down to the top Basement (lines NOR01, NOR02, GOR01), where they may reactivate the steps generated by the major thrusts. The extensional systems usually consist of conjugate sets, driven by SW-dipping master faults (NOR01, NOR02).\n\n\n\n4\nIntegrated geological sections\nThe five geological sections, shown in Fig. 3, have been extrapolated down to ca. 12\u00a0km (Fig. 8\n), using the interpretation of the nearest available seismic reflection profiles and, more generally, the crucial indications offered by key-seismic profiles (see Chapter 3), in particular about the structural style at depth (e.g. thin vs. thick-skinned tectonics, Pfiffner, 2017; Poblet and Lisle, 2011) and the depth to basement.\nQuite different reconstructions have been published previously by different authors for this area, proposing a large range of possible solutions for both the structural style and for the amount of the associated shortening (e.g. Ghisetti et al., 1993; Calamita and Pizzi, 1994; Bigi et al., 1999, 2011; Scisciani et al., 2014). A review of the previous studies about the structural setting of the region at depth was recently offered by Porreca et al. (2018). For our cross sections, we adopted a consistent structural style extensively observed throughout the region, characterised by a system of multiple d\u00e9collements, where different sets of structures are generated at different structural levels, as described earlier.\nAlong our cross sections, the main compressional structures consist of four major stacked tectonic units, involving the Triassic-Paleogene Carbonates and Evaporites (Fig. 8a). Top to bottom (i.e. W to E), they are: the Umbria-Marche Unit (U1, at the hangingwall of the MSt), the Sarnano-Cittareale Unit (U2), the Acquasanta-Gorzano Unit (U3) and the Montagna dei Fiori-Montagnone Unit (U4). In the southernmost part of the study area, the Umbria-Marche Unit is replaced by the Gran Sasso Unit as the uppermost stacked unit U1. In the shallower and easternmost part of the sections, above the Carbonates, the Tertiary Turbidites are shortened by short-wavelength folds and imbricated thrusts, detached within the Tertiary Marly Group. In the deeper part of the sections, the uppermost part of the basement is stepped due to the presence of major thrusts, as also confirmed by 2D and 3D gravimetric modelling (Mancinelli et al., 2019, 2020). These steps are located beneath the main topographic\/structural culminations of the region, e.g. Monti Sibillini and Montagna dei Fiori. A similar structural style, with stacked carbonate units above a stepped basement, was also used by Fantoni and Franciosi (2010); see their Fig. 8), who drew a set of regional-scale geological sections through the external part of the whole Apennines belt, based on a vast data-set of industrial seismic profiles and deep boreholes.\nAs we already know from the description of the surface geology, the compressional structures are systematically cross-cut and displaced by the later (i.e. Quaternary) normal faults, responsible for the seismic activity of this region, whose position and attitude is very well known at the surface, where they have been mapped in detail by many authors (e.g. Pierantoni et al., 2013; Brozzetti et al., 2019); many are poorly imaged by the available seismic profiles, which yield only few insights into their extrapolation to depth (see e.g. Figs. 5 to 7).\n\n4.1\nSubsurface geology and seismicity distribution\nAlong the five sections (Fig. 8) we have plotted the 2016\u201317 seismicity, derived from the data-set published by Michele et al. (2020), consisting of all the ML\u00a0>\u00a01.5 earthquakes that occurred in the study region between August 2016 and October 2018. These ca. 34,000 events, relocated by applying double difference techniques (Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000), have a formal error smaller than 300\u00a0m in both horizontal and vertical direction, and can therefore be certainly compared to the geological features. As the 24th of August (Amatrice) event was the first shock of the sequence, it was recorded only at the permanent stations of the national network; the temporary stations, densifying the network, were added only in the coming days. Thus, this main event shows the largest uncertainties in the hypocentre parameters (Michele et al., 2020). For this reason, only for this major earthquake, we adopted a more recent solution, proposed by Waldhauser et al., 2020, locating the mainshock at about 6.5\u00a0km depth.\nFor each section, we selected the seismicity, occurring in a strip 6\u00a0km wide, \u00b1 3\u00a0km from each side of the traces reported in Fig. 1a; for the S05 section, a wider strip (8\u00a0km) was selected, in order to include all the four MW\u00a0>\u00a05 events that occurred in January 2018 (see map in Fig. 1). We also plotted the position and focal mechanism solutions of the main shocks (with Mw\u00a0>\u00a05.0). While comparing the seismicity distribution with the imaged geological structures (and evaluating reciprocal fit or misfit), it is important to keep in mind that the velocity model used for the depth conversion of the seismic profiles is not the same as that used for the localization of the earthquakes' foci, which is a 1-D gradient version of the P- and S-wave velocity model (after Carannante et al., 2013). Thus, we can regard these two sets of data as being completely independent.\nIn all the cross sections of Fig. 8, the seismicity is distributed within a rock volume about 10\u00a0km thick, oriented nearly parallel to the NNW-trending attitude of the main normal fault segments mapped at the surface and dipping about 45\u00b0 towards WSW. Within this volume, we divide the observed seismicity into four major groups based on location relative to actual or inferred geological structures:\n\n\u2212\n\nGroup 1 (Master Fault seismicity, MFs) is a strip, 1 to 2\u00a0km thick, grossly aligned along the trajectory of the activated main normal fault hosting the mainshock (e.g. focal mechanisms) and related aftershocks;\n\n\n\u2212\n\nGroup 2 (Hangingwall seismicity, HWs) and Group 3 (Footwall seismicity, FWs) consist of the events located within the master fault hangingwall and footwall blocks, respectively, whose distribution and\/or clustering varies considerably through the different sections; and\n\n\n\u2212\n\nGroup 4 (Basal Fault zone, BFz) consists of the events located along a layer, about 2\u00a0km thick, corresponding to the bottom of the observed seismicity, and therefore here identified as a \u201cBasal Fault zone\u201d, BFz (the same alignment is termed \u201cShear Zone, SZ\u201d by Michele et al., 2020). In all the sections, the western part of the BFz is flat or gently east-dipping, whilst its eastern part dips eastward with a steeper trajectory (15\u00b0 to 25\u00b0).\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, we describe the seismicity distribution, and the characteristics of the four groups along the five geological sections, from N to S (Fig. 8).\nAlong Section S01 (Fig. 8b), the overall seismicity is distributed within a volume about 10\u00a0km thick, almost symmetrically with compared to the Cupi-Ussita fault, which is also imaged by the MFs alignment. In the western portion of the section, the 1997 aftershocks are aligned along the W-dipping Sellano fault (Chiaraluce et al., 2005), and at a distance of about 10\u00a0km from the almost perfectly parallel Cupi-Ussita Fault. Both HWs and FWs are well developed and consist of two shallow groups of earthquakes (D\u00a0<\u00a03\u00a0km), about 2\u00a0km thick, located in the hangingwall of the MSt. The seismicity of FWs is aligned at the base of the Pizzo Tre Vescovi thrust. The BFz consists of an almost flat, about 1.5\u00a0km thick layer of seismicity, whose bottom is located at a depth of about 9\u00a0km; towards the east, seismicity is much less abundant and dips eastward, about 20\u00b0.\nAlong Section 02 (Fig. 8c), the seismicity is distributed asymmetrically with respect to the M. Bove Fault, being more abundant in the footwall block, where it propagates to a distance of about 7\u00a0km from the master fault. MFs dips at a shallower angle compared to the SW-dipping nodal plane of the focal mechanism (46\u00b0). FWs contain a major, gently west-dipping, about 2\u00a0km thick cluster of seismicity, developed within the Umbria-Marche Unit (U1), i.e. in the hangingwall of the MSt. HWs consists of scarce and sparser seismicity, possibly clustering in correspondence of antithetic and minor synthetic splays of the M. Bove fault. Beneath the activated master fault, the BFz is a dense, gently E-dipping cluster, up to 2\u00a0km thick, whose bottom is located at a depth of about 8\u00a0km and evolves eastward into a relatively steep (about 22\u00b0) trajectory.\nAlong Section 03 (Fig. 8d), as in the previous section, the seismicity is asymmetrical with respect to the M. Vettore Fault, propagating prevalently in the footwall blocks, at distances up to 10\u00a0km from the master fault. Again, the MFs is aligned at a lower angle compared to the SW-dipping nodal plane of the focal mechanism (46\u00b0). Within the footwall block, seismicity is clustered at two different depths, being 1\u20134 and 6\u20138\u00a0km, respectively: the shallower, prominent cluster, resembles the occurrence of conjugate normal faults, affecting the Carbonates and the Evaporites of the Sarnano-Cittareale Unit (U2), at the footwall of the MSt; the deeper seismicity contains a group of minor clusters, mainly hosted in the evaporites of the underlying Acquasanta-Gorzano Unit (U3). HWs consists of scarce, poorly clustered events at a depth of 2\u20134\u00a0km, mainly in the hangingwall of the MSt, and of sparser seismicity, possibly clustering in correspondence of antithetic and minor synthetic splays of the master fault. The pattern of the BFz is quite similar to that of S02, with a dense, gently E-dipping cluster, up to 2\u00a0km thick, located at a depth of about 8\u00a0km beneath the M. Vettore Fault. The eastern part dips eastward about 20\u00b0.\n\nSection 04 (Fig. 8e) crosses the transfer zone between the SE termination of the M. Vettore Fault and the NW termination of the M. Gorzano Fault (see map in Fig. 1a). It is characterised by an extreme scarcity of shallow seismicity. Consequently, the seismicity is almost totally focused along the BFz, consisting of a nearly horizontal and relatively thin western portion, at a depth of 9\u20139.5\u00a0km, propagating eastward into a steeper (20\u00b0) segment, reaching a depth of about 12\u00a0km. Above the BFz, only sparse seismicity is observed, possibly aligned along the two above-mentioned fault segments.\nAlong Section S05 (Fig. 8f), most of the seismicity is clustered along the trajectory of the Campotosto Fault, and defines a pronounced listric geometry, characterised by a much lower dip angle, compared with that imaged by the SW-dipping nodal plane of the focal mechanisms (ca. 46\u00b0). The southernmost portion of the Campotosto Fault segment was also reactivated during the late phases of the L'Aquila 2009 sequence, showing the same listric geometry (Chiaraluce, 2012; Lavecchia et al., 2011, 2012; Valoroso et al., 2013). Seismicity here is totally confined within the Carbonates and Evaporites of the deepest tectonic unit (Montagna dei Fiori Unit, U4), not propagating into the overlying Laga turbidites, nor into the uppermost Acquasanta-M. Gorzano Unit (U3). The FWs consists of a single cluster, at a depth of 10\u201311\u00a0km, possibly corresponding to an antithetic normal fault. By contrast, the HWs is represented by sparse events, located at shallower depth (4\u20136\u00a0km) within the Acquasanta-M. Gorzano Unit (U3) and possibly aligned along the trajectory of the Montereale Fault. This is the only section where the BFz is not easily traceable: we can only recognise a deep (11\u201312\u00a0km), dense cluster of seismicity located at the base of the seismogenic normal fault, but only few events mark its possible, eastward and westward, prolongations.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nSeismicity distribution with depth\nThe histograms of Fig. 9\n offer a comprehensive view of the seismicity distribution with depth, along the 5 cross sections. For each section, two histograms have been devised: those in black show the total number of events observed from August 2016 to January 2018 whilst those in color show events that occurred during the first two days following the mainshock (MW\u00a0>\u00a05) events intersected by each cross section (\u201cearly aftershocks\u201d, sensu Improta et al., 2019).\nMost histograms (with the exception of that related to section S04) are characterised by a pronounced bimodality. The deeper mode, present in all the sections, corresponds to the BFz and clearly deepens southward (i.e. from S01 to S05) from about 8\u00a0km to about 11\u00a0km. In the sections crossing the M. Vettore-M. Bove Fault System (S01, S02 and S03), the shallower mode (1\u20133.5\u00a0km deep) include both HWs and FWs, occurring in the uppermost tectonic units, consisting of Carbonates and Evaporites. In the sections crossing the Laga Fault System (S04 and S05), the absence of this shallow seismicity is related to presence in the uppermost part of these sections of a thick layer of Turbidites (mainly sandstones and marls of the Laga Fm.), where very few earthquakes are generally observed (e.g. Latorre et al., 2016; Barchi and Collettini, 2019; Michele et al., 2020). However, it is worth noting that along our sections S04 and S05, the layer lacking earthquakes is often thicker that the Turbidites layer. Whilst the histogram of section S04 shows just a single mode, corresponding to the BFz, a peculiar distribution characterizes section S05, whose bimodality is due to the abundant seismicity occurring at intermediate depth (5\u20138\u00a0km), in the Carbonates and Evaporites overlying the BFz layer, which along this section reaches its maximum depth (9\u201312\u00a0km).\n\n\n5.2\nGeometry of the seismological faults\nThe seismicity distribution, in comparison with the geological structures mapped at the surface and extrapolated to depth, along the whole set of five cross-sections of Fig. 8, gives insights into the geometry of the seismogenic master faults active during the 2016\u20132017 sequence.\nFirst of all, our sections confirm that the position and trajectory of the activated faults, depicted by the seismological data (i.e. MFs), are generally consistent with the position at the surface of the Quaternary normal faults and of the co-seismic ruptures, and with their trajectory at depth, suggested by the available seismic data. Indeed, almost complete consensus exists on the connection between the Quaternary normal faults exposed at the surface and the faults seismically activated at depth (\u201cgeological faults\u201d vs. \u201cseismological faults\u201d, sensu Chiaraluce et al., 2005; Barchi and Mirabella, 2009, see also Valensise et al., 2016; Bonini et al., 2019). A similar connection has been also observed for the northernmost Colfiorito Fault system, activated by the 1997\u201398 seismic sequence (Chiaraluce et al., 2005). For the M. Vettore-M. Bove Fault System, this connection was further confirmed by the occurrence of co-seismic surface ruptures along the long-term Quaternary faults (Brozzetti et al., 2019; Civico et al., 2018; Villani et al., 2018, 2018a; Cirillo, 2020). The formation of these surface ruptures was monitored in situ by precise co-seismic GPS measurements (Wilkinson et al., 2017), showing that they are connected to the seismic sources not only in space, but also in time. For the Laga Fault System, even in the absence of clear co-seismic ruptures during the 2016\u20132017 earthquakes, Holocene reactivation of the Quaternary faults is solidly proven by geomorphological evidence (Cacciuni et al., 1995), and paleo-seismological trenches (Galadini and Galli, 2003; Falcucci et al., 2018).\nThe correlation between surface geology and seismicity is more problematic, when the second order extensional structures, formed in the hangingwall and\/or footwall blocks of the Quaternary master faults, are considered. In many sections (e.g. S02, S03, S04), the rock volume affected by the seismicity is quite asymmetric, being thicker and more abundant, in the footwall block (i.e. FWs) than in the hangingwall block. This contrasts with the observation that most of the co-seismic ruptures, observed at the surface (Distributed deformation, sensu Ferrario and Livio, 2018), as well as most of the Quaternary synthetic and antithetic splays, occur in the hangingwall of the activated master faults (e.g. Pierantoni et al., 2013), which also experienced larger displacements compared to the footwall blocks (Bignami et al., 2019). Similar observations have been also reported for normal fault zones from other regions worldwide, where the damage zones are significantly thicker in the hanging walls compared with the footwalls (Reyer et al., 2012 and references therein).\nMoving from the surface and following the fault trajectory at depth, combined geological and seismological data suggest that the dip of the activated faults diminishes, as already observed in the Colfiorito area (Chiaraluce et al., 2005; Barchi and Mirabella, 2009). The major seismogenic normal faults are steeper at the surface (where they crop out dipping 60\u00b0\u201370\u00b0, e.g. Pierantoni et al., 2013; Brozzetti et al., 2019) and become gentler at depth, as also suggested by the nodal plane of the focal mechanisms (42\u00b0\u201350\u00b0; Scognamiglio et al., 2018), as well as by the alignments of seismicity (i.e. MFs), connecting the mainshocks to the active master faults exposed at the surface, which apparently dip less than 40\u00b0 (Fig. 8). Unfortunately, the resolution of our seismic data is not good enough to discriminate if the fault dip changes continuously, describing a proper curvilinear (i.e. listric) fault trajectory (as proposed by Ciaccio et al., 2005 for the Gualdo Tadino fault) or if the fault is composed of an alignment of few planar segments with progressively lower dip, as proposed by Chiaraluce (2012) for the southernmost portion of the Campotosto Fault activated during the 2009\u00a0L'Aquila sequence. It is important to note that, in most cases, the high-resolution seismological data collected in Central Italy do not support the existence of listric active faults (e.g. Chiaraluce, 2012; Chiaraluce et al., 2017; Michele et al., 2020).\nIn their deepest part, the seismogenic master faults, imaged by the seismicity distribution (MFs), terminate downward at the intersection with the BFz, which also corresponds to the seismicity cut-off. Beneath the major active normal faults, the depth and attitude of the BFz generally corresponds to the top of the acoustic basement (Porreca et al., 2018; Mancinelli et al., 2019), as recognized in several seismic profiles, and clearly imaged by a prominent reflector in the line NOR02 (Fig. 6c). In the easternmost part of the sections (Figs. 8, 10c), the BFz propagates through the underlying basement, reaching a depth of 11\u201312\u00a0km. The regional E-dipping overall geometry of the BFz, forming the seismicity cut-off at depth and containing in its hanging-wall the SW-dipping seismogenic normal faults, is compatible with the hypothesis that this deep fault zone may represent a regional E-dipping detachment, driving the extensional deformation of the region (Lavecchia et al., 2017; Chiarabba et al., 2020).\n\n\n5.3\nFault segmentation and the role of inherited structures\nThe overall geological and geophysical evidence illustrated in this paper, clearly indicates that the seismogenic structures activated during the 2016\u20132017 seismic sequence, consist of a complex, highly-segmented system of thick-skinned, NNW-SSE-trending normal faults. There is clear evidence that fault segmentation, both along strike and down-dip, is affected by the inherited compressional structures in the upper crust.\nThe most significant features of the activated fault systems are schematically illustrated in Fig. 10, consisting of three different images, aimed to show:\n\n\u2212\nThe traces at the surface of the activated fault system, described in Chapter 2, which along-strike consists of five major segments, NNW to SSE, namely: the Cupi-Ussita Fault (CUF), the M. Bove Fault (BF) and the M. Vettore Fault (VF), forming the M. Vettore-M. Bove Fault System (VBFS); and the M. Gorzano Fault (GF) and the Campotosto Fault (CF), forming the Laga Fault System (LFS) (Fig. 10a);\n\n\n\u2212\nThe subsurface geometry of the same fault segments, as derived by connecting the trajectory at depth of the faults, imaged along the five geological cross-sections of Fig. 8, with their trace at the surface (Fig. 10b);\n\n\n\u2212\nAn inclined geological section, dipping WSW 47\u00b0, drawn approximately parallel to the envelope of the normal fault planes, showing the geology (i.e. main lithological units and the major thrusts), as viewed looking ENE where it intersects the normal fault system. Along this section, we also projected the seismicity that occurred in both the hanging-wall and foot-wall, for a maximum distance of 2\u00a0km from the modelled surface (Fig. 10c).\n\n\n\nThe inclined geological profile of Fig. 10c offers an immediate, comprehensive view of the relationships between the seismicity distribution and the pre-existing litho-mechanical stratigraphy of the crust (Carminati et al., 2020). The stronger lithological units, such as the Carbonates and Evaporites host the larger part of the seismicity, which is much less abundant in the weaker levels, represented by the Turbidites and by the phyllitic, uppermost part of the Basement. At local scale, sub-horizontal seismicity clusters mostly follow the relatively flat attitude of the single, stacked tectonic units, present along the profile. Considering the whole profile, the along-strike seismicity is distributed along a band of variable thickness, reflecting the overall pre-existing SSE-ward deepening of the stacked units.\nThe complexity of the ruptured system clearly emerges from the history of the seismic sequence, depicted by the seismological data plotted along the profile of Fig. 10c. Here, the early aftershocks, related to the different mainshocks of the sequence, were represented with the same colours, already used for the histograms of Fig. 9; this gives an immediate view of the propagation of the seismic ruptures through time. The sequence, as suggested by Villani et al. (2018b) and Brozzetti et al. (2019), recently summarised by Michele et al. (2020), consists of four major sub-sequences (Fig. 10c, d), illustrated in the sketches of Fig. 11\n:\n\n1.\nThe 24th August mainshock (Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.0) occurred beneath Accumoli village, at the transfer zone between the GF and the VF, with bilateral rupture directivity (Lavecchia et al., 2016; Tinti et al., 2016; Calderoni et al., 2017) (Fig. 11a);\n\n\n2.\nThe 26th October event (Mw\u00a0=\u00a05.9) ruptured the northernmost segments of the system, i.e. BF and CUF, with a strong northward directivity (Chiaraluce et al., 2017) (Fig. 11b);\n\n\n3.\nThe 30th October mainshock (by far the larger one, Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.5) nucleated at the northern tip line of the VF, where it overlaps with the BF, and propagated bilaterally for about 40\u00a0km, rupturing a large part of the system, from the BF to the GF (e.g. Scognamiglio et al., 2018) (Fig. 11c); and\n\n\n4.\nThe 18th January sequence, including four 5.0\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a05.5 earthquakes, ruptured the CF (a segment that was previously indicated by only minor seismicity), propagating northward to its northward termination near Amatrice, where it overlaps with the GF (Fig. 11d).\n\n\n\nConsidering this well-established sequence of events and their spatial distribution with respect to both extensional (i.e. active) and compressional (i.e. inherited) structures, as illustrated along the profile of Fig. 10c and summarised in Fig. 10d and Fig. 11, we can highlight some relevant characteristics of the ruptured fault segments.\nThe location of the mainshocks indicates that most seismic ruptures nucleated at the endpoint of a fault segment (e.g. Wesnousky, 2006) or in the relay zone of two adjacent segments (e.g. 24th August at the overlap between GF and VF; 26th October at the overlap between BF and CUF; Fig. 11a, b). Unlike the previous seismic sequence in the Apennines (1997\u201398 Umbria Marche and 2009\u00a0L'Aquila), these mainshocks are not located at the bottom of the ruptured faults but at intermediate depths (Michele et al., 2020).\nBased on the above described time history of the seismic sequence, in the light of the geological reconstruction shown in Fig. 10c, we suggest that the most important control on the earthquake nucleation is related to the geometrical distribution of the four pre-existing stacked tectonic units (Fig. 10c and Fig. 11). From NNW to SSE, the mainshocks related to the four main sub-sequences occurred within progressively deeper tectonic units, i.e. Umbria-Marche Unit (U1, Visso 26th October); Sarnano-Cittareale Unit (U2, Norcia 30th October); Acquasanta-Gorzano Unit (U3, Accumoli, 24th August); Montagna dei Fiori-Montagnone Unit (U4, Campotosto 18th January 2017), as summarised in Fig. 10d and Fig. 11. This also has important implications for the lithological controls on the earthquake nucleation (Carminati et al., 2020) since all the mainshocks occurred at or near the base of the tectonic units, within the Evaporites (Fig. 10c).\nWe therefore propose a seismotectonic model, schematically illustrated in Fig. 11, where the mainshocks nucleated at the intersection between the tip line of a normal fault segment (dipping about 45\u00b0) and a major thrust (dipping less than 20\u00b0). In a such model, the tectonic units, consisting of Carbonates and Evaporites, act as \u201cchannels\u201d for the lateral propagation of the seismic ruptures, connecting adjacent normal fault segments and driving the rupture propagation across them.\nThe relay zones between adjacent normal fault segments, in turn, can represent, and often actually act, as effective barriers to the rupture propagation. For example, the relay zone between the BF and VF corresponds to the northern endpoint of the 24th August rupture (Fig. 11a), as well as to the southern endpoint of the 26th October rupture (Fig. 11b). However, the same relay zone had a different behaviour during the 30th October earthquake, which nucleated close to this potential barrier, but propagated into the adjacent fault segments (Fig. 11c). Summarising, the segmentation of the active normal faults seems to affect the location of the mainshocks, which are often nucleated in zones of overlap between adjacent segments.\nOur reconstruction also highlights the role played by the inherited, compressional structures in controlling the geometry and segmentation of the active extensional fault system. Previous studies (e.g. Scognamiglio et al., 2018; Improta et al., 2019) postulated the existence at depth of inherited, relatively steep thrust ramps, which were either reactivated as normal\/transtensional faults, or acted as barrier, affecting the first order segmentation of the normal fault system. Alternatively, we propose that a major role is played by the shallow-dipping thrusts that delimit the stacked tectonic units, which mostly behave as passive structures, channelizing the seismicity propagation or, in other cases, acting as barriers, as shown in the sketches of Fig. 11.\nIn addition, the stratigraphy and tectonic setting of the sedimentary cover also affect the along-dip rupture propagation. Even if each earthquake is generated within a specific tectonic unit (Fig. 10d), the related seismicity propagates down-dip through the lower units, down to the BFz, representing the common detachment for the activated fault segments (Fig. 11). The effects of the rupture propagation up-dip are more evident for the segments of the M. Vettore-M. Bove Fault System, affecting the Umbria-Marche Domain, where the seismicity propagates up to the surface forming the well documented co-seismic ruptures; here, the fault trace is also marked by abundant aftershocks. In the segments of the Laga Fault System, the co-seismic effects at the surface are less evident, and we do not observe shallow depth aftershocks.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe integrated approach proposed here allows the complexity of the subsurface geology and the distribution of the seismicity to be compared over the whole area involved in the 2016\u20132017 seismic sequence in Central Italy. The reconstruction of the subsurface geological setting rests on a set of five geological sections, passing through the mainshocks of the sequence, constructed by integrating surface geology and previously unreleased deep seismic data. A set of accurately re-located earthquakes was plotted onto the five geological sections. The along-strike distribution of the seismicity, subdivided into four different sub-sequences, provides a clear picture of the rupture propagation history and a better comprehension of the involved geological structures (Figs. 10 and 11).\nThe main insights inferred by our new seismotectonic model are as follows:\n\n\u2212\nEach seismic rupture starts (nucleates) at the tip line of a major normal fault segment, at a depth where it intersects a pre-existing thrust (i.e. at the base of a tectonic unit);\n\n\n\u2212\nFollowing nucleation, the rupture propagates either along a single fault segment or through multiple adjacent fault segments, following a sub-horizontal \u201cchannel\u201d (path) created by the presence of strong rocks (Carbonates and Evaporites) of the involved tectonic unit;\n\n\n\u2212\nDuring the different rupture events, some of the relay zones between adjacent segments may be either open or closed during different episodes of the seismic sequence, mainly depending on the structural depth (i.e. involved structural unit) where the rupture propagates; and\n\n\n\u2212\nFor each rupture episode (main shock) of the sequence, the total length of the seismogenic fault, and ultimately the earthquake magnitude, depends on the number of involved segments (see Fig. 10d and 11): the larger earthquakes (e.g. Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.5, 2016\/10\/30) involved multi-segment ruptures.\n\n\n\nThese results confirm that the interpretation of seismic profiles gives an improved understanding of the geology at depth, that when integrated with seismological data, allows a far more complete reconstruction of a geomechanical model to account for the evolution of the active fault systems during specified earthquake sequences.\nIt should always be remembered that a reliable seismotectonic model cannot be based solely on surface geology, since the earthquakes nucleate at depth of several km. In both academic and industrial settings, the accurate reconstruction of the geological structures at such depths requires appropriate geophysical surveys. Among the different geophysical techniques, including both active and passive seismic surveys (e.g. seismic tomography, Chiarabba et al., 2018), seismic reflection data, ideally calibrated with deep boreholes and integrated with other geophysical techniques, are able to support a detailed reconstruction of the fault geometry at depth. These are able to give unique insights into which types of rocks are present at seismogenic depths, a precursor requirement for understanding the mechanics of the active faults and, ultimately, of the earthquakes (e.g. Collettini et al., 2009; Tesei et al., 2014).\nThe use of 3D seismic reflection surveys is a common, fundamental practice in the industrial sectors. Unfortunately, these kind of data-sets are seldom available for scientific research. In Italy (but also in most other countries) no large programme of geophysical acquisition and\/or borehole drilling for scientific purposes has been carried out for many years (e.g. CROP project, Scrocca et al., 2003). As in the case of this study, scientists are therefore forced to re-use vintage industrial surveys, designed and acquired for different aims and targets at the end of the last century.\nThis is certainly a problem of funding since 3D seismic surveys are very expensive, especially in an on-shore setting. However, the scientific community should make a stronger, more continuous effort for promoting and funding new campaigns of geophysical acquisition, specifically aimed for scientific purposes.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nME re-processed the geophysical data.

One of its most unusual features is that two oceanic plates are subducting beneath this region. The Philippine Sea (PHS) plate is subducting northwestward beneath the Eurasian plate at the Nankai trough and the Ryukyu trench at a rate of 4\u20135\u00a0cm\/year, whereas the northwestward subducting Pacific plate is located in the upper mantle (~33\u2013410\u00a0km depths) and the mantle transition zone (MTZ, 410\u2013670\u00a0km depths) below the subducting PHS slab under western Japan (e.g., Zhao et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2015). Recent studies show that there are close interactions between the two subducting slabs, in addition to their interactions with the overlying continental Eurasian plate. Another unusual feature of the western Japan arc is that an active rift zone, the Beppu-Shimabara graben, occurs in northern Kyushu (Fig. 1), where several active volcanoes exist and crustal earthquakes take place actively. These distinct features have greatly affected seismotectonics, volcanism and subduction dynamics of the western Japan arc, which are different from those in other subduction zones.\nSeismic activity is very intense in western Japan. Shallow earthquakes occur in the crust of the Eurasian plate, and in the megathrust zone and the subducting PHS plate under the forearc region; intermediate-depth earthquakes occur within the subducting PHS slab down to a depth of ~200\u00a0km; and deep earthquakes occur in the subducting Pacific slab, forming a clear Wadati-Benioff deep seismic zone (e.g., Hasegawa et al., 2009). Large earthquakes take place frequently in western Japan, causing serious damage to the local society, such as the 1995 Kobe earthquake (M 7.2), the 2000 western Tottori earthquake (M 7.3), and the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake (M 7.3). Great megathrust earthquakes occurred in 1944 and 1946 in Tonankai (M 8.1) and Nankai (M 8.3), respectively, and now people are concerned about the next great megathrust event there in the near future. Active volcanoes exist along the volcanic front and in the back-arc area in Kyushu, some of which erupted in the recent past, such as Unzen, Sakurajima and Aso (Fig. 1). Four Quaternary volcanoes (Abu, Sanbe, Daisen and Kannabe) occur in western Honshu (the Chugoku District) along the Japan Sea coast, some of which such as Daisen are considered to be still active at present (e.g., Zhao et al., 2018a; Tatsumi et al., 2020). Due to the complicated tectonic setting and intense seismic and volcanic activities, the crustal and upper mantle structures beneath western Japan are very heterogeneous (e.g., Hasegawa et al., 2009; Ito and Sato, 2010; Matsubara et al., 2008, 2017).\nSince the advent of seismic tomography in mid 1970s, a great number of researchers have investigated the three-dimensional (3-D) crustal and upper mantle structure of the western Japan arc, following the pioneering works of Hirahara (1977, 1981). These tomographic studies have greatly improved our understanding of arc magmatism, seismogenesis and plate subductions in this region (for detailed reviews of the early studies, see Iyer and Hirahara, 1993; Hasegawa et al., 2009). However, the tomographic studies until early 2000s mainly investigated 3-D isotropic seismic velocity structure of the region, though it has been long recognized that strong seismic anisotropy exists in the region by shear-wave splitting studies (e.g., Ando et al., 1983; Kaneshima, 1990). A few early studies investigated 3-D seismic attenuation (Q) structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath western Japan (e.g., Hashida, 1989; Sekiguchi, 1991; Salah and Zhao, 2003a), but those Q tomographic models have a very low resolution.\nIn the past decade, there have been significant advances in seismic imaging of the western Japan arc, including not only seismic velocity tomography, but also anisotropic tomography, attenuation tomography and receiver-function imaging. In this article, we review these recent findings and discuss their implications for the crustal and mantle structure, volcanism, seismotectonics, and subduction dynamics in western Japan.\n\n\n2\nSeismic velocity and attenuation tomography\nTomographic studies until the early 2000s mainly focused on the inland areas of Japan, where dense seismic networks are installed and so allow for high-resolution seismic imaging. Hence, detailed 3-D velocity images of the entire western Japan arc, from the Nankai trough to the Japan Sea, were not determined because few ocean-bottom-seismometer (OBS) stations were\/are deployed in the Philippine Sea and the Japan Sea. Thus, suboceanic earthquakes cannot be located accurately with the routine procedure by using the land-based seismic network. However, the suboceanic events that occurred outside a seismic network could be located precisely (with a hypocentral uncertainty < ~3\u00a0km) using sP depth-phase data that are very sensitive to the focal depth, because the bouncing point of the sP depth phase is very close to the earthquake epicenter (Umino et al., 1995). Zhao et al. (2002, 2007) developed an off-network tomography method whose principle is to use P and S wave arrival times from the suboceanic earthquakes relocated precisely with sP depth phases, though all the phases were recorded at the land-based seismic stations. This approach was first applied to the NE Japan arc (Zhao et al., 2002; Mishra et al., 2003), and then it was used to determine 3-D P and S wave velocity (Vp and Vs) images in the forearc and back-arc areas in Kyushu (Wang and Zhao, 2006a, 2006b).\nUsing the off-network tomography method, Liu et al. (2013) determined the first high-resolution 3-D Vp and Vs models of the entire western Japan arc from the Nankai trough to the Japan Sea (Fig. 2\n). They collected and used much more data than any of the previous tomographic studies of this region. Their results reveal strong lateral heterogeneities in the crust and upper mantle under the region, and their Vp and Vs images exhibit the same pattern (see Liu et al., 2013 for details). The subducting PHS slab is imaged clearly as a high-velocity (high-V) zone. Low-velocity (low-V) anomalies are revealed in the crust and upper-mantle wedge under the active volcanoes, which reflect arc magmas produced by joint effects of fluids from the slab dehydration and corner flow in the mantle wedge (e.g., Tatsumi, 1989; Hasegawa and Zhao, 1994; Iwamori and Zhao, 2000). Significant velocity heterogeneities are also revealed in the forearc region, which are described and discussed in detail in Section 4. The velocity features under the land areas are consistent with those of the previous tomographic models, whereas new features are revealed in the offshore areas (see Section 4 for details).\nApplying the same approach of off-network tomography, Liu and Zhao (2015) determined the first high-resolution P and S wave attenuation (Qp and Qs) tomography of the crust and upper mantle under the entire western Japan arc from the Nankai trough to the Japan Sea using a large number of t\u204e\n data measured from P and S wave spectra of local earthquakes (Fig. 3\n). The suboceanic events under the Pacific Ocean and the Japan Sea used in their study were relocated precisely using sP depth phases and some OBS data. The overall pattern of the obtained Q models is similar to that of the velocity models (Fig. 2). Their results reveal high-Q (i.e., weak attenuation) anomalies in the upper crust that generally correspond to plutonic rocks widely exposed in western Japan. Some low-Q (i.e., strong attenuation) anomalies in the upper crust along the Pacific coast are associated with the Cretaceous-Cenozoic accretionary wedge (e.g., Ito and Sato, 2010). Significant low-Q zones exist in the crust under the active volcanoes. Most of the large inland crustal earthquakes are located in or around the low-V and low-Q zones in the crust (Fig. 2). The subducting PHS slab is imaged clearly as a landward dipping high-Q zone where intermediate-depth earthquakes occur. Prominent low-Q anomalies exist in the mantle wedge under the volcanic front and back-arc area, which reflect the source zone of arc magmatism and volcanism, as imaged by the Vp and Vs tomography. Significant low-V and low-Q anomalies are revealed in the forearc mantle wedge, reflecting a highly hydrated and serpentinized forearc mantle wedge due to abundant fluids released from dehydration of the young and warm PHS slab, similar to the feature revealed by previous tomographic models (e.g., Zhao et al., 2000; Xia et al., 2008a; Matsubara et al., 2009) and receiver-function results (e.g., Abe et al., 2011) of the region.\nHigh-resolution Q tomographic images are also determined beneath Kyushu (Saita et al., 2015) and in the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake (M 7.3) area (e.g., Wang et al., 2017a; Komatsu et al., 2017). Recently, detailed 3-D Qp and Qs tomographic models of the entire Japan subduction zones are obtained (Wang et al., 2017b; Wang and Zhao, 2019a), which have a high resolution comparable to that of velocity tomography (Fig. 4\n). The regional Q models exhibit generally the same features revealed by the local Q models in western Japan. These detailed velocity and attenuation images provide new constraints on temperature variations and fluid contents in the crust and upper mantle of the Japan subduction zone.\n\nFig. 4 also shows that the intermediate-depth seismicity in the subducting Pacific slab occurs in two parallel planes with a separation of ~30\u00a0km, which is called the double seismic zone discovered in mid 1970s (Umino and Hasegawa, 1975; Hasegawa et al., 1978). The upper-plane events occur in the top part of the slab, whereas the lower-plane events occur in the central part of the slab. The earthquakes in the two planes have different focal mechanisms and exhibit regional variations. In Tohoku (NE Honshu), the events in the upper and lower planes are dominated by down-dip compression and down-dip extension mechanisms, respectively. However, a reverse pattern of focal mechanisms in the two planes occurs in Hokkaido. The occurrence and focal mechanisms of the double seismic zone in the Pacific slab are explained by the slab deformation during its subduction, such as bending or unbending, as well as other processes such as hydration and dehydration (see Hasegawa et al., 2009 for a detailed review). A double seismic zone also exists in the subducting PHS slab, but the two planes are very close and so not clearly visible as those in the Pacific slab (e.g., Hasegawa et al., 2009).\n\n\n3\nSeismic anisotropy and mantle flow\nSeismic anisotropy is a property of the Earth's material that describes the dependence of seismic velocity on the wave propagation direction. Major causes of seismic anisotropy are lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) of materials constituting the Earth or shape-preferred orientation (SPO) of micro-structures such as fluid-filled cracks and melts (e.g., Babuska and Cara, 1991; Karato et al., 2008; Jung, 2017). Many studies of shear-wave splitting (SWS) have been made in Japan, suggesting that strong seismic anisotropy exists in this subduction zone (e.g., Ando et al., 1983; Kaneshima, 1990; Hiramatsu et al., 1997; Nakajima and Hasegawa, 2004; Salah et al., 2009; Wirth and Long, 2010; Huang et al., 2011a, 2011b; Savage et al., 2016). However, the SWS measurements have a poor depth resolution, i.e., they cannot identify the depth at which seismic anisotropy occurs, whereas this drawback can be overcome by P-wave anisotropic tomography (e.g., Eberhart-Phillips and Henderson, 2004; Ishise and Oda, 2005, 2008; Wang and Zhao, 2008, 2013; Zhao et al., 2016).\nTo date, several studies have investigated the 3-D Vp anisotropic structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath western Japan. Ishise and Oda (2008) used local-earthquake arrival times to determine a 3-D model of Vp azimuthal anisotropy under Chugoku and Shikoku districts, and found that the subducting PHS slab exhibits strong azimuthal anisotropy with a N-S fast-velocity direction (FVD). Wang and Zhao (2012) obtained a more detailed 3-D model of Vp azimuthal tomography of the crust and upper mantle beneath western Japan. The FVD in Kyushu is generally trench-normal in the mantle wedge under the back-arc, which may reflect corner flow driven by the PHS slab subduction. The FVD is trench-parallel in the subducting PHS slab under Kyushu. They also suggested that the intraslab seismicity is a potential indicator of the slab anisotropy. That is, the PHS slab with seismicity has kept its original fossil anisotropy formed at the mid-ocean ridge, whereas the aseismic PHS slab has reproduced its anisotropy due to its current deformation in the upper mantle. Note that seismicity is a kind of thermometer for the subducting slab. The occurrence of intraslab seismicity indicates that the slab is still cold and brittle enough to generate earthquakes. In contrast, an aseismic slab may have a higher temperature and so become ductile, probably because the slab has stayed longer in the hot mantle and so has experienced more deformations. As a result, anisotropy of the aseismic slab has been reproduced.\n\nWang and Zhao (2013) determined 3-D Vp models of both radial and azimuthal anisotropies beneath Tohoku and Kyushu. They revealed trench-normal FVDs in the back-arc mantle wedge in both Tohoku and Kyushu, which reflect the slab-driven corner flow. Trench-parallel FVDs appear in the forearc mantle wedge under Tohoku and Kyushu, suggesting the possible existence of B-type olivine fabric there. Trench-parallel FVDs also occur in the mantle wedge under the volcanic front in Tohoku but not in Kyushu, suggesting that 3-D flow may exist in the mantle wedge under Tohoku, which was also revealed by Huang et al. (2011c). Negative radial anisotropy (i.e., vertical Vp\u00a0>\u00a0horizontal Vp) is revealed in the low-V zones in the mantle wedge under the volcanoes in Tohoku and Kyushu as well as in the low-V zones below the PHS slab under Kyushu, which may reflect hot upwelling flows and transitions of olivine fabrics with the presence of water in the upper mantle. This feature of radial anisotropy was also revealed recently in other subduction zones, such as Alps (Hua et al., 2017), Alaska (Gou et al., 2019a), and the Philippines (Fan and Zhao, 2019). Trench-parallel FVDs and positive radial anisotropy (i.e., horizontal Vp\u00a0>\u00a0vertical Vp) occur in the subducting Pacific slab under Tohoku and the PHS slab under Kyushu, suggesting that the slabs may keep their frozen-in anisotropy formed at the mid-ocean ridge (Ishise and Oda, 2005; Wang and Zhao, 2008; Ishise et al., 2018) or that the slab anisotropy is induced by LPO of the B-type olivine (Wang and Zhao, 2013). Recently, Wang et al. (2019a) revealed detailed 3-D anisotropic structure of the forearc mantle wedge under Tohoku. They proposed a new geodynamic model suggesting that the trench-parallel anisotropy in the forearc mantle wedge is produced mainly via ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle rather than asthenospheric flow. Their model accords well with the trench-parallel SWS measurements dominant in the forearc mantle wedge of global subduction zones, as summarized by Long and Wirth (2013). They also found that the trench-parallel anisotropy induced by the B-type olivine fabric may appear only in a relatively thin layer above the subducting slab, as suggested by Katayama (2009).\nUsing a large number of travel-time data of both local earthquakes and teleseismic events recorded by the dense seismic networks on the Japan Islands, Liu and Zhao (2016a, 2016b) and Liu and Zhao (2017)) systematically investigated the 3-D seismic anisotropy structure of the entire Japan subduction zone including western Japan. Liu and Zhao (2016a) modified and extended the Vp tomographic method for azimuthal anisotropy to invert S-wave travel times for 3-D Vs azimuthal anisotropy. They also performed a joint inversion of the P and S wave data to constrain the 3-D azimuthal anisotropy beneath Japan. Their results show that the subducting Pacific and PHS slabs exhibit mainly trench-parallel FVDs, which may reflect frozen-in LPO of aligned anisotropic minerals as well as SPO due to normal faults produced at the outer-rise area near the trench axis. Trench-normal FVDs are generally revealed in the mantle wedge, reflecting corner flows due to the plate subduction and dehydration. Trench-normal FVDs also occur in the subslab mantle, reflecting the mantle flows entrained by the overlying slabs (Liu and Zhao, 2016a).\nA 3-D model of Vs azimuthal anisotropy in and around Japan down to a depth of ~300\u00a0km was obtained by using a large number of amplitude and phase data of teleseismic fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves (Liu and Zhao, 2016b). The subducting Pacific slab is imaged as a dipping high-Vs zone with trench-parallel FVDs, which may indicate the anisotropy arising from the normal faults produced at the outer-rise area near the Japan trench, overprinting the slab fossil fabric. The low-Vs mantle wedge generally exhibits trench-normal FVDs, reflecting subduction-driven corner flow and anisotropy. Depth variations of azimuthal anisotropy are revealed in the lithosphere and the big mantle wedge (BMW) beneath the Japan Sea, which may reflect past deformations of the Eurasian lithosphere related to the Japan Sea back-arc spreading during 21 to 15\u00a0Ma and complex current convection in the BMW induced by the active subductions of both the Pacific and PHS plates.\nThe interpretations of these 3-D Vp and Vs models of azimuthal anisotropy are generally consistent with those of SWS studies of the western Japan arc (e.g., Ando et al., 1983; Kaneshima, 1990; Hiramatsu et al., 1997; Salah et al., 2009; Wirth and Long, 2010; Savage et al., 2016). However, the 3-D anisotropic models have a much higher depth resolution than the SWS results and revealed many new features of subduction dynamics, hence their conclusions are more convincing and robust than the SWS studies.\nAssuming orthorhombic anisotropy with a vertical symmetry axis in the modeling space, Liu and Zhao (2017) simultaneously determined isotropic Vp tomography and 3-D Vp azimuthal and radial anisotropies beneath Japan. According to a simple flow field and the obtained Vp anisotropic results, they estimated the distribution of olivine fabrics in the mantle wedge. The forearc mantle wedge above the Pacific slab beneath NE Japan exhibits azimuthal anisotropy with trench-parallel FVDs and Vhf\u00a0>\u00a0Vv\u00a0>\u00a0Vhs, where B-type olivine fabric with vertical trench-parallel flow may dominate. This anisotropic feature is not obvious in the forearc mantle wedge above the PHS slab under western Japan, probably due to higher temperatures, more fluids, and a higher degree of serpentinization there associated with the young and warm PHS slab subduction (Fig. 5\n). Trench-normal FVDs and Vhf\u00a0>\u00a0Vv\u00a0>\u00a0Vhs generally occur in the mantle wedge beneath the arc and back-arc areas, where E-type olivine fabric with FVD-parallel horizontal flow may dominate. In the Chugoku district, however, the mantle wedge exhibits an anisotropy of Vv\u00a0>\u00a0Vhf\u00a0>\u00a0Vhs and so C-type olivine fabric may dominate there, suggesting a high water content there, because both the PHS and Pacific slabs exist there and their dehydration reactions release abundant fluids to the overlying mantle wedge (Fig. 5; Zhao et al., 2018a). To date, such a joint inversion for 3-D azimuthal and radial anisotropies has been only performed in Japan. This kind of study should be also made for other subduction zones to investigate whether the anisotropic features found in Japan also appear in other regions. However, this joint inversion requires a dense and high-quality permanent or portable seismic network in the study region, which may be realized in more and more subduction zones in the near future.\n\n\n4\nForearc structure and megathrust earthquakes\nLarge interplate megathrust earthquakes (M\u00a0>\u00a07) took place in the western Japan forearc with an interval of ~100 to 150\u00a0years (Ando, 1975). Because of a fast convergence rate (4\u20136\u00a0cm\/yr) and a young buoyant lithosphere, the subducting PHS plate and the overriding Eurasian plate are strongly coupled in the forearc region along the upper boundary of the subducting PHS plate (Fig. 1). The landward downdip limit of the seismogenic megathrust zone is located at a depth of ~30\u201340\u00a0km, marked by the occurrence of episodic tremors and slips. The seaward updip limit is not very distinct, being generally at a depth of ~10\u00a0km and correlated with a suite of diagenetic to low-grade metamorphic processes (Moore and Saffer, 2001; Tsuji et al., 2014). The seismic structure of the forearc region is not well studied yet, because it is located offshore and covered by limited OBS stations. A few local tomographic studies were made for some parts of the forearc region, suggesting a possible relationship between the earthquake distribution and seismic velocity variation in the megathrust zone (Wang and Zhao, 2006a; Tahara et al., 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2014).\nTo clarify causal mechanisms of the megathrust earthquakes, Liu and Zhao (2014) obtained detailed 3-D P and S wave velocity (Vp, Vs), attenuation (Qp, Qs) and Poisson's ratio (\u03c3) images of the western Japan forearc (Fig. 6\n) using a large number of arrival-time and t\u204e\n data measured from seismograms of local earthquakes. The suboceanic events used were relocated precisely using sP depth phase and OBS data. They revealed two prominent high-V, high-Q and low-\u03c3 patches separated by low-V, low-Q and high-\u03c3 anomalies in the megathrust zone (Fig. 6). Large megathrust earthquakes during 1900 to 2013 nucleated in or around the high-V, high-Q and low-\u03c3 patches, which may represent strongly coupled areas (i.e., asperities) in the megathrust zone. Their results suggest that structural heterogeneities in the megathrust zone, such as the subducting seafloor topography and compositional variations, control the nucleation of the megathrust earthquakes, similar to those in the Tohoku megathrust zone (e.g., Zhao et al., 2011; Huang and Zhao, 2013a, 2013b; Liu and Zhao, 2018; Hua et al., 2020).\nRecently, 3-D high-resolution Vp, Vs and Poisson's ratio images of the western Japan forearc are determined by using a large number of arrival-time data of well-located onshore and offshore local earthquakes (Niu et al., 2020). The obtained seismic images, as well as residual topography and gravity anomalies, show similar structures in both the upper and lower plates above and below the rupture zones of the 1944 Tonankai earthquake (M 8.1), the 1946 Nankai earthquake (M 8.3), and the 1968 Hyuganada earthquake (M 7.5). The results indicate that the nucleation and rupture processes of these megathrust earthquakes were controlled by structural variations in both the upper and lower plates, similar to those in the Tohoku forearc (Liu and Zhao, 2018; Hua et al., 2020). However, the physical properties and seismogenesis of the megathrust zone in the western Japan forearc appear more complicated than those in the Tohoku forearc, due to the complex PHS slab morphology (Fig. 1) and large lateral variations in the PHS slab age as shown in the next section.\n\n\n5\nMorphology and age of the Philippine Sea slab\nMany researchers have investigated the morphology of the subducting PHS slab beneath western Japan and the Ryukyu arc using local seismicity and local earthquake tomography (e.g., Ishida, 1992; Hirose et al., 2007, 2008, 2009; Nakajima et al., 2009; Yamamoto et al., 2018, 2020), analysis of converted and reflected waves (see Zhao, 2019 for a detailed review), and teleseismic receiver functions (e.g., Shiomi et al., 2004). The location and geometry of the PHS slab upper boundary determined with these different approaches are generally consistent with each other. However, these studies could only map the PHS slab down to the cut-off depth of intermediate-depth seismicity within the PHS slab, which is ~100\u00a0km depth in Honshu and Shikoku, and\u00a0~\u00a0200\u00a0km depth in Kyushu. In contrast, teleseismic tomography studies have revealed the deep, aseismic portion of the PHS slab. Zhao et al. (2012) firstly mapped the aseismic PHS slab by conducting a joint inversion of P-wave arrival-time data of local and teleseismic events recorded by the Japanese seismic networks and found that the PHS slab has subducted aseismically (i.e., without earthquakes in the slab) down to ~430\u00a0km depth. Their results show that the aseismic PHS slab is composed of two patches: one is located under the Japan Sea off the Chugoku district, the other is located under the Tsushima Strait and the East China Sea (Fig. 1). The two patches are not connected, and a slab window is formed in between (Fig. 1). Huang et al. (2013) confirmed the results of Zhao et al. (2012) by using the local and teleseismic P-wave data recorded by the seismic networks in both Japan and South Korea (Fig. 7\n).\nPerforming a joint inversion of S-wave arrival-time data of local and teleseismic events, Asamori and Zhao (2015) obtained the first 3-D Vs tomography and Poisson's ratio (PR) images of the Japan subduction zone down to a depth of 700\u00a0km (Fig. 8\n). Their Vs tomography has also revealed the deep aseismic PHS slab and so confirmed the Vp tomographic results by Zhao et al. (2012) and Huang et al. (2013). Prominent low-V and high-PR anomalies exist below the PHS slab and above the Pacific slab, which reflect hot and wet mantle upwelling caused by the joint effect of deep dehydration of the Pacific slab and convective circulation process in the mantle wedge above the Pacific slab (Fig. 8). The hot and wet mantle upwelling has caused the complex geometry and structure of the PHS slab in western Japan, and contributed to the Quaternary volcanism along the Japan Sea coast (Asamori and Zhao, 2015; Zhao et al., 2018a).\nRegional tomographic models of East Asia have also revealed the aseismic PHS slab down to the MTZ depth beneath the Ryukyu arc and East China, suggesting that the PHS slab has joined the Pacific slab to form the stagnant slab in the MTZ under East Asia (e.g., Zhao, 2004; Huang and Zhao, 2006; Wei et al., 2012, 2015; Ma et al., 2019). Above the stagnant slab, a big mantle wedge (BMW) has formed. Due to corner flow in the BMW and fluids from the deep slab dehydration, hot and wet upwelling flows in the BMW caused the opening of the Japan Sea and the Okinawa trough, as well as the intraplate volcanoes in the Korean Peninsula and NE China (Zhao et al., 2004, 2009; Lei and Zhao, 2005; Chen et al., 2017; Kuritani et al., 2019; Wei and Zhao, 2020).\nSimilar complex structures in and around the MTZ associated with plate subduction are also found beneath North America. Schmandt and Lin (2014) used teleseismic P and S wave tomography to investigate the 3-D mantle structure beneath the United States spanning from the active western plate margin to the passive eastern margin. They revealed two distinct low-V anomalies at depths of ~60\u2013300\u00a0km beneath the central and northern Appalachians and passive margin. The central Appalachian low-V anomaly coincides with Eocene basaltic magmatism, and the northern anomaly is located along the Cretaceous track of the Great Meteor hot spot. At depths of ~300\u2013700\u00a0km beneath the central and eastern U.S., large high-V anomalies are inferred to be remnants of the Farallon slab that subducted prior to ~40\u00a0Ma during the Laramide orogeny (Schmandt and Lin, 2014; Wang et al., 2019b). The Farallon slab stagnant in the MTZ and Cenozoic intraplate volcanism associated with upwelling flows in the BMW are also revealed in South America (see Navarrete et al., 2020 for a detailed review).\nBy using a regional Vp tomographic model (Wei et al., 2012) and paleo-age data of ancient seafloor (M\u00fcller et al., 2008), the lithospheric age distribution of the subducting Pacific slab beneath East Asia was estimated (Liu et al., 2017). Their results show that the Pacific slab age becomes younger from the Japan Trench (~130 million years, Myr) to the slab's western edge (~90 Myr) beneath East China, and the stagnant slab in the MTZ is the subducted Pacific plate rather than the proposed Izanagi plate that should have already collapsed down to the lower mantle. The flat Pacific slab has been in the MTZ for no more than ~10\u201320 Myr. Hence, the present stagnant slab in the MTZ has contributed to the Cenozoic destruction of the East Asian continental lithosphere with extensive intraplate volcanism and back-arc spreading, whereas the destruction of the North China Craton during the Early Cretaceous (~140\u2013110\u00a0Ma) was caused by the subduction of the Izanagi (or the Paleo-Pacific) plate.\n\nHua et al. (2018) applied the approach of Liu et al. (2017) to estimate the lithosphere age distribution of the subducting PHS slab in western Japan (Fig. 9\n). They found that the youngest part (~15 Myr) of the PHS slab is located beneath the Kii channel where the fossil Shikoku spreading ridge exists. The lithosphere age increases with the along-arc distance from the fossil Shikoku ridge and reaches ~42 Myr in SW Kyushu (Fig. 9). Non-volcanic low-frequency micro-earthquakes (LFEs) occur in western Japan around the Moho depth (30\u201335\u00a0km) with a belt-like distribution and the PHS slab ages of 17\u201326 Myr, whereas there is no LFE in the Kii Channel where a tear in the PHS slab may exist in the extinct Shikoku spreading ridge. The youngest lithosphere age (~15 Myr) of the PHS slab leads to the minimum thickness (~29\u00a0km) and the highest temperature of the PHS slab. In the Kii Channel, other factors are low fluid content, high permeability of the overlying Eurasian plate, lack of hydrous minerals, and hot mantle upwelling below the PHS slab (e.g., Asamori and Zhao, 2015; Zhao et al., 2012, 2018a). The joint effect of all these factors may have caused the LFE gap beneath the Kii Channel (Hua et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017c).\nThe influence of the slab age variation on seismic and volcanic activities has been also suggested for other subduction zones, such as Northwest Pacific (Zhao, 2012; Liu et al., 2017), Alaska and Aleutians (Gou et al., 2019a, 2020), Cascadia (Long, 2016; Bostock et al., 2019), and South America (Comte and Pardo, 1991; Navarrete et al., 2020), though detailed distribution of the slab age has not been mapped in those regions, which is a subject of future studies.\n\n\n6\nThe Beppu-Shimabara graben\nA unique tectonic feature of Kyushu is that the central part of the island is subject to north-south extensional stress, whereas the crust of the Japan Islands is generally affected by compressive regional stress (e.g., Kato et al., 2016; Matsumoto et al., 2018). Extensional deformation runs east-west across central Kyushu, resulting in the Beppu-Shimabara graben (BSG) where four active volcanoes (Tsurumi, Kuju, Aso and Unzen) exist, in particular, Mt. Aso with a large caldera whose area is ~400\u00a0km2. A number of M6 class historical earthquakes occurred in and around the BSG (Usami, 2003) that is under a heterogeneous stress regime associated with both right-lateral faults and normal faults whose tensional axes trend north-south (Matsumoto et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019). The latest large event in the BSG was the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence consisting of two large foreshocks (M 6.5 and 6.4) on April 14\u201315 and a mainshock (M 7.3) on April 16, 2016. Concerning the driving force of the extensional deformation in central Kyushu, two hypotheses have been proposed: northward extension of the opening Okinawa Trough (Nakahigashi et al., 2004), and transient variations in the convergence direction of the PHS plate (Itoh et al., 2014). However, the detailed structure and origin of the BSG are still not clear.\n\nZhao et al. (2018b) determined detailed 3-D Vp, Vs and Poisson's ratio images of the crust and upper mantle down to 100\u00a0km depth beneath the entire Kyushu Island, with a focus on the 2016 Kumamoto source area and the BSG (Figs. 10\n and 11). Along the BSG, although low-V and high-\u03c3 anomalies are generally visible in the lower crust and uppermost mantle, the anomalies do not exist everywhere in the upper mantle but mainly beneath the active volcanoes. Under the non-volcanic areas of the graben, the low-V and high-\u03c3 anomalies are not significant in the crust and upper mantle (Fig. 11\n). These results suggest that hot mantle upwelling seems not the main cause of this rift zone. The southern boundary of the BSG, the so-called Oita-Kumamoto tectonic line, is considered to be westward extension of the Median Tectonic Line (MTL; Kusumoto, 2016). The MTL, together with the Northern Chugoku shear zone (or the Southern Japan Sea fault zone) along the Japan Sea coast, are mainly caused by the oblique subduction of the PHS plate beneath the Eurasian plate, resulting in the right-lateral strike-slip motions along these tectonic lines and shear zones (Gutscher and Lallemand, 1999; Itoh et al., 2002). From this point of view, the BSG is considered to be a passive rift rather than an active rift related to hot mantle upwelling or plumes (e.g., Logatchev et al., 1983; Zhao, 2015). However, because the BSG is located in the volcanic arc and back-arc areas where active volcanoes and magmatic fluids exist and the temperature is generally higher, the Eurasian plate becomes much thinner and mechanically much weaker in the BSG than that in Shikoku and central Japan. Thus, it is easier for the MTL to extend westward to North-Central Kyushu, being driven by the oblique subduction of the PHS plate.\nTaking into account all the previous findings and the new tomographic results (Figs. 10 and 11), Zhao et al. (2018b) proposed that the BSG was produced by the joint effect of three factors: (1) northward extension of the opening Okinawa Trough; (2) westward extension of the MTL; and (3) hot and wet upwelling flow in the mantle wedge beneath the active volcanoes (Tsurumi, Kuju, Aso and Unzen) in North-Central Kyushu.\n\n\n7\nLarge crustal earthquakes\nIn western Japan, large earthquakes often take place in the crust of the overlying Eurasian plate. These events occur widely in the forearc and back-arc areas, and close to the volcanoes along the volcanic front, similar to those in NE Japan (e.g., Zhao, 2015). A typical large crustal earthquake in western Japan is the 1995 Kobe earthquake (M 7.2). Zhao et al. (1996) determined 3-D Vp, Vs and \u03c3 images of the Kobe source zone and revealed a low-V and high-\u03c3 anomaly in the lower crust below the Kobe hypocenter at ~17\u00a0km depth. This anomaly was interpreted as a fluid-filled, fractured rock matrix that triggered the Kobe mainshock. Later studies have shown that the fluids at the Kobe hypocenter originated from the dehydration reactions of the subducting PHS slab (Zhao et al., 2002; Salah and Zhao, 2003b; Tong et al., 2011).\nAlmost all the active and Quaternary volcanoes in western Japan are accompanied by one or more large crustal earthquakes nearby (Fig. 2). Recent large events that occurred near a volcano are the 2000 western Tottori earthquake, the 2016 central Tottori earthquake, and the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake (Fig. 1). The two Tottori earthquakes took place near the Daisen volcano (Fig. 1), which is a large composite volcano with a volume of >120\u00a0km3, ranging in age from 0.017 to 1.2\u00a0Ma and consisting of several clustered and overlapping lava domes (Kimura et al., 2005; Tokunaga et al., 2010). Seismological studies have shown that the horizontally subducting PHS slab has reached the Daisen volcano, though there is no intraslab seismicity beneath western Honshu (e.g., Nakanishi, 1980; Hirahara, 1981; Zhao et al., 2002). Geochemical studies of the Daisen volcanic rocks suggested that melting of the young PHS slab occurs beneath the Daisen volcano, producing adakite magmas (e.g., Morris, 1995; Tokunaga et al., 2010; Feineman et al., 2013; Kimura et al., 2014), though some researchers proposed that lower crustal water controls on the formation of the Daisen adakitic melts (Zellmer et al., 2012). The 2000 Tottori earthquake occurred ~30\u00a0km to the southwest of the Daisen volcano, whereas the 2016 Tottori earthquake took place ~25\u00a0km to the east of the Daisen volcano. Zhao et al. (2018a) investigated the 3-D seismic structure beneath Tottori and Daisen and found that two large events took place in a high-V zone in the upper crust, whereas low-V and high-\u03c3 anomalies exist in the lower crust and upper mantle (Fig. 12\n). Low-frequency micro-earthquakes (M 0.0\u20132.5) also occurred in and around the low-V and high-\u03c3 zones, which reflect upward migration of magmatic fluids from the upper mantle to the crust under the Daisen volcano. The flat PHS slab has a younger lithosphere (< 21 Myr) and so a higher temperature beneath the Daisen and Tottori area (Fig. 9), facilitating the PHS slab melting. These results suggest that the Daisen adakite magma and the Tottori earthquakes were affected by the PHS slab melting as well as hot and wet upwelling in the upper mantle above the subducting Pacific slab (Fig. 8).\nThe 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence was caused by ruptures of the Futagawa and Hinagu fault zones, which are representative active faults in Kyushu and form the southern boundary of the BSG (Toda et al., 2016). This earthquake sequence has extended toward the southwest and the northeast, reaching Oita Prefecture in NE Kyushu, indicating that most of the BSG has been activated that is composed of many active faults (Toda et al., 2016; Mochizuki and Mitsui, 2016). The closest volcano to the mainshock, Mt. Aso, has been more active before and after the Kumamoto earthquake, in particular, it erupted on 8 October 2016 (i.e., about 6\u00a0months after the Kumamoto mainshock), suggesting that the volcano and the earthquakes have been interacting with each other (Ozawa et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b). Tomographic images of the Kumamoto source zone (Fig. 11 and profile D in Fig. 10) show that its mainshock occurred in a high-V and low-\u03c3 zone in the upper crust, whereas the lower crust right beneath the hypocenter exhibits average or slightly lower velocities but a high-\u03c3. In the uppermost mantle under the mainshock hypocenter, Vp and Vs are very low, and \u03c3 is higher. In the areas adjacent to the mainshock hypocenter, prominent low-V and high-\u03c3 anomalies exist in the crust and upper mantle, in particular, under the active Aso and Unzen volcanoes. These results suggest that the generation of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake was affected by magmatic fluids ascending from the mantle wedge, and then the big earthquake facilitated the eruption of the nearby Aso volcano (Zhao et al., 2018b).\nA recent large crustal event in the back-arc area of western Japan is the 2005 west off-Fukuoka earthquake (M 7.0). Wang and Zhao (2006b) revealed strong structural heterogeneities in the hypocentral area, which might reflect the existence of fluids, geometrical irregularities of the fault zone, and geothermal anomalies in the region. The mainshock hypocenter was located near a distinct zone characterized by a low-V, high-\u03c3 and high-conductivity anomaly that may reflect fluids in and around the source area. The fluids, ascending from the wet mantle wedge, might have reduced seismic velocity of the crustal materials around the mainshock hypocenter and weakened the mechanical strength of the fractured rock matrix in the source zone, and thus triggered the 2005 west off-Fukuoka earthquake.\nSimilar features of structural anomalies containing fluids in source zones of large crustal earthquakes are also found in eastern Japan (e.g., Xia et al., 2008b; Cheng et al., 2011; Zhao, 2015; Hua et al., 2019; Gou et al., 2019b), Taiwan (e.g., Toyokuni et al., 2016), and the Asian continental regions (e.g., Kayal et al., 2002; Mishra and Zhao, 2003; Huang and Zhao, 2004; Lei and Zhao, 2009; Wei and Zhao, 2016; Sun et al., 2019; Sun and Zhao, 2020). All these results suggest that the generation of a large earthquake is not entirely a mechanical process, but is closely related to physical and chemical properties of materials in the crust and upper mantle, such as magma and fluids (Zhao et al., 2002, 2018a, 2018b). The rupture nucleation zone should have a 3-D spatial extent, not just limited to the 2-D fault plane, as suggested earlier by Tsuboi (1956) with the concept of earthquake volume. Complex physical and chemical reactions may take place in the source zone of a future earthquake, causing heterogeneities in the material property and stress field, which can be detected with seismic tomography and other geophysical methods. These results indicate that large earthquakes do not strike anywhere randomly, but only anomalous areas that may be detected by geophysical imaging. High-resolution seismic tomography and combining seismological studies with geological, geochemical, and geophysical investigations would certainly improve our understanding of the earthquake nucleation process and contribute to the reduction of seismic hazards. To date, a great number of studies have been made for many regions in the world to correlate the earthquake nucleation with geophysical images, which indicate that the nucleation of almost all the large earthquakes was affected or controlled by structural anomalies in and around the seismogenic fault zones (for a detailed review, see Chapter 4 in Zhao, 2015).\n\n\n8\nConcluding remarks\nThe main findings of seismological studies of the western Japan arc so far can be summarized as follows.\n\n(1)\nHigh-resolution seismic velocity and attenuation tomography has imaged the subducting Pacific and PHS slabs clearly as high-V and high-Q zones. Prominent low-V and low-Q anomalies are revealed in the crust and mantle wedge beneath the volcanic front and back-arc areas in western Japan, which reflect arc magmas formed by a joint effect of corner flow in the mantle wedge and fluids from the slab dehydration reactions. Low-V and low-Q zones also exist widely in the forearc mantle wedge under western Japan, reflecting forearc mantle serpentinization due to abundant fluids from the young and warm PHS slab. Low-V anomalies are revealed below the PHS slab and above the Pacific slab under western Japan, which reflect upwelling flow in the big mantle wedge (BMW) above the Pacific slab and may heat the PHS slab from below. Hence, the PHS slab becomes aseismic at depths >100\u00a0km beneath Shikoku and Chugoku.\n\n\n(2)\nSignificant seismic anisotropy occurs in all parts of the western Japan subduction zone, including the crust, mantle wedge, the subducting Pacific and PHS slabs, and the subslab mantle. The subducting Pacific and PHS slabs exhibit mainly trench-parallel fast-velocity directions (FVDs), which may reflect the LPO of aligned anisotropic minerals as well as SPO due to normal faults produced at the outer-rise area near the trench axis. Trench-normal FVDs are generally revealed in the back-arc mantle wedge and the subslab asthenosphere, reflecting mantle flows due to the plate subduction.\n\n\n(3)\nLarge megathrust earthquakes nucleated in or around high-V, high-Q and low-\u03c3 patches, which may represent strongly coupled areas (i.e., asperities) in the megathrust zone. This feature suggests that structural heterogeneities in the megathrust zone, such as the subducting seafloor topography and compositional variations, control the nucleation of the megathrust earthquakes.\n\n\n(4)\nTeleseismic tomography revealed that the PHS slab has subducted aseismically down to ~450\u00a0km depth. The PHS slab exhibits significant lateral variations in its lithospheric age from 15 to 43 Myr in western Japan. These factors affect the seismic and volcanic activities in the region.\n\n\n(5)\nThe Beppu-Shimabara graben, an active rift zone in Kyushu, was produced by the joint effect of three factors: northward extension of the opening Okinawa Trough, westward extension of the Median Tectonic Line, and hot and wet upwelling flow in the mantle wedge beneath active volcanoes in north-central Kyushu.\n\n\n(6)\nThe generation of large crustal earthquakes is affected by structural heterogeneities in the crust and upper mantle, in particular, arc magma and fluids. Large earthquakes do not strike anywhere randomly, but only anomalous areas that may be detected by geophysical imaging.\n\n\n\nNote that the tomographic results shown here have different resolution scales and different amplitudes of velocity and Q anomalies. The resolution scale of a tomographic model is controlled by the ray density and degree of ray crisscrossing due to the uneven distribution of seismic stations and earthquakes used. The amplitude of velocity and Q anomalies is affected by damping and smoothing regularizations that are required for stabilizing tomographic inversions because of the uneven ray distribution in a study volume. Hence, the amplitudes of velocity or Q anomalies in a tomographic image should be interpreted carefully by considering the strength of damping and smoothing applied in the inversion as well as the resolution scale of the tomographic model. Recently, Wang and Zhao (2019a, 2019b) conducted tomographic inversions for 3-D seismic velocity, Q and anisotropy using a limited-memory Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno algorithm for bound constrained optimization (Zhu et al., 1997; Morales and Nocedal, 2011). Because damping regularization is not required in this inversion scheme, the obtained tomographic results are less affected by human subjectivity, and the amplitude of velocity and Q anomalies and the strength of seismic anisotropy can be better retrieved. Hence, this new approach seems better than the existing inversion schemes (e.g., the widely-used LSQR algorithm by Paige and Saunders, 1982) to resolve the tomographic problems, in particular, for attenuation tomography because Qp and Qs values vary in a wide range (e.g., 1 to 2000), as shown by Wang and Zhao (2019a).\nFuture advances of seismic imaging mainly depend on the progress in seismic instrumentation, because the data coverage determines the first-order features of seismic images. Most of the permanent seismic stations are installed on the Japanese land areas, whereas there are few seismic stations in the Pacific Ocean and the Japan Sea. Gradual deployment of seismometers on seafloor will be the most important task for seismologists from now. Installing a dense permanent or portable OBS (ocean bottom seismometer) network in the Japan Sea will be necessary to resolve important geodynamic issues, such as the fate of the subducting Pacific and PHS slabs, the fine structure and convection in the big mantle wedge (BMW), the mechanism of deep earthquakes, and the back-arc spreading and intraplate magmatism. A joint use of the OBS data and the land-based network data will result in much better tomographic images. To have a thorough understanding of the structure and dynamics of subduction zones, updated findings of other branches of Earth sciences are needed, such as geology, geochemistry and mineral physics, which would be helpful to better interpret the seismological results.\n\n","270":"","271":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nClassical concept of the movement of forearc at convergent plate boundaries during a seismic cycle is the alternation of slow interseismic landward movement and sudden coseismic trenchward movement. The interseismic movements reflect interplate coupling that accumulates strain toward the next interplate earthquakes. Space geodetic observations since 1990s revealed the existence of a transient postseismic stage, i.e. forearcs move slowly trenchward during the early part of the seismic cycle (e.g. Wang et al., 2012). They are caused by postseismic processes such as afterslip (e.g. Heki et al., 1997) and viscous relaxation of asthenosphere (e.g. Ozawa et al., 2004). Recent advent of sea floor geodesy revealed postseismic landward motion of the oceanic lithosphere near the Japan Trench after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0), which is considered a part of the viscous relaxation (Sun et al., 2014).\n\nHeki and Mitsui (2013) reported unexpected increase of the landward movements of forearc GNSS stations in segments adjacent along-strike to the megathrust rupture after the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake (Mw 8.3), and possibly after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Fig. 1\n). General features of this phenomenon are illustrated in Fig. 2\n. After earthquakes, GNSS stations near the ruptured fault would move trenchward (Fig. 2b). In addition to it, Heki and Mitsui (2013) found that stations on segments adjacent to the ruptured fault showed landward increase of movements as illustrated with green arrows in Fig. 2b. This looks as if interplate coupling in the neighboring segments of the rupture has increased.\nThis phenomenon cannot be explained by classical viscoelastic relaxation. Fig. 3\n shows coseismic jump and slow movements caused by postseismic viscous relaxation calculated for a simple thrust earthquake case following Fukahata and Matsu'ura (2005, 2006). Postseismic deformation continues as the shear stress within viscous asthenosphere decays and let the deformation pattern reach the final state realizing the two-dimensional mechanical equilibrium within the lithosphere. Fig. 3b demonstrates that postseismic viscoelastic relaxation generates only trenchward movement of forearc GNSS stations. In other words, landward increase of velocity as seen for station X in Fig. 2 does not occur in the adjacent segments. This situation remains similar even with different settings of parameters, e.g. elastic thickness, viscosity of underlying asthenosphere, geometry of the fault. So, the postseismic acceleration of landward velocities as shown in Fig. 2b would need an explanation with some other mechanisms.\n\nMavrommatis et al. (2014) suggested that the increased coupling in the northernmost Honshu after the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake (Segment 3 in Fig. 1b of Heki and Mitsui, 2013) reflects the termination of the afterslip of the 1994 Mw 7.6 Sanriku-oki earthquake (Heki et al., 1997). This, however, does not explain the landward velocity increase seen at the neighboring segment on the other side (Segment 1 in Fig. 1b of Heki and Mitsui, 2013) of the 2003 Tokachi-oki rupture. Small-scale change of interplate coupling can be explained by the pore fluid pressure changes associated with coseismic fluid migration along the plate interface (Materna et al., 2019). However, rapid fluid migration that enable coseismic enhancement of interplate coupling over hundreds of kilometers has never been found or predicted.\nTo explain the postseismic increase of landward velocity, Heki and Mitsui (2013) hypothesized that the coseismic stress drop modified the force balance acting on the slab around the ruptured segment and induced accelerated subduction of the oceanic plate (Anderson, 1975). As a seismological evidence, Uchida et al. (2016) found accelerated interplate creep rates from slip accumulation rates of small repeating earthquakes beneath the Kanto area following the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. Outside NE Japan, Melnick et al. (2017) found the increased landward velocity also in Chile, at GNSS stations located to the north of the 2010 Maule earthquake (Mw 8.8) rupture. Melnick et al. (2017) called it super-interseismic period that occur at the early stage of an earthquake cycle, and Loveless (2017) considered it a common phenomenon after megathrust earthquakes.\n\nMelnick et al. (2017) suggested that this enhanced landward velocity might have triggered the 2015 Illapel earthquake (Mw 8.3) and the 2016 Chilo\u00e9 earthquake (Mw 7.6) that occurred to the north and south of the Maule rupture, respectively. Heki and Mitsui (2013) considered the accelerated subduction may account for temporary increase of regional seismicity such as the sequences of megathrust earthquakes in 1950s\u20131960s in Kamchatka-Aleutian subduction zones (Kanamori, 1978). Considering the large along-trench extent of these earthquakes, it would be difficult to explain such enhanced seismicity just as static stress perturbations (King et al., 1994).\nThe scope of the present study is to explore similar examples worldwide, taking advantage of the rapid expansion of GNSS networks in various subduction zones, using station coordinate data covering periods before and after megathrust earthquakes. We then try to find common features and discuss if the compiled data support a certain model, e.g. the slab acceleration model by Heki and Mitsui (2013).\n\n\n2\nData and methods\n\n2.1\nGNSS data and station selection\nWe analyze GNSS data that are available in forearc regions of subduction zones such as the western Sumatra, the NE Japan, the central and northern Chile, and the Oaxaca region, Mexico (Fig. 1). In Japan, we use the daily coordinates of the F3 solutions of the GNSS Earth Observation Network (GEONET) stations provided by Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (Nakagawa et al., 2009). For the 2003 earthquake, we followed the procedure by Heki and Mitsui (2013) and fixed the Kamitsushima station, north of Kyushu, and compared the velocity difference before and after the earthquake. For the 2011 earthquake, the Kamitsushima station, ~1000\u00a0km away from the epicenter, exhibited a few mm\/yr postseismic movements. Hence, we did not fix any stations and subtracted the movement of the landward plate calculated with the nnr-MORVEL56 plate motion model (Argus et al., 2011) from the coordinate changes in the F3 solution expressed in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).\nIn Sumatra, we analyzed the data from the Sumatran GPS Array (SuGAr) stations provided by Bandung Institute of Technology (Ardika et al., 2015). These data are processed using the GAMIT 10.5 to obtain daily solutions (Herring et al., 2018). For the South and Middle American data, we analyzed the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solutions available from the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (Blewitt et al., 2018) and partly from Jet Propulsion Laboratory at sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov\/post\/series.html. These movements within ITRF were converted to those relative to the landward plate using the nnr-MORVEL56 model. Because we discuss the change in velocity before and after earthquakes, common bias to these velocities are cancelled, i.e. the present study is not so sensitive to the selection of the plate motion model.\nHere we are interested in the change of crustal velocities in the forearc region of the segment adjacent along-trench to the megathrust ruptures (stations with green arrows in Fig. 2b). Therefore, we have to avoid GNSS stations suffering from postseismic trenchward movements (stations with black arrows in Fig. 2b). They are caused by afterslip and viscous relaxation of asthenosphere, and those for individual earthquakes are well documented in literatures such as Yamagiwa et al. (2014) for the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, Miyazaki et al. (2004) for the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake, Klein et al. (2016) for the 2010 Maule earthquake, Hoffmann et al. (2018) for the 2014 Iquique earthquake, and Lubis et al. (2013) for the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake. To select stations showing landward velocity changes, we see not only the polarities of trench-normal velocities but also the distance of stations from the fault edge. This is because the phenomena we study tend to occur in a certain range of distance, i.e. they occur in forearc from the fault edge over a distance comparable to a half of the fault length. This will be discussed later in Section 5.3.\nIn calculating the velocity changes of the selected GNSS stations, we compare velocities during the two periods before and after the earthquakes (Table 1\n). These periods should be long enough to enable estimation of accurate velocities (longer than two years to robustly remove seasonal changes) and hopefully be immediately before and after earthquakes. Actually, we often have to shift or shorten these periods to avoid unwanted transient movements caused by other smaller earthquakes during the studied periods.\nWe should note that landward velocity changes depend on the selection of time windows. For example, such velocity changes are often unstable during the first few years while postseismic transient movements continue. We will discuss this problem comparing velocities in different time windows in Section 5.3.\nWe also need to pay attention to past earthquakes in nearby segments. Large interplate earthquakes are followed by trenchward postseismic movements of GNSS stations lasting for years. Their temporal decay might leak into the postseismic landward velocity increases, the target of the present study. For the six earthquakes studied here, we discuss potential influences from such past earthquakes.\n\n\n2.2\nData related to earthquakes\nIn addition to the geodetic data, we downloaded data from US Geological Survey (earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/map\/) to draw slip distributions of the megathrust earthquakes. We also discuss changes in seismicity expecting positive correlation between relative plate velocities and seismicity (Ide, 2013). Here we try to detect increases in seismicity in the segment showing enhanced coupling after the 2011 Tohoku-oki and the 2010 Maule earthquakes. We downloaded data from the International Seismological Centre catalog (www.isc.ac.uk) with depth\u00a0\u2264\u00a060\u00a0km. We used the target events with magnitude body (mb) in the period from 2000\/01\/01 to 2017\/12\/1 in the region 41.5\u00b0 to 45\u00b0N, 143\u00b0 to 149\u00b0E for the Tohoku-oki case, and from 2000\/01\/01 to 2017\/12\/1 in the region 33\u00b0 to 27\u00b0S, 74\u00b0 to 70\u00b0W for the Maule case.\nBefore comparing seismicity, it is important to check the magnitude completeness (Mc) of the earthquake catalog. By applying the method by Wiemer and Wyss (2000), we plot the cumulative number of earthquakes versus magnitude to evaluate Mc. For the ISC catalog, we found Mc are 3.8 and 4.2 for the Tohoku-Oki and the Maule earthquakes, respectively. Then, we counted 1813 and 2066 earthquakes with Mb \u22653.8, and\u00a0\u2265\u00a04.2 for de-clustering process of the two earthquakes.\nTo compare seismicity changes by large earthquakes, it is also necessary to remove clustered earthquakes such as swarms and aftershocks from the catalog, e.g. by using a stochastic de-clustering method developed by Zhuang et al. (2004). This method discriminates seismicity into background and triggered events based on an epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model. Parameters estimated by fitting the ETAS models to the ISC catalog are listed in Table A1. After de-clustering process, 1331 and 761 events remained as background events for the 2011 Tohoku-oki and the 2010 Maule cases. We discuss changes in these background events later in Sections 4.1 and 4.3.\n\n\n2.3\nA diagram indicating the postseismic enhanced coupling\nIn Section 4, we show a set of figures as shown in Fig. 4\n, for each megathrust earthquake. We model the time series of the two horizontal components of a GNSS station coordinate considering linear trends, average seasonal (annual and semiannual) changes, jumps associated with antenna replacements (for GEONET stations), and coseismic jumps. In addition to these standard parameters, we estimate the coseismic changes in velocity (v\u2019-v). The velocities are expressed relative to the stable part of the landward plates of the subduction zones (Fig. A1). We also discuss possible existence of non-linear movements shortly after earthquakes and their influences in Section 5.3.\nWe first rotate the two horizontal axes (north and east) so that the two components coincide with the direction parallel with (red in Fig. 4a) or perpendicular to (blue in Fig. 4a) the interseismic movement of the station before the earthquakes (normally in the direction of the subducting oceanic plate). In the plot, we subtract the estimated average seasonal components. In the diagram, the coseismic increase of the landward velocity of a GNSS station appears as the positive change in the slope of the red time series (Fig. 4a). The blue (trench-parallel) component represents the change in the direction of the movement by the earthquakes. This is expected to be small. Both components often show coseismic jumps, but they are not the target of the present study.\nHere, we do not discuss vertical components because changes in vertical velocities are not significant as reported for the 2003 case in Heki and Mitsui (2013). This partly comes from intrinsic large uncertainty in determining the vertical positions. Fig. A2 shows that vertical velocities changes following the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake are insignificant and non-systematic in direction. The figure also shows the vertical coordinate time series of two Chilean stations before and after the 2010 Maule earthquake. They suggest it difficult to extract meaningful changes in vertical velocities by this earthquake.\nTo see the whole picture of the postseismic increase of interplate coupling, we need lots of stations deployed at various distances from the megathrust fault. Typically, postseismic trenchward velocities dominate near the fault. Then, landward increased velocities (enhanced coupling signature) emerge as we go away along trench from the fault (Fig. 2b). This enhanced coupling would then decay as we go farther away from the fault.\nIt is usually difficult to see them all due to the insufficient availability of GNSS stations along the forearc. In this study, we use multiple stations to represent the landward velocity change whenever possible. Nevertheless, we sometimes have to let just one station represent the increase of the landward velocity for certain earthquakes. In the discussion, we compile all the cases to extract common features so that we can discuss the physical model behind the phenomenon.\nFor very large earthquakes, postseismic velocity changes can occur in a continental scale as shown in Melnick et al. (2017) in South America following the 2010 Maule earthquake and in China following the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Shao et al., 2015). In this study, we focus on the velocity changes occurring near the ruptured faults.\n\n\n\n3\nSlab acceleration model by Heki and Mitsui (2013)\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to collect as much geodetic information as possible to facilitate the discussion on the model responsible for the postseismic landward change in velocities. We do not aim at proving a particular model, including the model by Heki and Mitsui (2013). In fact, there are attempts to explain postseismic landward velocity changes within the framework of viscous relaxation. For example, Melnick et al. (2017) reports results by a three-dimensional thermomechanical model to reproduce continental scale postseismic velocity changes. D'Acquisto et al. (2020) try to explain the observed changes as the elastic bending in a horizontal plane in response to the postseismic trenchward movement near the rupture area. Other models capable of explaining the observations may also emerge in future. Here, as one of the possibilities, we review the simple slab acceleration model Heki and Mitsui (2013) proposed to explain the landward increased movements in segments adjacent along-strike to a megathrust rupture.\n\nFig. 5a indicates the balance of forces acting on a subducting slab during an interseismic period. There, two down-dip forces, slab pull Fsp and ridge push Frp, are balanced with the two up-dip forces, side (partially bottom) resistance Fsr exerted by the surrounding asthenosphere and interplate coupling Fc at the plate interface. Fsr is proportional to the subduction speed u and we assume the resistance occurs in a thin low-viscosity layer at the slab surface. This is a two-dimensional model and the forces represent those working on a thin slice with a unit thickness.\nOccurrence of a megathrust earthquake would reduce the coupling from Fc to Fc\u2019, which would be compensated by the increase of the side resistance caused by the acceleration of the subduction speed from u to u\u2019. Let Fc-Fc\u2019 be the lost coupling (stress drop integrated along-dip), and it can be related to the slab acceleration u\u2019-u as follows.\n\n(1)\n\nFc\n\u2212\nFc\n\u2019\n=\nFsr\n\u2019\n\u2212\nFsr\n=\n\n\nu\n\u2019\n\u2212\nu\n\n\n\n\u03bcW\n\/\nd\n\n\nwhere \u03bc is the viscosity of the low-viscosity layer with the thickness of d, and W is the along-dip slab length (both upper and lower surface) where viscous braking works. Then, the acceleration u\u2019-u is expressed as.\n\n(2)\n\nu\n\u2019\n\u2212\nu\n=\n\n\nFc\n\u2212\nFc\n\u2019\n\n\n\nd\n\/\n\u03bcW\n\n\n\n\nFor the same subduction zone with uniform \u03bc, W and d, the acceleration u\u2019-u would be proportional to Fc-Fc\u2019. Larger earthquakes would accelerate the slab more strongly with a larger Fc-Fc\u2019. It is actually the product of the fault width (along-dip length) D and the stress drop \u0394\u03c3.\n\n(3)\n\nFc\n\u2013\nFc\n\u2019\n=\n\u0394\n\u03c3\n\nD\n\n\n\n\nUsing the average slip s\nav, \u0394\u03c3 can be expressed using the rigidity \u03bd as.\n\n(4)\n\n\u0394\n\u03c3\n=\n\u03bd\n\n\ns\nav\n\n\/\nD\n\n\n\n\nFor the same subduction zone, we assume \u03bd is the same. Then eqs. (3) and (4) suggest that Fc-Fc\u2019, and hence u\u2019 \u2013 u, scales with the average slip s\nav, i.e.,\n\n(5a)\n\nu\n\u2019\n\u2013\nu\n=\n\n\nd\u03bd\n\/\n\u03bc\nW\n\n\n\n\ns\nav\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the present paper, we compare cases in different subduction zones. It is generally difficult to infer diversity of parameters \u03bd, d, and \u03bc for different subduction zones. However, we can know W from seismological studies. In other words, by assuming that \u03bd d\/\u03bc is the same, we could examine if the observed slab acceleration u\u2019-u is proportional to s\nav\/W,\n\n\n(5b)\n\nu\n\u2019\n\u2013\nu\n=\n\n\n\u03bdd\n\/\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\ns\nav\n\n\/\nW\n\n\n\n\nIn Section 5.6, we examine if the observed velocity changes for different megathrust earthquakes in various subduction zones obey eqs. (5a) and (5b).\n\n\n4\nEnhanced interplate coupling after various megathrust earthquakes\n\n4.1\nThe 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0)\nThe 2011 March Tohoku-oki earthquake occurred as the result of subduction of the Pacific plate beneath NE Japan arc on the Okhotsk (or North American) plate at the Japan Trench. Its source region included areas with a range of M7 to M8 earthquakes during the last few hundreds of years prior to the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Tajima et al., 2013), and geodetic data both on land and seafloor revealed the extremely large slip extending to the shallow portion of the plate boundary (e.g. Iinuma et al., 2012). The large-scale postseismic deformation of this earthquake due to afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation followed the earthquake (e.g. Yamagiwa et al., 2015), and east-southeastward velocity of coastal stations of the Tohoku District, NE Japan, still continues in 2020 (mekira.gsi.go.jp). Heki and Mitsui (2013) found that the interplate coupling has increased following this earthquake in eastern Hokkaido, the segment to the northeast of the Tohoku-oki rupture.\n\nFig. 6a shows the difference of the velocities before and after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. There, the start time of the period to estimate postseismic velocity is shifted to 2012.0 to avoid the strong non-linear behavior of the early part of the postseismic time series. The movements of the stations are reasonably linear in this period, but possible influences of non-linear movements are discussed later in Section 5.4. We can see that trenchward postseismic movements prevail in the Tohoku District and the western half of Hokkaido. The eastern Hokkaido shows, on the other hand, the typical enhanced interplate coupling signature, i.e. the velocity changes are northwestward. In drawing velocities in Fig. 6, we converted the velocity in ITRF to the frame fixed to the Okhotsk plate using the nnr-MORVEL56 model (Argus et al., 2011).\n\nFig. 6b, c shows crustal movements before and after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake at ten stations 0519, 0512, 0009, 0125, 0531, 0010, 0112, 0138, 0015, and 0532 (from northeast to southwest). Because the postseismic trenchward movements of the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake still continued in 2011, their velocity vectors deviate significantly in azimuth from the subduction direction of the Pacific Plate. Nevertheless, as seen in Fig. 6a, the velocity changes at 2011.19 is clearly in the direction of the subduction, i.e. the pre-earthquake landward movement of the GNSS stations has increased after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake.\nIn Fig. 6d, we show the diagram similar to Fig. 4 for the station 0112, where the landward velocity increase of 8.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mm\/yr is seen. Such an error for the increase represents 2\u03c3. It is scaled with post-fit residuals but may underestimate the real uncertainty. For the cases with data available from multiple stations, we use the scatters of their increase to express their uncertainties for later discussions of the model. One large difference from the typical case (Fig. 4) is that even the component perpendicular to the subduction direction (trench-parallel, blue component in Fig. 6d) has significant slopes. This component simply reflects the continuation of the postseismic movement of the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake, and these slopes do not show any change by the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. Similar time series from two additional stations are given in Fig. A3. Change in seismicity in the region showing enhanced landward movements are discussed in Section 5.2. We also demonstrate that the postseismic movements of the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake are linear enough in 2008\u20132011 and its curvature does not influence the postseismic velocity change of the 2011 earthquake in Section 5.4.\n\n\n4.2\nThe 2003 Tokachi-oki Earthquake (Mw 8.3)\nThe 2003 September Tokachi-oki Earthquake occurred at the Kuril Trench off the eastern Hokkaido as a possible recurrence of the 1952 Mw 8.2 Tokachi-oki earthquake. Postseismic deformation signatures observed using the GEONET data are well documented (e.g. Miyazaki et al., 2004; Itoh and Nishimura, 2016). Heki and Mitsui (2013) found postseismic enhanced interplate coupling, for the first time, at the segments adjacent northeastward and southwestward to the ruptured segment after this earthquake.\n\nFig. 7\n shows the maps and diagram similar to Fig. 6 for the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake. We selected the GNSS stations with landward velocity changes located along the Pacific coast of the northernmost Honshu (stations with green vectors in Fig. 7a, 0153, 0156, 0158, 0162, 0027, 0539 from north to south). Fig. 7a, b shows interseismic velocities before and after the earthquake. Here we used the F3 solution and followed the procedures in Heki and Mitsui (2013), i.e., we fixed the Kamitsushima station, Kyushu, Japan, which is not much different from the frame fixed to the Okhotsk plate used for the 2011 earthquake (Fig. 6). In Fig. 7d, we show time series of the trench-normal (red) and trench-parallel (blue) components for the 0027 station. There we can see the increased landward movement of 5.3\u00a0mm\/yr. Similar time series from two additional stations are given in Fig. A4.\nAs reported in Heki and Mitsui (2013), we also found that the velocity in the trench-parallel direction (N9.0E) has also changed the rate by \u22124.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mm\/yr. This reflects the slight counterclockwise rotation of the velocity as recognized by comparing Fig. 7b and c. This might be due to postseismic viscous relaxation occurring as a slow movement away from the fault (together with the trenchward movement), which is visible in the numerical simulation results given in Fig. 3b. Similar outward movements are also reproduced by vertical axis crustal rotation in Melnick et al. (2017).\nAs described earlier, Mavromatis et al. (2014) suggested that this landward velocity change indicates the termination of the postseismic trenchward movement caused by the 1994 Mw7.6 Sanriku-oki earthquake (Heki et al., 1997). We do not think it a significant factor partly because their model does not explain the landward velocity change on the other side (easternmost Hokkaido) after the 2003 earthquake (Fig. 7a). In addition to that, we analyzed the velocity of 0027 prior to the 2003 earthquake. As shown in Fig. A7, the effect of postseismic transient of the 1994 Sanriku-oki earthquake remains dominant only until 1997\u20131998. We excluded data before 1998.0 in deriving the pre-2003 velocity (Fig. 7d), so that the postseismic transient of the 1994 earthquake do not affect the estimated velocity increases.\n\n\n4.3\nThe 2010 Maule Earthquake (Mw 8.8)\nFast convergence between the Nazca and the South American plates causes recurrent megathrust earthquakes along the Peru-Chile Trench off the Pacific coast of South America. The 2010 February Maule earthquake, one such event in central Chile, filled the seismic gap lasting since the 1835 Conception earthquake. In addition to the co- and postseismic crustal deformation of this earthquake reported in Vigny et al. (2011), Moreno et al. (2012), and Klein et al. (2016). Melnick et al. (2017) reported postseismic increase of the landward velocities of stations located to the north of the rupture. They suggested that such enhanced coupling may have triggered the occurrence of the 2015 Illapel earthquake (Mw 8.3) to the north of the 2010 rupture.\n\nKlein et al. (2016) reported large-scale postseismic oceanward movements of GNSS stations around the ruptured segment, and it can be seen in velocity changes by the 2010 earthquake in Fig. 8a. We also can see that stations located to the north of the 2010 rupture show clear signatures of enhanced interplate coupling (green vectors in Fig. 8a). The velocities of these GNSS stations before and after the earthquake are shown in Fig. 8b and c, respectively. Fig. 8d shows the horizontal movement in the direction parallel with (red) and perpendicular to (blue) the before-earthquake interseismic velocity of the CNBA station. The red component shows an increase of 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mm\/yr. It is interesting to see that the blue component shows the postseismic slow movement away from the fault, a feature also observed after the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake (Fig. 7d). The stations in Fig. 8b and c showing enhanced landward velocities, including CNBA, suffer from data gaps up to two years. Additional time series of two stations are given in Figs. A5. Change in seismicity in the region showing enhanced landward movements are discussed in Section 5.2.\n\n\n4.4\nThe 2014 Iquique Earthquake (Mw 8.2)\nThe 2014 April Iquique earthquake occurred at a segment near the Peru-Chile border. This segment has been known as the north Chilean seismic gap with the last rupture by the 1877 Iquique earthquake (Mw 8.6) (Kelleher, 1972). Postseismic trenchward movements occur near the ruptured fault as the combined effect of the afterslip and the viscoelastic relaxation (Hoffmann et al., 2018). Fig. 9a suggests that the stations located to the south of 21S, as well as one station AREQ to the north, are not affected by such postseismic trenchward movements.\n\nFig. 9d shows the SRGD station to the south of the rupture, showing small landward velocity increase of 2.8\u00a0mm\/yr by the 2014 earthquake. On the northern side, AREQ shows the increase of 1.6\u00a0mm\/yr (Fig. A6). Both SRGD and AREQ stations are located at distances comparable to the fault length from the SE and NW edges of the fault.\nLarge interplate earthquakes occurred recently around the 2014 Iquique earthquake. To the north, the southern Peru earthquake (Mw 8.4) occurred near Arequipa in 2001, being followed by postseismic deformation continuing for at least two years (Perfettini et al., 2005). The rupture area of the 2001 earthquake seems to be coupled again a decade after the earthquake (Villegas-Lanza et al., 2016). We expect that the increasing of landward velocity at AREQ station after 2014 was not much influenced by the decay of the postseismic movement of the 2001 event.\nTo the south, the 2007 Tecopilla earthquake (Mw 7.7) (Schurr et al., 2012) and the 1995 Antofagasta earthquake (Mw 8.1) (Pritchard et al., 2002) did not significantly change the slip deficit in the studied region. Strong interplate coupling is confirmed in the 2014 Iquique earthquake focal region prior to the earthquake (M\u00e9tois et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015). Hence, we think the influences from the postseismic movements of these earthquakes to the landward velocity change following the 2014 Iquique earthquake are small.\n\n\n4.5\nThe 2007 Bengkulu Earthquake (Mw 8.4)\nThe 2007 September Bengkulu earthquake occurred within the southern Sumatra subduction zone as the result of the oblique convergence of the Indo-Australian and the Eurasian plates. This region has been suffering from recurrent large earthquakes for a long time, with a series of large interplate earthquakes occurring since the 2004 December Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (Mw 9.2). Such earthquakes include the 2005 March Nias earthquake (Mw 8.5), the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake (Mw 8.4), and the 2010 Mentawai tsunami earthquake (Mw 7.9). In the past, similar megathrust earthquakes may have hit this area in 1797 and 1833 as inferred from studies of coral microatolls (Natawidjaja et al., 2006). We use the GNSS data of the MLKN station, one of the SuGAR (Sumatra GPS Array) station in the Enggano Island, to compare the velocity before and after the 2007 earthquake.\nAs seen in Fig. 10a, stations on the rupture and on the northwestern segment show large trenchward postseismic movements. On the other hand, MLKN shows northeastward velocity change by the 2007 earthquake. An unusual situation for this station is that its interseismic velocity is not in the direction of the subduction. As seen in Fig. 10b and c, which compare velocities before and after the 2007 earthquake, the station moves northwestward. This reflects the continuation of the postseismic movement of the 2000 Enggano earthquake (Mw 7.9), whose fault plane is indicated with a red rectangle (Abercrombie et al., 2003). In spite of this situation, the velocity change of MLKN in 2007 coincides with the plate subduction direction. Hence, we think it an example of the postseismic landward velocity changes studied here. The end of the postseismic period is taken at 2010.81, the occurrence time of the Mentawai earthquake, a Mw 7.9 typical tsunami earthquake that occurred close to the 2007 rupture (Satake et al., 2012). MLKN clearly shows the increase of the landward velocity at this segment.\nWe found the velocity change in the trench-normal component of 5.1\u00a0mm\/yr following the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake (Fig. 10d). Unlike other cases, MLKN is located quite close to the southeastern edge of the fault of the 2007 earthquake. In this earthquake, the afterslip occurred mainly in the northwest part of the fault, which made the postseismic signals weak at MLKN. Lubis et al. (2013) calculated postseismic crustal movements of the 2007 earthquake by the viscoelastic relaxation, and the results showed insignificant movement around the MLKN station, and this support our interpretation that the velocity change of MLKN comes from the landward increased velocity of the 2007 earthquake.\nThis region is thought to be a part of the Sunda Strait seismic gap. Mignan et al. (2006) suggested that this area has remarkable accelerated seismic moment release similar to the area where maximum slip occurred during the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. Hanifa et al. (2014) pointed out that the region off the southwestern coast of Java is a seismic gap with a high probability of future earthquakes. The enhanced coupling after the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake might contribute to accelerated strain accumulation in those segments.\n\n\n4.6\nThe 2012 Oaxaca Earthquake (Mw 7.4)\nRecurrent large earthquakes in southern Mexico are due to the subduction of the Cocos plate beneath the southernmost part of the North American plate along the Middle America Trench. Several significant earthquakes occurred in the region near the 2012 March Oaxaca earthquake, e.g. the 1932 Mw 7.9 earthquake, the 1995 Mw 8.0 earthquake, and the 1985 Mw 8.1 earthquake (Kanamori et al., 1993; Courboulex et al., 1997). For this earthquake, we could find only one station suitable for the present study, the OXPE station, (Figs. 11a,b) with meaningful time span before and after the earthquake near the 2012 rupture. Our result showed a small increase of the landward component of the horizontal velocity of 4.1\u00a0mm\/yr (Fig. 11c). This station is located at a distance comparable to the fault length from the SE edge of the fault.\nIt is difficult to know if earthquakes before the 2012 Oaxaca earthquake influence landward velocity change because of the lack of enough GNSS data. The last major earthquake that occurred near the OXPE station, is a 1999 M7.5 earthquake (Segou and Parsons, 2018). Considering the time between the two earthquakes, the decay of its postseismic crustal deformation would not significantly influence the results shown in Fig. 11.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nOverview of the six cases\nWe reported six cases in four different subduction zones suggesting the post-earthquake occurrence of landward increase of velocity on the segments adjacent along-strike to the ruptured segment. They are not easily explained by conventional interpretations with postseismic processes such as afterslip and local scale viscous relaxation. We first revisited the 2003 Tokachi-oki and the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquakes in NE Japan reported by Heki and Mitsui (2013). We then studied the 2010 Maule earthquake, Chile, for which Melnick et al. (2017) reported increased landward movements north of the rupture. We also studied the velocity changes associated with the 2014 Iquique earthquake in northern Chile, originally found by Hoffmann et al. (2018). We newly found the signatures for the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake (Southwestern Sumatra), and the 2012 Oaxaca earthquake (Mexico).\nThe six examples include the two cases, 2011 Tohoku-oki and 2007 Bengkulu earthquakes, where interseismic velocities deviate largely from relative plate subduction directions. Such deviations are due to long-lasting postseismic crustal movements of past earthquake, i.e. 2003 Tokachi-oki and the 2000 Enggano earthquakes, respectively. Even in these cases, the velocity changes nearly align with the plate subduction directions. We also carefully evaluated the leakage of the decaying trenchward postseismic crustal movements of past large nearby earthquakes into the inferred landward velocity increases.\nIn addition to landward velocity increase, a trench-parallel velocity change was found after the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake. Also, in the 2010 Maule earthquake, the changes of the velocities are somewhat deviated counterclockwise from the plate subduction direction (Fig. 8a). Such changes could be driven by postseismic viscous relaxation. Vertical velocities may also have changed at stations showing enhanced landward velocities. Because of the larger noises in vertical component, we cannot draw decisive conclusions for them (Fig. A2). We will revisit the problem after we obtain data with enough time span.\nIn addition to the six cases studied here, we looked for similar increase signatures for other megathrusts in various subduction zones. They include the 2004 December Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (Mw 9.2) and the 2005 March Nias earthquake (Mw 8.6) (Fig. 1). We were unsuccessful in these cases simply due to the lack of enough time span of pre- and postseismic data from GNSS stations in appropriate places. The movements of the SuGAR stations are well documented by e.g., Feng et al. (2015). Below we summarize the situation.\nThe three SuGAR stations (PSMK, PTLO, PBAI) in islands to the northwest of Sumatra started working well before the 2004 earthquake and may have recorded enhanced landward velocities following that event. However, the 2005 March earthquake occurred before we can confirm its signature, and their velocity changed trenchward due to the postseismic movements by the 2005 event. Three SuGAR stations (MSAI, PSKI, BSAT) off the middle Sumatra started operation before 2004, but they were not close enough to the 2005 rupture and did not show significant post-2005 landward velocity change. We think it likely that these two earthquakes caused landward velocity increases in this subduction considering possible triggering of earthquakes in adjacent segments (Haridhi et al., 2018), e.g., the 2005 Nias earthquake to the southeast of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, and the 2010 Mentawai earthquake and the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake further to the southeast. It is a pity that we could not confirm this by geodetic data.\nA similar situation applies for the 2015 Illapel earthquake (Mw 8.3), in central Chile (Fig. 1). For example, the COPO station is in the region suitable to study increased coupling by the 2015 earthquake, but its observation data are not available after 2015.\n\n\n5.2\nIncreased seismicity\nIf such a landward velocity change in the neighboring segments of the megathrust ruptures is related to the enhanced trench-normal shortening rate, shear stress buildup would also increase there. To confirm this as increased seismic activity (Uchida et al., 2016; Ide, 2013), we compared seismicity before and after the megathrust earthquakes in those segments (Figs. 12, A8, A9\n).\nIncreased seismicity right after the 2011 Tohoku-oki in the Pacific coast of eastern Hokkaido is difficult to confirm. This is due to the temporary increase of seismicity that started a few years before the 2011 earthquake (gray region in Fig. 12c). This increase is not due to aftershocks because of the lack of significant earthquakes in this period (Fig. A8). This increase is considered an artifact (K. Katsumata personal comm. on 2020\/9\/11) with possible origins including the change in detection capability (Habermann, 1991), natural change in background seismicity (background fluctuation), and the ETAS problem itself (Lombardi et al., 2010). Here we shifted the periods before and after the 2011 earthquake to exclude the gray area in Fig. 12c. This let us see the increase in seismicity possibly caused by the enhanced coupling associated with the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Fig. 12c).\n\nFigs. 12d shows the increase of seismicity from the two- and four-year periods before and after the 2010 Maule earthquake, respectively, within the rectangles shown in Fig. 12b. There we show the number of earthquakes, and we can see an increase in seismicity of ~10%, which is smaller than the rate of increase in landward velocity (~20% in CNBA, see Fig. 8). In both the Japanese and Chilean cases, the rates of the seismicity increases are not so high as those in the rates of the increased landward velocities.\n\n\n5.3\nSpatial decay of the enhanced coupling\nThe enhanced coupling may encourage future failures in the neighboring segments. For example, earthquakes such as the 2015 Illapel earthquake (Mw 8.3) and the 2016 Chilo\u00e9 earthquake (Mw 7.6), occurred to the north and south of the 2010 Maule earthquake, respectively, may have been triggered by the enhanced coupling caused by the 2010 Maule event (Mw 8.8) (Melnick et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2017). To further discuss this issue, it is important to know the spatial and temporal decay of the enhanced coupling.\nIn Section 4, we did not pay much attention to the relationship between amounts of the velocity changes and distances from the ruptured faults. In Fig. 13\n, we plot the landward velocity increases as a function of the distance from the center of the fault for the 2003 Tokachi-oki, 2011 Tohoku-oki, and the 2010 Maule earthquakes. For the Tohoku-oki case, postseismic trenchward movements seem to prevail from the rupture area as far to the northeast as ~100\u00a0km from the fault edge. According to the slab acceleration model (Section 3), this does not mean the absence of slab acceleration there. The acceleration is the largest just beneath the ruptured fault, but it is \u201chidden\u201d by the oceanward movement of the forearc caused by the afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation.\nFor the 2011 Tohoku-oki case, the landward velocity changes prevail for stations farther than ~100\u00a0km from the fault edge. Such an increase is confirmed to continue as far as ~650\u00a0km from the fault center, but it is not clear if it extends beyond that point due to the lack of data. For the 2010 Maule case, we have data only beyond 500\u00a0km from the fault center. Probably, the true maximum landward velocity increase for this event would exist somewhere with distance <500\u00a0km. For this earthquake, the data are available as far as 800\u00a0km, and the velocity increases seem to decay gradually for distance range 500\u2013800\u00a0km. For the 2003 Tokachi-oki case, landward increase appears in the stations closer to the fault, and its maximum occurs only ~100\u00a0km from the fault edge. From these three cases, the landward velocity increase seems to extend at least as far as ~1\/2 the fault lengths beyond the fault edges.\nIf such a landward velocity increase is associated with the increased interplate coupling, large earthquakes may be encouraged in the future in \u201caffected segments,\u201d e.g., the southern Kuril Islands and central Chile. It would be reasonable to consider that the enhanced interplate coupling to the north of the Maule rupture has triggered the 2015 Mw 8.3 Illapel earthquake (see Fig. 13c for position). Luo et al. (2020) recently proposed that the 2010 Maule and the 2016 Chilo\u00e9 earthquakes might be related to the enhanced coupling starting a few years prior to 2010 in the rupture area of the 1960 Chile earthquake. This suggests spatial and temporal complexity of the triggering problem.\nD'acquisto et al. (2020) used the velocity-driven 3D mechanical finite element models to quantify and analyze the deformation that produces landward motion by the viscous relaxation of the mantle wedge and the deep afterslip. Their results show increased postseismic landward motion of up to ~6.1\u00a0mm\/yr at (trench-parallel) distances >450\u00a0km from the middle of the ruptured asperity. They conclude that enhanced landward motion is generated by in-plane elastic bending of the overriding plate and mantle wedge in response to oceanward motion of lithosphere around the rupture zones. Their results are also consistent with the observations in Central Chile. Melnick et al. (2017) used a large-scale three-dimensional thermomechanical model to simulate viscoelastic relaxation of the mantle to explain continental-scale velocity changes. Their model also reproduces the observed landward velocity increase.\n\n\n5.4\nTemporal decay of the enhanced coupling\nAnother important aspect is the temporal decay. According to the slab acceleration model (Section 3), The enhanced coupling decays as the interplate coupling Fc returns to the pre-earthquake state. Such a recovery time may depend on the earthquake magnitude, i.e. the larger the magnitude, the longer the period for the recovery of interplate coupling. In the time series of trench-normal movements (Figs. 6-11), temporal decays are not very evident, i.e. landward movements show simple increased linear trends without notable curvatures. Here we confirm this numerically.\nWe set up the moving 1-year time period for the linear regression to see possible temporal change in slope (Fig. 14\n). This analysis shows that velocity changes are either higher or lower in the first few postseismic years due to postseismic transients. Gray arrows in Fig. 14 indicate rough length of significant postseismic transients given in past literatures. After these years, the velocity changes seem to remain stable.\n\nFig. 15\n presents an example of a long-time continuous distance changes of a baseline in Hokkaido, connecting the 0010 and 0102 stations. This baseline is approximately in the direction of the Pacific plate subduction and the data covers from 1996 to 2020. The distance gets shorter as the interseismic compressive strain accumulates. This is disrupted by two interplate earthquakes in 2003 Tokachi-oki (Mw 8.3) earthquake and the 2004 Kushiro-oki (Mw 7.0) earthquake (Tanioka and Katsumata, 2007). After a few years of oceanward movement of 0010 (increase of the distance), distance resumed to decrease. The rate before and after these two earthquakes are 29.3\u00a0mm\/yr and 27.5\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively. After the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, this rate increased to 32.9\u00a0mm\/yr due to the enhanced landward movement of 0010.\nAn important feature in Fig. 15 is that the increased landward velocity does not seem to decay in time up to now. It shows temporary enhanced shortening for two years. After that, the baseline continues to contract at a steady increased rate up to now. Yamagiwa et al. (2015) showed that afterslip has mostly decayed in 2.5\u00a0years, while viscous relaxation continues over a longer time with a time constant of ~10\u00a0years. The increased landward velocity as seen in Fig. 15 would have a longer time constant. As already mentioned in Heki and Mitsui (2013), such an apparent lack of decay is a striking feature of this phenomenon, and we need observations over longer time windows to understand the process.\n\n\n5.5\nForearc station velocities and slab velocities\n\nHeki and Mitsui (2013) hypothesized that postseismic enhancements of the interplate coupling may reflect the accelerated rate of the slab subduction u\u2019-u in response to the modified balance of forces acting on the subducting slab (Fig. 5). Actually, what we observe is the change in velocity of forearc GNSS stations v\u2019-v, and we need to convert v\u2019-v to u\u2019-u. Generally, v becomes larger if interplate coupling is stronger, but v never exceeds u. We here inferred the ratio v\/u (0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0v\/u\u00a0<\u00a01) by comparing the observed interseismic velocity of the GNSS station and the subduction speed calculated by the MORVEL model (Argus et al., 2011).\nFor example, in the Maule earthquake, the velocity of the CNBA station observed before (v\nCNBA) and after (v'\nCNBA) the earthquake, is related to the hypothetical slab acceleration u\u2019Nazca\n-u\nN\nazca, using the subduction speed of the Nazca plate v\nN\nazca relative to the South American plate at the Chile trench, as follows,\n\n(6)\n\nu\n\n'\nNazca\n\n\u2212\n\nu\nNazca\n\n=\n\n\n\nv\nNazca\n\n\/\n\nv\nCNBA\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\nv\n\n'\nCNBA\n\n\u2212\n\nv\nCNBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis conversion is applied to all cases except the Tohoku-oki and the Bengkulu earthquakes. In these two cases, postseismic movements of nearby earthquakes in recent past still influenced v and v\u2019 (Figs. 6 and 10), i.e. the 2003 Tokachi-oki and the 2000 Enggano earthquakes, respectively. In Japan, we used the interseismic velocities before the earlier earthquake (i.e. before 2003). For the MLKN station, the data are not available before 2000, and so we used the average of interseismic velocities in 2000\u20132007 of the five stations above the 2007 rupture (Fig. 10a) to infer v\nMLKN.\nBy such calculations, the acceleration of the slab subduction for the six cases became, 22.0\u00a0mm\/yr (2011 Tohoku-oki), 8.4\u00a0mm\/yr (2003 Tokachi-oki), 10.4\u00a0mm\/yr (2010 Maule), 6.6\u00a0mm\/yr (2014 Iquique), 8.5\u00a0mm\/yr (2007 Bengkulu), and 10.1\u00a0mm\/yr (2012 Oaxaca). For the first four cases, we have data from multiple stations and calculated the uncertainties in such velocity changes.\n\n\n5.6\nComparison of the data with the slab acceleration model (Heki and Mitsui, 2013)\nHere we examine the slab acceleration model by Heki and Mitsui (2013) by comparing the acceleration of the subduction speed inferred in the previous section with the model predictions. The eq. (2) suggests that the decrease in the coupling F\nc\u2019-F\nc determines the slab acceleration u\u2019-u. The acceleration would hence depend on Mw, because a larger earthquake would cause larger F\nc\u2019-F\nc. Fig. 16\n compares de-trended time series of trench-normal movements of the forearc stations for the six cases studied here, using a unified vertical axis. The figure shows that the acceleration is larger for a case with a larger Mw, and the most significant velocity increase appeared following the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake.\nThe surface velocity changes v\u2019-v in Fig. 16 are converted to slab velocity changes u\u2019-u, as discussed in the previous section. Fig. 17a compares u\u2019-u in addition to v\u2019-v as a function of Mw. There, smaller symbols show v\u2019-v and u\u2019-u at individual stations for earthquakes where multiple stations are available. We can see that a larger earthquake brings a larger change, both forearc (v) and slab (u) velocities.\nAs discussed in Section 3, the loss of coupling Fc\u2019\u2013 Fc would be proportional to the coseismic slip averaged over the fault s\nav if we fix other parameters. Fig. 17b compares the slab acceleration with the average slip s\nav, calculated using the slip data of USGS as shown in Figs. 6-11. The acceleration seems to show good correlation with s\nav considering that the value for the 2010 Maule earthquake is an underestimate (Fig. 13d). However, it is not very clear if the two quantities are proportional considering the four earthquakes with Mw\u00a0\u2264\u00a08.5 are clustered at a down-left corner of the figure and do not contribute to the evaluation of the linearity.\nEq. (5) also suggests that the slab acceleration is inversely proportional to W, the length the slab surface. Here we assumed that W is twice as long as the slab lengths inferred from seismic tomography studies and compare u\u2019-u and s\nav\/W in Fig. 17c. Here we use the information on the lengths W, twice as long as the slab length, i.e. 1075\u00a0km for NE Japan (Deal and Nolet, 1999), 1100\u00a0km for Chile (Scire et al., 2017), 700\u00a0km for Sumatra (Hafkenscheid et al., 2001), and 900\u00a0km for Mexico (Husker and Davis, 2009). Noting that the value for the Maule event is underestimated, data in Fig. 17c suggest linearity. Nevertheless, they are not enough to provide a firm support to the slab acceleration model by Heki and Mitsui (2013), considering that 4 smaller earthquakes are clustered and do not fully contribute to the evaluation of the linearity. After all, the data obtained in this study support the model, but they are not strong enough to rule out other possibilities.\nThe dashed line in Fig. 17c has the slope of 6.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 yr\u22121, which corresponds to 1.93\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0s\u22121. This slope is equivalent to \u03bdd\/\u03bc in eq. (5) as the average of the four subduction zones studied here (although the 2011 Tohoku-oki and the 2010 Maule data mainly contribute to the determination of this slope). If we put 50\u00a0GPa and 1017\u00a0Pa\u00a0s into \u03bd and \u03bc, we get 380\u00a0m for d, the thickness of the low-viscosity layer at the slab surface.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nWe compiled GNSS data showing increased landward velocities that occurred in segments adjacent along-strike to six recent megathrust earthquakes in four different subduction zones (Fig. 1). Our results confirmed previous studies for the 2003 Tokachi-oki (Heki and Mitsui, 2013), the 2010 Maule (Melnick et al., 2017), and the 2014 Iquique (Hoffmann et al., 2018) earthquakes. We updated the case of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, studied briefly in Heki and Mitsui (2013), using GNSS data with longer time span. We found similar landward increase of velocity signatures for three more earthquakes in Sumatra, Chile, and Mexico subduction zones.\nFrom the case of the 2011 Tohoku-oki and the 2010 Maule earthquakes, we found that the landward velocity change extends to the distance comparable to the ruptured fault length (400\u2013500\u00a0km) from the fault center (Fig. 13d). Temporal decay was not clear suggesting relatively long-time constants of the phenomenon. We found moderate increase in seismic activities for the two largest earthquakes associated with the increased landward velocities. The velocity change showed a positive correlation with Mw and seems to scale with the average slip. This is consistent with the hypothetical slab acceleration model by Heki and Mitsui (2013) but does not rule out other possibilities. We consider that such landward velocity increase correlates with the enhanced interplate coupling in the adjacent segment, and the increased stress accumulation may encourage future earthquakes in segments influenced by the enhanced coupling, e.g., the eastern Hokkaido.\n\n","272":"","273":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Juan Fernandez Microplate (JFMP) is a small oceanic plate located in the Pacific region at the triple junction of the Pacific (PP), Nazca (NP) and Antarctic (AP) plates (Larson et al., 1992; Searle et al., 1993; Bird, 2003). The microplate extends for about 410\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0270\u00a0km, located at about 32\u201335\u00b0Lat S and 109\u2013112 Lon W (Bird, 2003) along the super-fast spreading East Pacific Rise. The discovery of the JFMP dates to the early 70s and is attributed to Herron (1972) and Forsyth (1972), who proposed its existence on the basis of the distribution of seismicity and focal mechanisms (Barazangi and Dorman, 1969; Forsyth, 1972; Anderson et al., 1974). The microplate was named after the Spanish explorer and navigator Juan Fern\u00e1ndez and the group of islands bearing his name (Craig et al., 1983), despite the fact that they actually lay more than 2000\u00a0km to the east. The JFMP is one of the largest microplates along the East Pacific rise and one among those located at a triple junction (Larson et al., 1992). The first mapping of its Eastern and Western ridges along the East Pacific Rise at 31\u201335\u00b0 Lat S (Craig et al. 1983) was later complemented by a first geophysical survey (Anderson-Fontana et al., 1986), including mapping of bathymetry and magnetic anomalies. Further surveys (Francheteau et al., 1987; Yelles-Chaouche et al., 1987) helped to reconstruct the divergent JFMP-NP and JFMP-PP plate boundaries (JFMP Eastern and Western Ridges, respectively): The Eastern Ridge experienced crustal accretion over the past 4 Myr, while the northern segment of the Western Ridge contains a large overlapping spreading centre (Larson et al., 1992). Combining local mapping with seismicity and slip vector information, the microplate outline and its Euler vectors could be defined (Anderson-Fontana et al., 1986). Since Euler poles lie on the JFMP or within a few hundred kilometers, a large rotational motion of the microplate has been inferred (Larson et al., 1992). The plate boundary database by Bird (2003) reports for the JFMP a Euler pole at 35.910\u00b0 Lat N, 70.166\u00b0 Lon E, with a rotation rate of 22.52\u00b0\/Ma after Anderson-Fontana et al. (1986) and plate boundary after Larson et al. (1992).\nIt is estimated that the JFMP formed about 4\u20136\u00a0Ma ago. Similarly to the neighbouring Easter Island Microplate, the JFMP kinematic has been described by a so-called \u201croller-bearing\u201d model (Larson et al., 1992; Searle et al., 1993; Bird et al., 1998), where the JFMP rotates quasi-rigidly with at least two Euler poles located in the close vicinity of the microplate boundaries and with small internal deformation. According to the roller-bearing model (Schouten et al., 1988), shear motion at microplate boundaries can apply a torque, which acts as driver for the microplate rotation. In such a model, the microplate is instantaneously in contact with bounding plates at two points, where the plate motions are tangential to the microplate outline. The tectonic history of the JFMP has undergone different phases, which have been reconstructed by Bird et al. (1998), experiencing an overall clockwise rotation. The microplate rotation was originally driven by a faster shear motion imposed by the PP and NP. However, the progressive decoupling from the PP and coupling to the AP resulted in the continuation of the clockwise rotation, but now driven by the NP and AP (Larson et al., 1992) and at a slower pace of ~22.5\u00b0\/Ma (Anderson-Fontana et al., 1986; Bird, 2003). Eastern and western boundaries of the JFMP are well delineated (Larson et al., 1992) and marked by strike-slip earthquakes (Global CMT). The East Ridge is propagating northwards and the West Ridge southwards, consistent with the prediction of the roller bearing model. The rotation is accompanied by formation of curved pseudofaults both inside and outside the JFMP; inner and outer pseudofaults have been mapped at the Western and Eastern Ridges, progressively growing and bending with the rotation of the microplate (Larson et al., 1992; Searle et al., 1993). Psuedofaults refer here to the traces of propagating ridge tips (Hey, 1977; Searle et al., 1993). East and West ridges appear segmented, with single segments varying 15\u2013135\u00a0km in length (Searle et al., 1993). On the contrary, the northern boundary is diffuse and predicted to be under compressional stress (Anderson-Fontana et al., 1986; Naar et al., 1991). However, no thrust earthquakes are known in the region prior to 2014. As for the East Pacific Rise section, which extends to the north of the JFMP until it meets the Easter Island Microplate, and is also relevant to our study, it has been suggested that it undergoes a cyclic contrary propagation and failure of two overlapping spreading centres, without the formation of an additional microplate (Hey et al., 1995; Martinez et al., 1997).\nThe first dedicated seismicity analysis (Sykes, 1967; Forsyth, 1972; Anderson et al., 1974; Anderson-Fontana et al., 1986), available for a few events in the study region, identified only strike-slip focal mechanisms. Nowadays, broader information is available for the following decades thanks to global seismic catalogs e.g. by Global CMT (Dziewonski et al., 1981; Ekstr\u00f6m et al., 2012) and USGS (https:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/, last accessed 1.7.2020), which provide hundreds of moment tensors at the JFMP boundaries. Looking at the distribution of hypocenters and focal mechanisms until fall 2014, the seismicity at the plate boundary is found to be discontinuous and to reflect the complex motion and the segmented boundaries of the microplate (Fig. 1\n); until 2014 the peak magnitude was Mw 6.5 (June 10, 1997). The JFMP rotation and shearing to neighbouring plates have been seismically accommodated by a majority of left lateral strike-slip earthquakes along transform segments of the microplate margins. NS oriented normal faulting dominates along the Eastern Ridge and at the southernmost part of the Western Ridge, next to the JFMP-PP-AP triple junction. Very few thrust mechanisms are observed, even at the northern JFMP boundary, which should experience local compression. Three low seismicity regions are found at the Northern (JFMP-NP) and Southern (JFMP-AP) microplate boundaries, and at the central segment of the Western Ridge (JFMP-PP).\nOn October 9, 2014, a Mw 7.1\u20136.7 seismic doublet (Mw 6.9\u20136.6 according to Global CMT) occurred close to the PP-NP-JFMP triple junction, but apparently within the microplate (Fig. 1). The two events in the doublet, occurring less than 20\u00a0min apart, are the largest ever recorded at the JFMP and the stronger one exceeds any previous earthquake in the region by half a magnitude. Also peculiar was the focal mechanism of the largest subevent, characterized, according to Global CMT, as a pure thrust mechanism. Here, we study in detail the rupture process of the doublet and its seismic sequence, by means of moment tensor inversion, waveform similarity, rupture directivity modelling, rupture geometry mapping and Coulomb stress analysis, to investigate their role in the framework of the JFPM rotational kinematics.\n\n\n2\nThe 2014 seismic doublet at the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez microplate\nThe seismic sequence started on October 9, 2014, at 2:14:42 UTC, with a Mw 7.1 earthquake striking at Lat 32.34\u00b0 S, Lon 110.81\u00b0 W (centroid location by Global CMT) in the Northernmost part of the JFMP (from now on referred as the first subevent). The Global CMT catalog reports a thrust mechanism oriented roughly ESE-WNW at a fixed shallow depth of 12\u00a0km and an unusually short (11.0\u00a0s) difference among hypocenter and centroid times, suggesting an impulsive earthquake with short rupture duration. Even accounting for the remoteness of the study region and the poor earthquake detectability (minimum magnitudes reported by Global CMT are above Mw ~5.5 before 1990, and above Mw\u00a0~\u00a05.0 in the period 1990\u20132006), thrust earthquakes are extremely rare in the region, and there are no reported cases of Mw 6+ with such mechanism in the region prior to 2014. Only 18\u00a0min later, at 2:32:14 UTC, a second earthquake occurred (hereon referred as the second subevent), with magnitude Mw 6.7; Global CMT reports a depth of 18\u00a0km, strike-slip mechanism and a centroid located about 25\u00a0km WSW of the first shock. The differential centroid-hypocenter time of 9.3\u00a0s is only slightly shorter than for the first subevent, besides from a significantly weaker magnitude. Unexpectedly for seismicity close to the mid oceanic ridge, the doublet generated a moderate tsunami: tide gages measured peak tide amplitudes of 47\u00a0cm at Easter Island, Chile, ~10\u00a0cm at Santa Cruz, Galapagos, Ecuador and at San Felix and Bahia Mansa, Chile, and <5\u00a0cm at Juan Fernandez, Chile (www.tsunami.gov, last visited 1.7.2020).\nThe doublet presents two uneven focal mechanisms, with a first, larger thrust event and a second strike-slip event: while seismic doublets with different focal mechanisms have been observed in the past (e.g. Ghods et al., 2015; Liu and Zahradn\u00edk, 2020), they remain relatively rare, especially for doublets of such large magnitude. Earthquake doublets and multiplets have been observed globally (Kagan and Jackson, 1999) and they have been studied to map stress heterogeneities at plate boundaries, and understand the behaviour of complex fault systems and earthquake triggering (e.g. Lay and Kanamori, 1980; Astiz and Kanamori, 1984; Lay et al., 2013; Zahradn\u00edk et al., 2017; Danr\u00e9 et al., 2019; Niazpour et al., 2020). Waveforms of the two earthquakes recorded at the closest broadband station on Easter Island (seismic station Rapa Nui, RPN, of the Global Seismograph Network - IRIS\/IDA (GSN) network, Scripps Institution Of Oceanography, 1986) are shown in Fig. 2\n. The difference among seismic signals, as well as different amplitude ratios among vertical (LHZ) and horizontal (LH1,LH2) components, are clearly visible both in the high and low frequency bands and are illustrative of the different focal mechanisms of the two subevents, despite their close locations.\nThe earthquake doublet was followed by a seismic sequence, with 13 additional events above Mw 4.4 reported (joint USGS and Global CMT catalogs) in the following week. Global CMT reports focal mechanisms for 9 of these aftershocks: surprisingly, all these solutions except one, propose strike-slip mechanisms well compatible with the second, weaker subevent, against a single thrust mechanism similar to the first, larger subevent. After a quiescence period of about 15\u00a0days, seismicity took over again North and Northwest of the doublet, with three earthquakes above magnitude Mw 4.9. In particular, a new doublet was observed on November 1, 2014, with a reversed sorting: first a strike-slip subevent (Mw 5.7, at 10:05:47 UTC), followed by a thrust subevent (Mw 6.1, at 11:00:00 UTC), and focal mechanisms according to Global GMT moment tensor solutions.\n\n\n3\nMoment tensor inversion and rupture directivity\nHere, we extend the source analysis of the seismic doublet by means of moment tensor (MT) inversion and rupture directivity analysis. Seismic sources of the aftershocks and the following seismic sequence, including the later doublet in November, are studied by a combination of MT inversion and waveform similarity analysis. Our aim is to confirm and extend previous seismological results to reconstruct the geometry of activated fault(s) and track the temporal evolution of seismicity. This analysis will also help the discussion of anomalous earthquake source parameters (e.g. unusual rupture duration) and aftershock productivity (e.g. rate of thrust vs strike-slip aftershocks).\nMoment tensor inversion has been first performed for the seismic doublet and for the largest earthquakes in the sequence using the Grond software (Heimann et al., 2018), based on seismic data at regional to teleseismic distances (Fig. S1). For the first subevent we simultaneously fit the following observations: (1) full waveform displacements on vertical, radial and transversal components (360\u00a0s time windows, bandpass 0.01\u20130.03\u00a0Hz) and corresponding amplitude spectra at closest stations (below 3000\u00a0km) II.RPN.10 and IU.PTCN.01, (2) P wave waveforms on the vertical component (60\u00a0s time windows, bandpass 0.02\u20130.05\u00a0Hz) and S wave waveforms on the transversal component (90\u00a0s time windows, bandpass 0.02\u20130.05\u00a0Hz) on the vertical components (both fitting amplitude spectra and cross-correlation in the time domain) for open broadband stations at a distance of 3000\u20135000\u00a0km. For the second subevent we used the same setup, except that we avoid using P waveforms at a far distance, as they overlap with the energetic signal of the first subevent. For the remaining studied events (i.e. those with Mw 5.5+) we follow a similar approach as for the first subevent, but use a slightly higher frequency ba2d (0.02\u20130.06\u00a0Hz for all observations), given the lower earthquake magnitudes. The selection of such a magnitude-dependent frequency band is not unusual (e.g. Ekstr\u00f6m et al., 2012) and driven by our wish to fit low frequency waveforms, which are less sensitive to the modelling of wave propagation in a simplified 1D model, while showing good signal-to-noise ratios. Synthetic seismograms and spectra are built for all inversions using a model with an oceanic crust (6.5\u00a0km thick, see Fig. S2) above an AK135 global mantle model, given that the majority of ray paths to seismic stations at regional distances or far distance to the Pacific coast of South America, Central America, Antarctica and Pacific islands mostly cross oceanic crust regions. We assume no isotropic component and invert for a deviatoric moment tensor. Note that the software Grond provides source parameter estimates with uncertainties, estimated by a bootstrap approach on the available data (Heimann et al., 2018). The main results of the moment tensor inversion are reported in Fig. 3\n (seismic doublet), Fig. 4\n and Table 1\n (whole sequence). Full data fits for the doublet are shown in the supplementary material (Figs. S3-S7).\nResults of the doublet are in general agreement with those of Global CMT: we obtain similar thrust and strike-slip mechanisms for the two subevents (fault plane angles are reported in Table 1), but estimate slightly larger magnitudes (Mw 7.1 and 6.7 for the two subevents, respectively) and slightly shallower depths (5.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9\u00a0km and 12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0km for the two subevents, respectively). Non-double-couple (non-DC) components are scattered and poorly resolved, providing no clear evidence for any reliable deviation from a pure DC model. We also invert for the rupture duration and obtain values of ~10 and 14\u00a0s, respectively. The short duration estimated for the first subevent is in very good agreement with the source time function by the SCARDEC database (Vall\u00e9e and Douet, 2016), which shows that most moment is released within the first 10\u00a0s, and confirms the unusual short duration of the first subevent, which is here found to be even shorter than for the second one, in spite of having a larger magnitude (Mw 7.1 vs 6.7). Moment tensor solutions, source parameters and example of waveform fits are shown in Fig. 3.\nMoment tensors are resolved for 5 more events in the seismic sequence with magnitudes in the range Mw 5.7\u20136.1, including three aftershocks in the first 30\u00a0h following the large doublet and the two events composing the later doublet on November 1, 2014: these include three strike-slip earthquakes, one oblique mechanism and one pure thrust. The November doublet is composed of a strike-slip mechanism followed (interevent time of less than 1\u00a0h) by a thrust event. All centroids are resolved at shallow depths, with strike-slip events consistently located slightly deeper (10\u201312\u00a0km) than thrust earthquakes (4\u20136\u00a0km), including the results of the first doublet. Results are in general agreement with those by Global CMT, except for one event (October 10, 2014, 4:07), where we resolve an oblique mechanism, apparently in between the strike-slip and thrust mechanisms of the October doublet, and Global CMT predicts a pure thrust faulting in agreement with subevent 1. Moment tensor solutions for weaker events are difficult to resolve due to their lower magnitude and the remote epicentral region. The closest stations (RPN and PTCN) are located at ~600 and\u00a0~\u00a02000\u00a0km from the doublet, and the next ones at more than 3000\u00a0km. We therefore follow a different approach to investigate the focal mechanisms of weaker events. Since all observations are at far distance of hundreds to thousands kilometers and since the seismicity occurs within a relatively compact region, a high waveform similarity can be used to detect events with a similar mechanism. The analysis, illustrated in Fig. 4, has been performed on selected stations\/components, chosen to have a low seismic noise contamination and where the waveforms of the two subevents of the doublet show significant differences, and thus it is easiest to differentiate among the two potential focal mechanisms. We performed a waveform cross-correlation among signals of weaker events and reference ones of the two subevents, allowing for time shift to account for slightly different ray paths and timing uncertainties. We finally identified similar waveforms, when the cross-correlation exceeded a threshold of 0.7; this value was chosen to ensure a high waveform similarity, while allowing for the classification of a large number of weak events. At the two closest stations, velocity signals recorded on the BH2 component of station RPN are very different for the strike-slip subevent 1 and the thrust subevent 2, and those on the BHZ component of station PTCN are almost anticorrelated. At a larger distance, BHZ traces at station RAR show a characteristic ringing signal for the strike-slip subevent, which is not present for the thrust subevent (note that similar ringing signals are indeed observed for both subevents, but for different azimuths, suggesting a kind of guided wave traveling over large distances, which is generated more efficiently for certain combinations of source geometries and azimuths). Comparing waveforms of the following events, we can easily classify most of the sources of the seismic sequence, confirming our moment tensor solutions and most of Global CMT ones. The only anomaly, again, is the oblique mechanism aftershock of October 10, where we now infer a predominant strike-slip component. Based on the joint interpretation of our MT solutions, Global CMT ones and the waveform similarity analysis we infer the focal mechanisms for 12 events in the sequence, including the original doublet: only two events present a pure thrust mechanism (subevent 1 of the October doublet and subevent 2 of the November doublet), while all others show similar mechanism and\/or waveform as the strike-slip subevent 2. For a few more events, we cannot infer any information on the mechanisms: these events are either occurring shortly after the main doublet or have a weaker magnitude, so that in both cases their signal is noisy and\/or overlapped with other strong signals.\nA full finite source inversion can hardly be performed here, given the lack of local stations. Instead, we try to resolve the main rupture directivity features, which can help to reconstruct the geometry of the doublet. Two approaches are tested, based on the analysis of apparent rupture durations and one comparing the hypocentral and centroid locations, respectively. The first approach (Cesca et al., 2011; L\u00f3pez-Comino et al., 2012, 2016) is based on the analysis of apparent rupture durations at different azimuths using P waveforms recorded at regional to teleseismic distances (Fig. 5\n). Although the network is asymmetric, with many stations located East of the epicentral region along the coast of South America, the availability of some stations on the Pacific islands, Antarctica and Central America helps to reduce the azimuthal gap. Unfortunately, this approach can only be used for the first subevent, because the P signals of the second subevent are in most cases overlapping with stronger S and coda signals from the first one. We calculated the normalized energy signals (square amplitude derived from the displacement) following the P-wave onset at different stations (Fig. 5a). The selected seismic stations show a good-quality recording in the P-phase with a maximum epicentral distance of 4961\u00a0km; note the closest station (RPN) is excluded from this analysis because its epicentral distance is significantly smaller than for all other stations and we prefer to use a homogeneous dataset. Despite the azimuthal gaps of 71\u00b0 and 88\u00b0 to the N and SW respectively, an azimuthal pattern is clearly observed in the raw waveforms and P-wave displacements, which can be identified by the delays of peak squared displacement of the P-phase (D2\nPmax). The largest delays of D2\nPmax, corresponding to the largest apparent durations, are found for stations located East and West of the epicenter, while the shortest delays (and apparent durations) are found towards the South. These delays are measured in the range from 5.0 to 9.0\u00a0s; they represent the apparent delay among nucleation and centroid times for the first subevents and are used to discuss and quantify the rupture directivity. Assuming a line source (Haskell, 1964), we consider pure unilateral, asymmetric bilateral and pure bilateral rupture models to find the best fitting with this observed data (Fig. 5c). Inversion yields similar L1 misfit (~0.4\u00a0s) for both unilateral and bilateral rupture models. However, the resulting rupture directivity towards NNE obtained by the unilateral rupture model appears incompatible with the two potential fault plane strikes identified in the previous MT analysis (Fig. 5b). A NNE rupture directivity could still be possible along the low dip plane, assuming a downdip propagation. Such type of rupture directivity has been observed for subduction earthquakes (e.g. Tilmann et al., 2016), but rarely in other tectonic contexts. Furthermore, considering the thin seismogenic volume at the JFMP, a downdip propagation would be constrained in size. This seems incompatible with the magnitude, duration and rupture length of this earthquake. Conversely, for a pure bilateral rupture model we find an azimuth of 254\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00b0 (WSW - ENE), which is consistent with the fault plane strike of 266\u00b0 (Table 1). In addition, this bilateral rupture model is defined by the maximum of two opposite unilateral Haskell sources yielding a centroid-origin time delay of 4.7\u00a0s (minimum value of the theoretical prediction). The total rupture duration is thus estimated as twice this value (9.4\u00a0s), because we consider the delay of DPmax as representing half of the rupture duration. The resolved rupture duration of ~9\u00a0s is in good agreement with the estimation of ~10\u00a0s by both our own moment tensor inversion and the SCARDEC database (Vall\u00e9e and Douet, 2016).\nThe second approach has been proposed by Zahradnik et al. (2008), in the so-called HC method, and it is based on the relative hypocentral-centroid location. A significant spatial offset among hypocenter and centroid implies a substantial rupture directivity and the relative location can be used, in favourable conditions, to reconstruct the fault orientation. Here we recollect hypocentral and centroid locations through the International Seismological Centre (ISC) bulletin (International Seismological Centre, 2020) and discuss the relative offset of the most robust locations, i.e. the prime hypocentral location by ISC, and the centroid location by Global CMT. Lateral uncertainties are reported by the ISC bulletin for the prime hypocentral location as ~5 and\u00a0~\u00a07\u00a0km for the two subevents. No location uncertainties are reported for the GCMT location. However, Smith and Ekstr\u00f6m (1996) reported that relative centroid CMT \u2013 hypocentral ISC location uncertainties may be in the order of 25\u00a0km and encourage the interpretation of relative location information to derive finite source information (e.g. length, directivity) only for large events (Mw\u00a0~\u00a06.5 and larger) and for relative locations larger than 25\u00a0km. The case of the 2014 JFMP doublet is described in Fig. 6\n. For subevent 1, we do not observe a large spatial offset among prime hypocentral location and centroid location, and other locations are quite scattered. In these conditions, the HC method does not allow a clear discrimination among true and auxiliary fault planes. This may be due to the bilateral rupture directivity, that we proposed based on the first approach, which would explain the relatively small offset among hypocentral and centroid locations. For subevent 2, all proposed hypocentral locations, including the prime location by ISC, lay NE of the centroid location. This suggests a predominantly unilateral rupture from NE to SW, thus clearly favouring the NE-SW fault plane. Both conditions posed by Smith and Ekstr\u00f6m (1996) for a safe interpretation of the analysis of relative hyopocentral-centroid locations are fulfilled for subevent 2, what supports our modelling and interpretation.\nJoining the different analyses we are able to reconstruct the geometry of the doublet and the evolution of the rupture processes, first bilaterally on an EW oriented thrust segment and then extending the rupture at its Western edge, with a unilateral rupture towards SW, with a strike-slip mechanism.\n\n\n4\nCoulomb stress transfer and earthquake triggering\nWe model the stresses due to the sub-events using constant slip elastic dislocations in a half-space (King et al., 1994; Nikkhoo and Walter, 2015). Values of the fault patch size, slip and direction are found in Tables 1 and 2\n (note rake is defined as the angle away from a pure thrust mechanism, in clock-wise direction when looking down onto the fault). Coulomb stress changes are calculated on planes with a pre-defined orientation and slip direction.\nWe now look at static stress changes in the area surrounding the observed events. Firstly, we look at how stress changed on the future fault plane of subevent 2 from the inverted slip of the first subevent (Fig. 7a). We find that the central and southwestern patch of the second subevent's fault plane is stressed such that left-lateral slip is promoted, while parts of the fault plane north of the first sub-event have a reduced tendency to slide. Overall, this is consistent with the Southward propagation of the rupture front derived by the kinematic modelling, with the rupture nucleating close to the fault planes intersection (highest positive Coulomb stress transfer) and then propagating towards SW, in the region where the slip is promoted.\nSecondly, we look at how the two sub-events affect the stress in the surrounding area (Fig. 7b). Specifically, along potential fault planes orientated optimally for thrusting. We aim to understand why there is a lack of aftershocks around the first subevent (Mw 7.1) with a similar thrust mechanism and also assess how Coulomb stress changes due to the doublet along neighbouring structures, potentially hosting future large thrust earthquakes. We find that after the doublet, the surrounding area is not stressed in a way that promotes thrust faulting to the north and south of the first events. This is true even further afield, where the compressional belt to the North, which is very large and potentially tsunamigenic, has a negative value of Coulomb stress change, and the smaller compressional segment to the NW affected by the November 10, 2014 thrust earthquake, which experiences a weak positive Coulomb stress change.\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nThe study region is quite remote and we lack a proper seismic network, with only one seismic station located at less than 1000\u00a0km distance and the majority of stations at thousands kilometers distance. These conditions pose high challenges to the seismological analysis, as regional data are ecsatoo sparse and seismic data at teleseismic distances has a good quality only for the largest events. We tackled these challenges by combining the results of earthquake source analysis, which provide robust results for the largest events only, with a careful assessment and modelling of weaker signals recorded at the few, available close stations (see also Cesca et al., 2020). Such relative earthquake characterization strategy, as well as the specific techniques used in this work, may be helpful for future studies dedicated to remote regions.\nOur seismological analysis allows us to reconstruct the evolution of the 2014 JFMP doublet and its seismic sequence, as illustrated in Fig. 8\n. The first phase (phase 1 in Fig. 8) of the sequence is characterized by the complex rupture of the October 2014 seismic doublet. The rupture started within the JFMP along an EW structure, an already mapped compressional ridge (Larson et al., 1992), and propagated bilaterally East and Westward. Based on the analysis of apparent durations, we suggest the Northward dipping plane as the rupture plane; this is also supported by the asymmetric slope of the ridge seen in the bathymetry, which shows a slightly more gentle slope dipping to the North, and a steeper one to the South (Fig. S8). The second subevent occurred after ~18\u00a0min, favoured by Coulomb stress changes imparted by the first subevent along a NE-SW oriented plane, with a strike-slip focal mechanism. The rupture along this second plane, or alternatively along a curved fault bridging the areas of the two events, most likely nucleated at the fault plane intersection and propagated unilaterally towards the SW, in the region which experienced a positive Coulomb stress perturbation after subevent 1. A number of aftershocks were observed in mid October (phase 2) at the sides of the rupture area of subevent 2; most of them are located to the SW, possibly as a consequence of the SW rupture propagation of subevent 2. In phase 3 seismicity slowly decayed and migrated Northward, activating strike-slip structures of different orientation (approximately NNW-SSE) and reaching the vicinity of a second compressional ridge (Larson et al., 1992). Phase 4 (November 2014) is again characterized by a doublet, now starting with a strike-slip mechanism and then continuing into an ~EW thrust earthquake. The spatiotemporal evolution of the sequence highlights the complex rupture interaction and interplay between thrust and strike-slip earthquakes; the two observed doublets display a reverse earthquakes interaction: a first thrust triggered a strike slip event in the October 2014 doublet, while the reverse process (i.e. strike slip-thrust interaction) is observed for the later, November 2014 doublet. We performed a stress inversion within the Northern region of the JFMP based on both the moment tensors of our study and references from other catalogs (i.e. as in Fig. 4). We use an in-house developed inversion, minimizing the radiated seismic energy (Cesca et al., 2016). We constrained the rupture plane orientations only for the first doublet and the early strike-slip aftershocks, which are aligned along a NE-SW pattern compatible with one of the fault planes, and we considered both possible planes for the remaining earthquakes. Our results indicate a predominant compressional regime, with \u03c31 oriented NNE-SSW. We found that \u03c32 and \u03c33 have similar values, so that minor stress perturbations can favour either thrust or strike-slip faulting, explaining the observed cohexistence of different rupture types and occurrence of mixed doublets. Such perturbations could arise from strength anisotropy in the oceanic crust. The latter exhibits a distinct spreading fabric with a preferred N-S to NE-SW orientation in the region affected by the seismic doublets as seen in high resolution bathymetry data (Ryan et al., 2009).\nThe 2014 JFMP doublet and its following sequence are peculiar due to several aspects: first of all they present outstanding magnitudes, with unprecedented recording in the region. The Mw 7.1 subevent 1 is the largest earthquake ever recorded at the JFMP and its thrust mechanism differs from the majority of the earthquakes in the region, which typically display strike-slip or normal faulting (Fig. 1). While the Northern boundary of the JFMP is considered to undergo compression, thrust mechanisms have been rarely reported there and never with large magnitudes. This observation suggests that regional compressional stresses are in large part accommodated aseismically, e.g. by creeping. Aseismic processes could explain the lack of thrust aftershocks in the 2014 sequence. However, the occurrence of two large shallow thrust fault earthquakes (Mw 7.1 in the October 2014 doublet and Mw 6.1 in the November 2014 doublet) demonstrates that the region can occasionally host strong, impulsive, tsunamigenic earthquakes.\nOther aspects of the thrust seismicity at the JFMP are also unusual. First of all, thrust earthquakes at JFMP show an extremely low aftershock productivity on the same fault: we could not detect any single thrust aftershock after the Mw 7.1 thrust earthquake, whereas the substantially weaker Mw 6.7 subevent 2, with a strike-slip mechanism, was followed by several aftershocks with a similar focal mechanism. This can be partially attributed to aseismic processes, as well as a low (if not negative) Coulomb stress loading on neighbouring thrust faults. The two thrust earthquakes also show an unusually short duration: this can be partially explained, at least for the first subevent of the October doublet, by its bilateral rupture propagation able to break a large segment (~45\u00a0km) in a relatively short time (10\u00a0s).\nWhile most of the previous seismicity at the JFMP displayed typical characteristics of interplate seismicity, with alternating between strike-slip and normal fauling segments along the JFMP boundaries, the 2014 sequence clearly occurred within the JFMP, even accounting for location uncertainties, which are below 10\u00a0km for hypocenters and ~25\u00a0km for centroids. We question whether the doublet activated the West Internal pseudofault (WIPF). The geometry of the activated fault segments resembles the proposed pseudofault lineament, but earthquake locations appear shifted to the North. However, the pseudofaults about the West Ridge are less clear than those on the East Ridge and the trace of the West Ridge inner pseudofault, in particular, is poorly resolved and obscured by volcanism (Larson et al., 1992). In these conditions, we suggest this is the activation of the inner pseudofault, but cannot verify this. Location and focal mechanisms of thrust earthquakes are also well compatible with the location and orientation of compressional ridges, and the sequence evolution suggests the consequent activation of different ridges migrating Northward from October to November: to date, the largest and Northernmost ridge, in the vicinity of the PP-NP-JFMP triple junction remains unbroken.\nIs there any tsunami hazard in the South Pacific, far from any subduction zone? The tsunami reported after the 2014 earthquake was relatively weak, with the largest run up height of ~50\u00a0cm at Easter Island at ~600\u00a0km distance. This tsunami is most likely to be attributed to the first subevent, which has a larger tsunamigenic potential due to both its larger magnitude, shallower centroid, impulsive source and thrust mechanism. The tsunami hazard should take into account the potential failure of other segments under compression. A large compressional ridge has been mapped at the Northern boundary of the JFMP (Larson et al., 1992), with a lateral extent of ~200\u00a0km, thus more than 4 times longer than the rupture of the October 2014 thrust, and a potential to host an earthquake with magnitude Mw ~8.1 (based on the empirical relation by Thingbaijam et al., 2017). It is worth noting that, according to Coulomb stress modelling (Fig. 7b), the 2014 doublet has inhibited or delayed a thrust failure of the Northern compressional belt. Assuming the same shear modulus and the same seismogenic thickness for thrust earthquakes in the region (i.e. same width for different thrust events), such potential earthquake would have a\u00a0~\u00a04 times larger area than the October 2014 one and\u00a0~\u00a035 times larger moment release. Using the following equation to relate scalar moment (M0), rupture area (A), average slip (\u03bb) and shear modulus (\u03bc):\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03bb\n2\n\n=\n\n\nM\n\n0\n,\n2\n\n\n\n\nA\n2\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nM\n\n0\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n0\n,\n2\n\n\n\/\n\nM\n\n0\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n1\n\n\n\n\nL\n2\n\n\/\n\nL\n1\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n=\n\n\u03bb\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n0\n,\n2\n\n\n\/\n\nM\n\n0\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n2\n\n\/\n\nL\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe estimate an average slip ~8 times larger than for the 2014 thrust (in eq. (1), subindices 1 and 2 refer to the reference Mw 7.1 subevent 1 and the potential Mw 8.1 earthquakes, respectively). Since we investigate the scenario of a thrust earthquakes with a similar mechanism and at a similar location and depth, the potential tsunami run up height would be at least ~8 times larger than for the 2014 event, thus reaching ~4\u00a0m at Easter Island, Chile, and almost 1\u00a0m at Galapagos, Ecuador, and at San Felix and Bahia Mansa, Chile, if the large unbroken thrust ruptures.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe 2014 seismic sequence struck at the JFMP with an unprecedented magnitude for the region, peaking in a Mw 7.1 earthquake on October 9, 2014 with a thrust focal mechanism, which is also unusual for the region. Besides the remoteness of this region, we combined different waveform based seismological techniques to analyse this seismic sequence. Rather than appearing as a simple mainshock-aftershock sequence, seismicity has been characterized by a complex sequence, including two doublets with an uneven mechanism, the Mw 7.1\u20136.7 thrust and strike-slip mechanism in October 2014 and a weaker, later Mw 5.9\u20136.1 strike-slip and thrust mechanism in November 2014. Apart from having a large magnitude, the seismic sequence was anomalous due to its alternation of strike-slip and thrust mechanisms, that indicates the activation of different faults or fault segments. Using a variety of seismological techniques to tackle the lack of local observations, we were able to reconstruct the chronology and geometry of this complex seismic sequence. This started with the large doublet, rupturing EW and NE-SW fault segments in the vicinity of a known compressional ridge, or alternatively a single curved pseudofault (WIPF). The following seismicity was first marked by strike-slip aftershocks of the first doublet and, later, by a Northward migration towards a second compressional ridge, where the second doublet occurred. We identified specific features of the thrust seismicity, namely low aftershock productivity, short duration and impulsive sources. Together with the overall low rate thrust seismicity, this suggests that the compressional stresses at the North of the JFMP are partially accommodated aseismically, with the occasional occurrence of thrust earthquakes. Thus, the sequence demonstrated that the region has a potential to host large, tsunamigenic earthquakes in the future. A worst case scenario, assuming the rupture along a 200\u00a0km long compressional ridge at the Northern boundary of the JFMP, could produce a\u00a0~\u00a04\u00a0m height tsunami at Easter Island. Coulomb stress changes imparted by the 2014 doublet have currently slightly reduced the failure potential along this ridge. The unexpected characteristics of the 2014 doublet and its seismic sequence indicate that we still poorly know the behaviour of the JFMP and its seismicity, and that a new local study and submarine seismic deployments would be desirable. Our study shines some more light on the occurrence of such complex seismic sequence in the region. As the roller-bearing microplate faults and step-over systems are often observed at oceanic plate boundaries, the occurrence of the JFMP seismic sequence provides a model for the generation of tsunamis at mid oceanic ridges.\n\n\nData availability\nSeismic data used in this study have been accessed using IRIS, Geofon and Orfeus web service portals.

(2015) and references therein). With increasing finite strain, the interconnectivity of phyllosilicates in layers and networks forms weak zones and results in an anisotropic rock texture along which deformation can easily localize (White and Knipe, 1978). This weakening enables slip along brittle faults, in the case of upper-crustal or rapidly deformed mid-crustal phyllosilicate-rich rocks (e.g. Torgersen and Viola (2014)) and somewhat wider localized shear in ductile shear zones (Passchier and Trouw, 2005). Among the suite of phyllosilicate minerals, white mica is of particular interest because of its suitability for radiogenic dating of crustal-scale deformation (e.g. (Torgersen et al., 2015a)). Moreover, white mica is stable under a wide range of metamorphic conditions, and it defines deformation fabrics, which are especially well pronounced in slates (Dunlap et al., 1991).\nThe isotopic K-Ar and 40Ar-39Ar systems of white mica have been widely used to date microstructures and tectonic events in brittle faults, shear-zones and folds (e.g. Fitz-Diaz and van der Pluijm (2013); (Torgersen et al., 2015a); van der Pluijm et al. (2006); Viola et al. (2013); Wang et al. (2016)). However, the Ar system is less well understood during diagenesis of low to very-low grade metamorphic slates due to complex microstructures and the individual chemical evolution of the K-bearing phases. In studies using multigrain separates, radiometric ages commonly reflect several mineral populations (Berger et al., 2017; Villa et al., 2014). The term \u2018recrystallization\u2019 as used in this paper includes static and dynamic recrystallization or neocrystallization (formation of new grains), by which re-equilibration of the initial geochemical composition results in (partial) \u2018resetting\u2019 of the chemical and isotopic composition (e.g., Clauer et al. (1997)). Other microphysical processes responsible for the final composition of micas on the retrograde path include: (1) (re)-precipitation of newly fine-grained white mica (Dempster, 1992), (2) dissolution-(re)-precipitation (Airaghi et al., 2017; Putnis, 2002) and (3) remnant grains. Berger et al. (2017) investigated these processes in mica along the retrograde path (Aar massif, Central Alps, CH). Until now, it is not clear what the contribution of each single process to resetting is and how these are expressed on the prograde path in phyllosilicate-rich systems, as for example in sediments of active accretionary wedges.\nThe K-Ar system of white mica is well suited to study the effect of recrystallization on the resetting process (Clauer, 2013). Using the K-Ar system, Pevear (1999) developed a method to quantify the detrital and diagenetic endmember ages for shales. Quantification of the different resetting processes (e.g. Airaghi et al. (2018); McDonald et al. (2016); Mulch and Cosca (2004)) is the missing link between multigrain isotope data and local in-situ microstructures and petrology. Therefore, we combine quantitative mineral separation with microstructures and isotope data to potentially link grain sizes, microstructures and isotope data and identify the correlation with the mineral chemistry of the selected minerals. Knowledge on such resetting processes is of great importance because dehydration is thought to represent one of the important processes in resetting the Ar system (Bosse and Villa, 2019; Villa and Hanchar, 2013). Independent evidence for high fluid contents is the intensity of veining (Akker, 2020: Dielforder et al., 2015), which itself also plays an important role in triggering seismic activity in such highly active geodynamic domains (e.g. Dielforder et al. (2016); Dielforder et al. (2015); Moore and Saffer (2001); Zwingmann et al. (2019)).\nHere, we investigate the behaviour of white mica in sequence of deformation and temperature in metasediments on the prograde path, specifically during the evolution of pervasive cleavage formation in slates. We use the Flysch units of the Glarus Alps (Central Switzerland) as an exhumed example of a fossil accretionary wedge, which preserve a metamorphic peak temperature gradient ranging from 200 to 330 \u00b0C (Fig. 1\n). A major advantage of the chosen study area is the preservation of temperature and deformation gradients, whereas the units show sedimentary differences on a regional scale. However, for this study we only select slate-rich intervals with similar mineral assemblages in order to minimise the effect of primary variations in the sedimentary evolution.\n\n\n2\nGeological background and samples\nThe European Alps were formed due to collision between the European and Adriatic plate. In the Mesozoic, both the European and Adriatic plate were dominated by carbonate sediments at their margins, which were deposited on prior rifted continental crust (e.g., Lemoine and Tr\u00fcmpy (1987)). The former southern European margin is now preserved in the Helvetic domain (Pfiffner et al., 2011). With the inversion from extension to compression tectonics, the depositional environment changed, leading to orogenic Flysch deposits in underfilled orogen-parallel ocean basins (Sinclair, 1997). These are typically mass flow processes manifested as turbidites and associated marine sediments.\nThe study area is located in central Switzerland between the village of Weesen in the north and the locality Flims in the south (Fig. 1). The preserved sediments represent the final stages of Flysch sedimentation when the Ultra-, South-, and North-Helvetic realm (Fig. 2\n) became progressively incorporated into the accretionary prism of the emerging Alps. This ended in continent-continent collision with a change from Flysch to Molasse deposition (Sinclair, 1997). For this study, eight samples (about 300-500 g each) were taken from slate-rich lithologies from these Flysch units along an increasing metamorphic gradient (Fig. 1 and Table A.1). Data from calcite-dolomite thermometry (Ebert et al., 2007), Raman spectroscopy on carbonaceous material (Lahfid et al., 2010) and fluid inclusion data (Rahn et al., 1995) indicate that peak metamorphic temperatures increase throughout the different Flysch units from north to south from 200 \u00b0C to 330 \u00b0C.\nThe Ultrahelvetic Sardona unit comprises a continuous series of Cenomaninan-Campanian (97-74 Ma) Globotruncana limestone and marl as well as Maastrichtian-Bartonian Flysch deposits (Lihou and Allen (1996); Fig. 2). The Globotruncana limestone and marl are interpreted as hemipelagic sediments deposited in a starved deep marine environment (Lihou and Allen, 1996) while still being part of the European passive margin. In the Maastrichtian (74-65 Ma), foreland basin sedimentation commenced with the deposition of siliciclastic Flysch. The resulting Infraquartzite Flysch unit, mostly consisting of calcareous turbidites, shows that sediment input from the orogenic wedge was restricted and input mostly originated from a southerly sediment source, which could be the North Pr\u00e4ttigau Swell, identified as a structural high (R\u00fcefli, 1959). In the Paleocene to early Eocene (65-50 Ma), there was a transition from calcareous to siliceous turbidite sedimentation related to a relative sea level fall, which led to erosion of the shelf. These deposits are represented by the Sardona quartzite formation (Lihou and Allen, 1996) and did not only have sediment input from the southerly located North Pr\u00e4ttigau Swell but also from the uplifted northerly located South Helvetic Swell (R\u00fcefli, 1959). In the middle Eocene (50-40 Ma), the entire shelf was flooded due to a transgression. In the Sardona basin, the youngest Flysch unit, the Supraquartzitic Flysch, was deposited and records the transition back to calcareous turbidite sedimentation (Lihou and Allen, 1996). Along with the final stages of accretion, the tectonic Austroalpine and Penninic nappes were piled upon the Flysch units when the accretionary wedge formed the tectonically active plate boundary. With the subsequent onset of continent-continent collision, a large-scale out-of-sequence thrust, the Glarus thrust, decapitated the entire prism geometry by bringing Helvetic nappes on the formerly imbricated Flysch units (e.g. Schmid (1975)), leading to peak metamorphic overprint of the Flysch units (Ebert et al., 2007; Herwegh et al., 2008; Lahfid et al., 2010).\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nMicrostructural imaging\nThin sections were cut from rocks and studied with a petrographic microscope (Zeiss Axioplan) to confirm mineralogy and microstructure and to select areas of interest for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron microprobe analysis (EPMA; see below). We used a Zeiss EVO 50 SEM with backscatter and secondary-electron detectors at the Institute of Geological Sciences, University of Bern, to obtain high-resolution microstructure images of the selected areas of interest.\n\n\n3.2\nGrain size separation and estimation of mass fractions\nFor grain size separation of the slate rocks, a combination of high-voltage disintegration Selfrag\u2122 and a gravity-settling technique, based on Stokes law (Fig. 3\n, stage 1 to 3), was used at the Institute of Geological Sciences, University of Bern. The high-voltage disintegration method has been proven to be a reliable disintegration technique in claystones for the use of isotope geochronology (Zwingmann et al., 2017). Starting volumes for Selfrag\u2122 were about 314-543 grams of whole rock. The rocks were disintegrated with 15 pulses with a 25 mm electrode gap, followed by 200 to 400 pulses with a 20 mm electrode gap. Operating conditions of the Selfrag\u2122 were 3 Hz and 150 kV. This method uses significant amounts of water, which was collected and eventually reduced using a centrifuge to minimise the loss of any sample material. From all collected disintegrated sample material, a whole-rock sample was separated. All material was subsequently sieved (wet with a one-way sieve) to 64 \u03bcm, after which water was again reduced using a centrifuge, and all sample material was dried at 38 \u00b0C.\nThe gravity settling was performed in Atterberg cylinders (20 cm high). The cylinders were each filled with 15-20 grams of sample material (<64 \u03bcm) and ionised for about 4 minutes to prevent the formation of grain aggregates before a NH4OH 0.01N solution was added. Settling times were calculated using SediCalc software (from Stefan Krumm, software published in 2006). The following grain size fractions were separated from the whole rock: <0.8 \u03bcm, 0.8-2 \u03bcm, 2-4 \u03bcm, 4-32 \u03bcm, 32-64 \u03bcm. In the case of the sample with the highest metamorphic grade, only 1 g sample material was obtained for the grain size fraction <0.8 \u03bcm, possibly due to thermal grain growth processes during metamorphism (see below). Owing to the sample nature, it was not feasible to separate sufficient fine fraction material of <0.1 \u03bcm. The accurate weight of the dry whole rock at the start was compared with the sum of the obtained grain size fractions after the grain size separation process (Fig. 3, stage 4 and Supplementary Material). These weights are needed in a next step for \u2018mass proportion calculations\u2019.\n\n\n3.3\nMineral chemistry\n\n3.3.1\nX-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD)\nAll X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out and analysed at the Institute of Geological Sciences, University of Bern. Measurements were performed on non-oriented samples of the separated grain size fractions. Corundum was used as internal standard, in order to perform a quantitative analysis. Corundum was milled in fractions of 5 g Al2O3 and 10 ml ethanol for 10 minutes on half speed in a \u201cMcCrone mill\u201d (Retsch), before mixing with the sample.\nThe measurements of the non-oriented samples were performed with a PANalytical CubiX3 diffractometer, equipped with a Cu source and a secondary beam graphite monochromator. The data were collected from 5 to 75\u00b0 2\u0398 with a step size of 0.02\u00b0 2\u0398, 1.5 s integration time per step and a fixed divergence slit of 1\/4\u00b0. All quantitative phase analyses were performed with Topas-Academic (Coelho Software). The diffraction patterns were first refined using the Rietveld method, yielding quantitative information about all included phases. An overview of used phase structures for refinements can be found in Appendix B. However, due to unknown structural and chemical features, Rietveld quantification of clay minerals is problematic and may bias results of all other phases (e.g. Kemp et al. (2019)). Therefore, combined Rietveld\/Pawley approaches were applied (Pawley, 1981). In this case, clay minerals are not directly accounted for in the quantification process. For the pure Rietveld refinements, admixed corundum was used to determine the amount of amorphous or undetermined material. Combined Rietveld\/Pawley refinements yield the amount of amorphous\/undetermined phases, including all clay minerals. The comparison of pure Rietveld and combined Rietveld\/Pawley refinements allows us to observe accurate trends of all non-clay minerals, whereas the pure Rietveld refinements may give insight about changes in the clay mineral fractions. We used the Pawley approach as a quality control on the Rietveld data. We found the total amount of amorphous or undetermined minerals plus clay minerals from both refinements yield acceptable differences (Supplementary Material), and therefore only the Rietveld data are discussed in the results below.\nTo detect the presence of mixed-layers illite\/smectite, we made additional diffractometer diagrams of oriented samples from the grain size fractions (Appendix Fig. B.1). The oriented samples on glass plates were measured: 1) in air and, 2) directly after being in an ethylene glycol atmosphere at 50 \u00b0C for 24 hours. The latter treatment induces swelling of clay minerals, which would be visualized in the obtained patterns. Measurements were performed with a Philips Analytical PW3710 diffractometer, equipped with a Cu anode from 2 to 40\u00b0 2\u0398 and a step size of 0.02\u00b0 2\u0398, with 1 s integration time per step and a fixed divergence slit of 1\u00b0.\nThe absolute phase amount per grain size fraction, or the mass proportion, was obtained from the mass data of the fraction weight (Fig. 3, step 4) and the evaluated quantity of each mineral in each fraction (Fig. 4a). We calculate the mass proportion of the grain size fractions, from the weights measured beforehand, to the whole rock weight. Secondly, we calculate how much of the measured volume phase from the XRD is present in each of these proportional grain size fractions, for each sample (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Material).\n\n\n3.3.2\nElectron microprobe analysis (EPMA)\nA JEOL 8200 superprobe instrument was used at the Institute of Geological Sciences, University of Bern. We performed spot analysis to obtain chemical quantification of white mica. For standardization we used anorthite (Ca, Al), orthoclase (Si, K), albite (Na), olivine (Mg, Fe), ilmenite (Ti), Tephroite (Mn). We applied a 3 \u03bcm spot size, an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a current of 10 nA. Due to the spot size limitation, grains smaller than 3 \u03bcm were not analysed. For white mica, oxides were recalculated to cations by the use of 12 oxygens and 2 hydrogens.\n\n\n\n3.4\nK-Ar dating\nConventional K-Ar dating was used instead of 40Ar-39Ar dating, since the latter, especially regarding fine-grained clay minerals, is affected by 39Ar recoil during sample irradiation and requires non-standardized corrections (Clauer et al., 2012). K-Ar dating was carried out at the CSIRO Energy facilities in Perth, Australia, on the following grain size fractions: <0.8 \u03bcm, 0.8-2 \u03bcm, 2-4 \u03bcm, 4-32 \u03bcm and whole rock splits. K content was determined by ICP-OES (Agilent), and ~ 20 mg dry sample aliquots were dissolved with HF and HNO3 (Heinrichs and Herrmann, 2013). The samples, once in solution, were diluted to ~ 20 ppm K for the ICP-OES analysis. The error of K determinations of all samples and K standard (MA-N) is below 2% (2 \u03c3). Ar isotopic determinations were performed using a procedure similar to that described (Bonhomme, 1975). For Ar analysis by noble gas spectrometry, ~20 mg sample splits were loaded into clean Mo foil (Goodfellow molybdenum foil, thickness 0.0125 mm, purity 99.9%), weighed and subsequently heated to 80 \u00b0C overnight to remove moisture, and reweighted using a Mettler AT20 balance. The measured dry weight was used in the K-Ar age calculation. Samples were stored in a desiccator prior to loading into the Ar-extraction vacuum line. Once loaded, the samples were heated under vacuum at 80 \u00b0C for several hours to reduce the amount of atmospheric Ar adsorbed onto the mineral surfaces during sample handling. Ar was extracted from the test portions by fusing them in a furnace attached to the vacuum line, containing an on-line 38Ar spike pipette. The isotopic composition of the spiked Ar was measured with an on-line VG3600 mass spectrometer using a high Faraday cup. During the course of the study, three international reference materials (2 HD-B1 and 1 LP-6) and two airshots (small amounts of air for 40Ar-36Ar ratio measurement) were analysed. The results are summarized in Table 1\n. The error for Ar analyses was below 1.00% and the average 40Ar-36Ar value of the airshots yielded 296.03 \u00b1 0.20. The general error for Ar analyses is below 1% (2 \u03c3) based on the long-term precision of Ar measurements of the international reference materials. The K-Ar ages were calculated using 40K abundance and decay constants recommended by Steiger and J\u00e4ger (1977). The age uncertainties account for the errors during sample weighing, 38Ar-36Ar and 40Ar-38Ar measurements and K analysis.\n\n\n3.5\nSynchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (SXFM)\nThe XFM beamline at the Australian Synchrotron (Howard et al., 2020) was used to image thin sections of 30 \u03bcm thickness mounted on quartz slides and data were analysed as discussed in Akker (2020). Samples were scanned at 2 mm s\u22121 horizontally through an 18.5 keV X-ray beam focused to ~2 \u03bcm diameter by a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror pair. A sampling interval in both the horizontal and vertical direction of 2 \u03bcm combined with the spot size yield a spatial resolution of ~2 \u03bcm with an effective per-pixel dwell of 1 ms. A Maia (Rev D) detector system positioned in its typical backscatter geometry was used to collect the excited fluorescence photons. All spectra were subsequently analysed using the Dynamic Analysis (Ryan and Jamieson, 1993) method as part of GeoPIXE (Ryan et al., 2005) and quantified using standard metallic foils, producing quantitative images of elements from sulphur to strontium. Due to the beamline and detection parameters, elements lighter than sulphur cannot be accurately quantified.\n\n\n\n4\nResults and interpretations\n\n4.1\nMineralogy and mass proportion calculations\nThe whole-rock mineralogy of the slates consists of detrital clasts of calcite, quartz, dolomite and albite as well as primary chlorite and white mica. Accessory minerals are rutile and pyrite. White mica is the only K-bearing phase in this assemblage. There are no major differences in the mineral assemblage between the different samples, and in all samples, white mica occurs as dioctahedral potassic white mica of the 2M polytype, as confirmed by the absence of the 2.58 \u00c5 peak in the obtained diffractometer diagrams, which is consistent with the data of Hunziker et al. (1986). However, the sample with the lowest peak metamorphic temperature (sample A, 200 \u00b0C) shows the presence of minor swellable layers (Appendix Fig. B.1), which are most likely illite\/smectite mixed layer minerals. The XRD spectra show that most of these mixed layer clays occur in the smallest grain size fraction (<0.8 \u03bcm) (Appendix Figure B.1). In all other samples, with peak metamorphic temperatures above 230 \u00b0C, such mixed-layers are absent, and this mineral group is dominated by a 2M polytype white mica (Appendix Figure B.2).\nThe whole-rock mineralogy of the slates consists of detrital clasts of calcite, quartz, dolomite and albite as well as primary chlorite and white mica.

Sample E (300 \u00b0C) shows the smallest amount of phyllosilicates in almost each grain size fraction compared to all other samples (Fig. 4a). The amount of quartz and calcite versus phyllosilicates (white mica plus chlorite) increases with increasing grain size (orange shades against green shades in Fig. 4a). The largest amount of phyllosilicates, relative to quartz and calcite, is present in the smallest grain size fractions. Combining the results of the mass proportion calculations with the XRD data allows to obtain the absolute phase mass within each grain size fraction (Fig. 4b). This indicates that the grain size fraction <0.8 \u03bcm almost entirely consists of white mica. Chlorite was identified only in coarser grain size fractions >0.8 \u03bcm.\n\n\n4.2\nMicrostructure \u2013 general cleavage formation\nIn the field, bedding and main cleavage orientation are mostly subparallel to each other. In some cases a macroscopic second oblique cleavage exists. In thin section (e.g. sample F and H in Fig. 5\n), the alignment and interconnectivity of phyllosilicates together with the elongation of calcite and quartz grains along the metamorphic and strain gradient forms an increasingly anisotropic planar fabric. In the SXFM element maps, chlorite is indicated by elevated Fe concentrations, and white mica is identified by elevated Rb concentrations (Fig. 5). The low-temperature and low-strain sample (Fig. 5a) shows chlorite, white mica and fossils (mainly Globigerina) in a fine-grained matrix. The alignment of phyllosilicates forms a weak fabric. With increasing temperature, pressure and background deformation, the fabric becomes stronger, and at 320 \u00b0C and intermediate-strain a wavy cleavage exists (Fig. 5b). The high-temperature and high-strain end member at 330 \u00b0C shows a regular and narrowly spaced cleavage (Fig. 5c). Here, the cleavage comprises mostly white mica. Chlorite mainly precipitates in the pressure shadows of the fossils (Fig. 5c and Fig. 6b,c). The latter is indicative for pressure-dissolution and precipitation, which is the dominant ductile deformation mechanism in these rocks (Akker, 2020). Note that individual segments of Globigerina chambers show clear evidence for partial dissolution while retaining their initial round shape even up to the highest strain and temperature (Fig. 5). Therefore, any shape change of these strong clasts is accommodated by pressure dissolution (Fig. 5c).\n\n\n4.3\nPhyllosilicate morphology and chemistry\nComparing two carbonate-rich slates with increasing temperatures (Fig. 6a-b, i.e. 200 \u00b0C and 320 \u00b0C) indicates that (i) phyllosilicates increase in grain size due to grain growth and (ii) both white mica and chlorite start to interconnect, evolving into phyllosilicate-rich cleavage planes (Fig. 6b). In this way the main layer-parallel cleavage becomes interconnected by an oblique one. These phyllosilicate-rich cleavage planes separate quartz and calcite grains. The initial absence of the oblique cleavage planes (Fig. 6a) suggests recrystallization of newly formed grains with increasing metamorphic grade. Shearing-induced passive rotation of existing grains could have already resulted in the formation of the main layer-parallel cleavage domain. However, the SEM data provide evidence for neocrystallization by precipitation of phyllosilicates in pore space and grain boundaries (Fig. 6d,e,f).\nWith increasing metamorphic grade and strain, the quartz and calcite grains become elongated, indicating that the grain edges dissolve. The dissolution of detrital quartz and calcite accommodates flattening perpendicular to the main compression direction. Simultaneous stretching parallel to the extension directions provides space for precipitation. Precipitation comprises the cleavage-parallel oriented growth of quartz and calcite with elongated shape and precipitation of phyllosilicates on the cleavage planes in the same orientation as the elongated grains (compare Fig. 6a-b). On the grain scale, three types of phyllosilicate grains have been identified (Fig. 7c, grains i-iii): i) mixed aggregates of white mica and chlorite, often deformed, bent or with an oblique angle to the main cleavage, ii) large elongated grains (~ 50 \u03bcm long) of white mica or chlorite, aligned parallel to the S0 or S1 and, iii) small grains (~ 10 \u03bcm long) of white mica or chlorite, either parallel or oblique to the S0 or S1, or overgrowing other phases such as quartz and calcite.\nIn the low-temperature sample (230 \u00b0C; Fig. 7a), the white mica composition shows an exchange between Na and K (Fig. 7d, paragonite exchange; Parra et al. (2002)). Towards higher temperatures (330 \u00b0C), this trend changes to white mica compositions showing an alkali deficiency, which is caused by the pyrophyllite substitution ((Na, K)xiiAliv = \u25a1xiiSiiv), where \u25a1 = vacancy (Fig. 7d-e) (Parra et al., 2002). The large white mica grain in sample H (Fig. 7c, spot 1 and 2) still shows the detrital composition, whereas the small grains (Fig. 7, spot 4) already show the new recrystallized composition including a pyrophyllite substitution component. However, not all grains follow this trend, for example the relatively small grain in Fig. 7c (spot 3), which still shows the detrital composition, or a composition in between the two end members.\n\n\n4.4\nK-Ar data of white mica\nThe apparent K-Ar age data as well as reference materials and airshot data are given in Table 1. As white mica is the only K-bearing phase in these rocks, the results can be used as proxy for chemical processes in white mica. Illite\/smectite mixed-layer minerals, such as those seen in sample A (Appendix Fig. B.1), as well as mixed aggregates of white mica and chlorite cannot be physically separated and are therefore present within the measured fractions. Two trends are observed in the K-Ar data (Fig. 8a): (i) all apparent ages increase with increasing grain size and (ii) apparent ages decrease with increasing metamorphic grade. This implies that the amount of white mica recrystallization increases with increasing metamorphic grade. In order to quantify the amount of white mica recrystallization along the metamorphic gradient, we use a diagram of grain size versus isotopic ratio (Fig. 8b). Besides plotting the measured isotopic ratios for sample C, this diagram also displays two potential end members. The first one is the end member approximating the purely detrital composition, representing the starting material which is derived from coarse-grained granites from the hinterland (Lihou and Allen, 1996; Sinclair, 1997). This yields the respective rad. 40Ar-40K ratio in the primary detrital grains calculated from the age of 280 Ma (see the age equation in Appendix C and Table C.1). For detrital mica from these granites, we infer a typical coarse grain size of about 500 \u03bcm. The lower fine-grained end member represents a completely recrystallized sample and is calculated with the minimum assumption of about 20 Ma (Hunziker et al., 1986; Nibourel, 2019; Nibourel et al., 2018). For this sample, we infer a fine grain size of about 0.1 \u03bcm, which is the limit of the theoretical expected smallest grain size and commonly used in literature (e.g. (Torgersen et al., 2015b); Zwingmann et al., 2004). By plotting these two end members in the diagram of Fig. 8b and calculating a linear regression it is possible to estimate the amount of recrystallization for any specific grain size in between the two end members. This approach is only feasible by neglecting rad. 40Ar loss by diffusion (see overview in Section 5.3). These estimates of recrystallization of each grain size are combined with the amount of micas in each grain size fraction obtained by quantitative XRD. In this way, the ratio between detrital and newly formed micas (recrystallized proportion) in each grain size fraction is estimated (Fig. 8c). The results indicate that (i) the absolute portion of detrital grains increases with increasing grain size and (ii) with increasing metamorphic grade, the amount of recrystallization increases (Fig. 8d).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nIn the following sections, we discuss the relationship between Ar data, mineral chemistry and microstructure and present an interpretation of the K-Ar data in the context of the geological setting and aim to gain better insight in the quantification of the resetting processes.\n\n5.1\nThe relation between Ar data, mineral chemistry and microstructure\nExcluding Ar diffusion as resetting process, most analysed grain size fractions of white mica reflect a mixture of non- or partially reset grains (detrital grains) with newly formed grains (recrystallized). With increasing metamorphic gradient, the amount of recrystallized white mica increases (Fig. 8). Along this trend the mineral chemistry of white mica changes from a composition dominated by the paragonite component to a composition dominated by the pyrophyllite component.\nAssuming that the proportion of detrital grains decreases with increasing metamorphic grade, we link the detrital chemistry to the paragonite component. However, not all large grains, which are often assumed to be detrital, preserve the detrital chemistry; some show a chemistry closer to the recrystallized chemistry, indicating partial resetting of detrital grains. Similarly, not all small grains are recrystallized. Some small grains preserve the detrital composition and thus must have survived to higher metamorphic temperatures. This indicates that newly formed grains form in a large range of grain size fractions in the investigated samples, which could be the effect of grain coarsening with increasing metamorphic grade or of the different processes of the formation of new grains (Berger et al., 2017). However, the isotopic variation, showing decreasing apparent ages with increasing metamorphic grade (Fig. 8a), is directly connected to the microstructure. As the result of pressure solution, new fine grains precipitate on cleavage planes and in pressure shadows, the proportion of both increases along the metamorphic gradient (Figs. 5 and 6). The phyllosilicate-rich cleavage layers involve small grains, with grain sizes up to 10 \u03bcm. The development of such layers requires new recrystallization and reorganization of the rocks structure. Therefore, measuring radiogenic 40Ar in one grain size fraction from this evolving microstructure, which is a function of deformation mechanism and finite strain (Airaghi et al., 2018; Cossette et al., 2015; Mulch et al., 2005), yields different amounts of radiogenic 40Ar along the metamorphic and strain gradient. The complete understanding of the development of cleavage formation is missing, but new grains precipitate by dissolution-precipitation processes and affect the measured radiogenic 40Ar resulting in increasingly younger apparent ages with increasing metamorphic grade.\n\n\n5.2\nThe meaning of the K-Ar data in a regional context\nThe highest amount of isotopic resetting is expected in the smallest grain size at the highest investigated metamorphic grade with highest deformation, as represented by sample H, 0.8-2 \u03bcm. This sample yields an apparent K-Ar age of 27.1\u00b10.6 Ma (Table 1), indicating major deformation of the Flysch at ~27 Ma (Fig. 9a). The Flysch units are deformed continuously in the accretionary wedge before onset of the main out-of-sequence Glarus thrust (Dielforder et al., 2016). The main microstructures described in this study are related close to Tmax conditions. The main Helvetic thrusting, including the Glarus thrust, has to be younger than the youngest sediments on top of the Aar Massif at 34-32 Ma (Fig. 9b) (Fischer and Villa, 1990; Lu et al., 2019). The Glarus thrust and the investigated underlying Flysch units experienced coeval deformation due to the exhumation of the underlying basement (Aar Massif; Herwegh et al. (2008)). The timing of Tmax in the basement of the central Aar Massif is 22-20 Ma (Nibourel et al., 2018; Rolland et al., 2009), which is close to a zircon fission track age of about 19 Ma in the V\u00e4ttis window (Michalski and Soom, 1990). The V\u00e4ttis window is in near vicinity to the non-exhumed basement of the Glarus area. Therefore, from a regional point of view, the deformation of the Flysch units and the Glarus thrust had to be active between 32 Ma (youngest sediment) and ~20 Ma (Tmax of the exhumed basement). The mineral fractions of sample F (<0.8 \u03bcm) and sample H (0.8-2 and 2-4 \u03bcm) in this study fall in this time interval. Moreover, the data of sample H flatten out in a grain size versus apparent age diagram (Fig. 8a). The only direct isotope data out of the Glarus thrust indicates ages between 25-20 Ma (Hunziker et al., 1986), which is close to our obtained 27 Ma age considering the tectonic evolution summarized in Fig. 9.\n\n\n5.3\nIsotopic resetting: Ar diffusion and recrystallization\nThe meaning of white mica ages with regard to Ar diffusion is widely discussed in the literature (e.g. Allaz et al. (2011); Dodson (1973); Harrison et al. (2009); Kirschner et al. (1996); Villa (2016); Villa and Hanchar (2017)). However, recrystallization and a series of replacement structures are also known to affect the mineral chemistry and isotope data (e.g. Airaghi et al. (2017); Berger et al. (2017); Villa and Hanchar (2017)). In the sections above, microstructural and chemical evidence demonstrate the presence of recrystallization of white micas at all temperature conditions and for all grain sizes. Moreover, an increasing degree of recrystallization is observed with increasing temperature (Fig. 8). Hence, the question arises: what is the influence of recrystallization versus diffusion on the final Ar budget? Three hypotheses can be postulated. The measured variations in rad. 40Ar\/40K ratios might be (a) purely volume diffusion-controlled, (b) purely recrystallization-controlled or (c) controlled by a combination of both, potentially with variable contribution of each process with increasing temperature. The hypothesis (c) implies potential loss or Ar from detrital grains as well as from newly formed grains by volume diffusion at or near Tmax. To test these hypotheses, we estimate the effect of diffusion with simple diffusion models at the temperatures and grain sizes of interest. For this purpose, we use the analytical solution of Watson et al. (2010) for an infinite slab to model Ar diffusion (Appendix D). This choice corresponds to the assumption that micas are thin platelets, which lose their Ar by outgassing along the shortest spatial axis (perpendicular to cleavage) (Figure D.1). Watson et al. (2010) show that the infinite-slab model produces appropriate results for this geometry if the ratio of diffusivities along the crystallographic axes is < 10. The model calculates retained Ar fraction (G) for 0.1 Ma increments in the temperature-time space. The main controlling parameters are the evolution of both temperature and the related diffusion coefficient with time and the grain size (Fig. 10\n; Appendix D). The change in temperature with time is defined by the geological history of the investigated samples (see above and Fig. 9; Ebert et al. (2007); Hunziker et al. (1986); Lahfid et al. (2010); Nibourel et al. (2018); Pfiffner (1993); Rahn et al. (1995)). The prograde path starts with the termination of sedimentation of the Tavayannaz sandstone at 32 Ma (the youngest sediment of the investigated Flysch sequence) and the initial temperature is defined at 20\u00b0C (Fig. 10). The prograde path ends at peak metamorphic conditions (Tmax) at ~27 Ma. Peak metamorphic temperature in the studied Flysch units was reached by the overthrusting of the Upper Helvetic nappe stack, namely during activity of the Glarus thrust (Ebert et al., 2007; Herwegh et al., 2008; Lahfid et al., 2010). Peak metamorphism lasted until 20 Ma, the latter correlating to the timing of the onset of vertical exhumation of the basement (see above). For the peak metamorphic temperature, we use three scenarios (200\u00b0C, 250\u00b0C, and 330\u00b0C, see Fig. 10) representing T-t paths at three locations along the general N-S temperature gradient. On the retrograde path, the temperature decreases to 20\u00b0C at 0 Ma (Fig. 10). The diffusion calculations were carried out for different characteristic diffusion lengths, assuming that grain sizes are a direct measure for the diffusion length. Only limited diffusion coefficients have been experimentally determined for white mica phyllosilicates (Wijbrans and McDougall (1986) and Harrison et al. (2009)). We applied both diffusion coefficients in our modelling (Figure D.2 and Table D.1). The solution of Watson et al. (2010) results in a fraction loss (F = 1-G) of the diffusing species depending on the following factors: temperature, time, diffusion length (grain size), diffusion coefficient and the activation energy (Appendix D). An extract of these results is summarized in Table 2\n.\nThe meaning of white mica ages with regard to Ar diffusion is widely discussed in the literature (e.g. Allaz et al. (2011); Dodson (1973); Harrison et al. (2009); Kirschner et al. (1996); Villa (2016); Villa and Hanchar (2017)). However, recrystallization and a series of replacement structures are also known to affect the mineral chemistry and isotope data (e.g. Airaghi et al. (2017); Berger et al.

Hence, the question arises: what is the influence of recrystallization versus diffusion on the final Ar budget? Three hypotheses can be postulated. The measured variations in rad. 40Ar\/40K ratios might be (a) purely volume diffusion-controlled, (b) purely recrystallization-controlled or (c) controlled by a combination of both, potentially with variable contribution of each process with increasing temperature. The hypothesis (c) implies potential loss or Ar from detrital grains as well as from newly formed grains by volume diffusion at or near Tmax. To test these hypotheses, we estimate the effect of diffusion with simple diffusion models at the temperatures and grain sizes of interest. For this purpose, we use the analytical solution of Watson et al. (2010) for an infinite slab to model Ar diffusion (Appendix D). This choice corresponds to the assumption that micas are thin platelets, which lose their Ar by outgassing along the shortest spatial axis (perpendicular to cleavage) (Figure D.1). Watson et al.

On the retrograde path, the temperature decreases to 20\u00b0C at 0 Ma (Fig. 10). The diffusion calculations were carried out for different characteristic diffusion lengths, assuming that grain sizes are a direct measure for the diffusion length. Only limited diffusion coefficients have been experimentally determined for white mica phyllosilicates (Wijbrans and McDougall (1986) and Harrison et al. (2009)). We applied both diffusion coefficients in our modelling (Figure D.2 and Table D.1). The solution of Watson et al. (2010) results in a fraction loss (F = 1-G) of the diffusing species depending on the following factors: temperature, time, diffusion length (grain size), diffusion coefficient and the activation energy (Appendix D). An extract of these results is summarized in Table 2\n.\nAt low temperatures (200\u00b0C), values for Ar loss by diffusion calculated for the Wijbrans and McDougall (1986) diffusion coefficient are at peak metamorphic conditions in the range of <1 to 16%, with the exception of the very small fraction, which results in a fraction loss of 76%. For the Harrison et al. (2009) diffusion coefficient, fraction loss is in the range of <1 to 6% and can be neglected in terms of rejuvenation of ages for all grain size fractions. With these values and given that the detrital input is Permian in age, we would expect to obtain Permian\/Triassic K-Ar ages and a grain-size-age relation for samples that underwent a low Tmax path (~200 \u00b0C). However, the resulting apparent ages of our samples are Upper Cretaceous (Table 1). This clearly demonstrates that the measured Ar values in such samples are controlled by other processes than Ar volume diffusion, which could be recrystallization.\nAt temperatures of about 250\u00b0, the used diffusion coefficients would indicate potential Ar loss for the grain size fraction of 0.2 and 2 \u03bcm at peak metamorphic temperatures. For grain sizes > 10 \u03bcm Ar loss is still minor, which means a loss less than <15% (Wijbrans and McDougall, 1986) and <5% (Harrison et al., 2009) of Ar in the detrital grains along the prograde path and at peak metamorphic conditions. However, the small grains show significant loss (up to 100%) of Ar at peak metamorphism conditions for both diffusion coefficients (relevant for age determination of new grains, see for example calculations of Huon et al. (1994); Kirschner et al. (1996)). For large grain sizes (>10 \u03bcm), diffusion alone cannot explain the measured isotopic ratios, which still yield Cretaceous ages. However, small grain sizes, which are more affected by Ar loss due to thermal diffusion, are still not entirely reset by recrystallization, as is seen by their apparent age. It is therefore likely that a combination of volume diffusion and recrystallization processes play a role at intermediate temperatures (~250\u00b0C).\nAt high temperatures (~330\u00b0C), the large grains still retain a substantial amount of Ar at the beginning of peak metamorphic temperatures, yielding ages which show an inherited Ar component from detrital grains. Smaller grains (<10 \u03bcm) lose about all their Ar and show the expected age of the main deformation phase in this area. This indicates that the system is chemically reset, which either could be entirely due to volume diffusion itself, or by completed recrystallization (Fig. 8).\nOur microstructural and mineral-chemical data (Figs. 5, 6, 7) demonstrate the occurrence of recrystallization as the result of dissolution-precipitation processes, which increases along the metamorphic and background strain gradient. The associated phyllosilicate cleavage planes show a grain-size reduction of detrital grains and grain growth of recrystallized grains along the studied gradient (Fig. 11\n). Numerous studies in literature have reported that recrystallization or replacement structures can change chemistry and rad. 40Ar-content of the micas (e.g. Airaghi et al. (2017); Berger et al. (2017)). Owing to aforementioned inconsistencies between models and measurements, such recrystallization processes outside pure volume diffusion are most likely in charge to rejuvenate the apparent mica ages at low temperatures (Fig. 11). We also show that recrystallization\/resetting is more pronounced and complete with increasing metamorphic temperatures. However, at high temperatures (~330\u00b0C) it remains difficult to resolve the contribution of the two end member processes, volume diffusion and recrystallization. Given the fact that recrystallization is becoming pervasive, classical volume diffusion is of minor relevance. However, it becomes a major Ar resetting process for completely recrystallized samples that sit for long times at peak metamorphic temperatures > 300\u00b0C. \n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThe changing isotope and mineral chemistry data of white mica in slates during increasing metamorphism is related to a microstructural development of spaced cleavage formed by the precipitation of phyllosilicates controlled by dissolution-precipitation creep. The data indicate that chemical resetting of the isotopic K-Ar system is controlled by this ductile deformation mechanism. Increasing strain requires larger amounts of mass transfer, which directly affects the isotopic resetting of the minerals. The relationship between isotopic resetting and grain size is not simple as seen by the chemical changes in white mica along the studied temperature gradient. However, most of the small grains (< 10 \u03bcm) include newly formed, recrystallized or chemically reset grains. These recrystallized grains precipitate out of solution and form the spaced cleavage of the slates, whereas the large grains, (partly) preserve the detrital composition. Therefore, apparent ages in such slates depend on the selected grain size as well as the amount and type of deformation, of which the intensity changes with metamorphic grade. The combination of quantification of a certain grain size fraction, mineral quantities and the K-Ar system represents therefore a valuable tool to estimate the amount of recrystallization in white mica in slates. Hence, this tool can be of great interest when estimating the amount of dehydration and fluid liberation in fossil accretionary wedges. Knowledge of time-integrated liberation of fluids is fundamental in understanding the mechanics of accretionary wedges, where the amount of available fluid controls fast seismic versus slow aseismic deformation. Only in the case of a nearly complete resetting, reliable age information of deformation can be gained by the presented approach, else quantitative information on the amount of recrystallization of the phyllosilicate spectrum can be obtained. With respect to a regional geological perspective, therefore only the smallest white mica fractions with the highest volume of reset material result in a geological meaningful age of 27.1\u00b10.6 Ma, which is in close agreement with the timing of the dominating deformation phase in this area of the European Alps.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nMH and AB designed the project.

Earthquake nucleation depends on several physical processes that are often difficult to model. Several phenomena, such as seismicity patterns, changes in b-value, aseismic deformation-rate changes, seismic velocity changes, modifications of hydrological and geochemical parameters, and changes in the electrical and magnetic field have been sometimes observed before strong earthquakes (Bouchon et al., 2013; Cicerone et al., 2009; Crampin et al., 2015; Hartmann and Levy, 2005; Mavrommatis et al., 2014; Ohtake et al., 1981; Roeloffs, 1988; Schurr et al., 2014). However, their relationship with the upcoming earthquake is controversial. Some phenomena may be related to the beginning of processes associated with the earthquake nucleation or may indicate a general advanced state of the loading cycle. Also, other phenomena are observed, but their occurrence in the vicinity of and sometimes before the occurrence of an earthquake is a mere coincidence (Scholz, 2019).\nUnderstanding the physical processes that can precede earthquakes is mandatory to correctly identify geophysically observable phenomena and eventually use them for forecasting purposes. This work aims at understanding the physical processes related to the nucleation of the Mw 6.3\u00a0L'Aquila earthquake (hereinafter L'Aquila 2009) that happened in Central Italy on 6 April 2009 (Fig. 1a). The earthquake occurred along the Central Apennines belt, which is characterized by extensional tectonics, with normal faulting mainly confined in the upper crust (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012; Galadini et al., 2012; Chiarabba et al., 2015), and nucleated approximately 4\u00a0km southwest of the city of L'Aquila, at a depth of approximately 9\u00a0km (Valoroso et al., 2013) (Fig. 1b). The earthquake dislocated the Paganica fault, a normal fault trending NW-SE and dipping 45 to 50 degrees to the SW (Atzori et al., 2009; Castaldo et al., 2018; Falcucci et al., 2009; Gori et al., 2012; Trasatti et al., 2011; Volpe et al., 2012). The mainshock was followed by a 3-year-long aftershock sequence comprising more than 80,000 events that occurred within a 35-km-long NW-SE-trending area (Fig. 1b) (Chiaraluce et al., 2011; Valoroso et al., 2013).\nSeveral a-posteriori studies identified some seismological, geophysical and geodetic signals in the days to months before the event. A cluster of small foreshocks occurred nearby the mainshock hypocentre in the previous six months. These events (blue dots in Fig. 1b) started on a narrow band of the deepest portion of the NW-SE trending and SW dipping main fault, then switched on an antithetic plane, NW-SE trending and NE dipping, where an Mw 4.0 foreshock occurred on 30 March 2009. In the last week before the mainshock, the seismicity switched again to the mainshock rupture plane (Chiaraluce et al., 2011). Fluctuations in the b-value were also reported in the months before the mainshock, reflecting increasing stress due to fracture growth on a local patch of the fault before the mainshock rupture (De Gori et al., 2012; Sugan et al., 2014; Gulia et al., 2016). Changes in the VP\/VS ratio and anisotropy parameters were also observed from January 2009 (Baccheschi et al., 2019; Di Luccio et al., 2013; Lucente et al., 2010). Additionally, GPS and InSAR data identified specific patterns of ground deformation in the vicinity of the epicentral area. An analysis of continuous GPS stations identified a transient signal, which was attributed to a slow slip event that originated beneath the reactivated normal faulting system (Borghi et al., 2016). Multitemporal analysis of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data (InSAR) identified a preseismic broad signal of unclear origin (Atzori et al., 2013). Another InSAR study identified subsidence acceleration, starting three years before the earthquake, in two Quaternary sedimentary basins (located north-west of the main fault), that experienced about 10\u201315\u00a0mm of subsidence (Moro et al., 2017).\nThe occurrence of most of these observations has been interpreted in the framework of the dilatancy-diffusion conceptual model (Nur, 1972; Scholz, 1974). This model assumes that dilatancy occurs within a stressed volume surrounding an impending rupture zone and evolves at an accelerating rate, potentially involving the development of pore pressure changes and the diffusion of highly pressurized fluids, like groundwater or CO2 overpressurized reservoirs (Chiodini et al., 2004), which triggered the mainshock. Although many works share this view, none of them provided a quantitative characterization of the interseismic crustal dynamics and the potential stress and strain field (Lucente et al., 2010; Moro et al., 2017; Savage, 2010; Sugan et al., 2014; Terakawa et al., 2010).\nIn this work, we focused on quantifying stress and strain variations at depth and discussing how they relate to the occurrence of the mainshock. To this purpose, we developed a first-order, crustal-scale 3D static numerical model to jointly simulate the long-term crustal interseismic loading and the coseismic brittle episodic dislocation associated with the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake. The model assumes a framework of gravitational and tectonic forces that is compatible with the geodynamics of the Central Apennines region of the Italian territory. Here, the fault dislocates under the effect of the internal stress and strain field, which are the result of the applied far-field boundary conditions, forces, and rheological behaviour of geomaterials. Differently from kinematic models, in which the fault slip is the forcing term and is determined to fit the coseismic data, the static forward model can help to quantify the stress and strain changes before earthquake nucleation.\nThe results of our physical model provide a quantitative picture of the interseismic stress and strain pattern at seismogenic depth before the earthquake nucleation. Modelling of the interseismic phase shows evidence of interseismic dilatancy at depth in the hanging wall, in a volume embedding the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake, while volumetric contraction develops in the footwall. In terms of stresses, interseismic Coulomb stress changes promote the coseismic dislocation of the fault responsible for the L'Aquila 2009 mainshock. Such stress and strain changes provide a quantitative description for the seismological, geophysical and geodetic phenomena observed before the mainshock.\n\n\n2\nMethods\n\n2.1\nConceptual scheme and numerical model\nThe stress, strain and displacement fields associated with the interseismic and coseismic phases of the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake were simulated by assuming a first-order conceptual scheme that presents a simple fault plane cross-cutting a medium composed of a brittle upper crust and a plastic lower crust (Fig. 2\n). We speculate that the fault has two different slip styles along the dip direction, i.e., an episodic stick-slip behaviour along its brittle upper part (representing an asperity), and steady-state shear (creep) behaviour along its deeper part (Scholz, 2019). In the interseismic phase (Fig. 2a), the presence of the gravitational force ensures that the stress tensor is compressive at every depth in the crust. However, the presence of extensional tectonic loads gradually reduces the horizontal stresses. The different behaviour of the locked upper part of the fault concerning the viscous shearing of its plastic lower part generates extensional stress and strain gradients in a crustal volume of the hanging wall at the brittle-plastic transition, antithetic to the main fault plane (Fig. 2a) (Doglioni et al., 2011, 2014, 2015). This model also applies for normal faults forming above a shallow dip basal decollement within the brittle upper crust, as in the Mw 6.5 Amatrice-Norcia 2016 seismic sequence (Bignami et al., 2019). A dilated volume may gradually develop during the interseismic period, creating a volume weakened by fracturing that, depending on the tectonic loading-rate, the relative permeability of the rock, and the presence of sealing barriers, could involve the development of pore fluid pressure gradients, fluid migration, as well as changes in physical properties of the rock (Lucente et al., 2010; Doglioni et al., 2014).\nThe interseismic stress and strain gradients promote the coseismic dislocation of the upper fault plane, thus dissipating the accumulated stress and strain by the rapid downward movement of the hanging wall and recovering the dilated volume at depth (Fig. 2b).\nWe exploited this conceptual scheme to simulate the interseismic and coseismic phases of the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake in the framework of the geodynamic setting of the Central Apennines (Fig. 1a), dominated by the W- and SW-ward subduction of the Adriatic plate and E- and NE-ward retreat of the subduction hinge, relative to the upper European plate. This geodynamic setting generates contraction and the generation of the accretionary prism in the frontal part of the belt (the western Adriatic Sea) and contemporaneous extension in the backarc area all along the Apennines belt and the Tyrrhenian Sea (Doglioni, 1991). From the Late Eocene-Oligocene to present time, the Apennines fold-and-thrust belt was characterized by the eastward (in the Central and Southern Apennines) migration of thrust fronts (Malinverno and Ryan, 1986; Patacca et al., 1990). To the east, the Adriatic margin served as the foreland to the migrating thrust belt. Starting in the Late Miocene, extensional tectonics, associated with backarc rifting, dissected the Apennines by high-angle normal and oblique faulting, which cut through the pre-existing compressional structures (Ferranti and Oldow, 1999; Hippolyte et al., 1994) and progressively migrated from the western to the eastern parts of the orogen (Malinverno and Ryan, 1986; Patacca et al., 1990; Westaway, 1990; Doglioni, 1991; Amato and Montone, 1997). Nowadays, the accretionary prism is still active, and thrusting is currently active on the Adriatic side of the Central Apennines, as indicated by seismicity, deformation of Quaternary sediments, and GPS data (Fig. 1a) (Cuffaro et al., 2010; Palano, 2015; Livani et al., 2018). Thrusting is also active along the Dinarides belts, where the Adriatic plate subducts ENE-ward beneath Eurasia (Fig. 1a) (Kastelic and Carafa, 2012).\nThis geodynamic context has been simulated with a 3D finite element numerical model, built with the commercial code MSC Marc 2018 (MSC Software Corporation, 2018), which encompasses a broad area, including most of the Central Italy Apennine chain and the Adriatic Sea offshore (dashed black rectangle in Fig. 1a). One of the most challenging tasks in tectonic modelling is the definition of appropriate model dimensions and boundary conditions. The simulation of the L'Aquila earthquake is performed adopting the setting used in previous numerical models of the interseismic deformation in central Italy (Barba et al., 2010, 2008; Candela et al., 2015; Finocchio et al., 2016, 2013). Such models were expanded to include the coseismic dislocation scheme proposed by Doglioni et al. (2011). The model (Fig. 3\n) extends 220\u00a0km in the NE-SW (x-direction in Fig. 3) and 120\u00a0km in the NW-SE (z-direction in Fig. 3), for a depth of 40\u00a0km. The model bottom is fixed along the vertical direction, while the upper boundary is free to move (Fig. 3). The lateral boundaries present roller constraints that lock the horizontal movements orthogonally to the model sides. Such a choice agrees with the interseismic horizontal velocity vectors from GPS (Fig. 1c) (Devoti et al., 2017), which show that the horizontal interseismic ground motion is approximately SW-NE of the model (the x-direction in Fig. 3) and is negligible along the NW-SE direction (the z-direction in Fig. 3). Moreover, an approximately zero-velocity area corresponds to the SW model boundary (Fig. 1c), which agrees with the assumed horizontal fixity. The NE boundary of the model is constrained by considering that the Adriatic domain is undergoing compression (Fig. 1a) and that the horizontal strain-rate and velocity in the middle of the Adriatic sea offshore is almost negligible (Carafa et al., 2015; Pezzo et al., 2020). Thus, the location of the NE model boundary is set at approximately 80\u201390\u00a0km offshore, roughly equidistant from the Apennines and Dinarides thrust fronts.\nThe applied forces consist of the gravitational force (green arrows in Fig. 3) and uniform shear tractions at the model base (blue arrows in Fig. 3), directed towards the NE and parallel to the x-direction of the model. The latter simulates the basal shear traction exerted by the eastward mantle flow associated with the rollback of the Adriatic slab and has been successfully adopted to simulate the active tectonic deformation in the Central Mediterranean (Barba et al., 2008, 2010; Candela et al., 2015; Finocchio et al., 2013, 2016). Basal shear tractions, together with the horizontal constraints at the SW and NE model sides, enable a first-order description of the ongoing crustal interseismic stretching of the Central Apennine chain and the compression of the Adriatic offshore (Fig. 1a) (Doglioni, 1991; Doglioni et al., 1999; Carafa and Bird, 2016).\nThe finite-element mesh is composed of eight-node hexahedral elements, with their size ranging from approximately 0.3\u00a0km on the fault trace to 5\u201310\u00a0km at the bottom and sides of the model. The model presents a discontinuity in the mesh, indicated by the green (No. 1) and red (No. 2) planes in Fig. 3, which is intended to simulate the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake causative fault plane. The fault presents a strike and dip of approximately 130\u00b0 and 47\u00b0, respectively (Atzori et al., 2009), and is composed by two subplanes that simulate the steady-shearing (No. 1 in Fig. 3) and stick-slip behaviour (No. 2 in Fig. 3) of the fault. The fault extent at depth is limited to approximately 15\u00a0km because of the presence of a decollement level, i.e., the Latium-Abruzzi extensional detachment (Lavecchia et al., 2017), which delimitates the SW dipping intra-Apennines active faults of Central Italy. The transition between the brittle and plastic behaviour of the fault plane is at approximately 10\u00a0km depth, according to the location of the hypocentres of the foreshocks and the mainshock (Chiaraluce et al., 2011; Valoroso et al., 2013). Therefore, the red (No. 2) and green (No. 1) segments present an along-dip length of approximately 12\u00a0km (D1) and 8\u00a0km (D2), respectively. The fault behaviour is modelled assuming a frictional contact interface between the two walls of the discontinuity, where the nodes are doubled so that the footwall and the hanging wall of the fault can move relative to each other, according to the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion:\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c4\n=\n\u2212\n\u03c3\n\u03bc\n\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the shear stress, \u03c3 is the normal stress (assumed positive when tensile), and \u03bc is the friction coefficient.\nUnlike conventional kinematic models, no forces or displacements are imposed on the fault edges (No. 1 and 2 in Fig. 3) to induce slip. Instead, the walls of the fault plane are assumed alternatively locked or unlocked in space and time (Doglioni et al., 2011, 2014). No self-consistent failure criterion, e.g., rate-and-state friction (Ruina, 1983; Aharonov and Scholz, 2018), is assumed on the fault plane, but the timing of fault rupture is imposed a-priori. In detail, the locked and unlocked condition is attained by manually changing the friction coefficient at the interface. In case of a locked fault, the friction coefficient assumes a large value, i.e., 0.7 (Byerlee, 1978) to avoid the relative movement between the nodes belonging to the footwall and hanging wall. In case of an unlocked fault, friction is set to a low value (0.05) (Di Toro et al., 2011) to simulate the interseismic viscous sliding of the deep fault segment (No. 1 in Fig. 3) and the coseismic dislocation of the upper fault segment (No. 2 in Fig. 3). When unlocked, nodes along the fault edges move each other under the drive of the applied far-field boundary conditions, forces, and internal stress. This approach allows investigating the different stress and strain distributions associated with the interseismic and coseismic phases, rather than assessing what processes control the timing of rupture.\nA linear elastic isotropic model describes the evolution of stress and strain within the medium. The complex geology of the study area is simplified into two layers (Fig. 3). Such a simplification is consistent with the first-order nature of the performed modelling. The elastic and state parameters come from literature data and geophysical measurements available over the study area (Carannante et al., 2013). The assumed values are reported in Table 1\n and are consistent with those adopted in related case studies in Italy (Trasatti et al., 2011; Albano et al., 2015; Finocchio et al., 2016; Castaldo et al., 2018; Tung and Masterlark, 2018).\n\n\n2.2\nSimulation phases and model validation\nSimulations present an interseismic phase and a coseismic phase. The mechanical boundary conditions are activated at the beginning of the analysis, while the applied forces and locking status for the fault segments are specified in Table 2\n for each phase.\nThe interseismic phase mimics the accumulation of the long-term pre-earthquake stress and strain field in the crust resulting from the applied gravitational and basal shear forces and boundary conditions. The analysis type is elastic and lasts for one loading step, within a single numerical increment. In this way, the viscoelastic behaviour of the lower crust is neglected, thus focusing on the cumulated interseismic stress and strain field only, rather than assessing the shape of the loading path. This phase presents two sub-stages. In the first stage, the model self-consolidates under gravity only (green arrows in Fig. 3). Both the fault surfaces are unlocked (No. 1 and No. 2 in Table 2 and Fig. 3) so that the footwall and the hanging wall can move relative to each other, accommodating the lithostatic load. In the second stage, the basal shear tractions are activated (blue arrows in Fig. 3) to simulate the interseismic tectonic loading. The deep fault plane is kept unlocked (No. 1 in Fig. 3) to simulate a fault that steadily shears during the interseismic phase (Doglioni et al., 2011; Scholz, 2019), while the upper fault plane is locked (No. 2 in Fig. 3) to simulate a fault asperity during the tectonic loading.\nNotice that in extensional tectonic settings, the state of stress within the crust is always compressive below about 1\u00a0km due to the confining pressure exerted by the lithostatic load. In other words, as classically depicted by the state of stress in extensional settings, the maximum stress (\u03c31) is vertical, and the minimum stress (\u03c33) is horizontal but still positive (i.e., contractional) beneath 1\u00a0km depth (Bignami et al., 2020). Therefore, the stress determining the activation of the downward motion of the hanging wall volume is given by the lithostatic load (i.e., gravity). For these basic observations, the normal faulting cannot be considered as generated by an elastic rebound, but rather by the gravitational collapse of the hanging wall (Bignami et al., 2020). Due to this difference, Doglioni et al. (2015) proposed the nomenclature of graviquakes for normal-fault earthquakes.\nThe coseismic phase lasts for one loading step within a single numerical increment to calculate the coseismic deformation induced by the unlocking the upper fault plane (No. 2 in Fig. 3), while the lower fault plane (No. 1 in Fig. 3) is locked. Both the mechanical boundary conditions and forces applied in the interseismic phase are still active in this phase.\nPreliminary models highlight that stress, strain, and ground displacements in interseismic and coseismic phases rely on the magnitude of the applied basal shear traction and the extent of the locked and unlocked portions of the fault plane. Otherwise, the rheological properties of the medium play a minor role (Doglioni et al., 2014). Therefore, the model performance has been established by carrying on a trial-and-error procedure with a parametric analysis to search for the combination of the amplitude of the applied shear traction (blue arrows in Fig. 3) and the along-strike length of locked and unlocked fault planes (L in Fig. 3) that fits the coseismic ground displacements observed with the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique.\nThe quality of the modelled solution is then evaluated by estimating the root mean square error (RMSE) of the residuals between the observed and modelled displacements, expressed as follows:\n\n(2)\n\nRMSE\n=\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\ni\n,\nobs\n\n\n\u2212\n\ny\n\ni\n,\nmod\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere y\n\ni,obs\n and y\n\ni,mod\n are the observed and modelled displacements of the ith points and N the number of points.\n\n\n2.3\nInSAR data and processing\nThe coseismic displacements caused by the earthquake have been investigated with InSAR data from the ENVISAT satellite mission. Pre- and post-event images were acquired on 11 March and 15 April 2009 along the ascending orbit, and on 20 July 2007 and 12 April 2009 along the descending orbit. The ascending and descending unwrapped coseismic interferograms are computed by applying the classical InSAR technique (Massonnet and Feigl, 1998) using the GAMMA\u00a9 SAR software package (Wegmuller et al., 1998). The topographic phase has been removed from the interferograms by using the SRTM 1-arc sec Digital Elevation Model (Farr et al., 2007), while phase noise filtering (Goldstein and Werner, 1998) has been applied to the wrapped interferograms using the Minimum Cost Flow algorithm (Costantini, 1998). A multi-look factor has been applied to achieve a final ground pixel resolution of about 30\u00a0m, in agreement with the SRTM resolution cell.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nThe description of the results of the numerical simulations refers to the best-fit model. They are presented in terms of differential displacement, stress, and strain fields in the interseismic and coseismic phases, respectively.\n\n3.1\nInterseismic phase\nAt the end of the interseismic phase, the lithostatic load produces horizontal and vertical stress distributions that increase almost linearly with depth and are compressive at every depth in the model.\nThe basal shear tractions, with an amplitude of approximately 1.6\u00a0MPa, modify the horizontal stress and strain field along the x-direction. In detail, the SW part of the model experiences horizontal stress relaxation and extension (Fig. 4a and b), while the NE part experiences stress increase and contraction. Such stress and strain changes adequately simulate the tectonic stretching of the Central Apennines area and the compression of the Adriatic offshore (Fig. 1a). The fault plane that simulates the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake (red and grey planes in Fig. 4) is located in an extensional tectonic field.\nThe resulting horizontal displacement along the x-direction (Fig. 4c) is NE-directed (orange arrows) and is constant along the z-direction. Horizontal movements are null at the model sides because of the assumed horizontal constraints, then gradually increase towards the centre, with a maximum value of approximately 900\u00a0cm.\nThe modelled interseismic horizontal displacements at the ground surface along the x-direction (Fig. 4c) were scaled relative to time and compared with the horizontal interseismic ground velocities from GPS data (Fig. 1a and c). Fig. 5\n shows the comparison between the calculated equivalent horizontal velocity profile at the ground level along the A-A' cross-section in Fig. 1a (red curve) and the horizontal velocities from the GPS stations (blue circles) comprised by the model footprint in Fig. 1a, and projected along the x-direction, together with 1-\u03c3 confidence error bars. Assuming a time factor of approximately 1900\u00a0years yields a fair fit between the observed and modelled velocities, with an RMSE of about 1.3\u00a0mm\/year. The spatial long-wavelength velocity trend of the GPS data is well captured by the model, which adequately reproduces the nearly NE-directed GPS velocity increase in the Central Apennines and the maximum GPS velocity. However, the homogenous model does not capture short-wavelength velocity variations in the GPS data. These are likely associated with geometrical and rheological heterogeneities in the upper crust (Finocchio et al., 2016).\nAt the brittle-plastic transition (i.e., at the transition between the locked and unlocked fault planes), the interseismic shearing of the deep fault plane (the plane No. 1 in Fig. 3) determines a rotation of stress and strain axes. The interseismic displacement pattern and vectors (Fig. 6a), cleared of the large-scale interseismic displacements of Fig. 4c, show the interseismic normal dislocation of the lower fault plane. Displacements are SE-directed and reach maximum values close to the shearing fault, while gradually reduce moving aside. A small amount of deformation is also detected at the ground level. Such interseismic displacements induce dilation at depth in the hanging wall, at the transition between the locked and unlocked fault planes (positive volumetric strains in Fig. 6b), while volumetric contraction develops in the shallow most two-kilometre of the hanging wall because of the interseismic ground subsidence caused by the shearing of the deep fault plane, and in the footwall because of its mainly NE-ward movement (negative values in Fig. 6b).\nStress variations, expressed in terms of Coulomb stress changes (\u0394CFS) (Fig. 6c), calculated along preferential NW-SE trending planes dipping 47\u00b0 towards SW (corresponding to the dip of the segment No. 2 in Fig. 3) and with \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.6 (Byerlee, 1978), show that the locked fault segment falls within a positive \u2206CFS volume, where extensional earthquakes are promoted.\n\n\n3.2\nCoseismic phase\nIn the coseismic phase, the earthquake dislocation occurs by unlocking the shallower part of the fault (No. 2 in Fig. 3). The coseismic deformation pattern (Fig. 6d) highlights the down and SW-ward movement of the hanging wall and the mainly NE-ward movement of the footwall, consistently with geodetic observations and analytical or numerical models (Atzori et al., 2009; Trasatti et al., 2011). The coseismic fault slip is directed downdip (Fig. S1) with maximum values of approximately 90\u00a0cm reached about 6\u201310\u00a0km at depth. The geodetic moment tensor computed from the retrieved slip distribution, the fault area and the stiffness, is about 1.61\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01018\u00a0Nm, corresponding to a magnitude of approximately 6.1. The coseismic dislocation induces the volumetric contraction of the hanging wall at the brittle-plastic transition (Fig. 6e), thus recovering the volumetric dilation accumulated in the interseismic phase (Fig. 6b). A complex pattern of dilated and compressed volumes occurs in the shallow most 1\u20132\u00a0km due to the combination of subsidence and south-westward movement of the hanging wall. Conversely, the footwall experiences dilation at the brittle plastic transition that relaxes the interseismic volumetric contraction, while contraction develops in the upper part because of the mainly horizontal movement of footwall induced by the hanging wall downward movement. The coseismic \u0394CFS pattern (Fig. 6f) shows increasing stresses at the fault tips and is consistent with those calculated with conventional analytical approaches (Serpelloni et al., 2012).\nThe modelled coseismic displacements at the ground level (Fig. 6d) have been projected along the ascending and descending line of sight (LOS) of the ENVISAT satellites and compared with the corresponding InSAR observations. The InSAR-derived displacement pattern (Fig. 7a), showing the predominant subsidence of the hanging wall (negative values) and the mainly eastward movement of the footwall (positive values), is well resolved by the model (Fig. 7b). Indeed, the residuals between modelled and measured displacements (Fig. 7c) are less than 3\u00a0cm. At the same time, the computed RMSE is less than 10% of the maximum observed displacements, and it is comparable with the results of finite-fault dislocation models available in the literature (Atzori et al., 2009; Trasatti et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThe proposed numerical approach allowed us to model the interseismic and the coseismic phases associated with the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake. The adopted model setting (boundary conditions, loads, and fault geometry) generates dominant gravitational and tectonic forces that are compatible with the tectonic setting of Central Apennines in Italy. The applied basal shear tractions (Fig. 3) are suitable to model the large-scale interseismic displacement. These tractions allow for a first-order description of the ongoing crustal interseismic stretching of the Central Apennines and the compression of the Adriatic foreland (Figs. 1a, 4 and 5) (Barba et al., 2008; Carminati and Doglioni, 2012; Galadini et al., 2012; Carafa et al., 2015).\nIn the presence of crustal heterogeneities, i.e., a fault with a different shearing behaviour between its upper and lower part (Fig. 3), the concurrent action of shear tractions and the gravity force cause the normal dislocation of the unlocked portion of the fault (Fig. 6a). This generates an accumulation of interseismic stress and strain in a crustal volume at the transition between the locked and unlocked fault planes (Figs. 6b). Such stress and strain partitioning can be considered to control the activation of the seismogenic fault portion. The ongoing stretching at the brittle-plastic transition gradually increases the \u0394CFS all over a volume that contains the seismogenic fault plane (Fig. 6c) until reaching the failure strength of the brittle upper part of the fault plane. Thus, in our interpretation, the existence of the basal tractions favours the occurrence of large normal-faulting earthquakes. When the failure threshold is met, the brittle part of the fault is unlocked and generates a sudden downward and SW-ward movement of the hanging wall, with a predominantly NE-ward movement of the footwall (Fig. 6d). The fault dislocation (Fig. S1) causes the hanging wall release and the reversal of the interseismic stress and strain patterns. The dilated volume, formed during the interseismic phase, shortens during the coseismic stage (Fig. 6e) and the coseismic stress increase compensates the interseismic stress relaxation at depth.\nThe modelled fault kinematics depends on the interseismic crustal stress and strain fields resulting from the applied boundary conditions and loads in the far-field. Such an approach differs from conventional kinematic models, where the fault mechanism is imposed by applying forces or displacements directly along the fault edges to fit geodetic or seismological data, regardless of the tectonic setting. Nevertheless, our approach is equally capable of simulating the observed coseismic scenarios. Indeed, the modelled coseismic displacements effectively reproduce the InSAR observations (Fig. 7), with residuals comparable with those obtained from kinematic models. The computed slip distribution (Fig. S1) is similar to that obtained by analytical and numerical models (Atzori et al., 2009; Trasatti et al., 2011; Castaldo et al., 2018), while the estimated geodetic moment tensor and magnitude are slightly lower than those estimated from instrumental seismicity. Such a discrepancy is related to the adopted forward modelling approach, which is not intended to search for a best-fit of the available geodetic measurements but to assess the stress and strain field before earthquake dislocation. In this sense, the obtained simple slip distribution cannot provide any clues about the source directivity or the asymmetric position of the earthquake epicentre with respect to the L'Aquila 2009 fault plane (Fig. 1b).\nBoth amplitude and shape of the coseismic displacement field (Fig. 6d) depend on the magnitude of applied basal shear tractions (Fig. 3), i.e., the larger the applied force is, the higher is the amplitude of the coseismic displacements. Therefore, the basal shear force can be viewed as the accumulated interseismic loading that is required to break an asperity located in the upper brittle fault portion and to generate an earthquake of a given magnitude. The shear traction amplitude depends on the assumed modelling hypotheses; thus, it cannot be interpreted in absolute terms. Nonetheless, we can analyse the time factor, i.e., approximately 1900\u00a0years, obtained by fitting the modelled interseismic horizontal displacements with the horizontal ground velocities from GPS data (Fig. 5). This time factor can be interpreted as an approximate estimate of the time required to generate an earthquake of a specified magnitude on the same fault segment. This time-factor links the coseismic displacements with the interseismic ground velocity and does not depend on the model parameters. A comparison with the literature shows that the computed time-factor resembles with the typical recurrence time interval for normal fault earthquakes in Central Italy with magnitudes ranging between 5.6 and 7.0, i.e., approximately 1200\u20133000\u00a0years, inferred from slip rates and average displacement measurements (DISS Working Group, 2018; Galadini and Galli, 2000; Galli et al., 2008). However, the modelled time-factor does not consider the effect of earthquake interaction, which could anticipate, but also delay, the occurrence of an earthquake on a specific fault segment by several hundred years in Central Italy, according to Wedmore et al. (2017).\nThe assumed abrupt transition between the shallow and deep fault planes (Fig. 3) mimics a much more complex behaviour of the shear zone. Indeed, a broad transition generally exists between the unstable and stable sliding of the fault, and between its brittle and plastic behaviour, as a function of pressure and temperature gradients and rheological parameters (see Scholz (2019) and references therein). Moreover, we assumed a finite length for the creeping fault plane (the green plane No. 1 in Fig. 3). This approximation produces numerical artefacts such as the stress and strain lobes that develop at the lower tip of the shearing fault plane (Fig. 6b and c). These lobes, which are symmetrical and opposite in sign respect to those that develop at the transition between the locked and unlocked fault planes, are caused by the assumed along-dip finite length of the fault. However, such an approximation does not affect the general validity of the obtained results.\nOur modelling approach aims at assessing the long-term interseismic stress and strain pattern before an earthquake rather than analysing the trend and shape of the loading path until the earthquake nucleation. In particular, the interseismic phase simulates the accumulation of stress and strain regardless of time, neglecting the viscous-plastic behaviour of geomaterials and the coupling between the solid and fluid phase. Modelling these aspects is not straightforward since it requires knowing several parameters, such as the tectonic strain-rate and the hydraulic properties of the medium, the latter being strongly heterogeneous and anisotropic at seismogenic depth (Gleeson and Ingebritsen, 2012).\nHowever, the proposed approach provides an overall picture of the accumulated stress and strain fields before the earthquake. In particular, the most significant results of our model are the computed volumetric strain and \u0394CFS at the end of the interseismic phase (Fig. 6b and c). Interseismic volumetric strains comply with some geophysical and geodetic signals observed before the earthquake nucleation. In detail, i) the dilating and contracting volumes (Fig. 8a) roughly correspond with the volumes where respectively low and high Vp\/Vs anomalies were detected before the earthquake (see Fig. 4 in Lucente et al. (2010)), and ii) the dilating volume in the hanging wall is located approximately below the Pizzoli e Preturo Quaternary basins (Fig. 8a), where accelerating ground subsidence was detected with satellite data, three years before the mainshock (see Fig. 1 in Moro et al. (2017)).\nThe interseismic \u0394CFS pattern agrees with the spatial distribution of seismicity registered before the mainshock in the period of January\u2013March 2009 (Chiaraluce et al., 2011) (Fig. 1b). In particular, approximately 89% of the foreshocks falls in volumes where the \u0394CFS is positive (red spheres in Fig. 8b). Such a percentage increases to around 95% considering the \u0394CFS on preferential NW-SE trending fault planes and dipping 50\u00b0 to the NE, i.e., antithetic to the mainshock causative fault (Fig. S2), consistent with the fact that some of the foreshocks developed along a secondary antithetic fault plane (Chiaraluce et al., 2011).\nThese correspondences allow portraying a unified sketch of the phenomena likely occurred before the L'Aquila 2009 mainshock. During the interseismic phase, the continuous shearing of the deep fault plane (No. 1 in Fig. 3) determines the growth of dilated and compressed volumes at depth in the hanging wall and footwall, respectively, and the increase in shear stresses on the mainshock causative fault and secondary antithetic planes (Fig. 6c and Fig. S2). The progressive accumulation of dilatancy and shear stresses presupposes crack growth by tensile-opening and in-plane shear fractures in the hanging wall (Scholz, 2019), which triggered foreshocks (Chiaraluce et al., 2011). The latter developed from January 2009, with an increasing seismicity rate and a decreasing b-value (Gulia et al., 2016; Sugan et al., 2014). Foreshocks were also accompanied by slow slip events (Borghi et al., 2016) that reflect the progressive stress increase on synthetic and antithetic planes surrounding an impending rupture zone (Fig. 8b), caused by the differential slip behaviour of the brittle and plastic fault planes (Sugan et al., 2014).\nIn the presence of voids filled with fluids (Fyfe, 2012), volumetric changes imply a variation in the void space of the solid and a contextual modification in the fluid pore pressures respect to the hydrostatic, especially in case of the presence of low permeability strata (Lucente et al., 2010; Doglioni et al., 2014). Thus, two different compartments develop; one of dilatant material in the hanging wall block, filled with pore fluids at sub-hydrostatic pressure and another one of contracted material in the footwall block, filled with highly pressurized fluid, with the fault acting as an impermeable seal separating them (Fig. 8a) (Bense et al., 2013; Lucente et al., 2010). This scenario explains the low and high VP\/VS ratios detected in the hanging wall and footwall, respectively (Lucente et al., 2010; Terakawa et al., 2010). Pore pressure gradients could trigger fluid flow into the hanging wall volume from deep overpressurized CO2 rich zones, as postulated by Chiodini et al. (2004). If the fluid diffusion is steady, it could affect the surficial phreatic aquifers inside Quaternary basins, thus lowering the groundwater table and causing soil consolidation, as observed in the Preturo and Pizzoli basins (Moro et al., 2017), which are located in the hanging wall and approximately above the dilated volume (Fig. 8a). Otherwise, the diffusion could be abrupt because of the rupture of a permeability barrier, as supposed by Lucente et al. (2010) after the nucleation of the 30 March 2009, Mw 4.0 foreshock. This event could lead to a fluid pressure pulse from the contracted volume of the footwall into the dilated volume of the hanging wall, thus explaining the observed sharp changes in the VP\/VS ratio in the hanging wall and footwall observed one week before the mainshock (Baccheschi et al., 2019; Lucente et al., 2010), the concurrent abrupt modifications of seismicity rate and b-value (Gulia et al., 2016), and the triggering of the mainshock.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe results of the performed numerical model provide a quantitative description of the interseismic stress and strain pattern at seismogenic depth before the earthquake nucleation along normal faults as proposed by Bignami et al. (2020). Modelling of the interseismic phase shows evidence of interseismic dilatancy at depth in the hanging wall, in a volume embedding the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake hypocentre, while volumetric contraction develops in the footwall. Such volumetric changes provide a quantitative description of the geophysical and geodetic signals observed before the mainshock, i.e., the Vp\/Vs anomalies and the ground subsidence observed with satellite data. Moreover, the partitioning of the interseismic \u0394CFS stress at the transition between the brittle and plastic fault segments promotes the coseismic dislocation of the hanging wall and agrees with the spatial distribution of foreshocks detected before the mainshock nucleation.\nThe modelled interseismic stress and strain patterns invert during the coseismic stage. The dilated volume, formed during the interseismic phase, will be contracted and, conversely, the volume in the footwall that was previously contracted will be expanded.\n\n\nData availability\nThe results of the numerical model, expressed in terms of nodal stresses, strains and displacements, are available at the following link: doi:https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.3950811, a data repository hosted at www.zenodo.org.\n\n","285":"","286":"","287":"","288":"","289":"","290":"","291":"","292":"","293":"","294":"","295":"","296":"","297":"","298":"","299":""},"Creator":{"0":["Xiong, Wei","Chen, Wei","Wang, Dongzhen","Wen, Yangmao","Nie, Zhaosheng","Liu, Gang","Dijin, Wang","Yu, Pengfei","Qiao, Xuejun","Zhao, Bin"],"1":["Su, Wenbo","He, Zhiyuan","Zhong, Linglin","Glorie, Stijn","Zhong, Kanghui","Jepson, Gilby","De Grave, Johan"],"2":["Ma, Lixue","Xu, Tao","Ai, Yinshuang","Yang, Jinhui","Yang, Yingjie","Fan, Enbo","Li, Long","Hou, Jue","Dong, Weiyu"],"3":["Chizzini, Nicol\u00f2","Artoni, Andrea","Torelli, Luigi","Basso, Jessica","Polonia, Alina","Gasperini, Luca"],"4":["Li, Xianrui","Gao, Ke","Feng, Yu","Zhang, Chongyuan"],"5":["Lyu, Mingzhe","Chen, Kejie","Xue, Changhu","Zang, Nan","Zhang, Wei","Wei, Guoguang"],"6":["Li, Bingshuai","Yan, Maodu","Zhang, Weilin","Fang, Xiaomin","Yang, Yongpeng","Zhang, Dawen","Guan, Chong","Bao, Jing"],"7":["Zhang, Guangwei","Li, Yujiang","Hu, Xingping"],"8":["Kolawole, Folarin","Vick, Travis","Atekwana, Estella A.","La\u00f3-D\u00e1vila, Daniel A.","Costa, Aristides G.","Carpenter, Brett M."],"9":["Kong, Weilin","Huang, Luyuan","Yao, Rui","Yang, Shuxin"],"10":["Liu, Chang","Shi, Yaolin"],"11":["Zhang, Zhengyi","Luan, Xiwu","Tian, Fanfan","Ran, Weimin","Zhang, Liang","Dong, Dongdong","Sun, Weidong"],"12":["Liu, Shaolin","Chang, Kai","Yang, Dinghui","Xu, Xiwei","Wang, Wenshuai","Yang, Shuxin","Li, Mengyang"],"13":["Zhang, Yingfeng","Gong, Wenyu","Shan, Xinjian","Wang, Chisheng"],"14":["Wei, Jie","Wang, An","Lyu, Ganyu","Liu, Yanyuan","Li, Haoruo","Shen, Tianyi","Wang, Guocan"],"15":["Kim, Jae Hoon","Ree, Jin-Han","Hirose, Takehiro","Oohashi, Kiyokazu"],"16":["Parrino, Nicol\u00f2","Pepe, Fabrizio","Burrato, Pierfrancesco","Dardanelli, Gino","Corradino, Marta","Pipitone, Claudia","Morticelli, Maurizio Gasparo","Sulli, Attilio","Di Maggio, Cipriano"],"17":["Ren, Chunmei","Yue, Han","Cao, Bonan","Zhu, Yifan","Wang, Teng","An, Chao","Ge, Zengxi","Li, Zhen"],"18":["Doski, Jamal A.H.","McClay, Ken"],"19":["Dal Zilio, Luca","Hegyi, Betti","Behr, Whitney","Gerya, Taras"],"20":["Peikert, Jill","Hampel, Andrea","Bagge, Meike"],"21":["Mulibo, Gabriel D."],"22":["Yi, Ziyuan","Guo, Zhaojie","Wei, Guoqi"],"23":["Ma, Shuo"],"24":["Wang, Yu","Zuo, Renguang","Cao, Kai","Xu, Xianbing","Zattin, Massimiliano"],"25":["Fahrudin, ","Chhun, Chanmaly","Tsuji, Takeshi"],"26":["S\u00e1nchez-Barra, Abril C.","Gonz\u00e1lez-Escobar, Mario","Ferrari, Luca"],"27":["Feng, Zhentian","Chu, Yang","Wei, Wei","Lin, Wei","Xin, Guangyao","Wang, Yin","Qiu, Huabiao","Ren, Zhiheng"],"28":["Zielke, Olaf","Benedetti, Lucilla","Mai, Paul Martin","Fleury, Jules","Rizza, Magali","Viseur, Sophie"],"29":["Liu, Dongliang","Ferr\u00e9, Eric C.","Li, Haibing","Chou, Yu-Min","Wang, Huan","Horng, Chorng-Shern","Sun, Zhiming","Pan, Jiawei","Chevalier, Marie-Luce","Zheng, Yong","Ge, Chenglong","Liu, Fucai"],"30":["Yi, Xiangcheng","Ye, Gaofeng","Jin, Sheng","Wei, Wenbo"],"31":["Taymaz, Tuncay","Ganas, Athanassios","Berberian, Manuel","Eken, Tuna","Irmak, T.

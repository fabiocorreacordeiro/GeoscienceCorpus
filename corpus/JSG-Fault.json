In this study we analyze a series of small-wavelength (meters to tens of meters) folds in roadcut exposures northwest of Del Rio, Texas. The folds have WNW-ESE dominant trends, gently plunging axes, and are gentle to tight with upright to inclined axial surfaces of variable vergence. These structures are interpreted as detachment folds, with detachments within volcanic ash or mudrock beds. Observed thickening in anticline cores was by ductile flow of volcanic ash or mudrock, small-scale folding, and thrust or reverse faulting. Bed-perpendicular calcite veins are common and in some cases are offset by flexural slip on fold limbs, indicating that folding occurred after brittle failure and extension vein formation in lithified rock. Although rare, bed-parallel calcite veins are also present in the exposure and indicative of a thrust faulting stress regime. Occasional normal and reverse or thrust faults are also present in the exposures. Fluid inclusion analysis of vein cements from extension fractures and faults yielded homogenization temperatures of 71\u2013101\u00a0\u00b0C, and estimated trapping depths of 2.2\u20133.5\u00a0km prior to and coeval with folding. We interpret these folds as having formed during NNE-SSW directed Laramide shortening (\u223c80\u201340\u00a0Ma) in a thrust-faulting stress regime with >2\u00a0km of overburden, rather than as either penecontemporaneous with deposition or after exhumation by caliche formation, as previously interpreted.\n               ","1":"\n                  The occurrence of Middle Triassic extensional and strike-slip tectonics has been widely recognized in the Dolomites and is supported by stratigraphic evidence. Contrarily, the recognition of Triassic contractional tectonic structures is less straightforward because such structures were heavily superimposed by Neogene Alpine shortening.\n                  In this work we provide a detailed analysis of a top-class outcrop displaying a syn-sedimentary Middle Triassic extensional fault that displaces a coeval sedimentary m\u00e9lange containing an olistholith of Lower Triassic rocks, characterized by Triassic contractional structures (folds, axial plane cleavage, joints, local thrust faults ornamented with slickenfibers and associated with forced folds).\n                  In particular, integrating geological field mapping and structural analyses, structural analyses on a 3D virtual outcrop model and microstructural analyses, we demonstrate that: 1) the orientation of tectonic structures in the olistholith is at odd with that of regional structures, implying that deformation occurred prior to deposition of the melange; 2) folds and small-scale thrusts in the olistholith developed in lithified rocks, pointing to the existence of Middle Triassic fold and thrust tectonics. In summary, the tectonic structures in the analyzed olistholith represent an outstanding, possibly unique, example of fully preserved, practically frozen, Middle Triassic contractional structures.\n               ","2":"\n                  Feldspar dominates the middle and lower continental crust. Models of crustal rheology depend on our knowledge of feldspar deformation mechanisms. To learn more about natural feldspar deformation, we conducted a multidisciplinary investigation of a brittle-ductile transition (BDT) hosted within a Cretaceous pluton in the Colorado River Extensional Corridor, southern Nevada. Here, a distinct BDT was observed at \u223c10\u00a0km paleo-depth, where brittle faulting transitioned to discrete, localized ductile shearing. Field relationships confirm this BDT to have deformed and exhumed in the Miocene, temporally associated with the intrusion of two surrounding ca. 16 Ma plutons and subsequent footwall rotation in an east-directed normal-fault system. We established the overall structural framework, strain rates, and thermal histories through field traverses, aluminum-in-hornblende barometry to reconstruct paleo-depth, zircon (U\u2013Th)\/He thermochronology (ZHe) to constrain temperature-time histories, and 1D thermal models to further resolve deformation temperatures. Localized shear zones within the BDT formed ca. 16.2\u201315.5\u00a0Ma at temperatures of \u223c500\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C, which continued deforming as they cooled both conductively and advectively to \u223c200\u00a0\u00b0C by ca. 14 Ma, as constrained by ZHe dates. Strain was concentrated in fine-grained (7\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) feldspar-rich ultramylonites that were interpreted to have primarily deformed via grain-size-sensitive diffusion creep. Grain-size reduction that allowed activation of diffusion creep likely resulted from brittle cataclasis, fluid-assisted fracturing and neocrystallization, and dislocation creep mechanisms, thus emphasizing the importance of these processes to localize deformation at relatively strong mid-crust conditions to facilitate the development of diffusion-creep shear zones. Grain-size piezometers suggest stresses of \u223c50\u00a0MPa, which are significantly weaker than peak strength in quartz-rich BDTs that deform via dislocation creep. This integrated process allows relatively low viscosities (\u223c1018\u20131019\u00a0Pa\u00a0s) at lower crust temperatures and explains a coherent process of strain localization at near-BDT conditions in feldspar-dominated lithologies. We suggest that this naturally deformed feldspar shear zone was preserved due to the unique geologic history with fast heating and exhumation, which froze both brittle vs crystal-plastic structures to provide valuable insights into mechanisms of feldspar deformation.\n               ","3":"\n                  Wing fractures and solution surfaces formed in the vicinity of sliding fault tips are natural examples of mixed-mode fracture propagation. Classical fracture propagation models neglect the remote and crack frictional stresses and have limitations on estimating the kink angles of wing fractures from frictional interfaces under compression. Other methods, utilizing the cohesive end zone, improve the match with the field observations. However, limitations still exist for predicting the angles of wing fractures and solution surfaces simultaneously.\n                  We analyze the near-tip stress field including the non-singular terms to estimate the kink angles of wing fracture and solution surface. The estimated kink angles of wing fractures from closed fractures are smaller than the angles from open fractures, agreeing well with the experimental results. The introduced approach predicts that the greater the friction coefficient the smaller the kink angle. The predicted angle between a wing fracture and a solution surface varies between 90\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 depending on the remote stress ratio and the friction coefficient. From the published image of wing fractures and stylolites in limestone in Southern France, we were able to estimate the friction coefficient of the sliding faults and the relative magnitude of the horizontal stresses.\n               ","4":"\n                  Fault-propagation folding occurs when a shallow fold is created by an underlying propagating thrust fault. These structures are common features of fold and thrust belts and hold key economic relevance as groundwater or hydrocarbon reservoirs. Reconstructing a fault-propagation fold is commonly done by means of the trishear model of the forelimb, a theoretical approach that assumes simplistic rheological rock properties. Here we present a series of numerical models that elucidate the kinematics of fault-propagation folding within an anisotropic sedimentary cover using complex visco-elasto-plastic rheologies. We explore the influence of different parameters like cohesion, angle of internal friction, and viscosity during folding and compare the velocity field with results from the purely kinematic trishear model. In the trishear paradigm, fault-propagation folding features a triangular shear zone ahead of the fault tip whose width is defined by the apical angle that in practice serves as a freely tunable fitting parameter. In agreement with this framework, a triangular zone of concentrated strain forms in all numerical models. We use our models to relate the apical angle to the rheological properties of the modeled sedimentary layers. In purely visco-plastic models, the geometry of the forelimb obtained can be approximated using a trishear kinematic model with high apical angles ranging between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0. However, additionally accounting for elastic deformation produces a significant change in the geometry of the beds that require lower apical angles (25\u00b0) for trishear kinematics. We conclude that all analyzed numerical models can be represented by applying the theoretical trishear model, whereby folds involving salt layers require high apical angle values while more competent sedimentary rocks need lower values.\n               ","5":"\n                  In carbonates, fault zones strongly influence local reservoir properties and act as drains or barriers to flows. In the case of reactivated faults, newly developed fracture and fault systems rework and cross-cut pre-existing fault structures. The modifications of initial damage zone and fault core properties alter the fault zone properties and potentially created new fluid pathways. This study of the polyphase Castellas fault zone, developed as normal and later reactivated as strike slip, characterizes the structural pattern related to tectonic reactivation, and estimates the hydraulic behaviour of the fault zone through time. This fault affects carbonates located on La Fare anticlinal (SE France). High resolution mapping, 848 measurements and cross-sections allowed to discriminate the fault structures and the lateral heterogeneity of its architecture. Along the 850m-long studied damage zone we identify 8 principal fault planes, 2 relay zones, 19 secondary fault planes, and fault lenses. The study shows that the fault zone developed as isolated fault segments during the normal activity and acted as a drain to fluid flows during its nucleation. Later strike-slip reactivation led to the main structures visible presently as a well-connected fracture network and un-cemented breccia allowing the fault to be a drain to fluid flows.\n               ","6":"\n                  To investigate mechanisms causing microseismicity (Mw\u00a0<\u00a02) at a CO2 injection site, a large-scale triaxial block experiment was carried out on a faulted (saw-cut) cubic-meter of Castlegate Sandstone. The experiment consisted of injection tests at varying differential stresses, while monitoring and recording pore pressure and acoustic emissions (AEs). During the experiment, \u223c33,000 AEs and \u223c14\u00a0mm of horizontal displacement\/slip, like a strike-slip fault movement, occurred. To understand the AE responses and ascertain fault characteristics near the located AEs, we modeled the topography of the fault surface, fault aperture, and fault-gouge thickness using pre- and post-experiment laser scans of the fault surface on each half of the block. Additionally, we characterized surface roughness parallel and perpendicular to slip. Models show crushing and flattening of the fault surfaces can be linked to the spatiotemporal distribution of AEs within 50\u00a0mm of the fault surface. Approximately 65% of AEs were in areas with small aperture (\u2264300\u00a0\u03bcm); thicker fault gouge was observed in adjacent areas with wider aperture and shows a two-fold reduction in grain size relative to unaltered Castlegate Sandstone. This work provides a conceptual understanding on fault surface evolution, which can be applied towards modeling of seismic slip.\n               ","7":"\n                  We report on a series of small-scale, en-\u00e9chelon faults in limestone (Les Matelles, France) that result in the formation of a series of linked pull-aparts (en-\u00e9chelon pull-apart arrays) that have been infilled with calcite. The formation of stylolite seams and isolated veins occurs adjacent to these fault zones, which constrain the direction of minimum infinitesimal stretching axis (commonly interpreted as maximum compressional stress). We observe that en-\u00e9chelon pull-apart arrays occur when the maximum infinitesimal shortening direction is at 55\u00b0 or greater to the enveloping surfaces of the en-\u00e9chelon fault arrays. This situation differs from en-\u00e9chelon vein arrays, in which the maximum horizontal infinitesimal shortening direction occurs at 55\u00b0 or less to the enveloping surfaces. We interpret these features with respect to transpressional strain modeling, which distinguishes between wrench (simple shear) dominated transpression and pure shear dominated transpression. Pure shear dominated transpression occurs if the maximum infinitesimal shortening direction is at 55\u00b0 or greater to the enveloping surfaces, and results in a maximum infinitesimal stretching direction that is vertical. The formation of en-\u00e9chelon vein arrays with vertical enveloping surfaces require a horizontal infinitesimal stretching direction, which is incompatible with pure shear dominated transpression. Rather, en-\u00e9chelon pull-apart arrays form to accommodate the wrench component of deformation in pure-shear dominated transpression.\n               ","8":"\n                  Fault zones in crystalline rocks generally possess a relatively narrow (<50-cm-thick) fault core (i.e., a fault gouge layer\/zone). However, the Geumwang Fault, a major strike-slip fault developed in granitic rocks in Korea, has a wider (\u223c24-m-thick) fault core with several gouge layers. Here we conduct detailed field and microanalytical investigations on the fault core of the Geumwang Fault. Results showed that some of the gouges are primary gouges in which seismic slip was localized as the principal slip zones (PSZs), whereas others are secondary gouges that formed by the injection of fluidized gouge material into fractures. Within the PSZs, the presence of amorphous carbon and graphite implies that frictional heat generated by coseismic slip triggered siderite decomposition. It was likely the consequence of gouge fluidization induced by thermal pressurization under fluid drained conditions. In addition, the gouge fluidization seems to neutralize the foliation of the PSZ. This process, together with weakening of the damage zone by long-term alteration, may facilitate subsequent seismic slip occurred along foliated breccia or the fault core boundary rather than the former neutralized PSZs, thereby widening the Geumwang Fault. We propose that coseismic fluidization of PSZ by thermal pressurization can act as a potential mechanism to widen the fault core and generate multiple gouge layers in crystalline rocks.\n               ","9":"\n                  Coupling of deformation and magmatism has been widely reported in several old orogenic belts, particularly along faults and shear zones. The syn-kinematic plutons in exhumed shear zones offer the best opportunity to understand the complex relationship between magmatism and regional deformation. The present paper investigates the geometry and internal structure of granite plutons emplaced in thrust faults and shear zones, and structural control on their emplacement mechanism. Abu Ziran pluton is an example of the intrusions emplaced in an active brittle-ductile thrust shear zone in the Nubian shield, and documents clear evidence on the interaction between magmatism and deformation during melt ascent and emplacement. Results from detailed geological mapping, remote sensing and structural analysis of the pluton permitted the constraining of the pluton's geometry, emplacement mechanism, and spatio-temporal evolution. Structural analysis indicates that pluton emplacement was syn-to-late-tectonic. The brittle-ductile fabrics in the wall rock are consistent with a sub-horizontal thrust shear zone with a top-to-NW shear sense. The activity of the shear zone was accompanied by an episode of a calc-alkaline magmatic pulse. Granitic magma ascended upward via non-exposed feeder dykes, or through ramps and flats in the thrust system and emplaced laterally along the shear zone, forming complex sub-horizontal sheet-shaped intrusion. The geometry and extent of pluton emphasize that inherited heterogeneities and regional stress states played important role in the emplacement processes. In addition, localization of pluton along or near the contact between ophiolitic nappes and mylonitic metasediments suggests that the rheological boundaries act as barriers that impede the rise of ascending magma, causing magma arrest and trigger lateral spreading and emplacement. The outcomes of this study allowed the reconstruction of the geometry and internal structure of Abu Ziran pluton and grasping its evolution in space and time.\n               ","10":"\n                  Despite over three-decades of active research and wide debate in the published literature, the mechanisms that govern the growth of polygonal faults are poorly understood. Here we investigate the growth of polygonal faults using a suite of geomechanical finite element forward models that couple dynamic fault propagation, sedimentation, and the mechanical compaction of unconsolidated granular sediment. We undertook a suite of numerical model simulations to explore the relationships between varying fault plane dip, residual friction of the fault, and the bulk material properties of the sedimentary sequence hosting the polygonal fault system. We find that the growth of polygonal faults within laterally-pinned sedimentary tiers can be explained by gravity-driven differential compaction and does not require additional causative elements to explain the gross pattern of strain accumulation. We also find that the magnitude of fault throw is influenced by the material properties and the original fault plane dip, but is most sensitive to the residual friction angle. Our models yield values for maximum throw versus height for the faults that fall within the range of global values compiled for polygonal faults, and throw rates are comparable to those recently measured in naturally occurring polygonal faults.\n               ","11":"\n                  When working with geological maps and cross-sections, and no kinematic criteria on fault motion are available, we usually classify the type of fault (dip-slip, strike-slip, oblique) according to the observed separation of planar markers, usually bedding. Although in many cases the separation agrees with fault slip, and therefore, the deduced type of fault is correct, these deductions can be completely wrong in certain circumstances. Amongst other parameters, the observed separation depends on the angular relationship between the cut-off line of the planar marker on the fault plane and the slip vector. In this paper, we elaborate on this relationship and present a tool to facilitate classifications of faults whose motion does not involve rotation of the fault blocks, and cut and offset previously tilted or folded surfaces. This tool consists of graphs that predict how the observed separation will be in cross sections and maps. In addition, the influence of different parameters on the magnitude of the separation in a geological section across a fault is discussed. The validity of the presented tool is demonstrated through its application to two field examples of strike-slip faults offsetting inclined layers and a fold train in the Asturian Basin. Our graphs can be used to improve geological interpretations, in a predictive way when constructing geological maps and cross-sections, and to decipher the existence of layers tilted or folded before fault development.\n               ","12":"\n                  Fractures strongly influence the permeability of geologic formations, and because most fractures in the subsurface are below the resolution of geophysical methods, predicting the spatial evolution of fracture networks is important for groundwater resources, oil and gas production, and geothermal energy. Previous researchers have established that variations in lithologic mechanical properties influence the propagation of joints and fractures in layered rocks under stable stress conditions, but few studies have addressed how instabilities in local stress fields, in conjunction with variations in rock mechanical properties, lead to fracture branching.\n                  We investigate NE-striking fractures in the footwall of the west-dipping Sevier fault in Utah, USA, where canyons expose the sub-horizontal Jurassic Navajo Sandstone. We analyzed field data, petrographic data, and unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) imagery to document the fracture network. We also used structure-from-motion (SfM) software to build a 3D virtual outcrop model, measuring 100\u00a0m high and 260\u00a0m wide, to aid our analysis of fracture network geometry, intensity, and spacing variations.\n                  Data reveal an up-section increase in fracture intensity and decrease in spacing regularity partly accommodated by upward fracture branching. We suggest that branching was initiated by a combination of changes in mechanical behavior within cross-bed sets and twist hackle propagation associated with mixed mode fracture systems. These tree-like fracture geometries may be associated with high-velocity, earthquake-related fracture propagation events. Fracture branching strongly influences permeability and should be considered by researchers investigating fracture development in subsurface systems.\n               ","13":"\n                  This study systematically characterizes normal faults in tephra rings at Weizhou and Xieyang volcanic islands in southern China. Detailed field observations, measurements and analyses indicate that these faults were likely formed during phreatomagmatic eruptions based on the following evidence: i) faults in tephra rings are closely spaced and fault cores commonly have no fault gouge, debris and secondary infill, ruling out long-term faulting mechanisms in extensional settings; ii) faults are usually accompanied by soft-sediment deformation structures, indicating most volcanic layers were in soft during faulting; iii) faulted tephra deposits are consistently thicker on the downdropped hanging-wall than on the uplifted footwall, indicating that the faults formed during the deposition of the tephra; iv) unlike late-stage strike-slip faults, which crop out in many places on the two islands, the normal faults generally occur adjacent to the volcanic craters, implying local control. Repeated phreatomagatic eruptions produced alternating and unstable ash and lapilli deposits on the tephra rings. These layers failed during the eruptions, resulting in the formation of syn-eruptive normal faults in the tephra rings.\n               ","14":"\n                  Clusters of deformation bands associated with fault damage zones modify the petrophysical properties of rocks and influence fluid migration.

We used digital outcrop models to perform a quantitative assessment of connectivity using a UAV-based system at the Melancias outcrop, Rio do Peixe Basin, Brazil. Topology determined the frequency, intensity and dimensionless intensity of deformation bands in three circular windows visually analyzed and interpreted. The geometry of the bands defines the proportion of node types, influences the distribution of I-, Y- and X-nodes, and controls the connectivity of fractures along the outcrop. Results provided by geometric and topological analyses corroborate connection per line as the more reliable connectivity indicator. Furthermore, they were crucial to defining the northeast sector as a corridor to fluid flow, whereas the other two sectors tend to be permeability barriers. We also analyzed the influence of trace lengths on the band network's overall orientation and geometric arrangement. For modeling and simulations purposes, the spatial relationships of nodes and branches help in the understand of potential hurdles to fluid migration and the variability of reservoirs and aquifers.\n               ","15":"\n                  A structural analysis of a key area along the Waterberg Thrust in northern Namibia clarifies its geometric and timing relationships to the deposition of rift-related Karoo sediments. The fault brings late Precambrian crystalline rocks up against Permo-Triassic and Lower Jurassic Karoo clastic sediments of the Waterberg Basin between two of the major regional basement-rooted lineaments that cut across northern Namibia, using those subparallel lineaments as transfer faults. Detailed mapping and kinematic analysis have been used to construct and restore several sections across the thrust that put initiation of reverse offset as a thrust in Triassic time. Thin-skinned footwall deformation created several unconformities in a footwall cutoff system. The unconformities were subsequently folded during continued motion on the fault. Various dating techniques constrain the initiation of contractional deformation to the Triassic to Jurassic (Karoo time) with episodic progression during the development of the basin, followed by major further reactivation during regional uplift related to the Atlantic margin rifting and subsequent continental breakup. This early phase is linked in time so closely to the basin development that we attribute the driver of inversion to be kinematically linked to the displacement field of Neoproterozoic basement blocks themselves. Hence, we term this relationship as \u2018syn-kinematic\u2019 to distinguish it from wholly external, superimposed driving mechanisms (\u2018allo-kinematic\u2019).\n               ","16":"\n                  Two-dimensional, plane-strain finite element numerical models produce small normal faults similar to those formed during the Oligocene to Miocene of the salt-cored St. Malo anticline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The mechanical stratigraphy used in the models was derived from well data and a rate-independent, elastic-plastic constitutive model with a non-associated flow rule was used to represent the behavior of weak, over-consolidated rocks. Motion of salt is modeled by displacing the base of the overburden from an initially flat configuration to the observed present-day geometry. Model results using dominantly vertical displacement with minor extension (2%) are consistent with observed faulting at St. Malo. Small amounts of contraction (2\u20135%) in the numerical model suppress normal faulting whereas 2% extension best reproduces the observed structural style. The normal faults develop during elastic-plastic bending and evolve from sub-vertical, plastic mode-I failure zones to dominantly inclined normal faults. Throws of normal faults produced by the numerical models range from 11\u00a0m to 123\u00a0m. By comparison, the throws observed in the crest of the St. Malo anticline range from 30\u00a0m to 300\u00a0m. Models only using vertical displacement develop normal faults with \u226450 m throws due to bending; these are below seismic resolution. Only models with \u22652% extension develop normal faults that would be detectible (i.e., throws \u226550 m). A constraint of all the models is that the top of the salt is not faulted. The maximum depth of normal faulting in the models is ca. 900 m below the top of the reservoir. The maximum throws at the top of the reservoir in the models are ca. 30\u201365\u00a0m. Initiation of the normal faults as plastic mode-I failure zones in the numerical models suggests a mechanism that could facilitate early seal breach, even without juxtaposition of stratal leak points.\n               ","17":"\n                  A new type of structural association comprising periclinal folds is present in thick-bedded calcareous mudstones and siltstones of the Early Cretaceous Hekou Group in the Lanzhou Basin, NW China. The periclinal fold system consists of meso-scale, open anticlines and synclines with fold axial trends in two perpendicular orientations (NE-SW and NW-SE) and two sets of conjugate thrust faults that form intersections in the same two orientations. Folded and faulted layers of the periclinal fold system are not sedimentary bedding surfaces but sub-parallel curviplanar foliations formed by compaction of the original strata soon after deposition. Many folded curviplanar foliations connect with the unfolded, conjugate thrust faults, indicating that faulting was active during and\/or soon after folding. The NE-SW and NW-SE-trending fold axes and fault planes indicate bilateral, subhorizontal contraction acting simultaneously during the formation of the periclinal fold system. In some cases, converging slickenlines on curviplanar foliation planes within anticline cores point to localized isotropic contraction probably caused by scaping fluids and increased hydrostatic pressure. Similarities with the better-known polygonal fault system include development in fine-grained sediments and layer boundness, whereas main differences are a dominance of contractional faults in the periclinal fold system versus extensional faults in the polygonal fault system and a higher consolidation of sediments needed for the development of the periclinal fold system. This study suggests that collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang Blocks combined with oblique convergence and subsequent collision along the southeastern margin of the Eurasian plate following compaction-related volume loss of fine-grained sediments led to the formation of the periclinal fold system in the Hekou Group in the Late Cretaceous.\n               ","18":"\n                  We analyzed from meso-to microscale the chemical interaction (e.g., bleaching) between deep fluids and carbonate rocks in pelagic limestones exposed along the seismically active Gubbio normal fault (Northern Apennines), exhumed from ca. 2\u00a0km depth. Bleaching is enhanced by the exploitation of inherited stylolitic seams by fluids and is favored by the progressive leaching and mobilization of primary components (i.e., Ca, Fe, Pb, and Cu) and the precipitation of authigenic baryte due to temperature and\/or redox potential contrast.\n                  Analysis of fluid inclusions trapped in calcite veins in the damage zone precipitated from a H2O\u2013NaCl-bearing fluid(s), with low salinity (1.22\u20132.57\u00a0wt%NaCleq) and a range of trapping temperature between 107 \u00b0C and 185 \u00b0C, higher than the host rock peak T conditions. Analysis of fluid inclusions and noble gases from syn-kinematic calcite and mineralogy of altered rocks suggests a mixed contribution between crustal-derived fluids with diagenetic fluids containing sulphates and CO2. We speculate that bleaching is a by-product of the circulation of such aggressive fluids with mixed contributions, likely mobilized during seismic event(s) and injected into the damage zone at shallow depths. Such processes, affecting the chemical-physical properties of limestones, are generally underestimated and should be considered when modelling hydraulic connectivity in fractured carbonate reservoirs.\n               ","19":"\n                  Faults in volcanic areas can have different origins and can form due to several volcano-tectonic processes.

Geometric and kinematic data indicate that the fault array consists of steeply dipping faults with both normal and reverse senses of movement. Displacement data suggest that these faults with opposed kinematics acted together , in agreement with what was previously described from analogue and numerical experiments for faults formed in response to gravitational collapses in volcanic areas. By integrating these results with considerations of the recent volcano-tectonic evolution of the Campi Flegrei caldera, we propose a model in which the studied fault array developed to accommodate a gravitational collapse triggered by an underground magma migration predating the 1538 CE historical Monte Nuovo eruption.

This study presents three sets of sandbox experiments in which topographic loading and geometry of inherited faults were first separately investigated, then explored jointly. Experiments show that smaller topographic loading favors gentle-dipping wedge front thrusts, while larger topographic loading promotes the development of steep wedge front faults. Introduced as zones of frictional weakness, all inherited faults promote deformation localization, though the steep ones are characterized by buttressing nearby rather than direct slip on themselves. When the two factors were tested integrally, four major deformation modes arose, including (1) direct reactivation; (2) fault truncation in the initial stage of compression; (3) stacking of small thrusts against the inherited fault and possible truncation in a later evolutionary stage; (4) behavior as a fossil structure. These modes show differences not only in first-order deformation styles, but also in the distribution of secondary structures, defining a basic framework and providing new guides for the interpretation of complex wedge front fault systems and their activities, in areas such as the Longmen Shan (eastern Tibet), the Tian Shan and the western margin of the Taiwan orogen.\n               ","22":"\n                  It is generally accepted that grain boundary sliding (GBS) is the dominant deformation mechanism in fine-grained strain localization zones.

In this contribution, recrystallized matrix grains in calcite marbles from the Jinzhou detachment fault zone at the middle crustal level, Liaodong Peninsula, Northeast China, show clear evidence of GBS, e.g., 1) fine grains with sizes of 5\u201330\u00a0\u03bcm, nearly equant grain shapes and slightly curved grain boundaries, 2) rare evidence for intracrystalline deformation, 3) existence of four-grain junctions and aligned straight grain boundaries, and 4) weak crystallographic preferred orientations. The existence of high misorientation zones along the margins of the matrix grains, especially at their triple junctions, and differences in cathodoluminescence (CL) characteristics between rims and cores of the grains indicate simultaneous accommodation of GBS by dislocation motion and grain boundary diffusion. The different CL characteristics between rims and cores of calcite matrix grains and the presence of calcite-filled cracks imply fluid activity during deformation. Fluids could dramatically enhance GBS by promoting dislocation motion and grain boundary diffusion. Additionally, the nucleation of fine grains by dynamic recrystallization and cavitation-sealing processes during GBS guaranteed the maintenance of GBS. At the same time, the occurrence of micropores and the existence of second phases also inhibit grain growth.

Key aspects of the structural development of the range are unresolved. In particular, it is unclear whether the fold-thrust belt developed via forward-propagating salt-cored detachment folds which locally nucleated late thrust faults, or if such detachment folds grew interspersed with either (i) long-lived pre-kinematic salt diapirs that evolved into local salt thrusts and\/or (ii) source-fed thrust faults and associated folds. Detachment folds and hanging wall anticlines of source-fed thrusts feature gradual lateral propagation during growth, whereas diapirs either lack lateral propagation or involve irregular propagation and dramatic strain gradients. Therefore, we test the hypotheses by examining potential geomorphological records of lateral ridge propagation along the frontal Kuqa fold-thrust belt. A particular focus is the Quele salt thrust, because it spans one tenth of the length of the frontal belt and it is commonly hypothesized to represent a deformed diapir or a source-fed thrust fault.

These features are consistent with lateral fold propagation. At the Quele salt thrust, such evidence indicates that the hanging wall developed as two distinct anticlines which merged into a composite anticlinorium.

Our analysis additionally implies that Cavanacaw is younger than the nearby Late Ordovician Curraghinalt deposit which is related to the Grampian event, but is also slightly older than the Early Devonian Cononish deposit in Scotland that similarly links to the Scandian event. This study ultimately demonstrates how an understanding of progressive deformation can have key scientific and economic implications by informing regional and tectonic deformation models and exploration strategies, respectively.\n               ","27":"\n                  Fault rocks in the brittle regime are often the result of large-displacement shearing. Traditional direct shear tests that perform small displacements can only study one episode of the whole faulting process. Ring shear apparatuses that can achieve large-displacement shearing are mostly used to study incohesive soil or friction granular materials. The objective of this paper is to study the brittle cataclastic process of fault rocks from the damage of intact rock to the frictional movement of the incohesive cataclastic rocks. A large-displacement direct shear model with a constant contact area of fault walls based on the particle-based discrete element method is proposed to simulate the structural evolution and mechanical behavior of dry brittle fault rocks. The results show that the crushing and rounding of irregular fragments are responsible for the reduction in the friction coefficient. The sharp fall is due to the crushing of rock fragments, while a moderate decline indicates grain rotation in the postpeak stress-displacement curve. This model helps to understand the cataclasis of brittle fault rocks.\n               ","28":"\n                  Pull-apart basins are structurally complex features that typically form in between two laterally offset strike-slip zones. The vast majority of analogue experiments on the formation of this type of basins have been conducted using basal discontinuities that transmitted from the bottom up strike-slip motion into the overlying sedimentary cover. Here, we present a series of models whose aim is to demonstrate that pull-apart basins above a viscous layer can be initiated not from the base up, but by the sole effect of lateral forces that allow two blocks to move laterally one past the other. This occurs independently from the basement, from which the brittle cover is fully decoupled by the viscous layer. This work was inspired by a natural example, the El Hamma Basin, located in Central Tunisia West of the city of Gabes and is bounded by two N100-110 trending major fault corridors, the Oum Ali- Fejij corridor in the North, and the Oglet Merteba-Matmata in the South. The area underwent multiple tectonic episodes of both extension and compression from Late Liassic to the Plio-Quaternary times. The region was subjected to regional NE-SW extension during the upper-cretaceous and major NW-SE compression during upper Miocene (Tortonian) and early quaternary (Early Pleistocene). The latter stage resulted in right-lateral strike slip along both corridors with faults forming a pull-apart basin that comprises two lateral mega-grabens separated by a central horst. Although one sub-circular diapir in the area (the El Melah diapir) crops out along the northern wrench zone, whether or not the mobile Triassic series extend farther South of it, beneath the pull-apart basin, is still debated.\n                  Through a series of analogue experiments using an innovative technique that generates two narrow, parallel strike-slip zones located within the sedimentary cover, rather than in the basement. Experimental results show remarkably similar geometry and evolution with those of the El Hamma basin. Moreover, from a regional perspective, our results suggest that the pinch out of the Triassic evaporites extends further South than previously thought and underlies at least part of the El Hamma basin.\n               ","29":"\n                  In this work we show how the model of monoclinic transpression\/transtension can be applied to obtain the relation between the kinematic vorticity number of the flow, the angle between the strikes of extension fractures and shear zone, and the extension value normal to the extension fractures. This relation is graphically shown in a diagram that can be used to estimate the kinematic vorticity number provided that the other geometric and deformational parameters can be measured. The method is checked against published analogue experiments and is applied to the cases of the Rinconada fault system (Central California) and the Torcal de Antequera massif (Spain), where it is possible to evaluate the feasibility and robustness of this procedure by comparing its predictions against the vorticity values previously obtained with independent methods.\n               ","30":"\n                  Ancient gneissic terranes are critical rare materials that can reveal the Earth's early crustal evolution.

The THF is a splay off the Tanlu fault zone and has been traced for 130\u00a0km and is 1\u20131.5\u00a0km wide. The THF has a 28\u00a0km sinistral offset, which has been established by detailed field observation. Restoring the 28\u00a0km offset, means that: (1) A sizeable potential area is recognized for searching for more 3.8\u20132.9\u00a0Ga Eo-Mesoarchean rocks; (2) A large NW-striking late Archean BIF belt is correlated with another at Anshan. Our data integrate with regional structural information of the Tanlu fault zone; we suggested that the Tanlu fault zone has an eastwards-fan splay pattern geometric feature in its northern part. Accordingly, we further restore the ancient tectonic configuration of eastern Asia before the Tanlu fault zone initiation. Eo-Mesoarchean rocks and 2.7\u20132.9\u00a0Ga terranes cropping out in Eastern Block of the North China Craton are arranged in line with NNW-SSE strike, which is consistent with their oriented gneissic foliations.\n               ","31":"\n                  Basement fracture and fault patterns on passive continental margins control the onshore landscape and offshore distribution of sediment packages and fluid pathways. In this study, we decipher the spatial-temporal evolution of brittle faults and fractures in the northern section of the passive margin of Western Norway by combining field observations of fault mineralizations and K\u2013Ar fault gouge dating with different paleostress approaches, resulting in the following model: (1) High-T fault mineralizations indicate Silurian NW-SE compression followed by NW-SE extension in the Early to Mid-Devonian. (2) Epidote, chlorite and quartz fault mineralizations indicate a dominant strike-slip stress field in the Late Devonian to early Carboniferous. (3) E-W extensional stress fields which could be related to Permo-Triassic or Late Jurassic rifting are not prominent in our data set. (4) K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages indicate two extensive faulting events under a WNW-ESE transtensional stress regime with related precipitation of zeolite and calcite in the mid (123-115\u00a0Ma) and late (86-77\u00a0Ma) Cretaceous. Our results show that the brittle architecture of the study area is dominated by reactivation of ductile precursors and newly formed strike-slip faults, which is different from the dip-slip dominated brittle architecture of the southern section of the West Norway margin.\n               ","32":"\n                  This study uses veins, striated faults, and fluid inclusions (FIs) for deciphering the tectonic stresses and the role of fluids in the evolution of the South Almora Thrust Zone (SATZ). The paleostress analysis implies that the SATZ bears a record of four different stress states. The syntectonic fluids preserved in the fluid inclusions in the quartz veins are predominantly aqueous-carbonic saline with a minor amount of methane detected in Raman spectroscopy. FIs showing the variable and uniform degrees of fill were entrapped as the immiscible and miscible aqueous-carbonic fluids, respectively. Microthermometry on FIs implies a considerable fluctuation in fluid pressure during the evolution of the SATZ. The absolute paleostress magnitude, estimated by the 3-D Mohr circle reconstruction, substantiates fluctuation in the ambient stress, indicating the role of tectonic stress. The implosion and explosion textures in fluid inclusions, fluid pressure fluctuations, and tectonic stress fluctuations are attributed to multiple seismic events that occurred at a depth of 7\u201313\u00a0km during the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene (21\u201325\u00a0Ma).\n               ","33":"\n                  The Central Iranian Micro-plate (CIM) is a dismembered piece of northern Gondwana. The aim of this study is to reconstruct the post-Early Cretaceous structural evolution of the western edge of CIM in the light of the integration of regional to the micro-scale structural data with minor Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) analyses. Our original field measurements on the structural architecture of the study area show main NW-SE and E-W structural trends that are accompanied by structural evidence for superposition. However, paleostresses obtained from fault and fold analysis (stress inversion method on faults and statistically \u03c0-plane and \u03b2-axis solution on folds), statistical Fry center-to-center analysis on the oriented thin-sections integrated with AMS results suggest that the study area has experienced a NE-SW-directed compressional regime since Paleocene time followed by a post-Early Miocene, roughly N\u2013S-directed, regional compressional regime. Furthermore, the results of this work confirm the consistency between regional-micro structural analysis and AMS analysis. The most of samples show composite (sedimentary\u00a0+\u00a0tectonic) magnetic fabric and intermediate arrangement in the orientation of the magnetic fabric. Reconciling our results with published structural and AMS data suggests the changes in the regional stress regime in the western CIM has been occurred in response to the long-term stress transition from the infant Late Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene subduction of the Neo-Tethys Ocean to the mature Cenozoic stages of the Zagros collision and the consequent Neogene tectonic reorganization in the hinterland domains of the southern Eurasian plate.\n               ","34":"\n                  The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Santa Marta) in Colombia and Nevado del Famatina (Famatina) in Argentina are two isolated peaks within the Andes of South America, having elevations of about 5,500 and 6,000\u00a0m, respectively. Both massifs are bounded by major wrench faults of opposite kinematics but comparable magnitude in their lateral displacement. Despite the volumes of research available, little has been said in the literature about the tectonics surrounding these particular systems. In this context, digital terrain elevation (DEM), regional geology, satellite imagery and geophysical data were analysed to illustrate how a network of transcurrent faults uplifted the peaks. We propose a model to account for topography by the opposed movement of faults operating in two compartments: internal (acute) and external (obtuse). Fault motion caused uplift of the internal compartments: a) the Santa Marta tectonic syntaxis is generated by the sinistral Santa Marta-Bucaramanga Fault on the west and the dextral Oca-Pilar Fault to the north whilst, b) the Famatina tectonic syntaxis is caused by the Valle F\u00e9rtil sinistral fault on the western side and the dextral Tucum\u00e1n lineament to the north. Elevation maps documenting the lateral displacement of modern alluvial fans provide evidence of the existence and kinematics of these faults. Active since the Neogene, the transcurrent faults resulted in displacements in the order of 25\u201360\u00a0km, with velocities of approximately 1\u20132\u00a0cm\/year. Seismic records suggest that the syntaxis occurred after reactivation of oblique discontinuities in the basement due to the convergence of the Nazca, Caribbean, and South American plates. This tectonic framework led to the formation of a remarkable positive relief and the development of internal positive compartments subject to constrictive forces. Simultaneously, external distensive and negative compartments controlled the syntectonic deposition of thick sedimentary sequences. The significant topographic difference between the internal positive compartments and their external negative counterparts triggered high rates of erosion, transport, and ultimately sedimentation. Regional subsurface surveys indicate strong anomalies of the underlying bedrock influenced by tectonic syntaxis.\n               ","35":"\n                  Natural beds at different stratigraphic levels display different degrees of folding. Variable propagation-to-slip ratios in the trishear models are more appropriate for the reproduction of natural folds. An improved trishear model with self-adaptive propagation-to-slip ratio, called TMSP, is proposed in this paper. Transverse isotropy elastic constitutive relationships are utilized to formulate the mechanic behaviors of the overlying sediments. The von Mises failure criterion is introduced to determine whether the material points are destroyed in TMSP. Compared with previous trishear models, TMSP has the advantage that propagation-to-slip ratio can be updated with the proceeding of fault rupture propagation and is not required to be predetermined. A natural fault-propagation fold, Tejerina fold, can be reproduced well by TMSP. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to investigate the influences of three key parameters of TMSP, including apical angle, yield stress, and elastic modulus, on faulting process and folding growth.\n               ","36":"\n                  The mechanisms by which fluids modify the mineralogy and geochemistry of fault zones and the role of rock\u2013fluid interactions in fault weakening are subjects of debate. We assessed the mineralogical and geochemical variations in fault rocks in the Shaba area of the Yingxiu\u2013Beichuan surface rupture zone of the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake using analyses of their mineralogical compositions, major elements, and the microstructural characteristics of wall rocks, damage zones, and oriented fault gouge samples from the principal slip zones. The elemental and mineralogical compositions show a certain regularity across the fault zone from the wall rocks to the fault gouge so that (1) Al2O3, Fe2O3\n                     T, and K2O contents increase and exhibit significant enrichments in the fault gouge; (2) Na2O and P2O5 contents decrease gradually and exhibit significant depletions in the fault gouge; (3) quartz, feldspar, and carbonate mineral contents decline; and (4) clay mineral contents increase dramatically. Isocon analysis indicates that mass losses in the Shaba fault zone occur with losses in the damage zone < the fault gouge. The mechanisms of material loss and transformation in the fault zone are complex, and mechanical fracturing, dehydration reactions, and fluid\u2013rock interactions are important factors in changing and controlling the material compositions and fault zone evolution, with material losses and transformation especially important within the fault core. Moreover, due to the damage zone having a higher permeability than the fault core, it was conducive to hydrothermal upwelling, fluid\u2013rock interactions, and fracture healing.\n               ","37":"\n                  Tectonic pseudotachylytes have provided valuable insights into the evolution of seismic activity during crustal deformation. However, the origin and formation processes of pseudotachylytes are still debated. Thin pseudotachylyte veins were first recognized within the granitic mylonites of the continental exhumed Ailaoshan-Red River strike-slip shear zone, southeastern Asia, which record the deformation characteristics from ductile (mylonite) to brittle deformation (ultracataclasite). Mylonitization resulted in the recrystallization of quartz aggregates\/ribbons, fine-grained plagioclase, and the concentration of biotite into biotite-rich foliation planes. The pseudotachylyte veins have various angles oblique to the host rock foliation, which record superimposition of the latter brittle deformation onto former ductile fabrics. Observations of the microstructure and quartz clast size distribution (obey power-law distribution) suggest that crushing was the dominant process in the formation of pseudotachylyte in the samples. Plagioclase within the pseudotachylyte vein presents a complex texture of high-strength nanocrystalline to partly amorphous material. Detailed microstructure observation revealed that amorphous materials form by a solid-state amorphization process and is different from friction melts. The changes in composition between plagioclase clasts and amorphous materials (enriched in Ca, but depleted in Na) provide evidence of mechanochemical effect that accompanies fault motion and comminution process. When a sufficient amount of amorphous material is formed, it has great significance in fault weakening through the coseismic slip of the strain partition.\n               ","38":"\n                  Predicting natural fracture networks is critical for unconventional hydrocarbon exploration, carbon capture\/storage, and geothermal energy projects.

Realistic geometries guide the evolutionary forward model based on kinematic algorithms derived from naturally deformed rocks, while the mechanisms and conditions dictating fracture attributes are modelled directly as a result of key geomechanical properties and underlying physical laws. Collectively this workflow aims to improve understanding of subsurface fracture distributions by representing the inferred strain history and relating this to fracture attributes; this may go some way to addressing any uncertainty regarding the deformation of key stratigraphic intervals and permit construction of more representative fracture network models.\n                  The techniques are applied to a real-world data set from the fractured hydrocarbon reservoirs of the Teapot Dome anticline in Wyoming, USA, and specifically a 2D seismic section through the culmination of the structure. The doubly-plunging, basement-cored anticline developed above a blind fault and is modelled as a fault-propagation\/trishear evolutionary forward model while tracking the state of strain.

The faults, which formed during the rift evolution, have proven to be crucial in controlling hydrocarbon accumulations and migration, not only as a pathway for fluid flow but as a factor controlling the deposition of sedimentary rocks. Thus, the topological analysis of fault networks is a key method to characterize the different fault sets, as it provides a way to describe the network arrangement of individual faults and their connectivity. In this work, the fault topology was analyzed in terms of nodes and branches for the main reservoir defined in the pre-salt section seismic units: Rift, Lower Barra Velha (Lower BVE), and Upper Barra Velha (Upper BVE). Four fault sets were characterized in these units with average orientations to NW-SE and E-W. The topology of this fault networks is characterized by single-phase rift network, featuring isolated systems with more than 50% of isolated branches and low connectivity (connections per branch being less than 0.5). The flow azimuth is NE-oriented, mostly oblique to the trend of the main faults, which suggests a low fault influence in the fluid flow. On the other hand, the paleotopographic highs developed during the Rift phase present the highest fault density and intensity, factors known to contribute to increased connectivity in reservoirs. A clear limitation of this type of study is the integration of the seismic-scale faults with high-frequency well log data, sparse but known to have great vertical resolution, and, in turn, assessing the vertical fluid flow, instead of lateral as is possible with this method. These limitations are to be known by one to apply this in other contexts.

Tectonic transport and folding post-date the Rinkian metamorphism (c. 1830\u20131800\u00a0Ma) with the first event characterized by NNE-SSW oriented compression and tectonic stacking of folded calcitic marbles (Black Angel Tectonic Unit), above slightly deformed dolomitic marbles (South Lakes Tectonic Unit). The second event caused the inversion of NE-SW trending normal faults during NW-SE oriented compression. Field observations reveal that the normal faults have a listric geometry and were inverted after c. 20\u00b0 tilting to the NE of the Maarmorilik carbonate platform. The style of tectonic inversion reflects the amount of extension accommodated along the listric faults showing rollover anticlines and extensional fault-bend-folds in the hanging wall, then inverted as thrust anticlines, back-thrusts antithetic to the normal fault or normal faults passively truncated by younger thrusts.

We use crustal-scale analogue modelling to investigate the effects of extension direction on the strain partitioning and deformation transfer during indentation. The modelling results show that extension parallel to the strike-slip margin of the indenter creates subsidence distributed in several areas which may connect to form a large sedimentary basin behind the indenter. This transtensional basin with v-shape geometry narrows gradually towards the strike-slip margin of the indenter. In contrast, models with extension perpendicular to the strike-slip margin distributes transtensional deformation away from the indenter. Our results are in good correlation with the evolution of the Carpatho-Balkanides orocline of South-Eastern Europe, where the Circum-Moesian Fault System accommodates oroclinal bending during indentation against the Moesian Platform. In this area, the modelling explains the coeval and contrasting extensional features observed along the strike-slip margin and behind the indenter (i.e. the Getic Depression and the Morava Valley Corridor), driven by the roll-back of the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slabs.\n               ","42":"\n                  Necking zones, located between the proximal and distal domains of passive margins, are characterized by important crustal thinning and the occurrence of extensional detachment faults.

The footwall of the fault consists of basement gneisses, while its hanging wall presents pre-to syn-rift deposits. A careful observation of the basement\/cover contact also reveals the presence of a strain gradient affecting the Variscan gneisses, which are progressively deformed to cataclasite and to black gouges at the top basement, and sealed by undeformed Jurassic syn-rift sandstones, the Gr\u00e8s Singuliers, which rework fault rock pebbles. Microscale observations also indicate fluid-assisted deformation, characterized by the total breakdown of feldspars and the coeval formation of white mica, leading to strain softening along the fault plane. The overall observations point toward a rift-related detachment fault responsible for the exhumation of the internal Mont-Blanc basement, an interpretation which challenges previous models of crustal exhumation in the External massifs of the Alps. Finally, the preservation of an undeformed syn-rift sedimentary cover sealing a tectonized top basement makes this area a fossil analogue for detachment faults in necking domains. It demonstrates that preservation of pre-Alpine, rift related structures is possible even in highly deformed areas, and emphasizes the role played by pre-Alpine inheritance on the building of the Alpine Mountain belt.\n               ","43":"\n                  The Semail Thrust in the Oman-UAE mountains is mapped along the base of the Semail Ophiolite, a 10\u201315\u00a0km thick sequence of Cenomanian oceanic crust and upper mantle emplaced from NE to SW onto the previously passive, Mid-Permian to Cenomanian continental margin of Oman.

Syndeformational dehydration of antigorite at 100\u00a0MPa and 550\u2013650\u00a0\u00b0C produces slow stick-slip, and the slip velocity and shear stress drop generally decrease with increasing temperature. At 100\u00a0MPa and 650\u00a0\u00b0C, the slip velocity and shear stress drop of slow stick-slip gradually decrease, implying a trend toward stable sliding, which might be related to a continuous increase in fluid pressure induced by the accumulation of fluid over time in the process of antigorite dehydration. Our results indicate that dehydration makes the sample weaker but more stable and does not cause embrittlement; therefore, an intermediate-depth earthquake in a subduction zone may be triggered by brittle deformation in strong peridotite surrounding dehydrating antigorite. Similar to the antigorite fault gouge previously studied, intact antigorite can also induce slow stick-slip under partial antigorite dehydration, indicating that slow earthquakes could be triggered in the mantle wedge of a hot subduction zone.\n               ","46":"\n                  Calcite is a common mineral precipitated within upper crustal fault zones and associated fractures, forming veins, mineral cements and fault coatings.

U-Pb dating can be most readily achieved using the in-situ laser ablation technique, which has led to a rapid growth area in the U-Pb dating of calcite. The ability to constrain the timing of fault slip hinges critically on the ability to confidently link calcite precipitation to fault movement and\/or spatially and temporally associated fracture opening which requires careful microstructural and petrographic documentation. We discuss the varying reliability of different fracture fill types to make these links, and demonstrate that crack-seal-slip fills associated with faults are the most suitable for unambiguously linking calcite growth to phases of fault slip. Previous applications of the U-Pb and U-Th methods to natural examples at a range of temporal and spatial scales are reviewed, in particular their implications for the timescales of faulting and for the rates of fracture-filling.

New data are provided on microstructural characteristics, crystallographic preferred orientations of calcite and quartz as well as of paleopiezometric and kinematic vorticity analyses.

D2early developed higher temperatures (c. 600\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C traced up-section within the STDS) and at low differential stress (<15\u00a0MPa). D2late occurred at lower temperatures (T\u00a0<\u00a0350\u00a0\u00b0C) and differential stress larger than 100\u00a0MPa at comparable strain rates with D2early.

Vorticity data highlight a pure shear component that can account for the up-section telescoping of the paleo-isotherms.

The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) contains numerous strike-slip faults and provides opportunities to decipher the relative movements among different components. Here, we report new data from the ENE-trending Yabrai dextral ductile shear zone in the Alxa region (NW China) of the southernmost CAOB. We performed field mapping, structural analysis, and muscovite 40Ar\/39Ar dating to constrain the geometries, kinematics and timing of the shear zone. The Yabrai shear zone crops out for more than 150\u00a0km, and the kinematic indicators from the outcrops, microstructures, and quartz c-axis fabrics suggest a consistent dextral shear motion. The microstructures and EBSD results indicate intermediate-to low-temperature deformation (\u223c300\u2013530\u00a0\u00b0C). Muscovite 40Ar\/39Ar dating from mylonitic samples yield ages of 254\u2013251\u00a0Ma, which imply that the shear zone was active in the Late Permian. The displacement of Yabrai shear zone is estimated to be ca. 30\u00a0km. An integration of spatiotemporal patterns of shear zones and regional aeromagnetic data suggests that a giant \u201cS\u2013C\u201d-type shear system occurred in the Alxa region in the Late Permian. Based on this work and previous studies, a crustal-scale strike-slip system of late Paleozoic is developed between the CAOB and the southern cratons. It formed in a transcurrent regime after the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, which was a response to the deformation of the whole CAOB in the end of late Paleozoic.\n               ","49":"\n                  A series of scaled analogue models were used to a preliminary study on the influence of the basal detachment configuration on the evolution of extensional systems, developed above an inclined basal ductile detachment. Three different basal configurations were aimed to test extension above: i) a homogeneously distributed ductile detachment; ii) two sectors with a different distribution of the ductile detachment, separated by an abrupt, transversal boundary; ii) a laterally variable width of the ductile detachment, driven by an abrupt oblique boundary. Fault activity was monitored through a series of digital elevation models obtained from the laser scanning of the models' surface. Results of the models analysis show how the geometry, the distribution, the kinematic, and the timing of faulting is strongly controlled by the geometry and orientation of the ductile-brittle interface in respect to the extension direction. Faults close to the brittle-ductile interface develop following the interface geometry, whose effect is reduced moving away from it. In addition, we observe a major number of faults which accommodates lower amount of extension and are less closely spaced above longer ductile detachments. Our results can be compared with natural case-histories along continental passive margins, where extension occurs above a dipping salt detachment, with inhomogeneous distribution (e.g., the northern Gulf of Mexico, central Brazilian margin, Angola margin).\n               ","50":"\n                  The first steps to study natural structures are data collection, their representation and their geological interpretation.

These models correspond to contractional folds and faults of Palaeozoic age, and to Mesozoic extensional structures affected by Cenozoic tectonic inversion in the form of folds and thrusts. The digital techniques and data employed are fieldwork, as well as Google Earth images, orthophotographs, stereoscopical pairs of photographs and virtual outcrop models, constructed using Structure from Motion photogrammetry based on images extracted from Google Earth or from photographs taken in the field using a tripod or unmanned aerial vehicles. The analysis of these models has provided us with geological information that would have been difficult to obtain using traditional techniques.

The preferred direction of the new branches is little affected by the elastic modulus contrast. Increasing precompression stress ratio encourages right and left lateral shear branching on the compressional side of the fault and decreases the size of activated tensile and shear zones. Under an extreme rupture speed of (0.98 of the Rayleigh wave speed): the mechanism of branching differs, for E2\/E1\u00a0<\u00a01, the three activated zones are located in the lower layer and there is only a possibility for unilateral branching on the extensional side of the fault. For E2\/E1\u00a0\u2265\u00a01, right and left lateral shear zones extend to the upper layer (compressional side), which means the possibility of bilateral shear branching on the two sides of the fault.

The results showed that the displacement required to reach the peak friction increased with the specimen size, while the shearing stiffness showed an opposite trend. A slight increasing tendency of peak friction with increasing specimen size was also observed, but it needs further testing to be assertive. The weakening behavior in the gouge layer increased at larger normal stresses leading to significant post-peak softening, which was intensified as the gouge layer size increased. Application of pre-consolidation to the gouge layer intensified the weakening behavior. The degree of non-linearity in the stress-displacement curves and rigidity of the specimens were also quantified, and a hyperbolic-type model was implemented to measure the shear stress mobilization rate based on the stress-displacement curves.

The fault SB5 evolution model was recovered using the fault pattern analyses and palaeostress reconstruction, which required factors like the width of the damage zone, maximum throw of the main fault, vertical separation, and the shear crack angle along the fault zone. The results show that: (1) Four tectonic layers in the vertical direction are identified according to the difference of structure style, divided by the top and bottom of the Cambrian salt rocks, and the top surface of the Ordovician carbonate.

We present here a multidisciplinary study of the SSZ combining fieldwork, microstructural analyses, vorticity estimates, quartz c-axis fabric analysis, quartz paleopiezometry and 40Ar\/39Ar geochronology. The SSZ evolved from epidote-amphibolite to greenschist facies and then brittle conditions during shearing.

In the Late Variscan deformation events in the Iberian Massif, several kink band structures were developed in association to the NNE-SSW sinistral strike-slip faults, which are induced by the Laurentia and Gondwana E-W dextral collision on Carboniferous times. Within two metric-scale kink bands, several 2nd order structures are generated in response to internal shortening during layering rotation. The present paper describes the internal geometry and kinematics of these type III fixed hinges kinks bands, discussing their deformation mechanisms. In order to quantify the internal shortening within kink bands, a new graphical method, using simple angular parameters, is proposed. This graphical approach applied to the studied kink bands allows their internal shortening to be quantified; it ranges between 12 and 18%. The genesis of 2nd order structures within kink bands results from the accommodation of the internal layer distortion during kink bands progressive deformation and is controlled by two main deformation processes: layer parallel shortening and layer parallel slip.\n               ","56":"\n                  The successive indentation of India into Eurasia generated the orthogonal collisional E\u2013W Himalaya\u2013Tibet and the oblique collisional N\u2013S SE Tibetan Plateau along the frontal and eastern edges of the indenter, respectively. An understanding of the complete crustal deformation history of both regions is needed to reconstruct the processes involved in this indentation. Geological mapping and structural analysis of the transitional zone between these collisional belts reveal two stages of structures with different geometries. The earlier of these stages involves structures with an unusual structural association consisting of en \u00e9chelon aligned overturned dome-and-thrust pairs within a background of open folding, most likely representing the early development of a fold-and-thrust system. The later structures consist of an association of N\u2013S-trending thrust-and-tear-faults and open folds. Combining stratigraphic data from this region with the results of previous research indicates that the earlier structures formed at 60\u221248\u00a0Ma, whereas the later structures formed between the early Miocene and ca. 5 Ma. This information combined with geological and paleomagnetic data for the region allows reconstruction of the complete crustal deformation history of the oblique collisional belt, which consists of early and late stages of crustal shortening separated by a middle stage involving the \u223c80\u00b0 clockwise rotation of the crust.

Gypsum beef veins with bed-perpendicular fibers accommodated vertical extension of 13% in the anticline, diminishing to 0% in adjacent synclines. Bed-parallel calcite veins accommodated 0\u20134% vertical extension across the structure, with no clear correspondence of vein distribution to structural position. Homogenization temperatures from two-phase fluid inclusions in calcite veins indicate trapping depths of 2.0\u20132.7\u00a0km. Source rock analysis from unoxidized organic-rich mudrock at the site shows that the rocks never reached hydrocarbon maturation conditions, therefore vein formation cannot be explained by in situ hydrocarbon expulsion. Bed-parallel veins with vertical or bed-perpendicular fibers document a thrust faulting stress regime during contractional folding near the frontal limit of Laramide deformation. Gypsum vein formation may be related to meteoric water interacting with pyrite or H2S to form sulfuric acid, dissolution of carbonate, and deposition of gypsum as an auxiliary mineral.

The Kachchh Rift Basin (KRB), situated on the western continental edge of the Indian plate, is tectonically active. The KRB is affected by the reactivation of \u223cW-striking dip-slip\/strike-slip faults. The Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF) is the largest intra-basinal fault in KRB.

A sequential evolution of colluvial wedges is explained attributed to KMF reactivation during Cenozoic.

We examine the effects of the width of the outer (VS) wedge, as well as the dip and friction along the splay fault during earthquake rupture. Our results suggest that along-strike variations in the width of the VS outer wedge along the Chile Margin may play a key role in splay fault activity in the ruptured segment of the 2010 Maule earthquake. In addition, our model fit to the published slip distribution for the 2010 Maule earthquake suggests that megasplay fault activation did not significantly impact earthquake size along the south-central Chile Margin. In contrast, our model fit to the slip distribution for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake shows that megasplay fault reactivation may have moderately affected earthquake coseismic rupture. Splay faults can slip coseismically, contributing to associated tsunamis.

That led to the development of several faults, including the K\u00f6nigsee-Lammertal-Traunsee (KLT): a sinistral fault cross-cutting the NCA with a curved path. Here, we focus on the eastern termination of the KLT, previously interpreted as two SSW-NNE and SW-NE strike-slip faults, connected by an E-W thrust with top-to-NE motion. Our structural\/petrographic data indicate that the two sectors of the KLT are linked also by an E-W strike-slip fault, between Triassic carbonates and Late Cretaceous clastics. The associated damage zone is complex and includes strike-slip duplexes and small-scale thrusts, associated to various fault rocks.

Analog models have been used to help understand the interaction and evolution of detachment folds, thrust faults, and diapirs, but few surface or subsurface datasets provide adequate three-dimensional images to test and refine the experimental results. Here we use 3D depth-migrated seismic data from the Sureste Basin, offshore SE Mexico, to map two structures, one dominated by salt-cored anticlines and one characterized by thrust faults. Associated diapirs include both pre- and syncontractional stocks and walls. We show that although analog models in the literature nicely reproduce some of the seismic geometries, there are also apparent mismatches.

Our results show that deformation bands have differences in frequency, geometry, thickness, and dip in different mechanical units. In addition, sedimentary parameters as grain size, layer thickness, stratification, cementation, and mineral composition impact the vertical propagation of deformation bands. In each layer, deformation bands frequency increases approaching a normal fault, and the dip of the deformation bands varies when passing through layers. In the studied mechanical units, deformation band density increases with increasing host rock porosity and decreasing Young's modulus.

We provide a high-resolution view of the magnetic fabrics by constructing horizontal cross-sections, from distance of <0.2\u00a0m up to \u223c20\u00a0m from the fault planes. The results indicate deformation fabrics that are controlled by the orientation-distribution of calcite coccolith in the chalk. The AMS axes indicate similar and consistent orientations at all localities, even though adjacent faults have different orientations, indicating that the strain field did not develop as a result of the slip along the faults.

The fracture networks in the metamorphosed turbidites characterized by interbedded competent metasandstone layers and relatively thin incompetent schist layers have evolved through pre-, syn-, and post-folding fracturing events. Their complexity reflects the spatiotemporal variation in the strain pattern related to early layer-parallel shortening and subsequent fault\u2013bend folding. Based on insights from detailed mapping and topological analysis of the fracture network, we conclude that strain partitioning that occurs during flexural folding results in a superposed tangential longitudinal strain expressed by fractures with a high (hydraulic) connectivity in the hinge zones. Strain partitioning is caused by flexural interlayer slip along incompetent schist layers in the fold limbs. Bed-parallel slip localization zones probably have low porosity and permeability and may act as barriers to fluid migration across beds. We suggest that heterogeneous vertical axis rotation, which occurred as the system's hanging wall slid over the footwall ramp, increased the complexity of fracture networks within the Sinon Anticline.

Based on their documentation of (1) vertical dykes in the monzogranite, (2) vertical to low-angle top-to-the-E extensional faults, and (3) later NW-striking oblique faults, they interpret the Porto Azzurro Pluton as emplaced in an extensional to transcurrent tectonic setting, extrapolating their findings to the entire Eastern Elba.\n               ","69":"\n                  We investigated the role of pre-existing basement normal faults, and ductile layers present within post-rift sequences on the final geometry and kinematics of hybrid (thick and thin-skinned) fold and thrust belts that result of tectonic inversion, using as an example the northern region of the Salar de Atacama Basin in the Central Andes. The study was developed integrating field data consisting of regional and local observations and geological mapping, and the seismic and structural interpretation of 2-D industrial seismic profiles to understand the current structure of the basin. A regional-scale balanced cross-section was constructed and restored to validate our interpretations and determine the pre-shortening tectonic configuration of the basin. Our results suggest that low angle normal faults result in favorable structures for the development of thick-skinned thrust ramps from their full tectonic inversion during the growth of fold and thrust belts. In the Salar de Atacama Basin, these structures allowed for the uplift and exhumation of large Paleozoic stratified and crystalline rock on its western section. The existence of ductile strata within post-rift sequences commonly facilitates the transition from thick to thin-skinned structural style during the progressive tectonic inversion of pre-existing half-graben structures. This mechanism allowed for the creation of prominent east-verging basement cored anticlines and doubly verging and narrow, shallow thin-skinned folds and thrusts at the northernmost part of the Salar de Atacama Basin. Pieces of evidence from the basin suggest that the initial areal extension (length) of the post-rift ductile strata exert a fundamental role in the lateral extension of thin-skinned thrusts. Finally, the existence or not of important ductile strata in the overburden stratigraphy conditions the progression of hybrid fold and thrust belts after pre-existing normal faults are reactivated.\n               ","70":"\n                  Wide variety of salt structures \u2013from typical diapirs to large allochthonous salt sheets\u2013 are recognized in the Northern Tunisian Atlas.

Structural mapping, mesoscale field observations, fault kinematic analysis, and interpretation of gravity data are used to interpret BEASS, which is currently associated with a restraining bend. The present-day NNE\u2013 trending restraining stepover is formed as a result of E-W dextral fault system. We assume that the restraining stepover is a product of the inversion of a pre-existing pull-apart basin that formed during the Cretaceous South Tethyan extension. Tectono-sedimentary relationship is used to argue for an early Cretaceous NW-SE regional extension and local transtension. During the opening of the pull-apart basin, salt movement took place in the southwestern corner of the basin which must have thinned due to its extension facilitating diapiric emplacement. Diapir growth during Aptian was followed by brief salt flow from the diapir crest towards the basin forming a salt sheet. A period of Tertiary contraction resulted in the inversion of the pull-apart basin and consequently, squeezing of BEASS.\n               ","71":"\n                  Detailed fieldwork, analyses including SEM and EBSD investigations, and dynamic inversion method are used to describe and propose a conceptual model for the formation of compactive faults related to burial in micritic lacustrine-palustrine limestones (Eocene, Pyrenean foreland basin, South of France). These faults are characterized by sinuous shape, no calcite precipitation and no macroscopic fault core evidencing their development in poorly consolidated sediments. The fault pattern is composed of two sub-synchronous systems of conjugate meter-scale faults (a normal-sense system and a strike-slip system), each one with high dihedral angle (130\u00b0) and sometimes showing continuity between faults of both sets. Their pervasive distribution, angle relative to the maximum principal stress direction, incipient shear-offset, porosity reduction, their crystallographic preferred orientation, and the \u201cridge and groove\u201d morphology of their slickenside, all argue for a hybrid compactive and shear deformation process combining disaggregation, comminution, and pressure-solution-recrystallization processes. A conceptual model using estimated stress path and theoretical yield envelope is proposed to explain their formation along the end cap part during early burial and compaction of the limestone beds. The slope to the South associated to the syn-sedimentary basin flexure is proposed to trigger their specific pattern.\n               ","72":"\n                  The Tripura Mizoram fold belt (TMFB) belongs to the widest segment of the outer wedge of Indo-Burma Wedge (IBW). The structure of the outer wedge is characterized by a series of north-south trending anticlines-and-synclines of varying tightness, which progressively decreases towards the foreland direction. To explain their development, earlier workers proposed the model of fault-related folding, assuming that crustal shortening between India and Burma occurred dominantly by brittle deformation. However, our field investigations in TMFB reveal imprints of unequivocal ductile deformation, including interference of folds. Based on new structural map coupled with outcrop-scale structures, we recognize the existence of multi-ordered folds in the Neogene sequence of TMFB. However, the complexity of folding increases toward the hinterland part of wedge. We substantiate the spatial variations of penetrative ductile structures of TMFB with laboratory experiments under oblique convergence. Model results show consistency with the existence of along-strike variations of deformation intensity in the outer wedge of IBW, which gradually increases southward with narrowing the width of the wedge. Combining our field observations and laboratory experiments with earthquake focal depth distributions around TMFB, we propose that stratigraphic horizons of the entire outer wedge are mechanically weak to have deformed dominantly by brittle faulting.\n               ","73":"\n                  The cross-cutting of Riedel fractures in brittle strike-slip shear zones creates fault blocks. Open spaces develop between the blocks as they rotate due to increased shear deformation. The present research focuses on extending open spaces vary from one shear zone to others depending on the dip direction of the sub-fractures and the structural styles of the shear zones. The relationship between the amount of shear (\u03b3) and 3D open spaces in brittle shear zones has been examined with the help of analogue modelling and statistical analysis based on the results obtained from the models. The dip direction of R-fractures within a shear zone has been shown to play a crucial role in the creation and the volume of open spaces (VOS). However, its effects differ from a simple shear to transpressive regime. In the former, the VOS was higher when the dip direction of R-fracture planes was synthetic to the shear sense. Furthermore, near-vertical R-fractures showed a tendency to form more space and vice versa. The effect of R\u2032-shear dip angle on the VOS under various shear strains was low, and its influence was restricted to situations affecting the rotation of Riedel blocks. The total positive dilatation in the transpression was higher than that under simple shear. For both deformation settings, most of the open spaces occurred along the R\u2032-fractures. The role of the statistical analysis in this study was to evaluate the predictive power of variables such as shear strain (\u03b3), angle of convergence (\u03b1), and R-fractures dip angle (\u03b8R). These parameters were obtained from the modelling and their significant efficacy of dilatation. 10% leave out cross-validation method was used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction of open spaces. Moreover, 82.5% of the random variations of the open spaces can be accurately predicted by the controlling variables: \u03b8R, \u03b8R\u2032, \u03b1, and \u03b3.\n               ","74":"\n                  Soft-sediment deformation structures associated with slumps and mass transport deposits (MTDs) are generally considered to form at the surface when unlithified sediment moves downslope under the influence of gravity. Where stratigraphic sequences contain several deformed horizons, the question arises as to whether repeated slope failure at the sediment surface has systematically built-up multiple MTDs in the stratigraphic record in a \u2018sequential failure model\u2019. Alternatively, a single failure event may concurrently create surficial and sub-surface deformed \u2018intrastratal\u2019 horizons at different stratigraphic levels in a \u2018synchronous failure model\u2019. The implications of these differing models are important as sub-surface deformation can be significantly younger than the depositional age of beds it affects thereby weakening age-depth correlations used to estimate the timing of palaeo-earthquakes. In order to investigate the potential for sub-surface deformation, we examine the late Pleistocene Lisan Formation exposed around the Dead Sea Basin that contains numerous MTDs and gravity-driven fold and thrust systems. Surficial deformation is recognised by identifying irregular erosive surfaces above MTDs that are overlain by sedimentary caps deposited out of suspension following the failure event. Such surficial deformation is also characterised by thickened sedimentary successions that create \u2018growth\u2019 sequences. Conversely, sub-surface intrastratal deformation is typified by detachment-bound folds and thrusts that are marked by repetitions of stratigraphy across the upper detachment surface, fluidised sediment that intrudes upwards into the overlying sequence, together with abrupt truncations of older faults developed in overburden above the detachment. MTDs created at the surface form relatively competent horizons when subsequently buried as they are internally disrupted and lack \u2018layer-cake\u2019 geometries, while repeated seismicity can lead to dewatering and compaction resulting in \u2018seismic strengthening\u2019. Later sub-surface deformation may therefore be focussed adjacent to earlier MTDs that influence the mechanical stratigraphy, leading to secondary failures and complications when attempting to \u2018balance\u2019 extension and contraction that may be of different ages. Sub-surface deformation is localised along discrete detachments that carry the overlying sequence downslope as relatively intact slides, affecting what appear to be \u2018undeformed\u2019 beds between individual MTDs. As sub-surface deformation does not directly correlate with sedimentary caps, the rates of movement on deeper detachments remain unconstrained and may be significantly slower than surficial deformation resulting in downslope creep of the sediment pile.\n               ","75":"\n                  The Ambr\u00f3sia Sul Zn-(Pb) sulfide deposit is located in the southern section of the Vazante Group, which is the border area between the Bras\u00edlia belt and the southwestern edge of the S\u00e3o Francisco craton. This region is characterized by a typical karst environment in a tropical climate that is commonly represented by the intense development of thick and uneven soil cover, which hinders structural geologic mapping. A survey with oriented core samples allowed a full structural investigation and description of structures such as faults, fractures, veins, bedding, folds, foliations, and lineations. The structural analysis suggests an extensional phase with down block in the west, during which normal faults and high-angle veins were generated, followed by a contractional phase associated with the reactivation of bedding planes, the nucleation of reverse faults and low-angle veins, and east-vergent folding. The zinc sulfide ore bodies are preferentially hosted in high-angle veins and in cataclastic rocks generated during the extension. Low-angle veins, rarely mineralized with Zn, cut the high-angle veins, suggesting that the mineralization event lasted even during the tectonic inversion phase. The regional context indicates that the Ambr\u00f3sia Sul deposit formed in the bulge region of the foreland basin and that it was affected first by an extensional phase during its nucleation and subsequently by a compressive phase with the advancement of thrusting in the Bras\u00edlia belt to the east.\n               ","76":"\n                  The amount of fault slip and timing of fault activation are two fundamental elements of quantitatively structural analysis. Currently, these two parameters are mainly determined by the geometry of fault-related folds and the growth strata over the fault ramp. In this study, we propose a new type of growth strata that directly constrain both the amount of fault slip and the timing of fault activity at the fault flat based on interpretations of seismic reflection profiles and related numerical modeling of the Manan Structure along the southern Tarim Basin. The seismic sections show a rootless synform beyond the north limb of the Manan Anticline with the hinge dipping toward north. Numerical modeling suggests that this synform is a result of northward migration of the growth strata along with the slip of the underlying detachment thrust with a bulge at the fault surface. We define this type of growth strata \u2018migrating growth strata (MGS)\u2019. The dipping direction of the hinge of the synform marks the slip direction, the projecting distance of the hinge on the fault surface measures the slip amount, and the timing of the MGS represent the timing of the activity of the underlying detachment thrust. Analyses of the Manan MGS along the southern Tarim Basin suggest \u223c13\u201322\u00a0km of northward fault slip passed by the Manan Structure along the basal Cenozoic detachment and was finally absorbed by the Mazatagh Belt, which confirms a \u223c230-km-long detachment thrust along the southern Tarim Basin and provide key evidence to establish a kinematic linkage between the Hotan and Mazatagh Belts. Two-segment style of the hinge of the synform indicates that the Manan Structure has undergone two-stage evolution related to the lower Cambrian and the basal Cenozoic detachments, respectively. These results imply that detachments in difference depths and their sequential activities are key in transmitting strain from the Tibetan Plateau into the Eurasian continental interiors.\n               ","77":"\n                  A digital outcrop example and associated structural analysis of highly deformed sedimentary strata from the Zagros Belt of Iran is presented.

Digital data extraction techniques are used to constrain structural interpretations and cross section orientation, as well as kinematic restorations of interpreted structures. Structural analysis protocols provided here are well-suited to learning outcomes associated with digital cross section construction, interpretation and restoration.

We analyzed the geometry, kinematics, and overprinting relationships of structures in the central Badu complex, and dated the structural evolution via geo-thermochronology. We identified deformation episodes D1 to D4: D1 features rootless, tight-isoclinal folds (F1), and an initially likely gentle-dipping foliation (S1) with unclear kinematics, with the majority of structures modified\/erased by later deformations; D2 comprises a gentle-dipping foliation (S2), and a \u223cN-trending lineation (L2), with dominant top-to-the-south shear subparallel or slightly oblique to the strike of the regional Triassic orogen; D3 includes open to tight, upright folds with subhorizontal axes reflecting orogen-normal, \u223cE-W shortening; D4 features\u00a0\u223c\u00a0N-trending reverse faults.

The high-pressure metamorphism, the orogen-subparallel shearing, and the orogen-normal shortening suggest localized (oblique) underthrusting of the Coastal terrane beneath the Wuyishan terrane during the Triassic intraplate orogeny within South China.\n               ","79":"\n                  The Chachil depocenter is located in the Andean foreland, at \u223c39\u00b0S. Its origin relates to the syn-rift phase of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, a large marine embayment developed along the southwestern margin of Gondwana (30\u201340\u00b0S). In this contribution, we characterize the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic extensional architecture of the Chachil depocenter, based on kinematic data from outcrop-scale normal faults, and a tectonostratigraphic analysis of the syn-rift succession. Our results indicate that the extension and mechanical subsidence were controlled by two major NNW-striking normal faults of opposite polarity, while two NE to ENE-striking faults limited the depocenter to the north and south. Second-order NNW-striking normal faults in the inner sector of the depocenter are related to minor changes in the syn-rift deposits thicknesses. Kinematic data from fourth-order normal faults allow us to characterize the Chachil depocenter as an orthogonal NNW-trending rift developed under ENE extension. These results suggest that the architecture of the rift is related to the reactivation of Paleozoic discrete basement anisotropies. We argue that the local ENE extension in the southwestern area of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin results from the refraction of the NNE to NE-oriented regional extension obtained for the basin further north.

The Eastern Belt of the Franciscan Complex in northern California is part of an exhumed accretionary complex deformed and metamorphosed under high P\/T ratio conditions. Its lack of a retrogressive overprint makes it an ideal location to examine the mechanics of accretion within a fossil subduction zone. Blueschist-facies metasediments were deformed by a combination of dislocation and pressure-solution creep. EBSD analysis of dynamically recrystallized quartz across both the upper and lower boundaries of an accreted packet of metasediments indicates shear stresses of 32.8\u201346.6\u00a0MPa along the bounding faults and \u223c26\u00a0MPa within the main body of the accreted packet.\n                  A novel method of determining minimum strain due to pressure solution yields finite stretches of \u223c1.6\u20131.9 and corresponds to strain rates generally on the order of 10\u221214 s\u22121 over the 2\u20136 m.y. period of deformation. A maximum strain rate on the order of 10\u221213 s\u22121 was calculated based on plate convergence rate and shear zone width. These independently determined strain rates are shown to be best predicted by a thin film pressure solution flow law. Deformation mechanism maps show that pressure solution and dislocation creep operated with similar strain rates, and that progressive differentiation then increased the favorability and domination of dislocation creep.\n                  Dilational microcracking associated with pressure solution produced opening increments in crenulation arcs of \u223c 1\u00a0mm. These events have the potential to produce microseismic events with an effective seismic moment comparable to that of low-frequency earthquakes.

It combines petrography, trace element mapping by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-TOFMS) and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) analysis of representative microstructures. The fault core was reactivated by brittle deformation episodes assisted by hydrothermal fluid batches with distinct trace element signatures. LA-ICP-TOFMS element distribution maps and EBSD on sulphides reveal local, syn-deformational intragrain enrichment of primary and secondary elements (i.e., As, Co, Cu, Ag, Sn, Sb, Pb, Se, In, Te). Trace element enrichments occur by a combination of microscale plastic distortions and microfracturing at the reaction fronts. Fluid ingress along microcracks enhanced chemical replacement of pyrite that combined with element diffusion along dislocations and tilt boundaries controlled trace element mobility in sulphides at the small scale. At the scale of the vein system, the competence contrast between inclusions of soft sulphides in the harder host quartz may have favored local fracture nucleation and fluid flow.\n               ","82":"\n                  Structural geologists have extensively studied fault-related folds because of their diversity, economic significance, and relationship to seismicity.

Series A, B, C, D, and E examine the effect of ramp dip, listric ramp, concave ramp, oblique ramp, and friction coefficient on FPFs. The results of the models show that 1) although the fold amplitude depends on the slip and dip of the fault, increasing them does not always increase the amplitude, 2) The slip and amplitude gradients become larger in the case of listric faults compared to angular faults of similar dip, 3) The amplitude uplift contours for series A, B, and E are parallel to each other, hence these series produce inclined folds while for series C and D these contours are not parallel, so these series create double-plunging and plunging folds, respectively, 4) The influence of variation in along-strike (Series C and D) and parameters that affect the entire FPFs (Series E) on the structural evolution of the FPFs are greater than variation in the cross-section (Series A and B) so that the concave ramps (Series C) and variation in frictions (Series E) change the folding styles.

We add varying numbers of diffuse, randomly-placed weaknesses to examine the influence of diffuse damage on fracture network localization. The number of weaknesses controls the localization behavior of the fault network and the final fault geometry. We quantify localization using the Gini coefficient of the fracture volume, which measures the nonuniformity in a population. Each model generally increases in localization toward failure. However, models with more diffuse damage experience delocalization phases that are superimposed on the overall trend of increasing localization. The observed link between delocalization and host rock damage may help explain the varying localization of low magnitude seismicity in southern California. Models with more diffuse damage produce more complex fault geometries comprised of several parallel strands of wing cracks. The propagation of these wing cracks reduces the shear stress acting on the model boundaries, indicating that this fracture development increases the mechanical efficiency of the system.\n               ","84":"\n                  The Lamas de Olo pluton is a post-tectonic Variscan pluton located in northern Portugal.

Two magnetic fabric techniques, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility and anisotropy of anhysteretic remanent magnetization, were used to test the coaxiality of magnetite and biotite fabrics. Comparing both magnetic tensors, the fabric of magnetite and paramagnetic minerals was found to be coaxial. The magmas ascended passively through opening fractures and were controlled by the intersection of ENE-WSW, NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW fault systems. The gravimetric study shows that the Lamas de Olo is an asymmetric, wedge-shaped pluton with a thickness of ca. 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0km. The kinematic model points to the presence of a feeder zone following an ENE-WSW direction, with two roots for Lamas de Olo and Alto dos Cabe\u00e7os granites.

Due to fault-controlled fluid circulation, fault-proximal syn-rift clastics underwent pervasive calcite cementation, whereas uncemented clastics at some distance from the fault remained highly porous and friable. Correspondingly, two distinct deformation regimes developed to accommodate continued deformation: discrete brittle fractures formed in calcite cemented rocks, whereas cataclastic deformation bands formed in uncemented deposits.\n                  We show that low-permeable deformation bands forming in highly porous rocks were associated with localized host rock alteration, and chemical reduction of porosity along bands. In rocks with cementation-induced low porosity, brittle fractures created new pathways for fluids, but were subsequently filled with calcite. Occasionally, veins comprise multiple generations of microcrystalline calcite, likely precipitated from rapidly super-saturated fluids injected into the fractures. This suggests cemented deposits sealed uncemented compartments, where fluid overpressure developed.

However, there is an important variant that does not fit with the traditional pull-apart basins. This study presents this type of pull-apart basin called composite pull-apart basin formed in a strike-slip system consisting of multiple master fault segments. A set of two-dimensional discontinuum based, scaled, elastic models in upper crust are built to provide insights on composite pull-apart basin evolution. Three representative fault segment interaction geometries are modeled, showing underlapping, neutral, and overlapping releasing steps. They produce similar composite pull-apart basins consisting of two or three en echelon rhomboidal subbasins as offset increases. However, a change of initial fault geometry from underlapping to neutral and overlapping causes the fracture pattern to be more diffuse. The underlapping model produces a composite pull-apart basin with a throughgoing fault evolving from cross-basin faults in the subbasins whereas composite pull-apart basins produced in neutral and overlapping systems have no cross-basin faults and throughgoing faults. Modeling results show that local extension in underlapping systems with both pure strike-slip and 5\u00b0 transtension is accommodated through development of R-shears, small subbasins, cross-basin faults obliquely cutting the subbasins, and throughgoing fault. The morphology and structural evolution of composite pull-apart basins are determined by factors including pre-existing master strike-slip fault geometries (underlapping, neutral, or overlapping), fault kinematics (pure strike-slip, transtension, or transpression), and strike-slip displacements corresponding to evolution stages.

Mylonites distributed to the north of the cataclasites were formed by sinistral faulting and can be divided into lower-temperature mylonite (L-T mylonite) close to the MTL and higher-temperature mylonite (H-T mylonite) distant from the MTL, where deformation temperatures were lower and higher than 400\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Structures formed by sinistral faulting are oblique to those formed by dextral faulting, indicating that the former structures are older than the latter. Structures formed by sinistral faulting underwent deformation around the brittle\u2013plastic transition. Thus, the MTL fault zone records deformation through a crustal section. Microstructural observations suggest that the differential stress just below the brittle\u2013plastic transition (L-T mylonite) was \u223c200\u00a0MPa and that this value may not change substantially in the deep crust (H-T mylonite).\n               ","88":"\n                  The Cap de Creus massif in the eastern Pyrenees is a renowned late Variscan fold-and-shear zone belt characterized by partitioning of an overall ductile strike-slip-dominated dextral transpression into coeval folding, ductile shearing and localized embrittlement. The local partitioning of deformation mode (fracture vs. ductile flow) can be related to rheologically contrasting lithologies and syntectonic infiltration of hydrothermal fluids that were likely residual fractions of earlier pegmatite intrusion. In particular, the influx of hydrothermal fluids results in cm-to m-sized damage zones of localized fractures and veins with associated hydrothermal alteration across most lithological units. Such damage zones systematically formed at a low angle to the axial surfaces of contemporaneous folds, even in cases with minimal shortening. In higher strained areas, evident by tighter folding and shearing, cataclasites developed along these same damage zones. This study provides an example of contemporaneous ductile and brittle structures, in this case resulting from localized embrittlement due to fluid flow.\n               ","89":"\n                  The pseudotachylyte of the Markagunt slide in Utah is the best example of gravity slide frictional melt. A key exposure near Panguitch provides opportunities to investigate the kinematics of frictional melts. Here we analyze the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) in eight oriented samples and show that magnetite dominates the magnetic susceptibility (97.7% in generation veins and 87.6% in injection veins) and most likely also the AMS. These rocks have magnetic susceptibility one order of magnitude greater (\u223c46,106 \u2022 10\u22126 [SI]) than their host rock (\u223c1850 \u2022 10\u22126 [SI]), which shows that magnetite must have formed during the gravity slide. The AMS of these rocks records the laminar flow kinematics of the frictional melt, with a North-South direction and a top-to-South sense of displacement consistent with regional observations. The dominantly planar symmetry of the AMS points to a flow regime dominated by pure shear, towards the end of the gravity slide movement. Our results, obtained on a landslide pseudotachylyte where the emplacement kinematics was already known, fundamentally validate the use and interpretation of AMS in other pseudotachylytes including those formed along seismogenic faults.\n               ","90":"\n                  The Southern North Sea Basin (SNS) contains the regional Zechstein megahalite, a highly deformed Upper Permian salt layer, which partly obscures the Palaeozoic basement structures. This study provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of pre-salt basement fault trends in the SNS mapped at the top Rotliegend level. We utilize a consistent fault mapping methodology with seismic attribute-based fault mapping techniques and GIS-based image tracing. The results are compared with published maps from the Southern North Sea area. Data analysis is performed on a supra-regional time-migrated 3D seismic dataset located offshore Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Statistical directional analysis of fault trends in the study area confirms the published dominant NW-SE basement trend and allows quantifying its contribution at approximately 51% of all fault segments. Basement fault trend distributions in individual sub-basins in the SW SNS are highly similar and show a strong NW-SE trend dominance despite different tectonic histories of those sub-basins. This may imply their joint origin prior to Caledonian accretion of the Laurussian continent. In the NE sub-basins, NE-SW, W-E and N\u2013S trends are locally important and may represent the structural inheritance of smaller pre-Caledonian terranes.\n               ","91":"\n                  Paleo-uplift is one of the main controlling factors that influence the style of deformation in salt-bearing fold-and-thrust belt (FTB). Whereas, how paleo-uplift amplitude influences salt-related deformations in FTB remains unclear. Here we designed four series of experimental models that contain a basal brittle d\u00e9collement and a shallow ductile d\u00e9collement. Our studies show that the presence of paleo-uplift in the ductile d\u00e9collement has a profound impact on deformation propagation in the supra-salt overburden during the contraction, which localizes shortening strain in the proximal and central parts of the models and deters rapid deformation propagation towards the distal part. As the amplitude of the paleo-uplift increases, its influence on deformation propagation becomes stronger, resulting in out-of-sequence deformation towards the hinterland. The increase of paleo-uplift amplitude also controls the distribution and migration of rock salt during the contraction. Particularly, when the paleo-uplift height equals or exceeds the thickness of salt layer, the position of salt pinch-out or welding point localizes shortening strain and thereby initiates folding and thrusting deformation over the salt-base high. This process leads to salt fed into the fold and fault belt over the paleo-high and the uplift of the supra-salt layers. Our modeling results are highly comparable with natural examples of Kuqa FTB and provide insights to the salt-influenced deformations in the Qiulitage structural belt.\n               ","92":"\n                  Faults and fractures are important fluid pathways in subsurface energy reservoirs. Especially in geothermal energy production, hydrocarbon production, and energy storage in the subsurface, fractures can enhance reservoir quality and production or storage potential. However, mineral precipitations often reduce available fracture apertures, and thus fracture porosity and permeability. Hydrothermal experimental setups, natural samples, and numerical simulations have been studied to great extent. In fractured sandstones, the main focus has been on only some controlling factors, e.g. fracture opening rate and the orientation of crystallographic axes in substrates. Furthermore, substrates have mostly been fairly homogeneous or sediment textures have not been explicitly considered. Here, fracture sealing experiments are performed on a homogeneous, massive marine sandstone and heterogeneous, laminated fluvial sandstone. Hydrothermal flow-through experiments are performed at 421\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C and 30.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0MPa for 72\u00a0h to compare resulting precipitated quartz cement textures on fracture surfaces on natural sandstones. Results indicate a strong impact of grain size variations associated with lamination on observed syntaxial quartz crystal dimensions on fracture surfaces. In layers of finer grain sizes, smaller cement overgrowths develop, as opposed to coarser grained laminae in the same sample. In homogeneous sandstones, the overgrowths appear more uniform, apart from the differences induced by varying c-axis orientations. Some open fracture porosity may be preserved in areas of finer grained laminae, as opposed to coarser grained laminae. Additionally, the potential to stabilize fractures by cement growth spanning the aperture could preserve fracture porosity and permeability in generally unfavorable stress regimes. Furthermore, the relative abundance of suitable syntaxial precipitation sites and additional mineral dissolution as a function of varying detrital compositions appears to influence the mineralogy of the precipitate. If samples are rich in quartz grains, the largest quantity of precipitate will be quartz, due to the large supersaturation in the input solution. If samples contain less quartz by volume, the same solution additionally precipitates phyllosilicates, implying that some structural-diagenetic mineral phases are a function of heterogeneity of the host rock, rather than a result of variable external fluid compositions entering the formation. The phyllosilicates additionally act as nucleation discontinuities, reducing the size of surfaces available for syntaxial precipitation of quartz. Results may be applicable in fractured sandstone lithologies, which have been in the focus of energy storage and production.\n               ","93":"\n                  This paper presents a new approach based on Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility, that aims to define the spatial evolution of deformation in shales through the analysis of non-oriented fragments. This technique facilitates and speeds up sampling and measurements, and consequently, hundreds of samples can be analyzed in a few weeks of work. The proposed procedure is here applied to a high-resolution study of deformation in the Eocene shales of the South Pyrenean basin. This study shows that it is possible to accurately measure small irregularly shaped fragments of a few grams. Scalar data that are not dependent on the orientation of the sample are studied. The magnetic fabrics indicate a deformation gradient in the foot-wall of a major thrust, for which a five-stage development is proposed. On the other hand, gradient heterogeneities reveal non-previously detected tectonic features, such as blind thrusts. This technique can be applied both to surface geology and cuttings from boreholes, and its sound results indicate that the study of the magnetic fabric is particularly sensitive and accurate for understanding the process and state of deformation in shales.\n               ","94":"\n                  Stepovers in strike-slip fault systems play important roles in controlling the propagation of earthquake ruptures, depending partially on the competition between the stepover width and the coseismic slip gradient approaching the step. The 1920 Mw 7.9 Haiyuan earthquake is the most recent major earthquake that has occurred along the Haiyuan fault. The earthquake rupture broke through multiple stepovers along the fault and finally ended at the 4\u00a0km-wide Jingtai pull-apart basin (releasing stepover) at the western end. To understand the process of this termination of the Haiyuan earthquake rupture, we conducted detailed mapping of the surface rupture geometry, coseismic slip measurement and slip gradient calculation in the vicinity of the endpoint based on the 0.2\u00a0m-resolution SfM-derived DEM along the 20\u00a0km section east of the Jingtai pull-apart basin. Combining coseismic slip measurements from this study and published slip data from fieldwork in the 1980s, we calculated slip gradients of 84\u2013160\u00a0cm\/km as the rupture approached the Jingtai releasing stepover. These values are high for the 4\u00a0km-wide Jingtai releasing stepover compared to those from a dataset of worldwide historical earthquakes compiled by Elliott et al. (2009). The high values imply that the rupture could have a relatively high likelihood of breaching through the Jingtai releasing stepover. Alternatively, the slip gradient may be overestimated. Detailed mapping and field investigation, however, show that the rupture may extend ~1.86\u00a0km farther west of the end location indicated in previous studies. We acquired the new slip gradient with lower value of 50\u201382\u00a0cm\/km, which is still considerably high compared to dataset of Elliott et al. (2009). We speculate that the slip gradient could be larger variation along the stepover boundary to stop fault slip in different geologic setting. Another factor control slip termination is related to fault properties. Creep along the southern boundary fault of the Jingtai stepover, a velocity-strengthening region, may also have played a role in stopping the rupture at this location. Our observations further indicate that the increasing LOS velocity of InSAR data within the Jingtai stepover is probably related to fault behavior rather than a nontectonic signal of subsidence.\n               ","95":"\n                  The permeability structure of a fault zone is strongly dependent on the occurrence of meso-scale fracture patterns within the damage zone. Here, structural analyses of Virtual Outcrop Models (VOM) integrated with Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) modelling are used to constrain the relationship between meso-scale fracture patterns and the bulk permeability of a regional-scale fault zone. The Goddo Fault Zone (GFZ, B\u00f8mlo \u2013 Norway) is a long-lived extensional fault zone cutting across a granodioritic body developed during the long-lasting rifting of the North Sea. Fracture geometrical characteristics and the spatial variation of fracture intensity derived from VOM structural analysis were adopted as input for stochastic DFN models representing selected portions of the GFZ to constrain the variability of the structural permeability tensor K related to the mesoscopic fracture pattern. The intensity of fault-related fracture set(s), and the associated structural permeability computed with DFN models, likely exhibits a decreasing power-law trend within the damage zone with increasing distance from the fault cores. The orientation of the maximum K tensor component is controlled by the intersection direction of the dominant fracture sets. These results highlight the fundamental role of mesoscopic fracture patterns in controlling the bulk petrophysical properties of large fault zones.\n               ","96":"\n                  Fault zones can often display a complex internal structure associated with antithetic faults, branch and tip points, bed rotations, bed-parallel slip surfaces, and subordinate synthetic faults. We explore how these structural complexities may affect the development of fault-related fractures as displacement accumulates. We analysed in detail an incipient fault zone within well-bedded, shallow-water carbonates of the southern Apennines thrust belt (Italy). The fault zone crops out with quasi-complete exposure at a reservoir scale on an inaccessible sub-vertical cliff face, and fault and fracture mapping were carried out on a 3D virtual outcrop model of the exposure built for this study using photogrammetry. Comparing the structure of the fault zone and the density of 9444 mapped fractures allowed us to unravel their spatial relationships. Our results show that the areas of denser fractures coincide with: (i) rock volumes bounded by antithetic faults developed within the fault zone, (ii) branch points between these antithetic faults and fault zone-bounding fault segments, (iii) fault zone-bounding fault segments associated with significant displacement gradients, and (iv) relay zones between subordinate synthetic faults. These findings may aid locating sub-seismic resolution volumes of dense fracturing and associated enhanced permeability within faulted reservoirs.\n               ","97":"\n                  Clay smear is an important formation mechanism of fault lateral sealing. The Shale Gouge Ratio (SGR) is often used to quantitatively predict clay smear, but the SGR mechanism only considers the clay smear of the hanging wall, ignoring the clay smear of the footwall and the influence of the mudstone distribution. Thus, the application of SGR is not effective in certain cases. In this paper, based on a dynamic evolution model of clay smear in shallow siliciclastic rocks, the problems of SGR application are analyzed and ameliorated, and the Advanced Shale Gouge Ratio (ASGR) index for evaluating clay smears is proposed. We add two factors, the clay smear of the footwall and the mudstone distribution, to the clay smear evaluation and propose two ASGR algorithms, which differ according to whether each interior point in an individual mudstone is regarded as an independent calculation unit or all interior points are taken as a whole. The ASGR index is applied to an exploration case study of the Kendong uplift of the Bohai Bay Basin. The ASGR results of fault F1 show that, the clay smear effect of the footwall is superior to that of the hanging wall in most cases, and sometimes only the footwall plays a key role in clay smear, which illustrates the importance of the clay smear of the footwall. This study reveals the ASGR as an alternative method for the fault sealing evaluation of shallow siliciclastic rocks and can serve as a helpful reference for further research in this area.\n               ","98":"\n                  Mass transport deposits (MTDs) contain deformation structures often that are used to determine the kinematics of palaeo-mass flows and hence the orientation of the original slope or gradient upon which the mass flow developed. When integrated with stratigraphic data, the azimuth of the palaeoslope can help elucidate the depositional evolution and palaeogeography of a region. However, most studies have defined palaeoslopes from well-exposed MTDs, which raises some questions regarding the validity of establishing palaeoslope definition where MTDs are poorly exposed. We examine MTDs of the Itarar\u00e9 Group (Paran\u00e1 Basin), in southern Brazil, that are only partially exposed, but widely distributed both vertically and horizontally. Datasets and transport direction (palaeoflow) obtained from different structures, variable methods and multiple stratigraphic levels and geographic localities were statistically evaluated to verify the robustness of the methodology. This allow the orientation of local palaeoslope to be established for different time intervals, even from disconnected outcrops. Faults and folds, that are the main structures used to define palaeoslopes, display the greatest potential to accurately determine palaeoflow in the examined MTDs. The use of other structures such as asymmetric boudins, quarter structures and injectites, helped to clarify flow kinematics. The integration of palaeoflow data with palaeocurrent data from associated deposits give additional support for determining the orientation of the palaeoslope.\n               ","99":"\n                  Haiti lies along the North Caribbean plate boundary, marked by two major left-lateral strike-slip faults. A southwest-verging Trans-Haitian fold-and-thrust belt (FTB), mostly affecting tertiary carbonate platform, developed in central Haiti between the two faults, south of the Massif du Nord and the San Juan\u2013Los Pozos Fault Zone, as a result of north-south shortening. The large NW-SE antiformal Gon\u00e2ve Island and Ridge mark the southwest termination of the FTB as it encountered the Southern Peninsula and Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault Zone. We show that this collision resulted in a tightening of the deformed wedge and thrust faults rooted deeper into the crust, leading to a transition from thin-skinned to thick-skinned tectonics in the Pliocene. These short- (3\u20136\u00a0km) and long- (15\u201330\u00a0km) wavelength folding deformations are temporally distinct in the north and more concomitant in the south, where compressional thin-skinned deformation is still active. The thick-skinned shortening was mostly expressed during the Quaternary, as shown by the formation of folds and uplift of terraces between 1.7\u00a0Ma and today. This thick-skinned detachment is characterised by a stronger imprint of strike-slip component, dragging the FTB to a more E-W direction in its northwest and southeast extremities. Understanding of the fault zone geometry of the recent 2010 Haiti earthquake (M\u00a0=\u00a07.2) could be reconsidered in the light of this tectonic transition.\n               ","100":"\n                  Plutons in crustal shear zones may exploit inherited structures, interfere with strain localizing or be deformed passively. To constrain the relative timing of such tectono-magmatic relationships in natural settings is not always straight-forward. We here present sandbox-type analogue model experiments simulating magma emplacement into simple and transtensional crustal shear zones to test the diagnostic potential of pluton shape with respect to timing and setting. Observations based on surface deformation and intrusion shape exemplify the interplay between evolving and inherited tectonic structures and magma uprising. We observe markedly asymmetric intrusions in association with dikes reflecting the regional stresses, fault pattern and finite strain field. At the same time, the presence of an intrusion modifies the tectonic evolution, but only transiently, resulting in short-lived faults, reactivation and inversion. Diagnostic attributes include the pluton's aspect ratio, its orientation and amplitude as well as dike association. Accordingly, syn-tectonic intrusions show the highest pluton amplitudes, but only intermediate elongation compared to other scenarios. They are oriented parallel to Riedel shears in simple shear, respectively to the compression direction in transtension. Post-tectonic intrusions are least elongated, have medium amplitudes and exploit Riedel shears. Pre-tectonic intrusions are characterized by lowest amplitudes but the highest aspect ratios and are parallel to the finite elongation direction. Intrusions in transtensional shear zones are generally of less elongate than those in simple shear zones. Experimental results are tested against observations from natural examples validating the diagnostic potential of pluton shape for the timing and the tectonic setting of the emplacement.\n               ","101":"\n                  Most previous experiments conducted on water-saturated clay-rich gouges sheared under extreme deformation conditions (including seismic slip rates e.g., 1\u00a0m\/s, and displacements exceeding several meters) relied on gouge confinement using Polytetrafluoroethene (Teflon). Use of Teflon restricts such experiments to low normal stresses (\u22642\u00a0MPa), which represents a significant limitation in our understanding of earthquake physics and seismic hazard assessment. To understand how normal stress and fluid affect the frictional behavior and deformation processes of clay-rich slipping zones, we performed rotary shear experiments using a purpose-built sample holder on water-saturated kaolinite gouges at a slip rate of 1\u00a0m\/s and normal stresses ranging from 2 to 18\u00a0MPa. Results show that the apparent friction coefficient, \u03bc, increases up to a peak value, \u03bc\n                     \n                        p, of ~0.17\u20130.46, associated with marked gouge compaction.

In-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy show that clay aggregates within the gouge layer have a random fabric and do not experience mineral phase changes. On the basis of temperature measurements made during the experiments combined with a thermo-hydro-mechanical model, our results suggest that pore fluids within the gouge layer were mainly in liquid form during shearing. We conclude that dramatic weakening of kaolinite gouges at seismic rates under impermeable conditions is due to thermal pressurization, resulting in fluidization of the gouges. Our new experimental approach could be used to better understand earthquake physics and frictional processes of geological and civil interest.\n               ","102":"\n                  Although most models of thrusting assume that the hangingwall is actively displaced up the thrust ramp while the footwall remains passive, it has been suggested that this could be an oversimplification and the footwall may also deform. Despite this, there are relatively few detailed investigations of thrusts where the footwall is deformed, perhaps reflecting issues with space and accommodation if the footwall actively moves downwards to deeper levels. Furthermore, such studies assume that the thrust is deeply buried, otherwise the hangingwall is more likely to rise and simply uplift the surface. Using examples from gravity-driven fold and thrust systems developed in unlithified late Pleistocene sediments around the Dead Sea Basin, we investigate pristine fold and thrust geometries unaffected by later compaction and deformation to establish two end-member models of overthrust and underthrust ramp development. During overthrusting, the hangingwall is uplifted and marker beds remain at or above regional elevation, whereas the footwall of underthrust ramps is depressed and marker beds are deflected below regional. The greatest displacement generally develops low down overthrust ramps and decreases upwards, whereas larger displacements form high up underthrust ramps and reduce downwards. The reduction in displacement in overthrust ramps is marked by decreasing dips, whereas displacement increases with decreasing dips up underthrust ramps. Fault propagation folding creates hangingwall antiforms above overthrust ramps, whereas footwall synforms develop below underthrust ramps. The effect of this folding is that hangingwall sequences and cut-offs are relatively thinned (stretch <1) in overthrust ramps, while footwall sequences and cut-offs are thinned in underthrust ramps (stretch>1). Not all ramps follow these end-member geometries and mixed \u2018wedge\u2019 ramps also develop in which the hangingwall and footwall to the ramp are both deformed to varying degrees. Underthrust ramps are generally developed where failure initiates in competent units higher up the deforming sequence, and then propagates downwards towards underlying potential detachments. Downward propagation is accommodated by footwall synforms and weak beds that absorb deformation by differential vertical compaction resulting in up to 50% thinning in some cases. A consequence of underthrusting is that the crests of hangingwall structures tend to remain at the same elevation and are therefore unable to build significant topography or bathymetry on the sediment-water interface, thereby rendering critical taper models of less relevance. Significant vertical compaction may facilitate expulsion of fluids that drive further deformation and may also complicate the use of area balancing techniques during restoration of thrust systems.\n               ","103":"\n                  This study aims to decipher the spatio-temporal chronology of tectonic processes leading to ocean widening at a slow-spreading oceanic ridge axis, involving mantle and gabbro exhumation and volcanism. Structural and petrographic studies of deformed lithologies were performed on peridotites, gabbros and basalts from the Chenaillet ophiolite (Alps, France). Inversion of fault-slip data reveals N030\u00b0 and N060\u00b0 \u03c33 paleostress trends. The dominant N030\u00b0 extension, is consistent with the NNW-SSE direction of volcano feeder-dykes and ENE dipping low-angle normal faults crosscutting the mantle. The N060\u00b0 extension accords with the mantle dome structure formation to the east. Low-angle faults intersect roots of volcanoes that thus belong to their hanging walls. Hydrothermalism is contemporaneous with or postdates low-angle faulting. A feeder-dyke major virgation northwards, synchronous with eruptions, suggests a dextral transform fault consistent with a N120\u00b0 \u03c32. Oceanic expansion mechanisms are clarified. At the surface, magma eruption occurs along on-axis active high-angle normal faults, their footwalls enabling mantle exhumation. At depth, off-axis high-angle faults become low-angle faults as they spread at shallow level. With westward drift of the lithosphere, the uppermost levels of the ridge shift westward faster, such that volcanoes move to an off-axis position while their roots are cut by low-angle faults.\n               ","104":"\n                  The quickest approach to the separation of polyphase fault-slip data into single-phase subsets is perhaps the recognition in stress space of the hyperplanes, consisting of their corresponding datum vectors, whose normals are parallel to the solutions of the stress vector. However the uncertainty of the solution sign makes it impossible to distinguish the subsets with respect to the opposite real stress vectors. In order to overcome this drawback the existing hard-classification method was improved by incorporating the slip senses during the separation. A series of artificial two-phase fault-slip datasets with the measurement errors generated under the imposed stresses were taken to test the improved method. There is a high accuracy of the stress solution even when the measurement errors have a range of [-12\u00b0, 12\u00b0]. The new method is further applied to data of shear bands measured on the limbs of the NNE-trending syncline at the Shihtipin resort, east of Taiwan. Two stress estimates representing the strike-slip or compressional tectonic regimes were obtained on each limb. They indicate an anticlockwise rotation of the maximum principal stress axis from ESE\u2013WNW or SE\u2013NW to E\u2013W during the folding, probably in response to the oblique collision between the Luzon volcanic arc and the South China continent.\n               ","105":"\n                  In the Quebec Appalachians, the St-Joseph fault is a major normal fault that mostly juxtaposes metamorphic remnants of the Laurentian margin in its footwall and the adjacent oceanic domain accreted during the Ordovician Taconian orogeny in the hanging wall. It locally merges into and overprints the Baie Verte-Brompton line (BBL). The existence of late Silurian extensional deformation is well known in the Appalachians, but the associated structures, like the St-Joseph fault, and their regional distribution have not previously been precisely described and characterized. We present a detailed description of the macroscopic fabrics and extensional fault structures observed along the St-Joseph fault for hundreds of kilometers in the Quebec Appalachians. A petrographic and numerical microstructural analysis is presented as a test to quantitatively evaluate the metamorphic and structural contrasts between the footwall and hanging wall sequences, as well as the shear strain and fault offset related to the St-Joseph fault. The main movement along this SE-dipping fault is normal and characterized by brittle-ductile fabrics and fault surfaces marked in places by tectonic slices of serpentinite and\/or altered and sheared peridotite. Besides, a strong textural contrast between the rock units of its hanging wall and footwall imply a fault throw of several kilometers (4\u20138\u00a0km). The inferred timing of the maximum, normal-sense displacement activity along this structure is Late Silurian-Early Devonian and interpreted as genetically related to the sedimentation of the Gasp\u00e9 Belt and exhumation of the Laurentian margin. It is attributed to a late Salinic tectonic period of large-scale crustal extension of ca. 10 Ma lasting while the internal parts of the orogen (Maritimes and New-Brunswick) were already experiencing collision with Avalonia. The down-dip normal fault movement features are overprinted by consistent curvilinear and low-plunging slickenlines indicating that fault movement has evolved into late dextral strike-slip. This suggests that during the early Devonian, crustal extension progressively transitioned into a compressional regime due to the approaching Avalonia, which was accommodated by a transtensionnal phase with a progressive rotation of fault movement toward a dextral component.\n               ","106":"\n                  Integrated geological-geophysical methods have been used to depict the geometric characteristics and kinematic evolution of the Shunbei 5 (SB5) and adjacent Shunbei1 (SB1) strike-slip faults in the central Tarim Basin, China. Geometric evidence for strike-slip faulting includes the occurrence of positive and negative flower structures in stepover zones, oblique secondary splay faults, en echelon folds, and adjacent secondary faults. The multi-humped along-strike and along-dip displacement variations of the SB5 fault provide insights into the initial segmentation, interaction and polycyclic growth of the fault zones both in plan and section views: The SB5 fault initiated as an apparent \u201cX-type\u201d conjugate pure shear fault system in the north and a simple shear fault system in the south respectively. At depth (mainly in Cambrian to Middle Ordovician rocks), the northern and southern parts of the SB5 fault exhibit a typical dextral strike-slip architecture consisting of multiple fault segments connected via transpressional push-up or transtensional pull-apart stepovers or bends. The southern part has a linear, narrow sinistral ridge system. At shallower depths (in Upper Ordovician to Middle Devonian rocks), the lower subvertical faults propagated upwards as en echelon normal faults in the north, and as a two-phase, partitioned system consisting of boundary grabens and en echelon normal faults that dissected the early-formed border grabens in the south. With progressive deformation, the northern and southern parts of the SB5 fault reactivated and transferred into one large, sinistral fault in Upper Devonian to Permian rocks. Four major tectonic phases matching the kinematic evolutions of regional fault systems and uplifts in the study region, have also been recognized in the Middle Ordovician to Cretaceous.

However, our understanding of different fracturing mechanisms and their quantitative effect on fracture network properties remains limited, and good field examples are sparse. Here, we present a comprehensive field study from the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina, using a reservoir-scale outcrop of a sill complex emplaced in organic-rich shale, which constitutes a direct analogue of oil-producing fractured igneous reservoirs. We provide field evidence of various fracturing mechanisms affecting the fracture network, including cooling joints, bituminous dykes, hydrothermal veins, and tectonic faults. Using high-resolution digital fracture network quantification, we then tie these fracture mechanisms to spatial variations of fracture orientation, intensity and connectivity. Our results indicate that all observed fracture types are involved in hydrocarbon migration and\/or storage. Bitumen of very high thermal grade within the intrusions implies migration of hydrocarbons into the sills in a destructive high-temperature environment. Importantly, bitumen dykes and faults locally alter the fracture network, creating zones of strongly increased fracture intensity and connectivity and therefore improved reservoir properties.\n               ","108":"\n                  Pseudotachylyte are solidified melts that form from frictional heating on a fault plane during earthquakes and play an important role in the mechanism of faulting.

In this study, we performed heating experiments on faulted pseudotachylyte-bearing cataclasites recovered from the Wenchuan Earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling Project-2 (WFSD-2) to constrain the formation of temperatures and microstructural evolution of the pseudotachylytes.

Fractures and cracks occurred in the pseudotachylytes after rapid cooling, implying an increase in pore volume that allowed for fluid infiltration and subsequent alteration.

A valid and accurate structural style intepretation is therefore crucial to understand the three-dimensional geometries in the subsurface, in order to better model geofluid reservoirs and to increase success during exploration. Here, we present a multidisciplinary approach to unravel the subsurface structural styles of the Jura fold-and-thrust belt (eastern France), combining geological mapping, from regional to outcrop scale, with cross-section balancing and 2D-kinematic forward modelling. Results show that the Jura fold-and-thrust belt is characterized by mixed structural styles. Evaporite-cored folds are similar to those commonly observed in fold-and-thrust belt characterized by a thick salt-bearing basal detachment (e.g. Zagros fold-and-thrust belt), while fault-bend fold geometries and the emplacement of thrust sheets are similar to those occurring in fold-and-thrust belts characterized by multiple and thin detachment horizons within the sedimentary sequence (i.e. Canadian Rocky Mountains). In the Jura, the flow of evaporites in most cases is inhibited, as anhydrites and salt form thin layers and are mixed with mechanically stronger rocks, such as marls and dolostones. Results from this study can be used as a benchmark to compare structural styles within other fold-and-thrust belts characterized by lithological variation within the evaporite-bearing basal detachment at the regional scale and by multiple detachment layers within the sedimentary sequence.\n               ","110":"\n                  We investigate the relationships among magnetic, mylonitic and strain fabrics from the Pelling-Munsiari thrust (PT), a major shear zone in the Sikkim Himalaya, that records varying mylonitic fabrics and strain geometry along its transport direction. The fabric changes from an SL-tectonite with oblate strain ellipsoids in its main exposures, to a local, transport-parallel L-tectonite with prolate strain ellipsoids, forming a synformal klippen. Magnetic fabric is related to the PT deformation, and is affected by the local folding of the klippen. The bearings of magnetic and stretching mineral lineation vary more than the orientations of the planar fabrics. Irrespective of their strain geometry, most of the fault rocks, including SL mylonites of the structurally overlying Main Central thrust, record oblate susceptibility ellipsoids. The paramagnetic phases tracked an incremental deformation stage that froze as oblate susceptibility ellipsoid in the hinterlandmost fault rocks, and was not realigned by successive higher magnitude, constrictional strain, associated with a local, lateral ramp, followed by flattening strain in the forelandmost exposure during translation of the PT.

However, questions remain about how fault geometry, kinematics and slip rate influence the style of a rift-related half-graben and the syn-rift stratigraphy, and what enlightenment that relationship has for the hydrocarbon exploration in rifts. Using the 2D MOVE Software, this study attempts to simulate the development of a fault-bounded half-graben, with the aim of investigating the aforementioned questions. The modeling results show that, a planar, listric and ramp-flat-ramp border fault controls a tabular, wedged-shaped, and composite wedge-shaped growth package, respectively, but exceptionally, the planar fault bounds a wedge-shaped package if the fault rotates with movement. In addition, rollover structure forms when the border fault has a listric or ramp-flat-ramp shape, indicating that the fault geometry and kinematics dominate the syn-tectonic stratigraphic pattern. Besides, fault slip rate relative to sediment supply affects the scale, dip and infilling pattern of the syn-tectonic stratigraphy. In details, reduction of fault slip rate or increment of sediment supply results in: i) the extent of the syn-tectonic stratigraphy enlarging, ii) the dip angle of the syn-tectonic stratigraphy decreasing, and iii) the water depth in the related half-graben getting shallower. This study provides insights into understanding the origin of the variable styles of rift-related half-graben and syn-rift stratigraphy. Also, our modeling results have an important implication for evaluating source rock quality in rifts.

Thermal models suggest that the pulses emplaced over ~3 years, while total cooling and differentiation of the laccolith to the solidus occurred over ~21 years. From these results, a three-stage emplacement model was determined.

We investigate how these structurally distinct domains are kinematically linked by the means of a crustal-scale analogue modelling approach where a deformable crust is moved against a stable and rigid indenter. The modelling demonstrates that the geometry of the indenter is the major controlling parameter driving strain partitioning and deformation transfer from thrusting and transpression to strike-slip and transtension, whereas the rotation of the mobile plate controls the opening of triangular shaped transtensional basins. Flow of the ductile crust leads to the distribution of deformation over a wider area, facilitating strike-slip splaying into transtension\/extension behind the indenter.

In contrast, the Chang'an gold deposit comprises disseminated ores controlled by NW-trending brittle, sinistral strike-slip faults that formed under sub-horizontal NW\u2212SE-oriented compression. Reliable Ar\u2212Ar dating of two gold-related hydrothermal sericites at Daping constrain mineralization to ca. 46\u221242\u00a0Ma, whereas ca. 35 Ma gold-mineralized syenites, the inferred stress field, and published paleomagnetic evidence suggest that the Chang'an deposit formed later at ~23\u221221\u00a0Ma. These different mineralization ages, together with contrasting sulfur isotope compositions of gold-related sulfides at Daping and Chang'an, indicate that the Daping deposit formed in the northwestern part of the Ailaoshan orogen during crustal thickening before extrusion of the Jinping terrane, whereas the Chang'an deposit formed to the southeast at a late stage of terrane extrusion. From this rare window into a gold-mineralized Cenozoic orogen, it can be demonstrated that at least two periods of orogenic gold mineralization occurred at evolving stages of the geodynamic evolution of the collisional orogen.\n               ","132":"\n                  On-fault processes during earthquakes contribute to seismic rupture propagation and slip.

The ultramylonite minerals extensively preserved as clasts in the experimental pseudotachylyte are quartz, plagioclase, and sillimanite. Garnet is scarcely preserved, despite having a melting temperature similar to plagioclase, probably due to having low thermal shock resistance. This selective clast survival is identical to the one found in the natural pseudotachylytes. Based on these experimental observations and assuming non-equilibrium melting, the preservation of a mineral, as a clast, in the melt appears to be controlled by its thermal shock properties as well as by its melting temperature. Since the mechanical effects of rupture propagation in these experiments were negligible, we conclude that, for Mw\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 earthquakes, (i) frictional slip and heating of the slipping zone plus (ii) thermomechanical properties of minerals, rather than fault rupture processes, control mineral comminution and clast survival in frictional melts.\n               ","133":"\n                  Topological analysis of networks of linear features has recently gained popularity in structural geology, as it provides a robust system of fracture network characterisation with consistent terminology. This approach has mainly been applied by using discontinuous sample areas to characterise topology of a region, or geological feature (e.g. Procter and Sanderson, 2018). We apply network topology to investigate spatial variation of a natural fracture network in the damage zone of the Castle Cove Fault, Otway Basin, Victoria. The Castle Cove Fault's associated fracture network occurs in the hanging-wall Eumeralla Formation, a fine-to medium-grained volcanogenic sandstone or Early Cretaceous age. Topological characterisation of the Castle Cove Fault damage-zone identified an increase in the two-dimensional intensity of fracturing in the hanging-wall at a distance 70\u00a0m from the fault, reaching a maximum ~40\u00a0m from the fault, indicating the extent of the fault-damage zone is between 40 and 70\u00a0m from the main fault. Maximum fracture intensity values decay with a power law relationship with respect to distance from the fault plane, averaging ~0.06 adjacent to the fault, and ~0.02 within what is interpreted as the regional fracture network, 70\u00a0m\u00a0+\u00a0outboard of the fault. Fracture orientations in the damage zone are synthetic and antithetic with respect to the ~60\u00b0 dip to the NW of the of the Castle Cove Fault, with these fault-related fractures overprinting an existing regional fracture network, creating high fracture network connectivity within the fault-damage zone.

The work aims at understanding i) how discrete faults and the kinematically linked syn-fault extension fractures originate in crystalline rocks, and ii) how the resulting structural anisotropy controls the patterns of later-formed regional fractures. We recognized incipient faults with associated distinct damage zones (DZ; wall-, tip-, bend- and linking damage) indicating that faulting occurred within mesoscopically isotropic material devoid of pre-existing fabrics. Moreover, fault-induced extension fractures occur also outside the normal DZs indicating much wider DZs than that predicted by scaling laws. Extension fractures within the wide DZs are the result of linkage between sub-parallel segments of the dominantly sinistral and ~N-S trending (sub-) vertical faults. The resulting syn-fault network of N-S, NW-SE and NE-SW trending fracture sets contributed to the mechanical anisotropy that controlled the patterns of the later-formed regional fractures. Specifically, i) narrow fault reactivation damage zones caused deviations in the patterns of otherwise systematic near-orthogonal regional fractures, and ii) the NNW-SSE trending regional fractures are poorly developed in areas where either several N-S faults or sub-parallel NW-SE syn-fault extension fractures are dominant. The latter applies in particular to a large left step-over zone between sinistral faults, which we infer to provide the first-order control over the development of contrasting fracture domains.

During our study, along walls of the quarry, we measured fracture orientation on multiple 1D scanlines, sampled fracture fills and associated wall rock, and measured porosity. Our interpretation of the fracture dataset and associated mineral deposits and alteration indicates a large unmapped fault zone (displacement around 10m) we infer to cross the quarry. This fracture zone comprises a core zone (>50\u00a0m thick), which is the most highly altered-fractured zone in the quarry. In the transition zone (20\u201325m thick), some E-W faults cross and displace the arkose\/granite transition. The two major fracture sets (E-W and NNE-SSW strikes) are present in the damage zone (>100m thickness) and are typically randomly distributed, but sometimes are grouped in clusters (defined by high spacing coefficient of variation). The E-W fractures and faults are the result of local tectonic inheritance in relation to the Vill\u00e9 basin formation at the end of the Hercynian orogen. Based on rock alteration, these structures constitute good pathways for fluid, first of all for the meteoric fluid during the E-W fault zone creation associated to the Vill\u00e9 basin opening, and then for the hot brine, which clogged the system by quartz precipitation during the burial of the basin.\n               ","136":"\n                  Analog modeling of a flat-ramp-flat fault system was performed and its geometry and displacement field were compared to those of different kinematic models such as classical fault bend folding, fault parallel flow, incline-shear, curvilinear hinge, and backlimb trishear. To obtain the displacement vectors of the analog experiment, a Particle Image Velocimetry was performed. All analyzed kinematic models could explain the general configuration of the fault bend folding. However, only backlimb trishear could represent the geometry, directions of particle displacements, and relations between the displacements\u2019 vectors. We propose in this paper that the combination of different asymmetry angles and different apical angles of the backlimb trishear model for each bend in a fault bend fold could be a very versatile and general kinematic model for simulating fault bend folds. Backlimb trishear apical angle can be used to control the shape of the hinges of a fold, while the asymmetry can be used to convolve the velocity of the particles above the fault. Both apical angle and asymmetries different from zero imply thickness changes. Fault bend folds with high inclination forelimbs can be reproduced with high positive asymmetries in the anticline bends of the fault.\n               ","137":"\n                  We propose a structural evolutionary model for deformation band (DB) development via microcrack propagation and coalescence process in a normal fault zone affecting arkosic sandstones.

Two main sets of coalesced microcracks and DBs are recognized: (1) NE-SW and (2) E-W, in which the coalescence pattern of microcracks is also observed among the DBs at meso-scale. Our results suggest that the DBs develop during three deformation stages: (1) pore collapse followed by initial grain breakage and the formation of NE-SW tensile microcracks favoured by cleavage planes in feldspars. These microcracks coalesce through linking NW-SE shear microcracks to form intermediary microplanes. An intense microcracking crush the grains, enhancing the cataclastic process. The further coalescence of these intermediary microplanes with other intermediary microplanes and\/or microcracks might generate through-going microplanes inside the band, causing the formation of E-W DBs; (2) the E-W structures coalesce through NE-SW hard-linking DBs, which corresponds to the DBs clusters, generating NE-SW intermediary planes at meso-scale; (3) the NE-SW intermediary planes coalesce through an E-W hard-linking structure, which results in the DB fault zone.\n               ","138":"\n                  A constitutive law of shear zones in the brittle-plastic transition (BPT) is of great importance to understanding loading at the bottom of the seismogenic layer preceding large earthquakes.

Here, I account for the remaining 2-D strain component, inelastic extension of the shear zone, and associated stress buildup parallel to the shear zone, and investigate the steady-state behavior of a shear zone in which slip on inclined planes and bulk plastic flow coexist. Kinematic constraints and constitutive laws of the two mechanisms were solved numerically. The results show that the inclination of slip planes causes weakening relative to the friction law. Whereas the previous two-mechanism model yields a larger strength than the friction law for a rate-weakening slip element in the BPT, the present model qualitatively resolves this problem. Fault-parallel compression buildup can exceed the normal stress in the BPT and the brittle regime if the friction coefficient of the slip planes is in the range of Byerlee's law.

By analysing the geometries and structural deformation of the hanging wall units of the Niudong Fault, we defined the spatial variation and kinematical characteristics of the fault. The Niudong Fault is marked by a major listric normal fault that soles into a detachment surface at depth. Based on fault strikes and dips, we divided the Niudong Fault into three sections and seventeen zones. Geometrically, the Niudong Fault seems to be a single fault. While kinematically, it is not a single fault in the strict sense as various blocks of the fault have their own growth activities dominated by unidirectional and lateral growth. Map-view restoration of the Niudong Fault shows that the hanging wall was dominated by anticlockwise rotation; while cross-section restoration demonstrates that, the hanging wall was deformed by inclined shear.\n               ","140":"\n                  We documented the deformation in the southeastern domain of the Majella anticline (Central Apennines, Italy) to highlight timing and structural characteristics of different fracture sets affecting the outcropping Cretaceous-Miocene ramp carbonates.

Our findings suggest that deep-rooted, sub-vertical strike-slip fault zones reaching the H2S source rocks were the main vehicle for ascending acidic fluid flow. Linkage and intersection of these faults by splays in extensional stepovers and pre-orogenic normal faults permitted ascending fluids to reach multiple recharge points (feeders) near the paleo water-table. In proximity to the oxygenated groundwater, where H2SO4 was produced, lateral dissolution focused along bedding planes and zones of localized deformation (fracture clusters) characterizing the hinge of the anticline. We conclude that structural position in the anticline and large-offset, vertically extended strike-slip fault zones control the localization of efficient permeability pathways and represent first order controlling features for fluid flow in the fold-and-thrust belt.

The major goal of this research is to determine whether the rheological transition could be effectively correlated to the seismological one, so that both information can independently contribute in determining the seismogenic layer thickness and hence in constraining the maximum width of active faults affecting a region. As concerns the seismological data, only relocated events have been considered for the purpose of this paper, included either in seismic sequences associated with a mainshock, or in datasets of background seismicity. In the same areas, we carried out rheological modelling for reconstructing the local strength envelope, focusing our attention on the BDT depth. The systematic comparison at the investigated sites indicates that 90% of the relocated seismicity always occurs within the corresponding rheological transition. Moreover, for the datasets also providing magnitudes, 99% of the total seismic scalar moment is always released above the BDT depth. Such results are verified for different tectonic regimes and geological settings, both extensional, transcurrent and compressional. The achieved results confirm that the BDT depth based on accurate strength envelopes could be considered a reliable indicator for the thickness of the seismogenic layer, thus contributing to constrain the maximum widths for active faults affecting those regions. Based on these constraints, we also applied some empirical relationships to estimate the possible maximum magnitude for seismogenic sources in correspondence of the tested sites, thus potentially improving our seismic hazard assessment analyses for these areas.\n               ","142":"\n                  This paper presents a study where Fracture Induced Electromagnetic Radiation (FEMR) technique has been used to decipher the direction of recent near-surface stresses along the near surface segments of the major thrusts of the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya, India.

A major realignment of the regional surface stress was observed in specific areas of the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya which perhaps indicate enhanced localized neotectonic activities.

While several authors have interpreted its frontal flat as a synsedimentary landslide, a number of key features evince that it represents an epiglyptic thrust: (i) recumbent folds in competent Cambrian dolostones; (ii) thick damage zone with foliated fault rocks; (iii) physical continuity between the frontal flat and the main thrust ramp; (iv) transport directions towards NNE and E consistently recorded in both of them. Geometric reconstruction in cross section indicates that the syntectonic deposits of the Daroca area lie below the well-dated succession of the Aragonian stratotype (Middle Miocene).

Our study, based on measurement of 390 ground fractures, reconstructed the variability of the geometry and the changes in the rank (length and displacement) of the ground breaks, through different compound lava fields. The study evidenced that the narrow capable dextral fault zone emerges where ancient lavas crop out or are draped by a thin layer of younger lava flows. Conversely, within recent compound lava fields, consisting of multiple superimposed flow units, the main mechanical anisotropy within the near-surface layers inhibited the along-dip fault propagation. The vertical restriction of the fault propagation produced a spread ground deformation, responding to the motion along the blind main fault.

Rather than thrust accretion involving the foreland carbonate platform postulated by thin-skinned thrusting models, the observed structures record post-collisional foreland plate deformation associated with the far-field transmission of compressive stresses.

The reactivation of the NNE\u2013SSW strike-slip faults and the southern E\u2013W thrusts in the recent stages indicates a late intraplate tectonic regime, mainly following the shift of the Shmax (from N\u2013S to NNW\u2013SSE) which occurred when the convergence between the Iberian, Eurasian, and African plates changed.\n               ","152":"\n                  Active faults within the southern Apennines fold-and-thrust belt modulate the present-day upwelling of hydrothermal fluids at surface. In the Monte Alpi area, we investigated the structural and geo-morphological settings of a ~10\u00a0km2-wide area, and texture and stable isotope composition of Quaternary travertine deposits to identify the present day fault-controlled pathways of low-T hydrothermal fluids at shallow crustal depths. Results of 1:10,000 geological mapping and microstructural analyses show that the Monte Alpi travertines were deposited in a paleo-fluvial environment consisting of cascades and pool\/barrage systems, including shallow caves. Travertines precipitated from CO2-rich meteoric-derived paleo-fluids that yielded \u03b4\n                     18O compositions from \u22127.7\u2030 to \u221210.1\u2030. Values in this range overlap the \u03b4\n                     18O values of water from active hydrothermal springs in the study area. Accordingly, we assess that travertines precipitated from fluids similar to those currently emerging from low-T (~22\u00a0\u00b0C) hydrothermal springs active in the study area. In particular, the SO4 chemical signature of hydrothermal springs indicates a complex circulation implying: (1) the infiltration at depth of original meteoric fluid into the Monte Alpi carbonate massif; (2) fluid warming by the geothermal gradient, CO2 enrichment, and interaction with the local stratigraphy (Messinian sulphate-rich deposits); and (3) fluid upwelling through highly permeable fault zone compartments that correspond to fault intersections. Structural analysis and aerial photo interpretation show that sub-parallel fault scarps and landslide escarpments controlled the depositional setting of the travertines. Moreover, travertines only occur above carbonates rocks, whereas travertines are virtually absent along fault scarps and landslide escarpments in shales and metapelites. We conclude that, at fault intersections, high-permability fluid conduits localize along fault zones that sub-parallel the current \u03c3hmax of the southern Apennines. In contrast, we infer that clay smearing along fault segment that cut shales and metapelites resulted in low-permeability fault zones, which hampered fluid upwelling.\n               ","153":"\n                  The curved Tumuxiuke thrust is the northeastern boundary of the Bachu uplift in the Tarim Basin. Based on the interpretation of 2D seismic reflection sections, thick-skinned deformation along the Tumuxiuke structural belt is characterized by monoclinal fault-propagation folds that alternate with push-up structures. The localization and patterns of thick-skinned deformation were controlled by pre-existing normal faults. The forward trishear modeling process further revealed the existence of short-cut thrusts branched from pre-existing normal faults and tested their effect on folding deformation. Monoclines decapitated by low-angle short-cut thrusts coexist with anticlines decapitated by high-angle inverted faults due to the selective inversion of pre-existing normal fault segments. Furthermore, the fault propagation to fault slip ratio (P\/S) and the combined effect of multiple propagating thrusts determine the variations in the fold amplification rate and the growth-stratal architecture. The coeval activity of the western Kunlun orogen and the Tumuxiuke thrust in the Cenozoic indicates the far-field transmission of orogenic stress into the distal foreland. Under the approximately N\u2013S-directed compressive stress, inverted structures in nearly W-E-striking segments exhibit monoclinal fault-propagation folds controlled by forethrusts; for the oblique NW-SE-striking segments, the transpressional deformation was partitioned into the frontal contractional deformation zone and the backlimb strike-slip zone.\n               ","154":"\n                  Given shale's potential to serve as both a caprock for geological carbon sequestration and as the host for nuclear waste disposal, this study focuses on the structural characterization around a 1.5\u20133\u00a0m thick fault within the Opalinus Clay host rock and petrophysical characterization of both the host rock and fault core. Seven boreholes were drilled at the Mont Terri Rock laboratory in late 2018 to constrain the orientation of the so-called \u2018Main Fault\u2019 and several fracture families within the fault core using core and image logs. Contrary to typical fault models, matrix permeability and seismic velocity measurements show similarities in the host rock and within the Main Fault.

Although tectonic characteristics and geodynamic implications of normal faulting have been widely discussed, precise constraints on the fault slip rates and their spatial distribution are still scarce to date, hindering full exploration of the deformation mechanism of active rifts in the southern Tibet. In this study, we integrated the interpretations of high-resolution satellites and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-acquired images, and topography with the results of field surveys and radiocarbon dating to demonstrate the slip distribution along the Chongba Yumtso fault (CYF) bounding the northeastern sector of the Duoqing Co graben and then discussed their implications for the seismic risk and regional deformation. Since the late Pleistocene, the vertical slip rate and extension rate across the CYF are about 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 and 1.7 (+0.7\/\u22120.5) mm\/a, respectively, and the average extension rate across the Yadong-Gulu rift zone is about 2.1 (+0.5\/\u22120.6).

Some authors have suggested that inherited thrust faults may have played an important role in controlling the recent-to active extensional deformation in the area, particularly during the 2016 Central Italy seismic sequence. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an analogue modelling study that addressed the structural evolution of a composite, heterogeneous multilayer affected by polyphase deformation. The overall three-dimensional geometry resulting from the modelling consists of a flat-ramp extensional fault system, with flats being localised along the weaker stratigraphic units, and ramps locally reactivating the pre-existing thrust ramps at depth. At shallower levels, deformation can localize at newly-formed short-cut faults depending on the geometry of deeper structures. The experimental results provide further support to the hypothesis of a link between Quaternary normal faults and inherited thrust faults during the 2016 seismic sequences. Specifically, analogue modelling results suggest that the Quaternary fault pattern may be controlled by the interaction between the active stress field and the pre-existing compressional structures. This scenario bears significant implications regarding the empirical relationship between the geometry of surface faulting and the magnitude of earthquakes, with considerable repercussions on seismic risk assessment.\n               ","157":"\n                  Fewer studies have focused on subsurface deformation bands than deformation bands in outcrops. In this work, we studied the subsurface deformation bands in high-porosity sandstones from the Shulu borehole in the Bohai Bay Basin. The Shulu borehole was drilled through the Xicaogu normal fault with a displacement of 140\u00a0m, and the recovered core contains deformation bands and fractures in the damage zones. This study focused on the structural characteristics of subsurface deformation bands with burial depths between 2504.4\u00a0m and 2506.2\u00a0m. The critical porosity limit of host sandstone for the formation of deformation bands and fractures was determined. The host sandstones in the Shulu borehole are predominantly arkose. The subsurface deformation bands in the Shulu borehole are suggested to be compactional shear bands. We find that the subsurface deformation bands have identical characteristics to those in outcrops, except that they do not show strong positive reliefs. These bands are characterized by protocataclasis and cataclasis and organized into localized and conjugate networks. Compared to the host rocks, the subsurface deformation bands show porosity reductions of 7.7\u201327.7% and permeability reductions of 1\u20133 orders of magnitude. Three porosity intervals of the host-rock with different deformation styles can be identified in the Shulu borehole core: 1) host sandstone with porosities greater than 14.3%, which develop deformation bands exclusively; 2) host sandstone with porosities less than 10.8%, which develop fractures; and 3) the transition zone, where the porosities of host sandstone are 10.8\u201314.3%, and the deformation styles are characterized by both deformation bands and fractures. The critical porosity limit of host rocks in terms of the formation of deformation bands and fractures suggests that porosity is a major factor controlling the formation of fractures and deformation bands. Deformation bands and fractures have counteracting effects on the fluid flow in the transition zone.\n               ","158":"\n                  The objective of this study is to evaluate progressive variation in the state of stress at ca 2.5\u00a0Ga in Hutti region of Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC, southern India). Paleostress analysis is performed using quartz vein orientations in metavolcanic and granitoid rocks (ca 2.5\u00a0Ga) of the region. It is established that veins in the metavolcanic rocks formed during regional D3 deformation under N\u2013S compression that is related to N\u2013S directed far-field stress, which is also responsible for D3 folds with E-W striking axial planes in parts of the EDC. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility data from the granitoids yields NNW-SSE striking fabric anisotropy that developed during regional D1\/D2 deformation. Paleostress analysis using veins in the granitoids of the region yields NE-SW compression. However, the kinematics of formation of these veins is shown to be compatible with dextral simple shear along pre-existing NNW-SSE oriented fabric under N\u2013S directed D3 compression. Therefore, it is established that veins in the metavolcanic and granitiod rocks of the study area formed under the same N\u2013S directed D3 far-field stress, an interpretation that is further supported by the similar values of stress ratio obtained from 3D Mohr circle analysis of vein data from the two lithologies. Thus, the study demonstrates that there are pitfalls in direct evaluation of paleostress using only vein orientations and that understanding kinematics of vein emplacement is critical in paleostress analysis. Our data further reveal that the granitoids were subjected to faulting during the final stages of D3 due to which the veins are displaced. Paleostress analysis using fault-slip data from the granitoids yields NNE-SSW compression. This local variation of paleostress in granitoids is due to late-D3 brittle deformation during cratonization of the Dharwar Craton at ca 2.5\u00a0Ga.\n               ","159":"\n                  Microstructural investigations of mantle xenoliths from the Mt.

The rotated olivine maxima of [100] and [010] into horizontal and vertical orientations, respectively, are classified into five samples with a D-type crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) and one sample as an A-type CPO. The D-type olivine fabric can be explained by multiple slip systems of {0kl}[100] at low-temperature and high-stress conditions; therefore, both compressional and extensional regimes during subduction and rifting, respectively, could be applied in this study. With an assumption that olivine a-axes are aligned along the direction of mantle flow to form maximum S-wave splitting, the observed delay time of 0.9\u20131.3\u00a0s beneath northern Victoria Land can be partially explained by the anisotropy in the mantle peridotites. The remaining seismic anisotropy can be explained by the presence of melt pockets trapped along tectonic faults that developed perpendicular to the fast S-wave splitting direction. This study therefore demonstrates that the NE\u2013SW-trending S-wave splitting beneath northern Victoria Land, Antarctica, results from the existence of both mantle peridotites as well as melt pockets trapped along the tectonic faults.\n               ","160":"\n                  We present a forward numerical modeling approach for fault-bend folding based on a velocity description of deformation. The approach incorporates algorithms capable of modeling multiple fault bends of different geometries (e. g. fault bends not stepping up from a detachment), imbricates, and variable velocity-boundary orientations, with corresponding varying slip ratios. When modeling contraction, the approach is capable of reproducing rounded-hinges and parallel folds with localized bed thinning or thickening commonly observed in natural structures. Extensional fault-bend folds can be modeled using the same set of equations, with the minor modification that velocity boundary orientations are defined independently of the fault shape. The modeled structures conserve area, and commonly observed features of extensional fault-bend folds, such as rollover structures with growth, are produced. Thus, we present a unified inclined-shear and flexural-slip general transformation associated with displacement over bends in faults, describing the theoretical framework which we have implemented in the associated program, fbfFor. We show the utility of this kinematic approach by matching seismic reflection examples, analog models, and mechanical models of fault-bend folds to create progressive, balanced kinematic interpretations and gain further insight into the formation of these structures.\n               ","161":"\n                  The Nankalayuergun fold zone in the North Tarim Basin, NW China, provides an exceptional opportunity for documenting the structural characteristics and evolution of en echelon folds that are associated with strike-slip faults. Seismic, borehole, and gravity data show that en echelon folds are geometrically decoupled by salt structures and that the structural styles of salt-influenced anticlines have distinct characteristics due to differences in salt thicknesses. The timing and amplitude of the Cenozoic evolution of the folds occurred sequentially from NW to SE, indicating progressive deformation. In contrast to classic en echelon structures, the supra-salt folds are only located on the active sides of the multi-segment Deep Nankalayuergun Fault (DNF). The structural relief of the supra-salt folds is the sum of the detachment and sub-salt folds, indicating kinematic coupling. The supra-salt fold axes are located directly above the sub-salt monoclines, corresponding to the reactivation of the DNF. The dextral transpressional regime, pre-existing structures, and salt rock heterogeneities are major factors that form the stratified and polygenetic folds. The case and method (structural relief analysis) presented in this study highlight the influences of pre-existing structures and can be used to interpret similar structures that have undergone stratigraphically decoupled deformation.\n               ","162":"\n                  Variation in permeability along-strike of 10 faults, from differing lithofacies, host porosities and juxtaposition types, has been examined to improve our ability to understand controls on fault core development in carbonates, which in turn will help to predict the likely impact of faults on fluid flow. A large range in the permeability values has been recorded, up to 7 orders of magnitude variation in one example, created by significant fault core microstructural heterogeneity. A number of factors influence fault core development, and hence also control along-strike variation in microstructures and permeability. Juxtaposition of lithofacies is one key factor that appears to dictate the degree of heterogeneity along the fault core, where an increased microstructural heterogeneity is observed with juxtaposition of differing lithofacies, due to a variety of mechanisms active. This leads to a fault core with highly variable permeability values. Conversely, an increased microstructural homogeneity is observed in fault cores where the same or similar lithofacies are juxtaposed, with limited mechanisms active. However, a wide range in permeability has also been documented in these scenarios, but often far lower than scenarios of juxtaposition of different lithofacies: up to a maximum of 4 orders of magnitude has been recorded. However, the permeability range is usually much narrower, at around 2 orders of magnitude, with fractured outliers causing an increase to the spread of permeability values. Although the range of mechanisms active are not varied, the intensity of deformation and diagenetic processes does vary. Further, any later-stage processes such as fracturing and\/or dissolution overprints the original textures. Both factors act to increase the permeability heterogeneity of the fault core.\n               ","163":"\n                  The deformation of sheet-like igneous intrusions in multiple orientations can give detailed insights into the kinematics of ductile flow in shear zones. Using the Torrisdale Vein Complex in the northern Scottish Caledonides as a case study, we examine the relationships between folded and boudinaged pegmatitic intrusions deformed by strike-slip dominated shear. Within the shear zone, intrusions that trend clockwise of the adjacent regional foliation were commonly (75%) folded, whereas >80% of pegmatites at anticlockwise angles were asymmetrically boudinaged, giving dextral senses of shear parallel to the dominant and gently-plunging mineral lineations. Pegmatite fold trains at high angles to foliation (Sn) display the greatest % shortening, marked by steeply plunging \u2018Z\u2019 shaped folds when viewed down plunge. Pegmatites typically form Class 1C folds and were therefore more competent than their host gneisses at the time of deformation, i.e. they were not in the magmatic state. Such fold geometries are consistent with flattened parallel folds and suggest that up to 0.5 homogenous flattening was superimposed on the folds. Fold styles also indicate viscosity contrasts between the pegmatites and host gneisses of between 50 and 250\u00a0at the time of folding. Fold hinges are dispersed about an arc within the steeply-dipping foliation, suggesting a component of hinge rotation towards the mineral lineation during non-coaxial deformation. Folded pegmatites may also display boudinage on their limbs indicating that fold limbs had rotated into the extensional field during progressive deformation. Pegmatite boudin trains are typically developed <45\u00b0 anticlockwise of Sn and display the greatest % extension when trending sub-parallel to the shear zone foliation. Within such trains, individual shearband boudins are more anticlockwise than the overall train and show right-stepping relative to neighbouring bodies. More equant boudins have rotated less than elongate boudins (aspect ratios >3) and preserve the largest anticlockwise angles with the overall boudin train. Conversely, domino boudins are clockwise of overall boudin trains and have undergone clockwise rotation marked by left-stepping of adjacent boudins. Domino boudins display flanking folds which progressively open as the deformable boudin rotates towards the foliation and margins of the boudin lozenges locally become clockwise of flow. This \u2018unfolding\u2019 of deflected foliation, together with local reversals in the sense of shear around rotating boudins, is consistent with a clockwise vorticity associated with bulk dextral shear. These observations collectively indicate that bulk dextral shear with an additional component of pure shear operated across the shear zone and provides further insights into the kinematics of mid-crustal deformation.\n               ","164":"\n                  Fold duplexes transfer displacement from a lower to an upper bounding detachment system via trains of folds with broadly parallel geometries. While they have been previously recognised in orogenic systems where they are considered to be kinematically equivalent to imbricating thrust ramps, we here describe the first example from a gravity-driven fold and thrust system (FATS) developed within late-Pleistocene mass transport deposits (MTDs) that formed around the Dead Sea Basin. The recognition in this study of basal and upper detachments that bound the FATS, together with later thrust ramps that imbricate the previously folded sequence, indicates that a fold duplex model is applicable in this case. Truncation of synclinal hinges, together with trapping of duplex roof stratigraphy in synclinal fold cores indicates that initiation of buckling precedes detachments, which then propagated along the upper and lower boundaries of the FATS to create a fold duplex. Downslope-verging folds, which are bound by the detachments, are subsequently cut by thrust ramps with greatest displacement recorded where ramps branch from the basal detachment. As thrust displacement increases then ramp angles generally reduce, which allows thrusts to continue to move and accrue larger displacements. Sequential flattening of lower thrusts in overstep sequences may create apparent \u2018back-steepening\u2019 up the slope in what superficially resembles \u2018pseudo-piggyback\u2019 sequences. Flattening of thrusts is achieved through tightening, rotation and expulsion of wet sediment and fluid from the cores of footwall synclines and is a consequence of loading from overlying thrust sheets. We speculate that expelled fluids may pond directly beneath overlying detrital-rich units that act as baffles and locally increase fluid pressures thereby facilitating further movement along the upper detachment. We establish a new model, whereby the vergence of structures formed above the upper detachment depends on the relative rates of roof and FATS translation, with slower downslope translation of the roof generating upslope verging folds in a \u2018sub-active\u2019 roof, while more rapid movement of a \u2018super-active\u2019 roof creates downslope verging folds. The observation that such patterns of minor fold vergence in the roof still largely correspond with the position of folds and thrusts in the underlying FATS indicates that only limited relative translation subsequently occurred between the roof and the FATS. This suggests that displacement must have transferred upwards to new upper detachments shortly after the folds in the roof were created, thereby \u2018fixing\u2019 the spatial correlation. As older detachments are folded and \u2018lock up\u2019, displacement migrates to new upper detachments that develop along pristine \u2018easy-slip\u2019 laminations at higher stratigraphic levels, thereby thickening the deforming FATS towards the sediment free surface. The creation of these new upper detachments at higher stratigraphic levels, together with the development of local overstep imbricate sequences are the principal differences between fold duplexes observed in orogenic settings and those in surficial gravity-driven FATS.\n               ","165":"\n                  The Esla Nappe, located in the Cantabrian Zone (Variscan Orogen, NW Iberia), has an estimated 19\u00a0km displacement to the NE accommodated in a thin (<2\u20133\u00a0m) shear zone (ENSZ) at least 4\u00a0km depth. Fault-rock assemblages record different deformation processes operating in the hangingwall and footwall. While the hangingwall was largely deformed through cataclastic flow localised in a <50\u00a0cm band, hangingwall-footwall intervening ultracataclasites and footwall lithologies preserve evidence for an interplay of cataclastic flow and pressure solution. Final hydrofracturing and calcite vein precipitation has contributed to the vertical dilation of the fault rock assemblages.\n                  In the late stages of emplacement, the ENSZ was breached through intrusion fracturing and associated clastic sills and dykes injected along re-opened previous discontinuities and anisotropies. Together, they conform an interconnected network of quartz sand-rich lithosomes reaching structural heights of 20\u00a0m over the ENSZ. Injections are formed by a mixture of injected quartz grains and host-derived fragments. Dyke orientations suggest that the injection process occurred under large fluid overpressure conditions exceeding lithostatic values in the footwall. Fluid overpressure may have been caused by progressive fluid accumulation beneath a low-permeability ultracataclasite layer at the base of the nappe. Breaching through the shear zone was favoured by a change in the stress regime following the Esla Nappe emplacement.\n               ","166":"\n                  The structural deformation of the eastern Sichuan Basin, South China, is characterized by a thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt with exposed, approximately parallel narrow anticlines and wide synclines.

The stratigraphic succession is composed of competent layers separated by three main incompetent layers which act as detachments. The basal detachment, the Cambrian evaporites, played a dominant role in the deformation; the middle and top detachments accommodated the displacement during deformation. Structural styles are dominated by faulted detachment folds with the breakthroughs of the fore- and\/or backlimbs. Balanced restoration shows that the shortening between basal and top detachments is about 26\u00a0km with the shortening ratio of 12.4\u201318.6%. Integrated analyses of kinematics and balanced restoration reveal the evolution succession of kink bands, detachment folds, and faulted detachment folds.

To overcome this, we estimated the structural relief along seven transects across the belt and reconstructed deformed geometries using balanced cross-sections. The average structural relief for six transects is around 2.6\u00a0km. Iterative kinematic forward modeling along one of these transects suggests that a multi-stage evolution involving both thin- and thick-skinned deformation can explain the observed structural relief. Our preferred model shows that early detachment folds in the Mesozoic to Neogene succession were overprinted by a NE-dipping basement-rooted thrust system with a cumulative displacement of 6.5\u00a0km. Up-dip, the basement thrust bifurcates into two splay thrusts. While the structurally higher splay accommodated 4.2\u00a0km of slip and amplified frontal anticlines to form the Mountain Front Flexure, the lower and younger splay took up 2.3\u00a0km of slip, which was mainly transferred into the Triassic basal detachment of the Foothill Zone. The shortening across the NW Zagros is calculated at c. 24.8 km.

This approach is demonstrated using several public geospatial datasets within the state of Oklahoma. Explicit fault and earthquake location data were integrated using a fuzzy model of known structural complexity to train topographic, lithologic, and geophysical proxy datasets, applied to a fuzzy model to predict structural complexity, and evaluated with Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses and error classification.

Our results suggest that main shock and strongest aftershock (Mw 6.2) occurred on the NE-dipping basal thrust of a largely Palaeogene-age nappe system involving Cretaceous neritic carbonates. Ongoing propagation of this thrust system is documented by the existence of elongated ridges located 15\u00a0km offshore. Reflection seismic and bathymetry data reveal that the ridges form crests of actively growing fault-related anticlines. Slip distribution models of the strongest events imply that the basal thrust below the ridges accommodated up to 2.7\u00a0m of coseismic displacement. Ongoing shortening along the basal thrust also induced surface uplift of structurally higher thrust imbricates, evidenced by dry valleys incising onshore anticline crests. Combining all evidence, we speculate that the observed structural and geomorphic features resulted from repeated seismogenic faulting events as in 1979.\n               ","172":"\n                  Quantifying uncertainty in balancing cross-sections is an insufficiently resolved challenge. We present a new workflow to assess uncertainty of selected modeling parameters. In contrast to conventional restoration, we focus on forward modeling and mapping uncertainty in solution space. We test the approach by applying trishear as the most appropriate mechanism reproducing associated fault-fold systems. We present a new structural model of the exceptionally well exposed, thick-skinned Malarg\u00fce Anticline, located in the Malarg\u00fce Foldbelt, Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina. Several structural models of varying quality have been published by oil explorers and researchers, but lack detailed kinematic assessment.\n                  To minimize uncertainty, we systematically vary the key modeling parameters \u201cshortening\u201d and \u201cramp angle\u201d to reduce the cross-sectional area difference, the misfit, between model and observation. We find that the misfit is highly sensitive to these two parameters. The total uncertainty for a single structure w.r.t. these values rarely undercuts 7%. Apparently dependencies exist between these parameters. We recommend this method be extended to other parameter combinations and tectonic settings. Our analysis results in new shortening rates for the MA (up to 1.57\u00a0mm\/yr) and a refined genetic model, whereby the anticline was generated during Andean contraction, rather than evolving from a pre-existing structure.\n               ","173":"\n                  This review paper examines deformation adjacent to salt stocks and walls and beneath salt sheets, with a focus on passive salt rise or emplacement and structures ranging from large-scale folds and faults to small-scale folds, fractures, and shear zones. The analysis begins with a summary of the existing literature on physical and numerical modeling and empirical subsurface and outcrop data, which offer conflicting interpretations and models. The emphasis here, however, is on exposed diapirs and sheets in a variety of salt basins. These demonstrate that near-salt deformation during passive diapirism is less common and less pronounced than is typically thought. In most cases, diapir rise and sheet emplacement do not directly shear and fracture adjacent strata. Instead, salt movement leads to drape folding of a thin roof, which in turn may cause associated fracturing, just as with folding of any origin. There can be exceptions, with the most common being regional extensional, contractional, or strike-slip deformation that is coeval with or postdates diapirism. This is especially the case if the salt becomes welded and there is ongoing weld-parallel slip or if fault damage zones formed away from diapirs subsequently become juxtaposed against the salt by ongoing slip.\n               ","174":"\n                  In this article, we first review the progress in our understanding of tectonic stresses in the Earth's crust achieved in last three to four decades. We briefly review the literature on roughly four groups of studies; (1) World's Stress Map project (WSM), (2) fault-slip data and paleostress analyses, (3) Coulomb stress transfer, and (4) theories of the generalized continua with emphasis on the Cosserat continuum. Based on these studies, we develop a new numerical algorithm to calculate tectonic strain rate, tectonic stress, and normalized tectonic shear stress fields from the earthquake focal mechanisms. We show that this field changes over time, and is therefore far from being constant. Further on, we focus our efforts on the analysis of the relationship between the magnitudes of the earthquakes and the normalized tectonic shear stress. We discover a new and previously unknown physical law, which we call the maximum magnitude law (MM-law). We discuss further the origin and physical background of this law and its importance in earthquake studies.\n               ","175":"\n                  This report opens a new window on Quaternary tectonics of the Outer Western Carpathians.

Quaternary gravels bearing fractured clasts are widespread within the area, we observed them in 180 exposures. In the Carpathian Foredeep and in the Outer Carpathians excluding the NSIB, the exposures of gravels bearing fractured clasts are located largely close to (<2\u00a0km) all major overthrusts and close to (<0.75\u00a0km) the cross-fold faults of the Skawa River Fault System (SRFS). The clast-cutting fractures are mostly joints attesting to widespread Quaternary tectonic activity of the faults. Moreover, the density of occurrence of gravels bearing fractured clasts is considerably higher within the NSIB than in other parts of the study area. Furthermore, our results shed new light on the seismic hazard in the study area. In our interpretation, the clast-cutting fractures are damage resulting from coseismic rupturing of underlying bedrock faults or from regional seismic shaking. We conclude that in the study area the seismic hazard posed by natural seismicity can matter only in case of planning there the erection of critical structures like nuclear power plants, nuclear waste repositories or gas storage facilities. On the other hand, we infer that the appreciable seismic hazard is near the cross-fold faults of the SRFS, due to the location of \u015awinna Por\u0119ba Artificial Lake there, which can lead to triggering significant seismicity in the area. Furthermore, we suggest that fractured clasts can serve worldwide as providers of information on paleoseismicity and can be useful for mapping blind faults.\n               ","176":"\n                  Surface displacement is critical to assess the seismic potential of an active fault. Its distribution along strike is strongly variable, and its detection is sometimes ambiguous in soft and poorly consolidated sediments. Here we show that ground penetrating radar (GPR), supported by geological and geomorphological data, is effective in revealing the total throw on an active fault, including brittle and ductile deformational components. We studied throws that occurred along the Delta Fault during the 1862 Tsagan earthquake on Lake Baikal. The motion on that fault was measured along a stepped system of normal ruptures, in which the main plane dips to the NW at 56\u201376\u00b0. The total throws of Holocene sediments, from GPR data, vary from 1.81 to 9.59\u00a0m. The contribution of the ductile component to the offset was between 13 and 42%. Its maximum values correspond to minimum dip values of the main fault plane and the largest widths of the fault damage zone. The width also correlates well with the total vertical displacement. Consequently, the structural features of the rupture zone and the variable distribution of offsets in soft sediments of mixed behaviour should be properly considered when estimating the magnitudes of normal fault earthquakes.\n               ","177":"\n                  The Neogene and Quaternary tectonic evolution of the inner Northern Apennines (i.e southern Tuscany and northern Tyrrhenian Sea), as well as its crustal features (i.e. low crustal thickness, Neogene-Quaternary magmatism, widespread geothermal anomalies, lateral segmentation of the stacked tectonic units, extensive deep sedimentary basins), are framed in different geodynamic scenarios: compressional, extensional or both, pulsing. Consequently, the basin and range structure that characterises the northern Tyrrhenian Sea and southern Tuscany is considered as a consequence of (i) out-of-sequence thrusts and related thrust-top-basins, (ii) polyphased normal faulting that formed horst and graben structures or (iii) a combination of both. This paper provides a new dataset from a sector of the eastern inner Northern Apennines (i.e. Monti del Chianti - Monte Cetona ridge) contributing to this scientific debate. New fieldwork and structural analysis carried out in selected areas along the ridge allowed to define the chronology of the main tectonic events on the basis of their influence on the marine and continental sedimentation. The dataset supports for early Miocene - (?) Serravallian in-sequence and out-of-sequence thrusting. Thrusting produced complex staking patterns of Tuscan and Ligurian Units. Extensional detachments developed since later middle Miocene and controlled the Neogene sedimentation in bowl-shaped structural depressions, later dissected by normal faults enhancing the accommodation space for Pliocene marine deposits in broad NNW-trending basins (Siena-Radicofani and Valdichiana Basins). In this perspective, no data supports for active, continuous or pulsing, compressional tectonics after late Serravalian. As a result, in the whole inland inner Northern Apennines the extensional tectonics was continuously active at least since middle Miocene and controlled the basins development, magmatism and structure of the crust and lithosphere.\n               ","178":"\n                  Using outcrop-based examples, we investigate the topological and graph characteristics of various fault damage zones in carbonate rocks on Malta. The damage zone fracture networks are analysed as a series of nodes (isolated I-nodes; connected Y\/X-nodes) and branches (II-, IC-, CC-branches), which may link to form connected components and fracture-bounded regions. We compare the metrics of the different nodes, branches, regions and components that make-up each damage zone fracture network, calculating parameters that assess their connectivity. Results identify distinct topological signatures and graph metrics for different tip-, relay- and splay-damage zones, providing a new classification that describes and quantifies their arrangement and connectivity. Placing the studied damage zones in a fault evolutionary model highlights topological pathways whereby tip-damage zones, dominated by I-nodes and II-branches, give way to relay-damage zones, dominated by Y-nodes and CC-branches. During this process, tree-like components link to form larger interconnected components with many regions. This systematically changes the graph metrics of the network increasing the number of branches and regions relative to nodes and components. The topological pathways and graph metrics provide important insights into how damages zones might develop as faults propagate, interact and link and could have implications when assessing their importance for fluid-flow.\n               ","179":"\n                  We present a methodology to determine the stress field based on the analysis of 3D seismic reflection data without additional information from wells.

Fold hinges-faults intersections provide piercing points and fault slip vectors, which can be processed in the same way as slickenlines. Four seismic horizons and 51 faults in the Archinsk field, West Siberian Basin, were analyzed. The resulting fault-slip dataset is heterogeneous and has 126 slip vectors, corresponding to normal and strike-slip faulting. A normal stress regime with stress ratio (\u03a6) of 0.5 and a NE-trending minimum principal stress (\u03c33) is identified for the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic.

Here, we investigate the fault slip profiles of the 60-km-long Theistareykir rift (northern Iceland) that may suggest the direction of along-axis rift propagation. This is one of the few places on Earth where rifting processes and mid-oceanic ridge formation can be studied directly. Moreover, this rift hosts an active central volcano, and this enables to fully understand the relations between rift propagation and magma systems. We reconstructed the slip profiles of all the 281 main Pleistocene-Holocene faults that compose this N-S rift, by merging measurements performed in the field, collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle surveys, and derived from Digital Surface Models. Results indicate that north of the volcano, 75% of the asymmetric faults propagated northward; the value increases to 82% if the cumulated fault length is considered. South of the volcano, 47% of the asymmetric faults propagated southward, 54% if the cumulated fault length is considered. These data point to a dominant mechanism of along-axis propagation of the rift outward from the volcano, suggesting a genetic link with the underlying magma chamber. Two possible processes are suggested, which can also occur in combination: i) faults develop following lateral dyke propagation outward from the magma chamber, and ii) faults nucleate near the volcano as a consequence of the different crustal rock rheology produced by a higher heat flux. The rift architecture is complicated by the presence of tectonic zones with different dominant fault dips, separated by transversal accommodation zones.

These basins are usually explained as the result of thick-skinned extension, while other important factors such as sediment loading and subsalt basin configuration are not commonly addressed. We use sandbox models, 3D reconstruction of the models\u2019 final stage, and structural restoration to evaluate the impact of sediment loading, thick-skinned extension, and different basin configurations on the suprasalt structural style and the spatial and temporal distribution of salt structures in these basins. Models simulating sediment loading display expulsion rollovers and younger salt structures in the progradation direction. In contrast, thick-skinned extension models display stacked depocenters near basin-boundary faults and opposite timing of diapir growth. Along strike changes in basin configuration and subsalt faults impact salt flow and salt structures as follows: (1) Faults perpendicularly facing the sediment progradation contribute to the formation of salt diapirs, (2) Oblique faults favour salt flow along strike, (3) Fault intersections cause salt inflation and salt diapirs, and (4) Basin confinement by graben narrowing or intrabasinal faults produces along-strike differences in the timing of salt mobilization. The sandbox models show close resemblance and are directly comparable to seismic sections through the Nordkapp Basin (Norwegian Barents Sea) and other salt-bearing rift basins with similar configuration.\n               ","182":"\n                  The Dezful embayment in Zagros has traditionally been interpreted as a typical fold belt with multiple detachment levels, including a lower detachment at the basement-cover interface and an upper detachment along the Miocene Gachsaran halite-bearing evaporites. This paper constrains diapiric processes in the Gachsaran detachment coeval with regional shortening that resulted in complex and hitherto unstudied salt structures and flanking synclinal minibasins. In this paper, well-tied seismic interpretation is integrated with field and remote-sensing mapping, cross-section construction, and stepwise tectono-sedimentary restoration. The results indicate that after the deposition of Mishan\u2013lower Aghajari pre-kinematic overburden sediments, detachment folding initiated above the Gachsaran evaporites during late Tortonian times as a result of regional shortening. The salt-cored anticlines later actively pierced their roof to subsequently rise as passive diapirs and evolve into salt walls. Synclinal minibasins developed due to salt evacuation into flanking walls during the deposition of the Lahbari Mb. in Messinian\u2013Pliocene. Remarkable sedimentary thickening and lateral shifts in minibasin depocenter towards the salt walls, accompanied by overturned collars and hook halokinetic sequences, are diagnostics of near-surface, syndepositional passive growth of diapirs during this stage. From Pliocene to recent, the major episode of regional shortening has squeezed these precursor salt walls to form thrust-welds. In conclusion, the well-exposed structures of south Dezful show an early shortening stage, then a transition to a combination of shortening and passive diapirism, and final thrusting along diapirs. This evolution model may be more common in other salt-influenced fold-thrust belts than is currently recognized.\n               ","183":"\n                  The Borborema Province (NE Brazil) is characterized by the development of continental-scale transcurrent shear zones related to the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano-Pan-African Orogeny. These shear zones commonly border Cretaceous intraplate sedimentary basins. This work presents a structural and microstructural study of the Cruzeiro do Nordeste shear zone (CNSZ), which limits the northern border of the Jatob\u00e1 Basin. The ductile deformation of the CNSZ is marked by high-angle, ENE-trending foliation bearing subhorizontal stretching lineation, with numerous kinematic indicators showing dextral shearing. We documented a continuous transition from high-temperature (high-T) to low-temperature (low-T) (c. 650\u00a0\u00b0C to c. 300\u00a0\u00b0C) ductile fabrics characterized, at the high-T end, by quartz recrystallization by grain boundary migration and feldspar recrystallization by subgrain rotation, and, at the low-T end, by bulging recrystallization of quartz and extensive fracturing of feldspars. The cooler semi-brittle to brittle deformation superimposed on the mylonites is characterized by conjugate pairs of strike-slip mesoscopic faults. The orientation of these faults (WNW-ESE, dextral, and N\u2013S, sinistral) suggests they were formed under the same stress field than the ductile fabrics and thus evidence a continuum deformational from the ductile to the brittle field associated with exhumation during transcurrent tectonics. Brittle reactivation of the CNSZ is characterized by normal faults overprinting the mylonitic foliation. We report a U\u2013Pb age from fault-hosted calcite slickenfibres of 135\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7\u00a0Ma, which provides constraints on the timing of brittle reactivation that can be associated with opening of the South Atlantic Ocean.\n               ","184":"\n                  Crustal-scale continental strike-slip fault systems are typically thought to be thermally segregated into an upper seismogenic expression and a lower zone of ductile deformation likely extending into the lower crust.

The Cora Lake shear zone in the western Churchill Province of the Canadian Shield is a 4\u20137\u00a0km wide zone of granulite-to upper amphibolite-facies mylonite which hosts synkinematic pseudotachylyte, suggesting a locally strong lower crust. Kilometer-scale mapping suggests that the shear zone localized at a major lithological and terrane boundary, with the pseudotachylyte network centered within the ca. 1\u00a0km-wide more intensely deformed, finer-grained ultramylonitic core. In this contribution, we use optical petrography and electron-backscatter diffraction to describe microstructure across a transect of the Cora Lake shear zone. By combining these observations with grain size piezometry, experimental flow laws, and regional pressure-temperature paths, we conclude that stress amplification from a relatively common type of km-scale lithological heterogeneity and cooling history is the most reasonable explanation for the deep crustal pseudotachylyte.\n               ","185":"\n                  The present study was focused on analysis of the geometrical and topological features of the lineament network in the Gorce Mountains, Polish Outer Carpathians.

The topological analysis represented the first attempt to apply research of this type in the Polish Carpathians. Five lithostratigraphic units occurring in the research area, characteristic of the Krynica Zone of the Magura Nappe, were selected for analysis. Topology was studied for each of the units separately as well as for the whole area. It was found that the units were differentiated in terms of some topological parameters, such as 2D intensity. Moreover, latitudinal trends were observed due to the presence of wide fault zones. The geometry of the network is consistent with the general Carpathian overview. Sets of conjugate strike slip-faults with splaying ends were identified. In the southern part of the area, the strike of the oldest faults was E-W. This shows that on the scale of the observation (hundreds to thousands of metres), the network was a product of general thrusting processes rather than derivative of a local structural plan. The applicability of both topological analyses and high-resolution DEM as supplementary to classical methods in a study of the Outer Carpathians was confirmed with analysis conducted, despite the identification of some limitations, such as GIS-operator-related bias.

This is done using a multiscale workflow which integrates seismic fault and fracture detection with borehole image log interpretation from three horizontal well sections. The results show that faults and fractures are prevalent in the Ekofisk Formations. Within the study area, faults are mainly organised in three orientations: 1) WNW-ESE, 2) NNE-SSW and 3) NNW-SSE. Smaller E-W striking faults are also observed. The interpreted fractures show a similar pattern and are organized in four orientation groups: NW-SE, WNW-ESE, ENE-WSW and NE-SW. The analysis of seismic discontinuity data (i.e. faults and fractures detectable on seismic) indicates that most small-scale discontinuities occur in proximity to large faults, and that the Lower Ekofisk Formation is characterized by more widespread \u2013 and a higher intensity of small-scale seismic discontinuities. It is also demonstrated that along each studied well section, the extracted seismic discontinuities show a qualitative correlation with the image log interpretation. This correlation suggests that the 3D seismic discontinuity cube can serve as a proxy for the fault and fracture network in the southern part of the Ekofisk Chalk Field.

Generally, hydrostructural behavior falls within standard Andersonian \u03bb-depth conditions. However, field examples suggest that non-Andersonian axial stresses may sustain fluid pressures that depart from the standard Andersonian condition: the lowest fluid pressures occur under subvertical axial compression and subhorizontal axial tension; and the highest fluid pressures occur under subvertical axial tension and subhorizontal axial compression. Since around 15% of global stress compilations correspond to one of these categories, it follows that a significant portion of tectonic regimes potentially define a hydrostructural infrastructure different from standard Andersonian crust.\n               ","190":"\n                  The complex geometry and tectonic evolution of the Saharan-Tunisian Southern Atlas strike-slip fault systems, North Africa, have not been investigated comprehensively to date.

The microscale observations are combined with outcrop observations from previous studies to provide insight into the origin of the BPFs and their evolution during successive phases of deformation in a basin that had a polyphase tectonic history. The BPFs slipped while normal faults were formed during the Oligocene extension. Then, another phase of slip occurred later during the basin inversion.

In addition, calcite veins with an elongate blocky morphology suggest an opening normal to bedding before the reactivation. The BPFs initiated in clay layers that were shallow dipping. Such conditions may appear mechanically unfavourable for an opening normal to bedding or a shearing parallel to bedding. We suggest that the role of rock anisotropy is critical.

Geophysical investigations were conducted at selected sites using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to understand the shallow subsurface geometry and trace the continuity of faults buried below patchy alluvial cover. 15\u201317\u00a0m long, 2D GPR cross-sections were recorded across faults using monostatic antenna of 200\u00a0MHz frequency.\n                  Two major deformation events \u2013 D1 and D2 are determined in the present study.

The platform is flat-lying undeformed except from low-relief anticlines and domes, at which the strata hosts the world's most prolific petroleum reserves. The strata exhibit stylolites and veins, besides the dominant fractures. The fractures are opening-mode, steep, and forming major sets of NW\u2013SE and NE\u2013SW orientations. Faults are uncommon. Fracture abundance varies significantly across the platform, but it is constrained spatially by inherent variation in mechanical stratigraphy and temporally by anticlinal growth and isotope geochemistry. In early burial stages, the platform strata were slightly deformed by bed-parallel stylolites and mutually crosscutting veins. The strata fracturing increased by the anticlinal growth in the Late Cretaceous. Fracture spacing is an average of 2\u00a0m in the horizontal-bedded outcrops in Central Arabia and 0.30\u00a0m in the equivalent subsurface in a dome in Eastern Arabia. The dome is an end member in the deformation spectrum of the platform interior, with up to c. 5\u00b0 structural dip and 2% dilational strain expressed in the doming and a few major faults.

In many brittle faults, graphitic carbon is often associated with gouge or low-grade metamorphic rocks whereas in ductile faults, graphitic carbon commonly occurs in marble, schist or gneiss. Carbonaceous material gradually transforms from an amorphous into an ordered crystalline structure by increasing thermal metamorphism. The degree of graphitization is believed to be a reliable indicator of peak temperature conditions in the metamorphic rock. In this contribution, based on detailed field observations, the variably deformed and metamorphosed graphitic gneisses to phyllites, located within the footwall and hangingwall unit of the Cenozoic Ailaoshan-Red River strike-slip shear zone are studied. According to lithological features and temperatures determined by Raman spectra of carbonaceous material, these graphitic rocks and deformation fabrics are divided into three types. Type I is represented by medium-grade metamorphism and strongly deformed rocks with an average temperature of 509\u00a0\u00b0C and a maximum temperature of 604\u00a0\u00b0C. Type II is affected by low-grade metamorphism and deformed rocks with an average temperature of 420\u00a0\u00b0C. Type III is affected by lower-grade metamorphism and occurs in weakly deformed\/undeformed rocks with an average temperature of 350\u00a0\u00b0C. Slip-localized micro-shear zones and laterally continuous or discontinuous slip-planes constituted by graphitic carbon aggregates are developed in Types I and II. The electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) lattice preferred orientation (LPO) patterns of graphitic carbon grains were firstly observed in comparison with LPO patterns of quartz and switch from basal <a>, rhomb <a> to prism<a> slip systems, which indicate increasing deformation temperatures. Comparison of quartz and graphite LPOs indicates that graphite LPOs show higher temperature conditions. According to the graphitic slip-planes, micro-shear zones with grain-size reduction and mylonitic foliation constituted by graphitic carbon minerals, we also propose that the development of fine-grained amorphous carbon plays an important role in rheological weakening of the whole rock during progressive ductile shearing.\n               ","195":"\n                  We focus on the Neogene\u2013Quaternary tectonic evolution of the Lake Van Basin located within the Turkish-Iranian Plateau.

Phase 2 is characterized in fluvial and lake deposits of the Middle Pleistocene, deformed by dominant contraction stress regime effective along NW-SE direction. The late Pleistocene tectonic regime (Phase 3) consists of transpressional deformation that develops under NNW-SSE compression and ENE-WSW extension.

We integrated and interpreted potential field, 2D and 3D reflection seismic, and well data to study the role of structural inheritance in controlling the location and development of the southern part of the Klakk Fault Complex, offshore mid-Norway. The down-to-the-west Klakk Fault Complex is an N-S non-collinear fault complex that separates the Fr\u00f8ya High in its footwall from the R\u00e5s Basin in its hanging wall. The fault segments vary from low-angle planar to listric fault geometries in cross-section, with displacements of 17\u00a0km\u201334\u00a0km. These displacements led to syn-rift basement thinning of 12\u201314\u00a0km toward the west, which consequently, also affected the crustal wedge geometry of the necking domains. We identify three intra-acoustic-basement structures based on seismic facies and define their 3D geometry: (i) a bowl-shaped basin, (ii) a hyperbolic surface, and (iii) a domal structure. We discuss their origin and elucidate their role during later rifting. We conclude that pre-existing basement structures controlled the rift-related structures during the second rift phase (thinning), and affected the location, geometries, orientation and segmentation of the high-displacement low-angle faults in the necking domains. The results of this work offer new insights into the development of necking domains in areas where a thick continental crust (>25\u00a0km) is present during rifting.\n               ","197":"\n                  Faults vary in structural style, from simple planes to complex systems composed of fault cores and damage zones. Increased fault complexity results from the interaction of mechanical and chemical processes, including fracture growth, shear, and linkage, and mineral dissolution and precipitation. Although water-rock interaction is traditionally associated with fault rock weakening and shear localization, we investigate processes of fault core widening by water-rock interactions that resulted in quartz precipitation. We combine field and petrographic observations with prior mechanical characterization to assess the impact of alteration and cementation on fault architecture at the Dixie Comstock epithermal gold deposit, Nevada, USA. Mineralized portions of the fault contain strong, thick, silicified fault cores and wide, weak damage zones, with evidence for widening of the core through entrainment of damage zone material and repeated cycles of embrittlement, dilation, and cementation. We present a model of fault zone evolution in which the hydrothermal regimes favoring either alteration-weakening or precipitation-strengthening result in distinct fault zone architecture and mechanical and flow properties of fault systems. Alteration-weakening favors localization of the fault into thinner, clay-rich, low permeability fault cores. Precipitation-strengthening promotes thick, strong, and low permeability fault cores, with mineralization-embrittlement enhancing transient permeability following coseismic failure.\n               ","198":"\n                  It is unclear how the crustal-scale erosional exhumation of continental domains of the Moroccan Atlantic margin and the excessive subsidence of its rifted domains affected the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous post-rift evolution of the margin. To constrain the km-scale exhumation, we study the structural evolution of the Jbel Amsittene. This anticline is located on the coastal plain of the Moroccan Atlantic margin, and is classically considered to have been developed initially in the Late Cretaceous by halokinesis, and by contraction during the Neogene. Contrarily, our structural analysis indicates that the anticline is a fault-propagation fold verging north with Triassic salts at its core and that it formed by shortening shortly after continental breakup of the Central Atlantic. The anticline grew by NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW contraction, as shown by syn-tectonic wedges, regional kinematic indicators and synsedimentary structures in Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous rocks. It grew further and tightened during the Cenozoic, presumably in relation to the Atlas\/Alpine contraction. Thus, our data and interpretation suggest that \u201ctectonic-drives-salt\u201d in the anticline early growth, which is coeval with the growth of other anticlines along the Moroccan Atlantic margin and widespread km-scale exhumation farther onshore.

We present field, microstructural and chemical observations from slip surfaces below and within the deposit which show varying degrees of strain localisation. At one locality the basal shear zone is localised to a 1\u20132\u00a0cm thick, extremely sheared layer of mixed ultracataclasite and pseudotachylyte containing fragments of earlier frictional melts. Rheological modelling indicates brittle fragmentation of the melt may have occurred due to high strain rates, at velocities of >31\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 and that frictional melting is unlikely to provide a mechanism for basal lubrication. Elsewhere, we observe a ~40\u00a0cm thick basal shear zone, overprinted by sub-parallel faults that truncate topological asperities to localise strain. We also observe shear zones within the avalanche deposit, suggesting that strain was partitioned. In conclusion, we find that deformation mechanisms fluctuated between cataclasis and frictional melting during emplacement of the volcanic debris avalanche; exhibiting strain partitioning and variable shear localisation, which, along with underlying topography, changed the resistance to flow and impacted runout distance.\n               ","200":"\n                  Clay minerals often constitute a significant proportion of fault cores, yet the physics of clay friction, in particular the effect of free and interstitial bound (interlayer) water, is poorly understood. Understanding the behaviour of this typically frictionally weak component is fundamental to constraining the larger scale behaviour of fault zones. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted on synthetic clay fault gouges under carefully controlled saturation states. Samples were sheared at room temperature under triaxial pressure at the following conditions: water saturated; room humidity; thermally dried then sheared at room humidity; in a vacuum at room humidity; thermally dried then sheared in a vacuum; in a vacuum and thermally dried within the pressure vessel. Friction coefficient (\u03bc) is shown to increase with \u2018dryness\u2019 by a factor of 3 in 2:1 smectite and a factor of 2 in 1:1 sheet silicate, with largest increases in thermally dried samples.

The amount of displacement or time required to establish a new steady state \u03bc upon a change in sliding velocity (dc) decreases markedly in drier samples. Results suggest that the presence of water is key in promoting time and slip dependent frictional changes, constraining operative grain-scale deformation mechanisms to those that are fluid assisted.

The friction law is defined by the lower boundary of the cloud of points in the Mohr space represented by inherited faults. This operation fixes the abscissa origin of the Mohr diagram. To calculate the rupture law, we estimate both intact rock and outcrop quality parameters and need pairs of conjugate faults. Their dihedral angle fixes a point on the Mohr circle, where the rupture law has to be tangent, thus defining the scale of the axes and the values of the principal stresses. To define the paleo-depth, we estimate the average density of overlying rocks and the hydraulic conditions (i.e. the pore pressure).Testing of this workflow in three well-constrained geological case studies proved its promising reliability, showing a good agreement with independent stratigraphic and structural evidence.\n               ","203":"\n                  In this paper, two observations of the breather-type oscillating tectonic shear stress field in the Earth's crust are described.

The results show that the observed time-development of the normalized tectonic shear stress can be modelled as a breather, which is a spatially localized, time-periodic, oscillatory solution of the sine-Gordon equation. It represents the stress and strain fields, which periodically oscillate in time and decay in space as the distance from the center increases. Two case studies are described.

Multi-scale structural mapping in the \u00d8ygarden Complex constrains three structural levels characterized by localized shear (Upper Unit), distributed deformation (Middle Unit) and a migmatite double-dome (Lower Unit). All levels show retrogressive E-W stretching accompanied by extension-parallel recumbent folding, albeit, with opposing shear senses at upper and middle\/lower levels. The systematic comparison of 23 shear zones constrains the ductile-to-brittle structural evolution. Initially, high temperatures and partial melting controlled pervasive deep crustal flow and ductile doming. During retrogressive shearing, lithological heterogeneity controlled strain localization and channelized fluid flow causing retrograde phyllosilicate growth. This established a feedback loop of fluid-flow, fabric weakening and progressive shear localization. The interconnection of inherited and newly formed weak, phyllosilicate-rich layers promoted the formation of bivergent detachments that rapidly exhumed a dome of previously ductile crust.

Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) can provide fabric patterns which can be used to discuss the strain of the South Dabashan Belt. Rock magnetism reveals that paramagnetic minerals dominate magnetic susceptibility and some ferromagnetic minerals also exist. Magnetic fabrics of Triassic and Jurassic strata are essentially type II fabric with well-developed magnetic lineation; further, they rarely show sedimentary fabric, indicating the early stage of the deformation processes. Magnetic fabrics show that early horizontal shortening strain is characterised by a radial pattern in the South Dabashan Belt. Our results indicate that the Chengkou Fault initially formed as a normal fault with arcuate shape during the opening of the Mianlue Ocean and has a controlling effect on the formation of the curved fold-and-thrust belt.

Comprehensive analysis of the seismic data suggests that the NSB5FZ is a strike-slip fault zone, and it slipped right-laterally during the early Paleozoic with a varying slip azimuth. Three different types of responses of the late structural deformation to the pre-existing structures exist on the NSB5FZ in its evolution. During the early Paleozoic, the NSB5FZ has experienced at least three strike-slip movements. (1) Induced by the first strike-slip movement, the lower-middle Cambrian strata were folded, and positive flower structures occurred. (2) During the second strike-slip movement period, several faults were produced and arranged both left- and right-stepping. The traces of these faults were right above the faults or anticline axes at depth. Sequentially, positive and negative relief occurred right above the left and right stepovers, respectively.

Where shales are present the decoupling of layers is similar to examples previously described in the literature from outcrop and analogue models. However, more unusually, detachments are also present within limestone units. While detachment folds are typically developed above a basal weak unit (usually salt or shale), in the study area is an example developed entirely within well-bedded limestones. Instead of flow of the weak unit into the core of the fold, room problems in the core of the fold are accommodated by pressure solution parallel to bedding, thrusts, small fault propagation folds, and intense folding. Variations in structural style are largely influenced by the spacing\/intensity of bedding, limestone clay content (and the efficiency of pressure solution during deformation), and the presence\/absence and thickness of interbedded shales. A ductile detachment zone is developed between well-bedded limestones and overlying massive limestones, the detachment zone separates highly folded sequence dominated by steep dips, from a weakly folded sequence dominated by gentle dips.

Two contrasting expressions of shortening are documented. In Ordovician strata, strain requires four stages: folding, flattening through cleavage formation, low-angle faulting and local distributed shear. In the Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata, shortening is expressed as reverse faults, fault-propagation folds and dipping panels. Dissimilarities reflect different P-T conditions and amount of strain, as structures in the Ordovician rocks require higher temperatures and strain than Andean structures in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata. Furthermore, local Cretaceous AFT cooling ages in pervasively cleaved Ordovician rocks reveal these rocks did not reach temperatures compatible with cleavage formation during the Andean event.

It is widely accepted that normal faults are rarely continuous surfaces but are zones composed of fault segments, heterogeneously distributed fault rocks of various compositions, slip bands, blocks and other deformation elements. Listric normal faults, particularly those developed in metamorphic crystalline rocks or preexisting fabric-developed basements, may be composed of subparallel faults in cross-sections, linked by extensional duplex structures. Here, we choose a listric rift-bounding fault rooted in foliation developed basements, the Langshan normal fault in the northwest corner of the Ordos Block, to conduct an outcrop analysis of fault geometry and linkage behavior from cross-sectional views. The Langshan normal fault zone is composed of mixed regions of high- and low-angle segments linked by duplex structures at various scales. Mylonitic foliations play a significant role in the formation of fault segments and the evolution of the listric fault zones. Lines of evidence show that small en echelon faults initiated from preexisting foliations. Local stress perturbation between overstepping faults results in the formation of duplex structures and displays a high fracture density, which serve to the coalesce of fault segments. Consequently, the progressive localization of strain onto a large listric fault is achieved by progressive development of extensional duplexing among fault segments in cross-sections. These extensional duplexes imply a scale-invariant property, based on which we can extrapolate this pattern occurs on larger scales and is verified by seismic data. The case of Langshan piedmont fault demonstrates the possibility of a listric fault being formed by subparallel planner faults and highlights the effects of preexisting fabrics on the evolution of listric faults, especially in basement fabrics developed regions along the fault.\n               ","210":"\n                  Fault damage zones can act as a preferential corridor for fluid flow in the subsurface, and for this reason the characterization of their structure, including the attributes of the associated fracture network, is fundamental.

We study the surficial leakages of the shallow steam zone by performing a discrete fracture network model and a 3D forward strain-stress model of the upper caprock unit. The hydrothermal zones linked to steam cap leakages are subordinated to deep-rooted N60-striking faults. Associated damage zones exhibit higher values of fracture intensity, vertical and anisotropy of permeability than the host rocks. Joints and cross-joints likely control leakage zones, where the formers are subject to high dilation tendency. The Anfiteatro monocline might constitute the northwestern boundary of the shallow steam zone. Variations of H2O\u2013CO2 ratio, helium isotopic signature, and CO2 between hydrothermal zones are explained in terms of petrophysical properties of the upper ignimbrites and changes in their structural control.

Examination of faults in the Middle Silurian Tuscarora Sandstone and other quartz-rich rocks in the region has shown that the microcrystalline quartz in bands and cement in cataclasites was derived from a silica gel. The presence of comminuted grains, silica nanospheres, flow features, amorphous silica, and polygonal crystal domains of low dislocation density within microcrystalline quartz on and adjacent to the fault surfaces is interpreted as evidence of a mobile silica gel precursor. Brecciated microbreccias and mutually crosscutting relationships between microfractures, microcrystalline quartz bands, and microveins along and adjacent to fault surfaces suggest that formation of these features was cyclic.

Therefore, we kinematically assess if and when tectonic stress fields affected the Aksu basin in early Miocene to recent times. For this purpose, Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) data (AMS) of cored samples and fault-slip data from the brittle mesoscopic faults were collected. The ~490 oriented samples for Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility measurements were analyzed and two different maximum magnetic lineation's directions are recognized; 1) N\u2013S magnetic lineation in Pliocene and 2) from N\u2013S to NW-SE magnetic lineation in the Miocene. The results inferred from more than 1000 fault-slip data collected from 83 different sites combined with AMS results demonstrate that the Aksu Basin developed under four different tectonic phases; 1) ~E-W extensional phase (related to basin formation), 2) ~N\u2013S compressional (Lycian) phase, 3) ~(N)E-(S)W compressional (Aksu) phase and 4) N\u2013S extensional (Recent) phase.\n               ","216":"\n                  Off-fault damage zones comprise highly fractured rocks surrounding the dynamic slip surface of faults.

Damage zones in the brittle upper crust, reaching widths >100\u00a0m, are commonly characterized by measuring fracture density, but identifying the extent of off-fault damage in deeply exhumed faults is challenging due to post- and inter-seismic viscous\/plastic deformation. We measured fluid inclusion abundance in quartz deformed at ~400\u2013500\u00a0\u00b0C from an ancient seismogenic strike-slip fault\/shear zone to evaluate whether it can be a proxy for damage-zone width. In contrast to upper crustal fault zones displaying a high-low trend of healed microfracture density, the shear zone has a low-high-low trend of fluid inclusion abundance from the core toward the host rock. We find that pattern explicable through removal of fluid inclusions by recrystallization after co-seismic deformation, allowing us to use fluid inclusion abundance to measure damage zone extent, which is >~80\u00a0m (the low-high abundance region) from the shear zone core.

The Thyolo fault is located towards the edge of the Proterozoic Unango Terrane, and is the border fault of the Lower Shire Graben, which has experienced four phases of extension since the Jurassic. Recent activity is demonstrated by an 18.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.7\u00a0m high fault scarp, with two substantial reductions in scarp height along strike. However, the segment boundaries suggested by these displacement measurements do not coincide with changes in fault strike. Elsewhere, a ~5\u00a0km long fault perpendicular scarp joins two overlapping sections, yet the scarp height in this linking section is similar to the bounding sections, and there is no evidence of significant pre-linkage strain accumulation. Microstructural analyses along the fault show a 15\u201345\u00a0m thick footwall damage zone with a 0.7\u00a0m thick core.

Structures and various kinematic indicators record sinistral strike-slip shearing in the zone. Based on the microstructural features, crystallographic preferred orientation patterns of quartz and their slip systems, coupled with Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Materials (RSCM) geothermometry, the ductile sinistral shearing fabrics formed at upper greenschist and amphibolite facies (>500\u00a0\u00b0C). Two hornblende, one muscovite and five biotite separates from the mylonites in the shear zone were dated by the 40Ar\/39Ar method. A hornblende plateau age of 23.7\u00a0Ma is interpreted as representing or being close to the time of sinistral movement. Muscovite and biotite 40Ar\/39Ar ages from 22.9 to 16.9\u00a0Ma represent cooling ages following sinistral shearing. It is concluded on the basis of these data that the Jiali sinistral strike-slip shear zone was active in latest Oligocene. This sinistral movement on the Jiali shear zone is considered to link with the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone, and form a unique, continuous structural boundary around the EHS. The Jiali-Ailao Shan-Red River sinistral shear zone and Gaoligong dextral shear zone formed a huge conjugate strike-slip shear pair around the EHS to accommodate the N\u2013S shortening corresponding to northward indentation of the folded Indian continent.

Evidence for a collision between the intra-oceanic island arc system of the East Junggar Terrane and the active margin of the Siberian Craton (Chinese Altai Orogen) is recorded in the eastern segment of the Irtysh Shear Zone (northwestern China). Field observations from the Qinghe area show that this segment of the Irtysh Shear Zone consists of four NW\u2013SE sinistral mylonitic zones, and domains bounded by these mylonitic zones show variable fold patterns. In the northern part of the Irtysh Shear Zone (southern Chinese Altai Orogen), three generations of structures (DCA1\u2013DCA3) are recognized. The earliest generation of foliation (SCA1) is only recognized locally and is transposed to the orientation of the dominant DCA2 foliation (SCA2). The latter is associated with a shallowly plunging stretching lineation, which is sub-parallel to the NW\u2013SE hinge of DCA3 folds. These third-generation folds (DCA3) show a steeply-dipping axial plane trending NW\u2013SE. In the southern part of the Irtysh Shear Zone (northern East Junggar Terrane), the structural pattern is simpler and only involves a single generation of penetrative foliation (SEJ1). New U\u2013Pb detrital zircon and 40Ar\/39Ar data provide constraints on the timing of collision and deformation. These results suggest that the collision occurred after the Early Carboniferous, with the timing of sinistral shearing constrained to the Early\u2013Middle Permian. The combination of sinistral shearing and NW\u2013SE DCA3 folds likely represents an episode of transpressional deformation, which was driven by oblique collision between the East Junggar Terrane and the Chinese Altai Orogen during the Early\u2013Middle Permian. The occurrence of original sub-horizontal SCA2 foliation and associated orogen-parallel stretching lineation might indicate that following the initial collision (after the Early Carboniferous), the southern Chinese Altai Orogen was subjected to orogen-parallel extension. In a larger-scale context, sinistral kinematics along the Irtysh Shear Zone in northwestern China and northeastern Kazakhstan, together with coeval dextral strike-slip deformation farther south, might reflect an eastward escape of orogenic materials, possibly in response to the Permian convergence of the Siberian, Baltic, and Tarim cratons.\n               ","220":"\n                  Three crustal-scale sequentially restored cross-sections along the Central External Betic Cordillera enable us to pinpoint the role of extreme crustal thinning, tectonic inheritance and salt tectonics during the evolution of the South-Iberian paleomargin from Mesozoic rifting to Cenozoic continental subduction. This interpretation puts forward the existence of a former highly extended Mesozoic rift system, namely the Subbetic Basin. The basin comprises three main domains that coincide with the classical zoning of the External Betics: (i) The Intermediate units in the northern basin margin represent primary thick minibasins separated by salt walls; (ii) the External Subbetic units attest an inflated salt body in a central trough; and (iii) the Median and Internal Subbetic units in the southern basin margin are analogous to a group of primary minibasins with intercalations of submarine volcanic rocks overlying hyperextended crust. Shortening led to the extrusion of a salt canopy and the development of secondary minibasins. Furthermore, the tectonic inversion of the Subbetic Basin created two major thrusts sheets detached at the Upper Triassic evaporites, accommodating a shortening of \u2248100\u2013145\u00a0km\u00a0at early Eocene-middle Miocene time. Compression reshaped the hyperextended domain into a subduction trench, and the former transfer faults into tear faults.

We investigated the structural evolution and tectonic implications of the Triunfo Fault by mapping damage zone width patterns and the types and distributions of breccia and brittle structure arrays within the fault zone using scanline fracture analysis techniques and topographic and aeromagnetometric data. Fractured rocks of the damage zone mainly comprise: mylonitic orthogneiss (footwall); and sandstone and carbonate rocks (hangingwall).

Fundamentally, two criteria have been taken into account: geometric differences and differences in the strain distribution on map view.

The factors that control the evolution of these rivers in this highly active region, particularly their relative contribution through time, are not well known. Our study presents evidence that the left-lateral movement of the Haiyuan Fault (one of the largest active strike-slip faults within the Tibetan Plateau since ~13\u20138\u00a0Ma) created a series of NW-trending linear thrust-fold belts, aligned in an en echelon pattern along the trace of the fault. This completely reconfigured the flow direction of the rivers within the Qilian Shan Range: from N-S rivers that flowed into the Hexi Corridor and Qaidam Basin, to today's W-E rivers flowing into the Tarim Basin and Longxi Basin, along a series of NW-trending linear thrust-folds belt, aligned in an en echelon pattern along the trace of the Haiyuan Fault on the north and south. This river system reorganization event is corroborated by sedimentary and geochronologic evidence within the intermountain basins where these rivers flow. The Longxi Basin, the largest intermountain basin surrounding the Qilian Shan on the east, was drained by rivers flowing east, which were dammed by the uplift of the Liupan Shan since ~10\u20138\u00a0Ma to form a large lake. The second river system reorganization again occurred through climate change in ~1.8\u00a0Ma. It included the incision of the Yellow River capturing major rivers and halting their flow to the southeast.

With the data presented in this research paper, we argue that the temperature sensitivity recorded in the mechanical data is caused by viscous deformation of the amorphous material. We suggest that with the formation of amorphous materials during brittle deformation, fault rheology becomes significantly temperature-sensitive. This has important implications for our understanding of fault strength and weakening due to the presence of amorphous materials.

An updated strain analysis allows us to determine that deformation of the MIZ was dominated by a constrictive-type of strain. We build on a previously proposed conceptual model to document ductile extrusion over basement ramps driven by tectonic forcing and lateral density contrast in the upper crust at ca. 990 Ma.

Rock-fluid interaction was characterized by a high-mobility of K-rich fluids, with K-feldspar decorating the SC\/SCC\u2032 foliation, infiltrating fractures in the damage zone of the faults and precipitating as idiomorphic crystals in open cavities and along the fault surface.

This study gives a new approach, the HGA, that combines the two issues in a single step process and gives the stress tensors directly. The given heterogeneous data are directly operated upon by the genetic algorithm operators, initialization, elitism, selection, encoding, crossover and mutation. These operations simulate such a guided search that finds successively fitter solutions, the stress tensors, until the globally fittest solution is obtained.

Using an extensive 3D seismic data set and age data, the total cumulative strain (shortening) and interval strain rates have been calculated for 11 thrust-related folds mapped in the toe-thrust region of the southern lobe of the Niger Delta. For the first time, the sequence of thrust nucleation, propagation and linkage through time at a scale of 10\u00a0s\u00a0km both along and across strike is documented. Short thrust segments had nucleated throughout the entire study area by 15\u00a0Ma. They then grew largely by lateral growth and linkage, increasing the fault trace length and generating asymmetric strain-distance plots, for the first 50% of their history. Thereafter, growth continued by shortening, with minimal along strike increase in fault length. Changes in shortening-distance data between adjacent structures across strike suggest that the change in growth mode occurred once the thrusts had linked in 3D through the common underlying detachment. Over the entire thrust array the strain rate varies through time, starting slowly (<200\u00a0m\/Ma), then increasing between 9.5 and 3.7\u00a0Ma (200\u2013400\u00a0m\/Ma) before slowing down in the last\u00a0~\u00a04\u00a0Ma (<150\u00a0m\/Ma). The variation in strain rate is attributed to a change in boundary conditions of the gravitational system. An increase in sediment supply to the delta occurred in the late Miocene-Pliocene, driving higher shortening rates in the toe area. A subsequent reduction in sediment supply in the last ~4\u00a0Ma led to a reduction in deformation rate and the cessation of activity on a number of the thrusts. Predictions of the critical taper wedge model are used to explain the near-synchronous growth of the entire thrust array over the last 15\u00a0Ma. Because sedimentation acts to lower the surface slope, the wedge can only continue to deform if shortening occurs over a wide area allowing the surface slope to build up.

Deformation bands and black gouges accommodated displacement between 0.2 and 20\u00a0cm. Microstructural observations and quantitative image analysis pointed out that particulate flow operated during the early stages of faulting, followed by cataclasis after significant porosity loss.

Inelastic constitutive relationships allow permanent strains to develop in response to the applied loads. FE-modelling results show that oblique convergence is accommodated by discrete deformation at the main pre-existing inclined faults (=70\u00b0) and by distributed brittle and ductile deformation at active blocks. Oblique contraction at the active blocks resulted mainly in layer-parallel shortening, orthogonal to the model outer boundaries, whereas thickening in the horizontal and vertical directions was accommodated via layer-parallel, fault strike-parallel extension and up-dip extrusion (i.e., inclined extrusion). Lateral extrusion should have compensated the rest and\/or volume loss took place. Folding and thickening of the mobile backstop produced a non-cylindrical, asymmetric, bi-vergent anticline where permanent strains developed principally in the steep forelimb. Secondary, conjugate fault zones also accommodate oblique slip and contribute to uplift. Displacement vectors within the transpression zone are rotated counter-clockwise (ca. 20\u00b0\u201330\u00b0) with respect to vectors in the fixed backstop. Areas with higher rotation values seem to correlate with those showing higher ellipticity values. The presence of pre-existing faults favored strain partitioning from the onset of deformation. FE-modelling results compared with analytical, natural example, and analogue modelling results show that our mechanical modelling can overall match inclined transpression zones geometry that present different modes of strain partitioning and localisation.\n               ","238":"\n                  Glacitectonically thrusted blocks of unlithified sediment are commonly inferred to have been frozen during thrusting, with implications for paleoclimate and glacier dynamics. We inferred strain patterns within thrusted blocks of glaciolacustrine mud in the Rubjerg Knude and M\u00f8ns Klint glacitectonic complexes of coastal Denmark to try to assess whether the mud was frozen during thrusting. Fabrics based on the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) of the muds are interpreted with results of ring-shear experiments and models of AMS fabric development during layer-parallel shortening (LPS). In intact distal stratigraphy, fabrics indicate moderate LPS. Fabrics where thrusts have disrupted more proximal stratigraphy indicate rotation of mud sheets during thrusting with insufficient penetrative strain to reset the LPS fabric. The exception is within decimeters of faults at Rubjerg Knude where shear overprinted the LPS fabric. Although these data indicate that mud sheets were mostly rigid during thrusting, this is not necessarily evidence of permafrost. Critical-taper theory indicates that even a gentle slope of the proglacial surface away from the glacier margin would have allowed slip without internal deformation of thrust sheets, requiring only minimal pore-water pressures.\n               ","239":"\n                  Dolostones in a Neogene strike-slip fault zone are described.

(ii) Fault-related features include breccias and cataclasites. Orthorhombic rock lithons are generated from the intersection of fracture sets with bedding and\/or joints.

Topology is analysed using nodes and branches, ranging from isolated (I- node and I-I branch) to connected (Y- and X-nodes, and I-C to C-C branches) respectively. The quantitative description of the geometrical and topological analysis of the dolostone lithons suggest that they become more connected and interact within the dolostone fault blocks.

Noise in these datasets is attributed to large subsidiary faults or random natural variation. Through a field study of the Borrego Fault (Baja California) damage zone, combining mm-resolution structural mapping and point sampling, we show that such variations are the expression of systematic damage heterogeneity. The oblique-slip Borrego Fault comprises NW and SE segments that ruptured during the Mw7.2 2010\u00a0El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. Measurements of fracture density along eight linear fault-perpendicular transects and from a high-resolution 68\u00a0m2 structural map display a power law decay and define footwall damage zone widths of ~85\u00a0m and ~120\u00a0m for the NW and SE segments respectively. Variance in fracture density decays with distance following an inverse exponential relationship, to background variance at ~16\u00a0m. Spatial analysis of the high-resolution fracture map reveals a patchy distribution of high- and low-intensity clusters at metre- and decimetre-scales. We attribute high-intensity clusters at these scales to local complexity caused by interactions between minor subsidiary faults (101\u00a0m length and 10\u22122-10\u22121\u00a0m displacement). Fracture density differences between high- and low-intensity clusters decrease with distance from the fault, demonstrating a systematic change in outcrop-scale damage heterogeneity.

Summed throw-rates across strike achieve values as high as 0.3\u20131.6\u00a0mm\/yr, values that are comparable to those at the centre of the crustal-scale fault (2\u20133\u00a0mm\/yr from Holocene palaeoseismology and 3\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr from GPS geodesy). The relatively high deformation rate and distributed deformation in the tip zone are discussed in terms of stress enhancement from rupture of neighbouring crustal-scale faults and in terms of how this should be considered during fault-based seismic hazard assessment.\n               ","242":"\n                  Due to strain energy releases sharply, fault slip is often accompanied with sudden stress change around fault structures, especially on the fault surface. In this study, the slippage of a reverse fault structure induced by coal mining in Yima mining area, Henan province, China is studied by employing physical and numerical simulation. The stress evolution around this fault is analyzed to further understand the mechanism of coal bursts around the fault structures. The results show that the normal stress is relatively greater than shear stress on the fault surface, and the normal and shear stress on the fault surface near the coal seam are greater than that far away from the coal seam. It is interesting to find that the variation of normal stress and shear stress on the middle of fault is opposite in the physical model. To in-depth understand this phenomenon, the numerical simulation method is employed to investigate the stress variation and dynamic energy evolution on the fault surface before, during and after fault slip by applied different horizontal stress on the lateral surface of model. The results show that the opposite variation of normal and shear stress is induced by the greater horizontal stress. This phenomenon can be considered as a precursory information for major fault slip. The horizontal stress is the main driving force of the fault slip induced by the coal seam mining. In this study, it is also suggested that the existence of extra-thick conglomerate rock and reverse fault in the high horizontal stress environment could cause large area of roof movement and provide the dynamic pressure source for the occurrence of coal bursts in Yima mining area.\n               ","243":"\n                  Extensive opencast lignite mining in the Ptolemais Basin, NW Greece has exposed a plethora of outcrops within a normal fault system offsetting a sequence of interbedded lignites and marls of Pliocene age. The entire length of a 630\u00a0m long fault over a vertical interval of 80\u00a0m has been mapped in detail from 48 mine faces. The mapped fault comprises 5 fault segments large enough to be mapped in 3D, smaller fault segments exposed on individual mine faces and associated continuous deformation in the form of bed rotations and normal drag. These fault components combined to provide a regular aggregate throw distribution over the mapped fault. The boundaries between adjacent fault segments have a variety of geometries and they may be fully unconnected or they may link along strike or down dip within the fault zone. The fault geometry and throw distribution is analysed using two approaches, a discrete mapping of the large fault segments and a continuous approach based on measures of fault thickness and throw partitioning at individual outcrops. This combination of approaches demonstrates that fault thickness and the proportion of fault throw on the individual fault segments observed on any cross-section through the fault are related almost entirely to fault segmentation in 3D.\n               ","244":"\n                  Well-exposed normal fault networks in the Plio-Quaternary sedimentary series of the Zanjan Depression, Iran, were studied in order to analyse the spatial relationships and evolution of fault and damage zone structures in low-burial (~200\u00a0m) conditions. Despite the poorly-consolidated, geologically young nature of sediment, fault networks show several characteristics more typical of faulting in lithified strata. Key controls on the evolution of fault networks are found to be fault interactions, segment linkage, and the mechanical stratigraphy resulting in dip refraction, fault segmentation, the development of fault bends and steps, vertical fault overlap zone breaching, and bed-parallel slip. The data show a decrease of fracture frequency away from the fault cores. The obtained data show that damage zones width increases with fault displacement in a non-linear manner. Furthermore, damage zones appear more deformed and wider in the hanging-wall than in the footwall. A plot of damage zone width versus total fault throw reveals a positive but non-linear correlation, and the best-fit function corresponds better to a power-law relationship. The relationship between displacement and length shows a sub-vertical growth path with large displacement gradients typical of faulting in partially-lithified strata, due to shale ductility accommodating fault tip-related strains. A model for the evolution of the normal fault system is proposed based on spatial distribution of deformation, particularly fault segmentation, segment linkage, and damage zone development, as influenced by initial fault spacing, mechanical stratigraphy and the low burial conditions.\n               ","245":"\n                  Fault inversion may lead to significant obliteration of earlier tectonic structures, thus preventing the straightforward interpretation of the complete kinematics and deformation history of faults.\n                  We adopt a multidisciplinary approach to: (1) reconstruct the tectonic evolution through space and in time of the extensionally-inverted Mt.

It is little studied, its tectonic behavior is unknown, and its role among the other active fault branches of the restraining bend is the least defined. It was mapped as a discontinuous array of fault segments, with minor displacements and tectonically undisturbed basaltic cover. We studied the Hasbaya fault with detailed field mapping, and combining geomorphology, structural geology, and active tectonic investigations. The results reveal little and localized faulting along the entire length of the fault, with no signs of tectonic correlation between the drainage network evolution and the tectonic activity of the fault. The absence of active-tectonic surface features along the Hasbaya fault trend indicates that it does not manifest enough surface evidence to be classified as a tectonically active structure within the Lebanese Restraining Bend, and subsequently does not appear to be a major source of seismic hazard in the region. It may be related to the subsurface structure that controls the monocline that forms the western flank of Mount Hermon, or it may represent the remnant of an old suture zone between Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon as a part of the regional compression imposed across the restraining bend.

This locality presents an artificially exhumed portion of an active fault plane, thus providing a unique opportunity to study kinematics and limestone scarp morphology (including its curvature and roughness). The survey of 2015 offered a high-density point cloud of the fault scarp with 6-mm working resolution, creating a very close to real life representation 3D model. We found that scarp geometry is non-planar with increasing convexity up-dip and increasing northwesterly dip-directions from north towards south, along strike. Non-planarity is also recorded from the morphological data along strike with the appearance of several, slip-parallel troughs and ridges with a mean distance (half-wavelength) of 0.75\u00a0m. The fault-plane roughness (absolute values) is scale dependent. The roughness configuration attains a slip-parallel pattern for observation scales above 1-cm.

Fault gouges in the shear zone are mainly composed of kaolinite, illite-mica, and illite-smectite and exhibit weak preferred orientation, ranging from 1.2 to 2.3\u00a0m.r.d. These fault cores are characterized by high localized strain and intense deformation due to cataclasis and frictional granular flow mechanisms, which produce transgranular fractures, rounded quartz grains, and an ultrafine clay matrix. In contrast, wall rocks show stronger clay preferred orientation, up to 3.9\u00a0m.r.d., despite having less clay content than the fault gouges. Much larger fault-related bent and sheared clay grains are present in the wall rocks, suggesting less severe deformation. The discrepancy between fault cores and wall rocks indicate that the development of fabrics is related to faulting and authigenic processes. Weak fabrics in the slip zone are attributed to the comminution of grains and neomineralization, allowing clay platelets to grow and rotate in many directions.

The structural and morphotectonic study carried out in the central-northern part of this half graben basin (north of Teruel city) has allowed us to analyse rift segmentation, deformation partitioning and rift evolution. Results are based on vertical displacement calculations (fault throw and bending) of the main border and intrabasin fault zones. We use two geomorfological-stratigraphical markers, the Intramiocene Erosion Surface (IES; 11.2\u00a0Ma) and the Fundamental Erosion Surface (FES; 3.5\u00a0Ma). While the first marker reveals rift initiation under an E-W extension, the late marker records vertical displacements associated to a second, Late Pliocene\u2013Quaternary rifting stage characterized by a nearly multidirectional extension regime with prevailing ENE-WSW trending \u00f33. Despite the along-axis rift segmentation into three structural domains (northern, central and southern) and the distribution of deformation among border and intrabasin faults in the central and southern domains, a consistent average slip rate (post-IES) of 0.09 mm\/a has been calculated on distinct transects across the basin, suggesting a homogeneous crustal-scale extension process in the region. The results also reveal that slip rates during the Late Pliocene-Quaternary (0.12\u20130.16 mm\/a) are higher than the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene (0.05\u20130.07 mm\/a). Slip rate increase is caused by (i) a westward propagation of deformation from the Valencia Through, and (ii) a change in the regional stress field, both enhanced by crustal doming affecting central-eastern Iberia, as well as progressive fault linkage. Throw vs. distance graphs suggest that the main faults are in a transient stage towards coalescence, less advanced within the southern domain. Regional Late Pliocene-Quaternary uplift, concomitant with increasing slip rates in the Teruel Basin rift, has caused the basin to rise, so that synrift sedimentation only took place in rapidly subsiding residual basins until the region became exorheic and the basin was incised by the present-day fluvial network.\n               ","250":"\n                  We present new fault slip data to decipher the tectonic stress regime in younger granites (2.61\u00a0Ga) of western Dharwar craton (WDC), south India.

Paleostress analysis using Right Dihedron and Rotational Optimization methods reveal that these faults have developed under NNE-SSW directed extension. Similar results are also obtained when left-lateral and right-lateral oblique-slip normal faults are treated as separate entities. It is envisaged that all faults in Chitradurga granite have developed under a single tectonic event and are considered to be extensional shear fractures. We interpret that the oblique-slip normal faults in granite oriented along NNW-SSE to N-S (P shear), NW-SE (R shear), NE-SW (R\u2032 shear), and WNW-ESE (T) are defined as the respective shear components of the regional riedel shear system. It developed due to sinistral movement along the Chitradurga Shear Zone (CSZ) during late D3 deformation at shallow crustal level. The fault planes act as primary or secondary shear planes, depending on their proximity to the CSZ and kinematically fit well with regional far-field compression.

The magnetite grains have very high aspect ratios (up to 10.40) that result in very high degree of magnetic anisotropy in the rock. We show low and high angle grain boundaries (LAGB and HAGB) in magnetite using a combination of electron backscatter diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis. HRTEM studies on lamellae excavated perpendicular to the LAGB and HAGB reveal translational and rotational Moir\u00e9 fringes, respectively. Dislocations, slip bands, stacking faults, twins and recrystallized domains are observed in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, thus providing unequivocal evidence of intracrystalline deformation of magnetite. Our study also reveals the presence of biotite inclusions intergrown epitaxially with magnetite that show no evidence of lattice defects, thus suggesting that the intracrystalline deformation of magnetite took place under wet conditions. The movement at the grain boundaries is interpreted as a response to regional tectonics with a top-to-NW transport direction. It is established that at the nanoscale, the LAGB and HAGB were favourably oriented to accommodate strain dominantly by translation and rotation, respectively.

It is known that the joint surface roughness is one of the critical parameters controlling the frictional behaviour of rock joints. While nominal normal and shear stresses acting across the joint asperities are calculated based on overall shearing area, the actual normal and shear stresses can be much greater due to smaller actual contact area. The actual contact area on the other hand is known to be related to the joint surface roughness. In order to investigate the effect of contact area on the shear behaviour of rock joints, an extensive set of direct shear experiments at different normal stresses on dry and saturated shale, limestone and sandstone tensile joints were undertaken. To compare the frictional properties of natural and artificial samples, synthetic samples were also fabricated, and their frictional properties were evaluated. Results of this study revealed that the predominant parameter controlling the frictional strength is the actual contact area. While the common models in predicting the shear strength of rock joints were unable to fit the experimental data based on nominal contact area, the results based on actual contact area fit the measured values accurately. In addition, it was observed that when the actual contact area is considered, Mohr-Coulomb criterion is sufficient to fit the experimental data irrespective of the rock type, joint surface roughness or whether dry or saturated. This highlights that the Mohr-Coulomb criterion can appropriately predict the frictional strength if the actual contact area can be estimated. More importantly, the results showed that the surface roughness cannot dictate the shear behaviour of rock joints without considering the actual contact area.\n               ","253":"\n                  A quantitative assessment of how faults control the migration of geofluids is critical in many areas of geosciences.

The analyses revealed a train of tight concentric folds that increase in stage development towards the escarpment in the Dammam Formation. The shallower Kuwait Formation shows early stages of fault propagation folding as a result of the Kuwait Arch uplift towards the south of the escarpment. We suggest that friction along the Dammam Formation upper contact detachment planes increased towards the south, thus promoting the propagation of the fold reaching the surface, resulting in the Jal Az-Zor escarpment that we see today.

In this framework, the compressive component of the transpressional geodynamic regime can produce the high topographic elevation of the High Atlas belt without crustal thickening.\n               ","258":"\n                  The Mountain Front Flexure is a major structure of the Zagros orogenic system, and is underlain by the deeply rooted and seismically active Mountain Front Fault system. These coupled structural features divide the belt from its foreland and their trace is sinuous, forming salients and recesses. The origin and tectonic significance of the Mountain Front Fault system and its sinuosity are still unclear, with most of hypotheses pointing to a strong structural control exerted by geological inheritances. In this work we combine interpretation of seismic reflection profiles, earthquake data, geomorphic analysis, and geological observations, to build a balanced cross section across the Mountain Front Flexure in the Lurestan region. Our data are suggestive of a hybrid tectonic style for the Lurestan region, characterised by a major and newly developed crustal ramp in the frontal portion of the belt (i.e the Mountain Front Fault) and by the reactivation of steeply dipping pre-existing basin-bounding faults, along with a minor amount of shortening, in the inner area. Specifically, the integration of our results with previous knowledge indicates that the Mountain Front Fault system developed ahead of an array of inverted Jurassic extensional faults, in a structural fashion which resembles that of a crustal-scale footwall shortcut. Within this structural context, the sinusoidal shape of the Mountain Front Flexure in the Lurestan area arises from the re-use of the original segmentation of the inverted Jurassic rift system.\n               ","259":"\n                  We performed structural analyses on exhumed fault planes in carbonate rock of the Monte Vettore fault system (Central Italian Apennines). Slip on these faults was responsible in 2016 for a Mw 6.6 earthquake, accompanied by 30-km-long surface rupture. We focused on scratches, a peculiar coseismic abrasion feature that is rarely described and analysed in structural geology, mainly because of its ephemeral nature (most of scratches disappear after just a few months). We surveyed coseismic scratches and slip vectors of coseismic surface ruptures that, coupled with conventional striae analysis, provide interesting clues to the kinematic behavior of the hanging-wall during the 2016 mainshock. First, we investigated whether or not scratches could be considered as kinematic indicators and if they could really add information to results of striae analysis. To this end, we compared the statistical analysis of scratches with those obtained from conventional fault-surface structural elements or inferred from other geological, seismological and geodetical data. Results show that the movement of the hanging-wall of the Monte Vettore fault system during the October 30, 2016, mainshock can be traced back to two components. The first, major component is kinematically linked to deep tectonic deformation. The second, minor component, is related to passive-slip deformation induced by the complexity of reciprocal motion between hanging-wall and footwall.\n               ","260":"","261":"\n                  A vast CO2 storage resource exists offshore in Cretaceous through Neogene sandstone in the DeSoto Canyon Salt Basin in the east-central Gulf of Mexico continental shelf. Understanding the structural styles, the likelihood of reactivation, and seal properties of the faults in this area is essential for selecting safe carbon storage sites and minimizing the risk of injected CO2 migrating beyond the confines of the storage complex. The DeSoto Canyon Salt Basin has variable structural styles in the basin with different insights for CO2 storage. The Mobile-Viosca Knoll shelf contains stable shelf and a large four-way structural closure, where provide favorable storage opportunities. The Destin Dome region contains three groups of peripheral faults of the Destin Fault System. Faults that strike along SHmax dip at 60\u00b0, and steeply dipping faults are predicted to have elevated risk of slip and dilation. The W-E striking fault group has an overall higher slip and dilation tendency than the other two groups under the same injection conditions. Fault seal analysis shows that elevated risk along faults occurs at sandstone-sandstone juxtaposition zones and zones with high fault throw and low SGR values. Storage plans should avoid the faults with elevated risk to ensure that the injectate will not flow into or pressurize the fault zones. Ideal injection sites within the Destin Fault System in the Destin Dome region are in hanging wall rollovers that contain low fault throw and shale-sandstone juxtapositions. Future research should focus on geomechanical, pressure, and flow simulation of the potential reservoirs and associated seals in the area of the peripheral faults.\n               ","262":"\n                  Analyses of three oriented rock samples collected in the footwall of a major normal fault in Central Italy provide insights into textural properties of a lithified carbonate fault core.

X-ray powder diffraction analysis shows that the samples, which are located at a mutual distance of few tens of meters, are exclusively made of calcite. Mesoscopic samples and polished thin sections oriented normal to the fault plane have been analysed with high resolution scanner (HRS), transmission optical microscopy (TOM) and scanning electron microscopy in back-scattered mode (BS-SEM).

The obtained D values have average values of 1.65 in 2D, overlapping with those independently obtained by box-counting methods in the core of the same fault by previous authors. Textures of calcite clasts in tectonised and lithified rocks can be appropriately quantified by the analytical protocols proposed here. This work represents the first multi-scale image analysis, from sub- \u03bcm to cm sizes, of the core portion of a normal fault that cut into carbonate rocks.

Simple models suggest that extension forms at the upslope (head) area, contraction is focussed in the downslope toe of the slump, while differential shear associated with strike-slip is restricted to the lateral margins of the slump. Although the head and toe are considered to be dominated by layer-parallel shear (LPS), differential layer-normal shear (LNS) may be generated around the lateral margins of slumps and potentially also within MTDs where flow has been separated into different \u2018lobes\u2019. Despite this realisation that LNS must form, there has been little work into the geometries and spatial relationships of resulting structures. Using the late Pleistocene Lisan Formation exposed around the Dead Sea Basin as our case study, we examine detailed (<10\u00a0m) relationships of folds and thrusts created during LNS and LPS, as well as investigating the role of broadly coeval extension that may reactivate these structures. We also undertake analysis of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) fabrics to determine flow and shear relationships around folds and detachments created during LNS and LPS. Our study shows that LPS results in gently-curvilinear fold hinges that arc around the transport direction while LNS results in cylindrical fold hinges developed oblique or sub-parallel to transport. Such folds may be recumbent or upright, and associated with lateral ramps marking areas of differential LNS within the MTD. These structures are interpreted to accommodate variations in the amount and direction of downslope-directed movement resulting in LNS around the margins of individual flow \u2018lobes\u2019 that are developed over tens of metres. These \u2018lobes\u2019 display broadly down-slope transport with locally radial flow that results in along-strike shortening between lobes. Our analysis of AMS fabrics shows that they are controlled by slump folds, but magnetic fabrics do not differentiate how these folds were created in zones of LPS or differential LNS. AMS taken from gouge formed along detachments marked by differential LNS provide a first-order indicator for the transport direction. In addition, AMS fabrics in gouge or fluidised layers directly beneath thrust ramps, reveals prolate fabrics marking a component of strike-parallel flow along the branching intersections of thrust ramps and flats. Extensional faults directly reactivate existing thrusts, or create new extensional faults that are sub-parallel to thrusts or cut across them at steeper angles. Extension is part of the same MTD event as a sedimentary cap that is deposited out of suspension following slope failure, overlies and locally thickens into the hangingwall of extensional faults to create \u2018growth\u2019 sequences. Extensional reactivation and \u2018collapse\u2019 of original thrusts may help explain why contraction is apparently \u2018missing\u2019 from many seismic sections across MTDs.\n               ","264":"\n                  Fold and thrust belts (FTBs) accommodate tectonic convergence through folding and faulting of crustal rocks during a collisional event between two continental plates. Although evidence of distributed deformation is common in FTBs that usually leads to continuous foliations and regionally occurring ductile structures of multiple orders, it has rarely been given much attention assuming that zones of localized deformation, like shear zones and brittle faults, accommodate the entire amount of tectonic convergence. This study presents 3D laboratory-scale models, using viscous thin sheet as crustal layers, to understand the evolution of ductile strain in a tectonic wedge. We varied the degree of mechanical coupling at the basal decollement (i.e., weak versus strong) to investigate this issue at constant convergence velocity in all experiments to avoid the influence of rate-dependence on viscous rheology. Our results reveal that the strength of basal decollement controls the mode of wedge growth and hence, the strain pattern particularly towards the hinterland. The weak decollement models yield a zone of constriction towards the central part of hinterland, explaining the occurrence of isolated patches of L-tectonites and cross-folds in FTBs; while the strong decollement condition allows gravity driven flow to be active in the hinterland, leading to orogen-parallel recumbent folds. In contrast, both weak and strong decollement models produce deformation that characterises the commonness of pervasive, hinterland dipping ductile fabrics towards the mountain front. We correlate our findings to show that spatio-temporal variations in basal coupling are responsible for varying occurrence of ductile structures in FTBs.\n               ","265":"\n                  The Cap de Creus peninsula in NE Spain exposes Variscan amphibolite-facies rocks, transected by greenschist-facies mylonitic shear zones accommodating displacements of up to 1\u00a0km. One of these shear zones contains pseudotachylytes with 1\u20134\u00a0mm thick fault veins and cm-scale high-angle injection veins and breccias. The pseudotachylyte matrix encloses mm-to \u03bcm-scale wallrock fragments and consists of ultrafine biotite and feldspar, often with a microporphyritic structure suggesting crystallization from a melt. Recent dating of the host shear zone yielded a Jurassic (170-160\u00a0Ma) age.

Opening-mode extension fractures (veins) at high angles to bedding dominate the fracture population, although shear fractures and faults cut bedding at low angles within the forelimb. Analysis of extension fractures reveals NW-striking axial parallel and NE-striking axial-perpendicular fracture sets interpreted to have formed during contractional folding, a third N-striking fracture set formed during subsequent Basin and Range extension, and a fourth ESE-striking fracture formed due to unloading during exhumation. Fracture fill textures suggest that many fracture apertures increased during exhumation.\n                  The relative abundances of the four fracture sets and the intensity of each set vary from bed to bed in cross section. Because beds display no significant differences in mechanical strength and there is no correlation between bed thickness and fracture intensity, we attribute this bed-to-bed variability to differences in cohesion between beds. Bed decoupling, when combined with low extensional (<0.5%) strains, helps explain low vertical persistence. We hypothesize that weak bed cohesion results in variability of fracture patterns within planar fold limbs. In fold limbs with low fracture-related strains, we propose that high angles between fracture sets increases the likelihood of high bed-parallel fracture connectivity, and low fracture vertical persistence results in low vertical connectivity.\n               ","267":"\n                  Compression of a region containing multiple detachment layers produces large-scale disharmonic folding, where individual competent units separated by detachment fold independently within the succession.

Interpretation of seismic sections and the construction of corresponding balanced cross-sections reveals different geometries along the folds and the complete decoupling of these structures from the surface geology.

Detachment folding with limb rotation started in the Middle Miocene and continued with the migration of the basal detachment horizon (equivalent Hormuz series) into the core of the anticlines. Flow of both the basal and upper detachments continued until no more material is available, whereupon the shortening is accommodated by fault development. The development of a decoupled, disharmonic folding style was controlled by the upper detachment surface through migration from the crests of the anticlines to the synclinal areas and by the reactivation of the basement faults.

The focus is on the micro-fractures that cut the flaky-mineral rich cleavage (c-) and the porphyroclast-rich microlithon (m-) domains of the disjunctive foliation planes. Although the rock appears unsheared mesoscopically, in the micro-scale S\u2013C fabric, shadow zones and tails of few quartz porphyroclasts exhibit a top-to-SW ductile shear. A mean kinematic vorticity number (Wm) of ~0.73 has already been determined from this rock. Our renewed study of thin-sections reveal fracture refraction patterns that match with the findings of various known analogue- and analytical models, viz., (i) higher competency contrast between c- and m-domains favours extension fractures over shear fractures, which develop more in the m-domains. Shear fractures dominate in the c-domains, (ii) the angle (\u03f4) between fracture and the \u2018layer normal\u2019 is higher (>70\u00b0) inside the less-competent layers, (iii) a dominant simple shear in the brittle regime produces the P-planes at an angle to the primary shear Y-plane. In one such case, \u03f4 measured from thin-section for 15 successive sub-parallel c-and m-domains show that the most viscous m-domain is ~24 times more viscous than the lowest viscous c-domain. Additionally, out of the eight c-layers, the most viscous c-domain is 3.4 times more viscous than the least viscous c-domain. Similarly, out of the seven m-domains, the most viscous m-domain has a viscosity four times more than the least viscous m-domain. Knowing viscosity ratio of different layers in rocks will enable better analogue and analytical tectonic models. Our numerical models of general shear on linear elastic materials similar to the studied rock type, however, show that the rheological contrast does not influence the curvature of the shear-induced fractures at the boundaries between the quartz-rich sandstone and the mica-rich domains.

Deconvolving these phenomena requires multi-scale hematite textural characterization and constraints on the ambient thermal history from conventional thermochronometry. Two examples of this approach include investigations of hematite-coated fault surfaces from exhumed damage zones in the seismically active Wasatch fault zone (WFZ), UT, and Painted Canyon fault (PCF) paralleling the southern San Andreas fault, Mecca Hills, CA. WFZ fault mirrors preserve sub-\u03bcm-scale polygonal grain textures and hematite He data patterns that, together with host-rock apatite He data, are consistent with localized friction-generated heat, hematite He loss, and hematite recrystallization during damage zone seismicity <4.5\u00a0Ma.

The results show that throw-rates increase within linkage zones and propagating fault bends independently from the stage of maturity of the fault bend. This implies that 1) the relationship between the local fault geometry and the along-strike distribution of throw-rate is driven by the deeper part of the fault, where established fault bends start propagating to the surface; 2) faults grow first by linkage and coalescence of separate faults, and then by accumulation of slip on the resultant fault, in agreement with models of fault growth by linkage and coalescence; 3) incipient fault bends can produce uncertainty associated with palaeoseismological results, if fault bends remain unrecognised.

The first extensional faulting event within the limestone formed localized faults with a single fault core surrounded by a damage zone. The fault rock was either dolomitized as deformation proceeded or resealed by calcite cement after brecciation. The dolomitized fault rocks were reactivated during the following strike-slip faulting, forming polyphase breccias. On the other hand, strain was distributed in dolostones throughout a wider area during the extensional faulting forming a pulverized fault zone. The pulverized rock experienced cataclastic deformation during the following strike-slip faulting forming anastomosing networks of cataclastic shear bands. Fault cores hosted in the limestone appear to have acted as flow conduits until they were cemented or hardened due to evolving cataclasis. The cataclastic shear bands in the dolostone are likely to form baffles to flow, at least on a local scale. The fracture spacing in the damage zone also varies significantly between the lithologies.

These techniques enable mineral shape distribution maps to be produced, thereby allowing the nature and relative percentage of the weakening vs. hardening layers, as well as their kinematics, to be obtained within a statistically meaningful dataset. Selected rock-types are derived from shearing associated with the meso-Alpine strike-slip tectonics of the western Mediterranean realm, which since the Paleocene has involved, skarn, migmatitic paragneiss and tonalites. These rocks belong to a deep-seated portion of the original southern European Variscan chain known as the Calabrian Pelortani Orogen. Microstructural maps reveal porphyroclastic domains, represented alternatively by feldspar, amphibole, pyroxene or scapolite, that can be distinguished from weakening phase areas, characterised by quartz, biotite plus quartz, or alternatively by calcite when the weakening layer is controlled predominantly by skarns. Image elaboration of porphyroclastic domains was employed to estimate the dominant shear-type, with Rigid Grain Analysis, indicating a pure shear component of 66\u201368% for the mylonitic tonalites; 62\u201366% for the mylonitic paragneisses; and 58\u201362% for the mylonitic skarn.

As in previous models, lateral movement of rigid basal plates induced strike-slip deformation of a sand-pack. Local extension allowing the formation of a pull-apart basin was produced by the step-over geometry of the master faults; in this area, a basal silicone layer was introduced to distribute deformation and reproduced a weaker crust in the basin. Conditions of neutral, overlapping and underlapping interacting master faults were reproduced. The model upper crust, modelled by a sand mixture, was characterised by the presence of pre-existing structures; the orientation of these inherited heterogeneities was systematically varied in different experiments. Model results indicate that, depending on their orientation with respect to the strike-slip displacement, pre-existing structures can be reactivated both within and at the margins of the pull-apart basins. Inside the basin, reactivation occurs when the pre-existing structures are orthogonal or sub-orthogonal to the strike-slip displacement; in this case, the pre-existing fabrics delay the development and linkage of cross-basin faults and increase the complexity of the deformation pattern giving rise to a new set of faults characterised by an atypical trend. Pre-existing fabrics oblique to the local extension direction may be partly reactivated in the central part of the basin as segments of cross-basin faults. At the margins of the pull-apart, reactivation occurs if the fabrics spatially coincide with the lateral boundaries of the silicone layer. In these conditions, reactivation allows a faster development of the border faults, which are less segmented than in the homogenous models; this also results in a more regular final geometry of the pull-apart.\n               ","280":"\n                  Intensely fractured rock volumes characterize fault damage zones in cohesive rocks and typically developed from multiple deformation stages associated with fault propagation and linkage.

In this paper, we report on results from a study performed to characterize the fracture pattern in thick sandstone strata in the footwall of the Compione active extensional fault zone. Fracture network attributes were studied in cross-sectional vertical exposures by the window sampling method, which allows to describe fracture topology, intensity, frequency, and orientations. Our data indicate that fracture network topology in the damage zone is dominated by Y- and X-nodes (Y>55% and 20%\u00a0<\u00a0X<35% of nodes) and by C\u2013C branches (>85% of branches) in 5 out of 6 structural sectors going away from the fault core. Fractures are mainly composed by passively rotated and sheared, early conjugate subsidiary extensional faults, overprinted by late high-angle conjugate extensional faults, with fracture intensity logarithmically increasing towards the fault core.

Vettore. This fault system produced clear and impressive co-seismic ruptures on normal faults in the hangingwall of the M. Sibillini thrust, whereas ruptures in the footwall were observed, but less clear. As a result, a strong controversy exists in the literature about the geometry of the seismogenic faults, their relationships with pre-existing thrusts, and the location of normal-faulting rupture tips. In this work, we present a 3D geological model of the M. Vettore area located between the Castelluccio basin and the outcrop of the M. Sibillini thrust, where the most evident co-seismic ruptures have been observed. The model shows the relationship between the ruptured normal faults and the M. Sibillini thrust, and was constructed using a grid of 14 geological cross-sections parallel and orthogonal to the main structural elements (i.e. normal faults and thrusts) down to a depth of 3\u00a0km. The model was built using reference structural surfaces, such as the top of the Early Cretaceous Maiolica Fm., the M. Sibillini thrust and the main seismogenic normal faults belonging to the M. Vettore fault system. The 3D model has allowed us to calculate the vertical cumulative throw distribution for the M. Vettore normal faults. The cumulative geological throw of ca. 1300 m across the normal faults in the proximity of the M. Sibillini thrust indicates that the seismogenic fault system continues into the footwall of the thrust, displacing it in the sub-surface. The results of this study provide important constraints on the cross-cutting relationships between active normal and pre-existing compressional structures in seismically active areas, contributing to a better definition of the faults segmentation, and the related seismic hazard.\n               ","282":"\n                  A detailed study of the structure of the Pen\u00ednsula Mitre recess in the Fuegian thrust-fold belt of southern Argentina reveals superposed deformation related to contrasting shortening directions.

A second group of structures accommodate contraction superposed on the previous group. Analysis of fault-slip data reveals that the first group is related to \u03c31 perpendicular to the surface traces of thrusts and\/or fold axes, and are therefore compressive structures. In contrast, the paleostress tensors of the second group of structures show \u03c31 orientations parallel or at a low angle with respect to local structural trends. The style of the superposed structures of the second group, which mostly indicate contraction subparallel to the trend of the recess, is consistent with structures resulting from tangential longitudinal shortening associated with oroclinal bending. This scenario implies that the Peninsula Mitre recess formed as a progressive curve involving rotation due to slip trajectories convergent toward the recess, causing the observed tangential contraction.

Here, we investigate the effect of far-field tectonic stresses on the central peak uplift based on interpretation of new high-resolution P-Cable and conventional seismic reflection data. Nearby wells provided stratigraphic control on the interpreted horizons. The reconstruction of the crater sedimentary infill supports a subdued original central peak relief with a 5\u00a0km-wide, gentle mound ~15\u00a0m below the rim. Our interpretation shows that subvertical, outward-dipping, impact-induced faults were reactivated by uplifted segments of the central peak up to 500\u00a0m above the platform level during one or several contractional episodes. We postulate that post-Albian tectonic compressional events triggered the structural uplift of the Mj\u00f8lnir central peak. Differential compaction, previously seen as the main deformation process, may have increased the original central peak height by only ~10\u00a0m.

While BPS is intuitively thought to operate during downslope sliding of mass transport deposits (MTDs) in sedimentary basins, there is a conspicuous lack of supporting outcrop or seismic data to corroborate this and BPS displacement may therefore have remained unaccounted for. This study addresses this gap in knowledge by investigating late-Pleistocene MTDs developed around the Dead Sea Basin and provides the first detailed analysis of BPS that pervades a gravity-driven setting. In particular, we examine the role of BPS that crosscuts earlier normal and reverse faults that act as markers to allow metre-scale patterns of horizontal displacement to be identified in MTDs. The studied BPS always forms with a consistent top-to-the east sense of offset that corresponds with gravity-driven downslope movement towards the depo-centre of the basin. BPS frequently develops adjacent to competent detrital-rich beds and forms discrete glide planes with little or no visible deformation in sediments on either margin, although detachment folds are occasionally developed above the slip plane and confirm directions of easterly movement. Early downslope-dipping normal faults that are cut by later BPS planes results in older over younger stratigraphic relationships across the BPS surface, together with \u2018sawtooth\u2019 patterns where multiple BPS planes have developed. Conversely, early upslope-dipping normal faults that are cut by BPS create younger over older stratigraphic relationships combined with missing section and \u2018staircase\u2019 patterns where multiple BPS planes exist. As BPS in sub-horizontal sequences does not have a vertical component of displacement, it may be examined in terms of horizontal \u2018heave\u2019. BPS increases heave in upslope-dipping normal faults, whereas it reduces heave in downslope-dipping normal faults and may even become negative where sections are repeated across sawtooth profiles. In addition, BPS increases heave in upslope-dipping reverse\/thrust faults and reduces heave across downslope dipping \u2018backthrusts\u2019. Although individual BPS planes may have limited displacement, the net consequence of multiple planes of BPS that form in the shallow-subsurface is to distort patterns and estimates of extension and contraction across fault zones in MTDs.\n               ","286":"\n                  Understanding the evolution of thrust-related folds requires knowledge of their structural deformation over time and space, which is important for analyzing subsurface structures, hydrocarbon traps, and seismotectonic models. Here, we use high-quality 3-D seismic data interpretation and modeling to construct the subsurface structure of the Sumatou anticline in the Sichuan Basin, China. We focus on the effects of structural styles and fault displacement-distance relationships on along-strike variations in the fold deformation mechanism. Seismic interpretation reveals the along-strike variation in structural styles that formed by slip on a northwest dipping thrust fault. The fault displacement-distance profiles reveal that this structure generally follows a linear decreasing relationship, which is consistent with the pattern of fault-propagation folds (FPF). The northern segment illustrates a planar thrust ramp and self-similar growth characteristics. In contrast, the central and south segments exhibit a distinct structural style of fault-bend folding that maintains the linear decreasing trend of fault displacement-distance relationships, which is inconsistent with fault-bend folds model (FBF) prediction. We simulate three possible fault-bending and propagating kinematic models to verify the fault displacement-distance profiles. The simulations reveal that the Sumatou anticline transitioned from early stage FPF to FBF during lateral growth. We suggest that this transition may exist in a variety of tectonic settings, such as the Sichuan Basin, the Nankai Trough, and the Niger Delta, which can be revealed by analyses of fault displacement-distance profiles and structural style variability.\n               ","287":"\n                  A new type of fault relay zone in extensional contexts, dominated by distributed along-strike or longitudinal fractures, is defined. It contrasts with the classical models reported in the literature, in which transverse connecting faults controlled by the own relay kinematics prevail. The new model is based on structural features of the Teruel graben system, as well as on analogue modelling. Relay zones between the NW-SE to NNW-SSE striking faults that delimit the eastern boundary of the Jiloca Graben (Calamocha, Sierra Palomera and Concud faults), together with the Teruel Fault, have been studied. All of these relay faults show recent (Neogene-Quaternary) ruptures at different scales, mostly parallel to the macrostructural trend and to the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) trajectories (i.e., orthogonal to the ENE-WSW regional extension direction that characterises the nearly biaxial or radial stress regime active during Upper Pliocene-Quaternary times). Transverse ruptures are almost absent, with the exception of the northern relay zone (Calamocha-Sierra Palomera), where an incipient NE-SW striking connecting fault does exist. Analogue models have been run under a biaxial extension regime similar to the regional one. They allowed analysing the main factors controlling fracture propagation, depending on the ratio of extension velocities and the orientation of the master faults relative to extension directions. Laboratory fracture patterns, as in the natural studied examples, are mostly controlled by the inherited anisotropies and, in a greater extent, by the imposed extension trajectories, which results in a clear prevalence of longitudinal fractures. Such external controls, usually disregarded in numerical and analogue modelling, tend to induce fault coalescence through along-strike (parallel or at very-low-angle) propagation resulting in a final braided fault pattern.\n               ","288":"\n                  It is common for the fractured zone around dynamic faults to contain tensile cracks.

In addition, the effect of rupture speed (c), friction coefficient (f), fault inclination angle (\u03b2) and confining stress (Ko) were taken into account. The MSED-Criterion permits the study of the creation of tensile cracks in brittle and ductile shear zones. It was found that by increasing Poisson's ratio, the rock behavior transfers gradually from brittle to ductile and as a consequence, the branching angle and fracture toughness increase. Whenever the rock mass tends towards ductile behavior, the possibility of creating tensile branches decreases. Ductile shear zones can sustain stresses greater than brittle zones before tensile branches are formed around dynamic faults. The branching angle of tensile cracks is directly proportional to (\u03bd, c, \u03b2, f and Ko) and it varies between approximately 77\u00b0 and 115\u00b0. These cracks are formed in the extensional side of a dynamic fault and they tend to grow towards the maximum far-field stress.

Two differ in the basic grid geometry and the arrangement of mechanically weak fault zone elements, respectively. The third uses a discontinuous grid and contact elements to represent the fault.

This work illustrates the integration of cartographic, tectonic, geomorphological, paleoseismological and geophysical methods for the characterization of the slow-moving extensional Daroca Fault, related to the negative inversion of the Alpine Daroca Thrust, Iberian Chain, NE Spain. Cartographic data indicate that the 27\u00a0km long Daroca Fault and the 17\u00a0km long Calamocha Fault, separated by a stepover 1.9\u00a0km wide, can be considered as segments of the same structure that might rupture jointly and generate Mw7 earthquakes.

The work discusses why this slip rate is significantly lower than those estimated in nearby normal faults using OSL ages (Optically Stimulated Luminiscence), but comparable with those derived from offset early Pliocene limestones.

We find that the magnitude of the post last-glacial maximum throw across the fault varies along strike. If such variations are unnoticed, different values for a representative strain-rate, hence different results in seismic hazard calculations, would be produced. To demonstrate this, we progressively degrade our dataset, calculating the implied strain-rate at each step. Excluding measurements can alter strain-rate results beyond 1\u03c3 uncertainty, thus we urge caution when using only one measurement of slip-rate for calculating hazard. We investigate the effect of approximating the throw profile along the fault with boxcar and triangular distributions and show that this can underestimate or overestimate the strain-rate, with results in the range of 72\u2013237% of our most detailed strain-rate calculation.

In addition, seismic events with high similarity of seismic waveforms were grouped into clusters and interpreted to have originated from slip of patches of a common fault or fault zone. In this study we investigate the orientations of fault patches from seismic clusters, considering relative location errors of cluster events with Monte-Carlo simulations, and use common events in clusters ranging in size from few 10s to many 100s of metres to explore the internal architecture of larger fault zones at Basel.

The values measuring connectivity for the GSB and SEA polygonal fault sets plot in ternary diagrams in similar areas to other complex normal fault sets from rifts. These data sets are dominated by faults with either isolated fault tips (I nodes) or with abutting or splaying geometries (Y nodes). The similarities in node and branch topology of polygonal faults, and complex fault patterns in rifts (associated with multi-phase rifting, complex local stress rotations, or inherited fabrics), which are imaged on 3D seismic, indicates that topology describes the complexity of fault connectivity, but in general, by itself, cannot discriminate the causes of normal fault pattern variations. The Al Farafra Oasis faults sets (areas 2 and 3) provide an end member example of fault patterns with a very high degree of connectivity associated with cross-cutting fault sets (X-nodes) that are more rarely present in other fault sets. Some faults forming X-nodes may be hybrid tensile-shear failure fractures, or even calcite vein-filled tensile fractures.

Across south Texas, the Cretaceous section experienced widespread extensional deformation (faulting and fracturing) during Cenozoic extension southeastward toward the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Foley, 1926; Weeks, 1945; Ferrill and Morris, 2008; Treadgold et al., 2010). In addition, the western portion of this region exhibits uplift and folding associated with Laramide tectonism (Rose, 1984; Scott, 2010; Ewing, 2016). In this study, we analyze outcrops of the Boquillas Formation where it outcrops in west Texas, to characterize deformation styles near the frontal limit of macroscale Laramide contractional deformation.\nThe focus of this study is a series of roadcut exposures along Highway 90, northwest of Del Rio, Texas (Fig. 1\n). Fold trains in the Boquillas Formation are exposed over a highway distance of 2.5\u00a0km, where more than 100 open to tight anticlines are observed on both sides of the highway. The outcrops have for decades been popular field trip stops as part of geological society meetings and student field trips (e.g., Southern Association of Student Geological Societies, 1990; Willett, 1990; Lock et al., 2010), and featured in or subject of published articles (Johnston, 1983; Lock et al., 2001). These folds have been typically referred to as \u2018tepee structures\u2019, and variously interpreted as synsedimentary features hypothesized to have been active during Cretaceous deposition (Johnston, 1983), or the result of Quaternary caliche (Lock et al., 2001; Lock, 2010). Interestingly, none of the published works appear to have given serious consideration to the possibility of the structures having a contractional tectonic origin. Both macro- and meso-scale tectonic folds (Fig. 1) have been documented in Cretaceous strata in the Devils River Uplift (represented by basement and Paleozoic strata uplifted during the Paleozoic Ouachita orogeny and again during the Laramide orogeny after Cretaceous sedimentation; Flawn et al., 1961; Nicholas and Rozendal, 1975; Webster, 1980; Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Webster and Calhoun, 1984) and in the Boquillas Formation in other parts of west Texas (e.g., Ferrill et al., 2016, 2022). The structural style of these folds is reminiscent of tectonic mesoscale folds in carbonate and clastic rocks within contractional regimes globally (e.g., Currie et al., 1962; Groshong, 1975a, 1975b; Ferrill and Dunne, 1989; Dahlstrom, 1990; Hogan and Dunne, 2001; Boyer and Mitra, 2019).\nIn this paper, we explore these mesostructures in detail, characterizing fold orientations, performing local structural interpretations and restorations, and analyzing veins associated with the folds using fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analyses. Based on results of these investigations, we conclude that the folds are tectonic in origin and formed under considerable overburden, consistent with the regionally recognized Laramide shortening in the region (Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Webster and Calhoun, 1984).\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe study area consists of outcrops of the Boquillas Formation within the Devils River Uplift of west Texas (Fig. 1). The Boquillas Formation, and laterally equivalent Eagle Ford Formation east of the Devils River, were deposited in the Late Cretaceous between about 98 and 90\u00a0Ma (Minisini et al., 2018) during a tectonically quiet period in the region. The Boquillas-Eagle Ford section thickens laterally into the Maverick Basin, which is centered approximately 150\u00a0km southeast of the present study area (Donovan et al., 2012; Breyer et al., 2016; Rose, 2016). The basal Boquillas Formation in the area has abundant limestone beds with hydrodynamic features indicating bottom currents and influence of storm waves, as well as finely laminated mudrock and volcanic ash beds, indicating lower energy conditions (Lock and Peschier, 2006; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). Increasing water depth during deposition resulted in an extensive section representing pelagic sedimentation below storm wave base, with deposits dominated by organic-rich mudrock separated by periodic chalk beds, as well as thin volcanic ash beds (Breyer, 2016; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). After this prolonged period of pelagic sedimentation, gradual shallowing of water depths led to a return to higher energy conditions on the seafloor and deposition of the upper Boquillas Formation, represented by thicker chalk beds, limestone beds, and hydrodynamic structures indicating marine currents and wave influence on deposition (Lehrmann et al., 2019).\nThe Devils River Uplift along the southern edge of the Val Verde Basin is a long-lived tectonic feature (Ewing, 1985). At depth, the uplift is represented by thrust- or reverse-faulted Paleozoic strata emplaced during the Ouachita orogeny along with underlying Precambrian meta-igneous rocks (Flawn et al., 1961; Nicholas and Rozendal, 1975; Webster, 1980; Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Nicholas, 1983). Subsequently eroded between the Permian and Cretaceous, the Devils River Uplift and adjacent Val Verde basin to the north were then buried by unconformable Cretaceous strata. The Devils River Uplift experienced minor additional uplift during the Laramide orogeny, which produced contractional anticlines and synclines, monoclinal flexures, and some contractional faulting (Webster, 1980; Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Webster and Calhoun, 1984). These contractional structures occur along the margins of the Devils River Uplift as well as within the uplift and beyond its perimeter. Based on mapping deformation in the Cretaceous strata around the margins of the Devils River Uplift, Calhoun and Webster (1983) interpreted that this deformation could \u201cbest be explained by a compressive stress regime with the primary compressive stress direction oriented about N40\u00b0E\u201d.\nWest of the Devils River Uplift, contractional folds deforming Cretaceous strata are mapped in and around the Sierra del Carmen and westward across Big Bend National Park (Moustafa, 1988; Erdlac, 1990; Turner et al., 2011; Surpless et al., 2015; Ferrill et al., 2016; Surpless and Wigginton, 2020). These structures are generally consistent with NE-directed shortening associated with Laramide-age deformation, which is interpreted to have occurred from Late Cretaceous to Eocene in this region (\u223c80\u201340\u00a0Ma; Lehman, 1991; Goldhammer and Johnson, 1991). South of the Devils River Uplift in the Sabinas Basin of northeast Mexico, contractional folds are mapped in Cretaceous strata with dominant fold trends ranging from NW-SE to E-W indicative of NE-SW to N\u2013S directed shortening (Humphrey, 1956). Southeast of the Devils River Uplift, the SE-plunging Chittim anticline lies between the Rio Grande syncline (Fowler, 1956) or Eagle syncline (Rose, 1984) to the southwest near the Rio Grande, and the Zavala syncline to the northeast (Fig. 1). Formation of these folds, which all deform Cretaceous strata, is consistent with formation in response to NE-SW-directed Laramide shortening (Rose, 1984; Scott, 2010; Ewing, 2016).\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nStructural characterization: folds, veins, faults, and fractures\nStructural geologic characterization was performed on three pairs of NNE-SSW trending road cut exposures of the Boquillas Formation within the Devils River Uplift of west Texas. Initial structural observations from the exposures identified folds, extension fractures, and faults. Although stylolites (compactional and tectonic) have been observed in the region (most commonly in the underlying Buda Formation), none were observed in these exposures.\nDeformation in the exposures is dominated by folding, where more than 100 anticlines are present, typically separated by broad flat-bottomed synclines. Fold characterization involved measuring representative bedding orientations in equivalent beds on opposing limbs of each anticline. From these measurements, fold axes, fold interlimb angles, and axial surface orientations were determined using standard stereographic techniques (Ramsay, 1967; Ragan, 1973; Ramsay and Huber, 1987).\nFracture characterization in the outcrops focused on measuring fracture orientations and evaluating failure mode and sense of motion. This was done to provide context for selection of vein samples representative of (i) different orientation (high angle to bedding versus bed-parallel) or failure mode (tensile versus shear) sets, and (ii) different vein and fold relationships in the exposures. Calcite cemented opening mode extension fractures (veins) are most common in the exposures, but reverse and normal faults with vein cement are also present as noted above.\n\n\n3.2\nCross-section construction and restoration\nSeveral structures in the exposures were selected as examples to analyze in greater detail and mapped on digital photographs or photogrammetric models. Using Move 2019.1\u2122 (Petroleum Experts), these interpretations were projected onto a plane oriented perpendicular to fold axes. Two fold structures were analyzed by preparing fold-axis perpendicular cross sections interpreted from outcrop photographs. In both of these structures, bed-perpendicular calcite veins have been offset by bedding-plane flexural slip. Sense of shear and displacement magnitude of marker calcite veins were used as inputs for kinematic restoration and forward modeling of fold structures.\nIn addition to the cross-section analysis of these two folds, close-range oblique aerial photographs of the site were collected with a Phantom 4 Pro unmanned aerial vehicle with onboard 20 megapixel camera. Aerial images were used to generate a photogrammetric point-cloud and textured mesh reconstruction of the western roadcut of the northern pair of the exposures, and georeferencing of digital data was carried out using real-time kinematic differential global positional system (RTKDGPS) ground control points. Digital mapping of bedding horizons and fold geometries was performed using the photogrammetric model of the outcrop. Digital interpretations were then projected to a cross section perpendicular to the average fold axis orientation, and kinematic restoration of projected polyline interpretations (using Move 2019.1\u2122) was performed (i) over the entire western roadcut of the northern pair of the exposures, (ii) in greater detail over a region covering approximately half of this exposure, and (iii) at a high level of detail across four fold structures in the southern part of this western roadcut exposure.\n\n\n3.3\nVein fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analysis\nSampling of veins from various locations, and with different relative timing with respect to folds, was performed to assess fluid composition and depth-pressure conditions at the time of vein formation. Samples included bed-parallel veins, sub-vertical veins, extension veins along fold hinge or axial surface, sub-vertical veins that have been offset by bed-parallel flexural slip on fold limbs, and both normal and reverse faults.\nAnalyses of fluid inclusions and stable isotope geochemistry were performed on samples of vein calcite from faults and extension fractures in the Boquillas Formation to constrain vein formation temperatures and associated fluid history. These analyses were conducted as part of a regional study of the Eagle Ford Formation and laterally equivalent Boquillas Formation (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017, 2020b, 2022) and underlying Austin Chalk (Ferrill et al., 2020a). Collection of samples and preparation and analysis methods for fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry in this study are identical to those described by Ferrill et al. (2020a).\n\n3.3.1\nFluid inclusion microthermometry and UV fluorescence\nVein formation temperature and paleo-fluid composition were constrained by fluid inclusion microthermometry of two-phase aqueous inclusions in the calcite cement. The homogenization temperature (ThA) provides the fluid trapping temperature and the basis for estimating depth of vein formation, while the ice-melting temperature (Tm) is used to determine the trapped fluid salinity (e.g., Evans and Battles, 1999; Parris et al., 2003; Hanks et al., 2006; Becker et al., 2010; Evans, 2010; Evans and Fischer, 2012; Evans et al., 2012, 2014; Ferrill et al., 2017a; 2020a, 2022).\nIn addition, liquid hydrocarbon fluid inclusions were identified by UV fluorescence, which is used to compare trapped fluids between samples to distinguish trapping events. This method has been used extensively to characterize liquid hydrocarbon inclusions (e.g., Bourdet and Eadington, 2012; Bourdet et al., 2012, 2014; Evans et al., 2014; Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017, 2020a, 2022; Volk and George, 2019). The API gravity of the trapped hydrocarbon inclusions can be estimated by the fluorescence color (e.g., Burruss et al., 1983, 1985; McLimans, 1987; Burruss, 1991; Lisk and Eadington, 1994; Parnell et al., 1998). However, the fluorescence color can be affected by a variety of factors including migration fractionation, biodegradation, fluid mixing, and water-washing (George et al., 2001).\n\n\n3.3.2\nStable isotope analysis\nOxygen and carbon isotope analyses were performed on samples of calcite fracture cements and their associated host rocks to determine geochemical relationships between veins and evaluate the source of mineralizing fluids (e.g., Evans et al., 2012, 2014; Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017, 2020a, 2022). Where possible, \u223c100\u00a0mg of vein material was sampled from each vein mineral stage and host rock. However, in most veins the different vein stages were too thin to sample with this approach, and the vein histories are complex at the microscale, therefore whole-vein bulk samples were analyzed. Oxygen and carbon stable isotopic analyses of calcite veins and carbonate-rich host rocks were done by Yale University Earth System Center for Stable Isotopic Studies using a Thermo MAT 254 Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer equipped with a KIEL IV Carbonate Device. Mineral samples were reacted at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min in 104% phosphoric acid. Results are reported on the Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPDB) scale by correcting sample data with Yale-in-house carbonate reference materials PX and MERC. Analytical precision (1 sigma) of Quality Control reference carbonate YM (n\u00a0=\u00a014) is 0.03\u2030 for \u03b413C and 0.04\u2030 for \u03b418O.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nFold analysis\n\n4.1.1\nFold measurements\nFolds in the exposure range from \u223c100-m-wavelength scale, down to minor anticlinal folds with wavelengths of 10's of cm to several meters (Fig. 2\n). The structural style is dominated by relatively narrow anticlines separated by broad flat-bottomed synclines. These small anticlines have detachment fold geometries, with upwardly amplifying folds above detachments in volcanic ash or mudrock layers. In general, a series of multiple folds is detached along a consistent detachment horizon. In some cases, one detachment horizon with overlying folds has been folded by detachment folds formed above a deeper detachment (discussed in next section). Cores of detachment folds exhibit thickening by wedge thrusts, small-scale folds (cm-scale wavelengths), and ductile flow (Fig. 2). Pairs of corresponding bedding measurements \u2013 from equivalent beds on either side of the fold hinge \u2013 were made from opposing limbs of 120 anticlinal folds. These bedding measurements were used to determine the fold axis, axial surface orientation, and interlimb angle for each fold (Table 1\n). Fold axes are mapped in Fig. 3\n, and a stereonet plot of the fold axes is shown in Fig. 4\na. Stereographic analysis shows a dominant fold axis trend of WNW-ESE with an average fold axis trend\/plunge of 281\u00b0\/01\u00b0 (Fig. 4a). Analysis of axial surface orientations shows that axial surfaces verge both to the SSW and NNE (Fig. 4b). The average axial surface strike\/dip is 100\u00b0\/90\u00b0. Fold interlimb angles range from 42\u00b0 to 162\u00b0, with a mean and standard deviation of 111\u00b0 and 26\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). This fold pattern is consistent with NNE-SSW-directed shortening.\n\n\n4.1.2\nFold cross-sections and restorations\nInterpretations of field photographs were used to capture detailed geometries for two of the fold structures (Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). Horizon interpretations document the presence of multiple detachment levels and associated small-scale detachment folds within a larger-scale fold structure in the eastern roadcut of the southern pair of exposures (Fig. 5a). Evidence for bedding-parallel slip is documented on the limbs of this fold where top to NNE and top to SSW layer-parallel offset of bed-perpendicular calcite veins is evident on the SSW and NNE limbs of the fold, respectively (Figs. 5b and c). A fold exposed in the western roadcut of the southern pair of exposures (Fig. 6a) also exhibits offset of bed-perpendicular calcite veins on both fold limbs \u2013 specifically, top to NNE bedding-parallel slip on the SSW limb, and top to SSW slip on the NNE limb of the fold (Fig. 6b and c). Up-dip layer-parallel displacement of calcite veins on fold limbs, and local vergence of layer-parallel slip towards fold crests is consistent with flexural-slip folding in a contractional regime after bed-perpendicular vein formation (e.g., Ramsay, 1967, 1974; Tanner, 1989; Tavani et al., 2015).\nFlexural slip\/flexural flow, line length balanced restorations of the two folds (Figs. 5d and 6d) yield estimated local shortening magnitudes of 6% and 11% for these structures, although overall shortening by folding through these exposures is less than 5%, as discussed below. Restorations for both folds show a systematic increase in restored line length upwards, and therefore an increase in contractional strain upwards through the folds.\nForward modeling of the fold structures was carried out by deforming the restored cross sections to their present-day geometries using a combined flexural flow and flexural slip approach. Passive strain markers in the forward models (Figs. 5e and 6e) illustrate the general increase in shortening strain upwards through both folds, and in the case of Fig. 5 fold, multiple detachment levels and associated thickening of deformed strata. Deformable pin lines in Figs. 5 and 6 mark interpreted null points, where layer-parallel slip (as manifest by offset bed-perpendicular calcite veins) approaches zero within fold hinges, and therefore represent the approximate positions and shapes of fold axial traces both prior to (Figs. 5d and 6d) and after contractional deformation (Figs. 6e and 5e).\nProjected polyline interpretations from the western roadcut of the northern pair of exposures provide a more regional view of deformation patterns at the site (Fig. 7\n). Typical of the small folds in the study area, anticlines are relatively widely spaced \u2013 often several meters to 10's of m apart \u2013 through these roadside outcrops. In Fig. 7d, two detachment levels are visible, including a main detachment level, and an upper minor detachment level with multiple small detachment folds developed above it. The upper minor detachment horizon is folded by folds formed above the main detachment level.\nSimple line length restorations for photogrammetry-derived interpretations yield shortening magnitudes of 2.1% for the entire western roadcut of the northern pair of exposures (Fig. 7a), 3.9% over a region covering approximately half of this exposure (Fig. 7b), and 4.2% for the area that exposes four relatively closely spaced folds in the southern part of this western roadcut exposure (Fig. 7c). Estimated shortening magnitudes for field photograph interpretations (Figs. 5 and 6) and photogrammetry-derived interpretations (Fig. 7) record a trend of decreased shortening magnitudes with larger scales of observation. This result is expected, given that contractional deformation at the site is highest at individual fold structures that are relatively widely spaced across the roadside exposures.\nThere is also a general trend, across scales of observation, for increased folding upwards from the detachment (Figs. 5\u20137). The observed vertical variation in macroscale shortening of pre-kinematic strata suggests that varying amounts of layer-parallel shortening may have been accommodated at smaller scale, below the resolution of the cross section (e.g., Geiser, 1988; Ferrill and Dunne, 1989), and\/or layer-parallel shear transferred displacement laterally (c.f., Epard and Groshong, 1993; Boyer and Mitra, 2019).\n\n\n\n4.2\nExtension fractures, faults and associated calcite veins\nOpening-mode, calcite-cemented extension veins are relatively common in the exposure. These veins typically cut bedding at a high angle. Strikes of 38 measured veins are centered around E-W, ranging from NE-SW to NW-SE (Fig. 8\na). These veins strike approximately parallel to the fold axes, and may have formed to accommodate extension prior to folding (e.g., forebulge flexure; Lash and Engelder, 2007; Tavani et al., 2015; Stage 1a in Ferrill et al., 2021), during folding due to bending strain (outer-arc extension in fold hinges), or during post-folding extensional relaxation. This pattern appears to contrast with the regionally common dominant bimodal NW and NE fracture strikes observed in the Eagle Ford and Boquillas Formations (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2022; Gottardi and Mason, 2018). Rare subhorizontal bed-parallel opening-mode veins were also observed, indicating vertical minimum principal compressive stress representative of a thrust-faulting stress regime (Ferrill et al., 2021) and likely occurred roughly coevally with contractional folding. Formation of bed-parallel veins at this location is also consistent with observations of bed-parallel veins formed during folding in the Boquillas Formation further west (Fig. 8a; Ferrill et al., 2022). While faults are not abundant in these exposures, small-displacement reverse faults are more common than normal faults (Fig. 8b). Dominant strike for nine measured reverse faults is WNW-ESE to WSW-ENE, generally consistent with dominant fold axis orientations and with NNE-SSW shortening in a thrust-faulting stress regime. Dominant strike from five measured normal faults is NW-SE (Fig. 8b), consistent with formation in a normal faulting stress regime either before or after development of the thrust-faulting stress regime (Ferrill et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.3\nVein fluid history and conditions\nVeins in the exposures include sets that are (i) parallel to bedding, and (ii) at a high angle to bedding. Bedding-parallel veins are filled by blocky calcite. High angle to bedding veins are also typically filled by blocky calcite. Fifteen calcite vein samples were collected and analyzed from the Boquillas Formation in this study (Fig. 9\n; Table 2\n), and calcite ranges from single to multiple stages of weakly to moderately twinned blocky calcite to crack-seal textures (Fig. 10\n; Table 2; cf. Ramsay, 1980). Four veins (SN1149-023, \u2212029, \u2212030, \u2212036) exhibit evidence of dissolution after vein cementation and prior to additional cementation by blocky calcite (Table 2).\n\n4.3.1\nFluid inclusion types\nDark (black) to brown tinted single-phase inclusions that are interpreted to be liquid hydrocarbon are present in all veins and in most vein mineral stages. These hydrocarbon inclusions exhibit a wide range of fluorescence behavior, ranging from very weak or no fluorescence (indicating loss of aromatic components; Alpern et al., 1993) to green and pale blue fluorescence colors (Table 2). Two-phase aqueous inclusions that contain water and a vapor bubble suitable for microthermometry are present in four samples (Table 2). The two-phase aqueous inclusions used for microthermometry are typically <5 to over 20 \u03bcm in size and irregularly shaped. Inclusion origins are interpreted to be pseudosecondary or could not be determined, and therefore classified as undifferentiated (Table 2). Commonly, aqueous inclusions lack a vapor bubble and indicate the fluids were trapped at relatively low temperatures and pressures, and that there was not enough energy to nucleate a vapor bubble upon cooling and are therefore in a metastable state (Roedder, 1984; Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). These inclusions are common regionally in the Boquillas Formation and equivalent Eagle Ford Formation (Ferrill et al., 2014a, 2014b; 2017, 2022) and overlying Austin Chalk (Ferrill et al., 2020a).\n\n\n4.3.2\nAqueous inclusion results\nFour samples (SN1149-024, \u2212029, \u2212030, \u2212031) yielded microthermometric data for 14 fluid inclusion assemblages. Upon heating, the two-phase aqueous inclusions homogenized to the liquid phase at temperatures ranging from 71.3 to 100.5\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 2; Fig. 11\n). During cooling runs, the vapor bubbles of many aqueous inclusions completely collapsed during freezing but then reappeared upon warming. For those inclusions where ice melted in the presence of a vapor bubble, the Tm values ranged from \u22120.5 to 0.0\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating salinities of 0.0\u20130.9\u00a0wt % NaCl equivalent (Table 2; Fig. 11; Roedder, 1984).\n\n\n4.3.3\nAqueous fluid trapping conditions\nResults from the fluid inclusion microthermometry can be used to estimate the fluid trapping conditions. The occurrence of subhorizontal bed-parallel veins indicates that fluid pressure exceeded the overburden stress at the time of bed-parallel vein formation (Ukar et al., 2017; Hooker et al., 2019; Ferrill et al., 2022). Rose (2016) estimated the depths of burial for the Boquillas Formation at Lozier Canyon (79\u00a0km northwest of the study area) to be 1.83\u20132.38\u00a0km, with a median of 2.24\u00a0km, and at the West Comstock field site (22\u00a0km northwest of the study area) to be 1.34\u20131.68\u00a0km with a median of 1.52\u00a0km. Rose (2016) estimated the paleogeothermal gradient for the Comstock West area to be 23\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 and for the Lozier Canyon area to be 22\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121.\nHere we use the 23\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 geothermal gradient of Rose (2016) and a paleo-surface temperature during the Cretaceous of 20\u00a0\u00b0C (Ferrill et al., 2020a). Due to the association of aqueous and liquid hydrocarbon inclusions, we assume that aqueous inclusions are methane saturated and a pressure correction is not needed. The lower temperature values from all of the sites range from 71.3 to 88.6\u00a0\u00b0C, providing a trapping depth of 2.23\u20132.98\u00a0km. These values encompass those determined by Rose (2016) for Lozier Canyon, but are significantly higher than those of his Comstock West site. In contrast, the higher homogenization temperatures from the exposures along Hwy 90 West of Del Rio (90.2\u2013100.5\u00a0\u00b0C) suggest a trapping depth of 3.05\u20133.50\u00a0km, significantly higher than either of Rose's (2016) sites, but less than the maximum depth estimate for the Sycamore Bluffs location described by Ferrill et al. (2017), 48\u00a0km southeast of the present study location. High temperature values were also reported by Ferrill et al. (2014b, 2020a) in the Eagle Ford in this area and to the southeast. The higher temperature trapping event may be the result of either (i) deep burial at the time of trapping, or (ii) migration of high temperature fluid into the Boquillas and Eagle Ford Formations.\n\n\n4.3.4\nHydrocarbon inclusion fluorescence\nFour samples from this site have fluorescent hydrocarbon inclusions (Table 2). Sample SN1149-021 from a small normal fault has inclusions with a light blue-green fluorescence, while three extension veins (SN1149-024, \u2212029, \u2212030) have pale blue fluorescence (Fig. 12\n). These fluorescence colors are indicative of 31\u201336\u00b0 API oils (Fig. 12).\n\n\n4.3.5\nStable isotope results\nAll vein isotopic values are significantly different from their associated host rocks (Table 2, Fig. 13\na), indicating that the isotopic composition of the fluids and vein calcite that precipitated from the fluids, were in an isotopically open fluid system. Neither \u03b413C nor \u03b418O values from host rock samples correspond to the expected values for Late Cretaceous carbonates (Fig. 13a; Veizer et al., 1999). This observation suggests significant whole rock alteration since the Cretaceous, consistent with other studies from Austin Chalk, Boquillas Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation in the region (Ferrill et al., 2017, 2020a, 2022). Calcite vein \u03b418O values in all analyzed veins show a very consistent pattern of veins being 2 to 9 per mil lower in \u03b418O than the host rocks (Fig. 13a; Table 2). In general, most veins have only slightly elevated or reduced \u03b413C values with respect to host rock values, with maximum observed increase or decrease of 4 per mil.\n\n\n4.3.6\nEquilibrium fluid calculation\nBy integrating the fluid inclusion ThA data and oxygen isotopic data, the oxygen isotopic composition of the fluid that precipitated the vein minerals can be determined to provide information on the relative contributions of meteoric and formation water to the precipitating fluids. The oxygen isotopic composition of calcite depends on the isotopic composition of the fluid from which it precipitates and the isotopic fractionation between the fluid and the solid. If we assume precipitation in equilibrium with the fluids, the fractionation will depend upon the temperature of the fluids. If the temperature of the fluid is known from the fluid inclusions, the isotopic composition of the fluid can be calculated for calcite-water fractionation using the equation of Friedman and O'Neil (1977). Calculated fluid compositions from the five sites that have ThA data exhibit a narrow range of \u03b418O, from \u22123.78\u2030 to \u22120.12\u2030 V-SMOW indicating meteoric to near seawater isotopic fluid compositions (Fig. 13b).\n\n\n4.3.7\nSummary of fluid history and conditions\nFluid inclusion and stable isotope analysis of veins from this study provide evidence for an evolving fluid system that was generally open to external fluids as evidenced by occurrence of liquid hydrocarbon inclusions and variation in their fluorescence. In addition, the veins that show higher temperature trapping events at the study site suggest a potential fluid influx from deeper and warmer source formations. The oxygen equilibrium fluid values along with the low salinity of the aqueous inclusions suggest a meteoric fluid influx to at least the depth of the formations in this study.\nVein samples from this site are from the central cores of these fold structures as well as fold limbs and from a bed-parallel vein system. These veins in particular record the high temperature fluid trapping event (90.2\u2013100.5\u00a0\u00b0C) that was likely near maximum burial or possibly sourced by deeper fluids. Subhorizontal bed-parallel fracture formation suggests conditions of high pore fluid pressure that was able to overcome the overburden stress to produce vertical dilation in a thrust faulting stress regime, likely coeval with folding.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nTectonic origin of folds\nThe folds investigated in this study have been referred to as \u2018tepees\u2019 and variably interpreted as being related to processes penecontemporaneous with Late Cretaceous deposition (Johnston, 1983), including (i) expansion of a carbonate hardground during deposition in a subtidal to supratidal carbonate depositional environment (Southern Association of Student Geological Societies, 1990; Willett, 1990), and (ii) precipitation and dissolution of gypsum during tidal-flat deposition or subsequent shallow burial (McDaniel, 1992). These so-called \u2018tepees\u2019 have also been interpreted to be related to Quaternary or late Cenozoic wedging by caliche formation along fractures and shale beds after burial and exhumation to near the ground surface (Lock et al., 2001; Lock, 2010). In addition, small-scale folding can also result from downslope movement or slumping of subaqueous sediments and formation of mass transport deposits (see Alsop et al., 2022, and references therein).\nExtensive recent work on the Boquillas Formation and equivalent Eagle Ford Formation in and around the study area have now documented that these formations were deposited in a basinal depositional environment, with most of the section deposited via pelagic sedimentation below storm wave base, rather than in tidal flat depositional environments (Donovan and Staerker, 2010; Donovan et al., 2012; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). Thus, interpretations of the formation of these structures due to tidal-flat processes (e.g., Assereto and Kendall, 1977; Kendall and Warren, 1987) are inherently untenable.\nSlump folds can form in unlithified or \u2018soft\u2019 sediments as gravitationally driven structures (Alvarez and Lowrie, 1984; Alsop and Marco, 2014) associated with formation on a depositional slope and can occur on extremely gentle slopes (<1\u00b0; Garc\u00eda-Tortosa et al., 2011; Alsop and Marco, 2014). During deposition of the Boquillas-Eagle Ford sediments, the study area was at the NW edge of the Maverick Basin (Donovan and Staerker, 2010; Donovan et al., 2012; Breyer et al., 2016; Rose, 2016). If movement was down a depositional slope into the Maverick Basin to the SE, fold axes would be expected to trend NE-SW rather than WNW-ESE as observed in the present study. Soft-sedimentary slump folding is present elsewhere in the Boquillas and Eagle Ford Formations, occurring in zones 1\u20132\u00a0m thick and with lateral continuity of 10's to 100's of meters to >1\u00a0km (Lock and Peschier, 2006; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). These folds typically exhibit inclined to recumbent axial surfaces, and highly curved hinges in some cases changing trend by 90\u00b0 or more over short distances within an outcrop indicative of sheath fold geometries. Some exposures reveal lens or eye-shaped fold patterns reflective of cone or tubular shapes characteristic of sheath fold geometries (cf. Alsop and Holdsworth 2004; Alsop and Carreras, 2007). In these intervals, carbonate (limestone and chalk) and mudrock beds tend to exhibit significant thickness changes, disarticulation of beds, and evidence of significant ductile flowage of mudrock and carbonate beds, and vertical thinning due to subsequent compaction. The folds in the present study do not exhibit evidence of soft-sedimentary deformation processes (c.f., Alsop et al., 2022), but instead are represented by continuity of layering and brittle deformation (extension fracturing, faulting) and folding of competent beds (limestones, chalks) with relatively uniform thicknesses, typical of deformation of lithified rock layers. Thus, we see no evidence to support a soft sedimentary slumping origin for the folds in the present study. Furthermore, low salinity aqueous fluid inclusions from veins that predated folding are indicative of a meteoric water source, which cannot be explained by submarine slump folding of sediments contemporaneous with deposition.\nOur analyses document that calcite veins were formed by brittle fracturing and cementation during moderate burial (i.e., 2\u20133\u00a0km) and in many cases have been offset by flexural slip during folding (Fig. 14\n), indicating that the calcite veins and folds formed after deposition and lithification. Thin beds occasionally exhibit extension fractures in fold hinges that are bed contained and thicken toward fold outer arcs, consistent with bed scale outer-arc-extension bending strain localized in fold hinges during folding (Fig. 14b). Veins were precipitated by warm, very low salinity aqueous fluids with a meteoric influence (Fig. 13b), and were conduits for the migration of mature liquid hydrocarbons (Fig. 12c). Our analyses also document significant horizontal shortening of limestone beds associated with individual structures and sets of structures and continuity of carbonate beds across anticline crests (e.g., Figs. 2, 5, 6, 7) \u2013 observations that are inconsistent with the \u201cvertical lifting up by caliche wedges\u201d model interpreted by Lock et al. (2001; their figure 16B). Caliche is certainly present at the top of the exposures as a thin platy layer, and locally present along some beds and fractures or faults as described by Lock et al. (2001). However, many areas of caliche in the exposures are only a veneer on the outcrop that can be scraped away to reveal continuous laminations in calcareous mudrock, as well as folding and thrust faulting of these laminations that record the thickening mechanisms (Fig. 2). Fold axis orientations for 120 fold structures in the exposures define a dominant WNW-ESE trend (Fig. 3) that is consistent with larger-scale folds within the surrounding Devils River Uplift, and to the south in the Sabinas Basin in Mexico. These fold axis orientations are not consistent with gravity driven slumping down a depositional paleoslope to the southeast into the adjacent Maverick Basin. The folds lack growth strata, and postdate extension fractures that formed by brittle failure of lithified strata and are offset by flexural slip on fold limbs. Veins are cemented by oil-inclusion-bearing calcite veins precipitated from low salinity water rather than seawater. Collectively, the observations and data indicate a tectonic origin for these structures as anticlinal folds, consistent with Laramide contraction in the region.\n\n\n5.2\nDetachment folding\nThe folds range from small (cm- to m-scale wavelengths) to large (wavelengths of 10's to 100's of m). Most of the small-scale folds have amplitudes of 1\u00a0m or less, and these folds are localized above detachments in volcanic ash and mudrock layers that are visible in the exposures. Observed folds generally amplify and tighten upward, consistent with detachment-fold geometries (Dahlstrom, 1990; Epard and Groshong, 1993, 1995; Groshong and Epard, 1994; Homza and Wallace, 1995; Stewart, 1996; Mitra, 2003; Groshong, 2015). Fold amplification occurs by thickening of beds above detachment levels (Figs. 5 and 6). This amplification is represented by thickening of mudrock (shale) beds by both ductile and brittle processes (Fig. 14b), similar to the conceptual model presented by Epard and Groshong (1995; their figure 2). Contorted laminations in some beds illustrate tight folding associated with ductile shortening and thickening (e.g., Figs. 2c and d). Other examples include single or multiple thrust faults that locally thicken beds and amplify folds (e.g., Figs. 2e and f).\nAt least two detachment levels can be observed in the exposures (e.g., Figs. 7c and d). In the northern exposures, a higher detachment is deformed by folds above a deeper detachment horizon. This deformation is consistent with a common break-forward deformation sequence fold-thrust belt (Boyer and Mitra, 2019), where shallow deformation at the leading edge of a thrust belt is subsequently deformed by later deformation initiated deeper in the section.\nThe observed structural style, with relatively tight anticlines separated by broad flat-bottom synclines, is consistent with the deformation style in fold-thrust belts with weak detachments, such as salt or overpressured shale (Davis and Engelder, 1985). The presence of horizontal or subhorizontal bed-parallel opening mode calcite veins (Figs. 9h and i) indicates vertical minimum principal stress and a thrust faulting stress regime (Ferrill et al., 2021, 2022, Fig. 14b), and that fluid pressure was high enough to overcome the vertical overburden stress and tensile strength of the rock at the time of horizontal vein formation. Such elevated fluid pressure was likely a major factor for the formation and sliding along bed-parallel detachments and associated folding. Later subvertical veins abut or cut across bed-parallel calcite veins (see Fig. 9i), which we interpret to represent either local normal faulting stress regime conditions (Fig. 14c) due to outer-arc bending strain associated with longer wavelength (100-m scale) folding, or a return to regional normal faulting regime conditions during post-Laramide extensional relaxation. We interpret that this extension produced occasional vertical veins in horizontal beds, fold limbs, and along fold axial surfaces.\nFold trains similar to those documented here are often localized within certain intervals of a stratigraphic section where internal buckling is mechanically preferred over other shortening mechanisms such as distributed cleavage development or thrust faulting. In some cases, localized contractional folding develops as a \u201cfold duplex\u201d where local folding occurs and kinematically transfers displacement between two detachment levels (Dahlstrom, 1990; Boyer and Mitra, 2019). Consequently, detachment fold systems do not tend to be vertically pervasive, but instead tend to be localized above and\/or below detachment horizons that transfer displacement laterally where displacement may be accommodated by contraction at other stratigraphic levels. This pattern of stratigraphically localized contraction rather than pervasive folding is consistent with observations from the study area. Furthermore, small-scale contractional folding, reverse faulting, and bed-parallel vein formation that represents deformation in a thrust faulting stress regime should be expected in the western part of the productive Eagle Ford oil and gas system, which is proximal to the frontal limit of macroscale Laramide contractional deformation (Fig. 1). Both the Zavala syncline and Chittim anticline (southeast of the study locality) fall within the Laramide macrostructural front and represent larger-scale structures of Laramide age, with orientations that are approximately consistent with the outcropping folds documented in this study. The structures documented in this study all contribute to vertical thickening of the stratigraphic section. Dipping beds on fold limbs, small faults, and veins represent mechanical fabric elements that may influence horizontal drilling and permeability structure. These fabrics also may reactivate by slip or dilation during hydraulic fracturing prior to stress conditions being reached necessary for failure of undeformed intact rock. Based on results of investigations presented in this paper, we conclude that the folds are tectonic in origin and formed under considerable overburden. The deformation style is consistent with the regionally recognized Laramide shortening in the region (Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Webster and Calhoun, 1984).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nBased on analysis of 120 small-scale anticlines and associated calcite veins, we show that mesoscale folds in the Boquillas Formation within the Devils River Uplift in southwest Texas formed during NNE-SSW directed Laramide shortening while the strata were buried at moderate depths (2.23\u20133.50\u00a0km), rather than via processes penecontemporaneous with Late Cretaceous deposition or near-surface caliche formation during the late Cenozoic. Laramide deformation consisted of broadly NE-SW contraction during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene. Deposition of the Boquillas Formation pre-dated this deformation and the folds described here have orientations consistent with other Laramide structures nearby. Dominant WNW-ESE fold trends are consistent with larger-scale folds within the surrounding Devils River Uplift, and to the south in the Sabinas Basin in Mexico. The anticlines formed as detachment folds, exhibiting bed-parallel flexural-slip offset of bed-perpendicular extension veins. This relationship provides clear evidence of folding after lithification and brittle (tensile) failure. Detachments in volcanic ash and mudrock were likely severely overpressured at the time, as indicated by the local presence of sub-horizontal bedding parallel blocky calcite veins. Tectonic compaction without draining of these inherently low-permeability strata would have strongly contributed to development and maintenance of the overpressure that allowed bedding-plane slip, ductile behavior of volcanic ash and mudrock beds, and detachment folding.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nDavid A.

They have subsequently been documented in over 150 basins around the world, where they typically span areas of 105\u2013107\u00a0km2 and occur in stratigraphically restricted intervals (tiers) composed dominantly of fine-grained sediments (Fig. 1\n) (Cartwright, 2011 and references therein).\nThe widespread occurrence of PFSs within the shallow subsurface of many slope or basin floor settings suggests they initiate and begin to propagate early in the burial history of the host tier (Cartwright, 1994a,b; Berndt et al., 2003; Stuevold et al., 2003), perhaps within tens of metres of the sea floor (Morgan et al., 2015). Numerous studies have suggested that polygonal faults propagate upwards through the near surface sediments with continued burial and sedimentation (Lonergan et al., 1998a; Goulty, 2001a; Stuevold et al., 2003; Gay and Berndt, 2007; Davies and Ireland, 2011; Tewksbury et al., 2014). The important question of whether or not polygonal faults can be regarded as syn-sedimentary faults in which the upper fault tip breaches the contemporaneous depositional surface is still open, although several authors have used growth indices or fault network characteristics to argue that this is generally the case (Lonergan et al., 1998a; Stuevold et al., 2003; Morgan et al., 2015). Most recently, King and Cartwright (2020) identified small bathymetric scarps on the present sea floor offshore Norway to argue that these were the surface expression of syn-sedimentary polygonal faults, confirming similar observations made in the Rockall Trough by Berndt et al. (2012).\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the nucleation and growth of PFSs, but most have been discounted as universal mechanisms because they cannot explain the formation or growth of all polygonal fault systems observed globally (Cartwright et al., 2003; Goulty, 2008; Cartwright, 2011). In recent years, \u2018gravitational loading\u2019 (Goulty, 2001a; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005) and \u2018diagenetically-induced shear failure\u2019 (Shin et al., 2008, 2010; Cartwright, 2011) have been favoured as mechanisms to explain the later propagation and early initiation of polygonal faults, respectively.\nThe gravitational loading mechanism is the main focus of our modelling study presented in this paper. It provides an elegant geomechanical explanation of the upward propagation of already well developed fault zones with increasing sediment loads of progressive burial (Goulty, 2001a,b; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005; Goulty, 2008). The residual failure criterion of a pre-existing fault is exceeded under laterally confined loading conditions (Fig. 2\n A) if it is hosted within a material with a sufficiently low residual friction angle and a high K0 value. K0 is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure \u2018at rest\u2019, calculated as the ratio of the horizontal effective stress over the vertical effective stress, which is typically \u223c0.3\u20130.4 for coarse-grained sediments and >0.7 for fine-grained sediments (Jones, 1994; Goulty, 2001a; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005; Casey, 2014). However, the gravitational loading mechanism does not explain either the nucleation of polygonal faults or how displacement is accommodated.\nIn contrast, it has been suggested that the diagenetically-induced shear failure mechanism may explain the full evolution of a PFS, from genesis to fossilisation (Shin et al., 2008, 2010; Cartwright, 2011). In this model, a diagenetically-induced change in the grain volume or contact stresses between grains results in a decrease in the minimum principal stress, which can cause the localisation and continued propagation of a shear fracture. Furthermore, the volumetric reduction associated with such a diagenetic mechanism can help accommodate the local strains required by displacement gradients on the fault surface in laterally-pinned conditions (Shin et al., 2008).\nAttempts at resolving the relative merits of competing models using numerical modelling have been limited to date. Shin et al. (2010) used a Drucker-Prager model to investigate the physical properties that are required to accommodate the strain and deformation that arise from the growth of a laterally-pinned fault. Shin et al. (2010) found that the throw-to-height scaling relationships of polygonal faults were only achieved at exceptionally low material bulk stiffness values and attributed this finding to diagenetic grain dissolution, following results from earlier physical modelling work (Shin et al., 2008). However, the bulk material stiffness term used in the Shin et al. (2010) Drucker-Prager models does not explicitly incorporate gravity-driven mechanical compaction of granular sediment. Roberts et al. (2014) and Roberts (2014) used the ELFEN geomechanical code and a SoftRock 3 constitutive model to demonstrate that a diagenetically-triggered isotropic chemical porosity reduction, such as that caused by the transition of opal-A to opal-CT, of 5% was sufficient to localise and propagate shear fractures that resembled the geometries and network intersections of polygonal faults in two-dimensional cross-section and three-dimensional planforms. Roberts et al. (2014) and Roberts (2014) also showed that a horizontal stress anisotropy of just 3% was enough to align over 80% of fault orientations to within \u00b110\u00b0 of the maximum horizontal stress. Despite the advances made by these pioneering studies, our understanding of the relative magnitudes of different drivers of PFS growth is limited, and the role of gravity-driven mechanical compaction may have been overlooked as a means of accommodating polygonal fault displacement.\nIn this study, we used the gravitational loading model proposed by Goulty (2001) as a basis to numerically model the hypothesis that gravity-driven differential compaction drives the accumulation of throw on pre-existing polygonal faults that are hosted in laterally-pinned (i.e. the lateral boundaries of the model are fixed) unconsolidated sediments, under realistic physical property conditions. To test the model, we developed a series of laterally-pinned finite element models using the ELFEN geomechanical code, to examine the evolution of a single fault that propagates synchronously with the deposition of granular compacting sediment. We investigated the sensitivity of the accrual of fault displacement with respect to three main variables: (1) material compaction profiles, (2) residual friction angles, and (3) fault dip angles, in order to evaluate under what conditions the continued propagation of a normal fault might be driven by gravitational loading alone. Although aimed at the study of polygonal fault systematics, this type of modelling approach is applicable to other types of normal faults hosted in relatively unlithified and compactable sediments, so the results have wider implications than simply for PFSs.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\n\n2.1\nComputational framework\nTo undertake our analysis, we used the ELFEN forward modelling geomechanical code, which is a finite strain, quasi-static, explicit finite element continuum formulation. The underlying computational methods are discussed extensively by Per\u00edc and Crook (2004). This modelling framework has been used to solve a host of geological problems ranging from salt tectonics (Nikolinakou et al., 2014a,b) to regional fold and thrust belts (Albertz and Lingrey, 2012), as well as previous studies of polygonal fault systems (Roberts et al., 2014; Roberts, 2014). However, alternative modelling approaches such as the Discrete Element Method (DEM), which unlike the finite element continuum approach does not use a pre-defined material constitutive model but instead models the interaction of rock particle assemblages governed by Newton's laws of motion, have been used to solve similar geological problems (Finch et al., 2003; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2009; Gray et al., 2014). We selected a finite element approach because the DEM approach can require excessively long solution times due to the searches needed to evaluate the particle interactions, which can therefore limit the model resolution (Yinet al., 2009), and the calibration of some DEM models can present challenges in obtaining values recorded from physical experiments (Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2009). The ability to pre-define the material behaviour in a continuum approach offered greater specificity when designing a sensitivity analysis of granular material compaction trends, and previous studies of PFSs using these modelling tools provided a proof of concept prior to embarking on our study. However, both the finite element and discrete element methods offer valid approaches to the study of polygonal fault systems.\n\n\n2.2\nConstitutive model\nThe constitutive model relates deformational strains and stresses through a set of equations (see Supplementary Material for detailed descriptions) that comprise material-specific parameters, such as frictional and dilational angles. We used the SoftRock 3 (SR3) constitutive model, which is an advanced variant of the Modified Cam Clay model (Crook et al., 2006) that is derived from Critical State Soil Mechanics theory (Schofield and Wroth, 1968; Muir Wood, 1990), in our study because it explicitly incorporates the role of granular sediment compaction in material deformation. Alternative constitutive frameworks, such as the Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager models have been used in several computational geological studies (Schultz-Ela, 2003; Gradmann et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2010), however, they do not explicitly account for granular compaction and are therefore, better suited to the characterisation of lithified and crystalline rocks. Several previous studies have used an SR3 constitutive framework to model the elastoplastic deformation associated with salt diapirs rising through porous sediments (Nikolinakou et al., 2014a,b), and the investigation of polygonal faulting in unconsolidated fine-grained sediments (Roberts et al., 2014; Roberts, 2014).\nThe methodology and calibration of the SoftRock 3 constitutive framework are discussed extensively by Crook et al. (2006), Rockfield (2010), and Roberts et al. (2014). This approach offers a fully regularised treatment of softening and identification of emerging localisations, extending the seminal work of Rudnicki and Rice (1975). The full elastoplastic formulation is included in the Supplementary Material, however, we use a reduced subset of its full capability in our analysis. Specifically, rather than determining the nucleation and propagation of the fault plane via the intersection of the material stress path with the state boundary surface as in the diagenetically-induced fault nucleation simulations undertaken by Roberts et al. (2014), we instead prescribe the fault with a frictional planar surface. In addition, the SoftRock 3 constitutive framework includes a porous elastic law that is included in our simulations, but its influence is negligible over the burial depths of our material models which are instead primarily deforming via compaction-related plastic strain determined by the hardening law (see Supplementary Material).\n\n\n2.3\nModel setup\n\n2.3.1\nModelling strategy\nOur modelling strategy was designed to test the gravitational loading model for polygonal fault growth. Our primary goal was to investigate the extent to which stress perturbations related to low friction coefficients on a fully developed fault surface would result in differential compaction of hanging wall versus footwall (Fig. 3\n). We constructed a suite of two-dimensional field-scale finite element models that simulate the upward propagation of a pre-existing normal fault from a fixed lower tip with synchronous sedimentation in laterally-pinned plane-strain conditions. We assumed that the pore fluid pressure was hydrostatic throughout the evolution of the model simulations, based on the recognition that polygonal fault systems are commonly hosted in hemipelagic depositional systems with low sedimentation rates in which significant disequilibrium compaction overpressure is unlikely to develop (Cartwright and Dewhurst, 1998 and references therein).\nThe numerical modelling programme was designed to allow a sensitivity analysis of the accrual of fault throw with respect to three key variable parameters. Firstly, the bulk lithology of the sequence hosting a polygonal fault and its typical compactional response to burial. Since polygonal fault systems are hosted in a range of dominantly fine-grained lithologies, it was regarded as important to capture the compactional response of this broad range of materials. Secondly, the friction angle of the fault plane (residual friction angle), because as argued by Goulty (2002), this should be a critical parameter governing conditions allowing continued slip on the fault. Finally, the dip angle at which the fault plane propagates since this partly controls the shear stress resolved on the fault plane.\nThe models comprise a thin initially deposited basal unit that hosts a pre-existing fault plane which then propagates upwards from a fixed lower tip within that basal unit as additional layers are added above (Fig. 3). The upward fault propagation occurs synchronously with the deposition of 1000\u00a0m of unconsolidated granular material at a sedimentation rate of 100\u00a0m\/m.y. over fifty 0.2 million-year time increments, simulating 10 million-years. Downward propagation of the basal tip is inhibited by detachment at the lower boundary of the model (see next section).\nMaterial compaction is fully coupled throughout all fifty depositional stages, where we assume fully-drained conditions with no build-up of overpressure. The material compaction profile, the initial fault plane dip and residual friction angle are prescribed for each model simulation, and their respective influences on fault throw are investigated via sensitivity analysis. The material compaction profile with increasing burial depth is prescribed in each simulation, where we investigate four primary compaction curves (outlined in \n\nSection 3.3.3\n\n). The fault plane friction angle (residual friction angle) remains constant in each simulation, and is investigated over values of 5\u00b0, 7\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 11\u00b0. The fault dip angle is prescribed on the upper tip segment that propagates at each 0.2 million-year time increment, however, the fault dip angle shallows dynamically with burial as a result of compaction creating a degree of fault dip listricity. We investigate initial dip angle values of 40\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 70\u00b0, and 80\u00b0, which when compacted shallow by as much as 15\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 at depth. These values were selected from the range of natural dip measurements of polygonal faults (Neagu et al., 2010).\n\n\n2.3.2\nBoundary conditions\nThe width of the models are set so that there is no interaction between fault-related deformations in the central portion of the model and the lateral boundary conditions, and vice versa. All models are 2000\u00a0m wide with element sizes of \u223c5\u00a0m, except for the investigation of a 40\u00b0 dipping fault plane which requires a 3000\u00a0m wide model to prevent edge effects. All of the models have frictionless boundary conditions at both their lateral edges and base, where elements at the model boundaries are confined but are able to slide freely. The basal slip condition was selected to represent natural examples where a basal detachment has been interpreted at the base of regional polygonally faulted tiers (Cartwright, 2011) and may also be considered akin to an overpressured basal mobile layer as suggested by Nicol et al. (2003). We note that a fully-fixed basal boundary condition also produces appreciable displacement.\n\n\n2.3.3\nMaterial characterisation\nWe characterised four materials, m1-m4, to capture a range of different compaction profiles that are exhibited by fine-grained sediments. All materials used in our analysis are characterised with the same underlying elastic physical property and SR3 property parameters (see Supplementary Material, Tables SM1 and SM2), however, each material has a unique compaction profile that is defined by a piecewise linear lambda-kappa parameter in the hardening law (see Supplementary Material) all with an initial porosity value of 70%.\nOver the shallow burial depths analysed in our models, gravitationally-driven volumetric strains of high porosity granular sediments are predominately plastic rather than elastic. We include the SR3 porous elastic laws (see Supplementary Material) in our material characterisation for completeness, however, our models are insensitive to changes in both the stiffness parameter value (E) and Poisson's ratio paramater value (\u03bd) that fall within the range of those recorded from fine-grained sediments (Santamarina et al., 2001). Furthermore, the SR3 property parameters used to define the state boundary surface are included (see Supplementary Material). It should be noted that fault plane propagation is prescribed in our models rather than determined via the intersection of the material stress path with the state boundary surface. The SR3 frictional and dilational parameters were chosen such that the material is characterised with a K0 value of 0.7\u20130.72 typical of fine-grained sediments (Jones, 1994; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005; Casey, 2014).\nThe compaction profiles that define each material (m1-m4) have been guided by consideration of compaction curves from shales and argillaceous sediments, experimental compaction curves derived from kaolinite-smectite aggregates, and porosity-versus-depth data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) wells that logged four different polygonal fault systems (Fig. 4\n). These reference compaction curves were selected to capture the range of natural compaction behaviour in the shallow burial regime typical of the growth of polygonal fault systems (Cartwright et al., 2003). They define the trajectory of a given starting lithology in porosity-depth space, yielding incremental differences in both the gradient of compaction with depth and the absolute amount of compaction. The m1, m2, and m3 materials are defined to capture the upper, middle, and lower ranges of compaction curve profiles recorded from fine-grained sediments in previous compaction studies (compiled in Mondol et al., 2007). The m4 material more closely traces the porosity versus depth profiles of biosiliceous fine-grained sediments recorded from ODP boreholes that transect known polygonal fault systems (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1987,1990, 1996, 2001). After the first 150\u00a0m of burial the compaction gradients of the m1 and m4 materials are approximately equal, which presents an opportunity to compare the influence of the absolute magnitude and the gradient of volumetric reduction on the accrual of fault throw.\nThe material residual friction angle (fault friction angle) is a variable parameter that is investigated through sensitivity analysis over values between 5\u00b0 and 11\u00b0. This range of values was selected based on experimental data from ring shear, drained shear box, and rotary shear tests of claystones and siliceous mudstones (Table 1\n). It is challenging to scale up from experimental measurements of residual shear strength to the effective residual shear strength of a natural fault zone many tens to hundreds of metres tall and perhaps tens of centimetres wide. However, in the absence of any data from natural faults the experimentally derived values were considered to be the best starting point for this modelling study.\n\n\n2.3.4\nModel outputs\nA standard set of outputs was generated for each model simulation, including effective mean stress, effective mean stress perturbation, horizontal effective mean stress perturbation, vertical effective mean stress perturbation, and vector plots of principal stress values. Fault throw was measured as the throw at each stratigraphic marker along the fault plane for each growth increment. Throw was measured rather than displacement to enable ease of comparison to previous polygonal fault studies, in which throw is the standard measure derived from seismic reflection datasets. These measurements were plotted as throw versus height profiles. Maximum throw (Tmax) against fault height ratios were generated for the full suite of model simulations and were benchmarked to the global range of Tmax versus height values compiled by Shin et al. (2010). Throw rates for the final stages of each model simulation were derived by taking the throw value at the stratigraphic marker deposited one million years before the present timestep.\n\n\n2.3.5\nKinematic justification\nThe kinematics of our fault propagation models are based on previous studies that have shown: (1) polygonal faults nucleate in the lower portions of their tiers early in their burial history (Cartwright et al., 2003); (2) polygonal faults propagate in an upwards direction for much of their growth histories (Morgan et al., 2015), where their downward propagation is impeded by a basal mechanical barrier or a detachment into a mobile basal layer (Cartwright et al., 2003; Cartwright, 2011); (3) polygonal fault systems are found at the present day (Gay and Berndt, 2007; Berndt et al., 2012; Armandita et al., 2015; Morgan et al., 2015) and paleo-seabed, as evidenced by small growth packages (Cartwright, 1994a, 2011; Lonergan et al., 1998a; Stuevold et al., 2003; Laurent et al., 2012; King and Cartwright, 2020), which suggests that polygonal faults can propagate upwards at or near the seabed; (4) fault propagation may occur synchronously with gravitational loading in sediments with sufficiently high K0 values and sufficiently low residual friction angles (Goulty, 2001a; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005) (Fig. 2 A); (5) hemipelagic sedimentation rates in deep marine depositional environments are low (\u223c2\u2013200\u00a0m\/m.y.) (Cartwright and Dewhurst, 1998; Shipboard Scientific Party, 1987, 1990, 1996, 2001).\nGeometrical and quantitative measures to compare our modelling results and test our hypothesis are offered by the maximum throw (Tmax) versus height empirical scaling relationship established by Shin et al. (2010), and a plethora of polygonal fault throw versus height profiles from multiple basins around the world (Neagu et al., 2010; Turrini et al., 2017; Wrona et al., 2017). Recently recorded throw rates from surface-breaching polygonal fault upper tips from the V\u00f8ring Basin (King and Cartwright, 2020) were used to compare with growth rates generated in the models.\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nIn order to obtain adequate comparisons of model outputs for the three main variable parameters of friction, dip, and material compaction properties (Fig. 5\n), outputs were generated for a total of 18 numerical model simulations. An illustrative example of the temporal evolution of a single fault growth model is shown in Figs. 6 and 7\n\n for the m1-fr5-d60 model (where m1 is the material model, fr5 represents the residual friction angle used was 5\u00b0, and d60 represents the fault propagated with a dip angle of 60\u00b0) at 2 million-year time increments. A principal stress vector plot for this model at the 10 million-year timestep is presented in Fig. 8\n. This shows that there is considerable rotation of the maximum and minimum stresses associated with frictional sliding on the fault plane (Mandl, 1988). The stress field is unperturbed at the lateral edges of the models, where the effective mean stress increases monotonically with depth as the result of one-dimensional consolidation (Terzaghi and Peck, 1948). Effective mean stress perturbations are found on both sides of the fault plane, where they dissipate to ambient values within a few hundred metres of the fault plane (Fig. 6). The results of our full suite of model simulations are illustrated in Fig. 5.\n\n3.1\nMaterial compaction and fault throw\nFaults hosted within each of the m1-m4 materials (Fig. 5 A) yield different maximum throw values with respect to the fault height (Fig. 5 B), implying that the compactional response plays a key role in the accumulation of throw. The greatest maximum throw values accrue on faults hosted in the m1 material (Fig. 5 B), which exhibits the largest degree of compaction with burial depth of the four selected material characterisations (Fig. 5 A). Faults hosted in the m2 and m3 materials accrue lower maximum throw values compared to faults hosted in the m1 material (Fig. 5 B), which reflects the incrementally lower compactional strain accumulated with burial depth (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, faults hosted in the m4 material initially accrue lower maximum throw values than faults hosted in the m2 and m3 materials at heights less than 450\u00a0m and 600\u00a0m, respectively. However, at fault heights greater than 450\u00a0m and 600\u00a0m, respectively, the maximum throw values are larger for faults hosted in the m4 material than their m2 and m3 counterparts (Fig. 5 B). The gradient of the Tmax versus fault height trends (Fig. 5 B) for faults hosted in the m1 and m4 materials are approximately equal, which reflects the similarities in their compaction profile gradients at burial depths deeper than 150\u00a0m (Fig. 5 A). However, faults hosted in the m1 material yield larger maximum throw values than those of faults hosted in our m4 material because of the differences in their compaction profiles in the first 150\u00a0m of burial below the surface.\nThe gradients of the Tmax versus fault height trends (Fig. 5 B) for faults hosted in the m2 and m3 materials decrease with increasing fault height in a curvilinear fashion as the rate of material compaction reduces with greater burial depth. In contrast, the near-constant gradients of the Tmax versus fault height trends of faults hosted in the m1 and m4 materials reflect their respective near-constant compaction profiles with burial depths in excess of 150\u00a0m (Fig. 5 A). Once the sediment hosting the fault ceases to undergo further compaction, as characterised by the m3inh and m4inh materials (Fig. 5 A) at burial depths greater than \u223c350\u00a0m, the Tmax versus fault height gradient decreases dramatically to near-zero with increasing fault height (Fig. 5 B).\nThe influence of inhibited material compaction with burial depth on the accrual of fault throw is seen most clearly in the effective stress contour plots and accompanying throw versus height plots illustrated in Figs. 9\u201311\n\n\n. Here we see that throw continues to accumulate in the upper portions of the faults that are hosted in compacting stratigraphy at burial depths shallower tha\u00f1350\u00a0m, but fault throw ceases to accumulate on deeper portions of the faults that are hosted in stratigraphic intervals which do not undergo compaction (Figs. 9 and 10).\nThe throw versus height plots of the m3inh and m4inh simulations exhibit flat gradients across the central portion of the fault, where throw values are roughly constant \u2013 characteristic of \u2018M-style\u2019 faults \u2013 and the locus of maximum throw migrates up the fault. This pattern contrasts with that seen for the simulations using material m3 and m4 uninhibited which have Tmax values located in the lower to central third of the fault height and \u2018C-shaped\u2019 throw versus height profiles (Fig. 11) (Muraoka and Kamata, 1983). The m3inh and m4inh simulations also exhibit elevated effective mean stress perturbations in the lower portion of the tier compared to their m3 and m4 simulations (Figs. 9 and 10).\n\n\n3.2\nDip angles and fault throw\nTo examine the impact of fault dip on fault growth, we simply selected the material and friction angle most likely to yield the maximum throw values, i.e. the m1 material with a residual friction angle of 5\u00b0. During each model simulation, the effect of increasing burial was to reduce the dip of the initial fault plane as a result of compaction of the entire cross-section. This decrease of dip due to compactional flattening has been observed for polygonal fault dips in a detailed study from offshore Norway (Neagu et al., 2010) (Figs. 5 G & 14) but is likely to occur generally (Stuevold et al., 2003; Cartwright, 2011). It is worth noting that throw is not a good proxy for displacement as the dip decreases with increasing burial depth, and this should be borne in mind when examining the plots.\nFor the four model simulations of varying initial dips of 40, 50, 60 and 70\u00b0, the largest throw values accumulated on faults that propagated with an initial dip of 60\u00b0 (Figs. 14\u201316). Interestingly, smaller throws were measured for faults with greater and lesser initial dips (Fig. 5 D & F and Fig. 15). Faults with dip propagation angles of 40\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 70\u00b0, and 80\u00b0 yield Tmax values of 61%, 87%, 83%, and 31%, respectively, of that obtained for an initial dip of 60\u00b0 (Fig. 5 F). The throw versus height plots reveal (Figs. 15 and 16) that steeply dipping fault planes yield more evenly distributed \u2018C-shaped\u2019 throw versus height profiles and shallower dipping fault planes yield \u2018L-shaped\u2019 throw versus height profiles with greater throw values skewed to the lower portions of the fault (Muraoka and Kamata, 1983; Turrini et al., 2017). At the maximum fault height achieved at the end of the m1 material simulations, the joint-steepest gradients of the Tmax versus fault height trends are found on the faults with propagating dip angles of 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 (Fig. 5 D). When taking account of compaction of the dip angle (Figs. 5 G & 14), the average compacted dips of the 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 cases are \u223c40\u00b0\u201350\u00b0 and \u223c50\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 respectively. This is consistent with the stress decomposition of an overburden load with respect to a fracture plane, where the maximum shear stress occurs at a 45\u00b0 angle to the maximum principal stress (Fossen, 2016).\n\n\n3.3\nResidual friction angles and fault throw\nTo explore the sensitivity of fault growth to variation in the residual friction angle, models were run with a fault plane with a propagation dip of 60\u00b0 hosted in each of the m1-m4 materials over residual friction angles of 5\u00b0, 7\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 11\u00b0 (Table 1). For fixed values of fault dip and material properties, throw values are always highest on faults with the lowest residual friction angles (Fig. 5 C). Maximum throw values decrease exponentially with increasing residual friction angles, reaching zero when the fault plane friction angle equals the host material peak friction angle (Fig. 5 E).\nAt residual friction angles of 5\u00b0, all four of the material characterisations yield high maximum throw values with respect to the fault height, with values in the upper range of those recorded from polygonal fault systems (Shin et al., 2010). As the residual friction angle increases to 7\u00b0, the maximum throw values with respect to fault height derived from our four material models decrease by \u223c45%, with values in the mid-lower end of those recorded polygonal fault systems (Shin et al., 2010). An increase in the residual friction angle by a further two degrees to 9\u00b0 yields maximum throw with respect to fault height values that are below the lowest values recorded from polygonal fault systems. At residual friction angles of 11\u00b0 throw does not accumulate in measurable quantities across the fault plane. If the model results can legitimately be extrapolated to natural systems, this suggests that polygonal faults do not accumulate displacement at residual friction angles greater than 11\u00b0 under fully drained gravitational loading conditions (Figs. 5 C and 17).\n\n\n3.4\nThrow versus height profiles\nThe throw versus height profiles derived from our models (Figs. 6, 9, 12, 15, 17 and 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n) are comparable to those derived from PFS studies from basins around the world (Morgan et al., 2015; Turrini et al., 2017; Wrona et al., 2017). Common to all the simulated throw versus height profiles is the steeper lower tip gradient compared to the upper tip gradient (Table 2\n and Fig. 19). A greater proportion of the throw accrues in the lower third and central third of the tier. Fault throw versus height profiles have curved \u2018C-shaped\u2019 or \u2018L-shaped\u2019 geometries for material models with high degrees of compaction. For the m3inh and m4inh simulations, which incorporate layers that do not compact, the throw versus height profiles have a flatter \u2018M-shaped\u2019 central portion and lower maximum throw with respect to fault height values (Table 2 and Figs. 11 and 19).\nAn example of the temporal evolution of throw with respect to increasing fault height is illustrated in Fig. 6. Here fault throw accumulates proportionately with successive fault propagation and sedimentation throughout the temporal evolution of our models. Throw versus height plots have quasi-symmetric profiles in the earliest phases of growth (\u22642.5 million-years) that become more asymmetric with continued fault growth through time (\u22655 million-years), where greater throw values are skewed towards the lower third of the fault.\n\n\n3.5\nThrow rates\nThrow rates measured for the final million years of each model simulation range between 0 and 10.45\u00a0m\/m.y. The fastest throw rates were recorded on the faults with the greatest Tmax values as a percentage of the fault height (Table 2 and Fig. 20\n). The measured throw rates increase temporally throughout the evolution of the models, reflecting the greater amounts of throw that accumulate at each subsequent timestep because of the larger thickness of differentially compacting sediment in the footwall and hanging wall as the fault height increases (Fig. 20). The throw rates recorded from our model simulations exhibit the same range as those recorded from a PFS in the V\u00f8ring Basin, where similar sedimentation rates are recorded to those used in our models (King and Cartwright, 2020).\n\n\n3.6\nStress field perturbations\nThe effective stress outputs from the models (Figs. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15\u201318) reveal a consistent pattern of effective mean stress perturbations in both the fault footwalls and hanging walls. The lower region of the footwalls closest to the base of each model exhibit reduced effective stress relative to the far field values and hence are \u2018shadowed\u2019 from the full extent of the overburden load. In contrast the basal regions of hanging walls exhibit enhanced effective stress values because frictional sliding on the fault plane facilitates a rotation of the principal stress axes (Fig. 8). Enhanced effective mean stress anomalies dissipate to the background values within a few hundred metres of the fault. The shapes of these anomalous regions of enhanced or reduced effective stress vary from model to model, but in general the magnitude of these stress anomalies corresponds well to the parameter combinations which yield the greatest throw values.\nThe horizontal effective stress perturbations are elevated in a triangular region adjacent to the fault plane and in a basal region at the lower tier boundary in the fault hanging wall. The horizontal effective stress perturbations are reduced (blue colours) in the lowermost footwall and in a dilational triangular zone in the hanging wall that separates the two aforementioned elevated areas, which is associated with the hinge of bed rotation caused by frictional sliding on the fault plane. The vertical effective stress perturbations are elevated in a circular shaped focal region at the base of the fault hanging wall, and are reduced in a \u223c100\u00a0m radius of the fault plane in both the footwall and hanging wall.\nThe effective mean stress (and both the vertical and horizontal components) perturbations are greater in the m3inh and m4inh material models which stop compacting at depths in excess of \u223c350\u00a0m. In the m3inh and m4inh cases, the focal regions of effective stress perturbations migrate upward across the portion of the fault plane hosted within non-compacting strata (Figs. 9 and 10). The lateral boundaries of all simulations exhibit unperturbed one-dimensional consolidation stress fields.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nOur study aimed to evaluate the model suggested by Goulty (2001, 2002) for gravitational loading as a mechanism to explain the growth of polygonal faults. We designed a numerical modelling programme to evaluate the impact of varying the residual friction on the fault and its dip on the stress state adjacent to a single polygonal fault under protracted burial and loading conditions (Fig. 3). We attempted to capture the realistic range of compaction parameters for the typical sediments that are known to host polygonal faults and used these material models as a third variable in a set of sensitivity analyses. Our results allow us to propose some general inferences that may be directly applicable in natural fault systems.\n\n4.1\nStress perturbations and differential compaction\nA key finding of this study is that if a fault is characterised by uniformly distributed, residual friction values of 9\u00b0 or less, then for a wide range of fault dips there is a measurable perturbation in the state of stress around the fault, with stress shadowing in the footwall, and localised stress enhancement in the hanging wall, particularly evident close to the basal tier boundary. These stress perturbations include components of both vertical and horizontal stress increase\/decrease. This implies that simply under purely passive gravitational loading with no lateral strain (the formally defined K0 loading condition, Lambe and Whitman, (1994)) under which polygonal faults are widely believed to form (Cartwright and Lonergan, 1996), there is a significant component of horizontal compaction and hence line length reduction in a bed-parallel direction, as argued by Goulty (2002). Furthermore, the perturbation in the stress field results in a fundamental asymmetry across the fault and that in turn leads to differential volumetric strains across the fault, and it is this differential straining that necessitates semi-continuous slip on the fault surface to accommodate the wall rock strains of different magnitudes.\nIn soft, unlithified, fine grained sediments of the types typically found to host PFSs, it is most probable that the volumetric strain is expressed as porosity loss, but clearly other forms of strain are possible, including fracturing, stylolite formation and compaction bands (Hibsch et al., 2003; Fa\u00ff-Gomord et al., 2017). For simplicity, we therefore consider this type of fault growth as a form of differential compaction faulting, whereby purely vertical gravitational loading is partitioned by the low friction on the fault and leads to a component of slip on such a pre-defined fault.\nDifferential compaction faults can develop in a range of contexts but have previously been linked to lateral changes in compaction properties such as across carbonate reefs or channel sands encased in muddy sediments, or to differential compaction on the flanks of basement highs draped by muddy sediments (Powers, 1922; Carver, 1968; Labute and Gretener, 1969; O'Connor and Gretener, 1974; Gay Jr, 1989; Laubach et al., 1999). The addition here of a mechanism to produce differential compaction faulting clearly has fundamental implications for the growth of polygonal faults, as shown by our modelling, but it extends beyond PFSs to any fault that by virtue of its low residual friction perturbs the stress state related to vertical loading under gravity.\n\n\n4.2\nFault scaling relationships\nOne of the central arguments developed by Shin et al. (2010) in the first attempt to model polygonal fault kinematics was that extremely low bulk stiffnesses of the host medium would be required to achieve the displacement-height ratios recorded from natural systems. In contrast, our results suggest that the empirical scaling relationship between the maximum throw values and heights of polygonal faults (Shin et al., 2010) can be replicated via simple differential compaction across pre-existing faults with uniformly distributed residual friction values less than \u223c9\u00b0 hosted in fine-grained sediments with a range of compaction profiles (Fig. 5). Our results suggest that the accumulation of throw on polygonal faults is most sensitive to changes in the residual friction angle, and hence much of the scatter in global plots of throw versus fault height (Shin et al., 2010) may be due to variations in friction angle within a fault population. One caveat should be applied here: our model assumes an initial stage of fault nucleation and growth before gravitational loading dominates the strain accumulation, and some of the throw on any given fault should therefore be rightly ascribed to the initial stages of nucleation and propagation.\n\n\n4.3\nIncremental addition of displacement during fault growth\nWe have argued the case for syn-sedimentary growth of polygonal faults, whereby after an initial phase, the upper tip is constantly at or close to the sediment-water interface. This argument is founded in the many previous observations of PFSs in previous studies that have demonstrated growth packages, or anomalously high expansion indices or displacement gradients, or more tellingly, shown the upper tips to crop out as surface scarps (King and Cartwright, 2020, and references therein). Our model outputs consistently show that the locus of maximum throw at any increment in time migrates upwards in tandem with the general burial and addition of sediment layers to the upper boundary of the tier (Fig. 10). In short, as the tier grows vertically, the faults propagate upwards and the Tmax position also migrates upwards. The final position of the Tmax does not therefore coincide with a nucleation position in the tier as has been suggested (Watterson et al., 2000; Wrona et al., 2017; Turrini et al., 2017) but is a final snapshot of a transient, migratory process. The upward migration of the Tmax position with growth for polygonal faults was first suggested by Morgan et al. (2015), and this proposition is therefore confirmed by our modelling.\nOne other aspect of the gross kinematics of polygonal faults is that of the rate of accumulation of displacement. Until recently, this important parameter was unquantified for polygonal faults, but King and Cartwright (2020) were able to correlate markers from Ocean Drilling Project cores and from these measure displacement rates of the order of 1\u201310\u00a0m\/m.y. The throw rates derived from our models are consistent with those recorded from the upper tips of their surface-breaching polygonal faults in the V\u00f8ring Basin. It is worth noting that those faults are hosted in a tier with similar sedimentation rates to those used in our models, and it is tempting to speculate that displacement rates for faults undergoing some form of fault-perturbed differential compaction would most likely scale with sedimentation (loading) rates.\n\n\n4.4\nLimitations with the modelling\nOur modelling strategy did not attempt to replicate the three-dimensional complexity of intersecting polygonal fault geometries (Lonergan et al., 1998a) or heterogeneities between units that comprise a PFS tier (Cartwright et al., 2003; Verschuren, 2019). We characterised our models with a single continuous fault plane with a uniform residual friction angle over its entire surface. However, outcrop observations of polygonal faults show that the fault zones may comprise a multitude of smaller fractures and splays (Verschuren, 1990; Hibsch et al., 2003; Tewksbury et al., 2014; Fa\u00ff-Gomord et al., 2017; Verschuren, 2019) that would aggregate to give the appearance of a single plane at the resolution limits of seismic reflection data. These heterogeneities and fault intersections may explain the differences between the smoothly tapering throw profiles produced in our simulations (Fig. 19) and the jagged or stepped throw profiles recorded from polygonal faults imaged in seismic reflection data (Neagu et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2015; Turrini et al., 2017; Wrona et al., 2017). However, despite the relative homogeneity of our models compared to real PFS tiers, our results successfully reproduce the \u2018C-, M-, and L-shaped\u2019 geometries of polygonal fault throw profiles.\nOne of the main limitations of this study was that we did not explicitly investigate the role of overpressure. Elevated fluid pressure may facilitate the episodic growth of some polygonal faults at higher residual friction angles, and contribute to the growth of polygonal faults that span ultra-low permeability fine-grained units which may experience periods of compaction disequilibrium. If, for example, a polygonal fault ceases its growth because of an increase in the fault friction angle, then fluid pressure may build with increasing burial depth in undrained units until the fluid pressure acting on the fault plane reduces the effective mean stress sufficiently to facilitate frictional sliding at low shear stresses (Bolton et al., 1998; Watterson et al., 2000), thus reactivating fault growth. It is worth noting that overpressured mobile units found at the base of fine-grained sedimentary tiers may act as d\u00e9collement surfaces and these overpressured unit have been suggested as a means to nucleate PFS (Watterson et al., 2000). However, investigating the nucleation of PFS was beyond the scope of this study, which focused solely on the drivers of post-nucleation growth.\n\n\n4.5\nWider implications of the modelling results\nThe arrest and termination of activity on the constituent faults (\u2018death\u2019) making up a PFS may occur once the host sedimentary units no longer undergo differential volumetric strain. This may occur from the base of the tier upwards in a burial conveyor-belt like fashion, or in a single fossilisation phase. The slowing and ultimate cessation of differential volumetric strain may occur as frictional sliding is inhibited by an increase in the residual friction angle and\/or the slowing of volumetric change of the host units caused by lithification. The upward termination of a PFS may also occur because of a depositional facies change (Cartwright et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2014), and the growth of individual polygonal faults within a PFS may be inhibited by the intersection of neighbouring faults (Lonergan et al., 1998a). Fluctuations in the overburden loading rate (both erosional and depositional) may also influence the growth of PFSs. Faster sedimentation rates may increase the rate of compaction in drained conditions or drive overpressure in undrained conditions, therefore driving faster throw rates but also greater PFS tier heights (c.f. the empirical scaling relationship established by Shin et al. (2010)). Erosional events or depositional hiatuses may, on the other hand, limit the subsequent accrual of differential compaction until the pre-erosional maximum effective stress is reached following re-loading, in which time the material physical properties may have changed to inhibit further differential compaction. In summary, the temporal evolution of individual polygonal faults within a tier may be governed by many factors. However, our sensitivity analysis suggests that the growth of polygonal faults is primarily driven by low residual friction angles on dipping fault planes which facilitate differential compaction.\nIn summary, the results presented in this study strongly suggest that the growth of normal faults hosted in laterally-pinned sedimentary tiers can be solely facilitated by gravity-driven differential compaction at low residual friction angles. A gravity-driven differential compaction mechanism is likely the overarching driver of the growth of polygonal fault systems universally, where processes such as overpressure and diagenetically-induced volumetric reductions may act as secondary and tertiary contributing factors, respectively, to enhance or reactivate polygonal faults in some circumstances. In addition to the growth of PFSs, a differential compaction mechanism may also explain why up-dip extensional strains are consistently greater than down-dip compressional strains recorded in shallowly buried gravitational-slope fault systems found on continental shelves (Dalton et al., 2015).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, we modelled the growth of an isolated fault hosted within laterally-pinned conditions with respect to variable material compaction profiles, residual friction angles, and fault dip angles, using a suite of two-dimensional finite element forward models constructed in ELFEN, that coupled upward fault propagation with simultaneous sedimentation and compaction of unconsolidated fine-grained granular sediment. Our results show for the first time, that faults hosted in laterally-pinned conditions \u2013 such as those that host polygonal fault systems \u2013 can accumulate throw solely through gravity-driven differential compaction under realistic physical property and burial conditions.\nThe main findings of this study are:\n\n(1)\nPolygonal fault systems grow as the result of gravity-driven differential compaction at low residual friction angles.\n\n\n(2)\nMaximum throw (Tmax) as a percentage of fault height values recorded from polygonal fault systems globally (\u223c6%) can be achieved at standard fault dip angles and material property values typical of those recorded from fine-grained sediments at residual friction angles <9\u00b0.\n\n\n(3)\nThrow rates derived from our sensitivity analysis (0\u201310.45\u00a0m\/m.y.) are consistent with recently recorded ultra-slow throw rates from the upper tips of polygonal faults in the V\u00f8ring Basin, Norwegian Sea (1.4\u201310.9\u00a0m\/m.y).\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor statement\n\nJames J.

Generally, the fault trace is an element easy to identify as it corresponds to a discontinuity. However, the direction and sense of fault displacement is usually more difficult to determine as, in many cases, no kinematic criteria are available (e.g., striations on the fault plane). It is even more complicated to estimate the net slip as two homologous points on both fault blocks need to be known. Nevertheless, it is common to quickly classify faults according to the offset we observe, even in the absence of clear kinematic criteria. For example, if a fault crops out on a vertical slope or cliff and the same layer appears at a higher elevation in the hanging wall than in the footwall, we conclude that the fault is reverse, while if the layer is located at a lower elevation in the hanging wall than in the footwall, we assume that the fault is normal. If on a geological map the fault hanging wall is formed by older rocks than those in the footwall, we conclude that the fault is reverse, while if they are younger, we assume that it is a normal fault. Thus, we usually base our fault classification on the observed separation of planar markers, in this case bedding, i.e., the distance between two parts of a horizon disrupted by a fault measured in a particular direction. These deductions are correct when the displaced marker is a horizontal surface before fault generation or it strikes to the same direction than the fault, however, when the planar marker had a previous dip and its strike is different from that of the fault, these deductions may be incorrect, and therefore, a classification based on separation may lead to incorrect structural interpretations (Fig. 1\n). This matter is particularly sensitive in the case of seismic profiles as data are 2D and it is difficult to obtain kinematic indicators. The concepts of slip and separation are well known from classical works of the past century (e.g., Reid et al., 1913; Straley, 1934; Crowell, 1959; Billings, 1972) and they have been extensively discussed in most Structural Geology books. One of the most interesting contributions on the separation and slip in faults is that of Ragan (2009). This author proposed constructing fault plane views in order to visualize the geometrical effects of the displacement and made an analysis of separation of a planar marker versus the cut-off line of the planar marker on the fault plane and the slip vector.\nWorking on coastal outcrops of Lower Jurassic rocks in the Asturian Basin, NW Iberian Peninsula, where some faults cut and offset inclined layers and kinematic criteria are available, we recognised faults whose separation disagrees with slip. This motivated us to recall this topic and discuss these relationships, create a tool to make easier the analysis of the relationship between slip and separation, and illustrate these situations using field examples. The tool consists of graphs relating the angle between the cut-off line of a surface on the fault plane and the slip vector. In addition, we have developed a Python script that plots field data on the graphs presented in this paper and constructs simple geological maps and sections across the faults, as well as fault plane views as proposed in Ragan (2009). Our analysis applies to faults whose motion does not involve rotation of the fault blocks, and is based on the current disposition of the elements displaced by the fault, but it does not consider whether the final disposition is due to a single fault motion event or due to fault reactivation.\nThe Asturian Basin, located in the northwestern portion of the Iberian Peninsula, is a Permian-Mesozoic extensional basin partially inverted during a Cenozoic contractional event. The Mesozoic extensional events led to folds related to normal faults, while the Cenozoic contractional event, which took place during the Alpine orogenesis, is characterised, among other structures, by reverse and strike-slip faults superimposed to Mesozoic structures (Lepvrier and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1990; Uzkeda, 2013; Uzkeda et al., 2013, 2016). The angular relationships between the Mesozoic folds and the Cenozoic faults are very varied because the Mesozoic structures strike NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W. The Asturian coast contains exceptional top-views and cross-sectional exposures of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin by the Cantabrian Sea (Mart\u00edn et al., 2013; Uzkeda et al., 2018, 2022). The excellent quality outcrops combined with the use of traditional and digital geological mapping, as well as the construction and interpretation of virtual outcrop models (Xu et al., 2000) of this region has allowed us to perform a high-resolution geological analysis. This approach has provided measurements and observations at different scales and bed-by-bed resolution, so that we are able to identify the same layers and structures in both fault blocks. This makes it possible to determine without any uncertainty the type of fault and estimate the dip and strike separations, i.e., the distance of formerly adjacent beds on either side of a fault surface, measured along the dip of the fault or measured along strike of the fault respectively.\nThe most common way to proceed in order to determine the different cases resulting from the interaction of two elements consists of modifying one element, the other, and finally both. Although apparently in the study of relationships between faults and layers there are only two elements, unfortunately, there are too many parameters to be considered, both in the case of faults (orientation, type of fault according to its displacement, magnitude of displacement, etc.) and in the case of tilted\/folded layers (orientation of beds, axial surfaces and fold axes, interlimb angle, fold geometry, etc.), to analyse their effect one by one. In this paper, we will check how the variation of the parameters, which we consider most important, influences our perception of the type of fault. First, we will examine a simple and, in our opinion, very illustrative case, since it may be relatively common for a geologist to map faults in the field that cut and offset layers with a certain previous dip. Next, we will explore what happens when faults cut and offset folds. We will show different implications derived from the modification of the different parameters related to faults and layers using sections and geological maps, since they are two of the most used techniques in Geology to represent the geometry of geological bodies.\n\n\n2\nFaults displacing previously inclined layers\nIn this section, we analyse the most important parameters that influence the dip and strike fault separation that one can see in cross section and in map respectively, as well as derived implications from variation of these parameters. Finally, we present a perfectly bounded field example and two theoretical examples.\n\n2.1\nGeological cross-sections and maps\nIn a region where layers exhibit a normal polarity and are horizontal or their strike is the same than that of the fault, the sense of dip separation shown in a section across the fault is consistent with the slip of the fault. That is, in dipping faults, reverse faults place hanging wall older rocks over footwall younger rocks, normal faults place hanging wall younger rocks over footwall older rocks, and strike-slip faults cause no dip separation. However, in those cases where bedding was tilted before fault development and its strike is not parallel to that of the fault, the fault may show confusing dip separations (Fig. 1). Thus, a reverse fault may appear as a normal fault or vice versa, and a strike-slip fault may appear as a reverse or normal fault. To show how the fault dip separation would look like in cross sections perpendicular to the fault strike, we have constructed a graph (Fig. 2\nb). In this graph, we have represented the different types of faults according to their kinematics based on the pitch of the net-slip vector (or in other words, the pitch of linear kinematic indicators, such as fault striations, on the fault surface) as a function of bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane. The parameters used in this graph are illustrated in Fig. 2a. The analysis of this graph has allowed us to draw the conclusions set out below.\n\n1)\nIf the slip vector and the bedding cut-off lines are parallel, any fault, irrespective of the type of fault (reverse, normal, strike-slip or oblique), will appear as a strike-slip fault in cross section, i.e., same age hanging wall and footwall rocks will be located at the same height, and therefore, the fault dip separation will be zero (Fig. 1a, blue lines in Fig. 2b). In all other cases, however, the faults will show normal or reverse dip separation.\n\n\n2)\nDip-slip, oblique-slip and strike-slip faults with a normal component will show normal dip separation except when the slip vector pitches in the same direction than the bedding cut-off lines at a smaller angle (measured from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) than that of the bedding cut-off lines. Similarly, dip-slip, oblique-slip and strike-slip faults with a reverse component will show reverse dip separation except when the slip vector pitches in the same direction than the bedding cut-off lines at a smaller angle than that of the bedding cut-off lines (Figs. 1b and 2b).\n\n\n\nSimilarly to cross-sections, in geological maps there are also cases where the fault strike separation disagrees with the fault slip. We have constructed a graph to show how the fault strike separation would look like in maps (Fig. 2c). In this graph, we have represented the different types of faults according to their kinematics based on the pitch of the net-slip vector (i.e., the pitch of linear kinematic indicators such as fault striations) versus the pith of the bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane. Different situations, briefly described below, occur.\n\n1)\nIf the fault slip vector and the bedding cut-off lines are parallel, any type of fault (reverse, normal, strike-slip and oblique) will show no strike separation, so that it will appear on the map as if the fault caused no movement (Fig. 1a). In all other cases, faults will display strike separations other than zero (Fig. 2c).\n\n\n2)\nApart from the case described above, faults will show strike separations consistent with fault slip except when the fault slip vector pitches in the same direction than the bedding cut-off lines at a greater angle than that of the bedding cut-off lines, then the fault strike separation will disagree with the fault slip. Thus, a fault with a left-lateral component will exhibit a right strike separation on the map, whereas a fault with a right-lateral component of motion will appear as a fault with left strike separation on the map (Figs. 1c and 2c).\n\n\n\nTo visualize the particular case of pure strike-slip faults, we have created a diagram including maps and cross sections that takes into account fault dip and bedding dip, and whether faults are right-lateral or left-lateral (Fig. 3\n).\nTwo particular cases need to be explained separately.\n\n1)\nIn relation to the dip of the faults. Vertical faults have neither hanging wall nor footwall. Fault block motion in vertical faults is usually identified using cardinal points instead of the classical classification of normal or reverse faults (although they can still be labelled as right or left-lateral faults), and therefore, the graphs in Fig. 2 are not appropriate for vertical faults. Horizontal faults, although they do have hanging wall and footwall, their movement refers to cardinal points instead of the classical classification of normal, reverse, etc. faults. Again, the graphs in Fig. 2 do not seem to be appropriate for horizontal faults. To be able to plot these faults in Fig. 2 graphs we suggest assuming that vertical faults are not strictly vertical, but have a dip of 89.9\u00b0, while horizontal faults would be assigned a dip of 0.1\u00b0. Since natural fault surfaces are usually not perfect planes but rather irregular surfaces, this assumption seems reasonable.\n\n\n2)\nIn relation to the orientation of the layers. When the layers are parallel to the observation plane, i.e., to the section plane in the case of geological cross-sections or to the map plane in the case of geological maps, then different layers appear in both fault blocks. Unfortunately, in these cases it is impossible to determine neither the dip separation nor the strike separation, and therefore, the graphs in Fig. 2 cannot be used.\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the influence of different parameters on the magnitude of dip separation, we will consider a simple case of a vertical strike-slip fault that offsets a previously dipping bed whose dip ranges from more than 0\u00b0 to less than 90\u00b0. Since it is impossible to examine all possible situations, we will vary three different parameters and analyse qualitatively the behaviour of these variations. To do so, we will use a dip separation versus strike separation graph for different pitch values of bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane (Fig. 4\n). The parameters we will modify are the angle between the fault strike and the bedding strike, the dip of the layers, and the fault slip (or separation, as it is a pure strike-slip fault and its strike separation coincides with slip). The conclusions obtained are listed below.\n\n1)\nWhen the angle between the bedding strike and the fault strike decreases, keeping constant the bedding dip and the fault slip, then the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines decreases and the dip separation we see in cross section decreases as well (path illustrated by green arrows in Fig. 4a and b).\n\n\n2)\nWhen the bedding dip increases, keeping constant the angle between the bedding strike and the fault strike as well as the fault slip, then the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines increases and the dip separation we see in cross section also increases (path illustrated by blue arrows in Fig. 4a and b).\n\n\n3)\nWhen the fault slip increases, keeping constant the angle between the bedding strike and the fault strike as well as the bedding dip, the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines remains constant but the dip separation viewed in cross section increases (path illustrated by red arrows in Fig. 4a and b).\n\n\n\nThe conclusions explained above derive from cases in which we only vary one of the parameters and the rest remain constant. However, from the graph in Fig. 4a, conclusions can be drawn for cases in which more than one parameter varies. For instance, for the same increase in strike separation, the larger the pitch of the cut-off lines on the fault surface the larger the dip separation increase.\n\n\n2.2\nField example\nThe selected field example is located in the southeastern part of Pe\u00f1arrubia Beach, Gij\u00f3n (Asturias) by the Cantabrian Sea (Fig. 5\na). The Jurassic rocks that crop out in the Pe\u00f1arrubia Beach belong to the northern part of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin and consist of alternations of limestones and marls. In this region, mapped in Beroiz et al. (1972), Guti\u00e9rrez Claverol et al. (2002), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014) and Odriozola (2016), there is an E-W to WNW-ESE fault, whose trace is approximately rectilinear in map view and reaches a few hectometres length along strike (Fig. 5b). The fault surface dips steeply to the SSW (Fig. 6\na), although locally it can dip to the NNE (Fig. 5d). This fault offsets a N\u2013S syncline causing a right strike separation on the geological map (Fig. 5b). Low-pitch slickensides (18\u00b0 W) recognised on the fault surface indicate right-lateral slip with a small normal component (Fig. 5d). To estimate the net-slip value and its pitch on the fault surface, one fault-parallel section across the hanging wall and another across the footwall have been constructed both adjacent to the fault (dashed blue and red lines in Fig. 5b). Both sections have been overlapped using a reference point of known coordinates in order to construct an Allan map (Allan, 1989) (Fig. 5e). The hinge of the syncline developed at the same horizon in both fault blocks has been taken as homologous points in the Allan map. The distance between these two homologous points on the Allan map is the net slip and its dip is the pitch of the net slip. The net slip obtained is 38.7\u00a0m, the strike slip is 38.1\u00a0m, the dip slip is about 4.4\u00a0m and the pitch of the net slip is almost 9.5\u00b0 to the W, i.e., it is a strike-slip fault. The net-slip pitch and the fault motion sense calculated using homologous points on both fault blocks depicted in the Allan map (Fig. 5e) coincide with the pitch and direction of movement deduced from the slickensides measured on the fault plane in the field (Fig. 5d). The calculated net-slip pitch and the pitch measured in the field using kinematic indicators are not identical because the pitch of the slickensides corresponds to values measured at specific locations and neither the fault surface is a perfect plane nor the slickensides are perfectly rectilinear, and because the calculated net-slip corresponds to the final displacement vector that may be the result of the sum of different fault motion pulses with similar orientation slickensides but not strictly parallel. Thus, both the theoretical calculations and the kinematic indicators, clearly show that this fault is an almost pure right-lateral strike-slip fault with a slight normal component. However, on the coastal cliff, which is approximately vertical and almost perpendicular to the fault strike, this fault appears as a reverse fault with a dip separation of approximately 1.5\u00a0m (Fig. 6a). The calculated pitch of the net slip, the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane (estimated on the equal-area projection illustrated in Fig. 5d using bedding and fault field measurements), as well as the calculated value of strike separation, have been plotted on the graphs in Figs. 2 and 4. The graphs in Fig. 2, the map and cross section outputs of the Python script (Figs. 5c and 6b) and the diagrams shown in Fig. 3 confirm that the fault analysed, despite being an almost pure right-lateral strike-slip fault with a slight normal component, should appear as a reverse fault in cross section, while the graph in Fig. 4a and the cross section derived from the Phyton script (Fig. 6b) confirm that its dip separation should be around 1.5\u00a0m as shown in the field photograph depicted in Fig. 6a.\n\n\n2.3\nTheoretical examples\nIn order to show examples of faults whose motion does not cause displacement of the layers on the map, or causes apparent displacement of the layers on the map contrary to the actual fault motion, geological cross-sections and maps of two theoretical examples constructed with the Python script developed are presented below.\nThe first example is a left-lateral fault with a slight normal component (equal-area plot in Fig. 7\na). The bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane are almost parallel to the net slip, as shown by the plot of the fault data on the graphs in Fig. 2b and c. This causes that, regardless of the magnitude of motion along the fault, this fault does not offset the layers neither in the geological cross-section nor in the geological map (Fig. 7a).\nThe second example is a right-lateral fault with a slight normal component (equal-area plot in Fig. 7b). The pitch of the bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane is greater than the pitch of the net slip, as shown by the data plotted on the graphs in Fig. 2b and c. Thus, although in the geological cross-section the fault shows a small normal dip separation consistent with the actual net-slip, on the geological map it exhibits a left strike separation although the fault is really right-lateral (Fig. 7b).\n\n\n\n3\nFaults displacing previously folded layers\n\n3.1\nGeological maps\nImagine a region where cylindrical folds, with axes parallel to the strike of the axial planes, are cut and offset by a fault whose strike is parallel to the axial plane strike and the dip of both the axial planes and the fault are constant along strike. In this particular situation, the fault maintains the same character along its entire trace, i.e., the geological map shows a fault in which the oldest rocks are always in one fault block and the youngest rocks in the other. However, in other cases there may be segments of the same fault where the oldest rocks are in one fault block and segments where the oldest rocks are in the other fault block. To illustrate these situations in map view, we have assumed that the folds have a kink-chevron geometry and we have constructed a graph (Fig. 8\n) in which the x axis represents different types of faults according to their kinematics based on the pitch of the slip vector (i.e., kinematic indicators), and the y axis is the pitch of the axial planes cut-off lines on the fault plane. The following conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of this graph.\n\n1)\nRegardless of the type of fault considered, when the slip vector and the axial plane cut-off lines are parallel, the faults maintain the same character along strike on a geological map (blue lines in Fig. 8).\n\n\n2)\nIn all other cases, regardless of the fault type, the faults may have segments where older rocks are located in one fault block and younger rocks in the other, and segments where the opposite situation occurs. Those fault segments where older rocks are in the hanging wall and younger ones in the footwall exhibit an apparent reverse displacement, whereas those fault segments where younger rocks are in the hanging wall and older ones in the footwall exhibit an apparent normal displacement (Fig. 8). In the case of strictly vertical faults, since there is no hanging wall and footwall, we could only speak of younger or older rocks in one or the other fault block.\n\n\n\nThere are many parameters that influence the width of the apparently reverse fault segments and that of the apparently normal fault segments along the same fault, and therefore, it is difficult to consider all the different situations. Thus, we propose to explore a simple case; a fold train formed by equally spaced anticlines and synclines with horizontal fold axes and vertical axial surfaces cut and offset by a pure strike-slip fault. The folds are cylindrical, their geometrical features are identical and the topographical surface is flat. The results will be shown using a graph which relates the width of the apparently reverse and apparently normal fault segments versus the fault strike separation for different distances between fold hinges measured parallel to the fault (Fig. 9\n). The basic parameters we will modify are the angle between the fault strike and the folds, the fault displacement, and the distance between fold hinges measured parallel to the fault trace. The results derived from the graph analysis are briefly explained below.\n\n1)\nIf we keep constant the fault strike separation but the angle between the fault strike and the folds decreases, then the distance between fold hinges measured parallel to the fault trace increases, so that the width of the apparently reverse and normal fault segments increases as well (path illustrated by green arrows in Fig. 9a and b).\n\n\n2)\nWhen the distance between fold hinges increases, keeping constant the fault strike separation, as well as the angle between the fault strike and the folds, then the width of the apparently reverse and normal fault segments increases (path illustrated by blue arrows in Fig. 9a and b).\n\n\n3)\nWhen the fault strike separation increases, keeping constant the angle between the fault strike and the folds, as well as the distance between fold hinges, the width of the apparently reverse and normal fault segments remains constant, except when the fault strike separation is a multiple of twice the distance between fold hinges; in this particular case the fault appears to have no strike separation (path illustrated by red arrows in Fig. 9a and b).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nField example\nThe fault we will analyse in this section is located a few hundred metres farther north than the fault described above (Fig. 5a). It has an E-W to WNW-ESE strike and very steep dip both towards the N and S (Fig. 10\n), predominantly towards the S, and cuts and offsets a NNE-SSW fold train. This fault displays a slightly corrugated map trace and hectometric length along strike (Fig. 10a). The low pitch slickensides identified on the fault surface, together with some right-lateral shear zones, indicate right-lateral fault motion (Fig. 10b). According to the geological map (Fig. 10a), the axial trace of the westernmost NNE-SSW fold is curved near the fault, which is interpreted as a drag fold consistent with a right-lateral fault movement. We have calculated the coordinates of the intersection point between the fault and an axis of an anticline developed in a horizon located in the north fault block, and the coordinates of the intersection point between the fault and the same fold developed in the same horizon in the south fault block. Since these two points correspond to homologous points in both fault blocks, this has made it possible to determine the fault net-slip, its pitch and the fault motion sense. The calculated net-slip is 33.5\u00a0m, the strike slip is almost 33.5\u00a0m, the dip slip is slightly greater than 1\u00a0m and the net-slip pitch is almost 2.3\u00b0 (Fig. 10c); thus, the fault is a strike-slip fault, in particular a right-lateral fault. The net-slip pitch and the sense of fault movement obtained using homologous points on the two fault blocks (Fig. 10c), coincide with the pitch and direction of movement obtained from the kinematic indicators measured in the field (Fig. 10b). As in the case of the fault described above, the calculated pitch of the net slip and that of the kinematic indicators measured in the field are not identical because the slickensides have been measured in different locations and the fault surface is not a perfect plane, and because the calculated net-slip is the final displacement vector that may result from the sum of different fault motion pulses with not strictly parallel slickensides. The geological map shows that there are fault segments in which younger rocks are located in the northern block, i.e., the footwall, while older rocks are located in the southern block, i.e., the hanging wall, and therefore, the fault would behave as an apparent reverse fault (Fig. 11\n). However, there are segments where the opposite situation occurs, i.e., older rocks located in the northern fault block (footwall) are directly in contact with younger rocks located in the southern fault block (hanging wall), and thus the fault would behave apparently as a normal fault (Fig. 11). The segments where the fault acts as an apparent reverse fault and those where it acts as an apparent normal fault are separated by null points (term adapted from Williams et al., 1989, originally applied to inversion tectonics) in which the outcropping layers in the northern and southern fault blocks have the same age, and therefore, no strike separation occurs at these points. The calculated pitch of the net slip, pitch of the axial plane cut-off lines on the fault plane, the strike separation and the distance between fold hinges displaced by this fault have been plotted on the graphs in Figs. 8 and 9. On the one hand, the graph in Fig. 8 verifies that this fault shows apparently reverse and apparently normal segments along strike, as expected, since the slip vector and the axial plane cut-off lines are not parallel. On the other hand, the graph in Fig. 9 tells us that the width of the apparently reverse and apparently normal fault segments should be slightly greater than 30\u00a0m in the eastern portion of the fault and slightly greater than 10\u00a0m in the western part of the fault, as shown in the geological map (Fig. 10a).\n\n\n\n4\nApplications\nFrom our point of view, the graphs presented here can be used in different ways.\n\n1)\nAs a tool to improve our structural interpretations in cases where observations are apparently contradictory. For example, if we see a reverse fault on a slope and a fault with strike-slip kinematic indicators on a flat region but the outcrops between the slope and the flat area are covered by vegetation, we may conclude that they are two different faults. Alternatively, if we see a strike-slip fault in a flat region and its continuation on the slope becomes a reverse fault, we may conclude that it is a reactivated fault. In these cases, the graphs presented can help us to determine whether they are indeed two different faults or they are the same fault in the first example, and whether it is a reactivated fault or it fits an interpretation based on a single movement in the second example.\n\n\n2)\nFrom the predictive point of view in regions where we know that faults cut and offset previously tilted and\/or folded layers. Thus, if we have information in geological map format as well as fault kinematic indicators, the graphs can help us to predict what type of fault dip separation will be expected in geological cross-sections. In the same way, if the information we have comes from sections across faults based on outcrops in road slopes, cliffs, mountain slopes, etc. the graphs can be useful to construct the geological map since they will allow us to infer what type of strike separation will be expected for the faults. If fault kinematic indicators are not available in the study area, the graphs could be used to constrain possible pitches of the net slip as long as the orientation of the fault plane and the layers, as well as geological cross-sections and map views of the faults, are available. This exercise could be also carried out using 3D seismic data. The procedure would consist of calculating the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines from the orientation of the layers and the fault. Next, determine the type of fault dip separation in cross section (normal, reverse or no separation) and the type of fault strike separation on the map (left, right or no separation). Next, a horizontal line corresponding to the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines should be drawn on the graphs of Fig. 2b and c only in the fields whose type of dip and strike separation coincides with the type of dip and strike separations determined. The horizontal line segments whose position is identical in both graphs will give us possible values of net-slip pitch and possible types of faults.\n\n\n3)\nTo check whether in a region the layers were tilted and\/or folded before fault development. For instance, if the kinematic indicators tell us that a fault is a strike-slip fault, but the same fault appears as a reverse fault in cross section or it displays apparent reverse or normal segments along its map trace, the graphs might be used to check whether the type of fault determined based on the kinematic indicators is consistent with the type of dip and strike separation observed in the geological cross-sections and maps. If so, this confirms the presence of tilted and\/or folded layers before fault development. If not, another hypothesis needs to be formulated.\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nA correct classification of faults, based on their kinematics, requires a three-dimensional thinking. However, data are commonly obtained in two dimensions, and therefore, it is necessary to analyse geological maps and cross-sections when trying to unravel the structural history of a region. This type of exercise is usually carried out to decipher the fault type when no kinematic indicators are available. However, this analysis is not usually performed when kinematic elements are available, such as fault striations, homologous points on both fault blocks, etc., since they provide us incontestable information about the movement along faults, and therefore, we are generally satisfied with this information. What we want to emphasise here is that we recommend to carry out analyses of geological maps and sections across faults also in those cases where kinematic indicators associated with fault motion are available, as both are complementary techniques and may supply additional information.\nFurthermore, although geological maps and sections are very old techniques, this work shows that they are still essential tools not only for the representation, visualization and understanding of the structure of a region, but also for deciphering the occurrence of deformational events prior to the development of faults.\nThis work is a first approach to the problem of apparently confusing situations in faults that cut and offset previously tilted and\/or folded layers. However, to understand the full spectrum of possibilities there are still many parameters to be explored, such as the variation of fault slip along dip and\/or strike, different geometries of folds or folds with inverted limbs amongst other parameters.\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nMarta Mag\u00e1n: Methodology, Software, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization.\n\nJosep Poblet: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing - original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.\n\nMayte Bulnes: Methodology, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.\n\n","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nMicroscopic kinematic analysis is a common technique in structural geology to determine paleostress strain\/stress fields from outcrops (e.g. Etchecopar et al., 1981; Armijo et al., 1982; Ramsay and Huber, 1983, 1987; Reches, 1987; Angelier, 1990, Capote et al., 1990), which has evolved including complex fractal geometries (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2005), and has led to the development of numerical models beyond the classical view of the Anderson's fracture model (\u017dalohar and Vrabec, 2010). However, the paleostress reconstruction is constrained from the geological structures, which are commonly folded and faulted, determining the spatial distribution of the fault-slip data (Amrouch et al., 2010). Microstructural analysis can be applied in geologic gas storages, complementing it with other strain\/strain methods, such as earthquake focal mechanism solutions or calcite twin analysis (e.g. Lacombe, 2007).\nUnderground geologic gas storage sites are conceived as long-lived facilities, while geophysical monitoring is an essential practice for keeping industrial operations safe in the long-term future. One of the main concerns in underground gas storages is the possibility of triggering earthquakes. Preventing induced earthquakes during the injection\/withdrawal gas operations needs a knowledge of several geological parameters such as exiting fault and fracture networks, present-day stress and pressure conditions, geomechanical constraints regarding rock failure, total gas volume stored, and daily gas flow of the injected gas, among others.\nThe classical microstructural analysis of striation measurements on fault planes provides an economical and accessible method for estimating the paleostress\/-strain fields of geological reservoirs (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020), acting as a key parameter to understand the induced seismicity potential. Among others, the Right-Dihedral and the Slip Model methods (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020) can be applied to identify the strain field, whereas the stress field can be determined from the analysis of earthquake focal mechanism solutions. Hence, the coefficient of reactivation for fault sets affecting the reservoir can be determined, according to their agreement with the strain field, and their role in the reservoir permeability and as leakage pathways.\nThe geologic gas storage of Yela (Guadalajara, Central Spain, Fig. 1\n) is operating since 2012. It is a strategic storage facility for natural gas, which is stored and withdrawn according to the seasonal demand of the Spanish energy market. The Yela storage site is located in an intraplate tectonic zone, where no relevant earthquakes were recorded before the gas operations started. The Spanish Seismic Network, operated by the Geographical Institute of Spain (www.ign.es), have been recording and collecting earthquakes from 1985 with a magnitude of completeness of Mc\u00a0=\u00a01.5, where Mc is the minimum magnitude above which all earthquakes within the studied area are reliably. A set of micro earthquakes (n\u00a0=\u00a0141; M\u00a0<\u00a02.3) have been triggered since the starting of the injection\/extraction operations in 2012 in the influence area of the injection operations (a few kilometres).\nOn the other hand, the regional tectonic stress field in Yela was extrapolated from a few data of small-sized (3 > M\u00a0>\u00a04.5) intraplate earthquakes located in the vicinity (50\u00a0km away, Herraiz et al., 2000; Giner-Robles et al., 2012). More extensive studies of the strain\/stress field could help to understand the injected fluid interaction with the recorded microseismicity, the fault reactivation, and therefore, prevent a future seismic occurrence. Moreover, the strain\/stress determination facilitates earthquake hazard information applicable to other sub-surface injection operations, such as oil and gas production or CO2 storages (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020).\nThe aim of this work is to determine the potential induced seismicity at the Yela gas storage site, the role of the strain\/stress field, and those fault sets prone to move and act as leakage pathways. In this way, we have analysed the microscopic kinematic data from fault-slip slickensides and the macroscopic and regional strain\/stress field derived from earthquake focal mechanism solutions. In total, 24 outcrops with 375 slip data were measured and analysed. We have estimated the potential fault sets reactivated under the current stress\/strain field, and their role as leaking pathways for the injected gas. Finally, we have studied the induced seismicity during the injection\/withdrawal operations at Yela site. Our results show small clusters of induced earthquakes during the winter injection operations, lasting from November to February. These seismic clusters appeared for the first time in 2012 coinciding with the starting gas operations, and appeared annually until 2021. Although the gas storage facility is working at its maximum capacity, the recorded induced earthquake activities have decreased in frequency and magnitude over the last period from 2017 to 2021.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe underground natural gas storage facility of Yela is located in the northeastern extent of the Madrid Basin, central Spain (Fig. 1a). The Cenozoic Madrid Basin is bordered by the intraplate mountain range Central System to the north and the fold and thrust belt Iberian Chain to the northeast developed during the Cenozoic (Fig. 1a). The basin was filled and deformed during Cenozoic times due to the folding of the Iberian Peninsula lithosphere related to the convergence between Iberia and Eurasian plates (Cloetingh et al., 2002). The Central System consists of intraplate thick-skinned basement pop-up oriented E-W to NE-SW, of Oligocene-lower Miocene in age, while some structures were reactivated during the upper Miocene-Pliocene (de Vicente et al., 2007). However, to the NE, the compressional deformation is distributed by syntectonic fault-propagation folds (de Vicente and Mu\u00f1oz-Mart\u00edn, 2013), induced by SE-directed basement-involved thrust faults (Fig. 1c). To the east, the Madrid Basin is connected with the Iberian Chain, which consists of a NW-SE intraplate deformation belt, formed during the Cenozoic inversion of the Iberian Basin (e.g. Guimer\u00e0 et al., 2004). The occurrence of NW-SE folds is related to basement-involved thrusts and positive flower structures, partially covered by the Cenozoic sediments of the Madrid Basin (Fig. 1c).\nThe Cenozoic Madrid Basin lies was deposited on a sedimentary cover consisting of clastic Permian-Triassic succession followed by Middle to Upper Triassic carbonates including evaporitic sequences. The Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sequences are missing in the area. This omission is related to the no deposition beyond the current mountain ranges, which in turn were Mesozoic rift areas. The sedimentary record of the Madrid Basin is rather continuous from the Late Cretaceous to the late Miocene, deposited in continental environments and showing different lithology such as sandstones, claystones, marls, limestones or gypsum.\nThe Oligocene-Lower Miocene sedimentary infilling coincide with the maximum tectonic activity at the basin borders, which produced progressive discordances associated with folds of different orientation (de Vicente and Mu\u00f1oz-Mart\u00edn, 2013 and references therein). The main tectonic structure in the area consists of a large SE-directed crustal-scale thrust, which puts in contact the southern margin of the Central System with the Madrid Basin (Fig. 1b). This regional structure is represented by a basement flexure determined by a NE-trending axis, which is related with instrumental seismicity of magnitude maximum as M\u00a0=\u00a04.2 (Escopete earthquake, 7th June of 2007), and shallow earthquakes (<10\u00a0km) with normal focal mechanisms (Giner-Robles et al., 2012). This basement flexure is in agreement with the regional stress\/strain tensor defined by Herraiz et al. (2000).\nThe geologic gas storage of Yela is an underground natural gas and strategic reservoir. This reservoir consists of a saline aquifer in a carbonate succession, 8\u00a0km long with a NE-SW trend, and covering an area of 25\u00a0km2. The depth of the reservoir ranges between 2,300 and 2,550\u00a0m, and the total storage volume is ca 6.25\u00a0km3. The lithology of the reservoir is represented by the \u201cSanta B\u00e1rbara\u201d formation, which consists of Cretaceous carbonates, mainly dolostones (Conian-Santonian) affected by a diffuse fracture network, overlain and sealed by evaporitic facies. The structural trap consists of a NE-SW fault-propagation fold (Fig. 1), accommodated on a SE-directed thrust, NE-SW oriented (Figs. 1a and 4).\n\n\n3\nMethods and rationale\nStress and strain fields play a relevant role in the permeability of underground gas reservoirs. The reservoir is affected by the tectonic field, especially when increasing gas pressure that might promote leakage (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020). The estimation of 3D fracture networks relative to the active stress and strain fields within the reservoir allows to prevent the induced seismicity related to fluid injection or withdrawal by deploying seismic arrays.\nThe application of the common techniques of paleostress analysis in field outcrops (i.e. Etchecopar et al., 1981; Reches, 1983; Angelier, 1990; Delvaux and Sperner, 2003), provides the local strain\/stress field evolution through time in a reservoir (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020). These techniques estimate the stress\/strain fields by measuring grooves and slickensides on fault planes (Reches, 1983), among other displacement indicators. The strain tensor is an ellipsoid defined by the orientation of the principal axes, which can be projected in the plane, ey\u00a0=\u00a0maximum horizontal shortening, ex\u00a0=\u00a0minimum horizontal shortening, and ez\u00a0=\u00a0vertical strain, and the shape of the ellipsoid. This method assumes that the fault slip-vector defines a common strain tensor within a homogeneous tectonic setting. We assume that the strain field is homogeneous in space and time and the number of faults activated is greater than 5 (orthorhombic tensor), while the slip vector is parallel to the maximum shear stress (\u03c4). Here we have used the horizontal shortening, a 2D projection of the strain tensor (Ramsay and Huber, 1983) to define the strain tensor affecting the geologic gas storage. In this work, we have performed an analysis of the fault kinematics, by measuring slickenfibers on fault planes (dip, dip-direction, and rake), in several outcrops in the surroundings of the reservoir (20\u00a0km away from the Yela gas reservoir). The paleostrain inversion method has been applied in fault planes present in Cretaceous and Neogene successions (late Miocene to present-day).\n\n3.1\nThe right-dihedral model for paleostrain analysis\n\nRamsay (1967) pointed out that strain is mainly a matter of geometry. The Right-Dihedral method (RD) is a semi-quantitative method based on the overlapping of compressional and extensional zones by using a stereographic plot. The result is an interferogram plot, which defines the tectonic strain-regime. This method provides robust results for conjugate fault sets with different dip values for the same strain tensor, drawing different plot symmetry (dihedron) according to the type of the strain tensor (extensional, compressional and strike-slip). This method was originally defined by Angelier and Mechler (1977), as a geometric method, adjusting the measured fault-slip data (slickensides) in agreement with the theoretical models for extension and compressive fault-slip. We can constrain the regions of maximum compression and extension related to the strain regime in the final dihedron.\n\n\n3.2\nThe Slip Model for the paleostrain analysis\nThe Slip Model (SM) is based on the Navier-Coulomb fracturing criteria (Reches, 1983), taking the Anderson model solution (Anderson, 1951; Simpson, 1997). The Anderson model is based on the quantitative parameters of the tensor shape parameter with the internal frictional angle for rocks (\u03c6, Capote et al., 1991). This model shows the relationships between the tensor shape, \u03c6 and the direction cosines for the striation on the fault plane (Capote et al., 1991).\n\n\n3.3\nThe K\u2019 strain diagram\nThe K\u2032-diagram (Kaverina et al., 1996; \u00c1lvarez-G\u00f3mez, 2019) is a triangular representation based on the fault-slip, which discriminates between strike-slip and dip-slip tectonic patterns. The triangular graph is based on the equal-areal representation of the main axes, T, N or B and P (T: tensile; N or B: neutral; P: pressure axes). This method was originally performed for earthquake focal mechanism solutions by using the focal parameter, nodal plane and rake (Kaverina et al., 1996). P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2020) introduced the use of the strain tensor shape combined with the K\u2032-diagram, and divided the diagram in 7 different zones according to the type of fault: (1) pure normal, (2) pure reverse and (3) pure strike-slip, (4) reverse strike-slip, (5) strike-slip with reverse component, (6) normal strike-slip, and (7) strike-slip faults with normal component. Strike-slip faults are defined by small pitch values (p\u00a0<\u00a025\u00b0), with dip close to a vertical plane (\u03b2\u00a0>\u00a075\u00b0). High pitch values (p\u00a0>\u00a060\u00b0) are related to normal or\/reverse fault-slip vectors. Extensional faults show ey in vertical whereas compressional faults show ey in a horizontal plane. The advantage of using this diagram is the direct assignation of the fault type and the tectonic regime, as well as the strain axes relationship. Hence, the K\u2032-diagram classifies the type of fault according to the strain tensor.\n\n\n3.4\nPaleostrain analysis\n\nP\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2020) carried out a first approach to the application of the paleostrain analysis in the surroundings of geologic carbon storage (GCS) in Hontom\u00edn (central Spain). They performed the analysis in a 20\u00a0km radius circle, centered in the Hontom\u00edn reservoir. This circle size was estimated taking into account active faulting with the capacity of triggering earthquakes with magnitudes up to M 6, which show a surface rupture of tens of kilometers length (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994). Verdon et al. (2015) pointed out that the maximum distance of induced earthquakes for fluid injection is 20\u00a0km, according to the empirical evidence from plotting epicenters and injection wells. Larger distances could not be related to the stress\/strain regime within the reservoir, except for the case of large geological structures affected by static stress changes (folds, master faults, etc.).\nThe presence of master faults (triggering earthquakes of magnitude \u22656) inside the 20\u00a0km radius circle implicates that the regional tectonic stress field determines the strain accumulation into the reservoir. Additionally, the presence of master faults could increase the occurrence of micro-earthquakes, due to the presence of secondary faults prone to trigger earthquakes by their normal seismic cycle (Scholz, 2018).\nTo compare the kinematics results from the analysis of micro fault-slip data with the macro analysis, we have studied the regional earthquake focal mechanism solutions (Giner-Robles et al., 2012). Hence, the fault plane reactivation have been studied by using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion (Pan et al., 2016), from the focal mechanism solutions of regional earthquakes (50\u00a0km around the gas energy storage facilities, www.ign.es, last access June 2021).\nWe have obtained the strain field (ey main direction and K\u2019), from the Right-Dihedral and Slip Model applying fault-slip data (kinematics) and focal mechanism solutions for regional earthquakes. We have used the Win-tensor software (Delvaux and Sperner, 2003) to obtain the stress tensor from the focal mechanism solutions to be compared with the strain results of earthquakes and faults, and the slip-tendency analysis from the Mohr circle.\nIn this work, we assumed that the orientation of the stress axis 2D horizontal projection, SHmax is parallel to the orientation of the strain axes 2D horizontal projection, and for instantaneous strain cases. Hence, ey, the minimum horizontal stress axis, Shmin, is parallel to the minimum horizontal strain axis, ex. This assumption allows us to estimate the plane projection of the stress trajectories (SHmax and Shmin) from the ey SM results.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nA total of 375 kinematic fault-slip data in 24 outcrops were collected within the 20\u00a0km radius circle (results in Fig. 2\n, geographical location in Fig. 3\n.), mainly slickenside lineaments with sense of the movement developed on calcite\/dolomite fault microplanes (cm-sized). Data are summarized in the supplementary material (excel file). The magnetic declination was lesser than 1\u00b0, and we assumed a compass error by field measuring of \u00b15\u00b0. Outcrops with a number of data lesser than 5 measurements have been removed from the analysis since the RD and SD methods are not able to estimate the slip solutions with 4 or less number of data. Stratigraphic ages comprise from Cretaceous, early Miocene, middle Miocene, late Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary.\n\n4.1\nStrain Slip Model and right-dihedral\nMost of the outcrops are located on Miocene deposits, mainly limestone, dolomite and marls (Fig. 3a). Two strain fields have been interpreted (Fig. 2, see supplementary material for results: Right Dihedral, Slip Method and K\u2032-diagram). A first strain field is defined by ey with NW-SE trend and two components (Fig. 2): 1a) extensional component defined by normal faults with NW-SE trend, and 1b) compressional component activating strike-slip faults with reverse component, oriented NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE. The second strain field is defined by ey with NE-SW trend and exhibits two components: 2a) extensional component defined by normal faults with NE-SW trend, and 2b) compressional component is only defined by a few ENE-WSW strike-slip faults (n\u00a0=\u00a011, Fig. 2) with reverse component, and N\u2013S faults with reverse component (n\u00a0=\u00a07, Fig. 2).\nA total of 8 outcrops were removed due to the low quality of the data (Fig. 3a, grey names). 6 outcrops are located within the circle of 10\u00a0km of radius, showing the ey with NE-SW trend recorded by late Miocene rocks. (Fig. 3a). 9 outcrops are located within the 20\u00a0km radius circle, ey with NE-SW trend under an extensional strain field with strike-slip component. 114 fault-slip data showed results mechanically compatible with a strain tensor oriented NW-SE (strain field 1a), under an extensional regime and with strike-slip component. 162 fault-slip data are congruent with a strain tensor oriented NE-SW under an extensional regime. 32 fault-slip data have shown a strain tensor with ey with E-W trend under an extensional regime with strike-slip component. 28 fault-slip data defined a strain tensor with ey showing N\u2013S trend.\nThe horizontal strain trajectories (Fig. 3c and d) were plotted by using the software Lissage (Lee and Angelier, 1994). Strain trajectories for field 1 are slightly curved from a N\u2013S to NW-SE trend. These trajectories are perpendicular to the NE-SW thrust (Fig. 3c) bounding the reservoir to the SE. (Fig. 3c), accommodating strain in the structural trap. Secondary horizontal strain trajectories are parallel to the structural trap (Fig. 3d).\n\n\n4.2\nInduced seismicity\nA set of 141 earthquakes were recorded within the 20\u00a0km radius circle around the Yela facilities, since the starting date of Yela operations in 2012 up to 2021 (www.ign.es, last access February 2022, Fig. 3. See supplementary information). Instrumental data recorded before 2012 show four earthquakes (two in 1982 of magnitude M\u00a0=\u00a04.1 and M\u00a0=\u00a02.9, one in 1996 of M\u00a0=\u00a02.8, and other in 2001 with magnitude\u00a0=\u00a02.5). No micro earthquakes (M\u00a0<\u00a02) have been recorded in the zone before the geologic gas storage was operational.\nThe geological natural gas storage facility at Yela is commonly defined in the term of energy storage, using the physical units kWh (to check monthly gas energy storage, see the official web browser at https:\/\/www.enagas.es\/enagas\/es\/Transporte_de_gas\/Almacenamientos_Subterraneos, last access February 2022). Data of gas operations used in this work were obtained from this official web site. To represent volume gas data, we have changed from energy units (kWh) to volume units (m3) applying the following equation:\n\nequation [1]\nEnergy (kWh)\u00a0=\u00a0[vol (m3) * calorific value (MJ\/m3) * 1.02264] \/ 3.6\n\n\n\nThe calorific value of natural gas, the amount of heat produced on combusting a unit volume of gas, usually rages between 37.5 and 43\u00a0MJ\/m3, and depending on the quality of natural gas, it can deviate \u00b15%. 1.02264 is a constant correction factor, and 3.6 is the conversion factor for kWh. However, without more than a 5% loss in accuracy, we assume that 1\u00a0m3 of natural gas corresponds to 10.55\u00a0kWh.\nPlotting the monthly seismic energy (J) released with the injection\/withdrawal gas volume (m3) into the reservoir (Fig. 4\na and b), the injection maximum volume is shown in the summer season, while the gas maximum withdrawal volume in autumn-winter seasons. The gas operations (Fig. 4c) shows a starting point in 2012, related with a cluster of 21 earthquakes with a maximum magnitude of M\u00a0=\u00a02 (see left circle in Fig. 4c). The maximum cluster comprises 43 earthquakes of maximum magnitude of M\u00a0=\u00a02.3, which occurred in October 2017 (Fig. 4). The gas storage worked at his maximum capacity from May 2019 to present day, showing a typical seasonal saw-curve of injection\/withdrawal (Fig. 4c, right grey shadow zone).\nThe gas injection\/withdrawal operation has been increasing from 2012 to July 2021, according to the maximum stored gas into the reservoir (Fig. 4a). We have classified the seismic peaks between the years 2012 and 2021 (Fig. 4c). The first peak (P12a) is related with the starting operations in Yela, in March of 2012, with an earthquake of M\u00a0=\u00a02.3\u00a0at 11\u00a0km depth, although no data about injection\/withdrawal volume are available. The second injection peak of 2012 (P12b, November, Fig. 4b) triggered 13 earthquakes with Mmax\u00a0=\u00a02.1, between November and early December 2012. Most of the earthquake peaks are related to the injection stages, either displaced with a time lag from the annual maximum injection date (see arrows in Fig. 4a), or in coincidence with the month of the maximum injection volume. No relationship between gas withdrawal and earthquake has been established (Fig. 4b).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nStrain\/stress field\n10 focal mechanism solutions were used (Fig. 5\n, Herraiz et al., 2000; Giner-Robles et al., 2012, supplementary material, excel file earthquakes). Most of them are located south of the Yela site related to the basement flexural structure (Giner-Robles et al., 2012) and are in agreement with the regional strain field defined by Herraiz et al. (2000). Reverse earthquakes focal mechanisms reveal a compressive stage in the Madrid Basin.\nThe strain field defined by the ey orientation and obtained from the slip-method and the right-dihedral are in agreement in comparison with the seismic regional strain field obtained from the analysis of the focal mechanism solutions (Fig. 5, ey with NW-SW trend and reverse component). The strain field 1, featured by ey oriented NW-SE, shows an unambiguously similarity to the ey orientation obtained from the focal mechanisms, i.e. N141\u00b0 versus N139\u00b0 respectively. 25 fault-slip data agree with the focal mechanism solutions for a regional compressive strain field. Conversely, the K\u2032-diagram shows that the strain field 1 consists of an extensional tectonic strain field (supplementary material, results-stations.pdf). The strain field 2 is defined by ey N51\u00b0, versus ey N43\u00b0 obtained from earthquake focal mechanisms (Fig. 5). This strain field is also compatible with the regional strain field defined by Herraiz et al. (2000), but with extensional component. In both cases, the kinematics comparison between strain fault-slip data and earthquake focal mechanisms are in agreement from the horizontal axes comparison and tectonic regime. Nevertheless, the fault-slip kinematics suggests a local strain field with similar ey orientation (strain field 1, NW-SE, Fig. 5), but characterized by extension. Moreover, the secondary strain field (2) shows a switch of the strain axes, with ey oriented NE-SW, perpendicular to strain field 1, and with an extensional component. This interchange of axes could be interpreted as the 3D strain field distribution according to the structure folding. Once the anticline affecting Cretaceous carbonates is formed, the fold core experiences compression, while the upper part undergoes extension (see Fig. 21.18 in Ramsay and Huber, 1987). Therefore, we interpret that the local strain field featured by extension is a shallow strain field (probably less than 5\u00a0km deep), where NE-SW and NW-SE faults are reactivated as normal faults. Both fault sets configure a 3D arrangement of extensional structures prone to leak fluid by lateral migration due to overpressure..\nThe stress field obtained from the Delvaux analysis (Fig. 6\n) is defined as a reverse stress field featured by \u03c31 with N136\u00b0 (NW-SE) trend, \u03c33 vertical, and \u03c32 with N41\u00b0 (NE-SW) trend. This result is in agreement with the results obtained from the fault-slip data and the orientation of ey (ranging between N 119\u00b0\u2013141\u00b0, Fig. 2). The result of the dilatation tendency indicates that faults oriented NNE-SSW and NE-SW could be reactivated as reverse faults (Fig. 6). Therefore, there is a coincidence between the ey orientation (strain field), and the \u03c31 orientation (stress field) defined by the focal mechanism solutions from regional earthquakes and the fault-slip data measured in the nearby outcrops. This trend is NW-SE, in agreement with the regional active stress field defined by Herraiz et al. (2000).\n\n\n5.2\nInduced seismicity\nThe first injection gas operation triggered induced seismicity in November 2012 (Fig. 4b, P12a and P12b), probably related to the increasing of the pore pressure. However, the next injection stages in November 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 triggered a few earthquakes not larger than M\u00a0=\u00a02 (occurred in July 2015, event P15, in coincidence with summer injection operation). The accumulated gas in this period was about 4.7 * 106\u00a0m3. During November 2017, the induced seismicity notably increased (Fig. 4b, P17b) with 47 earthquakes and a maximum magnitude of Mmax\u00a0=\u00a02.3. This cluster shows up when the total stored gas volume reaches approximately 7.6 * 108\u00a0m3 (Fig. 4b). From 2017 to June 2021, two decreasing seismic peaks (magnitude and energy, P19, P20) were detected in November 2019 and 2020. Both peaks coincide with the accumulated underground energy (Fig. 4b), related with the injection\/withdrawal balance (remaining stored gas, injected gas minus withdrawn gas). Our results suggest that small induced seismic peaks appear (P12, P14, P17b, P19, P20, Fig. 4) due to winter operations (between November and February). To reinforce this, we have applied a cross correlation analysis between the injection data and earthquake occurrence (see supplementary material, correlation.pdf). Both time series reveal stationarity and the correlation shows a lag of 3 months between the injection and the earthquake occurrence, which takes place at the end of the injection operations. Therefore, we interpret that micro-earthquakes are triggered when the maximum reservoir pore pressure is reached at the end of the injection operations. Delayed triggering of induced earthquake is nowadays a matter of discussion (e.g. Pe\u00f1a-Castro et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2022; Lasocki et al., 2022). The study of this delay time is far beyond the objective of this work.\nOn the other hand, the depth distribution of the induced earthquake hypocentres (20\u00a0km away from Yela) shows a maximum between 3 and 6\u00a0km (Fig. 7\n). Three of the regional earthquakes (50\u00a0km away of Yela) are located at 2\u00a0km depth (plus error bar, see the vertical red line in Fig. 7), which are defined as reverse earthquakes with strike-slip component (Giner-Robles et al., 2012). This suggests that the Yela reservoir (2,300\u00a0m depth) is affected by the regional reverse strain field. Therefore, reverse earthquakes could be affecting the reservoir, along with normal earthquakes related to the local extensional strain field. The sense of relaxation during the local seismic event is a function of the orientation and the resolved stress along such failure planes.\nRegarding the potential induced maximum earthquake magnitude, we have applied the McGarr empirical equation (McGarr, 2014, equation 13):\n\nEquation [2]\nM0max\u00a0=\u00a0G*\u0394V\n\nWhere M0max is the maximum seismic moment, \u0394V is the injected gas, and G is the modulus of rigidity and normally used\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0GPa. In Yela, the maximum volume of stored gas was estimated around 1.14 * 109\u00a0m3 of gas volume (see https:\/\/www.enagas.es\/stfls\/EnagasImport\/Ficheros\/513\/97\/Folleto%20Yela%20-%20Ingl%C3%A9s.pdf last access August 2021), corresponding to 1.2 * 1010\u00a0kWh of energy storage. Besides, future induced seismicity clusters could be related with a rapid daily flow injection, instead of the total stored volume. According to the technical disposals of the Yela, the maximum gas flow per day is 15 * 106\u00a0m3\/day (1.75 * 108\u00a0kWh of officially energy storage).\nApplying the McGarr's equation (cushion gas not included), the result is a seismic energy (E) of 1.71 *1015\u00a0J, which is as minimum magnitude as of M 6.5 (log E\u00a0=\u00a05.24\u00a0+\u00a01.44 * M). However, the magnitude obtained from the application of the McGarr's equation is based on the assumption that all of the strain induced by injecting a fluid is released as a seismic-sourced. However, the reservoir permeability allows accommodating the fluid injection with a small variation of the pore pressure, showing creep deformation and heat conductivity. Accordingly, induced earthquakes magnitudes use to be lower than the maximum magnitude obtained from McGarr's equation, which has to be considered as an extreme theoretical approach, rather than the expected earthquake magnitude.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe regional strain field in the Yela geologic gas storage (central Spain) is defined by a compressive regime with ey horizontal shortening trending NW-SE. The regional stress field obtained from the Delvaux fault-slip analysis is reverse and defined by \u03c31 with NW-SE trend. According to the Slip-Tendency analysis, NE-SW and NNE-SSW oriented fault planes can be reactivated as reverse faults with a strike-slip component. Shallow reverse earthquakes (2\u00a0km depth) could occur into the reservoir, as suggested by the regional and local strain and stress fields.\nThe local strain field shows two extensional solutions defined by ey NW-SE (strain field 1) and ey NE-SW trend (strain field 2). These local strain induced the reactivation of faults oriented NW-SE as normal faults and N\u2013S faults as strike-slip faults. Lateral underground gas leakage would be determined by normal NW-SE faults, and N\u2013S\/E-W strike-slip faults with an extensional component.\nInduced seismicity related to Yela operations was recorded in the time period comprised between 2012 and 2021. Initially, a seismic cluster was related to the starting injection operations. Then, different seasonally seismic peaks were identified in summer operations, during the injection phase, but it decreases in frequency and earthquake magnitude year by year. A time lag of 3 months has been determined from cross correlation analysis. A seismic cluster with 47 earthquakes and with a Mmax\u00a0=\u00a02.3 took place during the summer-autumn operations of 2017. Ongoing summer operations of injection triggered small clusters of induced seismicity in autumn\/winter, although the recorded induced earthquake activities have decreased in frequency and magnitude over the last period from 2017 to 2021. However, there is no model to explain this fact despite the relationship between injection gas and earthquake occurrence is positive. Since Yela is working at the maximum stored gas volume (1.1 * 109\u00a0m3) at present day, future relevant and potentially felt earthquake clusters of induced seismicity could be related to the rapid daily injection gas of the reservoir instead of the maximum volume storage.\n\n","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe vortical flow associated with progressive deformation within shear zones and between shear zone pairs can significantly affect the geometries of pre-existing and contemporaneous fabrics and structures (e.g., veins, faults, and dykes; Beach, 1975; Platt, 1983; Ramsay et al., 1983a; Lister and Snoke, 1984; Passchier, 1986; Olson and Pollard, 1991; Alsop et al., 2021). This occurs at a variety of scales, and correctly interpreting these geometries with an appreciation for rotational dynamics can greatly enhance both local and regional structural and tectonic models (e.g., Fossen et al., 2019). These interpretations not only have fundamental scientific implications, but can also have key practical applications where ore bodies in the form of e.g., vein systems, intrusions, and stratiform layers are progressively deformed (Hodgson, 1989; Windh, 1995; Laing, 2004; Perret et al., 2020). Despite the concept of vorticity being widely recognised in structural geology (e.g., Xypolias, 2010), its application including an appreciation of the implications for ore deposit evolution has been much more uncommon (e.g., Blenkinsop et al., 2020). Instead, ore deposit models typically treat metalliferous vein systems as planar fractures that propagate with predictable opening modes and orientations relative to an overarching stress field, without considering contemporaneous and progressive rotation or folding (e.g., Sibson, 1996; Robert and Poulsen, 2001). In such models, discrepancies in vein geometry and evidence of successive deformation is typically assigned to separate and polyphase deformation events. In those ore deposit vein models which do document progressive deformation, the vein systems are typically treated as en-echelon tension vein arrays with a principal focus on how the geometry of the forming ore body evolves with increasing strain (Fig. 1\nA) (e.g., Laing, 2004). However, the next step into an understanding of more complex vein geometries should involve an appreciation of the complexity of shear zones and how geometric and kinematic reversals can occur along veins during rotation within evolving shear zones and between shear zone pairs (e.g., Fig. 1B and 1C) (Ghosh, 1966; Ramsay et al., 1983b; Hudleston, 1989; Harris, 2003). Lack of this appreciation could lead to metalliferous vein deposits being misinterpreted to have polyphase deformation histories to account for opposing geometric and kinematic indicators that can instead be explained by a single and coherent progressive model (e.g., Fig. 1B and 1C) (after Fossen et al., 2019). A consequence of such misinterpretations might be how metallogenic events relate to the regional structural and tectonic evolution of a province which can subsequently impair exploration models and strategies.\nIn this contribution, we investigate whether the formation of an economic vein deposit that has previously been interpreted to have formed during successive phases of polyphase deformation can instead be better explained by a progressive formation model. We do this by examining the Cavanacaw (formerly known as the Omagh or Lack) vein-hosted Au\u2013Ag\u2013Pb deposit (>0.5 Moz Au) in Northern Ireland (Fig. 2\n) (Galantas Gold Corporation, 2014). The hosting Dalradian Supergroup rocks of the Grampian Terrane are part of the Irish-Scottish sector of the Laurentian Caledonian belt which formed during the prolonged Caledonian Orogeny (Ordovician\u2013Devonian), but was locally affected by the later Variscan Orogeny (Carboniferous). The Laurentian Caledonides hosts several auriferous and polymetallic vein deposits and non-economic occurrences that are interpreted to relate to either or both orogenic cycles (Fig. 2) (Pattrick, 1985; Pattrick et al., 1988; Samson and Banks, 1988; Pattrick and Russell, 1989; Earls et al., 1992; Cliff and Wolfenden et al., 1992; Curtis et al., 1993; Earls et al., 1996; Ixer et al., 1997; Wilkinson et al., 1999; Treagus et al., 1999; Parnell et al., 2000; Lusty et al., 2011; Mark et al., 2013; Rice et al., 2016; Tanner, 2014; Rice et al., 2018). For Cavanacaw, previous studies used cathodoluminescence, fluid inclusion, and stable isotope analyses to interpret the deposit to have had a long-lived and polyphase deformation history that was directly associated with the economic mineralisation: the broadly N\u2013S-striking, complexly deformed vein system is inferred to have been initiated during the Ordovician Grampian event of the Caledonian orogeny (c. 470 Ma) and to have been mineralised through the reactivation and injection of two distinct regional fluid flow pulses during the Caledonian (470\u2013400\u00a0Ma) and Variscan (c. 327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma) orogenies (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Earlier studies have further documented broad similarities in ore mineral assemblages, associated gangue phases, and fluid chemistry to interpret the world-class Curraghinalt orogenic gold deposit (>6 Moz Au), located c. 27\u00a0km to the northeast of Cavanacaw, to be genetically related (Fig. 3\n) (Earls et al., 1996; Wilkinson et al., 1999; Parnell et al., 2000; Dalradian Resources Inc, 2018). These interpretations above are problematic, however, as: (1) the vein systems at both localities have significantly different strike orientations and kinematics that are not easily reconciled by a common and contemporaneous event; (2) the ore mineralogy and paragenesis between the two deposits actually differs significantly, with arsenopyrite abundant in the primary stage and galena dominating in the secondary stage following intense brecciation at Cavanacaw, whereas these phases are largely absent at Curraghinalt (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000); and (3) gold in the form of electrum differs in alloy composition and is most abundant in the primary sulphide stage at Curraghinalt but is associated with the secondary stage at Cavanacaw (Earls et al., 1996; Chapman et al., 2000; Parnell et al., 2000). The Curraghinalt deposit has recently been dated through 40Ar\/39Ar (sericite) and Re\u2013Os (molybdenite) to have formed during a c. 10 Ma window in the Late Ordovician (462.7\u2013452.8\u00a0Ma), i.e., during the late\/post-Grampian, post-orogenic \u2018collapse\u2019 event (Rice et al., 2016). Few age data from the other known polymetallic systems in the UK and Irish Caledonides exist but the available data from Cononish and Rhynie in Scotland show considerably younger Early Devonian U\u2013Pb (zircon) and 40Ar\/39Ar (K-feldspar) ages between 412\u2013407\u00a0Ma (Fig. 2; Treagus et al., 1999; Mark et al., 2011; Parry et al., 2011; Rice et al., 2012). The implications of the geochronological data in respect to Cavanacaw and other vein occurrences in the Caledonides is yet to be considered despite Curraghinalt being the largest known gold deposit in the UK and Ireland by a considerable margin (>5 Moz Au).\nIn this study, we demonstrate through the examination and interpretation of largely unpublished archival historic trench and underground maps, as well as through our own structural measurements and observations, that although the wider Cavanacaw area records a polyphase deformation history, the formation of the economic, metalliferous vein system can be explained by a single progressive deformational model. The progressive deformation model accounts for the varying vein orientations and textures, swings in host rock foliation orientations from the regional trend, and opposing vein geometries\/kinematics in respect to the overall shear direction. The model produced has significant implications for interpretations regarding the timing and geodynamic setting in which the vein system formed (e.g., Cliff and Wolfenden et al., 1992; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). We also present analysis from other nearby gold vein occurrences in the western Sperrin Mountains to assess how these may link to Cavanacaw and, in turn, develop a regional structural and tectonic model to account for the large-scale structures that appear to be significant for the economic mineralisation. Finally, we use our analysis to assess how Cavanacaw may relate to both the nearby, and better understood, Late Ordovician and Grampian event related Curraghinalt deposit and to the broader gold and polymetallic vein metallogeny hosted by the Laurentian Caledonian belt of Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and context of metallic mineralisation in the Laurentian Caledonides\nThe Dalradian Supergroup rocks of the Grampian Terrane that host the Cavanacaw deposit represent a succession of late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks (Figs. 2 and 3). These were deposited onto the southeastern passive margin of the Laurentian continent during the opening of the Iapetus Ocean (c. 800\u2013510\u00a0Ma) (Cooper and Johnston, 2004). The subsequent convergence of Laurentia with Baltica and Avalonia lead to the closure of Iapetus during the prolonged Caledonian-Appalachian Orogeny, which in the UK and Ireland is subdivided into the Grampian event (Early\u2013Middle Ordovician) and the Scandian event (Silurian\u2013Early Devonian) (McKerrow et al., 2000; Leslie et al., 2008; Stephenson et al., 2013; Chew and Strachan, 2014).\nThe Grampian event in Northern Ireland initiated with an island arc-ophiolite complex from the Midland Valley Terrane (the Tyrone Igneous Complex) accreting onto an outboard microcontinent block of Laurentia (the Tyrone Central Inlier) (c. 475 Ma) (Figs. 2 and 3) (Chew et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2011; Hollis et al., 2012, 2013). The continuing NW\u2013SE convergence and the closure of the palaeo-ocean between the composite Tyrone Igneous Complex and Laurentia subsequently folded the Dalradian Supergroup rocks into recumbent SE-to SSE-verging isoclinal nappes to produce regional stratigraphic repetitions; this closure culminated in ESE-directed oblique-dextral thrusting of the Dalradian nappes over the Tyrone Igneous Complex and Central Inlier along the Omagh Thrust (c. 475\u2013465\u00a0Ma) (Figs. 3 and 4\n) (Alsop and Hutton, 1993a). Cavanacaw, as well as the Curraghinalt deposit, are hosted on one of the SSE-verging, overturned limbs of these major isoclinal nappes; the Sperrin Nappe (Fig. 3). At the current exposure level, upper greenschist to lower amphibolite grade metamorphic conditions were reached during nappe formation (Alsop and Hutton, 1993a). The ESE-directed motion of the nappe was principally accommodated by the regional Omagh Thrust Fault, which broadly dips moderately (40\u00b0) towards the NW to NNW (Figs. 3 and 5\n) (Alsop and Hutton, 1993a). The Omagh Thrust Fault is interpreted to be a footwall splay of the steeper, concealed Fair Head\u2013Clew Bay line which is thought to be the continuation of the Highland Boundary Fault in Scotland (Fig. 2) (Max and Riddihough, 1975; Hutton, 1987). The recent geochronological data from the Curraghinalt deposit (c. 463\u2013453\u00a0Ma) suggests that the vein propagation and mineralisation occurred immediately after the main thrusting and crustal thickening of the Grampian event (Rice et al., 2016). The exact structural setting of the Curraghinalt deposit and its relationship to the overall Grampian orogenic evolution is still unclear as no detailed, deposit-specific structural data and model have yet been published; however, the WNW\u2013ESE-striking vein array appears to be spatially associated with E\u2013W-striking shear zones (Fig. 3). The Curraghinalt mineralisation age is only slightly younger than a suite of c. 470\u2013464 Ma calc-alkaline 'stitching' intrusions in the Tyrone Igneous Complex that were interpreted to be associated with subduction polarity reversal (Fig. 3) (Cooper et al., 2011).\nThe subsequent Scandian event involved a sinistrally transpressive closure of the Iapetus Ocean as Laurentia and its accreted island arc and ophiolite complexes collided with Baltica and Avalonia (Soper et al., 1992). In the UK and Ireland, the regional crustal thickening and metamorphism associated with the \u2018head-on\u2019 Laurentia and Baltica collision (c. 440\u2013429\u00a0Ma) appears to be largely restricted to the Northern Highland Terrane of Scotland (resulting in the deformation within the Moine Supergroup; Fig. 2), while the Grampian Terrane was either: (1) located several hundred kilometres south of the collision zone (Dewey and Strachan, 2003); or (2) a rigid block within the contractional deformation zone at the leading edges of the colliding plates (Leslie et al., 2008). However, the Grampian Terrane was not totally unaffected by the Scandian event. The \u2018head on\u2019 collision may be dated at c. 437 Ma (U\u2013Pb zircon age) in the Dalradian Supergroup of Donegal through xenoliths found within a lamprophyre containing a magmatic foliation parallel to that in the host rock (Kirkland et al., 2013). These late-stage regional fabrics are indicative of syn-kinematic emplacement during regional NW\u2013SE compression (Kirkland et al., 2013; Alsop, 1996). The N to NNE-directed Laurentia and Avalonia collision that followed in the mid-Silurian (c. 430\u2013425\u00a0Ma) emplaced an Ordovician\u2013Silurian fore-arc accretionary complex onto the Laurentian margin (the Down\u2013Longford Terrane in central Ireland and Southern Uplands Terrane in Scotland) (Fig. 2) (Chew and Strachan, 2014; Stone, 2014). This collision was highly oblique, and crustal-scale sinistral strike-slip movement ensued along orogen-parallel NE- to ENE-striking faults and shear zones both within the Grampian Terrane and the accretionary complex to the SE (e.g., Hutton, 1982; Soper et al., 1992; Dewey and Strachan 2003). This event was contemporaneous with the emplacement of voluminous felsic magmatism, possibly during either local or regional transtension interpreted to relate to a slab \u2018break-off\u2019 or delamination (Fig. 2) (Atherton and Ghani, 2002; Cooper et al., 2016; Miles et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2018). Overall, the regional Scandian, sinistral transpression had been replaced by regional sinistral transtension by the Early Devonian which led to the formation of depositional basins (c. 410\u2013395\u00a0Ma; Dewey and Strachan, 2003). Deposition was interrupted by the short-lived and northward-directed Acadian (Proto-Variscan) event between c. 400\u2013390\u00a0Ma where major pre-existing faults and shear zones accommodated sinistral transpression in Scotland (Mendum, 2012).\nApart from Curraghinalt, the only two gold occurrences within the Grampian Terrane that have been dated (Cononish and Rhynie in Scotland) formed during the Scandian event (Fig. 2) (412\u2013407\u00a0Ma; Treagus et al., 1999; Mark et al., 2011; Parry et al., 2011; Rice et al., 2012). Cononish, as well as many other metalliferous vein systems such as those at Croagh Patrick and Clontibret \u2013 Clay Lake in Ireland, have been interpreted to be hosted by NNE- to NNW-striking Riedel, antithetic Riedel, and tension fractures related to NE to ENE-striking sinistral strike-slip faults and a broadly horizontal, approximately N to NNE-orientated maximum principal stress (see Figs. 2 and 4) (Tanner, 2014; Rice et al., 2018). Most of the known metalliferous vein systems have not yet been studied in detail, but many are spatially related to the post-Grampian to Scandian calc-alkaline granitoids and, at least at Cononish where most data are available, are enriched in metals indicative of a magmatic affinity (e.g., Te, Bi, Mo, Cu, Pb, and Zn) (Curtis et al., 1993; Rice et al., 2018; Spence-Jones et al., 2018).\nAt least some of the major NE to ENE-striking transcurrent faults were reactivated during the Carboniferous Variscan (Hercynian) Orogeny in response to a broadly WNW\u2013ESE compression (Fig. 4). During the early to mid-Carboniferous, it is interpreted that WNW\u2013ESE-directed compression in Northern Ireland induced a zone of dextral transpression between the Omagh Thrust\u2013Castle Archdale and reactivated Caledonian faults to the southeast, uplifting the Lack and Lisbellaw Inlier basement blocks as a positive flower structure (Mitchell, 2004). The timing of this correlates with the K\u2013Ar model ages (327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma) presented by Earls et al. (1996) and Parnell et al. (2000) on clay-rich fault-gouge samples collected from across the Sperrin Mountains. The transpression was followed by a switch to extension and the formation of depositional basins (e.g., the Newtownstewart Basin) (Fig. 3; Mitchell, 2004). The end of the Variscan was characterised by a return to oblique-dextral overthrusting along the regional Omagh Thrust Fault (Mitchell, 2004). There seems to have been brittle reactivation of at least some of the metalliferous vein systems during the Carboniferous, responsible for paragenetically late base metal-only mineralisation, particularly at Cononish (Samson and Banks, 1988; Earls et al., 1996; Treagus et al., 1999; Parnell et al., 2000; Lusty et al., 2011). It is notable, however, that the recent geochronology data presented by Rice et al. (2016) suggests that brines of Carboniferous age and origin were not involved in the paragenetically late base metal mineralisation at Curraghinalt as initially proposed by Wilkinson et al. (1999).\n\n\n3\nDetailed description of study area\n\n3.1\nThe Lack Inlier\nThe study area and the Cavanacaw deposit are located within the so-called Lack Inlier, 5\u00a0km west southwest of the town of Omagh (Fig. 3). The Lack Inlier is an uplifted and fault-bounded package of Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks that belong to the Dalradian Supergroup (GSNI, 1995a; Cooper and Johnston, 2004). The foliation within the inlier is parallel to subparallel to bedding and generally strikes ENE\u2013WSW and dips moderately towards to the NNW (Fig. 5) (GSNI, 1995a; Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). The Lack Inlier consists primarily of schistose psammites, semipelites, and pelites of the Mullaghcarn Formation that are interbedded with basic volcaniclastic rocks of the Largy Volcanic Member (Fig. 5) (GSNI, 1995a; McFarlane et al., 2009). The northern and southeastern margins of the inlier are bounded by the Cool Fault and the Omagh Thrust\u2013Castle Archdale Fault complex respectively, both of which are hosted in the strongly deformed graphitic semipelites of the Glengawna Formation (Fig. 5) (GSNI, 1995a; McFarlane et al., 2009). These ENE\u2013WSW-striking long-lived faults juxtapose the Dalradian Supergroup metamorphic rocks against the younger Upper Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks that surround the Lack Inlier (GSNI, 1995a). A series of other steep ENE\u2013WSW-striking transcurrent faults, such as the Sperrin Fault, are also mapped as internally dissecting the inlier (Fig. 5). Northeast of Omagh, Tyrone Igneous Complex rocks are present in the footwall of the Omagh Thrust Fault (Fig. 3; GSNI, 1995b). The extent of the Tyrone Igneous Complex underneath the Lack Inlier in this area is unknown but a prominent bouguer anomaly (Dromore High; Fig. 3) may indicate its presence at depth (Reay, 2004). A swarm of Palaeogene dykes striking NW to WNW represent the youngest geological feature in the region (Fig. 5) (GSNI, 1995a; Cooper et al., 2012).\n\n\n3.2\nThe \u2018Omagh Lineament\u2019\nA deep-seated, NNE\u2013SSW-trending crustal lineament has been interpreted to run through the eastern part of Lack Inlier and the Cavanacaw deposit (Fig. 3) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000; Cooper et al., 2013). This \u2018Omagh Lineament\u2019 is inferred to extend along strike for an overall length of 70\u00a0km from Drumahoe in County Londonderry (NNE) to Tempo in County Fermanagh (SSW). The Omagh Lineament is one of many N to NNE-striking deep-seated crustal lineaments that are inferred to exist across Scotland and Ireland that may be as old as 1800\u00a0Ma (Russel and Hazeldine, 1992; Hutton and Alsop, 1996; Earls et al., 2000; Cooper et al., 2013). The Omagh Lineament is a rather weak feature on geophysical surveys (e.g., Tellus surveys; GSNI, 2007a) and its existence is largely inferred based on the presence of the N\u2013S-striking Cavanacaw vein system; a significant swing in the strike of the Dalradian metamorphic rocks from ENE\u2013WSW (075\u00b0\u2013255\u00b0) strikes to NNE\u2013SSW (030\u00b0\u2013210\u00b0) strikes; the rare occurrence of a basic Palaeogene dyke (Cooper et al., 2012) and the eastern extent of the quartz porphyry \u2018Sperrin Mountains Suite\u2019 of minor intrusions (Cooper et al., 2013); N\u2013S-striking minor faults; and by the approximate location of the eastern margin of the Dromore High bouguer anomaly (Fig. 3) (GSNI, 1997; Reay, 2004; Cooper et al., 2013). The most prominent feature of these is the significant swing in strike of the Dalradian metamorphic rocks across the Newtownstewart region, just north of the Lack Inlier; we call this feature the \u2018West Sperrin Knee Bend\u2019 (Fig. 3). According to our interpretations in this paper, the West Sperrin Knee Bend plays an important role in the development of the mineralisation and regional deformation.\n\n\n3.3\nThe Cavanacaw resource, ore mineralogy, and paragenesis\nThe Cavanacaw deposit has a measured resource of 32,202 oz at 7.24\u00a0g\/t Au, an indicated resource of 147,784 oz at 6.78\u00a0g\/t Au, and an inferred resource of 341,123 oz at 7.71\u00a0g\/t Au according to most recent estimates (Galantas Gold Corporation, 2014). Ag is alloyed with the Au, with average assay results ranging between 1 and 2.5 parts of Ag to 1 part of Au (Galantas Gold Corporation, 2014). Assay results further report up to several percent Pb in the veins (Galantas Gold Corporation, 2014). The Au\u2013Ag\u2013Pb resource is structurally hosted by steep 1\u20133\u00a0m wide zones of quartz-sulphide veining, shearing, and sericite alteration that cross-cut the host rock and foliation fabrics (Fig. 6\nA) (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). Most of the resource is hosted by the Kearney vein structure which was historically exploited in an open excavation pit (now mostly infilled) and is currently being mined in a series of underground tunnels (Fig. 6A). The discovery and exploration history of the deposit is detailed extensively in Cliff and Wolfenden (1992) and Galantas Gold Corporation (2014, 2020).\nSeveral sulphide phases are present in the veins but the most common are aggregates of pyrite (Py) and arsenopyrite (AsPy) which are typically intensely brecciated and cemented\/replaced by undeformed galena and chalcopyrite (Fig. 6B) (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). Minor carbonate can also be found in the quartz veins (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). The primary, pre-breccia Py\u2013AsPy dominated stage is suggested to be related to broadly Caledonian (470\u2013400\u00a0Ma) fluids with a significant magmatic component by Earls et al. (1996) and Parnell et al. (2000), based mostly on extrapolation of analysis undertaken at Curraghinalt. The secondary sulphide stage is dominated by base metals, particularly galena, followed by a late phase of carbonate-rich mineralisation (Fig. 6B; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Analysis of fluid inclusions in the late quartz phases at Cavanacaw indicate high salinity brines which were interpreted to relate to basinal fluids mobilised during the Variscan orogeny (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Relatively low fluid inclusion trapping pressures have been interpreted to suggest the mineralisation was precipitated at epizonal crustal depths (<5\u00a0km) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). The repeated localisation of deformation and fluids into the Cavanacaw vein system is attributed to the structural reactivation of the Omagh Lineament (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000).\nElectrum (Au, Ag) is typically anhedral, located along narrow 1\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm wide fractures in pyrite and spatially-associated with quartz\/Py boundaries, implying that electrum precipitated during the second, breccia-related deformation stage along with base metal sulphides (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992; Earls et al., 1996; Chapman et al., 2000; Parnell et al., 2000). Au can also be found as trace substitutions within the galena (up to 1.2\u00a0at. % Au) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). It is currently unclear whether the Au was remobilised from the first-stage Py\u2013AsPy phase during this second deformation stage.\nThe alteration halos around the larger veins are typically comprised of sericitised and bleached host rock that can extend outwards for several metres before grading into unaltered wall rock (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). Black sulphidic clay-rich fault-gouge can also form part of the alteration halo (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). These alteration halos are most prolific in quartz-poor metasedimentary host rocks such as graphitic semipelites and are associated with sulphides and veinlets (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). McFarlane et al. (2009) identify laterally persistent (up to 4\u00a0km long) ENE\u2013WSW-striking zones that show relatively low magnetic responses and are in the field thoroughly sericitised and silicified (Fig. 5A).\n\n\n3.4\nThe Cavanacaw deposit structural setting\nA 150\u2013200\u00a0m wide structure that relates to zones of high conductivity identified through an induced polarisation survey, the Lack Shear Zone, crosses the Cavanacaw area, striking ENE\u2013WSW and dipping steeply to the N (Figs. 5 and 6A). The Cavanacaw vein system is dominated by major N\u2013S-striking veins to the north of the Lack Shear Zone (e.g., Kearney and Joshua veins; Fig. 6A). Another important, subsidiary NNW\u2013SSE-striking vein system also exists to the south of the shear zone (e.g., Discovery, Gormley, Sharkey veins; Fig. 6A). These two broad veining zones are hereafter referred to as the \u2018Kearney zone\u2019 and \u2018Creevan zone\u2019, respectively (Fig. 6A).\nThe N\u2013S-striking veins in the Kearney zone are more continuous along strike, with the Kearney vein drill-tested to continue for at least 850\u00a0m and to extend to at least 300\u00a0m depth. In the Creevan zone, the vein system consists of a series of NNW\u2013SSE-striking veins with limited along strike continuity (<200\u00a0m). The Creevan zone veins and the Lack Shear Zone are located near the lithological boundary between the Mullaghcarn Formation and Glengawna Formations along the Creevan Burn stream section (Fig. 5; McFarlane et al., 2009; Galantas Gold Corporation, 2020).\nAll veins are vertical or dip steeply (towards east or west) irrespective of strike orientation. Initial workers interpreted the N\u2013S-striking veins to be antithetic principal (P\u2032) shears and the NNW\u2013SSE-striking veins to be subsidiary antithetic Riedel (R\u2019) shears within an overall reverse-dextral shear zone system of the Omagh Thrust that formed during broadly NW\u2013SE-directed Grampian compression (Fig. 4; c. 475\u2013465\u00a0Ma) (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). The specific localisation of the vein system was later attributed to partitioning of Grampian strain along the Omagh Lineament (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). The N\u2013S-striking Kearney vein was interpreted to be hosted by a co-planar shear zone with sinistral displacement, whilst the subsidiary NNW\u2013SSE-striking veins were interpreted to be later structures that cross-cut and displace the principal structure (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). This kinematic framework is further reported to be replicated in nearby N\u2013S-striking regional veins, such as the Rylagh gold vein locality which also records sinistral kinematics (Fig. 3; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Several regional veins such as Rylagh are hosted on the NNE\u2013SSW-striking limb of the West Sperrin Knee Bend proximal to the Omagh Thrust Fault (<5\u00a0km distance) (Fig. 3).\nThe interpretation of a Variscan phase within the Cavanacaw vein system (by Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000) is based on model ages derived from isotope studies (K\u2013Ar and Rb\u2013Sr) on clay-rich fault-gouge sampled from the Kearney vein and low angle thrusts along the Creevan Burn stream section and regionally across the Sperrin Mountains (mean age of 327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). These ages were used to further support the interpretation that the paragenetically late base metal phase of mineralisation was precipitated during the early Carboniferous (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Variscan reactivation is also used to account for the interpretation that the Lack Shear Zone apparently displaces the Cavanacaw vein system in a dextral sense, and for dextral movements on several small-scale faults along the Creevan stream section (Fig. 6A; Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). In this paper, we present a re-interpretation of the kinematic models and inferred ages outlined above.\n\n\n\n4\nMethodology\n\n4.1\nData collection and sources\nThe structural data presented in this study includes observations and measurements collected directly in the field, as well as that compiled from historic exploration data. At Cavanacaw, the historic data includes a collection of trench, stream section, and underground geological maps produced historically by RioFinex North Limited (once a subsidiary of Rio Tinto) in the 1980s (when the deposit was discovered) and more recently by Galantas Gold Corporation (current operators). The Kearney zone was until recently exposed in an open excavation pit (Fig. 7\nA\u2013F) and historically in a series of major exploration trenches produced by RioFinex and Galantas (e.g., Figs. 9, 10A, and 11B). The pits and trenches are now mostly infilled, and the Kearney zone veins are currently exposed in a series of underground exploration tunnels that exceed 2\u00a0km in length over four levels (Fig. 10B). The Creevan zone is primarily exposed for over 2\u00a0km along the Creevan Burn stream section which exploits and strikes parallel to the Lack Shear Zone (e.g., Fig. 7G, 7H, and 8\n\n\n\n). Creevan zone veins were historically exposed in several exploration trenches produced by RioFinex (now all infilled) (Figs. 11A and 11C\u2013F). The authors of the historic exploration data are highlighted where known, however in many cases the authors of the RioFinex trench maps are unfortunately not recorded and the data was found archived at the Cavanacaw mine site. For the most part the trench maps have not been previously published, though a relatively small portion of the northern Kearney exploration trench (part of Fig. 9D) is presented in Cliff and Wolfenden (1992) and the exploration trench maps of the Kerr vein array (Fig. 10A) are presented in Galantas Gold Corporation (2008). The underground maps of the Kearney vein (see Fig. 10B) have recently been published in Galantas Gold Corporation (2020) to document the occurrence of ore shoots. Additional field data include a geological map of the Creevan Burn stream section (Fig. 8A; Galantas Gold Corporation, 2020).\nMost of our regional vein data was collected in the field along poorly exposed stream sections. For comparison, we also have structural data from a detailed geological map from another vein system, the Rylagh vein c. 5\u00a0km NE from the Cavanacaw mine (Fig. 3 and 12). This vein system was visited in the field to ground check the map. Digital structural data provided by the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI) has also been compiled to analyse regional structures such as the West Sperrin Knee Bend. This digital data originates from the Omagh, Draperstown, and Newtownstewart 1: 50,000 geological mapping sheets (GSNI, 1995a, 1995b, 2008).\nWe combine the existing maps and material with our own field observations to propose a new, more comprehensive, holistic interpretation of the structure of the Cavanacaw system. Regardless of where the data was collected or compiled from, particular attention has been paid to host rock foliation fabrics and their relative orientations, the geometry and cross-cutting relationships of the vein and fault structures, the kinematics of the structures (from e.g., displacements and foliation drag), the textures of veins and whether structures are sulphidic and therefore likely to be associated with the metallic mineralisation. This has enabled a deformation sequence to be established for the host rock foliation fabrics, vein and faults systems, and reveals how the economic mineralisation relates to these.\n\n\n4.2\nData analysis\nThe structural data for the different areas analysed (i.e., the Kearney zone, Creevan zone, and regionally), as well as data for the individual vein and fault populations, were plotted on equal angle stereonets using Rick Allmendinger's stereonet application (Table 1\n, Fig. 13). The diagrams also illustrate textural variability and sulphide content (see key in Fig. 13). Mean vectors of the rose diagrams were calculated as well as the 1% area contouring of the calculated poles (Table 1; Fig. 13). Using the stereonets we analyse how the structure orientations and kinematics compare to a theoretical Riedel fault model for transcurrent simple shear (after Wilcox et al., 1973) (Fig. 14). The kinematic analysis allows us to interpret what the orientation of the principal stresses was when the vein and fault systems formed (Fig. 14). This approach has proven successful for confining and interpreting the palaeostress fields responsible for other steeply dipping to vertical auriferous vein and fault systems hosted by the Laurentian Caledonides of Ireland and Scotland (see Tanner, 2014).\n\n\n\n5\nObservations\n\n5.1\nCavanacaw host rock lithologies and structural fabrics\nThe main host rock lithologies and structures observed at Cavanacaw are consistent with those observed and detailed by Cliff and Wolfenden (1992), McFarlane et al. (2009), and Galantas Gold Corporation (2020). Exposure in the open excavation pit shows heterolithic psammitic and semi-pelitic metasediments dominate in the Kearney zone (Fig. 7B\u2013D). The Creevan Burn stream section transverses through various host rock lithologies (Fig. 8): graphitic pelites, typically interbedded with layers of quartzo-feldspathic semi-pelites, dominate to the east of the Cavanacaw bridge, whilst mixed quartz-muscovite semi-pelites, which can be sericitic and\/or chloritic, dominate to the west (Fig. 8). As observed by McFarlane et al. (2009), intervals and disseminations of fuchsite, pyrite, and metacarbonate pods have been identified in the graphitic pelites, whilst intervals of possible talc-bearing metasediments have been observed across all lithologies. An interval of graphitic pelite (up to 15\u00a0m thick) is also observed upstream of the Discovery vein and is intensely deformed and exploited by a shallowly NW to WNW-dipping reverse shear zone (Fig. 8). The repetition of units across the area may imply that tectonic imbrication exists in the Creevan zone (Fig. 8A). This interpretation is compatible with the broader geological mapping of the Creevan Burn stream section presented in Galantas Gold Corporation (2020).\nThe host rock sequence across the Cavanacaw area is inverted, which is evidenced by graded bedding in massive psammite units downwards into relatively heterolithic psammite\/pelites (i.e., structurally inverted graded bedding), and sharp lithological changes between psammite-dominated layers and structurally overlying semi-pelite-dominated layers. Two pervasive ductile planar fabrics are identifiable in the host rocks (Fig. 7B and 7C). The first, best developed in the psammitic host rocks, is a pervasive grain-shaped fabric defined by the preferential alignment of mica (S1a) and dips more shallowly to the NW than bedding (S0) (Fig. 7B). Elliptical quartz grains in the psammites also defines this fabric. In the semi-pelitic host rocks, a second penetrative, pervasive fabric crenulates the earlier fabric (interpreted as S1b) and is marked by the strong parallel alignment of muscovite and chlorite that dips relatively steeper to the NW than S0 (Fig. 7C). S1b envelopes elongated lenticular ribbons and augen of metamorphic quartz vein, whilst cm-scale dark green to black porphyroblasts of chlorite (retrogressed garnet) are also developed along the schistosity. Both S1a and S1b are consistent with overall overturning and thrusting of the Sperrin Nappe. Locally, an extensional crenulation cleavage (Sext) can be found to deform S1b in the semi-pelites, suggesting a relatively late episode of top-down-to-NW movement (Fig. 7D).\nThe average strike of the composite, sub-parallel bedding-foliation fabric in the host rock differs between the Kearney and Creevan zones; these, in turn, differ from the average strike of the host rock bedding-foliation fabric observed regionally across the Lack Inlier (Fig. 13B, 13E, and 13J). Across the eastern and central portions of the Lack Inlier, the composite host rock fabric strikes ENE\u2013WSW (076\u00b0\u2013256\u00b0) and dips moderately (49\u00b0) towards the NNW (Fig. 13J). In the Kearney zone, the strike of the host rock fabric is orientated anticlockwise of that observed in the Lack Inlier and strikes NE\u2013SW (055\u00b0\u2013235\u00b0) and dips moderately (36\u00b0) towards the NW (Fig. 13B). Finally, the strike of the host rock fabric in the Creevan zone is orientated anticlockwise of those observed in the Lack Inlier and Kearney zone, and strikes NNE\u2013SSW (019\u00b0\u2013199\u00b0) and dips moderately (41\u00b0) towards the WNW (Fig. 13E). In the Creevan zone, this produces a marked, low-amplitude s-shaped swing in the strike of the host rock foliation as the Lack Shear Zone is transected (hereafter, the \u2018Creevan swing\u2019) (see Fig. 8A). There is no significant change in the dip across the zones, however dip is somewhat shallower in the Kearney (36\u00b0) and Creevan zones (41\u00b0) than in the eastern and central portions of the Lack Inlier (49\u00b0) (Table 1, Fig. 13B, 13E, and 13J).\n\n\n5.2\nCavanacaw mineralised veins\nThe mineralised vein strikes range from NNE to WNW across both the Kearney and Creevan zones (Fig. 13A and 13D). However, the average vein strike differs between the Kearney and Creevan zones; being N\u2013S (171\u00b0\u2013351\u00b0) and NW\u2013SE (139\u00b0\u2013319\u00b0), respectively. The veins are typically vertical to steeply dipping in both zones (on average 69\u00b0 and 74\u00b0, respectively) (Table 1; Fig. 13A and 13D). Note that the mean dip values in Table 1 are likely to be an underestimate as vein dip only seems to have been measured and plotted on the trench maps when deviating from subvertical. The veins range in thickness from mm-wide veinlets to up to 3\u00a0m wide tabular veins (Figs. 8\u201311). They are typically, though not always, enveloped by clay-rich fault-gouge that can entrain clasts of mineralisation derived from the central vein(s) (Fig. 9). A sericite alteration zone that can exceed 5\u00a0m in width around the veins is also common, especially around the major veins. Host rock adjacent to the vein can also be mineralised, especially where heavily jointed and\/or faulted (Fig. 9B site 2). The major veins in both the Kearney and Creevan zones strike at a relatively high angle to the strike of the host rock foliation (typically \u223c45\u00b0; Fig. 13A and 13B, Fig. 13D and 13E), although the host rock fabric can vary significantly around the veins or swing into parallelism with the vein (e.g., Fig. 9).\nThe RioFinex trench plans in Fig. 9 present the most detailed vein and host rock maps and data for the Kearney vein which was captured in the northern exploration trench. It is hosted within a complex high-strain shear zone that causes the adjacent host rock to proximally swing into parallelism with the structure (Fig. 9). The Kearney vein is mapped to be continuous along strike in the trench and in underground exposure but does exhibit a classic \u2018pinch\u2019 and \u2018swell\u2019 geometry, ranging from 0.01 to 3\u00a0m in thickness (Figs. 9 and 10). The vein is also mapped to occasionally split into arrays of smaller veins (<1\u00a0m thick), such as in the centre of the northern exploration trench, before coalescing back into a tabular vein (Fig. 9B and 9C). Although the orientation of the broadly N\u2013S-striking Kearney vein is generally consistent in both the exploration trenches and in underground exposure, variations are common along the strike of the vein, including a prominent z-shaped buckle in the RioFinex southern exploration trench (Fig. 11B). Although less pronounced, similar z-shaped buckles are also mapped by Galantas in the Eastern Lagoon vein within the Kerr vein array (Fig. 10A), and in the Kearney vein underground (Fig. 10B).\nWhere the internal textures of the veins in the Kearney zone have been mapped in detail by Galantas, it is evident that the vein zones are assembled of relatively thick pods (up to 3\u00a0m) of massive sulphide and quartz breccia that are enveloped and connected by thinner (0.1\u20131\u00a0m) veins and zones of black clay-rich fault-gouge (Fig. 10). The mineralised pods are mapped to occur every 55\u201365\u00a0m along the strike of the Kearney vein underground (Fig. 10B). There are subtle differences in the strike of these two internal vein components: with the N\u2013S-striking mineralised pods striking slightly clockwise (179\u00b0\u2013359\u00b0) of the NW to NNW-striking black clay-rich fault-gouge veins (161\u00b0\u2013341\u00b0) (Figs. 10 and 13A). In the McCombs vein within the Kerr vein array, and in the Kearney vein underground, this produces an internal low amplitude, right-stepping geometry (Fig. 10). Unfortunately, the host rock foliation has not been mapped underground or in the Kerr exploration trenches to assess how this interacts with the different vein components.\nLike the veins in the Kearney zone, the veins in the Creevan zone are strongly deformed, and internally comprise of mineralised quartz pods and veins that are contained within a broader and complex zone of fault-gouge and alteration (e.g., Fig. 11A). It does appear, however, that the textures and kinematics of the Creevan veins change with structural orientation from WNW to NNE-striking (Fig. 13D). The major veins can be internally imbricated by late reverse shears which strike in the same WNW to NW-strike trend (detailed in next section), most evident at the Discovery vein outcropping along Creevan Burn and in the Sharkey vein trench map produced by RioFinex (Figs. 7H and 11E). The veins also appear to drag the foliation in a dextral sense, although no marker horizons are mapped to confirm this is the true shear sense along the structures (e.g., Fig. 11E). Like in the Kearney zone, an abrupt z-shaped buckle is recorded in the NW\u2013SE-striking portions of the strongly deformed Sharkey vein (Fig. 11C). Arrays of mm-wide veinlets striking NNE\u2013SSW (030\u00b0\u2013210\u00b0) appear to record WNW\u2013ESE (120\u00b0\u2013300\u00b0) dilational opening vectors in the Sharkey vein trench (Fig. 11E and 11F). Unlike the major veins in both the Kearney and Creevan zones, these subvertical veinlets strike at a relatively low angle to the strike of the host rock foliation (\u223c10\u00b0\u201320\u00b0) (Figs. 11F and 13D). These veinlets have been observed to cross-cut the major Creevan veins and alteration envelopes in the field and host disseminated pyrite and galena.\n\n\n5.3\nCavanacaw syn-mineralisation structures\nFaults that can be sulphide-bearing and auriferous are observed in both the Kearney and Creevan zones. This was perhaps most clearly illustrated in the northern Kearney exploration trench (Fig. 9). Here, a population of WNW to N-striking faults with variable, mostly NE-ward dips were observed to interact with the Kearney vein (Figs. 9 and 13G). The faults relate to the Luis Shear Zone in the north of the Kearney vein (Fig. 6A), but they swing from a NW\u2013SE-dominated trend outside the vein, to an NNW\u2013SSE-dominated and within the vein (Fig. 9D site 6). Many of the faults within the vein are intensely mineralised by sulphides (Fig. 9B site 2, 9D site 7 and 8), indicating that at least the sulphide-bearing faults propagated during the mineralisation; however, some may have been reactivated post-mineralisation as they can displace the subvertical vein in a dextral sense by up to 1\u00a0m in the north of the trench (Fig. 9D, site 6). Minor, shallower dipping faults with limited extent can branch from the steep NW to N-striking faults (especially in the NW trend) (Fig. 9D site 8, 13G). These can also be sulphide-bearing, although rarely. The kinematics of these shallow faults is unknown; however, it is notable that the Kearney vein is transected and \u2018stacks up\u2019 along faults in this orientation in the centre of the trench, implying reverse kinematic movement (Fig. 9C site 5). Mineralised and unmineralised joints which dominantly strike NNW\u2013SSE and dip steeply are also found across the northern Kearney exploration trench (Fig. 13C).\nIn the Creevan zone, the Discovery vein exposed along Creevan Burn is internally stacked along NW to WNW-striking and shallowly dipping reverse shears (Fig. 7H). Reverse shears in this orientation are also found in the Sharkey vein trench where they entrain the vein to produce flat lying \u2018slabs\u2019 of mineralised vein (Fig. 11E). In both cases, these hangingwall-to-SW to SSW reverse movements are relatively late in respect to the propagation of the veins (Figs. 7H and 11E), although, like similar shallowly dipping faults in the Kearney zone, these faults can also be sulphide-bearing with exploration trench maps uncovering and recording highly altered and auriferous examples (e.g., Alberts vein in Fig. 11D). On average, this composite fault population strikes NW\u2013SE (146\u00b0\u2013326\u00b0) and dips moderately to steeply (58\u00b0) towards the NE across both the Kearney and Creevan zones (Table 1; Fig. 13G).\n\n\n5.4\nCavanacaw post-mineralisation faults\nFaults that are barren and clearly cross-cut and displace the mineralised veins are observed in both the Kearney and Creevan zones. In the Creevan zone, a series of NE to ENE-striking (058\u00b0\u2013238\u00b0) and steeply (68\u00b0) NW to NNW-dipping faults, i.e., parallel to the Lack Shear Zone, displace the veins (Fig. 13H). This fault population is best evidenced in the Sharkey vein trench where these brittle faults displace the veins in a sinistral sense by up to 4\u00a0m (Fig. 11E). Along the Creevan Burn stream section, foliation drag further indicates that these faults may have been reactivated dextrally following the earlier phase of sinistral movement.\nIn both the Kearney and Creevan zones a population of reverse shears which strike NE\u2013SW (045\u00b0\u2013225\u00b0) and dip shallowly towards the NW (33\u00b0) cross-cut and entrain the mineralised veins (Figs. 8 and 9A site 1, 13I). When observed, they are typically discreet structures (cm-scale width) that branch from and exploit the penetrative foliation in the host rock. The thrusts produce shear bands within the foliation indicative of a component of dextral movement. These thrusts appear to be responsible for the tectonic repetition created in the Discovery zone (detailed in section 5.1.), with the strongly deformed, shallow NW to WNW-dipping graphitic pelite interval also entraining and dissecting the Discovery vein (Fig. 8).\nFinally, a series of WNW\u2013ESE-striking (118\u00b0\u2013298\u00b0), moderately to vertically (62\u00b0) NNE-dipping faults that displace the subvertical Kearney vein branches by up to 1\u00a0m in a dextral sense are observed in the central portion of the northern Kearney exploration trench (Fig. 9C, site 3 and 4; 13F). These faults have also been observed in the walls of the open excavation pit where they also have a normal component of movement evidenced by displaced marker host rock horizons. No examples of these faults have been observed in the Creevan zone.\n\n\n5.5\nRegional veins\nTo the east-northeast of the Cavanacaw site, several in-situ auriferous quartz veins outcrop north and east of Omagh town along the Rylagh, Erganagh, Glencurry, Glenhordial, and Mullaghcarn Burn stream sections (Fig. 3). These \u2018regional\u2019 veins typically outcrop in the banks of poorly exposed stream sections and vary in width from mm-thick veinlets to 0.5\u00a0m (e.g., Fig. 12\n\n\n). The regional veins have strikes ranging from NNE to NW with an average of 178\u00b0\u2013358\u00b0, and average dips of 74\u00b0 towards either east or west (Fig. 13K). All the regional veins observed cross-cut the NNE\u2013SSW-striking (029\u00b0\u2013209\u00b0) and moderately (41\u00b0) WNW-dipping limb of the West Sperrin Knee Bend, although the relative angles in which these veins strike in respect to the strike of the host rock foliation does vary (Fig. 13K and 13L). The thicker veins, such as the N\u2013S-striking Rylagh vein, clearly strike at a relatively high angle of \u223c45\u00b0 to the host rock foliation (Fig. 12). Many regional veins that strike NW\u2013SE at relatively high angles to the host rock fabric are also internally thrusted and strongly deformed, as is observed at Cavanacaw (Fig. 13K). In slight contrast to the thicker regional veins, mm to cm-wide sulphide-bearing veinlets observed along the Glenhordial and Rylagh Burn stream sections typically strike NNE\u2013SSW at a relatively low angle (\u223c10\u00b0\u201320\u00b0) to the host rock fabric (Fig. 13K and 13L). As in the Creevan zone, these subvertical veinlets are recorded in the field to have dilational WNW\u2013ESE (\u223c120\u2013300\u00b0) opening vectors from quartz growth crystals and offset markers. Sericite alteration of the host rock is also typically found in the zones of dilational veining. Although exposure is poor, later faults are occasionally found to interact and displace the regional veins, similarly to the Cavanacaw area (Fig. 12). Low angle reverse shears, which share geometric and kinematic similarities to the post-mineralisation, shallow NW-dipping reverse shears observed at Cavanacaw, are observed in the banks of the poorly exposed streams.\n\n\n\n6\nInterpretation: Structural evolution of the Cavanacaw site\nUsing the observations of geometries, kinematics, cross-cutting relationships, and textures, a deformation sequence has been established for the vein and fault systems observed at the Cavanacaw site (Fig. 14). The host rock lithologies and structural fabrics observed are consistent with the area being located on the overturned limb of the thrusted Sperrin Nappe, therefore, the Grampian event of ductile deformation is not discussed here (instead, refer to Alsop and Hutton, 1993a; 1993b).\n\n6.1\nA progressive model for the Cavanacaw vein system\nAs detailed below, the structural observations of the Cavanacaw vein system are compatible with progressive sinistral transpression which, therefore, may relate to either the Scandian or Acadian events of the Caledonian orogeny (Fig. 14A and 14B). Several transcurrent ENE\u2013WSW-striking faults that bound the Cavanacaw deposit and transect the Lack Inlier could have accommodated this sinistral transpression (such as the Cool Fault and Sperrin Fault to the NNW and the Lack Shear Zone and Omagh Thrust\u2013Castle Archdale Fault complex to the SSE; Fig. 5).\nThe mineralised veins have variable orientations, textures, and kinematics that are compatible with overall progressive deformation within a sinistral shear zone system (Fig. 15\n). Two main styles of sulphide-bearing veins are observed: (1) Veins that currently strike between N and WNW, show significant asymmetric buckling, dextral shearing, and reverse faulting, particularly in the Creevan zone. Veins in this orientation cross-cut a host rock fabric that is correspondingly rotated anticlockwise with respect to the average orientation of the host rock fabric in the Lack Inlier; and (2) NNE\u2013SSW-striking veins and veinlets showing more dilational textures with little or no shearing and buckling. The undeformed veins cross-cut the deformed veins and rotated host rock fabrics and must, therefore, be relatively younger. The orientation of these undeformed dilation-dominated veins is compatible with the interpretation of an overall NNE\u2013SSW-orientated \u03c31 (Fig. 14A).\nWe propose that all the veins initially formed in a tensile mode in response to an overall NNE\u2013SSW-orientated \u03c31 (030\u00b0\u2013210\u00b0) at an angle of \u223c45\u00b0 to the shear zone margins (075\u00b0\u2013255\u00b0) (Fig. 15). This is best supported by rotating the strike of the host rock fabrics that the deformed Cavanacaw veins cross-cut back to the regional ENE\u2013WSW strike (i.e., shear zone parallel) as it respectively rotates the strike of the veins back to \u223cNNE\u2013SSW (Fig. 15, cf. Fig. 1). The z-shaped (dextral-asymmetric) buckling geometries of the deformed veins is compatible with them having originally formed in this orientation and being progressively rotated into their current position (Fig. 15). The buckling indicates that the veins were accommodating shortening along the vein axes and antithetic (i.e., dextral) counter-shearing. Buckles with an asymmetry in the opposite sense to the overall shear direction are well documented in quartz veins that form in progressive shear zone systems (Fig. 1C) (e.g., Ghosh, 1966; Mawer, 1992; Harris, 2003; Lloyd, 2020).\nWe have not observed veins with intermediate strikes between NNE and N (Figs. 14 and 15). This potentially indicates that propagation of the veins was episodic during rotation rather than continuous (i.e., Fig. 1B and 1C rather than 1A). We explain this through the interplay between rotation, stretching and competence. Only once the quartz veins and their silicified alteration halos, which are rheologically more competent than the surrounding unaltered metasediments, were rotated into the orientation of maximum stretch (i.e., perpendicular to the \u03c31 axis), could a new set of dilational veins form; this is best seen in the Creevan zone (Fig. 15). Our progressive model allows the veins at Cavanacaw to dilate at different times relative to each other but, overall, within the same deformation phase rather than two separate events.\nIn detail, the relative motions are reflected within the deformed veins that show pinch-and-swell geometries, with quartz-rich sulphide-mineralised pods delimited by layers and shears of intensely deformed clay-rich fault-gouge. The pods are systematically orientated slightly clockwise with respect to the shears (e.g., Figs. 10 and 13A). This is compatible with the enclosing, right-stepping shears preferentially accommodating the bulk of the counter-shearing during the rotation. In contrast, the more competent pods appear to have buckled during rotation. Although the broad geometry of the swollen pods and pinched gouge veins could mistakenly be interpreted as stretching and boudinage, their spatial association with the z-shaped buckling suggests shortening, not extension.\nThe veins and host rock fabrics in the Creevan zone experienced the greatest degree of anticlockwise rotation (Figs. 8, 13D, 13E, and 15). The rotation is particularly strong at the Sharkey and Princes veins at the southern margin of the Lack Shear Zone (Figs. 6A, 11A, 11C, and 11E). The greater degrees of anticlockwise rotation have orientated the Creevan veins perpendicular to the \u03c31 axis, resulting in the veins showing both later compressional structures (internal imbrication; e.g., in the Discovery vein; Fig. 14A, 14B, and 15) and late dilational veins (e.g., in the Sharkey vein zone; Figs. 11E and 14A). The late structures are associated with the mineralisation as they can be individually sulphide- and gold-bearing and highly altered (Fig. 11D). The Creevan zone is located near the southern margin of the Lack Shear Zone (Fig. 6A). This shear zone must, therefore, have been active during the transpression, accommodating sinistral motion and the rotation within the southern part of the Lack Inlier. The less competent graphitic pelites at the contact between the Mullaghcarn Formation and the Glengawna Formation, probably played an important role in the localisation of strain (Fig. 5).\nThe overall stress field orientation (Fig. 14B) is further constrained by late strike-slip faults across the Lack Inlier. NW to NNW-striking, steeply dipping faults in the Kearney zone appear to have been reactivated in a brittle dextral sense, compatible with them being antithetic Riedel faults which moved late within the overall shear zone system (Fig. 9D site 6; 14B). A series of brittle, steep, ENE\u2013WSW-striking faults that displace the Creevan veins in a sinistral sense are also compatible with being synthetic Riedel faults in the overall shear zone system (Fig. 14B). These faults strike parallel to and are kinematically compatible with the Lack Shear Zone (Figs. 14B and 15).\nIn summary, according to our model the Cavanacaw vein system was initiated with mineralised, subvertical tensional veins forming in a \u223cNNE\u2013SSW-orientation within a progressive, ENE\u2013WSW-striking simple sinistral shear zone system; they were then passively rotated, while internally deforming through counter-shearing (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 15). Our observations and the model explain the formation of the metallic mineralisation with complex vein geometries within a single, progressive episode without the need to evoke separate deformation events.\n\n\n6.2\nCarboniferous structures\nThe brittle structures that do not fit the kinematic model related to sinistral transpression, and cross-cut some of the Cavanacaw veins, are evidence of a later episode of deformation. The deformation seems to have reactivated some of the pre-existing structures: e.g., at the Creevan Burn stream section where foliation drag indicates dextral reactivation of some of the ENE\u2013WSW-striking faults which record earlier sinistral movement. This phase also created new structures: e.g., in the Creevan zone this is manifested as shallow NW-dipping, unmineralised reverse shears (top-to-SE) that displace the earlier structures (e.g., the Discovery vein) and create the thrusted tectonic repetitions in the stratigraphy by exploiting graphitic pelites (Fig. 8). The kinematics associated with both the dextral reactivation of the ENE\u2013WSW-striking faults and the top-to-SE directed reverse shears is compatible with a switch back to broadly WNW\u2013ESE-directed compression and shortening, probably due to the peripheral effects of the Variscan (Hercynian) Orogeny (Figs. 4 and 14C; Mitchell, 2004). The reverse shears are also expressed regionally and at Curraghinalt (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000; Shaw et al., in prep). Our interpretation of a Variscan deformation phase is compatible with the published age data from low angle reverse shear clay-rich fault-gouge collected along the Lack Shear Zone and regionally (K\u2013Ar model ages of 327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000).\nIn addition to the described structures, steep WNW\u2013ESE-striking normal-dextral transtensional faults displace the Kearney vein (e.g., Fig. 9C sites 3 and 4). Their orientations may be compatible with the extensional, orogen-oblique component of the broadly WNW\u2013ESE-directed Variscan compressional regime (Fig. 14C) or the later Carboniferous extensional event that also created e.g., the c. WNW\u2013ESE-striking Newtownstewart Basin half-graben (Fig. 3); but further data is needed to better constrain these structures and their significance.\nThe structures associated with the late deformation are not auriferous or sulphide-bearing (excluding where earlier sulphide-bearing veins are locally entrained). Therefore, it seems unlikely that Carboniferous gold mineralisation, whether local remobilisation or the introduction of new gold, occurred at Cavanacaw as proposed by Earls et al. (1996) and Parnell et al. (2000).\n\n\n\n7\nRegional model and discussion\nFrom the interpretations outlined above, we have demonstrated that the Cavanacaw vein system initiated and was rotated within a progressive NE to ENE-striking sinistral shear zone system that was governed by an NNE\u2013SSW-orientated \u03c31 related to the Scandian or Acadian event (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 15) (Soper et al., 1992; Dewey and Strachan, 2003). From this, and the regional analysis presented (e.g., Fig. 13J, 13K, and 13L), we further suggest that the West Sperrin Knee Bend found to the north of Cavanacaw also formed simultaneously. The geometry of the West Sperrin Knee Bend is remarkably like the Creevan swing found locally at the south of Cavanacaw (Fig. 8). The regional, anticlockwise rotation of the foliation across the Newtownstewart region is compatible with progressive sinistral shearing within an overall NE to ENE-striking shear zone system; specifically, between the shear zone pair defined by the Pettigoe Fault and the Sperrin Fault\u2013Cool Fault system (Figs. 3 and 17). A mid-Silurian (U\u2013Pb zircon age of 426.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85\u00a0Ma; Cooper et al., 2013) minor calc-alkaline intrusive suite, \u201cthe Sperrin Mountains Suite\u201d, is spatially associated with the West Sperrin Knee Bend (Fig. 16\n\n). Cooper et al. (2013) documents that the orientation of the Sperrin Mountains Suite mainly reflects that of the country rock on the rotated NNE\u2013SSW-striking (029\u00b0\u2013209\u00b0) limb of the West Sperrin Knee Bend (see also e.g., GSNI 2007a; 2007b, 2008, and 2013). This is compatible with magma intrusion into the tensional domain (030\u00b0\u2013210\u00b0) of the overall stress system (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 17). The dating and the setting of the Sperrin Mountains Suite imply that the formation of the West Sperrin Knee Bend and, by implication, the Cavanacaw deposit was largely complete by the mid-Silurian and are therefore, Scandian structures rather than Acadian (c. 427 Ma) (Fig. 16). As there are indications of \u2018head on\u2019 Scandian NW-SE compression in the Dalradian Supergroup at c. 437 Ma in the north of Ireland, the West Sperrin Knee Bend and the Cavanacaw deposit must have formed after this (Alsop, 1996; Kirkland et al., 2013). It is interesting to note that the age of the Sperrin Mountains suite overlaps with the reactivated fault movements dated at the nearby Curraghinalt deposit (40Ar\/39Ar sericite age of 424.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\/3.6\u00a0Ma; Fig. 16; Rice et al., 2016). The Sperrin Mountains Suite age is also broadly similar to the age of the Tullagh Point Granite, northern Donegal, interpreted to be associated with a phase of relatively ductile sinistral shearing (U\u2013Th\u2013Pb zircon age of 422\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma; Fig. 16; Kirkland et al., 2008). In addition to the geochronological constraints outlined above, the relatively \u2018late\u2019 timing of the Sperrin Knee Bend during the Caledonian orogeny is further supported by: (1) the lack of any cross-cutting structures or fabrics compatible with Grampian deformation; and (2) the absence of any sedimentation patterns or facies changes to imply the structure has an even earlier, pre-Caledonian origin (both observations are also noted by Earls et al., 1996).\nAs with the Cavanacaw veins, it appears that the propagation of the auriferous quartz veins hosted within the West Sperrin Knee Bend (e.g., Rylagh, Glenhordial) occurred simultaneously with the anticlockwise rotation of the Dalradian rocks during overall sinistral shearing (Figs. 15 and 17). This is best evidenced by the relative angles in which the subvertical gold veins strike in respect to the rotated NNE\u2013SSW-striking strata (Fig. 13K and 13L). For example, the major Rylagh vein currently strikes broadly N to NNW at a relatively high angle (\u223c45\u00b0) to NNE\u2013SSW-striking foliation (Fig. 12). If the strike of the foliation along Rylagh is restored clockwise to the regional ENE\u2013WSW-trend, this would reorientate the strike of the vein to NNE\u2013SSW, which is parallel to \u03c31 interpreted at Cavanacaw and consistent with the vein initiating as a tensional fracture (e.g., Fig. 14A, 14B, 15, and 17). This further implies that the propagation of the main Rylagh vein occurred prior to, or in the early stages, of the passive rotation and the formation of the West Sperrin Knee Bend (Fig. 17). In contrast to this, the dilational veinlet arrays observed along Glenhordial and Rylagh Burn strike NNE\u2013SSW at a relatively low angle (\u223c10\u201320\u00b0) to the Dalradian strata. The vein orientation here is parallel to the modelled \u03c31 \u2013 \u03c32 plane at Cavanacaw and implies that the propagation of the sulphidic veinlets occurred after, or during the final stages, of West Sperrin Knee Bend formation (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 17). Regardless of their relative timings, both vein systems are broadly compatible with the progressive deformation model presented in this paper, and are likely to be coeval with Cavanacaw, i.e., mid-Silurian.\nRather than invoking an enigmatic and poorly constrained \u201cOmagh Lineament\u201d, we instead attribute the formation of the West Sperrin Knee Bend to spatial heterogeneities in the physical properties of the overriding Sperrin Nappe as it was accommodating orogen-parallel, sinistral shearing (Fig. 17). To the southwest of the West Sperrin Knee Bend, the inverted Upper Dalradian cover rocks of west Tyrone and south Donegal are juxtaposed against the pre-Caledonian basement gneiss of the Lough Derg and Ox Mountains Inliers (Figs. 2 and 17). In contrast to the amphibolite-facies Dalradian cover sequence, the rocks of the inliers have experienced granulite facies metamorphism and were exhumed from the lower crust (Max and Long, 1985; Sanders et al., 1987; Cooper and Johnston, 2004). From this, we suggest that the Lough Derg\u2013Ox Mountain Inlier block was relatively rigid and acted as a 'buttress' to the Dalradian cover rocks to the northeast as they were accommodating margin-parallel, sinistral shearing during the Scandian event (i.e., the \u2018buttress effect\u2019 after Beck et al., 1993) (Fig. 17). In this model, the outboard sliver of Dalradian rocks will have \u2018locked up\u2019 against the buttress and subsequently folded through the anticlockwise rotation of the strata, forming the West Sperrin Knee Bend across the Newtownstewart region (Fig. 17). The West Sperrin Knee Bend does not extend southeast of the Glengawna Formation\/Sperrin Fault and the Cool Fault into the Mullaghcarn Formation and Lack Inlier, with only local rotation found in these zones (e.g., across the Lack Shear Zone) (e.g., Fig. 17). We interpret that the strongly deformed graphitic pelitic rocks that largely define the Glengawna Formation\/Sperrin Fault and the Cool Fault may have, therefore, acted as a d\u00e9collement (Fig. 17). This accounts for why the late\/post-Grampian Curraghinalt deposit, which is largely hosted by the Mullaghcarn Formation structurally below the Glengawna Formation d\u00e9collement, does not appear to have experienced significant mid-Silurian structural reactivation or to have been rotated anticlockwise following its initiation (Rice et al., 2016; Shaw et al., in prep). To the northwest, the West Sperrin Knee Bend is further bounded by the Pettigoe Fault, which separates the structure from Grampian fold complexes farther northwest such as the Ballybofey Nappe (Alsop, 1992; 1994). Together, the ENE-WSW-striking and NNW-dipping Glengawna \u2013 Cool Fault \u2013 Sperrin Fault complex, with the NE\u2013SW-striking and SE-dipping Pettigoe Fault, form a pinch point at the northern end of Lough Erne, and define a wedge in which the West Sperrin Knee Bend could form (Fig. 17). It is notable that this \u2018pinch point\u2019 is bounded by the Lough Derg Inlier to the northwest and the Dromore High bouguer anomaly to the southeast, indicating that the \u2018pinching\u2019 geometry of the Caledonoid faults could potentially have been controlled by pre-existing and underlying structures and\/or rigid blocks (Figs. 3 and 17).\nThe interpretation that the West Sperrin Knee Bend formed during the Scandian event implies that not all the strain associated with the event was compartmented as sinistral strike-slip movement along orogen-parallel faults with little deformation between the faults, as previously assumed by e.g., Soper et al. (1992), Dewey and Strachan (2003), Chew and Strachan (2014). Instead, the West Sperrin Knee Bend indicates regional ductile deformation of this age in the Grampian Terrane of Ireland and Scotland (Fig. 17). The West Sperrin Knee Bend does exhibit remarkable geometric similarities to regional strike swings mapped in the Dalradian Supergroup rocks of Scotland: the most prominent of these is a 20\u00a0km-amplitude, s-shaped \u2018knee bend\u2019 mapped in the Dalradian strata between Braemar and Tomintoul in Aberdeenshire, northeastern Scotland (Stephenson and Gould, 1995; Stephenson et al., 2013). Like the West Sperrin Knee Bend, this major feature has also been interpreted to be relatively \u2018late\u2019 as it is not clearly associated with any minor folds or axial planar cleavages (Stephenson et al., 2013). Another \u2018knee bend\u2019 feature is a less abrupt strike swing that is mapped in the Dalradian rocks of southwest Argyll in western Scotland. Like the West Sperrin Knee Bend, this strike swing has also been historically attributed to an enigmatic and deep-seated, NNE\u2013SSW-striking crustal lineament (the \u2018Argyll Lineament\u2019) (Hutton and Alsop, 1996). Future work is needed to assess whether these regional strike swings in the Dalradian rocks of Scotland can also be accounted for by regional progressive rotation during Scandian sinistral transpression.\n\n\n8\nImplications for the evolution and metallogeny of the Grampian Terrane\nThe indirect dating of the West Sperrin Knee Bend and the gold-sulphide mineralisation through field relationship and age data from the Sperrin Mountains Suite, combined with the stress field and deformation model for all the discussed veins, strongly supports a mid-Silurian Scandian event age for most of the gold mineralisation in the western Sperrin Mountains (Fig. 14A, 14B, 15, 16, and 17). The Sperrin Mountains Suite age (c. 426.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85\u00a0Ma; Cooper et al., 2013) and the overall deformation style and compressional structures in all vein systems suggest that the deformation within the Grampian Terrane was transpressional during mid-Silurian (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 18\n). This is compatible with prevailing models which suggest that sinistral Scandian transpression in the Grampian Terrane began in the mid-Silurian (c. 430\u2013410\u00a0Ma; e.g., Soper et al., 1992) and was followed by an episode of sinistral transtension in Early Devonian (c. 410\u2013395\u00a0Ma; e.g., Dewey and Strachan, 2003; Cooper et al., 2016). Early Devonian ages have been obtained from Cononish and Rhynie in the Grampian Terrane of Scotland (Treagus et al., 1999; Mark et al., 2011; Parry et al., 2011; Rice et al., 2012); therefore, they seem to be 10\u201320\u00a0Ma younger than the west Sperrin Mountains gold mineralisation and temporally associated with the onset of regional sinistral transtension (Fig. 16). Although Treagus et al. (1999) favoured a transtensional model for Cononish, Tanner (2012, 2014) suggests that the structures at Cononish are more compatible with a broadly N\u2013S-orientated transpressional stress field, with the broader Cononish vein system further associated with the Periclinal Orchy Dome; a transpressional structure (Fig. 18). It is, therefore, still unclear whether the Cononish vein system formed under transpression or transtension. Regardless of this, both Cavanacaw and Cononish are considerably younger than the Late Ordovician mineralisation age at Curraghinalt (Fig. 16; Rice et al., 2016), which is associated with the late to post-orogenic stages of the Grampian event (Shaw et al., in prep).\nSeveral other auriferous and polymetallic vein systems with remarkably consistent orientations occur throughout the Laurentian Caledonides of Ireland and Scotland (Figs. 2 and 18): broadly N\u2013S-striking vein systems have been identified at Calliachar \u2013 Urlar and Coire Buidhe near Loch Tay, Scotland (Pattrick, 1984; Ixer et al., 1997), Croagh Patrick and Bohaun in western Ireland (Johnston and McCaffrey, 1996; Aherne et al., 1992; Wilkinson and Johnston, 1996; Lusty et al., 2011), and Clontibret and Clay Lake in central Ireland (Steed and Morris, 1997). Although comprehensive textural data is lacking to determine the orientation of vein dilation, the structures related to these vein systems imply that they are hosted by NW to NE-striking second-order Riedel, Antithetic-Riedel, and tensile fractures, which like Cavanacaw and Cononish, have kinematic frameworks compatible with overall NE to ENE-striking sinistral shearing and a broadly N to NNE-trending \u03c31\/\u03c32 (Fig. 18) (Tanner, 2014; Rice et al., 2018). Radiometric age data is still lacking from these veins, but their orientations and cross-cutting relationships with surrounding rocks are compatible with either Scandian transpression or late-to post-Scandian transtension, but not with Ordovician structures as with Curraghinalt (Tanner, 2014; Rice et al., 2018).\nThe implication from our model combined with data from other vein localities is that at least three gold-mineralising episodes, each associated with a specific tectonic and structural setting, occurred across the Grampian Terrane during the overall Caledonian orogeny (Fig. 16). The first episode during which the Curraghinalt deposit formed is confined within a 10\u00a0Ma episode in the Late Ordovician (c. 463\u2013453\u00a0Ma; Rice et al., 2016). The tectonic context at this time seems to have been orogen-oblique dextral transtension due to late-to post-Grampian relaxation of the thickened crust (Shaw et al., in prep). The present study constrains the second mineralising episode with the progressive formation of the Cavanacaw deposit, as well as other nearby gold vein occurrences (e.g., Rylagh, Glenhordial), to a relatively ductile episode of ENE\u2013WSW-striking sinistral transpression during the Scandian event, probably in the mid-Silurian (c. 430\u2013425\u00a0Ma; Fig. 16). The third episode, so far only dated in Scotland, seems to be 10\u201320\u00a0Ma younger than the \u201cCavanacaw phase\u201d and may to be associated with an episode of brittle sinistral transpression or transtension along Caledonian faults during the late- to post-Scandian event in the Early Devonian.\nFurther work is needed to determine whether the other, un-dated vein systems with similar structural architectures to Cavanacaw and Cononish are related to a mid-Silurian event (\u201cthe Cavanacaw phase\u201d) or an Early Devonian event (\u201cthe Cononish phase\u201d) in the Scandian. The age information, combined with structural data, across the Grampian Terrane could be very useful in targeting metallogenic vein exploration; but additional age data would also further help to constrain the tectonic evolution of the Grampian Terrane in Ireland and Scotland and the localisation of deformation and fluid flow during the later stages of the Caledonian Orogeny.\n\n\n9\nConclusions\n\n\n\n1.\nThe propagation and mineralisation of the economic, structurally complex vein system at Cavanacaw can be explained by a single progressive kinematic model. Rather than linking to two-stage deformation caused by NW\u2013SE-directed Ordovician, then Carboniferous, compression, the formation of the vein system can be more easily explained via progressive deformation and sinistral transpressional shearing along ENE\u2013WSW-striking transcurrent deformation zones. Comparison with regional data strongly suggests mid-Silurian age for this progressive deformation, linking it to the Scandian event of the Caledonian orogeny. All the sulphide-bearing structures in the complexly deformed veins at Cavanacaw and nearby regional localities can be readily explained by our progressive model.\n\n\n2.\nThe progressive deformation recognised at Cavanacaw may further explain both the occurrence of other metalliferous veins in the Sperrins (except Curraghinalt) and the formation of the regionally significant \u2018West Sperrin Knee Bend\u2019 which has historically been associated with the enigmatic Omagh Lineament. The formation of the regional structure and the structural observations from the veins are compatible with the anticlockwise rotation of the Dalradian strata expected within an ENE\u2013WSW-striking sinistral shear zone system. The age of a calc-alkaline intrusive Sperrin Mountains Suite dated by Cooper et al. (2013), that appear to have been intruded within the tensional domain of this shear zone system, is mid-Silurian and constrains the evolution of the shear zone system associated with the Cavanacaw and other metalliferous veins to c. 430\u2013425\u00a0Ma. Overall, the West Sperrin Knee Bend and similar structures in Scotland may be proof of penetrative Scandian deformation in the Grampian Terrane of Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\n3.\nThe interpretations suggest that three mineralising episodes, each associated with a specific tectonic and structural setting, occurred across the Grampian Terrane during the overall Caledonian orogeny. The Cavanacaw deposit is younger (mid-Silurian) than the nearby world-class Curraghinalt deposit (Ordovician); but probably up to 10\u201320\u00a0Ma older than the Early Devonian Cononish deposit and Rhynie gold occurrence in Scotland. The latter two probably formed during a later phase of brittle Scandian transpression or during a switch to transtension. The stress and kinematic regime inferred to be responsible for the veins at Cavanacaw do share similarities with Cononish and with other, un-dated but broadly \u201cLate Caledonian\u201d sulphide veins in the Grampian Terrane of Scotland and Ireland (Loch Tay area; Croagh Patrick; and Clontibret \u2013 Clay Lake) but more data, particularly age data, are needed from all vein systems to further investigate the localisation of deformation and fluid flow within the Grampian Terrane during the Silurian and Devonian.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor statement\nShaw JI: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Validation; Visualization; Roles\/Writing - original draft, Torvela T: Investigation; Supervision; Writing - review & editing, Cooper MR: Investigation; Supervision; Writing - review & editing, Leslie AG: Investigation; Supervision; Writing - review & editing, Chapman RJ: Investigation; Supervision; Writing - review & editing.\n\n","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFractures and faults are common geological features in the upper crust. Onshore, fractures and faults represent zones of weakness with generally high erodibility, controlling the location of important landscape features such as valleys and fjords. Offshore, similar structures offset sedimentary packages, impacting the permeability and fluid and gas pathways, which have implications for hydrocarbon exploration and CO2 storage projects. Understanding the formation and evolution of fault and fracture patterns in space and time is therefore an important task when we try to resolve the evolution of landscapes or to understand the pathways of fluids and gasses.\nWestern Norway has long been an important site for the study of rift processes and source to sink relationships along passive continental margins. The region is one key area where basement fault and fracture patterns both influence the onshore landscape and impact the distribution of sedimentary packages offshore (Redfield et al., 2005; Fossen et al., 2017, 2021; Scheiber and Viola, 2018). Deciphering the spatial and temporal evolution of complex fault and fracture patterns in metamorphic basement is challenging, and one needs to address the issues that follows: (a) the role of ductile structural precursors (e.g. Walsh et al., 2013; Skytt\u00e4 & Torvela, 2018), (b) the role of reactivation of fault systems under changing stress fields (Redfield et al., 2005; Scheiber and Viola, 2018) and (c) complexities in interpreting K\u2013Ar fault gouge data. The latter requires a good understanding of the thermal evolution of the study area and the complexity of fault zone architecture (Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Tartaglia et al., 2020).\nIn this study, we aim to unravel the spatial and temporal evolution of fault and fracture patterns in a so-far little-studied key area of Western Norway: the transitional area between the N\u2013S trending North Sea margin in the south and the NE\u2013SW trending M\u00f8re margin in the north (Fig. 1\n). We combine remote sensing lineament analysis with ductile foliation trace mapping to investigate the significance of ductile precursors for the subsequent brittle evolution. We then present an extensive field data set from brittle faults and fractures, highlighting the presence of both newly formed structures and structures reactivating older, ductile precursors. Observations of fault and fracture mineralizations help to constrain the relative timing of faulting activity, and K\u2013Ar fault gouge data provide absolute age constraints on faulting. By applying different approaches of paleostress analysis to our dataset, we then suggest a spatial-temporal model for the brittle evolution of our study area. We show that the area is dominated by strike-slip kinematics and that prominent phases of rifting offshore are less prominent in the onshore realm.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe bedrock in the study area consists of the following elements (Fig. 1): 1) Proterozoic gneisses of the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) (e.g. R\u00f8hr et al., 2004, 2013; Corfu et al., 2014; Wiest et al., 2021), 2) Proterozoic and Paleozoic ortho- and paragneisses of the Caledonian nappes (e.g. Furnes et al. 1990; Corfu and Andersen 2002), and 3) Devonian sedimentary rocks (e.g. Osmundsen and Andersen 2001). The bedrock is highly influenced by the Caledonian orogeny with the subduction of parts of the WGR to ultra-high pressure depths in the Devonian (e.g. Hacker et al. 2003, 2010; Kylander-Clark et al. 2007), translation of the nappes during the collisional phase (e.g. Roberts and Sturt 1980; Hacker and Gans 2005; Corfu et al. 2014), subsequent extensional collapse (e.g. Fossen 1992, 2010; Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998) and the associated formation of the Devonian basins (e.g. Seranne and Seguret 1987; Osmundsen et al. 1998; Braathen et al. 2004).\n\n2.1\nDuctile precursor structures\nThe WGR and the overlying Caledonian nappes experienced extensive shearing, folding and doming during the collapse of the Caledonian orogen, starting at about 410\u00a0Ma and leading to the formation of the main ductile precursor structures in the study area (e.g. Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Wiest et al., 2021). Several Devonian shear zones separate the orogenic root of the WGR from the overlying Caledonian nappes and the Devonian basins. The large-scale, corrugated detachment system of the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment Zone (NSDZ; e.g. Labrousse et al., 2004; Young, 2018) connects with the Bergen Arc Shear Zone (BASZ) (e.g. Wennberg 1996) to the south (Fig. 1a). The M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Complex (MTFC, Seranne, 1992), the Nordfjord Shear Zone (NSZ, Hacker et al., 2010) and the Lom Shear Zone (LSZ, Wiest et al. 2021) all show mostly ductile sinistral kinematics and acted as strike-slip transfer zones during transtensional collapse (Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Wiest et al., 2021). These structures are reflected in the regional foliation trends. Foliation trace mapping based on published foliation measurements shows E\u2013W to NE\u2013SW-striking foliations north of and along the Nordfjord, and E\u2013W to NW\u2013SE-striking foliations south of the Nordfjord, with several domes developed in the WGR (Figs. 2 and 3\na; Wiest et al., 2021). The foliation is dominantly flat to gently dipping, but steeper dips occur as well (Supplementary 1).\n\n\n2.2\nBrittle faulting\nFrom the Devonian onwards, the ductile structural pattern has been overprinted by repeated episodes of brittle faulting (Gabrielsen et al., 2002; Fossen et al., 2017, 2021; Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018), including the brittle reactivation of major ductile shear zones. North of the study area, the MTFC has shown repeated brittle activity in the Late Devonian, Permo-Triassic, Mid- and Late Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Cenozoic (Redfield et al., 2004, 2005; Osmundsen et al., 2006). Similar repeated activity has been documented from other regional faults: the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment fault in the Permian and Jurassic-Cretaceous (Braathen et al., 2004), the Dalsfjord fault (DF) in Late Permian-Early Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous times (Torsvik et al., 1992; Eide et al., 1994; Fossen et al., 2021), and the L\u00e6rdal-Gjende fault (LGF) in Permian, Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and the Paleocene (Andersen et al., 1999; Fossen et al., 2017; Tartaglia et al., 2020). Detailed analyses of minor fault zones and fracture patterns, mainly south of our study area, revealed early Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic-Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene episodes of brittle faulting (Ksienzyk et al., 2014, 2016; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Scheiber et al., 2019; Fossen et al., 2021).\n\n\n2.3\nBrittle evolution offshore\nThe onshore fault activity relates to two well-constrained phases of rifting in the North Sea (Steel and Ryseth, 1990; Roberts et al., 1995; F\u00e6rseth, 1996): 1) rift phase 1 during the Permian and Early Triassic affecting a wide area and showing general E\u2013W extension, and 2) the more localized rift phase 2 during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of which the extension direction is controversial. Several suggestions have been made for the latter, including E\u2013W extension (Bartholomew et al., 1993; Reeve et al., 2015), NE\u2013SW extension (F\u00e6rseth, 1996; F\u00e6rseth et al., 1997), or one or two phases of rotation throughout the rift phase (Dor\u00e9 et al., 1997; Davies et al., 2001). Similar phases of rifting have also been suggested for the M\u00f8re Margin in the Norwegian Sea (Talwani and Eldholm, 1972; Grunnaleite and Gabrielsen, 1995; G\u00f3mez et al., 2004; Theissen-Krah et al., 2017): 1) a first rift phase is constrained to early Permian-Early Triassic with a ENE-WSW extension direction, 2) a major NW\u2013SE directed rift phase in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, suggested to have ended by mid-Cretaceous, and 3) a last stretching event in Late Cretaceous and Palaeocene leading to the final break-up between Greenland and Eurasia in the Eocene. In this study, we aim at deciphering the structural evolution of the onshore transition zone between the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea rift systems.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nRemote sensing\nWe conducted foliation trace analysis and lineament mapping in ArcGIS to acquire an overview of the structural architecture of the region. We used foliation traces drawn by Wiest et al. (2021), which were manually interpolated between field measurements of foliations stored in the 1:50\u00a0000 and 1:250\u00a0000 bedrock map database of the Geological Survey of Norway (NGU). Manual extraction of lineaments is a qualitative method where the results depend on the operator, what map sources are used, and the scale used for mapping (Scheiber et al., 2015). Manual extraction of lineaments was conducted by the first author on digital elevation models (DEMs) and on vertical derivatives of the topography which is a map source not sensitive to illumination direction and was made in Seequent Oasis Montaj (Supplementary 2). Orthophotos were used to study specific lineaments in more detail and, in some cases, hillshaded DEMs were used for further analysis.\nA conservative approach was applied where only distinct linear topographic bedrock features that clearly represent the expression of brittle bedrock structures were included in the lineament map (see Supplementary 2). Lineament mapping was performed at three different scales (1:300\u00a0000, 1:200\u00a0000 and 1:100\u00a0000) and is presented as a synthesis map with lineaments from all scales (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.2\nStructural field work\nOur foliation trace and lineament analysis served as a base for choosing areas for fieldwork. In the field, we systematically collected fault and fracture data, including orientation, slip line orientation, fault rock type, fracture surface mineralization, sense of slip, geometric relation to the local foliation, and if present, signs of reactivation. For the sense of slip, we attributed each fault-slip measurement with a value based on confidence and preservation (C \u2013 certain, P \u2013 probable, S \u2013 supposed, X \u2013 unknown). We also collected fault gouge samples for K\u2013Ar geochronology.\n\n\n3.3\nK\u2013Ar fault gouge dating\nThe K\u2013Ar fault gouge analyses including separation into grain size fractions, XRD characterization and K\u2013Ar dating were carried out at the Geological Survey of Norway and a detailed method description is provided in the supplementary material (Supplementary 3). The samples were separated into five grain size fractions before dating: 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm, 2\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm, 0.4\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm, 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm and <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm. The mineralogical composition of each fraction was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were also inspected in terms of possible illite polytypes that may represent different generations of illite (Grathoff and Moore, 1996).\nTo study the mineralogical and crystallographic properties of the fault gouge samples, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at the Elmilab, University of Bergen. The gouge samples were first encapsulated in epoxy and surfaces were polished. Backscatter electron imaging (BSE) was done using a Zeiss Supra 55 VP. Element mapping and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was done by using a Thermo Fisher X-ray detector and the Pathfinder software. Only the fractions of 2\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm and 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm were studied under the SEM. The other fractions were too fine grained and did not reveal any useful information.\n\n\n3.4\nPaleostress analysis\nObservations of a brittle fault's plane and slip line orientation together with kinematic information can be used to deduce a local stress tensor under which the fault has formed (Angelier, 1979; Lacombe, 2012; Sim\u00f3n, 2019). When performing paleostress analysis, the measured kinematic data are inverted into a single reduced stress tensor. The stress tensor provides information about the orientation of the principal stress axes (\u03c31\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u03c33) and the stress ratio R. R indicates the relative magnitude of the principal stresses and is defined as (\u03c32 - \u03c33)\/(\u03c31 - \u03c33) (Angelier, 1984).\nTo perform paleostress analysis, we used the program WinTensor by Delvaux and Sperner (2003). The dataset was divided into local stations based on location size and number of included fault and fracture measurements. In Win Tensor, we did the following procedure: First, we applied the Right Dihedron method, which finds the best fit stress tensor for a given number of field measurements and which removes outliers. The selected stress tensor was further analysed with the Rotational Optimization method, where the stress tensor is iteratively adjusted to the data set. During this step, fault planes containing slip lineations but lacking information about sense of movement were also included. For each subset, measurements exceeding an alpha misfit angle of 17\u00b0 were rejected as suggested by Sim\u00f3n (2019). Alpha is the angle between the measured slip line and the theoretical slip direction according to the resolved shear stress on the plane. To evaluate the resulting stress field, we used the modified stress index regime R' (Delvaux and Sperner, 2003). R\u2032 is a numerical parameter ranging from 0 to 3: extensional stress regime (\u03c31 vertical) when R'\u00a0=\u00a0R; strike-slip stress regime (\u03c32 vertical) when R'\u00a0=\u00a02 \u2013 R; and compressional stress regime (\u03c33 vertical) when R'\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0+\u00a0R (Delvaux and Sperner, 2003). The following five categories of stress tensors are used (after Mattila and Viola (2014)): pure extension, R'\u00a0=\u00a00\u20130.75, transtension, R'\u00a0=\u00a00.75\u20131.25, pure strike-slip, R'\u00a0=\u00a01.25\u20131.75, transpression, R'\u00a0=\u00a01.75\u20132.25, and pure compression, R'\u00a0=\u00a02.25\u20133.\nFollowing the first order paleostress analysis at the local stations, we perform significance tests for the individual local stress tensors according to Orife and Lisle (2006). We arrange the test results according to amount of included fracture and fault measurements and the average alpha value. Further, we categorize the individual measurements of each station by fault surface mineralization and redo the paleostress analysis. The resulting local stress tensors are again tested according to Orife and Lisle (2006), a procedure suggested by Sim\u00f3n (2019).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nBased on the large-scale ductile architecture of the study area, we divide the study area into six subareas (Fig. 2): subarea A encompasses the area north of the NSDZ and NSZ; subarea B comprises the area along Nordfjord including the NSZ and parts of the NSDZ; subarea C represents the Bremanger Granitoid Complex dated to 440\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma (Hansen et al., 2002), which does not contain a ductile precursor foliation due to its high structural position within the Caledonian nappe stack; subarea D comprises the NSDZ south and east of the Hornelen Devonian basin; subarea E encompasses the most inland parts of the study area dominated by N\u2013S trending valley systems; and subarea F includes the southernmost part of the field area east of the NSDZ and north of the Sognefjord.\n\n4.1\nLineament mapping\n\nFig. 2 shows the lineaments identified within the different subareas. Three main lineament orientation trends are visible (Fig. 3b): 1) N\u2013S (yellow in Fig. 3), 2) NE\u2013SW (blue in Fig. 3) and 3) E\u2013W (red in Fig. 3). In subarea A, the NE\u2013SW trend dominates, whereas in subareas B and D, the E\u2013W trend dominates, following mainly the trend of the ductile foliation. In subareas C, E and F, the N\u2013S trend dominates, clearly cutting the trend of the main foliation (Fig. 3a and b).\n\n\n4.2\nField observations\nWe collected structural data from brittle faults and fractures at 620 field localities, representing 1385 individual fault and fracture surfaces with fault mineralizations and 452 slip lines on fault planes (Fig. 2, Supplementary 4). In general, the three main orientation trends identified from lineament mapping are also present in the field measurements within each subarea, except for the E\u2013W trend in subarea B, which is missing in the field data (Fig. 3b and c). The E\u2013W lineament trend in subarea B is therefore more likely an effect of the pervasive E\u2013W ductile foliation trend (Fig. 3a). In addition, the field measurements show that N\u2013S striking faults and fractures are more pronounced throughout the study area than what the lineament mapping shows, except for subarea D, where this trend is missing in the field data as well (Fig. 3b and c). The NW\u2013SE striking fractures and faults are minor in all subareas (green in Fig. 3).\nAt each location, we studied the relationship between the orientation of brittle faults and fractures and the local foliation. In subareas A, B and F, the NE\u2013SW fractures strike generally parallel to subparallel to the local foliation, whereas in subareas D and E, the E\u2013W brittle structures strike parallel to subparallel to the foliation. In general, the dip of the foliation is moderate to shallow, which is different from the steep dip of the fractures and faults (Supplementary 1). The N\u2013S striking faults and fractures cut the local foliation throughout the study area.\nThe dip of the measured faults and fractures is generally steep (Fig. 4\n and Supplementary 1). The slip line trends vary throughout the study area, depending on the strike of the corresponding faults, with a generally shallow plunge (Fig. 4). Slip line orientations show predominantly strike-slip kinematic indicators, with 248 strike-slip dominated faults, 125 oblique-slip faults and 79 dip-slip dominated faults observed (Fig. 2).\nBased on observed fault and fracture mineralizations, we assigned our field measurements to seven different groups, sorted according to inferred high-to low-temperature mineralizations (Figs. 4 and 5\n): 1) Discrete fracture surfaces characterized by aligned muscovite\/biotite and\/or stretched quartz, feldspar and hornblende (stretched host rock, SHR) were mostly observed in subareas B, E and F (Figs. 4a and 5a). The stretching of these minerals must have happened under relatively high-temperature and thus semi-ductile conditions. These surfaces are, in places, covered by epidote, chlorite and\/or quartz mineralizations (Fig. 5b). SHR surfaces have variable dip angles and they have been found both cutting and being parallel to the foliation with variable strike orientation (Fig. 4a). The observed kinematic indicators are mainly dextral or sinistral strike-slip to oblique-slip. 2) Surfaces with epidote, chlorite and\/or quartz are the most common mineralizations in all subareas (Figs. 4b and 5c). These surfaces do not show clear orientation trends. Steeply dipping surfaces showing slip lines with shallow plunge and strike-slip movements seem to be more abundant. Some of these surfaces contain two generations of slip lines (Fig. 5d). 3) Surfaces with zeolite mineralizations occur throughout the study area (Fig. 4c). The zeolite mineralizations vary in colour from white to pink to orange and occur as euhedral radial crystals or as striated fibres (Fig. 5e\u2013g). Zeolite often occurs on top of epidote and chlorite mineralizations and is the apparent younger mineral (Fig. 5e). The zeolite surfaces are commonly steeply dipping and generally strike N\u2013S or NE\u2013SW to E\u2013W, and when found alone, they rarely show any slip lines (Fig. 4c). 4) Surfaces with hematite are more common in the northern field area and are commonly found together with dark green chlorite (Figs. 4d and 5h). These surfaces have similar orientations and sense of shear as the surfaces with epidote, chlorite and\/or quartz (grey, Fig. 4d). 5) Surfaces with calcite (Fig. 5i\u2013j) are most common in subarea B (Fig. 4e). The calcite appears as thin mineral coatings or as bigger crystals, and both alone on surfaces or together with any of the above-mentioned mineralizations. If occurring together with other mineralizations, calcite is normally found on top and seems to be the younger mineral (Fig. 5i). We rarely observed slip lines on calcite, and no kinematic indicators were observed (Fig. 4e). 6) Faults containing cataclasite and\/or uncohesive fault rock such as breccia and gouge occur throughout the study area, with most observations in subarea B (Figs. 4f, 5k and 6). These faults show variable orientations with shallow to steep dips. Slip lines and kinematic indicators were rarely observed on the fault surfaces in direct contact with the gouge. If observed, it was commonly seen on other surface minerals and is plotted in the corresponding mineral stereoplot in Fig. 4 and only shown in grey for Fig. 4f. The observed cataclasites represent 5\u201380\u00a0cm thick zones of crushed host rock containing minerals like chlorite, epidote, K-feldspar, and zeolite (Fig. 5k). 7) A smaller group of faults contains other minerals like talc, K-feldspar or pyrite (Figs. 4 and 5l).\n\n\n4.3\nK\u2013Ar gouge dating\nIn total, 56 gouges from 43 different faults were sampled (Fig. 1b). We collected gouges from all the three main fracture orientation trends observed (Figs. 3c and 4f). Six samples from the two most dominant gouge-bearing fault sets were selected for K\u2013Ar gouge dating (i.e., N\u2013S and NE\u2013SW trending, representing the trend of the North Sea and M\u00f8re margins, respectively). For both the N\u2013S and NE\u2013SW trending fault sets, we chose to analyse three samples representing the coastal, central and inland region of the study area, respectively (Fig. 1b). Detailed results from XRD analyses are shown in Supplementary 5.\n\n4.3.1\nN\u2013S striking faults\n\n4.3.1.1\nVAH_116_1\nSample VAH_116_1 is from a W-dipping fault in the unfoliated Bremanger granodiorite that is exposed within a quarry (Figs. 1b and 6a\n). The main fault plane dips moderately towards the W (263\/39, dip azimuth\/dip) and contains slip lines oriented 263-45 (plunge direction-plunge) associated with normal (W-down) dip-slip kinematic indicators. Slickensides were observed on striated white zeolite on the fault plane. The sharp fault scarp can be followed for about 150\u00a0m, and the width of the exposed fault core is ca. 1\u20131.5\u00a0m (Fig. 6a). At the sample locality, the fault core consists of fault breccia with variable clast sizes, layers of gouge as well as layers of coarse-grained orange zeolite crystals. We sampled a ca. 3\u20136\u00a0cm thick gouge layer close to the hanging wall (Fig. 6a). The three larger grain size fractions contain smectite, quartz, K-feldspar, chlorite, illite\/muscovite and plagioclase (Fig. 7\na). BSE imaging of the coarsest fraction shows smectite replacing K-feldspar crystals (Fig. 7a). The two finest grain size fractions of the sampled gouge consist of smectite with possible traces of illite\/muscovite. Palygorskite may also be present as inferred from its characteristic peak at 10.4\u00a0\u00c5 (Supplementary 6). The K\u2013Ar dates show a slightly convex-upward age spectrum ranging from 155\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1\n, Fig. 8\na).\n\n\n4.3.1.2\nVAH_53_3\nSample VAH_53_3 is from a fault zone located along Rv651 north of Nordfjord (Figs. 1b and 6b). The host rock is a banded gneiss with a foliation oriented 128\/56. The fault itself measures 075\/85 with slip lines oriented 159-15. The fault shows strike-slip movement through slip lines on calcite but kinematic indicators were not observed. The fault consists of one 10\u201340\u00a0cm wide fault strand containing gouge and clasts of host rock and calcite. All grain size fractions are poorly crystalline as shown by broad diffractions peaks with low intensities. The two coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain mainly smectite with subordinate K-feldspar, chlorite and minor quartz, whereas the three finest grain size fractions are entirely dominated by smectite (Table 1; Fig. 7b). The finest fraction is monomineralic. BSE imaging of the coarsest fraction shows K-feldspar with smectite replacement textures (Fig. 7b). The K\u2013Ar dates show an inclined age spectrum with dates ranging from 124\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8a). The three coarsest fractions overlap within their uncertainties with a mean age of 123\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n4.3.1.3\nVAH_267_2\nSample VAH_267_2 is from a fault zone located along E39 at the southern end of Votedalen (Figs. 1b and 6c). The monzonitic host rock has a foliation oriented 125\/30. The entire outcrop is cross-cut by subvertical fractures coated with pink zeolite crystals and, in some places, calcite minerals in the centre (Fig. 6c, insert). There are two zones of fault breccia, where one also contains gouge. The orientation of the gouge-bearing zone is 261\/65 with a slip line of 355-13. The fault shows strike-slip movement on striated pink zeolite but kinematic indicators were not observed. The brecciated zone also contains epidote. Only four grain-size fractions could be extracted from the gouge sample (Table 1, Fig. 7c). The three coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain smectite, illite\/muscovite, plagioclase, zeolite, pyroxene, quartz, chlorite, and minor rutile, whereas the finest grain size fraction is monomineralic and consists entirely of smectite (Table 1, Fig. 7c). From XRD, the two coarsest fractions contain the 2M1 illite polytype (Supplementary 6). The K\u2013Ar dates show an inclined age spectrum ranging from 240\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 158\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8a).\n\n\n\n4.3.2\nNE\u2013SW striking faults\n\n4.3.2.1\nVAH_198\nSample VAH_198 is from a fault zone located along road 653 close to Volda (Figs. 1b and 6d). The host rock is a dioritic gneiss with a foliation oriented 071\/47. The fault is located close to a lens of amphibolitic gneiss. The fault zone is approximately 2\u00a0m wide and consists of five fault branches, where two of these contain gouge and are separated by fractured host rock (Fig. 6d). The sampled fault has an orientation of 122\/80 and a slip line of 204-25. The fault shows strike-slip movement on striated K-feldspar, but no sense of shear was observed. The coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain biotite, smectite, K-feldspar, chlorite, plagioclase, zeolite and traces of amphibole, whereas the finest grain size fraction consists of biotite, chlorite and smectite (Fig. 7d). Biotite was identified with XRD according to its 5\u00a0\u00c5\/10\u00a0\u00c5 peak proportion (Supplementary 6). The presence of biotite is also supported by chemical data from ICP-OES analyses which show high concentrations of both Fe and Mg in contrast to Al. The smectite content decreases with decreasing grain size fraction, whereas biotite content increases (Fig. 7d). BSE imaging from the coarsest fraction shows fractured K-feldspar decomposing along its rims (Table 1, Fig. 7d). The K\u2013Ar dates show a slight convex-upward age spectrum ranging from 194\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 180\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8b).\n\n\n4.3.2.2\nVAH_58\nSample VAH_58 is from a fault zone located along road Rv651 north of Nordfjord close to a major NE\u2013SW trending lineament crossing the valley (Figs. 1b and 2). The host rock is a banded gneiss with a foliation of 134\/61. The fault zone is about 1\u00a0m wide and exhibits two slip planes containing incohesive fault rock and having sharp boundaries to the host rock (Fig. 6e). The orientation of the sampled fault is 122\/55 with a slip line of 122-55. The fault shows dip-slip movement on striated K-feldspar, but kinematic indicators were not observed. The fault zone shows K-feldspar mineralization on the fault surface. The coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain epidote\/clinozoisite, chlorite, smectite, plagioclase, K-feldspar and quartz, whereas the finest fraction consists mainly of smectite, with minor chlorite (Fig. 6e). BSE imagining from the coarsest fraction shows fractured and cracked K-feldspars (Fig. 6e). The K\u2013Ar dates show an inclined age spectrum ranging from 191\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8b).\n\n\n4.3.2.3\nVAH_250_2\nSample VAH_250_2 is from a fault zone exposed along the construction road to the top of the Loen skylift at the innermost Nordfjord (Fig. 1b). The host rock is a monzonitic augen gneiss with a foliation oriented 033\/46. A 5\u20136\u00a0m long fault scarp is exposed along the road (Fig. 6f). The fault measures 336\/60 and the slip line is 261-19. The fault shows strike-slip movement on a fault surface containing striated chlorite, quartz and white to orange zeolite, but kinematic indicators were not observed. The fault plane bends off from an about 2\u00a0m wide zone of cataclastic rock containing clasts of the host rock, epidote, chlorite, zeolite, K-feldspar, and calcite in a matrix of epidote, chlorite, zeolite, K-feldspar and quartz (Fig. 5k). The sampled gouge layer is 10\u201315\u00a0cm thick and is partly covered with superficial deposits (Fig. 6f). The coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain chlorite, K-feldspar, smectite, zeolite, epidote\/clinozoisite, plagioclase and quartz, whereas the finest grain size fraction consists of smectite, chlorite, zeolite and K-feldspar (Fig. 7f). BSE imaging of the coarsest fraction shows K-feldspar being replaced by smectite (Fig. 7f). The K\u2013Ar dates show an inclined age spectrum ranging from 241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 129\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8b).\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nInterpretation\n\n5.1\nInterpretation of K\u2013Ar fault gouge age spectra\nIn recent studies, the \u201cAge Attractor Model\u201d (Torgersen et al. 2015a; Viola et al. 2016) has been used to explain how an inclined age spectrum (K\u2013Ar age vs. grain size fraction) defines a mixing curve between two end-members; the coarsest grain size fraction representing inherited host rock or early grown K-bearing minerals, and the finest grain size fraction representing K-bearing minerals formed under the last detectable faulting\/fluid alteration event. The amount of authigenic K-bearing mineral phases increases with decreasing grain size and the finest fraction (here <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) is generally interpreted to represent the last event of faulting (Torgersen et al., 2015a; Viola et al., 2016; Tartaglia et al., 2020). This model serves as a useful first-order interpretation, but several additional complexities have to be addressed when interpreting K\u2013Ar age spectra as described in the following.\nFirstly, all different K-bearing mineral phases which contribute to the age have to be identified, with possibly several inherited and several authigenic phases. Secondly, the effect of inherited K-bearing minerals from the host rock has to be estimated (e.g. Zwingmann et al. 2010), and thirdly, the possibility for fault reactivation and the generation of more than one phase of authigenic K-bearing minerals has to be taken into account (Torgersen et al., 2015a; Viola et al., 2016; Fossen et al., 2021).\n\n5.1.1\nK-bearing mineral phases\nOur mineralogical dataset shows that the following K-bearing minerals can contribute to the K\u2013Ar dates: K-feldspar (up to 20\u00a0wt% in some fractions), biotite (up to 65\u00a0wt% in some fractions), illite\/muscovite (up to 22\u00a0wt% in some fractions), smectite (up to 100\u00a0wt% in some fractions), and zeolite (up to 14\u00a0wt% in some fractions). Biotite, illite\/muscovite and K-feldspar have known average K-contents of 9\u00a0wt%, 6\/10\u00a0wt% and 14\u00a0wt%, respectively (Barthelmy, 2014). Smectite and zeolite are generally considered not to contain K in their crystal structure (Howie et al., 1992). It is, however, common to find smectite intercalated with illite due to smectite illitization (Altaner and Ylagan, 1997), which can be difficult to identify with XRD analysis at low concentrations (Bense et al., 2014; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber et al., 2019). For fractions consisting entirely of smectite, but giving a well-defined K\u2013Ar date, we therefore assume that the K-content in these fractions can be assigned to illite interlayers in smectite.\n\n\n5.1.2\nThe effect of inheritance\nThe gneisses of the WGR commonly contain K-feldspar, and this mineral is therefore an obvious candidate for inheritance in our samples. Dunlap and Fossen (1998) and Walsh et al. (2013) showed that the K-feldspar in the WGR cooled through \u223c400\u00a0\u00b0C at 400\u2013330\u00a0Ma and through \u223c200\u00a0\u00b0C at 330\u2013230\u00a0Ma. If a fraction consists solely of inherited K-feldspar, the K\u2013Ar date should be the age at closure temperature (200\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C, Reiners et al. (2017)). Alternatively, K-feldspar might be an authigenic growth phase depending on fluid geochemistry and PT conditions during faulting (Brockamp and Clauer, 2013; Torgersen et al., 2015b). In this case, euhedral crystal growth might be expected. From BSE images, we see that the K-feldspars (at least in the coarsest fractions) in our samples do not show crystal faces, but are rather replaced by smectite or fractured and decomposed along edges, indicating that they might represent inherited grains. Finally, inherited K-feldspar might have isotopically re-equilibrated during faulting (Zwingmann et al., 2010), and might even show younger cooling ages than the actual timing of faulting if the faulting temperature was higher than the closure temperature of K-feldspar (Koehl et al., 2018).\nBiotite is another candidate for inheritance and is abundant in sample VAH_198. Biotite is abundant in the host rock of this fault gouge, and it is therefore probable that at least some of the biotite is inherited. Earlier K\u2013Ar biotite dating from within the study area showed cooling of biotite through 300\u00a0\u00b0C at about 340\u00a0Ma (Lux, 1985). K\u2013Ar dating of biotite is, however, complicated (Kelley, 2002) and the interpretation of this age should be done with caution. If the biotite is inherited, we would expect to see the 340\u00a0Ma cooling age reflected in the K\u2013Ar gouge data from the coarsest fraction. Authigenic formation of biotite in fault gouge has not been documented in the literature so far, but cannot be excluded depending on fluid chemistry and PT conditions during faulting.\nIllite is commonly interpreted to represent an authigenic phase in fault gouges if located in crystalline and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Out of all the studied samples, VAH 267_2 appears to be the only one whose two coarsest fractions comprise 2M1 illite (Supplementary 6). Thus, we cannot rule out inheritance of host-rock muscovite. Muscovite is usually assumed to have an Ar closure temperature of \u223c350\u00a0\u00b0C (Harrison et al., 2009) and within the study area, muscovite 40Ar\u201339Ar ages are about 380\u2013400\u00a0Ma (Chauvet and Dallmeyer, 1992; Walsh et al., 2013). If some inherited muscovite is present, we would expect to see the dates of the coarsest fractions to converge towards the muscovite cooling ages, potentially making the dates older than the actual faulting age. However, depending on the PT conditions of faulting, inherited muscovite might become isotopically reset during faulting (Zwingmann et al., 2010).\nSmectite, like illite, is generally assumed to represent an authigenic phase in a gouge in magmatic or high-grade metamorphic host rocks, since it is a low-T mineral formed under diagenetic or hydrothermal processes (Reid-Soukup and Ulery, 2018).\nZeolite is a common product of low temperature (<250\u00a0\u00b0C) interaction between fluids and crustal rocks (Weisenberger and Bucher, 2010), and is therefore generally interpreted to represent an authigenic growth phase during low-temperature faulting. Zeolite has earlier been documented in fault zones in Norway (Tartaglia et al., 2020). Zeolites do commonly contain very little K, and we therefore assume the influence of zeolite on the K\u2013Ar gouge dates to be minor.\n\n\n5.1.3\nFault reactivation\nReactivation of a fault can potentially lead to several generations of authigenic illite\/smectite growth, adding additional complexity to the already complex mixing between inherited and authigenic phases. Unravelling the contribution from inherited or partly re-equilibrated phases versus potentially several generations of authigenic phases is in many cases not unequivocally possible, and many K\u2013Ar dates potentially represent mixed dates not representing any faulting event. We therefore in the following use a conservative approach, and state that some mixing cannot be ruled out even for the finest fractions.\n\n\n5.1.4\nN\u2013S striking faults\n\n5.1.4.1\nVAH_116_1\nIn this sample, smectite, K-feldspar and illite\/muscovite contribute to the K\u2013Ar dates. The cracked and irregular K-feldspars partly replaced by smectite are interpreted to represent inherited grains from the host rock. The three coarser fractions that contain K-feldspar have similar mineralogical compositions and yield dates of 155\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm), 152\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (2\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm) and 169\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (0.4\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm). These dates correspond mainly to K-feldspar and illite\/muscovite in the samples, since those have a much higher K-content than smectite. Both K-feldspar and illite\/muscovite might be either inherited from the host rock, (partially) reset or authigenic. We choose therefore not to attribute much significance to these dates. The two finer fractions contain smectite and illite\/muscovite with dates of 148\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm) and 115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm). We interpret the date from the 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction to result from mixed generations of authigenic illite and smectite, and the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction to reflect authigenic smectite with interlayered illite grown during faulting at 115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8a). Due to possible traces of illite\/muscovite in this fraction, we consider this a maximum age of faulting.\n\n\n5.1.4.2\nVAH_53_3\nIn this sample, smectite and K-feldspar contribute to the K-content. Dates for the three coarser fractions are similar and plot around 123\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma. Earlier studies (e.g. Torgersen et al. 2015a, 2015b; Scheiber et al., 2019; Fossen et al., 2021) interpreted similar overlapping dates among fractions to represent an extensive faulting event. The K-content from smectite is minor compared to K-feldspar, indicating that the K-feldspar should have an important control on the resulting dates. BSE imaging (Fig. 7b) shows that K-feldspar in the 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm fraction gets replaced by smectite and does not show euhedral crystal shapes as expected if authigenic. That all three grain size fractions yielded identical ages within the age uncertainties, despite variable K-content, suggests that the K-feldspar was isotopically reset at c. 123 Ma, which we tentatively interpret as an earlier period of activity along this fault (Fig. 8a). Similar ages have been detected elsewhere in Western Norway (Fig. 8c, Supplementary 8) and it is also similar to the ca. 115 Ma faulting age from VAH_116 (see above). The two finer fractions contain only smectite, where we interpret the 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction to be a mixed date rather than an individual faulting event and the youngest age of 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) to represent an age of faulting (Fig. 8a).\n\n\n5.1.4.3\nVAH_267_2\nVAH_267_2 did not yield an <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction. The coarser fractions contain illite\/muscovite, plagioclase and zeolite, whereas smectite is the only K-bearing mineral in the 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction. The decreasing content of illite\/muscovite with fraction size indicates that this might be an inherited muscovite component, which is further supported by the 2M1 illite in the coarsest fractions (Supplementary 6). We assume the K-contribution from plagioclase to be minor. The inherited muscovite, together with the inclined age spectrum indicates that the dates of the three coarser fractions represent mixed ages. We interpret the monomineralic finest fraction (0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm) to represent authigenic smectite\/illite growth during a faulting event at 158\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8a).\n\n\n\n5.1.5\nNE\u2013SW striking faults\n\n5.1.5.1\nVAH_198\nIn this sample, K-feldspar, biotite, zeolite and smectite are the K-bearing minerals contributing to the K\u2013Ar dates. This sample has an unusual composition since it contains biotite in all fractions, with biotite content increasing towards smaller grain fractions. Biotite Ar cooling ages in the area are typically 400-380\u00a0Ma (Lux, 1985), which suggests that the biotite has to be at least partially reset or authigenic. K-feldspar is assumed to be inherited, as indicated by its fractured and craked appearance in BSE images of the 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm fraction (Fig. 6g). Based on the concave-up age spectrum and unusual mineralogy with uncertain proportions of inheritend and reset or authigenic biotite, the significance of any of the dates from this sample is uncertain (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n5.1.5.2\nVAH_58\nIn this sample, K-feldspar, smectite and potentially plagioclase are the only K-bearing minerals contributing to the K\u2013Ar dates (Fig. 7e). From BSE images we see that the K-feldspar of the coarsest fraction is fractured, indicating an inherited origin. XRD analysis of VAH_58 shows that all fractions except the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fractions contain K-feldspar, and we assume these fractions to show mixed dates. The finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm), however, only contains smectite and we interpret the date of this fraction to represent authigenic smectite\/illite growth during faulting at 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n5.1.5.3\nVAH_250_2\nIn this sample, smectite, K-feldspar, potentially plagioclase and zeolite contribute to the K\u2013Ar dates, where the amount of smectite increases and K-feldspar decreases with decreasing grain size (Fig. 7f). Together with BSE images showing K-feldspar replaced by smectite, this indicates that K-feldspar, at least partly, is inherited from the host rock. This indicates that all fractions containing both K-feldspar and smectite represent mixed dates, and even the finest fraction, which still contains ca. 6% K-feldspar, would be older than the main smectite growth event. However, assuming an inherited K-feldspar age of >240\u00a0Ma, and a minor K-contribution from smectite, the age of the authigenic smectite component would need to be unrealistically low to pull down the age of the finest fraction to 129\u00a0Ma. Therefore, we suspect that some of the K-feldspar in the finest fraction might be authigenic or reset, as also interpreted for a gouge sample of the L\u00e6rdal fault by Tartaglia et al. (2020). The presence of zeolite in the gouge indicates that temperatures during faulting could have been up to 250\u00a0\u00b0C, a temperature where K-feldspar can grow (e.g. Mark et al. 2008; Brockamp and Clauer 2013). The date of the finest fraction of 129\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma still needs to be regarded as a maximum age of faulting (Fig. 8b). The age overlaps with the 123\u00a0Ma age of sample VAH_53_3 (Fig. 8a) and with similar ages interpreted from other faults in the study area (Fig. 8c, Fossen et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n\n5.2\nPaleostress analysis\nIn an attempt to model the stress field(s) which led to the observed fault and fracture pattern in our study area, we performed paleostress analysis using the software WinTensor by Delvaux and Sperner (2003). To highlight different aspects of our data set, we applied two different approaches to sort and treat the structural data during paleostress analysis: 1) a station approach, and 2) a fault mineralization approach.\n\n5.2.1\nStation approach\nThe station approach is suited to show local variations and the potential effect of inheritance of trends from ductile precursor structures. We assigned our field measurements to 24 stations (Fig. 9\n). The measurements assigned to each station are located within less than 100\u00a0m distance from each other. The stations are colour-coded based on the relationship between brittle fracture and fault measurements and the main ductile foliation at that station (Fig. 9g): 1) if the measured fractures are mainly parallel to the foliation, the station is blue, 2) if the measured fractures mainly cut the foliation, the station is orange, and 3) if fractures are both parallel to and cutting the foliation, the station is red. In addition, grey stereoplot background indicates stations where faults and fractures are dominated by mica mineralizations and strained host rock (Fig. 9b\u2013f). For each station, we conducted individual paleostress analyses (Fig. 9a\u2013f). The resulting paleostress analyses show filled arrows (Fig. 9) for stress tensors derived from seven or more faults and fracture measurements, and for stress tensors with an average misfit angle (alpha) of 5\u00b0 or less. Hollow arrows in Fig. 9 represent stress tensors derived from 5 to 6 fracture and fault measurements and an average misfit angle (alpha) higher than 5\u00b0, and are therefore considered less reliable. Details on these analyses and the mineralizations on fracture surfaces are found in the supplementary material (Supplementary 7).\nA total of 24 local stress tensors with R\u2019 classification were inferred, whereof seven are extensional, seven are transtensional, five are transpressional, four are strike-slip, and one is compressional (Fig. 9). Of the six transpressional and compressional local stress tensors, all except one (station 11) include fractures and faults parallel to the foliation, and five local stress tensors are from stations with mica\/stretched host rock mineralizations indicating the formation of these local stress tensors under relatively high temperatures. Subarea B is dominated by extension (Fig. 9b), subarea F is dominated by transpression (Fig. 9f), whereas the other subareas are not dominated by a spesific stress tensor (Fig. 9a, c-e). From the 22 local stress tensors where the extension direction (\u03c33) is (sub)horizontal (excluding station 17 and 18), 14 have \u03c33 plotting in the NW\u2013SE sector and 7 have \u03c33 plotting more or less E\u2013W, whereas 3 have \u03c33 plotting in the SW\u2013NE sector.\n\n\n5.2.2\nFault mineralization approach\nThe fault mineralization approach is suited to potentially unravel the relative timing of different paleostress fields, by modelling the local stress tensors based on fault and fracture mineralization (Fig. 10\n). In this approach, it is assumed that higher temperature mineralizations such as mica and semi-ductile strained fracture surfaces formed earlier than lower-temperature mineralizations such as zeolite and calcite. This relationship is confirmed by the observation of zeolite and calcite mineralizations having crystallized on top of higher temperature epidote, chlorite and quartz mineralization. Slip lines are often not observed on zeolite and calcite, but rather on epidote, chlorite or quartz. The general absence of slip lines implies that zeolite and calcite mostly crystallized on fractures formed during earlier faulting, and kinematic indicators associated with these faults and fractures are derived from the earlier mineralizations. Therefore, the resulting local stress tensors do not indicate the stress field for the time of calcite formation, but rather indicate what surfaces were reactivated during the time of mineralization. Details on the resulting stress tensors can be found in the supplementary material (Supplementary 7).\nSimilar to the station approach, we chose local stations with sufficient measurements for each of the mineral groups to obtain a local stress tensor. Note that the measurements included within one station are from a slightly larger area (<2\u00a0km, within the same rock types) than for the station approach. Local stations containing high T mineralizations and semi-ductile features, such as SHR, fit into two main local stress tensors: an extensional stress tensor with NW\u2013SE to WNW\u2013ESE extension direction, and a compressional stress tensor with NW\u2013SE compression direction (Fig. 10a). The local stations containing epidote, chlorite and quartz surfaces show three main trends: compressional stress tensor with NW\u2013SE compression direction, transpressional stress tensor with NW-SE compression direction, and strike slip local stress tensors with NW\u2013SE to E\u2013W \u03c33 direction (Fig. 10b). The local stations with zeolite measurements show strike-slip and extensional local stress tensors with WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction (Fig. 10c).\n\n\n\n5.3\nCombining paleostress and geochronology\nTo correlate our fault gouge ages with the modelled paleostress regimes, we identified the local stress tensors to which the fault planes for each dated fault were assigned in the two different paleostress approaches (Figs. 9 and 10\n). Note that the sense of slip observed on a fault's plane might not be directly related to the event of faulting which caused the authigenesis of the dated mineral phases. Only two of the dated faults fit into a local stress tensor, namely VAH_250_2 (maximum age of faulting 129\u00a0Ma) and VAH_116_1 (maximum age of faulting 115\u00a0Ma). In the station approach (Fig. 9), VAH_250_2 is represented in station 10, showing transtension with WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction, whereas VAH_116 is included in station 12, showing transtension with E\u2013W \u03c33 direction. For the fault mineralization approach (Fig. 10) both VAH_250_2 and VAH_116_1 contain striated zeolite on the fault plane surface. VAH_250_2 is included in a stress tensor showing strike-slip with a WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction (Fig. 10c), and VAH_116_1 in a local stress tensor showing extension with WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction (Fig. 10c). Comparing these two approaches, it appears that they nicely match and complement each other. The local stress tensor implies that the local stress regime had a WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction in the Early Cretaceous (129\u2013115\u00a0Ma).\n\n\n\n6\nReconstruction of the post-Caledonian brittle evolution\nOur data set represents the first systematic investigation of brittle fault mineralizations between Sognefjorden and the M\u00f8re Margin (Fig. 1), allowing us to establish relative timing based on formation conditions of the different mineralizations. In the following, we first discuss the relative timing of the lineament and fracture networks, followed by the brittle evolution of the study area from pre-Devonian times to the Cretaceous. Here, we integrate the results from our lineament mapping, fault mineralization mapping, K\u2013Ar dating and paleostress analysis with information from the literature.\n\n6.1\nNature and relative age of fracture networks\nFrom lineament studies and field data of fractures and faults, we detected two major trends in the fracture network striking N\u2013S and NE\u2013SW, and two minor trends striking NW\u2013SE and E\u2013W (Fig. 3b and c). The NE\u2013SW-striking fractures and faults represent a dominating lineament- and fracture set in the study area (Fig. 3b and c) and their strike is in many places parallel or subparallel to the ductile foliation related to the NDSZ, NSZ and MTFC (Figs. 2 and 3). In metamorphic terranes, it is commonly known that brittle structures often develop by geometrically following planar ductile discontinuities in the bedrock (e.g. Butler et al. 2008; Massironi et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2019). We do, however, also observe extensive NE\u2013SW-striking fractures and faults in the Bremanger granodioritic complex (Fig. 3, subarea C). Since the Bremanger granodiorite lacks any ductile deformation features, these faults must have either formed as a continuation of the (inherited) structures outside the granodiorite or they formed according to the given stress field affecting the isotropic granodiorite body. Similarly to the NE\u2013SW fractures and faults discussed above, the E\u2013W trending fractures and faults follow ductile precursors in several subareas (Figs. 2 and 3).\nThe N\u2013S trending fractures and faults in contrast seem to represent a newly formed conjugate set, without any ductile precursor (Figs. 2 and 3). These N\u2013S fractures and faults are dominant in most subareas (Fig. 3b), and N\u2013S striking lineaments are often related to large-scale valleys, particularly in the inner Nordfjord area (Fig. 2, subarea E). These N\u2013S striking lineaments have earlier been shown to be the most dominant lineament feature, both mainland and offshore Norway (e.g. Gabrielsen et al. 2002). The origin of this important fracture and fault trend has been debated. It has been speculated that these features follow long-lived Proterozoic zones of weakness (Gabrielsen et al., 2018). However, most of the N\u2013S features cut the earlier ductile Caledonian foliation, and do not seem to follow any older shear belts. Several of the main N\u2013S striking fault zones (e.g., Votedalen) formed within late Sveconorwegian intrusions (980\u2013930\u00a0Ma; Wang et al., 2021) with only weak ductile Caledonian overprint, supporting a post-Caledonian origin for these N\u2013S trending brittle features.\nOur K\u2013Ar fault gouge geochronology from the N\u2013S trending faults indicates faulting activity during the Jurassic to Cretaceous ca. 158, 123\u2013115 and 86\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8a). Other K\u2013Ar gouge ages from Western Norway indicate that some of these N\u2013S striking faults were also active earlier, in Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian-Triassic times, but mostly during the Jurassic (Fig. 8c, Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Fossen et al., 2021). These studies often relate the N\u2013S structural trend to rift structures formed during E\u2013W extension (e.g. Fossen et al., 2017; Gabrielsen et al., 2018). Offshore, similar observations have been made, where N\u2013S striking extensional structures formed during the rifting in the northern North Sea (e.g. Bartholomew et al. 1993; Dor\u00e9 et al. 1997; Reeve et al. 2015).\nInterestingly, the majority of N\u2013S striking faults and fractures in our data set does not show dip-slip movement as inferred from onshore and offshore interpretations but is rather dominated by strike-slip kinematics (Fig. 2). If these N\u2013S striking fractures and faults originally formed during E\u2013W extension as inferred during earlier studies, the faults must have been reactivated at a later stage creating the strike-slip kinematics. We interpret this as rather unlikely for the following reasons: very few fractures and faults having this orientation show dip-slip kinematics, the strike-slip kinematics are found throughout the region, and the faults and fractures have mostly subvertical dips, which is atypical for dip-slip faults. The N\u2013S fractures and faults are therefore interpreted to have mostly been formed well before the Jurassic rifting episode, possibly as early as the Late Devonian-early Carboniferous (Fig. 11d). In the following, we will attempt to reconstruct the post-Caledonian brittle evolution based on previous work, the fault mineralization approach and the dated K\u2013Ar fault gouges.\n\n\n6.2\nSilurian to Early-Devonian (Caledonian) compression\nThe probably oldest mineralizations are represented by stretched micas and\/or semi-ductile strained host rock minerals, often together with epidote\/chlorite\/quartz, indicating relatively high temperature during formation. From the station approach, five out of six stations with compressional or transpressional local stress tensors contain such surfaces (Fig. 9), indicating that at least some of these structures might have formed during Caledonian compression\/transpression (Fig. 11d). Similar compressional local stress tensors are found in the fault mineralization approach (Fig. 10a and b). Compressional stress fields have been recorded from the ca. 460 Ma Rolvsnes granodiorite on B\u00f8mlo further south (Scheiber et al., 2016). There, stretched mica revealed 40Ar\u201339Ar-dates of ca. 450 Ma formed under a NNW\u2013SSE transpressional stress field, whereas faults related to dykes intruding at 435\u00a0Ma formed under WNW\u2013ESE shortening. Caledonian compression was probably ongoing in our region until a switch to syn- and post-collisional extension occurred at around 400\u00a0Ma (Fossen, 2010).\n\n\n6.3\nMiddle to Late Devonian NW\u2013SE extension in an overall transtensional system\nApart from the compressional local stress tensors, high-T mineralizations also fit into ENE\u2013WSW to NW\u2013SE extensional\/transtensional local stress tensors (Figs. 9 and 10a). These features could be early post-Caledonian structures formed in the Middle to Late Devonian, around 400\u2013370\u00a0Ma, when rocks passed through the muscovite closure temperature in the region, as interpreted by Walsh et al. (2013). NW\u2013SE extension and brittle faulting in Early to Middle Devonian has been described from the Bergen area (Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Larsen et al., 2003) and further south (Scheiber and Viola, 2018). The NW\u2013SE extensional stress field is in accordance with early post-Caledonian penetrative ductile extension which was generally oriented towards the NW (mode I back-sliding, Fossen, 1992, 2010). The penetrative ductile extension was followed by a more localized (mode II) extension focused on large-scale shear zones, equally with top-NW shear sense in the south (Hardangerfjord shear zone, Jotun Detachment, Fossen, 1992; 2010). However, in our study area, the ductile extension direction is oriented towards the W along the NSD and top-to-the-WSW along the sinistral MTFZ (Fossen, 1992, 2010; Seranne, 1992; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001), interpreted to be the result of a large-scale transtensional system in the Middle to Late Devonian (Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998). In such a transtensional system, our derived NW\u2013SE extensional stress field could be explained as representing the orthogonal stretching direction in a strain-partitioned system, with the strike-slip component taken up along strands of the MTFZ (Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998).\n\n\n6.4\nLate Devonian to early Carboniferous strike-slip\nFractures and faults coated with epidote, chlorite, and quartz are the most common in the region (Fig. 4). These minerals form under a wide range of temperatures of ca. 400\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C (e.g. Bird and Spieler 2004; Inoue et al. 2009). Given the relatively slow cooling of the entire region (Dunlap and Fossen, 1998; Ksienzyk et al., 2014; Scheiber et al., 2016), the area stayed at temperatures of ca. 400\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C from the Devonian until at least the beginning of the Mesozoic, and fractures and faults containing these mineralizations could therefore have formed and\/or could have been reactivated during a long time span. In Western Norway, faults containing similar mineralizations have been interpreted to have formed and been reactivated from the Late Devonian-early Carboniferous to the Permian, with possible Mesozoic reactivation (e.g. Braathen, 1999; Larsen et al., 2003; Walsh et al., 2013).\nThe most prominent local stress tensors obtained from the fault mineralization approach represent strike-slip regimes (R'\u00a0=\u00a01.43\u20131.75) with a E\u2013W to NW\u2013SE \u03c33 direction and a N\u2013S to NE\u2013SW \u03c31 direction (Fig. 10b). Based on paleocurrent and structural analysis of the Devonian Kvamshesten basin, Osmundsen et al. (1998) proposed a model where NW\u2013SE extension and perpendicular NE\u2013SW shortening was overprinted by younger W\u2013E extension and perpendicular N\u2013S shortening from the Middle Devonian to the early Carboniferous, indicating two independent stress fields through time, with the \u03c33 direction rotating anticlockwise from NW to W through time. Alternatively, Osmundsen and Andersen (2001) proposed a model where the change in orientation of the extension and shortening directions mainly depends on the distance from the MTFZ, similar to the strain-partitioned transtensional model proposed by Krabbendam and Dewey (1998). From the fault mineralization approach (Fig. 10b), we see that the \u03c33 orientation turns into an E\u2013W trend when approaching the MTFC, whereas the stations towards Sognefjorden in the south show a tendency to a NW\u2013SE trending \u03c33. The same trends are partially reflected in the station approach (Fig. 9), which indicates a changing stressfield depending on the distance from the MTFC in Late Devonian and early Carboniferous, as proposed by Osmundsen and Andersen (2001) (Fig. 11d).\n\n\n6.5\nPermian E\u2013W extension (rift phase 1)\nA few E\u2013W pure extensional local stress tensors are present in the station approach. These local stress tensors are dominated by fractures striking N\u2013S and NE\u2013SW showing normal dip-slip to oblique-slip kinematics. Similar approximately E\u2013W to ENE\u2013WSW extensional stress fields are well known from SW Norway and along the M\u00f8re margin, and have earlier been interpreted to first initiate in the Permian and Early Triassic during rift phase 1 (e.g. Torsvik et al., 1997; Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Walsh et al., 2013; Fossen et al., 2017; Theissen-Krah et al., 2017; Scheiber and Viola, 2018). The W-plunging Dalsfjord fault (Eide et al., 1994) shows Permian ages from palaeomagnetic and 40Ar\u201339Ar dating, and K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages from Western Norway show a peak of activity in the early to mid Permian (Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber et al., 2019; Fossen et al., 2021) (Figs. 8c and 12a). Interestingly, this elsewhere important phase does not seem to be very prominent in our data set. Only few measurements fit into such purely extensional E\u2013W stress fields in the station approach, none in the fault mineralization approach (Figs. 9 and 10), and none of our K\u2013Ar gouge dates are present from this time span (Fig. 8).\n\n\n6.6\nLate Jurassic to Late Cretaceous WNW\u2013ESE transtension\nAll our four monomineralic K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages, the tentative faulting age of 123\u00a0Ma and the two maximum ages of faulting fall into the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous (Figs. 8 and 11). Five of the six ages post-date the well-known Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rift phase 2 (Fig. 11a; Gabrielsen et al., 1999; Viola et al., 2016; Fossen et al., 2017). Rift phase 2 probably represents crustal stretching, but the orientation of the stress field during this phase is debated, from NW\u2013SE or E\u2013W extension (e.g. Bartholomew et al., 1993; F\u00e6rseth, 1996; F\u00e6rseth et al., 1997; Reeve et al., 2015), or rotation from E\u2013W extension to NW\u2013SE extension to NE\u2013SW extension (e.g. Dor\u00e9 et al., 1997; Davies et al., 2001). Our oldest sample VAH_267_2 (158\u00a0Ma), associated with zeolite mineralization, does not fit into any of the local stress tensors from the fault mineralization approach (Fig. 10). However, the clear strike-slip kinematics of the fault (subhorizontal slip lines) indicates that this fault is not a typical dip-slip rift-related structure.\nThe five younger ages overlap with what seems to be two regional faulting events when combined with K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages documented onshore by others at around 130\u2013110\u00a0Ma (Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Tartaglia et al., 2020; Fossen et al., 2021) and 90\u201370\u00a0Ma (Scheiber et al., 2019; Tartaglia et al., 2020; Fossen et al., 2021) (Fig. 11a). These Cretaceous faulting events have been interpreted as a response to hyperextension along the Mid-Norwegian margin, resulting in cooling and exhumation of the onshore area (Fossen et al., 2017; Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Tartaglia et al., 2020) and coincide with two periods of suggested tectonic activity in the Norwegian Sea (F\u00e6rseth and Trond, 2002; Theissen-Krah et al., 2017). Two of the dated gouges, VAH_250_2 and VAH_116_1, show kinematics with a E\u2013W to WNW\u2013ESE trending \u03c33 and extensional to strike-slip stress tensors. The kinematics and resulting stress tensor could be partly inherited from the previous strike-slip stress tensor derived from epidote-chlorite-quartz mineralizations, but since some of the dated faults also contain striated zeolite and calcite, we interpret the derived local stress tensor to represent the prevailing stress condition during the Cretaceous (Fig. 11d).\nThe VAH_267_2 (158\u00a0Ma) and VAH_116_1 (115\u00a0Ma) faults contain synkinematic zeolites, indicating that the widespread low-T zeolite mineralizations could be primarily of Late Jurassic to Cretaceous age. Similarly, the VAH_53_3 fault (123 and 86\u00a0Ma) contains striated calcite, supporting the field observation that calcite mineralizations generally are younger than the zeolite mineralizations, possibly being of mainly Cretaceous age, in accordance with the interpretation of Watts (2001).\n\n\n\n7\nSummary and conclusions\nOur interpretation of brittle fault mineralizations, K\u2013Ar fault gouge data and paleostress analyses reveal the following brittle evolution for the area between Sognefjorden and the M\u00f8re Margin (Fig. 12e):\n\n(1)\nHigh-T fault surface minerals indicate NW\u2013SE compression in the Late Silurian to Early Devonian, followed by NW\u2013SE extension under semi-ductile conditions.\n\n\n(2)\nEpidote-, chlorite- and quartz-bearing fractures and faults are interpreted to have initiated mainly in the Middle Devonian to early Carboniferous, representing two distinct paleostress fields: (1) NW\u2013SE compression and, (2) strike-slip stress regimes with a changing \u03c33 direction from NW\u2013SE in the southern part of the region to E\u2013W in the northern part of the region. The changing stress tensor is interpreted to be due to increasing strain partitioning closer to the MTFC.\n\n\n(3)\nOnly a limited number of epidote-, chlorite- and quartz-bearing fractures and faults fit into purely E\u2013W extensional local stress regimes, and these could probably be related to rift phase 1 in the Permian to Early Triassic in the North Sea, though this phase seems not to be very prominent in our study area.\n\n\n(4)\nAll four K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages and the two maximum ages of faulting fall into the Late Jurassic to Cretaceous, with only one age overlapping with the well-known Late Jurassic offshore rift phase 2. The other five ages constrain two younger extensive faulting events under a WNW\u2013ESE transtensional stress regime with related fluid flow and precipitation of zeolite and calcite in Middle (123\u2013115\u00a0Ma) and Late (86\u201377\u00a0Ma) Cretaceous times. These two faulting events can be related to periods of increased tectonic activity in the Norwegian Sea.\n\n\n\nOur results show that the brittle architecture of the northern section of the passive margin of Western Norway is controlled by two dominant brittle precursor directions (NE\u2013SW and E\u2013W striking shear zones) as well as two newly formed, mainly strike-slip fault sets with conjugate orientations to the brittle precursors (N\u2013S and NW\u2013SE striking). The interpreted Late Devonian to early Carboniferous age of the N\u2013S trending lineaments is different from previous models where the important N\u2013S lineament population in Western Norway was interpreted to have mainly originated during Permo-Triassic or Jurassic E\u2013W rifting. The domination of strike-slip fault sets is different from the mainly dip-slip controlled brittle architecture of the southern section of the passive margin south of Sognefjorden, indicating a more prominent transtensional\/strike-slip regime from the Late Devonian onwards at the transition to the M\u00f8re margin. Our multi-method approach shows that detailed fault mineralization mapping is crucial for unravelling both kinematics and relative timing of brittle faulting, giving, combined with paleostress analysis, a more complete picture of the brittle evolution of the area than K\u2013Ar fault gouge geochronology alone.\n\n\nAuthor statement\n\n\u00c5se Hestnes: Conceptualization, Writing - Original Draft, Visualization, Formal analysis, Investigation.

Deformation is often associated with extrusion of continental fragments, observed in situations like India-Eurasia collision and SE Asia extrusion (Fig. 1\na; e.g., Molnar and Tapponier, 1975; Morley, 2002, 2013; Searle et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2001; Tapponnier et al., 1986), Arabia-Anatolia system (Fig. 1b; e.g., Kaymakci et al., 2010; Lyberis et al., 1992; Mantovani et al., 2006; Martinod et al., 2000; Perin\u00e7ek and \u00c7emen, 1990; Smit et al., 2010) or Adria-Europe convergence (Fig. 1c; e.g., Frisch et al., 1998; Neubauer et al., 2000; Ratschbacher et al., 1991b; Rosenberg et al., 2004; van Gelder et al., 2020; van Unen et al., 2019; W\u00f6lfler et al., 2011). In all these situations, indentation-induced deformation is affected by extension driven by the slab roll-back of another subduction zone (Fig. 1, see also Regard et al., 2005; Schellart et al., 2019; Sternai et al., 2016). This extension has a variable orientation (from parallel to perpendicular) with respect to the frontal shortening or the lateral strike-slip deformation taking place during indentation. The resulting multi-scale distribution of the bulk strain by connecting different kinematic types of deformation that cannot be explained by a uniform stress field is generally referred to as strain partitioning (e.g., Benesh et al., 2014; Cembrano et al., 2005; D\u2019el-Rey Silva et al., 2011; De Vicente et al., 2009; Glen, 2004; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013). Although it is known that slab-roll back can affect the large-scale deformation associated with indentation (e.g., Faccenna et al., 1996; Schellart et al., 2019), the mechanism of strain partitioning and deformation transfer between slab roll-back induced extension and indentation is not well understood. Previous research into indentation systems has demonstrated that the indenter geometry dominantly controls the strain partitioning and deformation transfer (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2021), which should be accounted for when studying the impact of the extension driven by slab roll-back.\nWe aim to understand the interplay of extension driven by slab roll-back and indentation-driven deformation, together with a quantification of the associated strain partitioning and fault kinematics. To this aim, we performed crustal-scale analogue modelling experiments designed to test the influence of the extension direction during indentation in terms of kinematics, distribution of deformation and the coeval formation and evolution of sedimentary basins. Image correlation methods were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse deformation patterns around the indenter. The analogue experiments were scaled and applied to the indentation of the Moesian Platform during the formation of the arcuate back-arc convex Carpatho-Balkanides orocline that was coeval with the back-arc extension driven by the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slabs (Fig. 2\n).\n\n\n2\nThe Circum-Moesian Fault System of the Carpatho-Balkanides\nThe Carpatho-Balkanides orogenic system of South-Eastern Europe (Fig. 2a) is a Cretaceous thick-skinned nappe stack whose formation was associated with the closure of the Ceahl\u0103u-Severin branch of the Alpine Tethys Ocean leading to the collision between the Dacia mega-unit and the Moesian Platform, a promontory of the stable pre-Alpine European continent (Fig. 2a and b; S\u0103ndulescu, 1988; Csontos and V\u00f6r\u00f6s, 2004; Schmid et al., 2008, 2020). Subsequent Cenozoic subduction, slab retreat and closure of the Carpathian embayment created the oroclinal bending and the present-day double 180\u00b0 curved geometry of the entire orogenic system (Fig. 2a; e.g., Csontos and V\u00f6r\u00f6s, 2004; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, 2005; Ustaszewski et al., 2008).\nThe southern part of the double 180\u00b0 orocline consists of the South Carpathians, the Serbian Carpathians and the Balkanides and has a backarc-convex geometry (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020) formed by oroclinal bending and dextral transcurrent motions of the Dacia mega-unit around the Moesian Platform (Fig. 2b; van Hinsbergen et al., 2020). This oroclinal bending was first accommodated by Paleocene \u2013 Eocene orogen-parallel extension in the South Carpathians (Matenco and Schmid, 1999; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, 2005; Schmid et al., 1998), followed by Oligocene-middle Miocene deformation along the Circum-Moesian Fault System (thick black lines in Fig. 2b), one of the largest European intracontinental strike-slip fault systems, accumulating up to 140\u00a0km of dextral offset, associated with coeval thrusting and normal faulting (e.g., Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2022). These faults have different orientations, connect and transfer the deformation along the entire orocline, from the South Carpathians in the north to the Balkanides in the south. The largest faults in the system are the Cerna and Timok curved strike-slip faults that have 35\u00a0km and 65\u00a0km of dextral offset, respectively, and connect with thrusting-dominated deformation in the frontal part of the South Carpathians and Balkan Mountains (Fig. 2b; see also Berza and Dr\u0103ganescu, 1988; Ratschbacher et al., 1993; Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2002).\nThe evolution of the Circum-Moesian Fault System was (partly) coeval with widespread extensional processes related to the roll back of the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slabs (Bennett et al., 2008; Matenco and Radivojevi\u0107, 2012; Horv\u00e1th et al., 2015, Andri\u0107 et al., 2018) where the latter probably controlled E-W extension in the Morava Valley Corridor, the southern prolongation of the Pannonian Basin, and affected the western margin of the Serbian Carpathians segment of the orocline, from Oligocene to middle Miocene times (Figs. 1c and 2a; Matenco and Radivojevi\u0107, 2012; Erak et al., 2017; Sant et al., 2018; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020). Additionally, the oroclinal bending was complicated by one other extensional\/transtensional deformation that affected the Serbian and South Carpathians during their movement around the Moesian indenter and the formation of the Circum-Moesian Fault System, driven by the Carpathian embayment slab roll-back kinematics (Figs. 1c and 2). In the prolongation of the Timok Fault (Fig. 2b), a late Oligocene \u2013 early Miocene period of transtension and extension led to the opening of the Getic Depression in the South Carpathians foreland, which was subsequently inverted and buried during the middle to late Miocene docking of the South Carpathians against the Moesian indenter (e.g., Matenco et al., 2003; R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013). This extension also created a number of presently E-W oriented intra-montane basins in the Serbian Carpathians (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020, 2022). These complex movements around the Moesian indenter are inferred to be driven by rotational kinematics of the retreating Carpathian embayment slab and the formation of a STEP (subduction-transform edge propagator) system at high depths beneath the South Carpathians (Fig. 2a; Govers and Wortel, 2005; Ma\u0163enco, 2017).\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nStarting from a published analogue modelling setup with a fixed indenter, around which a deformable material is translating and rotating (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2021), we have performed crustal scale analogue experiments to simulate deformation in the upper to middle crust around a rigid indenter under the influence of variable extension direction. We note that the unusual high complexity of strain partitioning requires a correlation with this previously published study. Our experiments are designed (Fig. 3\n) to simulate the impact of the variability in kinematic boundary conditions and provide the possibility of a direct analysis of deformation styles. Four different kinematic setups were chosen to compare the deformation transfer and strain partitioning for cases with and without an externally-driven extension affecting the indentation process. The applied extension was either N\u2013S (model 2), E-W (model 3) or coevally in both directions (model 3), consistent with the observed extension directions that affect the Carpatho-Balkanides orocline in its South Carpathians and Serbian Carpathians segments (e.g., R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2022). Below we describe the modelling setup and results in a relative geographic framework where north is oriented upwards in top-view figures (e.g., Fig. 3), in analogy to the geographic framework of the Circum-Moesian Fault System (Fig. 2).\n\n3.1\nModelling setup\n\n3.1.1\nModel geometry and kinematics\nThe indenter is made of a 2\u00a0cm thick rigid polyvinyl chloride plate with rounded corners (Figs. 3a) and 35\u00b0 margin inclination (Fig. 3c), approximating the geometry of the base of the Cretaceous nappe-stack thrust over the Moesian Platform (Fig. 2b; Ma\u0163enco, 2017 and references therein). The indenter upper width of 26\u00a0cm (Fig. 3a) correlates with the N\u2013S dimension of the Moesian Platform (Fig. 2).\nSimilar to Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021), the base of the deformable part of models is made of a mobile basal plastic plate and a fixed plastic sheet (Fig. 3). The 1\u00a0mm thick plastic plate (green in Fig. 3) underlies the entire model, including the rigid block. Through a bar and mechanical joints it is connected to a motor (Fig. 3a) that pulls it northward at a constant velocity of 2\u00a0cm\/h. The other, fixed 0.1\u00a0mm thick plastic sheet (grey in Fig. 3) is placed on top of the moving plate north of the indenter, while it is below the moving plate to the north-west. This change is implemented at the N\u2013S oriented cut in the middle of the moving plate (dashed green line in Fig. 3a). The purpose of this configuration is to prevent an E-W oriented velocity discontinuity along the northern margin of the indenter. This setup pre-defines velocity discontinuities (VD) in all models along the southern and western margins, as well as along the south-western corner of the indenter and along the cut in the moving plastic plate in the north (Fig. 3a).\nThe mobile plastic plate moves north-wards in all models and its movement is controlled by the fixed guide bar in the north (Fig. 3a), which results in a coupled translational and rotational movement (Fig. 3b). The rotational component of motion is controlled by a stationary pin protruding from below the indenter (fixed pin in Fig. 3a), creating a pole of rotation. The cut in the moving plastic plate enables its sliding and rotation around the stationary pin. The coupled translation and rotation takes place during the entire period of each experiment, resulting in the total northward displacement of the mobile plate of 9\u00a0cm and 10\u00b0 of clockwise rotation (Fig. 3b).\nThe difference between our models is the change in kinematic boundary conditions applied to the northern and western margins of the model, simulating different effects of extensional directions on the deformation transfer around the indenter. In model 1 (Fig. 3e) all model boundaries are confined, either by metal bars or sand, to prevent the silicone putty (see material properties below) flowing and creating extension. The effect of extension is simulated in models 2, 3 and 4 by (partially) opening lateral boundaries in the northern, north-eastern and western parts of the models, which allows for extension of the model by gravity driven flow of the viscous, silicone putty layer in direction perpendicular to the open boundary. For loading conditions applied in this study, the gravity driven average velocity of the flow is \u223c9.6\u00a0mm\/h (see also section 3.2). Model 2 (Fig. 3f) has open northern and north-eastern boundaries, which facilitates the flow of the viscous layer away from the indenter (i.e., to the north and north-east). Model 3 (Fig. 3g) has a partially open western boundary and allows the silicone putty to flow to the west until it reaches a confining bar, which is at a larger distance in the north compared to the south (Fig. 3g) introducing a displacement gradient which simulates the limited extension of the south-ward narrowing Morava Valley Corridor. In model 4 (Fig. 3h) the northern boundary is fully open (as in model 2) and the western boundary is open partially (as in model 3).\n\n\n3.1.2\nModel materials\nAll four models consist of brittle and viscous layers with the same rheological properties (Fig. 3a\u2013d). The 1.5\u00a0cm thick brittle layer is made of dry feldspar sand with a bulk density of \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a01300\u00a0kg\/m3, a cohesion of 10\u201350\u00a0Pa and coefficients of friction of 0.68, 0.55 and 0.61, representing peak, dynamic and reactivation friction, respectively (Willingshofer et al., 2005, 2018). The sand has been sieved to the grain size of 100\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcm. Thin marker horizons of black feldspar sand mark vertical offsets along faults in cross-sections. Horizontal offsets are shown by passive maker lines of black and pink feldspar sand placed on the model's top surface. In Fig. 3a, the outline of the sand layer in the model is shown with a blue line and where it is in contact with the indenter it coincides with the upper edge of the inclined indenter margin (Fig. 3a, c).\nUnderlying the feldspar sand, the 0.5\u00a0cm thick viscous layer (pink dashed outline in Fig. 3a, see also Fig. 3c) is analogous to the ductile crust below the brittle-ductile transition. It is made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS silicone polymer) putty that has a Newtonian behaviour for strain rates below 10\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 (Rudolf et al., 2016), with a density of \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0970\u00a0kg\/m3, no yield strength and an average viscosity of 2.8 104\u00a0Pa\u00a0s at room temperature (\u223c20\u00a0\u00b0C; Rudolf et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n3.2\nScaling\nWe scaled our models to nature according to principles of geometrical, rheological and kinematical similarities (Hubbert, 1937; Ramberg, 1981; Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986; Davy and Cobbold, 1991). When scaling lengths, we follow the previous analogue modelling study applied to the same natural case of the Carpatho-Balkanides by Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021). This means that 1\u00a0cm in our models corresponds to 7\u00a0km in nature, which yields a length-scale ratio L*\u00a0=\u00a01.43\u221910\u22126. With this length-scale ratio, 1.5\u00a0cm depth of the brittle-viscous transition in our models corresponds to \u223c10\u00a0km depth in nature, which is supported by the shallow seismicity and the crustal structure reported in the South and Serbian Carpathians (e.g., Dimitrijevic, 1994; Popa et al., 2018). Lithostatic stress at this depth in the experiments is 191\u00a0Pa, which corresponds to 280\u00a0MPa in nature, resulting in a stress-scale ratio of 6.82\u221910\u22127. Such stress conditions at the base of the brittle layer lead to a threefold increase of flow velocity of silicone as determined by separate gravity driven flow test, performed under loaded (1.5\u00a0cm feldspar sand on top of the silicone layer) and not loaded conditions. Following Brun (2002) strength profiles (Fig. 3d) have been calculated, which are representative for the initial model conditions. Externally imposed velocity, controlled by the engine, was used to calculate strength profiles for the strike-slip and compression regimes, whereas we used flow velocity of silicone putty under loaded conditions to calculate the strength of the viscous layer under gravity driven extension. Based on the flow properties of the viscous layer, we scaled velocity in our models for the strike-slip deformation, following Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021), by calculating a time-scale ratio (Hubbert, 1937) t*\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u221910\u221211, which yields a velocity ratio V*\u00a0=\u00a02.7\u2219104. It follows that a velocity of 2\u00a0cm\/h in our models scales to 0.65\u00a0cm\/yr in nature. This corresponds well with the 60\u201365\u00a0km displacement along the Timok Fault during \u223c10 Myr (Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2003; Schmid et al., 2020). Though the velocity scaling is tied to the strike-slip deformation, we note that the displacement rates along normal faults in the Getic Depression (0.4\u20130.6\u00a0mm\/y during the period of activity of the Timok Fault, estimated from normal fault offsets reported in Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013 and references therein) are significantly lower compared to the strike-slip faults (e.g., Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013). This correlates well with gravity driven and engine driven flow velocities in our models, although the difference between the two velocities in our models is lower than those in nature.\n\n\n3.3\nExperimental procedures, monitoring and analysis approach\nAll models are built and run in a normal gravity field and at room temperature (\u223c20\u00a0\u00b0C). During the experiment, extensional deformation creates depressions in models. In order to track deformation in these depressions (i.e., basins), when they become \u223c1\u00a0mm deep, we fill them with alternating layers of differently coloured sand using a funnel. This sand represents, in a simplified way, syn-kinematic sedimentation. To preserve topography at the end of each experiment, two post-kinematic layers of black and white sand are sieved on top to cover the entire model. Subsequently, water is sprinkled on the sand layers to increase cohesion in the sand allowing for sectioning of the experiments in order to obtain information on the geometry of deformation structures.\nTop-view photographs perpendicular to the model surface are taken at regular time intervals of 3\u00a0min, which corresponds to 0.1\u00a0cm of motor-induced northward displacement between two photographs. We use particle image velocimetry on these top-view photographs (PIVlab, Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014) to calculate incremental particle displacements for each pair of adjacent photographs in the time series. The obtained incremental displacement fields are inspected for the presence of very large displacements that represent data outliers. Such outliers form due to incorrect correlations and are removed by applying a magnitude threshold filter, followed by visual inspection and manual removal. Displacements in basins for time frames when syn-kinematic sedimentation is added cannot be correlated automatically. Therefore, for these few time frames in each model, displacements in basin areas are interpolated from basin margins. Displacement fields are further analysed using the methodology and Strain Map software of Broerse et al. (2021) and Broerse (2021) to calculate 2D average strain type at the surface during evolution of our models. In the end, we combine our 2D strain analysis with visual interpretation of top-view photographs and vertical-cross sections to infer 3D deformation in our models.\n\n\n3.4\nModelling limitations and simplifications\nThe laboratory time-scale of our experiments is 5\u00a0h during which deformation is induced by horizontal motion of a mobile plate as described in section 3.1.1. This relatively fast deformation allows for adopting an inverse density gradient of the model layers without influencing the modelling outcome. This simplification is justified because buoyancy driven vertical motions typically occur on laboratory time-scales of days (e.g., Cobbold and Szatmari, 1991; Brun and Fort 2004, 2011; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007; Warsitzka et al., 2015). Additionally, salt tectonic experiments have shown that syn-kinematic sedimentation significantly reduces diapirism even on longer time-scales (e.g., Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007; Brun and Fort 2011). We, therefore, consider that the buoyancy effect is negligible in our models and that no diapirism contributed to the overall deformation.\nFurthermore, our models do not account for isostasy, surface erosion and sediment transport, creating exaggerated topography in the contractional area in front of the indenter. However, this area is not the main target of our study as we focus more on the interaction between strike-slip and extension behind the indenter and along its lateral margin. As our models do not account for vertical temperature gradients, the viscosity of the silicone putty simulating viscous behaviour is constant with depth, which is considered acceptable in analogue modelling studies (e.g., Davy and Cobbold, 1991). All other simplifications follow Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nThe modelling results are presented as top-view photographs and average strain maps (Fig. 4\n \u2013 7) for key moments in the evolution of all 4 models (i.e., after 1\u00a0cm, 4\u00a0cm and 9\u00a0cm of northward displacement) and interpreted cross-sections (Figs. 4\u20137) portraying the final deep structure of each experiment. Furthermore, time-lapse map-view videos of each model (see Supplementary material) were used to derive kinematics and temporal and spatial evolution of fault pattern during deformation.\n\n4.1\nModel 1: reference model with closed boundaries\nIn this experiment, all sides are confined by metal bars or sand and the model shows a gradual transition from dextral strike-slip dominated deformation along the western indenter's margin through transpression around the indenter's SW corner to shortening-dominated deformation along the southern margin (Fig. 4). The evolution of this deformation transfer and fault pattern is gradual and increases its complexity through time.\nEarly in the deformation history, lateral movement along the western indenter margin is accommodated by en-\u00e9chelon NNE-SSW oriented Riedel shears (R in Fig. 4a, b) and a N\u2013S oriented strike-slip fault, which develops above the lower edge of the indenter's margin (1 in Fig. 4a and b). At the same time shortening south of the indenter is accommodated along the top-N basal thrust (Fig. 4a and b), which has no clear connection to the strike-slip faults.\nAfter approximately 4\u00a0cm of total northward translation (Fig. 4c and d), strike-slip fault segments connect to form a through-going N\u2013S oriented fault system (1 in Fig. 4c and d). North of the pole of rotation, this strike-slip system partitions deformation in a positive flower structure with shortening to transpression being accommodated along the margins of the system (red and orange in Fig. 4d) and strike-slip to transtension (green and light blue in Fig. 4d) in the centre of the deformation zone. Remnants of Riedel shears form NNE oriented curved splays within the strike-slip system (Fig. 4c and d). The strike-slip system transfers part of its offset south-east-wards to a basal thrust via transpressional NW-SE oriented faults (2 in Fig. 4c and d), during its gradual south-wards propagation (3 in Fig. 4c and d). Shortening in front of the indenter is also accommodated by a new back-thrust (Fig. 4c and d) and weak, distributed shortening farther to the south (pale red in Fig. 4d). In the area between the basal thrust and the back-thrust, minor extensional deformation (blue in Fig. 4d) accommodates the change from ramp to upper-flat surface of the indenter.\nThe first order style and kinematics of deformation remain similar until the end of experiment (i.e., after 9\u00a0cm of total northward translation; Fig. 4e and f), especially in the north, where the positive flower structure and north-east-ward splay remain with a similar geometry and strain pattern (Fig. 4e and f and cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 4g). To the south, the connection between the main strike-slip fault (1 in Fig. 4e and f) and the basal thrust remains active and linked up with the NW-SE transpressional fault (2 in Fig. 4e and f). A new complex strike-slip fault (4 in Fig. 4e and f and cross-section b-b\u2019 in Fig. 4g) with numerous low-offset splays propagates south-wards from the main strike-slip system and deforms the previously formed thrust wedge. South of the indenter, weak extensional deformation with numerous low-offset normal faults partially reactivates the back-thrust, while the bulk shortening is accommodated along the basal thrust (Fig. 4e and f, and cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 4g).\n\n\n4.2\nModel 2: open northern boundary\nThe open northern boundary in model 2 creates extension, which results in the opening of a large fault-controlled extensional basin north of the indenter (highlighted semi-transparent white area in Fig. 5\na, c, e). This basin reflects the interplay between extension and strike-slip deformation because the entire fault system north of the indenter connects towards SW to the N\u2013S oriented dextral strike-slip deformation. This strike-slip system further transfers deformation to thrusting on top of the southern indenter's margin. The latter feature has the same evolution, geometry and kinematics as in the model 1 for the entire experiment duration (Fig. 5).\nThe early strike-slip deformation along the western indenter's margin is accommodated by NNE-SSW oriented Riedel shears (R in Fig. 5a and b) and early N\u2013S oriented strike-slip faults (1 and 2 in Fig. 5a and b). To the south, fault 2 connects to the basal thrust, while to the north, Riedel shears connect to numerous normal faults that accommodate extensional deformation (3\u20137 in Fig. 5a and b). These normal faults dip either to the north or south creating small and isolated basins (e.g., between faults 6 and 7 and 4 and 5 in Fig. 5a) separated by ridges (such as between faults 4 and 7 in Fig. 5a, cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 5g). Closer to the indenter, these normal faults have curved geometries (3, 6 and 7 in Fig. 5a), controlled by the NW indenter corner, as they gradually transfer extension through transtension to strike-slip deformation (Fig. 5b).\nAfter 4\u00a0cm of northward translation, the strike-slip system is fully connected into a continuous multi-strand structure (10 and 11 in Fig. 5c and d). In the north, the small, early basins connect into a single larger basin with intra-basinal highs and sub-basins, while new faults (e.g., 8 and 9 in Fig. 5c and d) form to connect normal faults with the strike-slip system along the western indenter's margin.\nTowards the end of the experiment, the basin system in the north further enlarges with new smaller normal faults forming within its interior (e.g., 12 in Fig. 5e and f, cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 5g). The overall strain pattern north of the indenter shows intercalating regions of extension-dominated and strike-slip to transtension-dominated deformation. The latter are more frequent around the NW indenter corner where the basin is narrower and extension connects with strike-slip system (Fig. 5f, cross-section b-b\u2019 in Fig. 5g). Along the western indenter's margin, fault 2 propagates to connect with the main strike-slip system along an oblique thrust (13, Fig. 5e and f, cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 5g). To the south, the main strike-slip system (10 in Fig. 5e and f) completely inverts the narrow southern tip of the basin (cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 5g), creating a positive topography (cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 5g) during its south-ward propagation (14 in Fig. 5e and f).\n\n\n4.3\nModel 3: partially open western boundary\nThe\u00a0\u223c\u00a0E-W extension induced along the western model margin creates a distinctively different fault pattern along the western indenter margin compared to the previous two models (Fig. 6\n), where strain is partitioned into two sub-parallel\u00a0\u223c\u00a0N\u2013S oriented zones of combined dextral strike-slip, transtension and extension. To the south, strike-slip deformation is transferred to thrusting on top of the southern indenter's margin, which creates the same deformation pattern as in the previous two models.\nThe early-stage deformation is localized in two closely spaced, sub-parallel dextral strike-slip faults (1 and 2 in Fig. 6a and b), also associated with a weak extensional strain (blue in Fig. 6b). North-wards, these two faults splay to form NE striking faults around the indenter's NW corner (Fig. 6a and b).\nThe evolution of both strike-slip and E-W oriented extension leads to formation of two separate deformation zones, which connect where strike-slip deformation is gradually replaced by transpressive deformation at the southwestern indenter corner (Fig. 6c and d). The eastern of the two forms on top of the velocity discontinuity and is controlled by faults 1 and 2 (Fig. 6c and d), while the western deformation zone is slightly younger and is controlled by faults 3 and 4 (Fig. 6c and d). In both zones, subsidence in narrow basins (Fig. 6c) is controlled by dominant dip-slip faults, while strike-slip deformation affects central areas of the basins (Fig. 6d).\nWith progressing deformation, new faults with dominant strike-slip kinematics form within the two deformation zones (e.g., faults 5 and 6 in Fig. 6e and f). The gradual cessation of extension along the western model margin leads to basins inversion, mostly along the eastern shear zone. This is, for instance, observed in cross-sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 (Fig. 6g) where positive topography in the basin area (between faults 1 and 2), the offset at the base of the basin and deformed sedimentary infill indicate inversion of originally transtensive faults (1 and 2) and new strike-slip faulting (5). Strike-slip deformation becomes subsequently the dominant deformation along the western indenter's margin, where it propagates south-wards and overprints the earlier thrust wedge (e.g., fault 7 in Fig. 6e and f and cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 6g). The thrust wedge (cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 6g) displays the same structural pattern as in models 1 and 2 (cross section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 4g and cross-section e-e\u2019 in Fig. 5g) where most of thrusting is accommodated along the basal thrust, while a single back-thrust is reactivated by low-offset normal faulting.\n\n\n4.4\nModel 4: open northern and partially open western boundaries\nThe coevally evolving extensions along the northern and western model margins create a large extensional basin north of the indenter, which shows a combination of features observed in models 2 and 3. Extension is gradually transferred to dextral strike-slip and transtension that affects a wide area along the western margin of the indenter. South-wards, the strike-slip deformation is transferred to shortening like in all previous models (Fig. 7\n).\nEarly in the model evolution, the deformation along the western indenter's margin is accommodated by two N\u2013S oriented dextral transtensional faults (1 and 2 in Fig. 7a and b), which control a narrow basin in between. Distributed subsidence affects a wider area west of these two faults (blue in Fig. 7b), with no evident normal faulting at the resolution of the model. North-wards, strike-slip to transtensional faults curve around the NW indenter's corner to connect to transtensional to normal faults north of the indenter (3\u20138 in Fig. 7a and b). These normal faults dip north-wards or south-wards, creating several isolated basins (Fig. 7a, see also cross-sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g).\nAfter \u223c4\u00a0cm of north-ward translation, the isolated basins and intervening highs are connected into one large basin (Fig. 7c and d, see also cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 7g). This basin enlargement and connection with strike-slip deformation takes place along previously and newly formed normal and strike-slip faults (8\u201312 in Fig. 7c and d). West of the indenter, new normal faults accommodate the extensional component of deformation which further contributes to basin enlargement (13 in Fig. 7c and d).\nTowards the end of the experiment, the basin system expands, especially to the west of the main strike-slip zone where new faults (14 and 15 in Fig. 7e and f) accommodate subsidence at the transition from extension in the north to strike-slip and the extension in the west. North of the indenter, the structure of the basin is characterized by sub-basins separated by intra-basinal highs (cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 7g). In the area around the NW corner of the indenter where the two extension directions interfere, the structural pattern is more complex (Fig. 7e and cross-section b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g). In this area, strain is partitioned into extension-dominated and strike-slip-dominated regions (areas of blue and green in Fig. 7f). A distinct feature is a narrow zone of shortening to transpressional deformation located in the hanging wall of fault 3, which can be inferred from the strain analysis (Fig. 7f), but cannot be seen in cross-sections (i.e., no reverse displacement in cross-sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g). In our view, this feature is probably an artefact of PIV analysis and is related to rotation of the hanging wall of fault 3 (or footwall of fault 7; see cross-sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g). This block rotates (clockwise in sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g) around a horizontal axis due to the listric geometry of fault 3 (Fig. 7h). While the entire block moves away from the indenter due to extension, the rotation brings the segment of this block located away from fault 3 up and towards the footwall (Fig. 7h). In map view such displacement creates local apparent shortening (Fig. 7h). A similar, but less expressed, feature can be observed also in the model 2 above the fault 3 (Fig. 5). Towards the south, the basin narrows significantly (Fig. 7e and cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 7g) until the strike-slip deformation starts its transfer to transpression and creates a positive topography (cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 7g). The main strike-slip fault system (1, 2 and 9 in Fig. 7e and f) propagates south-wards (16 in Fig. 7e and f and cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 7g) and overprints the thrust wedge.\n\n\n\n5\nEffects of extension(s) on strain partitioning and deformation transfer around an indenter\nThe previous study of Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021) has shown that deformation transfer during indentation without an additional externally driven extension is controlled mainly by the geometry of the indenter. The new modelling results of this study exhibit similar features to Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021) for similar modelling setups (model 1) but differ for areas which are affected by extensional boundary conditions (models 2\u20134). All models show similar deformation patterns with the formation of a thrust wedge (overprinted by low-offset normal faulting due to gravitational collapse; compare cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 4g, cross-section e-e\u2019 in Fig. 5g, cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 6g and cross-section e-e\u2019 in Fig. 7g) with almost similar topographic height (4.4\u00a0cm, 4.3\u00a0cm, 4.1\u00a0cm and 4.3\u00a0cm for models 1\u20134, respectively) in the south and its transition to transpression and strike-slip south-west of the indenter (Figs. 4\u20137). This suggests that extension imposed on the north-western and northern model boundary did not affect the deformation at the southern and south-western model areas. In contrast, significant subsidence associated with transtension and normal faulting creating isolated or connected basins is observed along the northern, north-western and western indenter's margins in models that allow extension at their margins (models 2\u20134, Figs. 5\u20137).\nThis extension and resulting subsidence are driven by the flow of the viscous layer in the direction of the free margin(s). Such flow of the viscous substratum underneath the brittle overburden is always a combination of a Poiseuille (the largest flow velocity in the middle of the viscous layer) and a Couette (the flow velocity in the viscous layer increases upwards) flows (Gemmer et al., 2004, 2005). With the progress of extension and the formation of the sedimentary basins, the effect of the Couette flow increases in the area beneath the sedimentary basins compared to the Poiseuille flow (Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007). This leads to the thinning of, and in cases of extreme extension, to breaking of the viscous layer. Effects of the viscous flow velocities on the model evolution are related to the rheological and geometrical characteristics of the model layers (Weijermars et al., 1993; Gemmer et al., 2004, 2005; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007; Brun and Fort, 2011). In our models, we do not vary the rheology and initial thickness of our model layers and add syn-kinematic sediments in the same way (see section 3.3) in all models. Therefore, we consider that observed structural differences in our models are not related to the variability of the viscous flow velocities, but the general flow direction.\n\n5.1\nThe influence of the northern extension\nExtension along the northern boundary creates a NNE to ENE oriented displacement field in the area north of the indenter (Fig. 8\na) resulting in a large basin with a curved southern margin, controlled by the geometry of the indenter's NW corner. West-wards, the basin is bound by a strike-slip to transtensional fault system (Figs. 5e and 8d) that has numerous splays curved to the east, along which the connection with normal faulting is ultimately established. The extension evolves gradually, which results in a segmented basin that has several elongated depo-centres (yellow dashed lines in Fig. 8d), separated by intra-basinal highs of different elevation (red dashed lines in Fig. 8d; see also cross-sections in Fig. 8g). The largest basin depth is observed in the vicinity of the NW indenter's corner, reaching 1.5\u00a0cm (cross-sections 2 and 3 in Fig. 8g). South-wards, the basin narrows and becomes less deep, as the influence of the north-ward extension decreases. The southern tip of the basin is located at the transition of the curved NW corner to the straight N\u2013S oriented indenter's margin. This is the area where the main strike-slip deformation changes its kinematics, from transtension in the north to transpression in the south, while inverting the basin at the same time. This inversion results in the positive topography of the model and uplift of the basin floor (the elevation of the basin floor is, locally, higher than the original model surface in Fig. 8d; red arrows in cross-section 6 in Fig. 8g).\n\n\n5.2\nThe influence of the western extension\nWest-ward directed gravity spreading along the western model boundary combined with the north-ward motor-induced pull create a displacement field oriented towards NW (Fig. 8b), which distributes strike-slip deformation west-wards and adds a transtensional component. Such coupled strike-slip and extension partition the deformation in two elongated\u00a0\u223c\u00a0N\u2013S oriented transtensional corridors that control basin formation (Fig. 8e). These elongate basins merge south-wards and reach up to the centre of the N\u2013S oriented western margin of the indenter (marked by the dashed black marker line in Fig. 8e). With the cessation of the western extension, the strike-slip deformation takes over, inverting the basins, especially the one along the main eastern strike-slip corridor (Fig. 8e). This inversion is observed by uplift of the basin infill and its deformed floor (cross-sections in Fig. 8h), which implies that the relatively shallow basin system (less than 0.5\u00a0cm depth; see cross-section 3 in Fig. 8h) was deeper before inversion.\n\n\n5.3\nThe influence of the coeval and coupled bi-directional extensions\nWhen extension is bi-directional, the influence of extension along the northern boundary dominates over that along the western boundary, because more extension is applied along the former. The early model displacements are oriented to the NNW in the west, which changes to NE in the east (Fig. 8c). Similar to the model 2 (Fig. 8d), the northern extension creates a large basin with a curved southern margin and numerous elongated sub-basins and intra-basinal highs (Fig. 8f). These sub-basins are, in top-view, more often dissected, less continuous and wider towards the west when compared with model 2 (compare Fig. 8d with 8f). This is due to the north-west-ward flow of the silicone that distributes deformation over a wider area (compare Fig. 8a with 8c). The basin extends farther south-wards where the tip of the basin reaches central regions of the western indenter's margin, similar to model 3 (compare Fig. 8e with 8f). The basin reaches 1.3\u00a0cm depth (cross-sections 1 and 3 in Fig. 8i), which is \u223c13% less when compared with model 2, where the basin was about 1.5\u00a0cm deep, which indicates an extension and associated subsidence distributed over a larger area. The southern tip of the basin was likely inverted, which is suggested by the associated uplift resulting in positive basin infill topography (cross-section 6 in Fig. 8i). This inversion is the largest in the model with only northward extension and is lowest in the case when both extensions are present in the model (compare cross-sections 6 in Figs. 8g, 2 and 3 in Figs. 8h and 6 in Fig. 8i). Therefore, the northern extension controls the opening of a wider basin, the internal distribution of fault offsets, subsidence and the connection to the curved strike-slip faulting along the western indenter's margin. The west-ward extension creates a transtensional deformation regime with subsidence along N\u2013S oriented strike-slip faults, pulling and distributing the deformation towards the west, allowing for an additional, but relatively minor amount of subsidence west of the indenter.\n\n\n5.4\nImplications for the indentation processes\nExisting modelling studies that investigate indentation and resulting shortening indicate that lateral extrusion during indentation requires a weaker crust and\/or lithosphere rheology to be present laterally in the system (e.g., Ratschbacher et al., 1991a; Sokoutis et al., 2000; Rosenberg et al., 2004; van Gelder et al., 2017), associated or not with extension driven by slab roll-back (e.g., Faccenna et al., 1996; Philippon et al., 2014; Schellart et al., 2019) and sometimes coupled with a collapse and spreading of orogenic wedges (Faccenna et al., 1996; Kydonakis et al., 2015). When the lateral margins are confined, there is no lateral extrusion and deformation is transferred only around the indenter and partitioned between shortening, transpression and strike-slip deformation depending on the indenter geometry (Zweigel 1998; Luth et al., 2013; Schellart et al., 2019; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2021). These results imply that a form of extension or gravity spreading at a high angle to indentation shortening along one or multiple margins of the system is essential for lateral extrusion in indentation systems. Our models are in agreement with these previous inferences, but further imply that the amount of extension and thus space generated by this process is critical for lateral extrusion to occur. In cases of limited externally-driven extension, the structural complexity increases by adding an extensional component to indentation-induced deformation, but it will not lead to large-scale extrusion of fault-bound crustal blocks.\n\n\n\n6\nImplications for the evolution of the Carpatho-Balkanides\nThe Circum-Moesian Fault System associated with the Carpatho-Balkanides backarc-convex oroclinal bending partitions the deformation around the Moesian Platform indenter in a similar way as in our analogue models, from transtension and strike-slip to transpression and shortening (Figs. 2 and 9\n; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020, 2021, 2022). This deformation was coeval with roll-back of the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slabs that together created the observed bimodal back-arc extension (Fig. 9; see also Matenco and Radivojevi\u0107, 2012).\nOur models suggest that the extension and transtension north and north-west of the indenter can be indeed explained by the bimodal N\u2013S and E-W oriented extension. The roll-back of the Carpathian embayment slab pulled its upper plate creating the orogen-parallel N\u2013S, NE-SW to ENE-WSW oriented extension in the Serbian and South Carpathians and their foreland due to the corner effect of Moesia (e.g., Schmid et al., 1998; Matenco and Schmid, 1999; Ratschbacher et al., 1993; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown 4\u20136\u00a0km of maximum Oligocene - early Miocene subsidence in various locations within the Getic Depression (e.g., Matenco et al., 2003; R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013), which is smaller when compared with our models (1.3\u20131.5\u00a0cm in models scale to \u223c10\u00a0km in nature). Owing to the subsequent post-early Miocene basin inversion and burial to large depths (\u223c10\u00a0km) in the proximity of the South Carpathians, these studies were not able to establish a very precise internal geometry of the Oligocene - Early Miocene basin beyond a potential separation in northern and southern sub-basins by an intermediary high (e.g., Fig. 1b in R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011 or Fig. 7 in Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013), which connect gradually to the west and SW in the present-day geometry. Our bi-modal extension results (Fig. 8f) predict a similar geometry and furthermore suggest that the Oligocene - early Miocene sediment thicknesses are similar in transects across sub-basins, but with higher northern values in the central Getic Depression. Although the detailed fault geometry and distribution is somewhat different, the deformation transfer and interplay between Timok Fault strike-slip offset to N- to NE-wards transtension and further east-wards normal faulting in the Getic Depression shows clear resemblance with our north and bi-modal extension models (see R\u0103b\u0103gia and Ma\u0163enco, 1999; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013).\nThe size of the modelled basins, which reflects the combined effect of extension and strike-slip faulting, is for several reasons exaggerated when compared to the Getic Depression. Most importantly, extension rates are exaggerated in our models, which are, though smaller than the strike-slip rates, higher than extension rates in the natural case. At the same time, the contribution of the strike-slip deformation in the Getic Depression is higher in the natural case than in our models (e.g., Schmid et al., 2008, and references therein). Furthermore, we note that the position of the pole of rotation, which has been chosen following regional kinematic reconstructions and available paleomagnetic studies (e.g., Balla, 1987; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, S.M., 2005; Panaiotu and Panaiotu, 2010; van Hinsbergen et al., 2020), also impacts the amount of extension as a function of distance from the rotation pole. Our models do not account for pre-existing topography at the onset of basin formation in the South Carpathians (e.g., Moser et al., 2005), which directly impacts on the size of the resulting basins. In the natural case, the interplay of strike-slip and extension\/transtension was distributed not only in the Getic Depression but also in the central and western part of the South Carpathians, where transtensional and extensional basins, such as the Petro\u015fani, Caransebe\u015f-Mehadia and Bozovici basins (Fig. 2b) formed during Oligocene - middle Miocene and are controlled by interacting strike-slip and normal faults, both orogen-parralel and orogen-perpendicular (e.g., Ratschbacher et al., 1993; Linzer et al., 1998; Matenco and Schmid, 1999; Codrea, 2001; Moser et al., 2005; H\u00edr et al., 2016). Furthermore, the coeval interplay between strike-slip and normal faulting led to renewed deposition in the earlier formed Late Cretaceous Ha\u0163eg Basin of the South Carpathians (Linzer et al., 1998, and references therein). Nevertheless, these natural observations are also reflected in our models showing that transtensional\/extensional deformation affected a larger area than the present-day Getic Depression.\nThe geometry of the extension along the western model margin is very similar to the one of the orogen-perpendicular extension in the Morava Valley Corridor, which is probably driven by the Adriatic slab roll-back, affecting only the hinge area of the Carpatho-Balkanides back-arc convex orocline (Figs. 2 and 9, the westernmost side of the Serbian Carpathians bordering the Morava Valley Corridor, Matenco and Radivojevi\u0107, 2012; Erak et al., 2017; Sant et al., 2018; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020). This Oligocene - Miocene orogen-perpendicular extension decreases gradually E\u2212 and S- wards (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020), while extending with time during the middle Miocene to the SW into the external Dinarides (Andri\u0107 et al., 2018; van Unen et al., 2019 and references therein). Our modelling results show that the west-ward extension allows for the partitioning of strike-slip deformation into multiple sub-parallel strike-slip faults that merge into a single deformation zone along the western margin of the indenter. The connecting geometry and observed west-ward continuation of the orogen perpendicular extension is realistic in the model with bimodal extension when compared with the observed fault geometry and splaying characteristics (compare Fig. 2b with Figs. 7e and 8f, e.g., splaying the Timok offset along the Sokobanja-Zvonce and Rtanj-Pirot faults in Fig. 2b). These observations infer that the geometry of the Circum-Moesian Fault System requires the Morava Valley extension to be coupled with the oroclinal bending and orogen-parallel extension. The shallow (<1\u00a0km) E-W oriented intra-montane basins of the Serbian Carpathians (Fig. 2) were not reproduced by our modelling, possibly because of the limited gravity spreading created at the margins of our model, which does not completely reproduce the likely larger horizontal forces exerted by a slab roll-back, remaining a feature for further study.\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe studied the effects of externally driven extension on strain partitioning and deformation transfer around an indenter by the means of analogue modelling. We have built four crustal scale analogue models where the deformable crust is translated and rotated around a stationary rigid indenter, while the externally driven extension is simulated by allowing the viscous layer to flow in directions parallel and perpendicular to the indenter margins. This allowed a quantitative assessment of the effects of superposed extension on the evolution of a strike-slip dominated deformation zone during indentation.\nPrevious studies have shown that the indenter geometry controls the style of deformation and that strike-slip at the margin of the indenter is gradually connected to shortening in its frontal part. Our modelling results show that the additional extension with a direction parallel to the strike-slip zone is responsible for the opening of a large sedimentary basin behind the indenter, characterised by sub-basins and intra-basinal highs, which are controlled by strain partitioning between the curved strike-slip, transtensional and normal faults. Furthermore, this extension stimulates an increase in the strike-slip faults curvature by connecting them with the basin-controlling normal faults. The extension perpendicular to the strike-slip system distributes deformation away from the indenter, creating a strike-slip system splaying into two zones of transtensional to strike-slip deformation that connect in the south and accommodate additional minor subsidence along N\u2013S oriented transtensional faults. The modelling furthermore shows that bi-modal parallel and perpendicular extension controls the first-order structure and extent (west-ward and south-ward) of the subsidence in the basin.\nThe modelling results infer that the Circum-Moesian Fault System was affected by extensions in different directions driven by the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slab roll-backs. The extension in the north opened the Getic Depression, partitioned the strike-slip deformation and increased the curvature of the large Cerna and Timok faults and connected them with normal faults. The west-ward pull of the Adriatic slab added a component of transtensional deformation to the strike-slip system during the indentation by the Moesian Platform and contributed to splaying strike-slip deformation west-wards.\nOur modelling results demonstrate that the deformation transfer around rigid indenters can be significantly affected by far-field extension involving enhanced subsidence in newly formed basins, distributing deformation over a wider area and increasing in oblique kinematics along differently oriented faults, which create complex strain partitioning patterns.\n\n\nData availability\nAll raw unprocessed data related to this study are deposited in the Yoda data repository system of Utrecht University with the DOI number 10.24416\/UU01\u2013N7TDVH and can be accessed via: https:\/\/public.yoda.uu.nl\/geo\/UU01\/N7TDVH.html.

Well-established examples include mesothermal vein gold mineralization associated with ductile-brittle strike-slip shear zones (Robert et al., 2005; Micklethwaite et al., 2010; Wiemer et al., 2021), epithermal gold deposit hosted within brittle vein or dilatant fault networks at depths of less than 1\u00a0km (Simmons et al., 2005; Micklethwaite, 2009; Leary et al., 2016), and sediment-hosted (Carlin-type) gold mineralization associated with large-scale dip-slip faults (Hickey et al., 2014). Therefore, mineralizations associated with shear zones, veins and faults may be related to these pre-existing structural heterogeneities and\/or to the processes that operated when these tectonic structures were active.\nShear zones, veins and faults associated to a fault system often exhibit systematic patterns in their geometry and scaling properties (Cowie et al., 1995; Bonnet et al., 2001; Davis, 2002). These systematic patterns are the cumulative result of multiple displacement events in the tectonic structure (Sibson, 2001), thus having implications in the formation and spatial location of mineral deposits in the upper crust (Boullier and Robert et al., 2005; Woodcock et al., 2007). Mineral deposits controlled by geological structures were often formed by processes with episodic behavior. Textures of multiple overprinting phases of brecciation and crack-seal in veins hosting ore are typical examples of this behavior as a \u201cfault-valve\u201d structure (Sibson, 1990, 1992, 2020; Cox, 2005). These textures can indicate dilatant faulting and repeated episodes of highly focused fluid flow along the structure due to overpressure (Peacock et al., 2017a), prior to the new cementation and sealing by precipitation of material transported in solution.\nIn the upper crust, typical geometric features of shear zones and faults are segmentation, multiple en-\u00e9chelon segments, development of stepover zones (contractional and extensional), and braching at fault tips (Mann, 2007). Fault segmentation has been proposed to explain the spacing of mineral deposit clusters along structural systems (Robert et al., 2005; Micklethwaite et al., 2010). Mineralized faults and epithermal veins often comprise multiple segments that interact or link with adjacent segments across stepovers. Stepovers represent zones of more distributed strain, typically containing second-order structures such as branch faults, fracture networks and folds (Mann, 2007). Mineralization specifically is hosted in, or associated with, small displacement structures, some of which link across the stepover (Simmons et al., 2005).\nFaults typically provide the pathways for fluids, volatile and metals to migrate upwards from magmatic-hydrothermal sources towards the surface (Sillitoe, 2010, 2015; Heinrich et al., 2004; Hedenquist and Taran, 2013). In this shallow crustal environment, a subsurface volumetrically significant alteration domain can be formed when ascending acidic magmatic-hydrothermal fluids react with wallrocks (Cooke et al., 2014). The resulting lithocap is characterized by development of a lithologically and\/or structurally controlled zoned hydrothermal alteration, which provide criteria for epithermal mineralization exploration in conjunction to the geological structure (Hedenquist and Arribas, 2017).\nIn the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes (18\u00b0\u201328\u00b0 S), temporal and causal relationships between regional deformation, volcanic activity and related mineralization during Neogene are currently under discussion. The various alternatives proposed include: (1) variations in the regional stress-field that cause imbalance in a magmatic system close to the eruption (Sulpizio and Massaro 2017); (2) the (re)activation of crustal-scale N, NW and NE-striking fault zones that localize the volcanism (Riller et al., 2001; Trumbull et al., 2006; Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2014; Tibaldi et al., 2017); (3) volcanic chains location related to the intersection between orogen-parallel N-striking structures and transversal NW-striking structures (Chernicoff et al., 2002; Richards et al., 2006; Trumbull et al., 2006; Seggiaro et al., 2019); and (4) the formation of large volcanic collapse calderas in relation to NW-trending lineaments, the NW-directed transtensive deformation or the transfer of movement between N-striking faults from the early Miocene (Petrinovic et al., 2010, 2017, 2021; Norini et al., 2013, 2014; Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2017; de Silva and Kay, 2018; Seggiaro et al., 2021).\nIn order to shed some light on the matter, this paper present structural data at macroscopic and mesoscopic scales, fault-slip data inversion and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology data for volcanic rocks, hydrothermally altered lithological equivalents and associated epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization of the Quevar Volcanic Complex (QVC). The QVC is a large stratovolcano related to Neogene magmatism of the Central Andean Volcanic Zone, located in the Puna of the NW Argentina (Figs. 1 and 2\n\n; Kay et al., 1999; Quade et al., 2015; Petrinovic et al., 2017; Ramos, 2017). These data allow us to: (1) to determine the spatial and temporal relationships among felsic volcanism, hydrothermal alteration, epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization and diverse tectonic structures; (2) to establish the kinematics of faults measured in late Miocene volcanic rock; (3) to calculate the regional stress regime derived from the inversion of fault-slip data; and (4) to obtain the absolute age of the hosting volcanic rocks, the hydrothermal alteration and the associated epithermal mineralization. Finally, in conjunction with published regional data, we propose a structural evolutive model that integrates the volcanic, tectonic, hydrothermal alteration and mineralization processes in the QVC during the late Miocene.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nThe Altiplano-Puna plateau of the Central Andes\nThe geological domain of Altiplano-Puna is part of the Andean orogen, together with the Western Cordillera, the Eastern Cordillera, the Sub-Andean and the Sierras Pampeanas (Fig. 1). It constitutes a high elevation plateau (\u223c4\u00a0km above sea level, average) located east of the Central Volcanic Zone segment of the Cenozoic Andean magmatic arc, which is related to the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate (Allmendinger et al., 1997; Riller and Oncken, 2003; Ramos, 2009). The Puna is morphologically characterized by orogen-parallel N-trending mountain ranges cored by Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic rocks, separated by wide basins filled with Cenozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. In both the Puna and the Eastern Cordillera, the Lower Paleozoic and Cretaceous older structures controlled the Andean shortening, the architecture of the orogen and the evolution of the foreland basin during the Paleogene (Hongn et al., 2007; Norini et al., 2013; Quade et al., 2015; Montero-L\u00f3pez et al., 2017; Seggiaro et al., 2017).\nDuring the Cenozoic, the Altiplano-Puna plateau of the Central Andes was developed by the continuous subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate in a convergent margin setting. In the South American upper plate, the E to ENE-directed convergence developed E and W-vergent thrusts-and-folds systems sub-parallel to the Andean mountain range. This horizontal shortening produced the crustal thickening and uplift of the Puna plateau and the Eastern Cordillera, and was coeval with the deposition of thick syntectonic strata (Allmendinger et al., 1989, 1997; Marrett et al., 1994; Elger et al., 2005; Oncken et al., 2006; Giambiagi et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.2\nCalama-Olacapato-El Toro lineament\nThe general N\u2013S trend of the Andean folds and thrusts is locally rotated or interrupted by NW-trending structural lineaments (Fig. 1). Several authors relate the deflection in the trace of the regional Andean structures with the E to ENE-directed far stress field, which also produced the (re)activation and strike-slip motion on upper-crustal oblique fault zones or transfer zones, with displacements that can reach several tens of kilometers in the horizontal plane (Marrett et al., 1994; Riller and Oncken 2003; Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013; Seggiaro et al., 2019). These transverse structures have also controlled the distribution of late Cenozoic volcanism in the Central Andes, as well as the development of large volcanic collapse calderas (Riller et al., 2001; Ramelow et al., 2005; Richards et al., 2006; Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2014, 2017; Tibaldi et al., 2017), with associated hot springs and polymetallic mineralizations.\nIn the northern Puna, the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro lineament (COT) controlled the building of a NW-trending volcanic chain in the upper Miocene, composed of the Rinc\u00f3n, Guanaquero, Chivinar, Tul-Tul, del Medio, Pocitos and Quevar stratovolcanoes (Fig. 2; Matteini et al., 2002; Acocella et al., 2011; Petrinovic et al., 2017). The origin of the transverse lineaments has been related to changes in the convergence angle between the Nazca and South America plates (Marrett et al., 1994), the orogen-parallel stretching (Riller and Oncken, 2003; Riller et al., 2001), or with transfer zones between thrust systems (Seggiaro and Hongn, 1999; Petrinovic et al., 2010; Norini et al., 2013; Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013; Seggiaro et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.3\nNeogene stress-field evolution in the Altiplano-Puna\nThe Altiplano-Puna crust has been deformed for the last time during the Andean orogeny from the early Oligocene to the late Miocene. Following the Eocene onset of shortening at the western protoplateau margin, two main shortening peaks can be distinguished (e.g. Elger et al., 2005): early Oligocene (33-27\u00a0Ma) and middle\/late Miocene (19-8\u00a0Ma). This early compressional stage dominated by E to ESE-directed horizontal shortening and lithospheric thickening was followed by a late Miocene to Recent stage characterized N to NNW-directed horizontal extension, which controlled the storage and eruption of caldera-related magmas (Allmendinger et al., 1989; Marrett et al., 1994; Cladouhos et al., 1994; Riller et al., 2001; Elger et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2013; Daxberger and Riller, 2015). In the Western Cordillera, which represents the western margin of the Altiplano-Puna plateau, four stress regimes since the middle Miocene times have been described (Giambiagi et al., 2016): (1) an early to middle Miocene pure compression; (2) a late Miocene transpression; (3) a latest Miocene-early Pliocene phase characterized by partitioned normal and strike-slip faulting; and (4) a late Pliocene to Quaternary horizontal extension. The transition from a compressional to an extensional stress regime (sensu\nPeacock et al., 2017b) took place between 13-10\u00a0Ma and 8-5\u00a0Ma in the northern and southern Puna plateau, respectively. This change has been related to the increase in cortical thicknesses and regional topographic elevation to exceed threshold values in crustal strength, producing the orogenic collapse and the transfer of active shortening to the sub-Andean fold and thrust belt (Marrett et al., 1994; Cladouhos et al., 1994; Elger et al., 2005; Giambiagi et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.4\nQuevar Volcanic Complex\nThe Quevar Volcanic Complex covers an area of about 1,500\u00a0km2 of the Salta Province in the Argentinean Puna. Outcrops of their volcanic rocks are generally located above 4,000\u00a0m, reaching altitudes between 5,810\u00a0m and 6,130\u00a0m above sea level (Fig. 2; Robl et al., 2009; Grosse et al., 2017; Petrinovic et al., 2017). The volume of volcanic materials emitted is estimated at 550\u00a0km3, giving rise to one of the largest stratovolcanoes in the Puna.\n\n2.4.1\nLithostratigraphic units\nThe QVC includes the effusive centers of Cerro El Quevar, Cerro Gordo and Cerro Azufre, which are aligned with the NW-trending COT (Fig. 2). The QVC is made from bottom to top by the following late Miocene lithostratigraphic Formations (Fig. 3\n; Robl, 2003): Tajamar Ignimbrite, Rhyolites and Perlites, Quevar Dacite, Rumibola Andesite and Cumbres Dacite.\nThe Tajamar Ignimbrite outcrops on the N and SE flanks of the QVC. It constitutes up to 400\u00a0m-thick accumulation of pyroclastic flows of riodacitic to dacitic composition and K-rich calc alkaline geochemical affinity, have a late Miocene age (10.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma; K\u2013Ar whole-rock) and are genetically related to the Aguas Calientes caldera (Petrinovic et al., 2010, 2017, 2021). The Rhyolites and Perlites unit outcrops along the Quebradas Incahuasi and Quir\u00f3n in the S and SW sectors of the QVC. It is made up of a devitrified rhyolitic extrusive dome, with brecciated and perlitic intrusive contacts. The Quevar Dacite constitutes the most extensive unit in the QVC and is made up of dacitic lavas and more subordinate pyroclastic deposits of block and ash flows emitted from various eruptive centers (Robl et al., 2009). In the Quebrada Incahuasi these deposits overlain the Rhyolites and Perlites unit. Typically, the dacites contain abundant phenocrysts of plagioclase and less abundant of pyroxene, hornblende, and biotite. Quartz phenocrysts are rare or absent. They include hornblende and plagioclase-rich mafic enclaves, suggesting a mixing of mafic and felsic magmas. The Rumibola Andesite unconformably overlain the Quevar Dacite. It includes the Azufre Andesite Member, which is composed of the andesitic lavas that outcrop at the Cerros Mamaturi and Quir\u00f3n, as well as in the sector between the Cerros Azufre and Gordo. The Azufre Andesite thus records the transfer of volcanic activity to the SW sector of the QVC. The breccia and fumarolic sulfur deposits of Cerro Azufre define a semicircular structure related to a chimney of the volcano (Robl et al., 2009). The Esquina Azul Andesite Member integrates the andesitic-basaltic lavas emitted in the N sector of the QVC, which has provided an age of 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma (K\u2013Ar whole-rock; Petrinovic et al., 2010). The Cumbres Dacite is formed by dacitic lavas rich in centimetric phenocrystals of sanidine, which cover the summits of Cerros Quevar and Gordo in the central sector of the QVC (Robl et al., 2009).\nOverall, the QVC recorded a magmatic evolution from acidic to intermediate-basic compositional terms. The sequence began with the basal rhyolites of Quebradas Quir\u00f3n and Incahuasi, continued with the main dacites of the central sector, and culminated with the andesites and basaltic andesites of the SW and N sectors. The final Cumbres Dacite departs from this compositional evolution.\n\n\n2.4.2\nHydrothermal alteration\nThe QVC includes a pervasive lithocap located on the southwestern flank of the stratovolcano, along the Quebradas Incahuasi, Toro Grande and Mamaturi, where the hydrothermal alteration has an areal extension of about 50\u00a0km2 and reaches a vertical thickness of 1.2\u00a0km (Robl et al., 2009; this work). Hydrothermal alteration affects the volcanic rocks of the Quevar Dacite, but it is not developed in the Azufre Andesite and in the Cumbres Dacite (Figs. 3 and 4\n). This alteration was apparently more intense in the volcaniclastic facies of breccia and tuff than in the coherent lavas. Following Cooke et al. (2014), it is possible to distinguish several mineralogical types of alteration in the Quebrada Incahuasi, which are briefly described below (see also Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021).\nThe dacites and andesites located near the summit of Cerro Fernando and to the S of the Vince deposit show a variable propylitic alteration. At the microscale, it is characterized by the partial or total pseudomorphic replacement of volcanic ferromagnesian minerals by secondary aggregates of chlorite, epidote and calcite, as well as plagioclase by calcite, epidote and zeolites. The volcanic groundmass has completely recrystallized to a very fine-grained aggregate composed of epidote, white mica, montmorillonite group minerals and zeolites. Between the zeolites, Robl et al. (2009) identify heulandite (stable at T\u00a0<\u00a0210\u00a0\u00b0C), clinoptilolite, laumontite and yugawaralite. This mineral assemblage is typical of the epidote subzone of a low temperature propylitic alteration (e.g. Cooke et al., 2014), which is probably genetically related to the depth intrusion of a hydrous porphyry stock. Spatially associated with the propylitic alteration there is a replacement of the primary ferromagnesian minerals by pyrite, accompanied by the pseudomorphosis of feldspars and the groundmass by albite, quartz and zeolites.\nThe phyllic alteration is associated with the fault and breccia zones located eastern Filo Quespejahuar and southern Cerro Fernando, as well as the vicinity of the Armon\u00eda deposit. At the microscale, it is characterized by the replacement of plagioclase and the volcanic matrix by an aggregate of very fine-grained phyllosilicates.\nThe argillic, advanced argillic and silicic alterations present a great extension in the Quebrada Incahuasi, defining a broadly stratabound domain of approximately 1\u00a0km-thick and more than 3\u00a0km of visible lateral extension. These hydrothermal alterations caused the progressive loss of the volcanic mineralogy and textures. The transformation and leaching of the rock gave rise to its progressive whitening, highlighting in the landscape of the Quebrada Incahuasi (Fig. 4a). At the microscale and with an increasing degree of argillic alteration, the mineral association of montmorillonite, halloysite and illite is replaced by alunite, kaolinite, quartz, gypsum and sulfur. Alunite is especially abundant on the Filo Quespejahuar. Advanced argillic alteration is frequently accompanied by intense silicification. Leaching of volcanic phenocrysts and replacement of the groundmass by aggregates of very fine-grained quartz and\/or amorphous silica results in vuggy-quartz textures. Both advanced argillic and silicic alterations overlap the propylitic alteration. Hypogene silicic, advanced argillic and argillic-altered rocks volumetrically define a lithocap in the sense of Cooke et al. (2014), which was formed by extensive water-rock interaction when acidic magmatic-hydrothermal fluids reacted with wallrock dacites during ascent towards the paleosurface (Sillitoe, 2010, 2015; Hedenquist and Taran, 2013). Therefore, it was probably formed above a shallow-crustal unexposed, hydrous intrusive complex.\nIn the Quebrada Incahuasi (Fig. 3), the lithocap is zoned and characterized by an outwards transition from a central silicic core composed of residual quartz (with massive and\/or vuggy textures), through advanced argillic alteration (typically quartz-alunite) to argillic (quartz-kaolinite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0illite) and propylitic (chlorite-calcite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0epidote) assemblages (Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021). The fumarole sulfur deposits located at the highest topographic levels of Cerro Azufre and southward Cerro Fernando constitute the places of superficial discharge of the magmatic volatiles, probably located directly above the main upflow zone.\nAt elevations above 4500\u00a0m above sea level, precipitation\/alteration products forming surficial insoluble minerals are widespread and related to a paleo-relief surface developed on top of Quevar Dacite. This supergenic alteration is characterized by the formation of iron oxides\/hydroxides, clay minerals, manganese oxides and silica, which stains the rock in red-orange colors (Fig. 5\ng). At the microscale, it is made up of jarosite, goethite, hematite and limonite, among other minerals (Fig. 5h). The Rumibola Andesite and Cumbres Dacite unconformably overlie this leached cap.\n\n\n2.4.3\nEpithermal mineralization\nIn the Quebrada Incahuasi, the QVC contains a polymetallic epithermal system of Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn (Sb, As, Bi), which has been exploited mainly in the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar mineral deposits (Figs. 3 and 4). These deposits have been exploited intermittently, having provided about 3,000 tons of ore, with an average grade of 8.06% Pb and 0.26% Ag. Mineralization is located (Robl, 2003; Robl et al., 2009): (1) in vein systems and breccia cement; and (2) disseminated in pockets and more irregular domains of hydrothermaly altered rocks. The first type of deposit is mainly located along a ca. 3\u00a0km long, ENE-trending band (Fig. 3).\n\nRobl et al. (2009) distinguish two main stages of mineralization. The first stage is made up of various mineral species of Ag in the Armonia deposit, which are members of the lillianite and andorite groups, as well as bournonite, galena and pyrite. The second stage consists mainly of galena and lead sulfosalts in barite gangue, among other mineral phases, which is present in all deposits. A third stage would be established in the minerals formed and metals remobilized during the supergenic alteration. Robl et al. (2009) indicate that mineralization is generally associated with vuggy-quartz, in the form of very fine-grained sulfides and sulfosalts, cementing the microbreccias of the host volcanic rock and filling the voids originated during the leaching of volcanic phenocrysts (Fig. 5e and f). The microtextural relationships between neotectonic structures and mineralization will be presented elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nMineralized veins and fault-slip data analysis\nStress or strain can be evaluated using inversion methods of brittle fault-slip data (Angelier, 1994). It involves collecting data of fault plane orientations, fault striae directions and sense of slip from kinematic indicators at the outcrop scale. Mesoscopic kinematic indicators used to infer the sense of slip on the fault-plane along the striae direction were the growth of fibrous crystals in steps, R and P-Riedel shears, grooves and crescent fractures, among others (e.g. Petit, 1987). In order to obtain from fault-slip data the principal stress axes (\u03c31\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c33) and the stress ratio R = (\u03c32-\u03c33\/\u03c31-\u03c33) that best fit the reduced stress tensor at a given site, several inversion methods have been proposed (see reviews by C\u00e9l\u00e9rier et al., 2012; Sperner and Zweigel, 2010; Twiss and Unruh, 1998). Using multiple methods, hence different algorithms, will allow us to increase accuracy in the results by reducing the effect of systematic errors.\nIn natural conditions, fault-slip data sets measured at one location can be polyphasic, that is, include several fault subpopulations consistent with different stress tensors. The separation of the fault subpopulations referring to each tensor was performed prior to the inversion method for stress, calculating the pressure (P or compression axis) and tension (T or tensional axis) axes for each fault-slip data. Appearance of several clusters of P or T axes in stereographic projection were interpreted as indicative of the existence of fault-slip data related to different paleostress tensors, allowing their separation in fault subpopulations. Fault cross-cutting relationships, the overprinting of several striations in the same fault plane and the absolute age of the faulted rocks have also been used as criteria to date faults and thus paleostress tensors and tectonic phases.\nVisualization of the fault-slip data in stereographic projection, statistical processing and inversion of the fault-slip data was performed with the TectonicsFP v1.7.9 software of Reiter and Acs (2000) and Ortner et al. (2002). Fault-slip data analysis and principal stress axes calculation were first performed with the kinematic right-dihedra method (Angelier, 1994), which shows the distribution of the percentage of compression or extension dihedra in stereographic projection. Inversion of fault-slip data was accomplished after with two inverse independent methods (Ortner et al., 2002, and references herein): direct inversion and numeric dynamic analysis. On the other hand, mineralized epithermal veins generally present a late brittle reactivation of their planes, which does not allow to obtain an unambiguous state of stress during their formation by means of kinematic analysis. In these conditions, clustering of vein data using a mixed Bingham distribution was used for paleostress analysis (Yamaji et al., 2010; Yamaji and Sato, 2011). Bingham distributions, or the orientation distributions with orthorhombic symmetry, has been applied to infer the state of stress during formation of magmatic dykes, mineral veins and fractures (Yamaji and Sato, 2011). In these works, the symmetry axes of the Bringham distribution of planar anisotropies (\u03b51, \u03b52 and \u03b53 eigenvectors) correspond to the principal axes of the stress tensor (\u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33, respectively). Yamaji et al. (2010) further argue that the stress ratio R = (\u03c32\u2212\u03c33)\/(\u03c31\u2212\u03c33) of the stress field related to the formation of an epithermal vein set could be approximated by the ratio of the concentration parameters \u03ba2\/\u03ba1 of the Bringham distribution. Further explanation of the methodology of acquisition and analysis of mineralized veins and fault-slip data followed in this work is included in Appendix A of the electronic supplementary material.\n\n\n3.2\n\n40Ar\/39Ar geochronology analytical techniques\nRock samples for 40Ar\/39Ar geochronology were crushed and sieved to obtain fragments ranging in the size range from 0.1 to 0.5\u00a0mm. The samples were rinsed in dilute nitric acid, washed in deionized water, rinsed and then air-dried at room temperature. Whole rock chips were stacked in an irradiation capsule with similar-aged samples and neutron flux monitors (Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine, 28.02\u00a0Ma; Renne et al., 1998). The samples were irradiated at the McMaster Nuclear Reactor in Hamilton, Ontario, for 56 MWH, with a neutron flux of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 neutrons\/cm2. Analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a054) of 18 neutron flux monitor positions produced errors of <0.5% in the J value. The samples were step-heated at incrementally higher powers in the defocused beam of a 10\u00a0W CO2 laser (New Wave Research MIR10) until fused, at the Noble Gas Laboratory of the Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research, University of British Columbia. The gas evolved from each step was analyzed by a VG5400 mass spectrometer equipped with an ion-counting electron multiplier. All measurements were corrected for total system blank, mass spectrometer sensitivity, mass discrimination, radioactive decay during and subsequent to irradiation, as well as interfering Ar from atmospheric contamination and the irradiation of Ca, Cl and K. Isotope production ratios were (40Ar\/39Ar)K\u00a0=\u00a00.0302, (37Ar\/39Ar)Ca\u00a0=\u00a01416.4306, (36Ar\/39Ar)Ca\u00a0=\u00a00.3952, Ca\/K\u00a0=\u00a01.83(37ArCa\/39ArK). The plateau and correlation ages were calculated using Isoplot 3.09 software (Ludwig, 2003). Errors are quoted at the 2\u03c3 (95% confidence) level and are propagated from all sources except mass spectrometer sensitivity and age of the flux monitor. The geologic time scale is from Cohen et al. (2013, updated in 2021).\n\n\n\n4\nStructure of the Quevar Volcanic Complex in the Quebrada Incahuasi\nThe structure of the QVC has been inferred from: (1) tectonic deformation affecting late Miocene volcanic rocks, hydrothermally altered equivalents and mineralization; (2) orientation of faults and folds at all scales; and (3) paleostress tensors and tectonic regimes deduced from the inversion of faults-slip data.\n\n4.1\nField structural relationships\nOur structural map compiled at the 1:10,000 scale covered the whole Quebrada Incahuasi and complements the work of Robl (2003). This fieldwork area was selected for its accessibility and for containing the main mineralized structures of the QVC. The geology of the Quebrada Incahuasi consists mainly of (Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021): (1) scarce remnants of a lower extrusive dome of rhyolites; (2) an intermediate group of faulted and folded dacites and subordinately andesites; (3) an upper unaltered sequence of slightly faulted and tilted andesites and dacites, that unconformably overlie an erosive surface developed on the intermediate volcanic rocks; and (4) an unconformable cover of Quaternary gravitational, alluvial and fluvial deposits. The spatial distribution of these groups of rocks is included in the lithological-structural map and cross-sections of Figs. 3 and 4. The lower rhyolitic dome and the variably altered intermediate dacites, as well as the hosting epithermal mineralization, are deformed by strike-slip and extensional faults. The upper sequence of andesites and dacites are deformed by normal or normal-oblique faults and were not affected by hydrothermal alteration.\nField mapping, microscopic observations and XRD whole-rock analysis have allowed to distinguish several lithological types in the intermediate Quevar Dacite, depending on the degree of the replacement of the volcanic mineralogy and textures by hydrothermal mineral assemblages in the lithocap (Figs. 3 and 4; Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021). In general, the coherent facies show slight alteration and are made up of porphyritic dacites and minor andesites characterized by a massive or flow foliated internal structure. They exhibit porphyritic and aphanitic textures produced by cooling and solidification of magma. These characteristics indicate that these are silicic subaerial lavas and extrusive domes, with associate autobreccias linked to the advance of the flows. The unaltered pyroclastic facies are little or no-vesicular and consist mainly of block and ash flow deposits of dacite and subordinately rhyodacite and andesite composition (Fig. 5a), resulting from explosive volcanic eruptions. These fragmentary facies are composed of poorly vesicular silicic juvenile clasts, crystals and sparse to abundant lithic fragments.\nIn the altered rocks and with the progressive increase of the hydrothermal replacement, lithological types are distinguished with a slight or non-existent argillic alteration, a moderate argillic alteration and incipient feldspar destruction (Fig. 5b), an intense argillic alteration with complete texture destruction (Fig. 5c), an advanced argillic alteration and incipient silicification, and a pronounced silicification or residual vuggy-quartz (Fig. 5d). Transit between lithologic types may be gradual or relatively abrupt in the field, defining a spatial zonation in the hydrothermal alteration.\nThe upper unaltered sequence of andesites and dacites are part of the Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite, respectively. The Azufre Andesite is made up of subaerial lavas of andesite and minor dacite composition, porphyritic to aphanitic texture, little or no-vesicular, and with a massive to flow-banded internal structure. The Cumbres Dacite is composed of dacites and subordinately riodacites, in coherent facies of subaerial lavas, with a well-developed porphyritic texture and banded structure.\n\n\n4.2\nMacro and mesoscale structures\nThe spatial distribution of macrostructures deforming the Quevar Dacite, its volcanic basement, the lithocap and the hosting epithermal deposits is included in the structural map of Fig. 6\n. Structural analyses at all scales allow grouping structures into three main sets: (1) sub-vertical dykes and veins with epithermal mineralization; (2) strike-slip faults; and (3) normal faults. The appearance of these structures on the outcrop scale is shown in Fig. 7\n and their stereographic projection in Fig. 8\n. Field examples of crosscutting relations between different mesostructures are displayed in Fig. 9\n.\n\n4.2.1\nDykes and veins with epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization\nDykes and veins with epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn (Sb, As, Bi) mineralization occur along an ENE-trending band, which includes the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits (Fig. 6). They present a dominant ENE-trend and a sub-vertical dip both towards the NW and SE (Fig. 8). However, the vein orientation can locally change to a NE\/NNE and NW trend, as in the Vince deposit. At the outcrop scale, the individual veins have a millimeter to centimeter (<5\u00a0cm) thickness (Fig. 7a and b). Mineralized veins are grouped in swarms of subparallel structures whose thickness varies between 5\u00a0cm and 1\u00a0m, hosted in the Quevar Dacite with an argillic, advanced argillic and silicic hydrothermal alteration. In the Armon\u00eda deposit, mineralized vein swarms exhibit roughly subparallel silicification development.\n\n\n4.2.2\nStrike-slip faults\nThese brittle structures are organized into three sets of different orientation: (1) ENE to E-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults; (2) NW to NNW-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults; and (3) NNE to N-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults. All of them have a high-dip angle (>65\u00b0) and contain striations with a low-pitch angle (<25\u00b0; Fig. 8), Strike-slip faults have been observed at all scales affecting the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar mineral deposits (Figs. 6 and 9). The ENE to E-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults are cartographically dominant and are often disposed with an en-\u00e9chelon map pattern, laterally connected by NW to NNW-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults. The NNE to N-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults are less developed at all scales. The local development of ENE to E-trending anticlinal and synclinal folds with large wavelength and sub-horizontal axes (Fig. 6) is spatially associated to this strike-slip deformation.\nIn the Quespejahuar and Armon\u00eda deposits, the strike-slip faults deform the dacites variably affected by the argillic and advanced argillic alterations, the subparallel silicified bands, and the mineralized veins (Fig. 7c, d, e). In some sectors of the advanced argillic alteration, the development of alunite aggregates elongated along the mesoscopic strike-slip faults is frequent, as well as filling subparallel tension gashes. Some fault planes exhibit fills and impregnations of oxides and oxy-hydroxides of Fe, which have resulted from the oxidation of the sulfide mineralization and the mobilization\/precipitation of dissolved material within the fracture network (Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.2.3\nNormal faults\nThe ENE to E and ESE-trending normal and oblique-normal faults exhibit high-dip angles towards the N and S (Fig. 8). These extensional structures have been observed at all scales, mainly on the southern slope of the Filo Incahuasi, along the Incahuasi valley, and in the sectors of the Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits. They produce important vertical block displacements and juxtapose rocks of different type and degree of hydrothermal alteration (Fig. 7h). On the southern slope of the Filo Incahuasi a normal fault system produced a vertical throw of about 75\u2013100\u00a0m on the lava flows of the Azufre Andesite (Fig. 7f and g). In the Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits, the ENE to E-trending normal faults contain striations characterized by high-pitch angles (>60\u00b0), which indicate a direct normal movement or with a small strike-slip component (Fig. 8). In these sectors, normal faults deform argillic alteration, silicification and the hosted mineralized veins. These extensional structures coexist with the ENE to E-trending strike-slip faults at both map and outcrop scales, so that both types of structures can be kinematically related or result from successive deformation phases that occur over time. However, the reactivation of the strike-slip surfaces as normal faults, evidenced by high-pitch angle striations overprinting low-pitch angle striations on the same ENE to E-trending planes (Fig. 9), as well as the kinematical compatibility (see fault-slip data inversion section), imply the existence of two deformation events.\n\n\n\n4.3\nStress field solutions obtained by inversion of mineralized veins and fault-slip data\nStress inversion of the mineralized vein sets and fault-slip data yield 11 stress tensors, whose geological characteristics and site locations in the Quebrada Incahuasi are reported in Appendix B, C and D. This compilation of stress tensors only includes data derived from veins and faults developed in volcanic rocks of late Miocene age. Appendix E includes the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress, stress regime, kinematic type of faults and the immersion method used in each site, which are generally consistent with each other.\n\n4.3.1\nStress tensors obtained from the bingham distribution of mineralized dykes and veins\n\nFig. 8 shows the stereographic projection of the symmetry axes (\u03b51, \u03b52 and \u03b53) of the Bingham distribution of mineralized dykes and veins in 6 locations of the Quebrada de Incahuasi, relative to the maximum, intermediate and minimum plane pole concentration. The characteristics of the corresponding stress tensors are summarized in Appendix C. Stress tensors present a dominant ENE to NE-trend for the maximum horizontal stress (\u03c31) and a NNW to NW-trend for the minimum horizontal stress (\u03c33), indicating that the Quebrada de Incahuasi was subjected to a strike-slip stress regime during the formation of the mineralized dykes and veins. The obtained sub-vertical orientation of the \u03c32 stress axis is consistent with the frequent arrangement of mineralized veins in conjugate en-\u00e9chelon systems in plan view, where the sub-horizontal \u03c31 bisects the acute angle formed by the intersection of conjugate vein systems (Fig. 9). Sub-vertical mineralized structures were initially opened normal to the orientation of the sub-horizontal \u03c33 stress axis, which presents a relatively homogeneous NNW to NW-trend in all studied sites.\n\n\n4.3.2\nStress tensors obtained by inversion of fault-slip data\nIn the Quebrada Incahuasi, reduced stress tensors were calculated from fault-slip data measured in 5 sites located near the main strike-slip fault zones and around the mineral deposits. The stereographic projections of the obtained principal stress axes from several inversion methods at each geographic site are shown in Fig. 8. Paleostress analysis was limited to the availability of rock outcrops with a sufficient number of fault-slip data, but the obtained results have allowed us to reconstruct the evolution of the stress regime in the late Miocene.\nIn the 18JE02 site of the Quespejahuar deposit, the stereographic projection of the fault planes and the low-pitch angle (<25\u00b0) of associated striae establishes that these are strike-slip faults (Appendix B). Aplication of the right-dihedra method to these strike-slip faults set gives a stress tensor whose principal stress axes \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33 have an orientation (and relative value) of N232\u00b0E\/07 (0.49), N101\u00b0E\/79 (0.32) and N323\u00b0E\/08 (0.20), respectively. These results establish a NE-directed sub-horizontal shortening in a strike-slip regime (\u03c32 is sub-vertical, R\u00a0=\u00a00.09), which is reflected in a sub-vertical intersection in the compression and extension dihedral diagram. Inversion of the fault-slip data using the direct inversion method yields a similar stress tensor. The trend of the principal strain axes obtained by numeric dynamic analysis is also compatible, with \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bb3 oriented N233\u00b0E\/08, N066\u00b0E\/82 and N323\u00b0E\/02 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.5), respectively.\n\nFig. 8 shows the results of the inversion method in the 18JE05 site located in the Armonia deposit. Stereographic projection of fault-slip data establishes the existence of sub-vertical faults characterized by striations with low and high-pitch angles, which indicate strike-slip and normal movement, respectively. Stereographic projection of P and T kinematic axes of all fault-slip data shows a great dispersion (Appendix B). However, the distribution of these axes allows separating two fault subsets compatible with strike-slip (sub-horizontal P axes) and extensional (sub-vertical P axes) stress regimes. Application of the right-dihedra method to the strike-slip fault set gives a stress tensor whose main stress axes \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33 are N053\u00b0E\/00 (0.48), N144\u00b0E\/66 (0.31) and N322\u00b0E\/24 (0.24), respectively. Similarly, the values for principal stress axes obtained for the normal fault subset are N066\u00b0E\/88 (0.46), N261\u00b0E\/02 (0.33) and N171\u00b0E\/01 (0.21), respectively. Dihedral diagrams for each calculated stress tensor are characteristics of strike-slip and extensional faults. The application of the direct inversion method to the same fault sets gave rise to strike-slip and extensional tensors of very similar orientation. (Fig. 8). Using the numeric dynamic analysis for the strike-slip faults subpopulation, yields a compatible strain tensor of axes (\u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bb3) trending N060\u00b0E\/10, N194\u00b0E\/75 and N328\u00b0E\/10 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.55), respectively. Analogously, the principal strain axes obtained for the normal faults subpopulation are N045\u00b0E\/88, N262\u00b0E\/01 and N172\u00b0E\/01 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.47). In summary, inversion of the fault-slip data establishes the existence of two different stress tensors in the 18JE05 site of late Miocene age. As field data indicate that high-pitch angle striations indicative of an extensional movement are superimposed to low-pitch angle striations formed during a strike-slip movement (Fig. 9), the extensional stress tensor is more recent in time.\nThe result of the inversion of fault-slip data in site 18JE13 located near the power keg of the Quespejahuar deposit is included in Fig. 8. The stereographic projection of the measured sub-vertical faults characterized by striations with high-pitch angle establishes that these are normal faults. Their kinematic axes indicates that they were formed during a single deformation phase (Appendix B). Application of the right-dihedra method establishes an orientation for \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33 of N069\u00b0E\/59 (0.46), N273\u00b0E\/29 (0.30) and N177\u00b0E\/11 (0.24), respectively. These results define a sub-vertical compression under an extensional regime in the NNW trend (\u03c31 is sub-vertical, R\u00a0=\u00a00.08), which is reflected in a sub-horizontal intersection in the compression and extension dihedral diagram (Fig. 8). Although independent of each other, the results obtained with the direct inversion and numeric dynamic analysis methods are compatible with right-dihedra method. For example, the trend of the main strain axes obtained by numeric dynamic analysis is N075\u00b0E\/75, N267\u00b0E\/15 and N177\u00b0E\/03 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.32).\n\nFig. 8 shows how the inversion of fault-slip data in site 18JE16 located in the Arena sector of the Incahuasi river upper valley also yielded two stress tensors: a strike-slip regime under ENE-directed shortening and an extensional regime of NNW trend. Stereographic projection of fault-slip data establishes the existence of sub-vertical faults characterized by striations with low and high-pitch angles, which indicate strike-slip and normal displacements. Their kinematic axes shows a large dispersion without a single well-defined maximum (Appendix B). Application of the right-dihedra method to the strike-slip fault set gives a tensor of axes \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33 with trends N059\u00b0E\/08 (0.48), N308\u00b0E\/67 (0.31) and N152\u00b0E\/21 (0.24), respectively. Similarly, the set of normal faults is compatible with a tensor of axes N091\u00b0E\/71 (0.41), N241\u00b0E\/16 (0.33) and N334\u00b0E\/09 (0.26). The right dihedral diagrams for each fault set are characteristics of strike-slip and extensional faults (Fig. 8). Application of the direct inversion method leads to similar results, which establishes strike-slip and extensional deformation regimes for each fault set. The principal strain axes (\u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bb3) obtained from numeric dynamic analysis for the strike-slip faults are N068\u00b0E\/20, N278\u00b0E\/67 and N162\u00b0E\/11 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.59). Analogously, the strain tensor obtained from the normal faults is N087\u00b0E\/80, N256\u00b0E\/09 and N346\u00b0E\/02 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.47). Therefore, the tensors obtained from the different inversion methods are compatible with each other.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n40Ar\u201339Ar geochronology\nThe main objective of geochronology was to obtain the ages of the Quevar Dacite, the hydrothermal alteration and the Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn epithermal mineralization, as well as indirectly the age of coeval tectonic deformation. To fulfill this objective, dacites affected by a different degree of hydrothermal alteration were sampled and separated volcanic and hydrothermal mineral fractions with different closure temperatures (in the sense of Hodges, 2003) were analyzed. A summary of sample location, 40Ar-39Ar incremental heating experiments and the 40Ar-39Ar spectrum and isochron diagrams of mineral separates are reported in Appendix F of the electronic supplementary material.\nQV04 sample is a dacite collected in the lower stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite at the Armon\u00eda deposit. It corresponds to pyroclastic facies, with ash to block-size clasts, affected by a moderate argillic alteration and incipient destruction of the feldspar. In the vicinity, there are hot springs with a clear structural control in relation to ENE-trending faults. The obtained biotite plateau age is 4.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.33, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.81, 2\u03c3, including a J-error of 0.4%) for four steps (6\u20139) of the incremental heating and 84.0% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10\n). The inverse isochron age on six points is 4.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.25), with an initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025\u00a0Ma (Appendix F). The individual ages for the plateau have been calculated with the initial Ar ratio obtained from the isochron intersection. Although the collective interpretation of the geochronological results is addressed in a later section, given the late Miocene age of the Quevar Dacite (Robl et al., 2009), these results suggest the existence of a Zanclean age (early Pliocene) isotopic resetting thermal event, which reached temperatures above the biotite closure temperature (T\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C) or, alternatively, the opening of the system during the hydrothermal alteration process.\nA separate of the volcanic groundmass from QV04 sample has provided a plateau age of 9.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.85, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.55) for eight steps and 77.4% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age on eight points is 9.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.92), with an initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 293\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma close to the atmospheric value (295.5). Given the quick cooling of the groundmass in volcanic conditions, the plateau age is an estimate of the extrusion age of the QV04 dacite in the Tortonian (late Miocene). A separate of plagioclase from sample QV04 has also provided a plateau age of 8.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.65, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.74) for nine steps and 90.8% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age on nine points is 9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.94), with an initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 284\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma. The rapid cooling of the felsic magma and the closing temperature of the plagioclase (T\u00a0\u223c\u00a0225\u00a0\u00b0C) suggest that this plateau age corresponds to the dacite extrusion in the Tortonian, which is similar, within the error, to those obtained for the groundmass.\nQV10 sample is a porphyritic dacite lava, slightly affected by hydrothermal argillic alteration and devoid of mineralization. The sample was collected about 400\u00a0m SE of Quespejahuar deposit and represents the lower stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite. The obtained biotite plateau age is 7.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.32, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.90) for six steps and 85.4% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age obtained for the four points with the lowest temperature is 11.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6\u00a0Ma, for an 40Ar\/36Ar initial ratio of 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a018), which has a large error and is far from the atmospheric value. The inverse isochron age obtained for the six points of the highest temperature is 8.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0Ma, for an initial ratio 40Ar\/36Ar\u00a0=\u00a0281\u00a0\u00b1\u00a070 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.35), which is close to the atmospheric. Therefore, this age calculated from the high-T steps of the plateau is the best age estimation for biotite crystallization in the Tortonian. The inverse isochron on five first steps suggests Ar mobility through the mineral lattice causing a loss of 40Ar at low temperatures.\nA separate of the volcanic groundmass from QV10 sample has provided a plateau age of 9.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.88, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.52) for eight steps and 81.8% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The older ages obtained in the higher temperature increments suggest incorporation of older material in the groundmass or an Ar excess. The inverse isochron age obtained for eight points is 9.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27\u00a0Ma, for an initial ratio 40Ar\/36Ar\u00a0=\u00a0309.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.8). Given the quick cooling of the groundmass under volcanic conditions, the plateau age probably corresponds to the extrusion age of the dacite in the Tortonian.\nQV16B sample consists of a dacitic lava with small sulphide-mineralized veins and argillic alteration, collected at high stratigraphically levels of the Quevar Dacite. However, feldspar and biotite phenocrysts are apparently fresh. The obtained biotite plateau age is 6.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.22, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.99) for eleven steps and 91.9% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age obtained for ten points is 6.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49\u00a0Ma, for a40Ar\/36Ar initial ratio of 301\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.23), which is close to the atmospheric value. Therefore, the plateau and inverse isochron ages are similar. These results suggest the existence of a Messinian age (highest Miocene) thermal event with isotopic resetting, which reached temperatures higher than \u223c400\u00a0\u00b0C or, more likely, the opening of the system during the hydrothermal alteration process.\nA separate of the groundmass with hydrothermal minerals from sample QV16B has provided a plateau age of 7.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.70, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.10) for nine steps and 92.5% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age on ten points is 7.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.5) for an initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept of 303.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8\u00a0Ma. Therefore, both ages coincide within the error. This sample has also provided a younger plagioclase plateau age of 1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.65\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.55, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.77), for seven steps and 87.7% of the 39Ar released. Due to the probable opening of the isotopic system during the alteration processes of the dacite, the plateau age obtained for the volcanic groundmass of 7.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 (Tortonian-Messinian boundary) can be an estimate for the age of the hydrothermal alteration.\nQV17 sample is a dacitic lava related to autoclastic facies of monomictic breccia, affected by a minor argillic alteration. It is located in the upper stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite, under the Azufre Andesite. A separate of the gray groundmass with hydrothermal minerals in the magnetic range of 0.2\u20130.5 A has provided a plateau age of 6.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.62, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.71) for seven steps and 88.3% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age for these seven points is 6.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.74), for a low initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 226\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034. Although both ages coincide within the error, the best estimate of age is 6.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0Ma, since the individual ages in the plateau were calculated with the initial Ar ratio obtained from the intersection of the inverse isochron.\nIn the same sample, a separate of the pink groundmass with hydrothermal phases in the magnetic range 0.5\u20131.0 A yielded a plateau age of 6.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.09, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.36) for five steps and 72.8% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The corresponding age obtained by the inverse isochron method for eight points and a low initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.9) is 6.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0Ma. This age is the best estimation for the sample, since the ages obtained in the plateau increments were calculated with the initial Ar relation obtained from the intersection of the inverse isochron. The four highest temperature increments provide an age by the inverse isochron method of 8.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.4), which suggests the existence of an older component in the volcanic groundmass and\/or mobility of Ar through the rock.\nAdditionally, the QV17 sample yielded a plateau age for plagioclase of 7.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.56\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.71, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.73), for 100% of the 39Ar released in twelve steps of the incremental heating (Fig. 10). The similar age obtained by the inverse isochron method in the five high-T increments is 7.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma, for an initial ratio 40Ar\/36Ar\u00a0=\u00a0296\u00a0\u00b1\u00a062 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.23) close to the atmospheric value. Taken together, the Messinian ages obtained in the QV17 sample suggest a thermal resetting event, which reached temperatures higher than 150\u00a0\u00b0C and\/or an opening of the system during the hydrothermal alteration. Note that there are components in the groundmass of Tortonian age, similar to the extrusion ages obtained in other samples of the Quevar Dacite.\nQV19 sample consist of a dacitic lava, moderately replaced by silicic and advanced argillic alteration. It contains mineralization dispersed in the rocks and filling fracture planes. The sample was collected at the highest stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite. Biotite phenocrysts have provided a plateau age of 9.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.12, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.99) for nine steps and 90.5% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age obtained for nine points is 9.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0Ma, for a40Ar\/36Ar initial ratio of 294\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.12), which is close to the atmospheric value. Therefore, both ages coincide within the error and account for the time of biotite crystallization by cooling during the magma extrusion in the Tortonian (late Miocene).\nA separate of the groundmass with hydrothermal minerals in the magnetic range of 0.5\u20131.0 A yielded a plateau age of 6.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.23, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.98) for eight steps and 89.6% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The age in the same groundmass separate obtained by the inverse isochron method for 7 points and an 40Ar\/36Ar initial ratio of 293\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.10) is 6.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0Ma. This age is similar to those obtained in the pink groundmass of the QV17 sample. Analogously to this sample, the four highest temperature increments of the plateau provide an older age by the inverse isochron method of 8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma, which also suggests the existence of an older component in the groundmass or the Ar mobility through the rock.\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nRelationships between volcanic stratigraphy, hydrothermal alteration and epithermal mineralization\nThe field data in the Quebrada Incahuasi indicate that, after the rhyolitic dome emplacement of the Rhyolites and Perlites unit, the dacites and andesites of the Quevar Dacite were erupted. The accumulation of lava flows and pyroclastic deposits gave rise to the building of a large strato-volcano, during the late Miocene evolutionary stage of the QVC in the Central Andean Volcanic Zone. The volcanic mineralogy, textures and structures of the Quevar Dacite were later modified by the superposition of an hydrothermal alteration. In the Quebrada Incahuasi, the map distribution of this hydrothermal alteration defines the steeply-dipping structural root of the lithocap, which follows an ENE-trending band that includes the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar mineral deposits (Fig. 3). Therefore, the upflow of the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid from the deeper-seated source to the lithocap environment was structurally controlled by the ENE-trending fault zones. However, the lithocap is composed of a large sub-horizontal lenticular domain in excess of 1\u00a0km-thick, between the topographic heights of 4550\u00a0m (Vince deposit) and 5700\u00a0m (Cerro Azufre), extending laterally up to 10\u00a0km in the N and NE trends, along the Quebrada Toro Grande and Mamaturi (Marquetti et al., 2017). Therefore, the lateral outflow of the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid occurred when the ascending fluid reached its neutral buoyancy level and encountered a permeable stratigraphic aquifer, as the poorly consolidated volcaniclastic breccias and tuffs of the Quevar Dacite.\nThe lithocap hosts the high-sulfidation epithermal mineralization (Robl et al., 2009), which appears forming (1) dykes, veins and\/or breccia cement and (2) more disseminated stratabound replacements. Mineralization in veins and breccia cements is mainly related to ENE-trending fault planes and sub-vertical fracture systems, located in the structural roots of the lithocap, as in the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits. Therefore, this style of mineralization had a clear structural control. Reactivation of veins as faults during episodic deformation can result in several stages of tectonic brecciation, mineralization disruption and new infill of the created open spaces. Mineralization by replacement is generally located at a higher topographic elevation in the QVC. It is volumetrically much more extensive and typically hosted as replacements in the residual quartz domains. The extent of this type of mineralization was probably controlled by the lateral flow of mineralizing fluids (Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021).\nThe coherent facies of the Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite unconformably overlap the Quevar Dacite, or hydrothermally altered rock equivalents. The field data imply: (a) an interruption of felsic volcanism; (b) the cessation of the hydrothermal alteration system and the high sulfidation mineralization; (c) the beginning of a stage of erosion of the volcanic edifice with the formation of a paleorelief; (d) the exposure of deep levels of the volcanic stratigraphy and lithocap that are brought close to the surface; and (e) a new reactivation of silicic magmatism in the QVC with the eruption of subaerial lavas. The erosion and formation of an erosive surface controlled the late gossan-type alteration, which has been preserved in the topographically higher sectors of the Quevar Dacite.\n\n\n6.2\nLate miocene structures in the Quebrada Incahuasi of the QVC\nIn the study area, the most prominent structure is the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro lineament, which both includes NW-trending segmented left-lateral strike-slip faults and broad bands of distributed shear deformation (Fig. 1). The lateral limits of the COT lineament are constituted by the Quevar and Chorrillos left-lateral strike-slip fault zones (Fig. 2; Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013). Both large-scale fault zones, together with other related lower-order structures, define a tectonic left-lateral strike-slip stepover at regional-scale (Seggiaro et al., 2016), which controlled the evolution of the Aguas Calientes caldera and the Quevar Volcanic Complex in the late Miocene, as well as the location of the mineralized veins in the Quevar and La Poma districts (Seggiaro et al., 2021). Thus, the main WNW-trending Quevar fault zone defines the southwestern boundary of the stepover. Internally, the stepover is divided by related subsidiary faults into smaller tectonic blocks.\nIn the Quebrada de Incahuasi, the geometric and kinematic analysis of faults carried out in this work indicates that the E to ENE-directed regional sub-horizontal shortening could have (re)activated the Quevar fault zone as a left-lateral strike-slip fault (Fig. 6). Angular relations between the main Quevar fault zone and ENE to E-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults, suggest that these subsidiary faults correspond to synthetic R-type structures (sensu\nSchreurs, 2003) laterally connected to the Quevar master structure. Therefore, the Quevar fault zone accommodated only a portion of the far stress field, whereas the remained was transferred as a near-field stress to ENE to E-trending R-type faults and left-lateral strike-slip duplexes (sensu\nWoodcock and Fisher, 1986) at several scales. These R-type faults juxtapose zones with different degrees of alteration in the lithocap, as well as control the tectonic landscape of elongate valleys in the Quebrada Incahuasi. Although development of NNW to N-trending, right-lateral strike-slip faults is rather limited in the Quebrada Incahuasi, the general trend of these structures with respect to the orientation of the external stress field suggests that these correspond to antithetical R\u2032-type structures. Therefore, R and R\u2032-type structures were able to accommodate a part of the far stress field through the internal disruption of the stepover into small tectonic blocks and, probably, a minor contribution through rotation and\/or translation of such blocks.\nOn the other hand, the dykes and veins with epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization have a sub-vertical dip and a dominant ENE to NE trend, although in the Vince and Armonia deposits vein plane orientation ranges to a NNE strike (Fig. 8). Comparison between the orientation of the far stress field and the general trend of the mineralized structures suggests that they are favorably oriented T-type structures. This is consistent with the existence of open space fill textures in mineralized veins and associated fracture systems, opened by a NNW-trending orthogonal extension. In turn, the contact between the mineralized veins and the hosting altered dacite frequently exhibits a reactivation as a brittle fault (Fig. 9), in which the kinematic indicators in these planes establish both strike-slip and normal movements.\nIn summary, the epithermal mineralization in sub-vertical veins had a clear structural control, resulting from a general left-lateral strike-slip regimen, which gave rise to the opening of the ENE to NE-trending dykes and veins that channeled the mineralizing fluids. Furthermore, the different strike-slip fault sets distinguished in the Quebrada Incahuasi were also formed by a similar WNW-trending left-lateral strike-slip regime. Therefore, epithermal mineralization, associated hydrothermal alteration and strike-slip faulting are part of a progressive deformation, consequence of the regional stress field imposed by the E to ENE-directed convergence. On a larger scale, this progressive deformation was related to the formation of a left-lateral strike-slip stepover, produced between the Quevar and Chorrillos fault zones of the COT lineament (Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013; Seggiaro et al., 2016). The fault zones developed in Quebrada Incahuasi are thus integrated into the rhomboidally shaped stepover, or zone of slip transfer, between these overstepping and subparallel strike-slip faults.\nThe Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite are not hydrothermally altered and apparently only deformed by normal faults. Therefore, the eruption of these subaerial lavas marks cessation of hydrothermal activity and strike-slip motion along the COT, as well as the transition to an extensional or transtensive regional stress regime. This transition is documented by analyzing fault-slip data in the next section.\n\n\n6.3\nLate miocene tectonic stress regimes obtained from fault-slip data\nIn the Quebrada de Incahuasi, stress field solutions calculated from inversion of measured fault-slip data establish late Miocene strike-slip and extensional stress regimes, which are summarized in Fig. 9. Strike-slip stress regimes (\u03c32 disposed sub-vertical) obtained from strike-slip faults are characterized by ENE to NE-trending maximum horizontal stress (\u03c3H\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c31) and stress ratio values of 0.37\u00a0<\u00a0R\u00a0<\u00a00.48 (Appendix C), that establish a pure strike-slip type of deformation. The ENE to NE-trending sub-horizontal shortening was oblique to the WNW-ESE trend of the Quevar and Chorrillos fault zones of the COT lineament (Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013; Seggiaro et al., 2016). This obliquity resulted in the partition of the deformation inside the rhomboidally shaped stepover located between them, producing a left-lateral slip in the WNW and ENE\/E faults (P and R-types) and a right-lateral slip in the NNW\/N faults (R\u2032-type).\nThe stress tensors obtained from the Bingham distribution of mineralized dykes and veins are characterized by the ENE to NE-trending of the maximum horizontal stress (\u03c31) and values of the stress ratio between 0.02\u00a0<\u00a0R\u00a0<\u00a00.16 (a value equal to 0.47; Fig. 9). Therefore, the prevailing stress regime during the formation of the epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralizations was strike-slip\/compressional (R\u00a0<\u00a00.25; \u03c32\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c33). The \u03c31 trend is subparallel to that of the mineralized dykes and veins, so their opening as T-type structures could have taken place during this tectonic regime. The internal tectonic brecciation of the veins, with successive stages of cementation and mineralization of the resulting matrix, and the reactivation of the vein-wallrock contact as a strike-slip fault indicate that the strike-slip was coeval and subsequent to mineralization. Therefore, the obtained stress regimes support the interpretation that formation of mineralized veins, their subsequent reactivation as strike-slip faults and the formation of the different kinematic fault-sets are different stages of a progressive deformation under a similar strike-slip regime. The change from a strike-slip\/compression to a pure strike-slip regime, recorded by the R-value increase, is interpreted as related to a permutation (sensu\nPeacock et al., 2017b) of \u03c33 into \u03c32 vertical stress (Fig. 9).\nExtensional stress regimes (\u03c31 disposed sub-vertical) obtained from normal and oblique-normal faults are characterized by NNW to N-trending minimum horizontal stress (\u03c33) and stress ratio values of 0.27\u00a0<\u00a0R\u00a0<\u00a00.47 (Appendix C), that establish a pure extension type of deformation (Fig. 9). Field crosscutting relationship and timing of fault movement indicate in several locations (as Armonia and Quespejahuar deposits) an initial left-lateral strike-slip movement along ENE to E-trending faults caused by the strike-slip regime, followed by a normal movement in the same fault surfaces triggered by the extensional regime (Fig. 9). The strike-slip regime prevails until the eruption of the Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite, which are only deformed by normal faults. Therefore, in Quebrada Incahuasi, the extensional regime replaces that of strike-slip, and it does so prior to the eruption of these units. The change from a pure strike-slip to a pure extensional was related to a permutation of the vertical stress from \u03c32 to \u03c31 (Fig. 9).\n\n\n6.4\nAge of the Quevar Dacite and hydrothermal alteration in the Quebrada Incauhasi\n\nFig. 11\n summarizes the 40Ar-39Ar geochronological results obtained for Quevar Dacite samples in the Quebrada Incahuasi of the QVC. The oldest obtained ages were in the biotite phenocrysts of the QV19 sample, which belongs to the highest stratigraphical levels of the unit that were apparently not affected by the hydrothermal alteration. This age is interpreted as that of biotite crystallization by cooling during the magma eruption in the Tortonian (late Miocene). The plateau and inverse isochron ages obtained for the rest of the biotites in rocks affected by hydrothermal argillic alteration (QV4 and QV10) are younger, although they were collected at lower levels of the volcanic sequence. These results suggest the existence of a Messinian age (latest Miocene) thermal event with isotopic resetting, which reached temperatures above the biotite closure temperature (T\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C) or, more likely, the opening of the system during hydrothermal alteration processes.\nHowever, the plagioclase phenocrysts from the QV4 sample have provided relatively older ages, similar within error to those obtained in the biotite phenocrysts from the QV19 sample. Therefore, this age also records the plagioclase crystallization by cooling during the magma eruption in the Tortonian. The rest of the plagioclase have provided younger plateau and inverse isochron ages. These ages were obtained in samples collected at the highest stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite, which contain sulphide-mineralized veins and are variably affected by hydrothermal argillic alteration (QV16B and QV17). Therefore, these Messinian ages are related to a thermal resetting event, which reached T\u00a0>\u00a0150\u00a0\u00b0C (plagioclase closure temperature; Hodges, 2003) and\/or to a system opening during the hydrothermal alteration.\nSeparates from the volcanic groundmass have also provided relatively old plateau ages (QV4 and QV10), similar within error or slightly older than those obtained in part of the biotite and plagioclase phenocrysts. Although these samples are slightly affected by hydrothermal argillic alteration, they have preserved the primary isotopic values and the resulting age is interpreted as corresponding to the rapid cooling of the dacitic magma during the eruption. In favor of this interpretation is the inverse isochron age obtained in the four highest temperature increments for the pink groundmass in the QV17 sample, which suggests the existence of an older component in the volcanic groundmass. The rest of the plateau and inverse isochron ages obtained in the groundmass fall in the 7.46 to 6.32\u00a0Ma interval (latest Miocene). These relatively young ages were obtained in samples with veins and disseminated sulphide mineralization, as well as variably replaced by silicic and advanced argillic alteration (QV16B, QV17 and QV19). As in the case of the younger age group obtained in the biotite and plagioclase phenocrysts, these ages record the opening of the isotopic system during the hydrothermal alteration and epithermal mineralization processes in the Quevar Dacite.\n\n\n6.5\nLate miocene evolution of the QVC\nIn this section, a structural evolutive model is proposed that integrates all data obtained in the Quebrada de Incahuasi of the Quevar Volcanic Complex. This model allows establishing the relationships between dacitic volcanism, hydrothermal alteration, epithermal mineralizations and coeval deformation. The model comprises three main stages schematically shown in Fig. 12\n.\nThe first stage included the eruption of the Quevar Dacite in the Tortonian (9.9\u20138.7\u00a0Ma) over the Aguas Calientes caldera ignimbrites (10.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma), within the evolutionary context of the Quevar Volcanic Complex. The construction of the volcanic complex took place through the accumulation of lavas and pyroclastic deposits, together with the syn-volcanic intrusion of subaerial felsic domes and\/or crypto domes (Fig. 12a). The coherent facies consisted of dacitic and subordinately andesitic and riodacitic lavas, as well as autoclastic rim facies, and the pyroclastic facies included proximal monomictic block and ash flows deposits, and distal scoria and ash flow deposits. The regional WNW to NW alignment of the contemporary Rinc\u00f3n, Tul-Tul, Del Medio, Quevar and Azufrero volcanoes indicates a control of the COT lineament in the volcanic activity during this stage.\nThe second stage included the implantation of an extensive hydrothermal alteration system in the Quevar Dacite and the related formation of the epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization in the Messinian (7.7\u20136.3\u00a0Ma). The geometric and kinematic characteristics of the mineralized dykes and veins, the mineralized breccia zones and the related hydrothermal alteration (silicic, advanced argillic, argillic), indicate that the alteration and mineralization processes took place during a regional strike-slip deformation. This deformation was related to ENE to E-directed sub-horizontal shortening induced by Cenozoic regional convergence and the (re)activation of the Quevar fault system of the COT, which formed a large-scale left-lateral strike-slip stepover between WNW-trending regional faults (Fig. 12b). In the Quebrada Incahuasi, the internal deformation in the stepover produced mainly synthetic ENE to E-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults (R) and NNW to N-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults (R\u2032), as well as the opening of ENE-trending planes (T) that host most of the mineralized dykes and veins. The main mineral deposits are included in an ENE-directed band that probably channeled the ascent of the magmatic-hydrothermal fluids.\nThe third stage included the erosion of the volcanic edifice and the lithocap, as well as the mobilization of chemical elements in relation to a supergenic alteration (gossan). The hydrothermal system ceased its activity prior to the eruption of the unaltered Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite. In Quebrada Incahuasi, the kinematics of the brittle reactivation of mineralized veins and ENE-trending strike-slip faults indicate the subsequent implantation of a NNW-directed extensional regime. In this sector, ENE to E and WNW-trending extensional faults control the morphology and the incision of the drainage network.\nThe tectonic stress evolution of the QVC included a first regime of strike-slip\/compression to a pure strike-slip, which was followed by a regime of pure extension. The successive changes in the stress regime were related to a permutation of \u03c33 into \u03c32 and after \u03c32 into \u03c31 vertical stress. The timing for the orogen-normal strike-slip stress regime ranges between \u223c10 and 6.5\u00a0Ma and the orogen-parallel extensional stress regime started in the latest Miocene (<6.5\u00a0Ma). This evolution of the regional stress regime during the Cenozoic is similar to that previously described in various sectors of the Antiplano-Puna plateau, Western Cordillera and along the Andes of southern and central Peru (S\u00e9brier et al., 1988; Marrett et al., 1994; Cladouhos et al., 1994; Marrett and Strecker, 2000; Elger et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2013; Daxberger and Riller, 2015; Giambiagi et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nIn the Quebrada Incahuasi of the QVC, the epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization in sub-vertical dykes and veins of the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits, associated hydrothermal alteration and strike-slip faulting are part of a progressive deformation, consequence of the regional stress field imposed by the E to ENE-directed convergence. This progressive deformation was related to the formation of a left-lateral strike-slip stepover between the Quevar and Chorrillos fault zones of the COT lineament.\nThere are two age groups in the Quevar Dacite: (1) ages between 9.9 and 8.7\u00a0Ma (Tortonian) for syn-volcanic processes such as crystallization of phenocrysts and rapid cooling of the groundmass; and (2) ages between 7.7 and 6.3\u00a0Ma (Messinian) for post-volcanic processes that imply mobility of Ar through the rock produced by the opening of the system and\/or thermal events with isotopic resetting at temperatures higher than the closing of each mineral. Therefore, the first group dates the time interval of Quevar Dacite eruption and the second group the hydrothermal alteration and epithermal mineralization.\nThe evolution of the stress regime recorded in the QVC during the Cenozoic has been interpreted regionally in terms of two main geodynamic phases: (1) an orogenic constructional phase, older than late Miocene, and (2) a gravitational collapse phase, active from late Miocene to present. The discussion of possible causes for the stress regime change in the northern Puna plateau exceeds the objectives of this work, focused on a sector of the QVC. However, this work documents how the transition from a strike-slip to an extensional regime led to an important hydrothermal alteration and epithermal mineralization in Quebrada de Incahuasi, as well as other coeval mineralizations described in the northern Puna, which illustrate why structural geology is critical to finding, evaluating and mining ore deposits.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nJavier Escuder Viruete: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing- Original draft preparation, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Eduardo A.

The development of crustal faults also provides insights into plate boundary interaction and crustal deformation processes past and present. Although faults and associated fracture zones have been studied for several decades, the absolute timing of fault slip and fracture formation has in general remained a poorly constrained parameter. Indirect dating methods include using the timing of uplift using thermochronology (e.g. Brichau et al., 2006), exposure dating of geomorphological features (e.g. Brown et al., 2002), and dating of structures offset by displacement (e.g. Searle et al., 2010). Direct dating of ductile deformation (shear) zones is potentially more straightforward as it can utilise the growth\/overgrowth or isotopic resetting of moderate to high temperature minerals (>400\u00a0\u00b0C) such as mica, zircon, monazite and titanite, to infer when shearing was active (e.g. Mottram et al., 2015; Viola et al., 2016). Beyond the timescales of surface exposure dating, the direct dating of faults in the brittle regime requires the presence of mineralization formed during or shortly after slip, either in gouge, veins or along fault surfaces (e.g. Eyal et al., 1992; van der Pluijm et al., 2001; Ault et al., 2015; Dichiarante et al., 2016). One of the most widespread syn-tectonic upper crustal mineral precipitates is calcite, commonly occurring along shear fractures or faults as slickenfibres and in fault-related opening-mode fractures as veins. If calcite can be reliably dated, and can be shown to have grown at the time of fault-slip and\/or regional deformation events, then it offers a method that has wide applicability across many upper crustal deformation zones.\nHere, we present a summary of recent progress in calcite geochronology applied to upper crustal faults that has seen a rapid adoption of this method, and show that this is opening new avenues of investigation in structural geology. We focus our attention here on fault-related structures, rather than opening-mode fractures (or veins) in general. Although not specifically covering geochronology, the review of Laubach et al. (2019) provides an excellent synopsis of opening-mode fracture cements and fills which should also be used as a reference source for calcite cement dating studies in general. With regard to fold-related structures, Lacombe et al. (2021) also provide detail on several associated mineralization structure types than can potentially be dated using calcite fills. Here, we discuss the importance of linking the dating of mineralization to fault movement and fracture opening, which represents a critical, but currently somewhat underdeveloped keystone of this geochronological application.\n\n\n2\nThe calcite chronometer\nCalcite (CaCO3), a trigonal mineral, and the most stable form of calcium carbonate, is commonly found precipitated within opening mode fractures and along fault planes in a wide variety of host lithologies and tectonic settings. These are commonly termed \u2018veins\u2019, but as Gale et al. (2014) point out, the term is used somewhat inconsistently. Calcite incorporates various metals at the trace level which can act as potential radioisotopic chronometers (Jahn and Cuvellier, 1994; Rasbury et al., 2009). Most commonly utilised is uranium, which can be dated through decay to its final daughter product, lead (U-Pb geochronology) or via decay to its intermediate daughter products 234U and 230Th (U-Th geochronology). U-Th geochronology is applicable over timeframes ranging from several years to around 600,000 ka (Edwards et al., 1987; Williams et al., 2017), although it requires very high analytical precision at the older end of this age range. U-Pb geochronology is theoretically applicable across the entire geological timescale, but is most commonly used beyond the realm of U-Th dating at > 1\u00a0Ma, and within the Phanerozoic eon (Roberts et al., 2020). The Sm-Nd isotopic system has been utilised in several past studies, mostly for hydrothermal carbonates in economic mineral deposits (e.g. Peng et al., 2003; Uysal et al., 2007; Barker et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2020). Other possible systems in carbonate minerals include Rb-Sr and Lu-Hf (Maas et al., 2021); we will return to these in a later section.\nEach radioisotopic system has benefits and limitations. With the exception of U-Pb, all other methods are traditionally achieved through micro-drilling aliquots of the sample, followed by chemical dissolution and chromatography to separate parent and daughter isotopes. This is than followed by analysis with either Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) or multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). The spatial resolution of the micro-drilling sampling can be as fine as <100\u00a0\u03bcm; however, depending on the technique used for measurement and concentration of the isotopes, the volume needed can be considerable (>5\u00a0mm3). Given that hydrothermal calcite is commonly zoned at a very fine scale (e.g. Roberts et al., 2020a), these methods can potentially average out several generations of calcite growth. More recently, the in-situ technique, laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) has been developed for U-Pb in calcite (Li et al., 2014; Ring and Gerdes, 2016; Roberts et al., 2017). Although LA-ICP-MS can also be applied to U-Th dating (Eggins et al., 2005), the method has large uncertainties and requires relatively high U contents compared to that of U-Pb. Use of the LA-ICP-MS technique means that ablation spots on the order of 50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm can be accurately placed within single growth phases and combined to calculate a single date. The benefits and applications of LA-ICP-MS to U-Pb dating of carbonate phases have been extensively reviewed in recent publications (e.g. Woodhead and Petrus, 2019; Roberts et al., 2020a; Kylander-Clark et al., 2020; Guillong et al., 2020; Elisha et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nCalcite as a syn-kinematic mineral associated with faults\nCalcite precipitates within fault zones along individual fault and fracture planes, forming mineral fills and cements that can be discrete or continuous at the outcrop scale. The types and origin of fault-related calcite fills have been reviewed extensively in the literature, e.g. Bons et al. (2012), Gale et al. (2014), Ukar and Laubach (2016) and Laubach et al. (2019) for recent summaries, along with Ramsay et al. (1983), Passchier and Trouw (2005) and Fossen (2016) for relevant book chapters. A key premise of using calcite fill to date the timing of fault slip, is that the dated mineral growth occurred either during fault slip or associated fracture opening, or, shortly thereafter. The notion of \u2018shortly thereafter\u2019 in this context, being that the duration between fault slip and calcite precipitation is smaller than the uncertainties of the dating method. This premise is complicated by the fact that: (1) faults will often be composed of many incremental phases of slip over hundreds to millions of years (e.g. Fossen 2016); and (2) some cements and fills may potentially result from localised chemical diffusional processes that are unrelated to faulting (e.g. Wiltschko and Morse, 2001). A second premise, is that the calcite fill, and in particular, the dated isotopic system, has remained undisturbed by later structural or fluid-related activity (Roberts et al., 2021).\n\nFig. 1\n highlights several common field occurrences of calcite precipitated as a consequence of fracture opening associated with faulting, i.e. the fractures either lie along a fault zone or occur in its associated damage zone. These include: slickenfibres grown along a fault plane with a clear lineation azimuth (Fig. 1a); calcite fills occurring in extensional jogs along a fault plane that exhibits a lineation (Fig. 1b) and multiple phases of deformation (Fig. 1c); calcite fill in a planar opening-mode fracture with no shear displacement (Fig. 1d); a swarm of sub-parallel contemporaneous calcite fills in opening-mode fractures (Fig. 1e); fracture-fill cements that have hosted open fluid-filled space leading to vuggy crystal growth (Fig. 1f); en-echelon fractures filled with calcite formed in association with a fault plane with a sense of shear (e.g. \u2018wing cracks\u2019 Fig. 1g); a cemented fault breccia (Fig. 1h); and an example of a cone-in-cone structure in calcite that is spatially associated with a fault plane (Fig. 1i).\nThe ability to link calcite mineralization to fault kinematics and associated fracturing processes is dependent on its origin and morphology; critically, this requires an understanding of the microstructure and textures of calcite fills, and can be assisted with the addition of geochemical and compositional information. Fig. 2\n schematically shows several types of fracture morphologies that can be cemented with calcite, whilst Fig. 3\n shows a range of natural examples viewed in thin section. The fill types and textures shown here are not exhaustive, but include some of those commonly used to directly infer the timing of fault slip and associated fracture opening relative to calcite precipitation (e.g. Roberts and Walker, 2016; Nuriel et al., 2012a, 2017, 2019; Oren et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020b; Miranda et al., 2020; Cruset et al., 2020). The purpose here is not to discriminate the only fill morphologies that can be used for geochronology, but to demonstrate that some examples of calcite mineralization can be more confidently linked to fault slip and associated fracturing than others. The cemented fractures shown in Fig. 2 have varying ability to be confidently linked to both the timing and kinematics of fault slip, and are drawn so that those on the left are easiest to unequivocally link to fault slip, whilst those on the right are less reliable. We also highlight common growth morphologies in calcite associated with these vein types. The terminology is purposely restricted to syntaxial and antitaxial to describe growth from the host rock towards the centre of the open void (syntaxial), and from a nucleation point within the void or vein towards the host rock (antitaxial); stretching fibres may exist with both of these opposing growth structures, and various other terms are in use in the literature (see Bons et al., 2012).\nSlickenfibres (Type I in Figs. 2 and 3a and b), although a sometimes-misplaced term (in terms of being used more broadly for calcite fault plane precipitation), are generally one of the most desirable forms of fault precipitates in that it provides clear kinematic information such as the azimuth of slip and in many cases the sense of shear. Slickenfibre calcite is a form of fracture-filling cement that fills an extensional jog space that is created in incremental steps (Bons et al., 2012); these are often on a scale that is not discernible to the naked eye, but are clearly seen in thin section. The example of Type II (Figs. 2 and 3a) is a larger pull-apart void space \u2013 or jog - that is mineralized during each phase of fault slip, i.e. precipitation is occurring synchronous with movement along the slip plane, as with slickenfibres. Opening mode tensile and hybrid (shear) veins (Type III) may form adjacent to major fault planes, or along minor fractures within fault damage zones. In such cases, it is important to establish the relative timing and kinematic links between fracture-sets and fault displacements where the relationships are evident. For example, it can be demonstrated that vein geometries and opening directions are consistent with the sense of displacement along nearby faults (e.g. Fig. 3a, b, d).\nThe aforementioned varieties all commonly exhibit crack-seal inclusion trails (e.g. Fig. 3b and c) left behind when a fracture opens due to displacement, and is then subsequently sealed by mineralization (Ramsay 1980). Petit et al. (1999) introduced the term \u2018crack-seal-slip\u2019, which is appropriate here, because there is commonly a cyclicity of fault slip along individual fault planes that leads to multiple phases of cracking and sealing. The crack-seal concept has been addressed in a number of studies investigating the role of stress release, dilation rate, fluid pressure and host rock strength, amongst other factors, on the formation of these cement types (Gaviglio, 1986; Lee and Wiltschko, 2000; Hilgers & Urai, 2005; Renard et al., 2005; and Holland & Urai, 2010). Crack-seal-slip cemented fractures along faults commonly display curved or inclined fibrous\/elongate mineral growth leading to the development of \u2018slickenfibre steps\u2019, which can be used to infer the sense of shear (e.g. Passchier and Trouw 2005). Because such mineral growth forms synchronously with displacement along shear fractures, these types are desirable for confidently linking dated mineral growth to fault slip.\nCalcite precipitate Types IV and V may also form from a process akin to \u2018cracking\u2019 and \u2018sealing\u2019, but are single phase, i.e. crack-seal but not crack-seal-slip. This does not mean that the associated host fault only had one phase of slip however, as subsequent slip may have been accommodated along adjacent or nearby fractures (i.e. crack-jump; Caputo and Hancock, 1998). Wall rock clasts in fault-related breccias and gouges (e.g. Type IV) may display overgrowths of calcite \u2013 so called strain shadows (see Passchier and Trouw 2005 for a review) \u2013 that are also arranged in an orientation consistent with the sense of fault slip (e.g. Fig. 3e).\nThe last precipitate (Type VI), is associated with the development of vuggy textures (e.g. Fig. 3f and g) and is potentially the least reliable in terms of providing robust timing constraints on fault slip. This is because the time gap between fault slip and precipitation into an open fracture void may be prolonged and could be much greater than the uncertainty of the dating method (Becker et al., 2010; Fall et al., 2012; Nuriel et al., 2012b). The vugs may remain open to the present day or become occluded by later calcite or other minerals. In many examples the calcite may display complex zoning, rind development, bridging structures (single bridge shown in Fig. 2) and even cockade textures consistent with repeated episodes of mineral precipitation and fluid flow (e.g. Fig. 3f; Laubach 2003, Frenzel and Woodcock 2014; Lander and Laubach, 2015). Dates of Type VI can provide minimum dates of fault slip (e.g. Roberts et al., 2020b), but they may also be used to determine the timing of other processes such as the timing of hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation (e.g. Fig. 3g; Drake et al., 2019; Holdsworth et al., 2019, 2020). Fault-related open fracture systems of this kind commonly contain sediment fills when formed close to the surface (e.g. Wright et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2011; Holdsworth et al., 2019) and dating of calcite precipitates in such cases may help to constrain the timing of both faulting and regional exhumation (Fig. 3h; Roberts et al., 2020b).\nIt is clear therefore that, despite the many complexities of natural fault-associated fracture fills, one can usually distinguish pre-, syn- and post-kinematic calcite and other mineralization using careful field observation and petrographic analysis. It is also notable that calcite mineralization shows a remarkably high survival rate following brittle deformation and cataclasis and that even post-kinematic fills are useful as they provide a minimum age for fracture opening. We suggest that fault hosted crack-seal-slip mineral fills are the most desirable for direct dating methods, and are the most reliably identifiable as syn-kinematic; we provide three reasons for our suggestion: (1) they record the direction of slip via mineral growth; (2) individual slip phases can be identified and dated; and (3) they preserve evidence of incremental growth that is unlikely to be preserved should phases of post-faulting fluid-flow and calcite reprecipitation occur. In addition, crack-seal-slip veins often host fluid inclusions which are useful for determining the composition and temperature of fluids at the time of faulting (e.g. Bons et al., 2012). This then allows linking of fracture fill temperatures to burial history curves (e.g. Becker et al., 2010; Fall et al., 2012, 2016; Laubach et al., 2016). In contrast, it is theoretically possible to overprint simple single-stage veins, breccia cements or crack-fill veins during later phases of fluid-flow, therefore these may be harder to unambiguously link to fault slip. Regarding crystal morphology, although blocky calcite may form as a response to precipitation during fracture opening (Ankit et al., 2013; Spru\u017eeniece et al., 2021), it is potentially harder to distinguish from later phases of fluid-flow and vein overprinting than fibrous or elongate growth types.\nThe above discussion focuses on fault plane precipitation; however, there are other means to use calcite to date fault activity. Notably, through the use of calcite precipitation that occurs due to enhanced fluid-flow during episodes of crustal deformation and hydrothermal mineralization in near surface settings. These most commonly occur in certain regions where geological conditions are ideal, i.e. areas with carbonate-rich lithologies, and hydrothermal fluid circulation. The various forms of these carbonate precipitates, most commonly referred to as travertines, have been used extensively in areas such as Turkey to understand neotectonics (e.g. Temiz et al., 2009, 2013). Brogi et al. (2021) recently reviewed this field of travitonics. Some of the dated structures can be classed as opening-mode (tensile) veins (e.g. Uysal et al., 2011), and can be linked to local fault displacements. Other features are linked to underlying faults through their morphology, such as fissure ridges. In the latter case, the kinematic link is somewhat limited since it is difficult to link calcite precipitation to exact episodes of fault displacement. Also noteworthy is that the same premise has been used for dating of neotectonic activity offshore within continental margins, where carbonate precipitating at methane seeps has been linked to fault reactivation driven by glacial tectonics (e.g. Himmler et al., 2019).\n\n\n4\nChronology within context\nFollowing the arguments outlined above, detailed structural characterisation of dated material is necessary to make the links between timing of crystal growth and fault slip\/fracture opening (Nuriel et al., 2012a, 2012b; Craddock et al., 2021). It is also necessary to elucidate whether primary crystal growth has been preserved, or obliterated by secondary reprecipitation and\/or alteration due to later fluid activity; a process that is entirely permissible, even for calcite slickenfibres (Roberts et al., 2021). There are a range of imaging techniques available for micro-structural and compositional characterisation of calcite. Collectively, Rasbury et al. (2021) and Roberts et al. (2020a) provide a synopsis of these with examples for different carbonate occurrences. Although advanced analytical techniques can provide intricate detail on elemental composition, such as U zonation using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping, some of the more readily available methods are the most useful for structural characterisation at the sample scale. Standard microscopy using transmitted and reflected light on well-polished surfaces can provide excellent detail of crystal morphology and the structural relations between growth phases (e.g. see Fig. 3), as well as detail on inclusions. Using microscopy on orientated samples, the twinning of calcite within and across a sample can be described; calcite twinning can be used an indicator of strain direction, intensity and temperature of deformation (e.g. Rowe and Rutter, 1990; Ferrill et al., 2004; Van der Pluijm et al., 1997). Cathodoluminescence (CL) provides some of the highest resolution levels of elemental zonation, and can be conducted using an SEM, or desktop microscope fitted with a CL detector and vacuum stage. CL remains one of the most common methods for carbonate petrography and microstructure. Elemental mapping using LA-ICP-MS provides compositional information at a useful scale for in-situ geochronology, and reveals detailed compositional variation of elements beyond the detection limits of SEM-based techniques. Information from elemental maps can also be easily correlated with isotopic age information, improving the ability to objectively interpret the resulting data (Drost et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2020a; Simpson et al., 2021b). Electron back-scatter detection (EBSD) is a less common technique currently for calcite, but can be used to assist with characterisation of calcite growth and deformation structures (Elisha et al., 2021).\nThe scale of in-situ analyses (typically 50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm spots), means that precise location of sample analyses can be achieved with respect to structural and compositional domains. The scale of complexity within calcite fills should not be underestimated however. To demonstrate this, Fig. 4\n shows an example of a complex calcite vein with structural domains narrower than 100\u00a0\u03bcm. The sample comes from a bedding-parallel fracture fill hosted in the Jurassic Whitby Mudstone Formation at Staithes in N England. Minor truncation of bedding laminations is seen in the field images, but the vein extends for over 400\u00a0m broadly parallel to the bedding. The CL image shows that at least three different gross structures can be discerned, with syntaxial growth zoning at the upper level, and repeated bands of bladed and fibrous calcite. The latter are inclined, indicating the direction of oblique opening and therefore a component of shear displacement across the fracture. A stylolite indicates dissolution due to vertical\/sub-vertical shortening. This example demonstrates that precise placement of ablation spots, or micro-drilled domains, is required to sample individual structural domains and potentially date different stages in the filling and associated fault movement history.\n\n\n5\nFaulting and calcite precipitation timescales\nAn important concern in the application of calcite geochronology to fault timescales is the duration of time between fault slip (and associated fracture opening) and calcite precipitation. The rates of calcite precipitation and of fracture sealing are also an important consideration in understanding rock strength and permeability in the sub-surface; e.g. because sealed mineral fills can be stronger than the host rock (Caputo and Hancock, 1998). To date, Williams et al. (2019) is the only study which has been carried out with the sole intention of providing accurate constraints on calcite growth rates using absolute geochronology. U-Th dates from the centre and edge of several vein samples provided rates between ca. 0.05\u20130.8 mm\/ka. Several other previous studies exist where multiple dates across single fracture fills have been measured, which can be used to estimate growth rates. Based on continuous precipitation of a coseismic travertine sample 20\u00a0cm wide that yields a span of ages over 400 ka, a 0.5\u00a0mm\/year growth rate can be inferred (Uysal et al., 2007; Karabacak et al., 2019). Karaback et al. (2019) dated the centre and rim of several travertine-type deposits with U-Th, yielding growth rates between 0.1 and 0.11\u00a0mm\/yrs. Observations of calcite precipitation in modern environments reveal even shorter time-frames. For example, Tulloch (1982) observed growth of platy calcite crystals in a geothermal well of 0.1\u00a0mm\/day. Such platy (or bladed) crystals occur typically in natural geothermal fractures with high fluid temperatures (McNamara et al., 2016).\nEstimates of fracture fill sealing rates can be determined empirically, using the premise that where resolvable ages of fault recurrence can be demonstrated, the sealing rate is likely to be much faster than the measured recurrence rate. At the coarser end of the scale, Craddock et al. (2021) resolved several distinct phases of faulting within a single fracture fill sample from the Gishron Fault, part of the Dead Sea fault zone. Based on the ability to resolve different generations of faulting using multiple ages, it can be inferred that the sealing time of each crack-seal phase was less than the recurrence time of ca. 2 million years. The ages of this single fracture fill overlap those from across the region (Nuriel et al., 2017), indicating that detailed chronologies of single fills can record protracted regional deformation. At a finer scale, Williams et al. (2017) demonstrated a recurrence interval of the Loma Blanca fault using U-Th geochronology of 40\u201350 ka.\nGrowth rates of calcite fracture fills and veins have also been modelled both experimentally and numerically. Experimental models suggest that solute (i.e. Ca) saturation and volume of the fluid control the rate of precipitation, and that filling of natural fracture fills may take thousands to millions of years (e.g. Lee et al., 1996; Lee and Morse, 1999); however, these types of growth models may be overly simplistic compared to nature, and thus the rates may not be directly applicable (Hilgers and Urai, 2002). Numerical modelling of fracture-fill mechanisms have become more complex over time (e.g. Hilgers et al., 2001, 2004; Nollet et al., 2005; Ankit et al., 2015; Prajapati et al., 2018; Sp\u00e4th et al., 2021; Spru\u017eeniece et al., 2021), but the scaling of these experimental rates to natural examples is uncertain. It is clear from the previous studies utilising absolute chronology summarized above that rates of crystal growth and vein sealing probably have a high variability in relation to availability, composition and temperature of fluids (e.g. Williams et al., 2019), and this will vary, potentially by orders of magnitude, across individual fault strands, damage zones and fault systems. With regard to the application of directly dating faulting, the key issue is knowing what the rates are likely to be within \u2018normal\u2019 upper crustal fault systems. Importantly it seems that the precipitation and sealing rates observed in these empirical studies, indicate that fracture fill\/vein sealing generally occurs on much shorter timescales than those of the current dating methods. This validates the use of these methods for constraining fault slip chronologies.\n\n5.1\nCase studies \u2013 individual fault histories\nSeveral studies have used calcite geochronology to investigate the timescales of individual fault strands (Fig. 5\n). Craddock et al. (2021) document a single mineralized fill sample from a strand of the Gishron Fault that exhibits normal and sinistral strike-slip offsets within the Dead Sea region. They obtained nine reliable ages, which clustered into five periods of faulting spanning ca. 20 to 13\u00a0Ma, each of which is associated with a change in the recorded direction of strain across the fault as determined through calcite twinning analysis. Williams et al. (2017) presented twenty reliable U-Th dates from the Loma Blanca normal fault in the Rio Grande rift, spanning several individual fracture fill samples. Their dates range from ca. 575 to 150 ka and, as highlighted above, can be used to demonstrate a recurrence interval of some 40 to 50 ka. The Dead Sea Fault Zone has been dated in several studies using both U-Th and U-Pb. Nuriel et al. (2012a and 2012b) dated several samples from a single quarry, close to the Hula Western Border Fault, which exposes several sinistral strike-slip fault planes. One sample has U-Th dates ranging from 237 to 28 ka, with another ranging from 159 to 61 ka. Uysal et al. (2011) dated a 3\u00a0cm wide banded calcite opening-mode vein taken from a normal fault in a tectonically active area of SW Turkey. Twenty dates across this single vein range from 23.9 to 11.8 ka. These studies indicate prolonged activity across individual fault strands on the order of thousands of years to 10s of ka.\n\n\n5.2\nCase studies - regional fault histories\nAnalysing regional fault histories with U-Pb has become the most common use of absolute chronology to faulting timescales, and has been applied to a wide variety of geodynamic settings (Fig. 6\n). Roberts and Walker (2016) dated several conjugate normal, strike-slip and oblique-slip fault strands that dissect the Faroe Islands using calcite precipitates occurring as filled extensional jogs and implosion breccias. The structures themselves were previously linked into a multi-phase kinematic framework of deformation that occurred as the North Atlantic Ocean opened (Walker et al., 2012). The dates (45\u201311\u00a0Ma) are younger than the widely accepted age for the onset of rifting (ca. 55 Ma), demonstrating that deformation associated with this rifted continental margin was protracted and outlasted the propagation of the oceanic spreading centre.\nFar-field and intraplate deformation has been dated in several studies. Goodfellow et al. (2017) dated slickenfibres precipitated on brittle strike-slip fault planes exposed in SE Sweden. Although complex age systematics were obtained, the authors unpicked ages of movement of 65 and 55\u00a0Ma, which they loosely tied to the far-field effects of Alpine convergence to the south. Roberts et al. (2020b) dated calcite fills associated with the final phase of normal fault movements along the Flamborough Head fault zone in NE England in an area where previous structural work had proposed a complex kinematic evolution with multiple reactivation events due to Alpine and other inversion events (e.g. Starmer, 1995). A cluster of dates ca. 65-56\u00a0Ma from a normal fault breccia cement and adjacent opening-mode veins, indicate that the normal faulting and earlier deformation occurred in the late Cretaceous. This means that all of the Flamborough Head fault zone movements onshore were unlikely to be related to Alpine or Pyrenean inversion. The dated deformation and associated calcite mineralization does, however, overlap the North Atlantic hotspot uplift and regional tilting of Britain.\nAs far as collisional orogens go, the timing of deformation within the European Alps is receiving considerable attention using calcite geochronology. Sinistral transtensional deformation, accommodated by both normal and dip-slip movement along faults bounding the Alpenrhein Graben in the Central Alps, was dated using slickenfibre calcite at 25 to 22\u00a0Ma by Ring and Gerdes (2016). The authors interpret this deformation as forming due to E-W extension in the Oligocene related to localised tangential stretching induced by subduction and convergence geodynamics along the Alpine belt. The Jura mountains represent a foreland fold and thrust belt in the northwest of the Alpine orogen, that exhibits detachment faulting along evaporite layers (e.g. Sommaruga, 1999). Looser et al. (2021) dated thrust faults within the Jura that were active during the foreland propagation of this belt, with one thrust being active at ca. 15 to 9\u00a0Ma, and another as young as 4.5\u00a0Ma. The Penninic Frontal Thrust represents a boundary in which \u2018internal\u2019 high-grade metamorphic units were thrust over less metamorphosed \u2018external\u2019 units of the Alpine belt; this thrust zone was then reactivated as an extensional fault during the late stages of the orogen (e.g. Sue and Tricart, 2003). Bilau et al. (2020) date the onset of this extensional reactivation through calcite veining and cementation of cataclasite to at least ca. 3.5\u00a0Ma, with a separate phase of reactivation occurring at ca. 2.5\u00a0Ma.\nVarious strike-slip and transform fault systems have been dated, some with large sampling campaigns. The Big Creek Fault is a large (>150\u00a0km) strike-slip fault within the Canadian Cordillera. Mottram et al. (2020) dated calcite that yielded two ages of fault movement, at ca. 73 and 60-57\u00a0Ma. Notably, they also utilised K-Ar illite dating to compare with the calcite chronology, and both methods yielded overlapping age constraints for fault activity. The Dead Sea Fault Zone is an active transform plate boundary between the Arabian and Sinai tectonic plates. Nuriel et al. (2017) dated onset of strike-slip fault activity through calcite fault precipitates to ca. 21 Ma in the southern Elat region, and ca. 17 Ma in the northern Hermon region. Oren et al. (2020) expanded upon this study, providing strike-slip fault activity constraints of 18 to 10\u00a0Ma, peaking at 14\u00a0Ma, indicating that faulting likely propagated from south to north. The Sinai-Negev Shear Zone is an E-W trending strike-slip fault slip that interacts with the Dead Sea Fault Zone at its eastern boundary. Weinberger et al. (2020) demonstrated that faulting here was initiated as early as ca. 73 Ma, with the main phase beginning at 27 to 22\u00a0Ma, and activity continued until at least 10\u00a0Ma, as constrained by the youngest U-Pb calcite date obtained. The North Anatolian Fault Zone is another seismically active strike-slip dominated region within the eastern Eurasian margin. Nuriel et al. (2019) dated part of the fault zone that was active as an extensional normal fault at 42\u00a0Ma, and showed that reactivation as a dextral fault zone occurred at ca. 11 Ma. Calcite sampling and dating campaigns of this nature are throwing additional insight to the interaction of plate boundaries and the resultant duration of activity along individual fault strands.\n\n\n\n6\nLimitations\nThere are several important limitations to the application of absolute geochronology methods to fault timescales, some that are general, and some specific to the isotope system. A general limitation is the ability to confidently link measured calcite dates with specific fault activity, and to provide robust evidence that the dated material represents primary calcite growth, and not later thermal or fluid-related activity. As discussed above, alleviating this limitation requires a combination of geochemical, compositional and microstructural characterisation (e.g. Figs. 1\u20134).\nThe usefulness of a date depends in part upon its age precision. For U-Pb dating, the individual uncertainties are often large spanning several million years or more. However, applying the method to areas where the timing of faulting is inferred based on cross-cutting relations, and often limited to periods of time such as \u2018Alpine\u2019 or \u2018Laramide\u2019, means that any new absolute age constraints still represent significant advances in our knowledge of regional timings (e.g. Parrish et al., 2018; Holdsworth et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020b).\nIn order to improve the precision of the in situ U-Pb carbonate method, more homogeneous reference materials will be required (in terms of their measured age), as the commonly used reference material (WC1; Roberts et al., 2017) imparts a >2.5% limit with which we can interpret any one age. The recently characterised material ASH15D presents a suitable candidate with an age uncertainty of only 0.4% (Nuriel et al., 2021), although its low concentration of radiogenic lead make it really only suitable for multi-collector instrumentation.\nAn important limitation to all radioisotopic methods, is having measurable quantities of the parent and daughter isotopes. For U-Pb, low uranium is a common and unpredictable issue in particular for fracture-filling calcite, as is a high abundance of common lead, which can swamp any measurement of radiogenic lead (Roberts et al., 2020a). At present, there are no known ways to easily screen samples to pick those most suitable for U-Pb dating, as U and Pb incorporation are compounded by a multitude of factors during calcite precipitation (Rasbury et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2020). Widespread interest in this method hopefully means this will not always be the case. A further limitation of U-Pb dating, is the potential disequilibrium of intermediate daughter products, which can significantly impact the accuracy of very young (<5\u00a0Ma) samples (see Roberts et al., 2020a).\nFor the U-Th method, similar problems of low U and high Th compound the measurement and obtainable precision. For isochron methods, such as Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr and Lu-Hf, age precision will in part be limited by the spread in initial parent-daughter isotope compositions, with a low spread in parent isotope abundance across the measured sample region leading to a lower precision isochron. The literature data on incorporation of these elements into calcite is sparse, but over time it is hoped that selection of suitable materials for each of these isotopic systems will become feasible. As all of these techniques develop over the next few years, it is likely that \u2018best practise\u2019 and knowledge about the most efficient means of screening, documenting and analysing samples will also improve.\n\n\n7\nBeyond faulting\nFaults are one of the major manifestations of crustal deformation; folds are another, and the two are often intimately linked. As with faulting, the timing of folding can be dated using associated calcite mineralization, as certain fracture fill (or \u2018vein\u2019) occurrences can be kinematically linked to fold development. Lacombe et al. (2021) provide a recent review of this application and the types of structures that can be utilised. To date, a number of studies have used U-Pb dating of fold-related structures to establish the absolute timing of deformation within various orogenic settings. These include basin inversion resulting from far-field tectonic stress in southern England (Parrish et al., 2018); Laramide and Sevier foreland shortening in the western USA (Beaudoin et al., 2018); shortening and extension due to ophiolite obduction in Oman (Hansman et al., 2018); and nappe stacking in the Pyrenees (Cruset et al., 2020; Hoareau et al., 2021).\nOpening-mode calcite veins in the upper crust can also form due to changes in lithostatic and hydrostatic pressure during burial and exhumation, typically through \u2018overpressure\u2019 relating to trapped fluids in the subsurface. The timing of such vein formation can potentially give information about the burial history of a sedimentary basin and the potential timing and processes of hydrocarbon formation and migration (e.g. Cruset et al., 2021). Overpressure related veins are just one example of opening-mode fractures that are not fault-related. The reviews of Bons et al. (2012), Gale et al. (2014) and Laubach et al. (2019) cover the formation of fracture fills in the various different settings that lie beyond the realm of those directly related to faulting.\nThe dating of calcite related to faulting has to date been restricted to brittle deformation. However, carbonate-bearing rocks can also be found in ductile shear zones. Such rocks, typically occurring as calc-silicates or marbles, could potentially yield information about the timescales of ductile shearing. How conclusive the data acquired would be, requires knowledge about the mineral growth and isotopic resetting \u2013 topics that are currently underexplored. For example, do dissolution-precipitation creep processes, as found in many mylonites and other foliated fault rocks, lead to isotopic resetting of calcite? At what temperature, on geological plausible timescales of heating, does isotopic resetting occur within calcite? At present, the empirical and experimental data on U and Pb diffusion within calcite are sparse, with the experimentally derived estimate of Cherniak (1997) indicating that temperatures above >350\u00a0\u00b0C are needed to induce diffusion on relevant length scales. Meinhold et al. (2020) dated a calcite concretion exhibiting cone-in-cone texture that has been deformed. A younger date for a deformed region compared to the undeformed region, led the authors to speculate that the U-Pb had been reset during low-grade regional metamorphism. Calcite within deformed calc-silicate rocks formed under semi-brittle to ductile deformation has been dated from a detachment fault in Turkey (G\u00fcrer, pers comm. 2019; G\u00fcrer et al., 2019), implying that there is potential for the dating of ductile shear-zone activity using this method.\n\n\n8\nFuture directions\nThe future directions for using calcite geochronology fall under two areas. The first lies within the development and improvements to the analytical techniques themselves. At present, LA-ICP-MS U-Pb is being rapidly adopted by many groups as it is requires instrumentation that is commonly available in many institutions and research centres. Other isotope systems that require clean suites for chemical procedures are likely to remain less popular. A new generation of instrumentation, whereby collision cell technology is employed in ICP-MS instrumentation, both of the quadrupole and multi-collector types, is opening up new frontiers in other isotope systems. For example, Rb-Sr, a method that was popular in the late 20th century but declined in popularity in the last couple of decades, is undergoing a renaissance, as Rb-Sr dating is now in the reach of LA-ICP-MS instrumentation (e.g. Zack and Hogmalm, 2016; Li et al., 2020; Bevan et al., 2021; Subarkah et al., 2021). Tillberg et al. (2020, 2021) have demonstrated the application of Rb-Sr dating to cogenetic adularia and calcite formed in various fault and fracture-fill mineralization occurrences within the Fennoscandian Shield. Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf are both permissible methods that are achievable using LA-ICP-MS, but require significant ingrowth of the daughter isotopes to reach useful levels of precision; this means a combination of high concentrations of parent Sm and Lu, and samples that are old enough. How old depends on the instrumentation and concentration, but Simpson et al., (2021a, 2022) have used a quadrupole instrument to demonstrate the ability to date Proterozoic apatite, garnet and calcite using Lu-Hf in situ. Dating young samples (<500 ka) with the U-Th method is not a common method, and developments of laser ablation U-Th dating have been slow to progress. In general, the U contents of vein-related calcite seem too low for the current generation of instrumentation for in situ (laser ablation) measurement, meaning that the method is confined to a micro-drilling and sample dissolution approach (e.g. Uysal et al., 2011; Prouty et al., 2016).\nThe other direction lies in the application of the method to ever more detailed levels of fault and fracture-fill timescales and processes. For example, at the largest scale this may involve campaign-style dating of transform fault systems to learn the complete history of plate boundary evolution. At the finer scale, it can encompass a better understanding of fault recurrence intervals through detailed and precise chronologies of young and active fault systems, potentially impacting our knowledge and prediction of hazardous (seismically active) faults. The method also has significant application to several applied research areas. These include dating faulting in relation to hydrocarbon migration (e.g. Holdsworth et al., 2019) and mineral systems (e.g. Jin et al., 2021), particularly since many economic deposits host calcite as a cogenetic hydrothermal mineral. In general, the information we require about the terrestrial subsurface is changing, with geothermal energy, underground carbon and hydrogen storage, and building of offshore wind farms and onshore nuclear facilities, all being examples where greater knowledge of the timing of fault and fracture-controlled deformation, strength, fluid-flow and permeability of rock volumes are required. Furthermore, the ability to directly link dated calcite to the composition and temperature of the source fluid, through fluid inclusions, stable isotopes (carbon and oxygen), radiogenic isotopes (Sr) and clumped isotopes (\u039447), and the possibility of doing this within or across individual crystal domains (e.g. MacDonald et al., 2019; Drake et al., 2021), means that calcite provides a powerful repository of past fault and fracture-hosted fluid-flow and fluid-rock interaction.\n\n\n9\nSummary\nAs initiated through the pioneering work of Ramsay (1980) on crack-seal processes, calcite mineralization associated with faulting can provide robust constraints on the timing of fault slip and associated fracturing. A key requirement for geochronology, is that detailed field observations and petrographic information of the analysed domains need to be carried out in order to unambiguously link the calcite growth history to fault activity. Crack-seal-slip calcite mineralization typically gives the best opportunity to link dated calcite to specific episodes of fault slip recognized in the field. Various isotope systems (U-Th, U-Pb, Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf) make the technique potentially applicable to fault histories across a wide range of geological timescales. The spatial resolution of the laser ablation technique lends itself to dating of fine-scale, complex-zoned, fault-related calcite.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nNick Roberts: Conceptualization, Writing \u2013 Original Draft, Visualization.

Collecting structural data, as well as the graphical representation of the structures and their interpretation, using geological mapping techniques, remote sensing, etc., are the first steps to be taken when studying natural structures in the field, especially mesoscopic- and macroscopic-scale structures, the ones that concern us here. Similarly to the rest of scientific disciplines, these geological techniques have not been alien to technical advances in society, but have benefited from them and this has allowed a remarkable scientific improvement of Structural Geology over time. Advances have taken place on many fronts. Thus, in the early days of Structural Geology, for instance, only field data collected in situ were available, which were reflected in drawings made manually in a field notebook. The advances in the Earth visualization gave a great impulse to Structural Geology both in terms of representing structural data and to obtain additional data; thus, nowadays extremely accurate topographic maps, aerial photographs, orthophotographs, satellite images, digital elevation models (DEM), and Google Earth and Street View images are available. The instruments that structural geologists use to carry out fieldwork have also undergone an enormous change from analog compasses to compasses capable of storing data, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), mobile phones and tablets, and from conventional photographic cameras to digital cameras and laser scanners. It goes without saying that computers have been a huge leap for society. In the field of Structural Geology, they initially allowed graphical representations of structures using drawing software packages with the advantages that this entailed, but later, powerful hardware and specific software have been available for the representation and interpretation of structures, as well as for the management and processing of large amounts of structural data, such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS), numerical modelling software, etc. This continuous process of improvement over time has undergone significant leaps at certain times. Deciding which have been the most notable improvements is probably subjective and surely depends on the personal view of each one influenced by his research lines. As an example, we can mention an important step forward for Structural Geology in the sixties due to the quantification of parameters derived from the analysis of photogeological interpretations and geological sections across natural structures lead by the work of John G. Ramsay in 1967. From our point of view, the most important leap in the last decades has been the move from the 2D study of structures to have 3D data accompanied by digital support. Computer-assisted, three-dimensional techniques have become enormously popular in recent times.\nThe rise of these techniques has led to the creation of virtual outcrop models (VOM) all over the world (e.g., Xu et al., 2000). See for instance the open-access online repositories of VOMs called eRock (https:\/\/www.e-rock.co.uk) (Cawood and Bond, 2019) or Virtual 3D Geoscience (https:\/\/v3geo.com) (Buckley et al., 2021). Some regions of the planet have a large number of VOMs, while others are quite the opposite despite the growing expansion of these techniques. The north-northwest of the Iberian Peninsula corresponds to the latter case, although the creation of VOMs would be especially useful because it is a mountainous region with difficult access areas and where some outcrops are difficult to visualize because they are located in steep slopes (Fig. 1\n). The rainfall index recorded in the north-northwest of the Iberian Peninsula makes that many rock outcrops are covered by vegetation and soils, however, there are two sectors within this region where spectacular outcrops occur. The first of these areas is the coast, where high cliffs adjacent to the beaches occur because the submarine abrasion platform was raised in relatively recent times revealing spectacular outcrops (e.g., Flor, 1983; Mary, 1983). The second area is the Cantabrian Mountains (e.g., Alonso et al., 1996), that are roughly parallel to the coast and whose southern slope, adjacent to the central Spanish Plateau, exhibits an appropriate climate to preserve the outcrops. The tectonics suffered by this region gave rise to two main structural units (Fig. 1): the Cantabrian Zone, which is the foreland fold and thrust belt of the Variscan orogen of Palaeozoic age (Lotze, 1945; Julivert et al., 1972), and the Asturian Basin, a Permian-Mesozoic extensional basin inverted during the Alpine orogeny of Cenozoic age (e.g., Garc\u00eda-Ramos and Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol, 1995) that gave rise to the Cantabrian Mountains and the Pyrenees. Thus, this complex structural history makes the north-northwest portion of the Iberian Peninsula an exceptional natural laboratory made up of very different types of structures. We will show here an inventory of available VOMs of structures in this region (Fig. 1); they correspond to different examples of Variscan contractional structures and also to different types of Mesozoic extensional structures reactivated as reverse structures during the Alpine event. All the outcrops shown correspond to regions located on steep slopes prone to rock fall, inaccessible areas or regions only visible during low tide periods. Some of these models are shown and described here for the first time, while new descriptions are offered for others previously presented. Since these models were created employing different digital techniques, such as photogrammetry, VOMs, orthophotographs and stereoscopical pairs of photographs, together with conventional and digital mapping, we will explain the general guidelines used and the results obtained. We would like to make it clear that this work is not intended to be an exhaustive review of all the digital techniques, but rather to present the models available up to now, describe them and explain the various procedures employed to build them introducing a few technical innovations.\n\n\n2\nMethodology employed\n\n2.1\nDigital and \u201ctraditional\u201d fieldwork\nNowadays, there are two different ways to collect data from outcropping structures: digital techniques and traditional methods. From our point of view, digital fieldwork has got some advantages over traditional fieldwork, however, it has also got some disadvantages. The strong points are: a) faster data acquisition; b) easier positioning of the collected data (at least in areas with good GPS coverage); c) ability to carry multiple types of supports such as maps, orthophotographs, etc.; and d) seamless transfer of field data to software back in the laboratory to backup and update older versions of maps. The most remarkable drawbacks are: a) some electronic devices provide good orientation and location measurements while others do not, b) excessive light on sunny days makes the screen of many mobile phones or tablets difficult to read, c) the electronic devices must be adequately waterproof protected in the event of heavy rains and\/or fall into the water, d) the breakage of the mobile phone or tablet may cause the loss of the collected data, e) satellite coverage is poor in lush forests and in the lower part of steep slopes so that the location data provided by the mobile phones or tablets are not reliable, f) electronic devices must be periodically calibrated using an analog compass to ensure that the measurements are correct, and g) electronic devices are strongly conditioned by the duration of the batteries.\nIrrespective of the types, features and scales of the studied structures, we carried out traditional fieldwork to collect new data as input data for the virtual models presented below. Fieldwork was also helpful to refine and improve the accuracy of the elements mapped in the laboratory and to check the results obtained from the digital techniques described in the following sections.\nTo improve the data collection procedure, as well as the process of integrating field data with data obtained in the laboratory, we collected field data using mobile phones and tablets (e.g., Allmendinger et al., 2017; Novakova and Pavlis, 2017, 2019) running a field-oriented application such as FieldMove (https:\/\/www.petex.com\/products\/move-suite\/digital-field-mapping\/), which can be downloaded for free, and ArcPad (https:\/\/www.esri.com\/content\/dam\/esrisites\/sitecore-archive\/Files\/Pdfs\/library\/brochures\/pdfs\/arcpadbro.pdf). These devices were used in combination with a high precision GPS when we thought the location data provided by our mobile phones or tablets were not sufficiently accurate. FieldMove and ArcPad allowed us to store in the mobile phones and tablets all sorts of information such as geographical coordinates, as well as dips and strikes, of stratigraphic contacts, faults, fold elements, etc. The collected data were imported into different types of supports such as aerial photographs, Google Earth images, VOMs, etc., using general software such as GIS, and more specific software such as an academic license of Move (https:\/\/www.petex.com\/products\/move-suite\/), although other software with similar functionalities such as Andino 3D (https:\/\/www.andino3d.com.ar) may be used.\n\n\n2.2\nGoogle Earth\nTwo digital methods used to map large-scale structures are: the stereoscopic visualization of pairs of aerial and\/or satellite photographs and their photogeological interpretation using specific software (e.g., Berger et al., 1992; Dueholm et al., 1993), and remote geological mapping from orthophotographs draped over DEM's managed using GIS software (e.g., Banerjee and Mitra 2004; Dhont et al., 2005). These two methods provide excellent results but do not seem to be the most widely used methods today. Anyway, these methods can be used in a complementary way to the most popular method nowadays which is Google Earth (https:\/\/www.google.com\/earth\/) (e.g., Lisle, 2006; Blenkinsop, 2012; Tavani et al., 2014; Mart\u00edn et al., 2019; Wellmann et al., 2019). The main advantages of Google Earth with respect to the methods mentioned above are: a) Google Earth does not require the use of specific software for image visualization and\/or interpretation because it provides its own free software; b) Google Earth has images of the entire planet for free, and therefore, there is no need to search for aerial photographs, orthophotographs, satellite images or DEM's of the region to be studied, difficult and\/or expensive to get in some places; c) there is no need to worry about the scale of the photographs, orthophotographs, satellite images or DEM's as Google Earth allows zooming in and out the images without quality loss unless detailed images of small outcrops are needed; and d) Google Earth allows sharing the information easily. Thus, this set of reasons led us to use Google Earth.\nThe interpretation of geological structures using Google Earth was carried out employing elements implemented in this software such as linear features (e.g., intersection of lithological contacts with the topographic surface, fold and fault traces, lineaments), polygons (e.g., regions where a particular rock unit crops out, fault-damage zones) and points (e.g., dip\/strike data, position of geological sketches and photographs) (Fig. 2\nb). All these elements were exported as kml files and loaded in a GIS software to create geological maps. One drawback derived from the geological interpretations carried out using Google Earth was that they lack altitude information, which was not a problem for generating maps, but limited its use, for instance, to calculate dips and strikes of bedding, faults, etc. This problem was overcome using auxiliary tools such as the free, online applications GPS Visualizer (https:\/\/www.gpsvisualizer.com) and KML Altitude Filler (https:\/\/www.nearby.org.uk\/elevation-kml.php) that, amongst other aspects, allowed calculating altitudes for kml files exported from Google Earth. Another solution we carried out was building a VOM using images and points of known coordinates extracted from Google Earth (e.g., Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). The procedure of constructing and interpreting a VOM derived from Google Earth images is described below.\nThe use of Google Earth is an excellent technique, however, we needed better resolutions, better points of view and more powerful zoom in\/out factors than the ones provided by Google Earth to study mesoscopic geological structures developed in inaccessible areas. Due to these reasons, we used the additional digital techniques described below.\n\n\n2.3\nVOMs\nNowadays, 3D photorealistic VOMs are probably the most commonly used approaches to analyse outcrops from the geological point of view (e.g., Xu et al., 2000, 2001; Buckley et al., 2008; Hodgetts, 2013). The acquisition of the required data can be made by employing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)\/terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) (e.g., Pringle et al., 2004; Bellian et al., 2005; Trinks et al., 2005; McCaffrey et al., 2010) or, alternatively, using photogrammetry (e.g., Bemis et al., 2014; Svennevig et al., 2015; Corradetti et al., 2017; S\u00f8rensen and Dueholm, 2018; S\u00f8rensen and Guarnieri, 2018; Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). We used the latter technique to create our VOMs because it is cheaper. Thus, the first method requires sophisticated devices, whereas the second can be carried out with commonly available devices such as photographic cameras and computers amongst others. Below we describe the practices we carried out for collecting the necessary data, as well as building and interpreting the VOMs.\n\n2.3.1\nPhotogrammetry data collection\nTo generate our VOMs we used the structure from motion (Sfm) photogrammetry (Carrivick et al., 2016 and references therein), which is a relatively quick and unexpensive technique, and one of the most widely used. In the case of large-scale structures, we saved in our computer different Google Earth images to cover the area of interest (Fig. 2b). On the contrary, in the case of smaller-scale structures, we took several photographs using photographic cameras mounted on tripods for ground-based studies (Figs. 3a, 4b, 5b, 6a, 7c and 8\nb\n\n\n\n) and\/or attached to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, drones) (Fig. 9\na). UAVs were used when the outcrop met certain particularities such as: a) relatively large area to cover, as flying was faster than walking and, in some cases, recording a video at high frames per second (fps) rates and extracting selected frames was good enough for building a VOM (Li et al., 2018); b) outcrops whose geometry could only be properly captured from the air, such as vertical or steeply inclined cliffs and slopes whose height did not allow correct coverage photographing from ground level, or studies that required a top-down view of the terrain because the plunge of the structures was oblique to the topographic surface; and\/or c) areas with environmental hazards, such as falling of rocks, slippery floor, etc., where getting close to the outcrop was not safe. Ground-based studies were used when: a) the outcrop to be simulated was relatively small; b) minor structures such as small veins, joints, cracks, etc. needed to be captured and handheld cameras yielded better pictures of these minor structures in terms of sharpness, resolution and contrast than cameras mounted on UAV's; c) the outcrop had relatively low relief, it was accessible and hiking was easy and safe, and therefore, it was easier to get close enough to the outcrop walking than piloting an UAV; and\/or d) the outcrop was located in an area where flying was prohibited or fly permits were hard to get, such as restricted flying zones, or especially difficult because of climatological and\/or topographical conditions.\nThe first and most important step was to cover the whole area of interest with enough images. The main issues we took into account when taking images from Google Earth or photographing the outcrop in the field using UAVs or tripods were: a) overlapping between pictures and b) minimizing shadowed areas. As a rule of thumb, the more overlapping the better accuracy, but also the longer computing time. Consequently, a compromise was reached between these two factors (Torres-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2017). To ensure an appropriate coverage, we took photographs of the outcrops along \u201cscanlines\u201d varying the distance and orientation of the scanlines with respect to the outcrop. Another successful practice was to take several pictures facing different directions from each shooting point.\n\n\n2.3.2\nVOM creation\nAll the photographs gathered in the field were prepared before creating the VOM.\nRegarding the photograph selection, not all the photographs taken were necessary to create the VOM. Thus, some photographs, that were redundant, were discarded to make the computing process faster. Later on, more photographs were added to improve the VOM when the initial result was not satisfactory or blank areas arose.\nRegarding the photograph enhancement, we applied photographic filters implemented in the software Adobe Photoshop (https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/es\/products\/photoshop.html) to increment the contrast, brightness, colour balance and\/or saturation to improve the photograph quality, homogenize the pictures and to speed up the process. Other techniques, such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging, were used to improve photographs including very lightened areas entwined with shaded zones, which usually happened when the photographs included both outcrop and sky. When the camera was not equipped with HDR as standard, we used the free software Photomatix (https:\/\/www.hdrsoft.com) to combine a number of shots for each image (typically between three and five) taken with different shutter values. This was an issue when many pictures were required to create the VOM and also when we used an UAV under windy conditions that affected its stability.\nToday there are many personal applications and online applications capable of building 3D models from 2D photographs, some of which work fully automatically. However, we employed an academic license of the software Pix4DMapper (https:\/\/www.pix4d.com\/product\/pix4dmapper-photogrammetry-software) and the free software VisualSfM (http:\/\/ccwu.me\/vsfm) (Wu, 2013) to create the VOMs using the data collected in the field and pre-processed in the laboratory. Regarding VisualSfM, this software follows the Sfm system developed by Wu et al. (2011) (see Carrivick et al., 2016 for a compendium of some applications of Sfm in Earth Sciences), and sorts out both the intrinsic (camera calibration: calculations of focal length, projection centre and radial distortion) and the extrinsic (resection: determining the camera positions for each photograph) calibrations. To carry out these corrections, the software uses the bundle adjustment method (Triggs et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2011), with automatic detection of matching points using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. VisualSfM is also able to load the corresponding parameters and set a fixed calibration if the camera had been calibrated before, which we did for some outcrops. In order to create the point cloud, we ran sparse reconstruction first, so that the bundle adjustment step used multicore bundle adjustment automatically. Subsequently, we carried out a dense reconstruction by using the Patch-based Multi-view Stereo Software (PMVS2) (http:\/\/www.di.ens.fr\/pmvs\/), which is included in the Clustering Views for Multiview Stereo Software package (CMVS) (https:\/\/www.di.ens.fr\/cmvs\/), developed by Y. Furukawa and J. Ponce. This free software grouped the images into manageable packages to make a more exhaustive search, instead of working with all of them at the same time which would be much more expensive from the computational point of view. The package image grouping is based on the previous reconstruction using the bundle adjustment. When working with relatively heavy models we carried out one or more of the following actions: a) down-sample the point cloud for large-scale interpretation when not so much detail was needed using the software Move, b) divide the point cloud into smaller portions to be analysed independently using the software Move, and c) delete areas without interest using initially the software VisualSfm for larger-scale regions and later the software Move for more detailed deleting. From the dense point cloud, the software was also able to generate a triangular textured mesh (Figs. 3a, 4b and 8a). Triangulated textured meshes helped to visualize outcrops, especially when the resulting point clouds were not dense enough. However, in some cases they induced to errors, for instance, when trying to calculate plane orientations by selecting points on the cloud as they simplified the topography or created incorrect connections between the nodes (H\u00f6fle et al., 2009; Lindberg et al., 2013; Cawood et al., 2017). Thus, we always saved the original point cloud as a source since interpolated models may lead to wrong results (Otepka et al., 2013).\n\n\n2.3.3\nVOM georeferencing\nIn the case of VOMs derived from UAV's, the images were georeferenced using their internal GPS. Although the x and y coordinates were accurate, some UAV's yielded errors in the z coordinate. These errors were corrected because the altitude of known points in the studied region was available.\nIn the case of VOMs constructed using photographic cameras mounted on a tripod, if the camera has an integrated GPS, then the VOM is automatically georeferenced. However, our cameras did not have an integrated GPS. Thus, both the VOMs constructed from photographs taken with cameras in the field and from Google Earth images, required georeferencing to perform quantitative geological analyses because their orientation and size were somewhat arbitrary, i.e., they were not correctly positioned, oriented and scaled. The key issue in this case was the acquisition of georeferenced points in the field and on the Google Earth images that were divided in: a) ground control points (GCP), used to georeference the VOM; and b) check points, left out of the VOM building procedure and employed to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model. Georeferencing a point cloud\/mesh requires a minimum of 3 non-linear points, however, in the case of some models that required a lot of detail and\/or the mean error was too high, more points were needed (Harwin and Lucieer, 2012; Ag\u00fcera-Vega et al., 2016; Gindraux et al., 2017; Oniga et al., 2018). The software VisualSfM informed when enough points had been introduced to calculate the required rotation, translation and scaling. Regarding the check points, they were arranged more or less uniformly throughout the whole area of interest and at different depths of view, although zones with less photograph coverage\/overlapping were prioritized. Georeferenced points were obtained using a total station and a high precision GPS which were rented for a low cost. A simpler and cheaper solution to acquire georeferenced points consists of using a laser rangefinder, a compass and a laser level (Tavani et al., 2016), however we did not use this solution because it is slightly less accurate. The point-to-point comparison, done manually, was the method employed to assess the accuracy of the resulting VOMs and estimate their error (Fonstad et al., 2013).\nIn those cases where global coordinates were not necessary, for instance, when the study was focused on a single outcrop and its position with respect to adjacent outcrops was not required, an alternative method was used to extract quantitative information. First of all, we found out surfaces easily identifiable in the field and in the VOM such as bedding, fractures and\/or other surfaces. After that, the orientations of these surfaces were measured in the field using a compass and the orientation of the same elements was measured in the \u201craw\u201d VOM. By calculating the transformation matrix that converts the orientation of the VOM planes into planes with the same orientation than the actual ones and applying it to the point cloud we reorientated the model. To rescale the model, lengths of different elements such as bed thicknesses, fracture spacing and\/or distances between other elements were measured in the field using a tape measure and their values compared to the same distances in the VOM to estimate a scale factor to correct the VOM size. In order to obtain good results, we measured dips and strikes of surfaces with different orientations located at different points within the outcrop, and we measured lengths of different magnitudes along different orientations. The reorientation and rescaling of the VOM was carried out using an in-house software but it may be done using the software Move.\n\n\n2.3.4\nVOM interpretation\nThe resulting VOM, either as a point cloud or as a textured triangular mesh, can be interpreted from the geological point of view using a Computer Assisted Virtual Environment (CAVE) and shutting glasses or using a PC\/Workstation with optional devices such as virtual reality headsets (Figs. 2c, 3b and 4c, 5c, 6b, 7d, 8c, 9b and 10\nc). To do so, we employed the in-house software 3D Stereo VDT (Mart\u00edn et al., 2019) for CAVE, as well as Move and VGRS (http:\/\/www.vgeoscience.com) that run in a PC. The abundant tools to draw lines, polygons and points of different colours, to zoom in and out and to rotate the VOMs, and even to carry out measurements such as distances, make all these software powerful tools, which allowed us to carry out complete geological interpretations. We first interpreted faults and then horizons in different parts of the outcrop and extended the interpretations until they reached each other to tie the geological interpretation, and we also used data, diagrams and photographs taken in the field to constrain the VOMs interpretation.\n\n\n\n2.4\nAdditional photogrammetric techniques\n\n2.4.1\nOrthophotogeological interpretations\nFrom the original photographs taken in the field to construct some of the VOMs and\/or from some of the resulting VOMs, we created orthomosaics that were rectified to build orthophotographs (Tavani et al., 2016) with any desired orientation. This was done employing the software Pix4DMapper, which produced good quality orthophotographs (Figs. 3b and 9b).\nWhen the orthophotographs were generated from field photographs, they were interpreted from the geological point of view using drawing packages such as Adobe Illustrator (https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/es\/products\/illustrator.html) and the free software Inkscape (https:\/\/inkscape.org\/es\/). This allowed us to obtain orthophotogeological interpretations, i.e., intersections of geological contacts between stratigraphic units, faults, etc. with the topographic surface in which all the elements have the same scale, and therefore, they are free of errors and deformations.\nWhen VOMs interpreted from the geological point of view were available, the process of obtaining orthophotogeological interpretations was carried out as follows. The VOM-derived orthophotographs obtained using Pix4DMapper were scaled, but not georeferenced, except for the zenith orthophotographs that were georeferenced. In the case of orthophotographs not georeferenced, first, we managed to georeference the orthophotographs using the software Move and points of known coordinates. Then the geological interpretations of the VOMs were projected using the same direction employed to construct the orthophotographs and to the same plane using the software Move. Eventually they were overlapped onto the orthophotographs using in-house software to create orthophotogeological interpretations.\n\n\n2.4.2\nGeological interpretation of stereoscopical pairs of photographs\nThe employment of this technique required five basic steps: a) photograph acquisition, b) control points acquisition, c) intrinsic and extrinsic calibration, d) photograph rectification, and e) geological interpretation.\nTo photograph the outcrop, we followed some basic rules in order to ensure good quality pictures (Fig. 10b). For instance, we used cameras with fixed-focus lens, whose calibration tends to remain more stable during the whole project and have less optical deformation. Moreover, the pictures were taken with large depths of field to ensure a sharp vision of all the image and, preferably, as HDR images to avoid strong illumination contrasts, i.e., dark and bright areas coexisting. The camera was mounted on a tripod to prevent blurry results. Each stereopair was taken independently, trying to keep the camera looking at the same direction, perpendicular to the outcrop, and moving the camera as parallel as possible to the outcrop face. In general, as it could be expected, the width and height resolutions, i.e., the pixel size of the outcrop, depended on the camera resolution as well as on the distance to the outcrop from the shooting point. The larger the distance, the lower the resolution. The resolution in depth, i.e., parallel to the shooting direction, depended on the two parameters mentioned above, but it was also controlled by the baseline, which is the distance between the two positions of the camera. In general, the larger the displacement, the smaller the uncertainty and, as a consequence, the better the resolution. However, large displacements implied less overlapping between photographs, which meant more stereoscopical pairs of photographs for each area. We tried to find a balance between the voxel size, i.e., the resolution in xyz, and the number of stereoscopical pairs needed.\nAs is the case of other techniques described above, georeferencing the stereopairs required capturing control points in the field. Theoretically three control points per pair were enough, however, we took about eight points. The reader is referred to a section above to find out how these points were acquired.\nTwo calibrations were needed to work with stereopairs of photographs: intrinsic and extrinsic. The former consists of getting the actual focal, centre of projection and distortion coefficients of the camera. This required taking a series of photographs from different positions of a rectangular chessboard pattern and loading them in Stereo Rectification, an in-house software based on the OpenCV library (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008). The latter, also called resection, allowed knowing the relative position of the camera at the shooting moments. To do this, the controls points were used in combination with the same in-house software mentioned above. Before interpreting the stereopairs, the images were rectified by reprojecting the image planes of the two camera positions, so that they fell in the exact same plane, i.e., epipolar configuration.\nThe visualization of the stereo pairs of photographs and their geological interpretation were carried out using Visage, an in-house software for personal computers (Mart\u00edn et al., 2007) based on the open-source library GLSVe (Mart\u00edn et al., 2011). This software required the use shutter glasses and allowed drawing polylines to represent different geological elements.\n\n\n\n2.5\nDeliverables\nDifferent types of information were extracted from the VOMs, orthophotographs and stereoscopical pairs of photographs, which are briefly described below.\n\n2.5.1\nStratigraphic data\nIn this section we briefly describe different procedures used to obtain stratigraphic data (Fig. 9b) necessary to create the structural models.\nFirst, we selected points on bedding surfaces of different layers from base to top in the VOM and obtained their x, y and z coordinates, using the tools implemented in the software 3D Stereo VDT, Move or VGRS. Then we estimated the dip and strike of the layers in the VOM (the procedure to estimate these values is explained below) or used the values measured in the field. Finally, we calculated orthogonal true thicknesses using a script for Python developed by ourselves or manually. This relatively easy method helped to create stratigraphic logs for inaccessible areas as it only required picking points on the bedding surfaces and estimating their dips. The thickness measurements performed in different parts of the outcrop were compared to decipher whether the stratigraphic thickness was constant or variable.\nThe orthophotographs were used as auxiliary tools to help establishing stratigraphic correlations from one edge to the other of several outcrops and refine the structural models. Thus, using the software Adobe Photoshop, portions of orthophotographs showing characteristic strata sequences were cropped, moved and overlaid on images from other areas and\/or fault blocks to compare both stratigraphic sequences.\n\n\n2.5.2\nStructural data\nThe different types of measurements from the structural point of view that we carried out are: orientations, number of times an element was repeated and distances. The orientation of planar elements, such as bedding, unconformities, faults and joints, fold limbs and fold axial surfaces, and that of linear elements, such as fold axes and intersection between beds and unconformities, were obtained by identifying points along these elements in the VOMs, obtaining their x, y and z coordinates using the software 3D Stereo VDT, Move or VGRS, and fitting the points to a plane or line employing the software Move (Banerjee and Mitra, 2004; Fern\u00e1ndez, 2005 amongst others). A minimum of three points are necessary in the case of planes, while a line can be defined using only two points.\nThe interpretation of the VOMs also allowed making a fast assessment of parameters such as fracture density as it was relatively simple and quick to draw fractures in the model, draw a scanline across the fractures, count the fractures that intersect the scanline and divide the resulting number by the scanline length.\nIn addition, measurement of distances such as fault displacement, width of faulted zones, structural relief of a fold and fold wavelength were easily carried out using the tools for length measurements implemented in the software 3D Stereo VDT, Move and VGRS. Alternatively, these measurements were used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the VOMs because once these values were obtained, they were manually compared to values measured directly in the field. See Mart\u00edn et al. (2013, 2019) and Uzkeda et al. (2013, 2018) for further information on structural results obtained from some of the VOMs shown here.\n\n\n2.5.3\n3D geological models\nOnce the most important geological elements on a VOM, such as bedding, unconformities, faults and fold axial surfaces were mapped, we built 3D geological models using the software Move. The procedure employed is briefly described below. We usually started by creating the fault framework and work in each fault block independently. Thus, close points belonging to each horizon were fit to a surface and its dip and strike were calculated, and each portion of surface was extended along strike according to the dip and strike calculated. After that, different 3D dip domains (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2004), in which the dip of the layers was approximately constant, were defined by drawing the axial surfaces corresponding to the boundaries between dip domains. Finally, we interpolated and extrapolated portions of mapped stratigraphic horizons within each dip domain honouring the bedding orientation and the bed thickness. Once the 3D geological model was built, the axial surfaces that bounded the dip domains were erased. We refer the readers to Mart\u00edn et al. (2019) and Uzkeda et al. (2018) for 3D geological models derived from some of the VOMs shown here.\n\n\n2.5.4\nGeological maps and cross-sections\nOther useful results derived from the use of digital techniques are geological maps (Fig. 9b) and cross-sections (Figs. 2c, 4c, 5c, 6b, 7d, 8c and 10c). We used two different ways to generate them briefly described below.\nIf a 3D geological model had been built, geological maps were constructed by intersecting the interpreted geological surfaces with the topography (Fig. 9b). When outcrops had cantilevers, i.e., overhanging rocks, there were portions of the outcrop that had the same x and y coordinates but different z coordinates. Only those portions of the outcrop closest to the horizontal plane used to construct the map were considered. Geological cross-sections were generated by intersecting the interpreted geological surfaces with a vertical, or inclined plane of a chosen orientation (Figs. 7d and 8c). Both geological maps and cross-sections were easily constructed using the tools implemented in the software Move.\nAnother option consists of projecting the geological interpretation carried out on a VOM, orthophotograph or stereoscopical pairs of photographs onto a horizontal plane following a vertical direction in the case of geological maps, or onto a vertical or inclined plane following geologically meaningful directions such as fold axes, strikes of beds, etc. in the case of geological cross-sections (Figs. 2c, 4c, 5c, 6b and 10c). In the case of maps, we removed the z coordinate from the lines representing geological features. In the case of cross sections, this operation was carried out using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/microsoft-365\/excel), specific scripts developed for Phyton and the software Move. This procedure consisted of applying a trigonometric formula to the known x, y and z coordinates of each point belonging to each of the interpreted surfaces (bedding, unconformities, fractures, etc.) in order to obtain the new coordinates on the chosen cross section plane.\nThe second option revealed to be faster, as it does not require to build surfaces to construct a 3D geological model, and more suitable for essentially \u201cflat\u201d outcrops such as cliff faces or road trenches, while the first method resulted to be more efficient in the case of outcrops with salients and recesses.\n\n\n\n\n3\nGeological setting\nThe virtual outcrops presented here involve carbonate rocks of Devonian and Carboniferous age, and of Jurassic age. The Palaeozoic rocks, affected mainly by folds and thrusts, belong to the Cantabrian Zone, the foreland fold and thrust belt of the Variscan orogen in northwest Iberia developed in Carboniferous times (Fig. 1). This orogen displays an arcuate orocline shape known as Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arch (Lotze, 1945). The contractional mountain range developed during the Variscan orogeny was dismantled by an erosive episode. After that, a Permian-Triassic rift responsible for normal faults, in some cases resulting from reactivation of previous Variscan structures (Lepvrier and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1990), propitiated the Asturian basin origin (Fig. 1). The subsequent thermal subsidence event during Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, was followed by an extensional stage that lasted from the end of Early Jurassic until the beginning of Late Jurassic and consisted of development of normal faults, reactivation of previous ones, heating and uplift (Uzkeda et al., 2016). From the Late Jurassic to the lower part of the Early Cretaceous (pre-Barremian) another extensional event caused the reactivation of previous normal faults (Alonso et al., 2018). This episode was related to the rift responsible for the Bay of Biscay opening. From middle Early Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous, a thermal subsidence episode occurred. Convergence between the Iberian and Eurasian tectonic plates during the middle-late part of the Eocene to the beginning of the Miocene (\u00c1lvarez\u2010Marr\u00f3n et al., 1997; Gallastegui, 2000) caused the Alpine orogeny. This contractional event, responsible for the Cantabrian Mountains formation, involved selective reactivation of previous structures, generation of new thrusts and uplift (Lepvrier and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1990; Pulgar et al., 1999; Alonso et al., 2009; Uzkeda et al., 2016). The structural framework constructed during this contractional event was exhumed during the late part of the Eocene to the beginning of the Oligocene (Fillon et al., 2016), making visible the outcrops in the southern slope of the mountains presented here. During Early Pleistocene or before (\u00c1lvarez-Marr\u00f3n et al., 2008) a narrow coastal strip of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic rocks were eroded, unconformably covered by Quaternary sediments and uplifted above the present-day sea level (e.g., Flor, 1983; Mary, 1983). The emergence of the coastal area, from which various VOMs presented here have been obtained, was accompanied by neotectonic activity such as faulting (e.g., Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol et al., 2006; \u00c1lvarez-Marr\u00f3n et al., 2008) and small magnitude earthquakes (e.g., L\u00f3pez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2004).\n\n\n4\nNorth-Northwest Iberia VOMs\n\n4.1\nCantabrian Zone\nThe Cantabrian Zone is the foreland fold-and-thrust belt of the Northwest-Iberia Variscan Orogen developed during Carboniferous times (Lotze, 1945; Julivert et al., 1972) (Fig. 1). The Cantabrian Zone involves a Palaeozoic stratigraphic succession from Cambrian to Carboniferous, made up of both siliciclastic (slates, sandstones and microconglomerates) and carbonate (marls, limestones and dolomites) sedimentary rocks with sporadic coal beds and volcanic rocks. This zone developed under diagenetic conditions although some localities reached very low or low-grade metamorphism. It is a typical thin-skinned belt, constituted by different types of thrust systems and folds, where tectonic foliations are lacking except for small areas (e.g., Julivert, 1971, 1983; Savage, 1979, 1981; P\u00e9rez-Esta\u00fan et al., 1988; P\u00e9rez-Esta\u00fan and Bastida, 1990; Aller et al., 2004). In cross section, the Cantabrian Zone exhibits a wedge geometry thinning eastwards, i.e., towards the foreland. In map view, it displays a curved trend around an approximately E\u2013W axial surface with the core to the east, known as Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc.\n\n4.1.1\nCacabillo\nThe Cacabillo outcrop is located in the almost inaccessible slope of a valley near the Cacabillo village, in the southwestern portion of the Cantabrian Zone close to the core of the Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc, where NW\u2013SE trending structures predominate (Fig. 1). The outcrop is located in the hinge zone of the several kilometres long Cacabillo anticline (Navarro-V\u00e1zquez and Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez, 1978), also known as Puerto de Somiedo anticline (Bastida et al., 1984) (Fig. 2a). This anticline is a NW\u2013SE trending, tight fold with a subvertical axial surface. A subvertical, NW\u2013SE trending fault of small displacement in the core of the Cacabillo\/Puerto de Somiedo anticline separates the southwest limb from the hinge and the northeast limb. This anticline, mapped in Navarro-V\u00e1zquez and Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez (1978), Bastida et al. (1984), Alonso et al. (1989) and Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014), involves an Ordovician-Carboniferous succession (Fig. 2a) and was developed during the Variscan orogeny.\nA VOM was created using georeferenced Google Earth images (Fig. 2b), and an undistorted geological cross-section was constructed by projecting the geological interpretation of the VOM onto a selected plane (Fig. 2c). Below is a description of the outcrop derived from the VOM geological interpretation and from the cross section.\nThe rocks shown in the virtual outcrop belong to two Devonian stratigraphic units according to the available geological maps and sections (Navarro-V\u00e1zquez et al., 1982). The upper unit, the Santa Luc\u00eda Fm., is a limestone unit with sparse marls and slates, whereas the lower unit, La Vid Gr., is mainly made up of dolostones, slates, limestones and marls. The grey layers that stand out in the relief correspond to the limestones of the Santa Lucia Fm., while the lower regions where layers are hardly recognized correspond to La Vid Gr. (Fig. 2b and c). The outcrop consists of a fold train formed by two anticlines and two synclines whose dimensions reach hundreds of meters. The limbs of each fold dip towards opposite senses and the axial surfaces are subvertical. Several planar faults, whose displacement can reach a hundred meters, cut and offset the folds; in particular, they are well developed in the southwest limbs of the folds and dip in opposite sense to that of the limbs. Folded thrusts, responsible for the repetition of some beds within the Santa Lucia Fm., have also been identified. These thrusts develop flats in most of their trajectory, although some ramps are recognized, especially near the hinge of the anticline located to the northeast. These folds and faults are second-order structures developed in the hinge of the larger-scale Cacabillo\/Puerto de Somiedo anticline, which contribute to its thickening. We refer the reader to Mart\u00edn et al. (2019) for more information on the features of this virtual outcrop.\n\n\n4.1.2\nLas Palomas\nThis outcrop, located on the steep slope of a local road near Las Palomas bridge, belongs to the southwestern portion of the Cantabrian Zone close to the Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc core, where NW\u2013SE trending structures are common (Fig. 1). The outcrop is located in the southwest limb of the kilometre-scale Vega de Los Viejos syncline (Navarro-V\u00e1zquez et al., 1982), a tight, NW-SE trending syncline whose axial surface is subvertical (Fig. 2a). This large syncline, developed during the Variscan orogeny, involves an Ordovician-Carboniferous succession, and its southwestern limb is unconformable covered by Uppermost Carboniferous deposits as shown in the geological maps and sections by Navarro-V\u00e1zquez and Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez (1978), Bastida et al. (1984), Alonso et al. (1989) and Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014) (Fig. 2a).\nA VOM was created from pictures taken in the field with a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 3a). Subsequently, an orthophotograph derived from the VOM was geologically interpreted in order to obtain a geological cross section (Fig. 3c). A description of the outcrop, based on the visualization and geological interpretation of the VOM, orthophotograph and cross section, is presented in the next paragraph.\nThe rocks displayed in the virtual outcrop are limestones that belong to the Barcaliente Fm. of Carboniferous age according to Navarro-V\u00e1zquez et al. (1982) (Fig. 3a and b). The outcrop is formed by a train of metre-scale folds. In general, the axial surfaces of the folds dip steeply to the NE and the limbs of most folds dip towards opposite directions. There is a thick, competent limestone layer the middle part of the stratigraphic succession. Below this layer, the limestones are thinly bedded, while above it they have an intermediate thickness in between that of the thinly bedded layers and that of the thick layer. This competent layer behaves differently from the over- and underlying layers and in turn it is the boundary between mechanically different behaviours. Thus, this layer gives rise to a box syncline and a box anticline in the central part of the outcrop. The beds above this limestone layer exhibit hinge collapses in the anticline illustrated on the left side of the image, while the beds below this limestone layer are folded by many minor folds on the right side of the image. The anticlines and synclines illustrated in this VOM are second-order folds that have contributed to thicken the southwest limb of the larger-scale Vega de Los Viejos syncline. The syncline shown in the central part of the outcrop has been described in Poblet et al. (2022).\n\n\n4.1.3\nSan Emiliano\nThis outcrop is located on the steep slope of a road near the San Emiliano village, in the southwest portion of the Cantabrian Zone and in the southern branch of the Ibero-Armorican Arc, where E-W trending structures dominate (Fig. 1). The outcrop is located in the north limb of the kilometre-scale Huergas-Valgrande anticline (Marcos, 1968), also known as Villasecino anticline (De Sitter and Van den Bosch, 1969) (Fig. 4a). This anticline is a tight and approximately upright fold that strikes E\u2013W. A subvertical, E-W trending fault runs along the core of the anticline. This regional-scale anticline, interpreted as a Variscan fold that involves a Cambrian to Carboniferous stratigraphic succession, has been displayed in several geological maps and cross sections (De Sitter, 1962; Marcos, 1968; Mart\u00ednez-\u00c1lvarez et al., 1968; Alonso et al., 1989; Su\u00e1rez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 1991; Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2014) (Fig. 4a).\nA VOM was created using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 4b), and a cross section was obtained from the projection of the VOM geological interpretation onto a selected plane (Fig. 4c). The description of the outcrop below comes from the visualization and geological interpretation of the VOM and the cross section.\nThe rocks shown in the virtual outcrop belong to the Carboniferous Alba (or Genicera) Fm., colloquially known as \u201cCarboniferous griotte limestone\u201d, according to the available geological maps (Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 1991) (Fig. 4b and c). In outline, this outcrop consists of a homoclinal set of layers that dip steeply to the NNW. Taking into account the behaviour of the layers regarding deformation, they may be divided into three mechanical units. The lower mechanical unit, located to the south-southeast, is mainly made up of red limestones (\u201cgriotte\u201d facies) affected by large folds and faults, and the faults dip steeply. The intermediate mechanical unit, located in the central part of the outcrop, is formed by alternations of radiolarites and slates, and both folds and faults are more abundant than in the lower unit, they are smaller, and the faults display a wide range of dips. In the upper mechanical unit, located to the north-northwest and constituted by grey limestones with some reddish shale interbeds, the faults are scarce. According to Masini et al. (2010a) this outcrop was tilted in a counter clockwise sense around an ENE-WSW subhorizontal axis. The structures make sense from the geological point of view when removing this rotation until the layers reach a sub-horizontal position. Thus, the lower mechanical unit corresponds to a thrust ramp anticline located in the hangingwall of a series of thrusts that dip to the N in the rotated image. This lower unit is detached from the underlying units (south-southeast main fault in Fig. 4c). A detachment located at the top of the lower unit separates this unit from the intermediate unit (central main fault in Fig. 4c). The intermediate mechanical unit displays several detachment folds with abundant minor thrusts. Another detachment separates the intermediate from the upper unit. The upper mechanical unit is almost undeformed. These structures are responsible for thickening the north limb of the larger-scale Huergas-Valgrande\/Villasecino anticline. This virtual outcrop is presented here for the very first time, however, the reader can consult Masini et al. (2010b) and Bulnes et al. (2019) for further information on this outcrop.\n\n\n4.1.4\nLa Ballota\nThis outcrop is a coastal cliff located in La Ballota Beach, in the northeastern part of the Cantabrian Zone and in the north branch of the Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc, where E\u2013W trending structures are the most common ones (Fig. 1). La Ballota outcrop is only accessible during periods of low tide. The outcrop is located in the north limb of a hundred-metres long anticline located to the north of the Cue anticline (Fig. 5a). This anticline is a tight, E-W striking fold, whose axial surface dips steeply to the N. This anticline is interpreted as a ramp fold located in the hangingwall of an E\u2013W, S-directed thrust that dips steeply to the N. This anticline is supposed to be a Variscan structure that involves an Ordovician, Devonian and Carboniferous succession according to the geological maps and sections constructed by Mart\u00ednez-\u00c1lvarez (1965), Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda (1980), Marqu\u00ednez (1989), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014), De Ana (2015) and Bulnes et al. (2016) (Fig. 5a).\nA VOM was constructed using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 5b), and a cross section was obtained from the projection of the geological interpretation onto a selected plane (Fig. 5c). The main features of the outcrop are described below based on the geological interpretation of the VOM and on the cross section.\nAccording to Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. (1981) this outcrop is composed of limestones with slates that belong to the Carboniferous Alba Fm., also known as Genicera Fm. (Fig. 5b and c). This outcrop includes a very tight anticline in the north-northwest part and a closed syncline that occupies the central and south-southeast part of the outcrop. The hinge of the anticline shows extraordinary thickening at some incompetent stratigraphic levels. Both folds are a few metres wide and tall, and their axial surfaces are subvertical. The layers are cut and offset by abundant metre-scale, SSE directed thrusts whose dip varies from horizontal to subvertical since they are folded by the anticline and the syncline. In most of the trajectory of these thrusts, hangingwall flats over footwall flats occur, although some hangingwall and footwall ramps occur as well, specially near the anticline hinge and towards the south-southeast portion of the outcrop. Thus, this outcrop is basically a stack of folded thrust sheets. The axial surface of the folds, and in particular that of the syncline, do not exhibit a rectilinear path in cross-sectional view from the upper layers to the lower ones, but display \u201cjumps\u201d from one thrust sheet to the underlying one. The reason is that bedding surfaces were not parallel before folding because they had been cut and offset by thrusts. All these structures contributed to thicken the north limb of the larger-scale anticline located to the north of the Cue anticline.\n\n\n4.1.5\nAndr\u00edn\nThis outcrop is a coastal cliff located in the Andr\u00edn Beach, in the northeastern part of the Cantabrian Zone and in the north branch of the Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc, where the structures trend E\u2013W (Fig. 1). The outcrop can only be visited during low tide periods. The outcrop belongs to the north limb (backlimb) of the kilometre-scale Cue anticline (Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al., 1981), a closed, E\u2013W striking fold, whose axial surface dips steeply to the N (Fig. 5a). The Cue anticline is interpreted as a ramp fold located in the hangingwall of an E\u2013W thrust that dips steeply to the N and whose hangingwall exhibits a southwards sense of motion. The Cue anticline, developed during the Variscan orogeny, involves an Ordovician, Devonian and Carboniferous succession as shown in the available geological maps and sections (Mart\u00ednez-\u00c1lvarez, 1965; Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1980; Marqu\u00ednez, 1989; Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2014; De Ana, 2015; Bulnes et al., 2016) (Fig. 5a).\nA VOM was constructed using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 6a) and its geological interpretation was projected onto a selected plane to construct an undistorted geological cross-section (Fig. 6b). An outcrop description derived from the VOM interpretation and from the geological cross-section is presented below.\nThe studied virtual outcrop consists of red limestones that belong to the Carboniferous Alba (or Genicera) Fm. according to the available geological maps (Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al., 1981) (Fig. 6a and b). In the southeastern part of the outcrop, several metre-scale, tight anticlines and synclines, whose hinges exhibit thickening with respect to the limbs and whose limbs dip to the same direction, appear. The axial surfaces of these folds are curve; thus, they dip moderately upsection but progressively become gently dipping to the SE until they are subhorizontal downsection because they have subsequently been refolded by another set of folds, giving rise to type 3 fold interference patterns (Ramsay, 1967). All these structures are located in the hangingwall of a decametre-scale, NW-directed reverse fault that dips steeply to the S and appears in the central part of the outcrop. In the footwall of this fault, i.e., in the northwestern part of the outcrop, a large syncline and a smaller anticline with thickened hinges, NW-dipping limbs and SW-dipping axial surfaces crop out. This virtual outcrop was presented in Mart\u00edn et al. (2019), however, its structural features are described here for the very first time.\n\n\n\n4.2\nAsturian Basin\nThe Asturian Basin is an inverted extensional basin that crops out along the North Iberian Margin and extends northwards under the Cantabrian Sea (Fig. 1). This basin is filled in with a Permian-Triassic siliciclastic succession including some volcanoclastic, carbonate and evaporitic deposits, a Lower-Middle Jurassic succession composed of marls and limestones, an Upper Jurassic succession formed by marls, shales and sandstones with some limestones, and Cretaceous alternations of siliciclastic and carbonate rocks (Garc\u00eda-Ramos and Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol, 1995). The two most important angular unconformities within the basin are located in between the Permian-Triassic succession and the Variscan basement of the Cantabrian Zone, and between the Lower Jurassic marine successions and the continental\/transitional Upper Jurassic rocks (Valenzuela et al., 1986). The internal structure of the basin mainly consists of Mesozoic normal faults of different orientations, some of them reactivated as reverse, oblique or strike-slip faults during a Cenozoic contractional episode, responsible for different modes of inversion tectonics from pure fault reactivation to buttressing structures (e.g., Lepvrier and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1990; Uzkeda et al., 2016).\n\n4.2.1\nCervig\u00f3n\nThis outcrop is a small part of a coastal cliff located in the Pe\u00f1arrubia Beach, near the Cervig\u00f3n viewpoint, in the north-northwest part of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin (Fig. 1). Stones may fall from the top of the high cliff where the outcrop is located and the outcrop can only be visited during low tide periods. According to the available geological maps, the outcrop is located in the southwest limb of a kilometre-scale, very open syncline whose trend is NW-SE and involves a Jurassic succession (Fig. 7a and b). The portion of the basin where this outcrop is located was mapped in Beroiz et al. (1972b), Su\u00e1rez-Vega (1974), Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol et al. (2002), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014) and Odriozola (2016).\nThe VOM constructed using images taken with a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 7c) was the basis for a 3D geological model. A geological cross-section was obtained from the intersection of 3D geological surfaces with a selected plane (Fig. 7d). An outcrop description, derived from the geological interpretation of the VOM, and from the 3D model and geological cross-section, is presented below.\nThe studied virtual outcrop consists of marls and limestones that belong to the Rodiles Fm. of lower Early Jurassic age in this region (Su\u00e1rez-Vega, 1974) (Fig. 7c and d). The most striking structures in this outcrop are a metre-scale monoclinal anticline and a monoclinal syncline; these open folds are asymmetric and their axial surfaces dip moderately to the E. Two metre-scale, W-directed reverse faults with small displacement are developed in the hinge zone of the folds. The asymmetry of the folds, the sense of motion of the reverse faults and the cross-cutting relationships with other structures, which will be discussed below, suggest that these folds and faults have a genetic relationship. The tip of the lower reverse fault ends up against the syncline axial surface, while the other reverse fault involves upper stratigraphic horizons, runs through the common limb between the two folds and ends upsection as a hangingwall flat over a footwall flat. This suggests that the structure could be a fault-propagation fold related to the lower fault, while the other reverse fault would correspond to a breakthrough fault. An E-directed detachment, folded and offset by a reverse fault, occurs in the middle part of the stratigraphic succession. This detachment, in turn, cuts and offsets a metre-scale, E-directed normal fault with small displacement located in between the anticline and syncline hinges. The outcrop also includes a series of subvertical strike-slip faults; although these faults cut and offset the detachment, their temporal relationship with the folds, and the reverse and normal faults, are difficult to define since they develop in regions where the layers are flat-lying. Thus, apart from the strike-slip faults, the chronology of the structures would start with a normal fault, followed by a detachment, and finally the folds and reverse faults. The geometry of these structures suggests that the whole structure resulted from positive inversion tectonics so that the anticline hinge would nucleate in the normal fault hangingwall while the syncline in the footwall. The reader is referred to Uzkeda et al. (2018) for more information regarding this virtual outcrop.\n\n\n4.2.2\nBuerres\nThis outcrop is a coastal cliff located near the Huerres village, also called Buerres, in the north-northeast portion of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin (Fig. 1). The cliff where the outcrop is located is high, so that stones can fall, and the outcrop can only be visited during low tide periods. The studied outcrop is located in the downthrown block of the Lastres fault, very close to the fault surface (Fig. 8a). This kilometre-scale, normal fault exhibits a NW-SE strike, dips steeply to the SW and involves Jurassic rocks (Uzkeda, 2013). The region around the studied outcrop was mapped by Beroiz et al. (1972a), Su\u00e1rez-Vega (1974), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014) and Uzkeda et al. (2016) (Fig. 8a).\nA VOM was obtained using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 8b). Its geological interpretation was used to construct a 3D geological model and the intersection of 3D geological surfaces with a plane allowed us to construct a geological cross-section (Fig. 8c). Below is a description of the outcrop derived from the visualization and geological interpretation of the VOM and from the geological cross-section.\nThe virtual outcrop analysed here involves marls and limestones that belong to the Rodiles Fm., whose age in this region ranges from Early to Middle Jurassic (Su\u00e1rez-Vega, 1974) (Fig. 8b and c). One of the most important structures in this outcrop is a metre-scale, SSE-directed fault, that currently exhibits normal motion, dips steeply to the SSE, and is located in the north-northwest edge of the outcrop. In the fault hanginwall, the layers are affected by a metre-scale, smooth anticline-syncline pair. The axial surfaces of these folds are subvertical, but the folds are slightly asymmetric since the south-southeast limb of the anticline is somewhat shorter and its dip is steeper than that of the north-northwest limb. The folded layers are cut and offset by a set of metre-scale, reverse faults with small displacements and gently dips to both the SSE and the NNW. They are thrusts and backthrusts. The cross-cutting relationships between the SSE-dipping and the NNW-dipping thrusts are complex, as some SSE-dipping thrusts cut and offset some NNW-dipping thrusts, but the opposite situation also occurs. This indicates that thrusts and backthrusts are approximately synchronous. Both the anticline-syncline pair and the thrusts and backthrusts are probably simultaneous structures. Since all these structures are only developed in the hangingwall of the normal fault very close to it, they are interpreted as buttressing structures. This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that the hangingwall succession includes more marls and shales than that in the fault footwall, i.e., the hangingwall rocks are less competent than the footwall ones. Thus, the initially normal fault was responsible for a buttressing effect and was reactivated as a reverse fault giving rise to a positive tectonic inversion structure. The reader is addressed to Uzkeda et al. (2018) for further information on this virtual outcrop.\n\n\n4.2.3\nPe\u00f1arrubia\nThis outcrop covers part of the coastal cliff, part of the beach and part of the platform located in the Pe\u00f1arrubia Beach, in the north-northwest part of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin (Fig. 1). Stones may fall from the upper parts of the high cliff and the platform can only be accessed during low tide periods. The outcrop comprises the hinge zone and both limbs of a kilometre-scale, NW-SE trending syncline. This smooth fold involves a Jurassic succession (Fig. 7a). Several geological maps illustrate the portion of the basin where this outcrop is located (Beroiz et al., 1972b; Su\u00e1rez-Vega, 1974; Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol et al., 2002; Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2014; Odriozola, 2016).\nA VOM created using a photographic camera mounted on an UAV (Fig. 9a) was used to construct a 3D geological model. A geological map was obtained from the interpretation of the 3D geological model overlapped onto an orthophotograph of the outcrop (Fig. 9b). The geological description presented below is derived from the VOM geological interpretation, as well as from the 3D geological model and the geological map.\nThis virtual outcrop is made up of alternations of marls and limestones that belong to the Rodiles Fm., which in this region has a lower Early Jurassic age, as well as of conglomerates, sandstones and shales of La \u00d1ora Fm., whose age is Upper Jurassic according to Su\u00e1rez-Vega (1974) (Fig. 9a and b). From a stratigraphic point of view, the map clearly shows an angular unconformity in between La \u00d1ora Fm. and the Rodiles Fm., so that in the southwestern part of the outcrop La \u00d1ora Fm. lays on older Rodiles Fm. beds (stratigraphic log C1 in Fig. 9b) than in the northeast part of the outcrop (stratigraphic log C2 in Fig. 9b). Regarding the structure, several NE-SW trending anticlines and synclines of hectometre lengths are recognized. Various faults have been also mapped. Most of these faults strike from ENE-WSW to NE-SW, reach a few hundred meters length, and cut and offset the traces of the aforementioned folds pointing out that they are younger.\n\n\n4.2.4\nLa Conejera\nThis outcrop is a coastal cliff located in La Conejera Inlet, in the north-northeast part of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin (Fig. 1). Stones may fall from the high cliff where the outcrop is located and part of the outcrop can only be visited during low tide periods. According to Uzkeda et al. (2013), this outcrop is supposed to show part of the kilometre-scale Villaviciosa fault (Fig. 10a). This fault is a NE-SW striking structure with vertical or steep dip to the SE that involves Mesozoic rocks in both fault blocks. The outcrop and surrounding regions were mapped by Pignatelli et al. (1972), Su\u00e1rez-Vega (1974), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014), Uzkeda et al. (2016) and Granado et al. (2018) (Fig. 10a).\nStereoscopical pairs of photographs of the outcrop were obtained using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 10b), and a geological cross-section was obtained from the projection of the geological interpretation onto two selected planes (Fig. 10c). We describe the outcrop below according to our geological interpretation of the stereoscopical pairs and to the geological cross-section.\nThe marls and limestones that make up the studied virtual outcrop belong to the Rodiles Fm., with an age of Early Jurassic in this area (Su\u00e1rez-Vega, 1974) (Fig. 10b and c). Two are the most important structures in this outcrop and both are located in the centre-northwest part of the outcrop. The first structure is a decametre-scale, normal fault that dips steeply to the SE and causes a notable layer displacement. The second one is a decametre-scale, open monoclinal anticline, whose southeast limb is subhorizontal whereas its northwest limb dips moderately to the NW against the fault mentioned above. The geometry of this monocline and its development in the hangingwall of the mentioned fault suggest that it could be interpreted as a rollover anticline related to the normal fault motion. On a metre-scale, there are abundant normal and reverse faults as well as folds. Reverse faults and folds postdate normal faults, are only developed in the hangingwall of the main fault and their density increases from the southeast towards the mentioned fault, while the interlimb angle of the folds decreases from the southeast towards the mentioned fault. The variation in the characteristics of these smaller-scale structures and their structural position suggest that they resulted from a buttressing phenomenon against the main normal fault causing its reactivation as a reverse fault. The fact that the rocks located in the footwall of the normal fault exhibit higher limestone and lesser marl contents than those located in the hangingwall is in agreement with this hypothesis. Thus, the overall structure of this outcrop resulted from positive inversion tectonics. We refer the reader to Uzkeda et al. (2013) for further information about the features of this virtual outcrop.\n\n\n\n\n5\nFinal considerations\nThere is no doubt that the application of digital techniques to the study of natural geological structures is a significant advance in Structural Geology, facilitating the process of collecting and processing field data and, in some situations, supplying additional information that would have been hard to obtain using traditional techniques solely. Once the images of the structures, their geological interpretation, as well as additional data, are \u201cinside\u201d our computer, a world of possibilities opens up to extract the information as geological maps and sections in any direction of space, as well as 3D geological models, which makes understanding them much faster and easier.\nGiven their benefits, we encourage all the structural geologists to use digital techniques and create more VOMs all over the world. In this sense, this work might help all those structural geologists who would like to use digital techniques to construct 3D geological models, geological cross-sections and maps, and obtain additional structural data, from outcrops of natural structures.\nAll the north-northwest Iberia outcrops studied here involve steep slopes (valley slopes, road slopes, coastal cliffs). On the one hand, the analysis of the VOMs has allowed obtaining dips, strikes and dip directions of layers, unconformities, faults, joints, fold limbs, fold axial surfaces, fold axes and intersection lines between beds and unconformities, located in the inaccessible parts of the outcrops. On the other hand, outcrops such as Cacabillo, La Ballota, Andr\u00edn, Cervig\u00f3n and La Conejera exhibit abundant inlets and outlets that make it difficult to correctly visualize and graphically represent the structures. However, the construction of VOMs has made it possible to visualize the 3D structural complexity and project the interpretations onto undistorted 2D geological sections, which has greatly facilitated their understanding. In the case of large outcrops such as Cacabillo, Pe\u00f1arrubia and La Conejera, the geological interpretation of the VOMs has permitted establishing local stratigraphic columns at outcrop scale, which has allowed the layers to be correlated from one edge to the other edge of the outcrop, and hence better understand the structures that affect them.\nThe most obvious use of the VOMs of the north-northwest Iberian Peninsula presented here is related to research and involves deciphering their main structural features. However, they also represent a contribution as a virtual fieldtrip across this part of the world, and are interesting from the teaching point of view as well, especially if they are incorporated into platforms specifically designed for these purposes, such as 3DGaia (https:\/\/www.imagedreality.com\/3d-gaia-vr-app). Regarding virtual fieldtrips and teaching, these VOMs could help Earth Science professionals and students to figure out the structural styles of the Cantabrian Zone and the Asturian Basin, as well as to learn about contractional and inversion tectonics structures. Thus, they can remotely visualize the VOMs from different perspectives, interpret them and understand these outcrops located in regions of difficult access (steep slopes, cliffs by the sea, intertidal regions) at any time, but specially during times when carrying out fieldwork is not possible because of travel restrictions caused by pandemics or similar situations. In addition, these VOMs allow costs to be reduced because the virtual fieldtrips can be repeated as many times as desired and involve less travel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint, while increasing the visibility of the geology of this part of the world as well as equality, since the outcrops are accessible to people with disabilities.\nThe digital techniques have led to a sort of \u201crevolution\u201d within the Structural Geology, that advances day by day, and to which we should be aware, however, we believe we must continue combining both traditional and digital techniques because we found all of them useful and complimentary.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nHodei Uzkeda: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Investigation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization.

These bed-parallel veins commonly contain fibrous to prismatic mineral fill with fibers perpendicular to fracture walls (termed \u201cbeef\u201d), and are typically composed of calcite, gypsum, or quartz (Cobbold et al., 2013). The vertical opening of these veins has generally been interpreted as evidence of fluid overpressure related to seepage forces (Cobbold and Rodriguez, 2007) or tectonic stress (Ukar et al., 2017; Hooker et al., 2019; Abaab et al., 2021; Ferrill et al., 2021). In the case of calcite beef veins, vertical opening and vein formation as a result of overpressure has been attributed to local hydrocarbon generation and associated increases in pore pressure (Stoneley, 1983; Cobbold et al., 2013).\nBed-parallel fibrous opening-mode veins have been observed associated with contractional folds in mudstone and evaporites, with curved fibers indicating a component of fold-related shear (Abaab et al., 2021). Where bed-parallel opening-mode veins occur in the hinges of tight folds as saddle reefs (Ramsay, 1974; Ramsay and Huber, 1987), these are generally interpreted as having formed at a relatively late stage of fold formation, during fold tightening, rather than during early folding and amplification. Bed-parallel opening-mode veins that are laterally continuous across contractional folds have also been recognized (Henderson et al., 1986, 1990), but in contrast to late-stage saddle reef structures, these have been interpreted as having formed in flat-lying strata prior to fold formation and amplification.\nBed-parallel fibrous quartz and calcite veins with fibers parallel to bedding are also common in folded sedimentary strata (Ramsay and Huber, 1987; Tanner, 1989; Jessell et al., 1994). These veins with bed-parallel fibers are commonly formed as stepped crystal-fiber slickensides, representing shear or hybrid failure, and often developed during flexural-slip folding (Ramsay and Huber, 1983, 1987; Tanner, 1989; Jessell et al., 1994; Rybak-Ostrowska et al., 2014). Similar bed-parallel fibrous veins and bed-parallel or bed-oblique fibers or elongate grains have been interpreted as having formed along subhorizontal detachments prior to folding and subsequently folded (Fitches et al., 1986; Jessell et al., 1994). These bedding-plane-slip related veins are kinematically distinct from the opening-mode bed-parallel veins with bed-perpendicular fibers investigated in this study.\nThis paper documents outcrop investigations of the Cretaceous Boquillas Formation (lateral equivalent of the Eagle Ford self-sourced oil and gas reservoir in south Texas) exposed along Highway 90 east of the town of Langtry, Texas (Fig. 1\n), where gypsum beef and calcite veins are associated with a broad, low-amplitude (\u2018gentle\u2019 in terminology of Ramsay, 1967) anticline. Structural geologic analyses of fold geometry and bed-parallel veins are used to assess the relationship between folding and bed-parallel vein development in organic-rich source rock strata that never reached hydrocarbon generation conditions. Fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analyses of veins, along with cross-cutting relationships, are used to constrain depth of burial and fluid history associated with vein system development. These results document thrust regime deformation near the Laramide contractional front, and have relevance to deformation and associated structures in low-permeability fine-grained sedimentary strata and self-sourced hydrocarbon reservoirs.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe Boquillas Formation is the lateral equivalent of the Eagle Ford Formation, a major self-sourced (unconventional) oil and gas reservoir in south Texas (Treadgold et al., 2010; Breyer, 2016; Breyer et al., 2016). Hydrocarbon production from the Eagle Ford Formation, like other unconventional reservoirs, is dependent on mechanical stratigraphy, natural deformation fabrics in the rock, and in-situ stress conditions (Ferrill et al., 2014a; Bodziak et al., 2014). Natural deformation features within the Eagle Ford Formation in the productive trend of south Texas (primarily between the Rio Grande and the San Marcos Arch) include extensional structures around the margin of the Gulf of Mexico Basin. Reservoir-scale extensional deformation in the Eagle Ford Formation and laterally equivalent Boquillas Formation is widely recognized and has been documented in several recent studies (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017a, 2017c, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c; McGinnis et al., 2017; Gottardi and Mason, 2018). Contractional structures, such as the Chittim anticline, formed in the Eagle Ford and Boquillas Formations during the Laramide Orogeny (Rose, 1984; Scott, 2010; Ewing, 2016). Approximately the western one third (by area) of the potentially productive subsurface Eagle Ford play in south Texas lies west of the Laramide macrostructural front (Fig. 1) as defined by Ferrill et al. (2020a), where distributed small-scale contractional deformation is likely (e.g., Ferrill et al., 2016; 2017b; 2020b, 2021).\n\n2.1\nStratigraphy\nThe Boquillas Formation and laterally equivalent Eagle Ford Formation were deposited during the Late Cretaceous (ca. 98-90\u00a0Ma; Minisini et al., 2018) sea level highstand across the northwest Gulf of Mexico Basin and intersection with the western interior seaway (Hovorka and Nance, 1994; Goldhammer and Johnson, 2001; Lock and Peschier, 2006; Donovan and Staerker, 2010; Lock et al., 2010; Donovan et al., 2012, 2016; Phelps et al., 2013; Eldrett et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b; Denne and Breyer, 2016; Rose, 2016; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). In detail, the Boquillas Formation represents a complex assemblage of calcareous mudrock, chalk, limestone, and volcanic ash (Lock and Peschier, 2006; Hentz and Ruppel, 2010; Scott, 2010; Lock et al., 2010; Fr\u00e9bourg et al., 2016; Lehrmann et al., 2019). Cyclic alternation between chalk and mudrock in the Boquillas Formation and equivalent Eagle Ford Formation have been attributed to climate cycling (Eldrett et al., 2015b; Lehrmann et al., 2019). Bed-scale variations in composition and texture in the Boquillas and Eagle Ford Formations define mechanical layering that has been shown to strongly influence brittle deformation including extension fracturing (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017b; McGinnis et al., 2017), normal faulting (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017a, 2017c), and small-scale thrust faulting (Ferrill et al., 2016) in these formations.\n\n\n2.2\nStructural and tectonic setting\nThe study area is within approximately 10\u00a0km of the NW-SE trending Laramide macrostructural front, which is interpreted from the distribution of contractional macrostructures in Cretaceous strata (Fig. 1; Ferrill et al., 2020a). Regionally, the Laramide macrostructural front steps eastward from the Marathon uplift to the west (Turner et al., 2011; Surpless et al., 2015; Surpless and Wigginton, 2020), following the northern edge of the Devils River uplift to the east (Webster, 1980; Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Nicholas, 1983), then bending southeast into south Texas to include the Zavala syncline, Chittim anticline, and Eagle syncline near the Rio Grande (Fowler, 1956; Rose, 1984). Laramide contraction (\u223c80\u201340\u00a0Ma) deformed Cretaceous strata across northeast Mexico, and south and west Texas (Goldhammer and Johnson, 2001; Lehman, 1991). Laramide structures include large-scale folds and thrust faults (e.g., Fowler, 1956; Webster, 1980; Maxwell, 1967; Moustafa, 1988; Erdlac, 1990; Turner et al., 2011), as well as distributed small-scale faults, folds, tectonic stylolites, joints, and veins (e.g., Moustafa, 1988; Erdlac, 1990; Ferrill et al., 2016, 2021; Surpless and Wigginton, 2020).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nLithostratigraphy and mechanical stratigraphic characterization\nA lithostratigraphic section was measured bed-by-bed at the centimeter scale through the exposure (Fig. 2\n). This and other measured lithostratigraphic sections in the region are presented and discussed as part of a regional sedimentology study by Lehrmann et al. (2019).\n\n\n3.2\nStructural characterization\nStructural characterization started with preparation of a full outcrop photomosaic of the exposure. This photomosaic served as the basis for field mapping of key stratigraphic horizons and faults through the outcrop and for locating other data including bedding and fracture measurements, vein samples for fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analysis, and bed-perpendicular vein scanline surveys. No tectonic or compactional stylolites were observed in the exposure. During field work, we recognized that the thickness and distribution of bed-parallel veins appeared to vary through the exposure, and that bed-parallel veins appeared to be best developed (thickest and highest frequency) within the dominant anticline in the exposure. To explore this apparent relationship further, we conducted bed-perpendicular vein surveys at five locations across the anticline structure. Vein composition, total vein thickness by vein type (calcite or gypsum), combined vein thickness, total rock thickness, and total vein intensity (number of veins per length of bed-perpendicular vein survey) were recorded at each survey location. Two of these surveys were located in the synclinal hinges bounding the anticline, two were conducted in the limbs of the anticline, and one survey was conducted in the anticline crest. For consistency, each survey was conducted perpendicular to bedding through the same representative mudrock and chalk interval that was accessible across the structure (Fig. 3\n).\nGround-based laser scan data and digital photographs of the study site were collected and used to generate a georeferenced, photorealistic digital outcrop of the 50-m-wavelength gentle anticline and bounding synclines. This photogrammetric digital outcrop was used for mapping horizons across the structure, and for capturing bed-by-bed structural geometries across the anticline and bounding synclines. 3D polyline interpretations were used for cross section construction and analysis by projecting 3D digital outcrop interpretations onto a plane oriented normal to the fold axis in Move 2019.1\u2122 (Petroleum Experts).\n\n\n3.3\nFluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analysis\nFluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analyses were performed on vein samples in order to constrain the fluid history of calcite.\n\n3.3.1\nMicrothermometry and fluid inclusion UV fluorescence\nFluid inclusion microthermometry (homogenization temperatures of two-phase inclusions and ice melting temperatures of aqueous inclusions) was used to constrain vein formation temperatures. Results can provide the basis for estimating depth of vein formation from two-phase inclusions, and estimating salinity of aqueous fluid inclusions (e.g., Parris et al., 2003; Hanks et al., 2006; Becker et al., 2010; Evans 2010; Evans and Fischer, 2012; Evans et al., 2012, 2014; Ferrill et al., 2017a, 2020a). Fluid inclusion fluorescence was used to identify liquid hydrocarbon inclusions, and to compare trapped fluids between samples to distinguish trapping events. This method has been used extensively to characterize liquid hydrocarbon inclusions (e.g., Bourdet and Eadington, 2012; Bourdet et al., 2012, 2014; Evans et al., 2014; Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017a, 2020a; Volk and George, 2019). Hydrocarbon inclusion fluorescence color has been linked to the API gravity of the trapped fluids (e.g., Burruss et al., 1983, 1985; McLimans, 1987; Burruss, 1991; Lisk et al., 1996; Lisk and Eadington, 1994; Parnell et al., 1998), but fluorescence color can be affected by a variety of factors including biodegradation, water-washing, fluid mixing, and migration fractionation (George et al., 2001). Sample collection, preparation and fluid inclusion microthermometric procedures used in this study are the same as those summarized in Ferrill et al. (2020a).\n\n\n3.3.2\nStable isotope analysis\nTo determine geochemical relationships between veins and evaluate the source of mineralizing fluids (e.g., Evans et al., 2012, 2014; Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017a, 2020a), oxygen and carbon isotope analyses were performed on samples of calcite fracture cements and their associated host rocks, and sulfur isotopic analyses were performed on gypsum veins. Oxygen and carbon stable isotopic analyses of calcite veins and carbonate-rich host rocks were carried out by Yale University Earth System Center for Stable Isotopic Studies on a Thermo MAT 254 Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer equipped with a KIEL IV Carbonate Device. Mineral samples were reacted at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min in 104% phosphoric acid. Results are reported on the Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPDB) scale by correcting sample data with Yale-in-house carbonate reference materials PX and MERC. Analytical precision (1 sigma) of Quality Control reference carbonate YM (n\u00a0=\u00a014) is 0.03\u2030 for \u03b413C and 0.04\u2030 for \u03b4 18O. Sulfur isotopic samples were analyzed using a Costech elemental analyzer (ECS 4010) connected to a Thermo DeltaPlus Advantage Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. The instrumentation setup utilized a quartz buffer column to correct for isotopic affects from the oxygen in the SO2 molecules (Fry et al., 2002). For each sample, four analytical runs were performed, and the results presented as an average.\nBy integrating the homogenization temperature data from two-phase aqueous inclusions (ThA) and oxygen isotopic data, the oxygen isotopic composition of the fluid that precipitated the vein minerals may be determined, thereby providing information on whether the precipitating fluids were meteoric or formation water. The oxygen isotopic composition of calcite depends on the isotopic composition of the fluid from which it precipitates and the isotopic fractionation between the fluid and the solid. If we assume precipitation in equilibrium with the fluids, the fractionation will depend upon the temperature. If the temperature of the fluid is known from the fluid inclusions, the isotopic composition of the fluid can be calculated using the equation of Friedman and O'Neil (1977) for calcite-water fractionation.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nLithostratigraphy\nThe lithostratigraphic measured section for the Langtry exposure includes 19.1\u00a0m of interbedded mudrock, limestone, and volcanic ash, including the top of Buda Limestone (\u22120.1 to 0.0\u00a0m in section) and 19\u00a0m of overlying Boquillas Formation (Fig. 2). Facies of the Boquillas Formation (and equivalent Eagle Ford Formation) can be assigned to (i) a hydrodynamically recycled association and (ii) a pelagic association (Lehrmann et al., 2019). The hydrodynamically recycled association includes heterolithic packstone\u2013grainstone, intraclastic grainstone conglomerate, and calcareous mudrock with sharp bed contacts, scours, ripple cross-lamination, and hummocky cross-stratification that indicate recycling of sediments by storm waves and bottom currents above storm wave base. In contrast the pelagic association consists of continuous lime packstone to grainstone and chalk beds with intercalated calcareous mudrock with gradational contacts and planar lamination indicating dominant deposition below storm wave base.\nThe lower 6.5\u00a0m of Boquillas Formation in the Langtry section is dominantly composed of highly lenticular limestone (grainstone and packstone) beds with abundant ripple cross lamination and hummocky cross stratification, representative of the hydrodynamically recycled association. A slumped interval with monomict breccia is present in this basal portion of lower Eagle Ford at the Langtry section, including cobble to boulder size clasts composed of pelagic lime packstone\u2013grainstone like the underlying beds. Clasts within this interval are contorted by soft-sediment deformation represented by folding and thickness changes without brittle deformation, indicating that they were unlithified (or only partially lithified) prior to detachment and slumping from the underlying layers and incorporation into debris flows (Lehrmann et al., 2019).\nThe upper portion of the section from 6.5\u00a0m to 19.0\u00a0m contrasts sharply with the lower portion by having a much greater proportion of calcareous mudrock (86% by thickness) and by having highly continuous, planar-bedded pelagic limestone beds characteristic of the pelagic association. Throughout the exposure, the Boquillas Formation contains numerous thin volcanic ash beds that are typically only a few centimeters or decimeters thick (marked with \u201cv\u201d symbols in Fig. 2). In addition to the thin ash beds, the Langtry exposure contains a distinctive 16-cm-thick volcanic tuff at stratigraphic height of 2.3\u00a0m (Fig. 2), which is widespread and can be recognized in several other roadcuts along Highway 90.\n\n\n4.2\nFolds and faults\nFolds at the site include broad gentle folds (interlimb angles 180-120\u00b0; Ramsay, 1967) with wavelengths on the scale of tens of meters and gentle limb dips, as well as narrow kink-band style folds. These kink-band style folds have widths of 1\u20135\u00a0m, represented by planar, moderately to steeply dipping beds between sub-parallel anticlinal and synclinal axial surfaces (1\u20135\u00a0m apart). The most prominent fold in the exposure is a broad gentle anticline with an interlimb angle of 146\u00b0 wavelength of 50\u00a0m, limb dips of 11\u00b0 and 23\u00b0 on east and west limbs respectively, and a fold axis trend\/plunge of 162\u00b0\/01\u00b0 (Fig. 3).\nFaults are relatively rare in the exposure. The largest fault in the exposure, which is nearly perpendicular to layering (Fig. 3a), has a strike\/dip of 015\u00b0\/87\u00b0 and reverse offset of 4\u00a0m. Concentrations of minor reverse and normal faults (with displacements on the order of centimeters) are present in the footwall of the 4-m-displacement reverse fault, and are associated with kink-band style folds.\n\n\n4.3\nVein geometry and cross-cutting relationships\nVeins in the exposure include sets that are (i) parallel to bedding, and (ii) at a moderate to high angle to bedding (Fig. 4\n). Bed-parallel veins include fibrous (selenite) gypsum with vertical or bed-perpendicular fibers (e.g., Fig. 4a and b), and blocky calcite veins (Fig. 4b). The overwhelming majority of bed-parallel veins are filled with fibrous gypsum, although two nearly continuous, blocky calcite veins are traceable across the entire anticline (Fig. 3a and b). Individual gypsum veins range in thickness up to 6\u00a0cm thick (Fig. 4a), and have lateral extents of tens of meters. In one mudstone interval, an en-echelon array is distributed for several meters laterally, suggesting an element of distributed shear during vertical extension (Fig. 4e). In addition, there are a few cases where short gypsum veins occur in en-echelon arrays where vein extension steps across bedding laminae, transferring vertical extension from one level to another vertically separated level (Fig. 4f, g, h). High-angle-to-bedding veins are predominantly filled with white blocky calcite, occasionally with green or brown blocky calcite, and rarely with gypsum. Local ptygmatic-fold structure observed in white-brown high-angle calcite veins is consistent with compaction in a normal faulting stress regime after vein formation, and conjugate high-angle calcite veins are also consistent with a normal faulting stress regime. Veins that are at a high-angle-to-bedding primarily strike NE-SW (Fig. 3a). Cross-cutting and abutting relationships indicate that high-angle calcite veins are typically cut by, but occasionally abutted by, bed-parallel gypsum veins, indicating early formation of the high-angle veins (Fig. 4c). Less commonly, high-angle-to-bedding calcite veins cut the bed-parallel veins (Fig. 4d) indicating high-angle vein formation after bed-parallel veins.\n\n\n4.4\nVein surveys\nAs noted earlier, bed-parallel veins are best developed in the broad anticline (Fig. 3a). Five bed-perpendicular veins surveys were performed across the anticline to document and quantify the occurrence, intensity, thickness, and strain represented by veins that are parallel (or at a low angle) to bedding (Fig. 3b). For consistency, each survey was conducted perpendicular to bedding from an upper marker bed (stratigraphic height \u223c13.1\u00a0m in the measured section) downward for at least 1.5\u00a0m through a mudrock package and underlying limestone to the top of the next lower mudrock interval at a stratigraphic height of \u223c11.6\u00a0m. These surveys document the thickness (i.e., mechanical aperture; Marrett, 1996; Ortega et al., 2006; Hooker et al., 2013) and mineralogy (calcite versus gypsum) of veins, and the thickness of host rock between veins along the bed-perpendicular survey lines (Table 1\n). From these measurements, (i) fracture intensity was calculated by dividing the number of veins by the summed host-rock thickness between veins (i.e., the initial thickness prior to vein extension), and (ii) percent vein extension was calculated by dividing summed vein thickness by summed host-rock thickness between veins (initial thickness), multiplied by 100.\nIntensity of all bed-parallel veins (measured along bed-perpendicular scanlines) shows close correspondence to structural position across the fold (Table 1; Fig. 5\na). Fracture intensities of 1.8 and 1.4 per m (represented entirely by calcite veins) were measured in the syncline hinges on the east and west sides of the anticline, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, much higher fracture intensities of 18.4, 21.8, and 9.9 per m (dominated by gypsum veins) were measured in the east limb, crest, and west limb of the anticline, respectively.\nGreatest magnitudes of bed-perpendicular extension were measured within the anticline, with 13.5% in the east limb, 11.8% in the crest, and 6.5% in the west limb (Fig. 5b). The majority of measured extension is accommodated by gypsum veins at these survey locations \u2013 13.0, 11.4, and 5.9% in the east limb, crest, and west limb, respectively (Fig. 5b). Bed-perpendicular extension due to calcite vein formation is 0.5, 0.4, and 0.7% in the east limb, crest, and west limb, respectively. The synclinal hinges to the east and west have 3.8 and 1.0% bed normal extension that is accommodated entirely by calcite vein formation, with no gypsum veins observed at these survey stations.\nCollectively, both the intensity of bed-parallel veins and their associated strain indicate a clear structural association of bed-parallel gypsum veins with the anticlinal fold. These observations are consistent with bed-parallel vein formation during folding.\n\n\n4.5\nCross-section construction and analysis\nCross section analysis of the fold was carried out to assess whether the relationship between structural position and bed-perpendicular extension represented by bed-parallel veins is present throughout the anticline, including higher in the section that was not safely accessible via extension ladder. 3D polyline interpretations of seven prominent horizons identified in the georeferenced digital outcrop (Fig. 6\na; see https:\/\/bit.ly\/3egiGrO for 3D visualization of the digital outcrop) were projected onto a cross section plane to construct a down-plunge view of the anticline. In order to quantify the location and magnitude of deviations from constant bed thickness throughout the cross section, and model vein-associated thickness changes across the structure, 2D bed construction was performed by using the constant-bed-thickness technique in Move 2019.1\u2122, with constructed bed geometries provided by projected polyline interpretations (Fig. 6b). For these prominent horizons, measured stratigraphic thicknesses at the eastern edge of the anticline were used as template thicknesses to construct a theoretical base of bed interval that would preserve layer thickness. The deviation between these constructed constant thickness beds and the observed beds permits visualization of the magnitude and distribution of bed thickening within each interval.\nResults from constant-thickness bed construction through the anticline show a systematic pattern of increased separation between constructed beds and greater total thicknesses towards the center of the fold structure (Fig. 6b). Bed-perpendicular distance measurements between projected polylines in cross section view (Fig. 6b) record bulk thickening of strata towards the crest of the anticline, from 7.7\u00a0m at the eastern edge of the structure, to 8.4\u00a0m at its crest. If increased stratal thicknesses towards the crest of the anticline are entirely accounted for by bed-perpendicular extension and associated vein formation (Fig. 6c), cross section measurements suggest total vertical extension of approximately 12% in the crest of the structure. This value is in general agreement with vein survey measurements (Table 1) from the lower part of the outcrop (Fig. 6a), suggesting that similar amounts of bed-perpendicular extension occurred through the exposed succession at the anticline crest. Close agreement between digitally constructed thickness changes across the structure and measured vein-related extension suggests that all or nearly all fold-related thickening and fold amplification within the anticline can be attributed to vein formation, rather than to ductile thickening of stratigraphic units. Estimated bulk thicknesses and extents of veins between interpreted stratigraphic horizons are provided graphically in Fig. 6c.\nExcess area and predicted depth to detachment analysis (Epard and Groshong, 1993; Groshong, 2015) in cross section view (Fig. 6d) suggest that the detachment level for the anticline lies approximately 11\u00a0m below the lowest continuously exposed stratigraphic horizon in the anticline (Fig. 6d). This horizon has a stratigraphic height of ca. 11.6\u00a0m above the top of the Buda Limestone (Fig. 2), which suggests that the detachment level for the Langtry anticline is along the top of the Buda Limestone. A high R2 value (0.99; Fig. 6e) for excess area vs. depth to reference level measurements suggest that the trend for these data is best approximated by a straight line fit and linear regression. As noted by Epard and Groshong (1993), a straight line in excess area vs. depth to reference level space records detachment folding, whereas thrust-fault-related folds (Epard and Groshong, 1993) or detachment folds with multiple detachments (Gonzalez-Mieres and Suppe, 2006) show abrupt changes in slope. We therefore interpret the Langtry anticline as a detachment fold with no intermediate detachments within the exposed structure.\n\n\n4.6\nVein fluid inclusions and stable isotope geochemistry\nVeins and associated host rock samples were collected from five locations in the anticline at the Langtry fold exposure, including blocky calcite and fibrous gypsum fills (Fig. 7\n). The samples include the following:\n\n(i)\nBed-parallel green blocky calcite vein (1\u00a0cm thick) overlain by white fibrous gypsum vein (1\u00a0cm thick) on the west limb of the anticline (bedding and vein orientation\u00a0=\u00a0180\u00b0\/10\u00b0) \u2013 Sample SN1149-040,\n\n\n(ii)\nSteeply dipping (035\u00b0\/67\u00b0) brown and white blocky calcite vein on east limb of anticline (bedding orientation\u00a0=\u00a0005\u00b0\/07\u00b0) \u2013 Sample SN1149-041,\n\n\n(iii)\nSteeply dipping (036\u00b0\/84\u00b0) green blocky calcite vein with euhedral crystal termination into vuggy porosity along vein centerline. Sampled vein is part of en echelon vein array on east limb of anticline (bedding orientation\u00a0=\u00a0005\u00b0\/07\u00b0) \u2013 Sample SN1149-042,\n\n\n(iv)\nBed-parallel (047\u00b0\/10\u00b0) clear to white fibrous gypsum vein, 0.5\u20134\u00a0cm thick \u2013 Sample 1149\u2013043,\n\n\n(v)\nBed-parallel (023\u00b0\/09\u00b0) clear to white fibrous gypsum vein, 4\u20136.5\u00a0cm thick \u2013 Sample 1149\u2013044.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.1\nFluid inclusion results\nAll calcite samples contain dark brown to black single-phase inclusions that are interpreted to be degraded hydrocarbons or bitumen (Table 2\n). These inclusions generally do not fluoresce under ultraviolet (UV) light, indicating that they have lost their aromatic components (Alpern et al., 1993). Because they lack vapor bubbles, these inclusions are not suitable for microthermometric analysis. Colorless to brown single-phase liquid hydrocarbon inclusions are also present in the samples, and these exhibit a wide range of UV fluorescence colors. Colorless single-phase inclusions that do not fluoresce are interpreted to be aqueous (saline to fresh water). Aqueous inclusions that lack a vapor bubble are common regionally in the Boquillas Formation (and equivalent Eagle Ford; Ferrill et al., 2014b; 2017a) and overlying Austin Chalk (Ferrill et al., 2020a) and indicate the fluids were trapped at relatively low temperatures and pressures, and that there was not enough energy to nucleate a vapor bubble upon cooling and are hence in a metastable state (Roedder, 1984; Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The origin of these inclusions is extremely difficult to determine due to low number and dispersal among other inclusions.\nTwo adjacent high-angle-to-bedding veins in the Boquillas Formation (1149\u2013041 and 1149\u2013042; Fig. 7e and f) have multiple stages of blocky and crack-seal calcite mineralization (Ramsay, 1980; Bons et al., 2012), with one individual vein having up to 100 individual opening events (Fig. 7e). The \u2018brown-white\u2019 vein (1149\u2013041) contains primarily hydrocarbon inclusions, while the \u2018green calcite\u2019 vein (1149\u2013042) contains primarily aqueous inclusions.\nOnly one sample (SN1149-042) provided two-phase aqueous inclusions suitable for microthermometric analysis (Fig. 8\na). Upon heating, the two-phase aqueous inclusions homogenized to the liquid phase between 67.0 and 81.2\u00a0\u00b0C. Tm values are different for each assemblage, with one being 0.0\u00a0\u00b0C, the other \u22122.2\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating salinities of 0.0 and 3.6\u00a0wt % NaCl equivalent (Table 2, Fig. 8a). First ice melting (eutectic) was extremely difficult to observe due to the small size of the inclusions, but it is above\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u221220.8\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating NaCl-rich fluids (Roedder, 1984).\n\n\n4.6.2\nHydrocarbon inclusion UV fluorescence\nThis study site has a large variety of inclusion fluorescence colors compared with other sites sampled in the region (e.g., Ferrill et al., 2014b; 2017a; 2020a), with liquid hydrocarbon inclusions occurring in both calcite and gypsum veins (Fig. 8b). Calcite from bed-parallel vein sample SN1149-040 contains inclusions that fluoresce yellow-green whereas gypsum from that same sample contains inclusions that fluoresce pale blue. Similarly, liquid hydrocarbon inclusions in bed-parallel fibrous gypsum vein sample SN1149-044 also fluoresce pale blue. Steeply dipping vein SN1140-041 contains inclusions that fluoresce yellow-green to light blue, and a separate population that fluoresce orange (Fig. 8b). The fluorescence colors of liquid hydrocarbon inclusions in the calcite and gypsum veins indicate \u223c25\u201337\u00b0 API gravity oils, which suggests that the oils were derived from sources that range in maturity from early to peak maturity (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n4.6.3\nStable isotope analysis results\nStable isotope data from the bed-parallel and high-angle-to-bedding calcite veins show a very consistent pattern of veins being 3.5 to 4.0 per mil lower in \u03b418O than the host rocks (Fig. 8c). \u03b413C values are similar but slightly higher than the values from the host rocks. All vein isotopic values are significantly different from their associated host rocks (Table 2, Fig. 8c), indicating that this was an open fluid system during vein formation. Both the \u03b413C and \u03b418O values of the host rock compositions do not correspond to values expected for Late Cretaceous carbonates (Fig. 8c; Veizer et al., 1999) suggesting whole rock alteration since the Cretaceous. The three gypsum veins analyzed have \u03b434S values that are low, \u22127.1 to \u22120.9 (Table 2).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nBed-parallel opening-mode veins and fold amplification\nHorizontal and subhorizontal bed-parallel opening-mode veins accommodate vertical extension, and reflect a vertical minimum principal compressive stress and a thrust faulting stress regime. In the Langtry fold exposure, bed-parallel blocky calcite veins in the surveyed interval are present across the structure with no major change in vein thickness or number of veins, and no clear relationship between structural position and the occurrence of bed-parallel blocky calcite veins. We therefore interpret the bed-parallel blocky calcite veins at the study site as having formed prior to the bed-parallel fibrous gypsum veins. The positive correlation between intensity of, and vertical extension by, gypsum veins across the anticline indicates that vein formation contributed strongly to fold amplification. Cross-section construction and analysis results show a close match between cross-section-based estimation of thickening of the survey interval and corresponding outcrop vein survey data across the anticline structure. Furthermore, cross-section analysis higher in the fold, above survey locations, shows similar thickness increases in the upper part of the structure, and systematic vein-related thickening and associated amplification of the Langtry anticline (Fig. 6d). The bed-parallel fibrous gypsum veins in the Langtry fold exposure are kinematically associated with folding, bed-perpendicular dilation, and fold amplification (Fig. 9\n), but do not reflect a flexural slip mechanism. These structures are kinematically more akin to saddle reef veins, although saddle reef veins are most commonly described in the hinges of tight folds (Ramsay and Huber, 1987). Excess area and depth to detachment analysis (Fig. 6d and e) suggest that the Langtry anticline is a detachment fold, with the position of the underlying detachment at the top of the Buda Limestone. This result, along with the lack of field evidence for significant flexural slip at the site, provide a compelling case for the Langtry anticline being a detachment fold, rather than a thrust-fault-related anticline.\n\n\n5.2\nBeef veins not associated with hydrocarbon generation\nFluid-inclusion trapping-temperature data, along with inferred timing and regional tectonic interpretation, suggest that vein formation occurred at depths on the order of 2\u20133\u00a0km. Source rock analysis from a sample of unoxidized organic-rich mudrock from this location (6.3\u00a0wt % total organic content; from stratigraphic height of 8.4\u00a0m above the top of the Buda Limestone) indicated that the rocks never reached hydrocarbon maturation conditions (Ferrill et al., 2020a). The fact that these source rocks did not reach hydrocarbon maturation conditions indicates that the trapped oil inclusions represent migrated oils rather than generated in situ.\nVein formation likely involved pore fluid overpressure that reduced the minimum principal effective stress into the tensile regime to generate tensile failure. As these strata never reached hydrocarbon maturation, this local overpressure cannot be explained by in situ hydrocarbon generation and expulsion. Elevated pore fluid pressure can be explained in low-permeability fine-grained strata like the Boquillas Formation by compaction without drainage, regardless of stress regime. Initial vertical compaction in the early normal faulting stress regime would have given way to horizontal contraction associated with Laramide shortening that likely continued to elevate pore pressure to the point of tensile failure in the thrust faulting stress regime (Ferrill et al., 2021). The presence of oil inclusions in both the calcite and gypsum veins indicates that both sets of vein were forming concurrently with hydrocarbon migration.\n\n\n5.3\nFluid history and conditions\nAs noted earlier, the vein calcite is between 4 and 5 per mil lower in \u03b418O and up to 3 per mil lower in \u03b413C than the host rock (Fig. 8c; open squares represent host rock values), suggesting an external fluid source. Hydrocarbon inclusions represent migrated oil, as discussed above. Collectively, fluid inclusion and stable isotope analysis of veins from the Langtry fold exposure of the Boquillas Formation provide evidence for an evolving fluid system that was generally open to external fluids as indicated by the wide variation in hydrocarbon inclusion fluorescence, and the mutual occurrence of both calcite and gypsum veins.\nCalculated fluid composition from sample SN1149-042 \u2013 the only one with ThA data \u2013 gives a \u03b418O value of \u22123.78\u2030 Vienna standard mean ocean water or V-SMOW, indicating a meteoric isotopic fluid composition (Fig. 8d). The oxygen equilibrium fluid values along with the low salinity of the aqueous inclusions confirm influx of meteoric water to at least the depth of the formation in this study. Aqueous fluids have a bimodal salinity distribution of 3.7 and 0.0\u00a0wt % equiv. The low salinities suggest an influx of meteoric groundwater which is supported by the oxygen isotopic equilibrium fluid value. The epifluorescence of the hydrocarbon inclusions in 1149\u2013041 suggest that a later fluid influx brought in more mature hydrocarbons.\n\nRose (2016) estimated the maximum depth of burial for the Boquillas Formation at Lozier Canyon (30\u00a0km WNW of our study area) to be 1.83\u20132.38\u00a0km, with a median of 2.24\u00a0km, and the West Comstock field site (29\u00a0km ESE of our study area) to be 1.34\u20131.68\u00a0km, with a median of 1.52\u00a0km. He estimated paleogeothermal gradients of 22\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 and 23\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 for the Lozier Canyon and Comstock West areas, respectively. Using the 23\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 geothermal gradient value, an average surface temperature of 20\u00a0\u00b0C (as described by Ferrill et al., 2020a), and the homogenization temperatures of 67\u201381\u00a0\u00b0C, estimated trapping depths at the Langtry fold site were 2.0\u20132.7\u00a0km. These depths are consistent with previously published estimates of Boquillas Formation maximum burial depth at Lozier Canyon and West Comstock (Rose, 2016). The results from the Langtry fold exposure are also generally consistent with estimates from fluid inclusion analysis of calcite vein cement in a normal fault in the Austin Chalk west of Langtry (10\u00a0km WNW of our study site), where Ferrill et al. (2020a) estimated overburden depths of 1.6\u20132.4\u00a0km at the time of faulting and vein formation and interpreted vein formation near maximum burial depth for these rocks.\n\n\n5.4\nStress switching from strike-slip regime to thrust-faulting regime and back again\nAs discussed in the results section, NE-SW striking early high-angle-to-bedding opening-mode veins are cut by bed-parallel opening-mode veins (Fig. 4c), and also cut by later high-angle-to-bedding opening-mode veins (Fig. 4d; also Fig. 8c in Ferrill et al., 2021). Opening-mode veins form perpendicular to the minimum principal compressive stress direction (Hancock, 1985), thus the vein orientations provide a record of this principal stress direction (Fig. 10\n). The switching from NW-SE-directed extension that produced steep NE-striking calcite veins to vertical extension represents a local switch from a normal-faulting or strike-slip-faulting stress regime to a thrust-faulting stress regime (Fig. 10). Compaction and local development of a ptygmatic structure of the white-brown calcite vein (Sample SN1149-041) is consistent with a normal-faulting stress regime, which these strata likely experienced prior to Laramide compression. The initial normal-faulting stress regime would have progressively altered to a strike-slip then a thrust faulting stress regime associated with NE-directed Laramide compression (Fig. 10; Ferrill et al., 2021). Repeated switching between near vertical and subhorizontal opening-mode fracturing suggests a stress regime dominated by a consistent maximum horizontal stress direction. Switching between (i) a strike-slip regime with a vertical intermediate principal compressive stress, and (ii) a thrust faulting stress regime with a vertical minimum principal stress, and a consistent NE-directed maximum principal stress direction, suggests that the magnitudes of the minimum and intermediate stress magnitudes were similar. With eventual post-Laramide tectonic relaxation, regional stress conditions eventually returned to a normal faulting stress regime (Fig. 10).\n\n\n5.5\nCalcite versus gypsum vein cement\nAs discussed in section 4, field observations show a complex relative timing relationship between gypsum and calcite veins that indicates a transitioning back and forth of preferred mineral precipitation. In limestones and calcareous mudrocks, calcite tends to be highly mobile and is typically the most common vein mineral (Gale et al., 2014). Occurrence of gypsum beef is most common in evaporites or lacustrine strata (see review by Cobbold et al., 2013; also see Meng et al., 2017), and is less common in marine mudrock like the Boquillas Formation. To switch from calcite (calcium carbonate) to gypsum (calcium sulfate) vein cementation requires a source of sulfur. Two explanations for gypsum vein material include (i) oxidation of pyrite by meteoric water to produce sulfuric acid, which dissolves calcium carbonate and results in gypsum precipitation (Tisato et al., 2012), and (ii) upwardly migrating H2S gas mixing with meteoric water to produce sulfuric acid, which dissolves calcium carbonate and results in gypsum precipitation (Hill, 1990).\nAs noted in section 4.3.3, we observed depleted \u03b434S values of \u22127.1 to \u22120.9 per mil in the three bed-parallel gypsum vein samples. Low \u03b434S values have been ascribed to the oxidation of sulfide formed by microbial reduction of sulfate (e.g., Kirkland, 1982; Pierre and Rouchy, 2020). Microbial reactions lead to enrichment of 34S in residual sulfate and to depletion of 34S in diagenetic sulfide (Thode et al., 1954; Jones and Starkey, 1957).\nSimilarly depleted \u03b434S values were reported from pyrite in Permian limestones of the Guadalupe Mountains (New Mexico). Even lower \u03b434S values have been measured in gypsum in cave deposits in the Guadalupe Mountains, which has been attributed to H2S migration out of the adjacent basin mixing with meteoric water to produce sulfuric acid (Hill, 1990; Jagnow et al., 2000). Hill (1990) used extremely depleted \u03b434S values as low as \u221225.6 from cave gypsum in the Guadalupe Mountains to argue that H2S sourced sulfur for gypsum formation, rather than pyrite. Therefore, an alternative origin of the gypsum is from H2S released from a deeper fluid reservoir.\nRegionally, the Buda Limestone and Edwards Group strata that underlie the Boquillas Formation are often found to have high concentrations of H2S gas (e.g., Ludwig et al., 1982; Davis et al., 2016), and faults have been interpreted as pathways for vertical migration of H2S gas (Ludwig et al., 1982; Goldhaber et al., 1983). Also, pyrite is common in the Boquillas Formation (Lock and Peschier, 2006; Lock et al., 2010), as well as the overlying Austin Chalk (Ferrill et al., 2020a), and underlying Buda Limestone (Valencia et al., 2021). As noted in section 4, the low salinities from aqueous inclusions and stable isotope data from the Langtry fold exposure indicate the presence of meteoric water during vein formation. With meteoric water circulation and presence of pyrite and H2S to source sulfur, resulting sulfuric acid production could have led to dissolution of calcium carbonate and precipitation of gypsum. Evidence of dissolution of limestone beds is observable in the exposure (e.g., Fig. 11\n), with dissolution often localized in steeper fold limbs and adjacent to faults in the exposure.\nIn the current study, we see evidence of meteoric water circulation to depths of 2\u20133\u00a0km, consistent with interpretation of deep circulation (to depths of 3\u20135\u00a0km) associated with contractional structures in the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico (Evans and Fischer, 2012). Switching between calcite and gypsum vein deposition could be driven by episodic influx of meteoric water, episodic influx of H2S gas, or opening and closing of fluid pathways, all of which are likely to be influenced by evolving development and connectivity of fault and fracture pathways during progressive deformation.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nBed-parallel opening-mode veins in the Langtry anticline developed during fold growth, amplifying the anticline. Vein survey data and cross-section analysis based on a georectified photogrammetric digital outcrop show thickening through the fold, with thickening represented in the outcrop by increased intensity and overall thickness of fibrous gypsum veins within the anticline. Field observations and cross section analysis suggest that the Langtry anticline is a detachment fold, with the position of the detachment at the stratigraphic contact between the Boquillas Formation and the underlying Buda Limestone. Our interpretations of beef vein formation during early fold amplification contrast with published examples of beef veins developed in horizontal strata, or late bed-parallel opening-mode veins formed during late-stage fold tightening (saddle reefs). Vein formation and folding were active at depths on the order of 2\u20133\u00a0km, based on analysis of two-phase aqueous fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures in strata that never reached conditions for hydrocarbon maturation based on source rock analysis.\nVein observations provide evidence for cross-cutting and abutting relationships that suggest that the stress regime switched multiple times: (i) NE-striking near-vertical veins are consistent with an early normal-faulting to strike-slip regime, (ii) horizontal to gently dipping bed-parallel opening-mode veins formed in a thrust-faulting stress regime (Laramide orogeny), and (iii) NE-striking near-vertical veins indicate return to strike-slip or normal-faulting stress regime later in the Laramide stress cycle.\nThe vein sequence at Langtry records transitions between calcite and gypsum mineralization. We interpret that gypsum mineralization indicates meteoric groundwater and a sulfur source, which may have been related to pyrite or H2S interaction with meteoric water to form sulfuric acid, dissolution of carbonate, and deposition of gypsum as an auxiliary mineral fill in opening-mode fractures. Switching between calcite and gypsum mineralization may have been driven by episodic influx of meteoric water or episodic influx of H2S gas, likely related to opening or closing of fault and fracture controlled fluid pathways during contractional folding.\n\n\nCredit authorship contribution statement\n\nDavid A.

Although seismic reflection data can be successfully used for fault network interpretation, a few studies document the architecture and seismic attributes of single faults (i.e., Cohen et al., 2006; Dutzer et al., 2010; Liao et al., 2019). Both seismic modelling and attribute-based interpretation have been employed to characterize the geometry of single fault zones, and assess their surrounding deformation (Botter et al., 2016; Alaei and Torabi, 2017; Cunningham et al., 2019) according to their seismic disturbance zone (Iacopini et al., 2016). In fact, although individual fractures are usually below seismic resolution, their cumulative effect could be detected as a distortion of the seismic signal (Chopra and Marfurt, 2009; Li et al., 2015), and their main orientation estimated by structural seismic attributes (Michelena et al., 2013; Mendez et al., 2020). Synthetic fault models and their associated seismic response show the potential for characterizing damage zones using seismic attributes (Botter et al., 2017). However, since the interpretation in the subsurface of sub-seismic structures across fault zones (i.e., subsidiary faults, fracture networks) are often affected by either a limited spatial distribution of 1D well data or low-resolution of seismic data, it is not clear how the seismic anomalies from these areas correlate with actual fracture distribution and petrophysical properties.\nFault damage zones, which commonly surround the fault cores, include thick volumes of fractured and faulted host rocks still preserving some of the original features such as bedding (Caine et al., 1996; Aydin, 2000; Gudmundsson et al., 2001; Sagy et al., 2001; Rotevatn et al., 2007). Within fault damage zones, many studies have documented common trends of both fracture density and intensity (Wilson et al., 2003; Faulkner et al., 2006, Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009; Savage and Brodsky, 2011; Johri et al., 2014; Ceccato et al., 2021). Although these trends have been verified in many outcrops, fracture parameters do not always scale proportionally with fault displacement (Anders and Wiltschko, 1994; Shipton and Cowie, 2003; Myers and Aydin, 2004; Mayolle et al., 2019; Mercuri et al., 2020). In this regard, several authors consider the role played by stress distribution along the evolving main slip surfaces on the localization of fault-related fracture clusters, assuming cohesive end zone models, different scales of mechanical unit thickness, and failure modes (Cowie and Scholz, 1992; Davatzes and Aydin, 2003; De Joussineau and Aydin, 2007a, 2007b; Camanni et al., 2021; Mayolle et al., 2021).\nThis work focuses on an integrated outcrop-based characterization and seismic modelling of a 100's m-thick footwall damage zone in low-porosity, platform carbonates. We investigate the complexity of the internal architecture of the fault zone from the structural, petrophysical, and seismic imaging points of view. The workflow is rooted on a field- and digital-based structural analysis. The studied fault, known as the Venere Fault (VF, Fig. 1\n), bounds eastward the intramontane Fucino Basin (Central Italy), and juxtaposes Lower Cretaceous platform carbonates on the footwall against Plio-Quaternary fluvio-lacustrine sediments on the hanging wall (Cavinato et al., 2002). By studying in detail the fractured and faulted carbonates exposed along the eastern and western walls of the active Santilli Quarry (Fig. 2\n), which are oriented approximately orthogonal to the main slip surface (MSS), we assess the inner structure of the Venere fault damage zone (VF-DZ).\nWe document fracture distribution across the VF-DZ and show a fracture intensity decrease from the MSS following a composite power-law equation. The outcomes of fracture analyses are then used to estimate the contribution of fractures to porosity; in this regard, different scenarios of fracture aperture\/length aspect ratio obtained from both field measurements and literature are considered (Olson, 2003; Schultz et al., 2008; Klimczak et al., 2010; Ghanbarian et al., 2019). Furthermore, in-situ permeability measurements are performed. As a result, a clear picture of petrophysical properties across the fault damage zone and poro-perm relations are obtained. Then, the resultant outcrop-scale 2D petrophysical model is further constrained by merging it with a virtual outcrop model of the fault zone, constructed using photogrammetry techniques. This base model has property zones (including acoustic properties) that obey the geometrical and spatial relationships observed in the outcrop. Finally, an enlarged version of the base model is used for seismic modelling and sensitivity analyses of both geological and geophysical parameters. Therefore, to evaluate the uncertainties in the seismic characterization and fluid-flow modelling of large faults in low-porosity carbonates, we integrate outcrop-based geological and petrophysical models of the VF-DZ with seismic modelling to generate seismic images of the fault zone.\n\n\n2\nStructural setting of the Fucino Basin\nThe Fucino Basin lies in the Peri-Adriatic outer portion of the central Apennines fold-and-thrust belt, Italy (Vezzani and Ghisetti, 1998; Vezzani et al., 2010). The central Apennines are characterized by primarily east-verging regional-scale thrusts, which formed during Late Miocene\u2013Pliocene compressional tectonics (Bigi et al., 1992; Ghisetti and Vezzani, 1999). Since Late Pliocene\u2013Early Pleistocene, the imbricated fold-and-thrust belt has been crosscut and dissected by NW-SE striking normal faults, which mainly dip SW, and to a lesser degree by E-W striking normal faults. The central Apennines were uplifted and exhumed from shallow crustal depths during Plio-Quaternary times (Ghisetti and Vezzani 1999, 2002). As testified by the 1915 Avezzano earthquake (Ms\u00a0=\u00a07.0), tectonic extension is still ongoing, with major seismic normal faults bounding the eastern side of the Fucino Basin (Boschi et al., 1997; Lanari et al., 2021 and references therein). Regarding the Avezzano earthquake, paleoseismological investigations document pure dip-slip extension (Michetti et al., 1996; Galadini and Galli, 1999), although minor right-lateral slip was determined in the Fucino Basin area by means of detailed fault scarps analysis (Piccardi et al., 1999). Overall, a ca. 300 m throw, and an average slip rate of 0.4\u20131.0\u00a0mm\/year were estimated for the Venere fault and the study area of the Fucino Basin (Cavinato et al., 2002; Roberts and Michetti, 2004; Faure Walker et al., 2010).\nIn this work, we focus on key outcrops located within the active Santilli Quarry. There, the footwall damage zone of the Venere Fault (VF-DZ) is nicely exposed allowing a full 3D characterization (Fig. 2). The platform carbonates consist of Lower Cretaceous limestones (Vezzani and Ghisetti, 1998), which mainly include carbonate boundstones with very low values of porosity and permeability (Agosta et al., 2007). After detailed analysis of fracture attitude, nature, distribution, abutting and crosscutting relations, Agosta and Aydin (2006) identified the fundamental fracture modes and main structural elements related to the processes of VF-DZ nucleation and growth. These authors documented three different orders of subsidiary faults according to their dimension and throw. The 1st order fault includes the main slip surface (MSS) and a cataclastic fault core, up to 1\u00a0m-thick, made up of grain- and matrix-supported cataclasites (Agosta and Aydin, 2006; Ferraro et al., 2018; Merico et al., 2020). These fault rocks were partially cemented by meteoric-derived fluids, which mainly infiltrated along the MSS (Ghisetti et al., 2001; Agosta and Kirschner, 2003; Agosta, 2008). The 2nd order faults, sub-parallel to the main fault, are characterized by length on the order of few to several hundred meters and include cm-thick fault cores made up of grain-supported cataclasites and\/or gouge. Due to outcrop limitation the amount of displacement is not observable and was estimated on the order of several tens of meters according to their geometrical parameters (Agosta and Aydin, 2006). The 3rd order faults show throws on the order of several centimeters and their internal structure is mainly made up of brecciated carbonate rocks and rarely millimeters to centimeters thick cataclasites. Previous works along the VF-DZ also analyzed the mineralogical, petrographic, textural, petrophysical, and ultrasonic properties of the fault rock assemblage (Agosta et al., 2007; Ferraro et al., 2019, 2020). Based on petrophysical analyses, these authors documented a near linear porosity-permeability relationship in the uncemented fault rocks. On the contrary, the cemented cataclasites that localize along the MSS show constant low values of permeability, like the host rock permeability, and varying values of porosity. Ferraro et al. (2020) interpreted this behavior as due to the presence of moldic porosity associated with the selective dissolution of survivor grains within the cemented cataclasites.\n\n\n3\nMethods\nWe use a workflow designed to investigate the VF zone through an integrated multidisciplinary approach. The inner structure of the VF-DZ is analyzed by coupling structural data acquired in the field and digital-based measurements on virtual models of the outcrop. The petrophysical properties of the fault-related fracture network (fracture porosity and fracture permeability) are obtained by integrating in-situ permeability measurements with results of fracture analysis. The resulting VF-DZ model includes the variations of the estimated values of fracture porosity and acoustic properties (P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, and bulk density). Finally, an enlarged version of this model is employed as input data to seismic modeling simulating different geological and geophysical scenarios, which provide useful information on the seismic character of the fault zone.\n\n3.1\nStructural analysis\nThe field structural analysis was conducted along two exposed walls, respectively labelled as eastern and western, cropping out in the Santilli Quarry (Fig. 2). Both eastern and western walls, sub orthogonal to the MSS, expose the VF footwall damage zone to its south-eastern tip and central portion, respectively.\n\n3.1.1\nCircular scan line analysis\nA total of 13 circular scan line measurements (CSL) are performed at specific sites (orange circles in Fig. 2) to assess the amount of fracture properties across the VF-DZ. At each site, we calculate the values of fracture density (P20), which is the number of fractures per area [m\u22122], fracture intensity (P21), which is the sum of fracture length per area [m\u22121], and mean fracture length (l), which is expressed in [m]. In this work, we refer to fracture length as fracture traces on the studied vertical walls. These parameters are estimated using the following equations (Mauldon et al., 2001):\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nP\n20\n\n=\n\nm\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\u00d7\n\nr\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nP\n21\n\n=\n\nn\n\n4\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nl\n=\n\nn\nm\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c0\nr\n\n2\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere n is the number of fracture intersections within a circular scan line, and m is the number of fracture terminations within the circular scan line. An optimal circle radius r of 0.1\u00a0m was chosen to avoid biases related to undersampling of fractures (Rohrbaugh et al., 2002), and multiple heterogeneity domains in a single survey. The required minimum number of 30 fracture terminations is always respected. Thus, the CSL size and the derived fracture properties (porosity and permeability) are assumed to be representative of single sampling stations.\nCSL analyses document the variation of both fracture density and intensity as a function of distance to both the main fault and the subsidiary faults, which respectively correspond to the 1st and 2nd order faults of Agosta and Aydin (2006). In small and isolated faults, the fracture density decreases away from the fault generally following a power law function (Savage and Brodsky, 2011). However, in more complex and large faults, the fracture density is generally characterized by more irregular distributions due to the presence of subsidiary faults and their related localized deformation. Savage and Brodsky (2011) proposed modelling the composite curve of fracture intensity across a fault zone characterized by subsidiary faults using a superposition of power-law functions. Following the same approach, we decomposed the estimated fracture intensity distribution into two main power-law functions, which correspond to the main and subsidiary faults, respectively. To obtain the coefficients of both power-law equations, an optimization approach was adopted by using a generalized reduced gradient nonlinear algorithm (Lasdon et al., 1974). This procedure consists of iteratively varying the constants of the power-law equations until the lowest sum of squared errors between the best-fit model and the data is obtained. Since the 3rd order faults are characterized by poorly developed, vertically discontinuous damage zones (Agosta and Aydin, 2006), their contribution is not incorporated in the fracture intensity decay model.\n\n\n3.1.2\nPhotogrammetry analysis\nPhotogrammetric surveys were performed along both eastern and western walls by means of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Then, by using the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique, we construct a virtual outcrop model (James and Robson, 2012). The aerial photographs were taken using the DJI Phantom 4 Pro UAV, which is equipped with a 20Mp onboard camera, and 1 inch image sensor. In the field, the UAV flew at distances between \u223c2 and 5\u00a0m from the studied walls. Each digital model was then built using \u223c200 overlapping photos. The general SfM processing procedure follows the methods described by Pitts et al. (2017) using the Agisoft Metashape software (Fig. 3\na). The output from the virtual outcrops consist of high-resolution surface meshes containing more than 30 million faces, and associated point clouds (up to 250 million points).\nThe main advantage of using virtual outcrop models is the ability to obtain additional information regarding the geometry of subsidiary structural elements in the footwall VF-DZ (Fig. 3 b-e). The point clouds were imported into the CloudCompare software for further interpretation, and to measure length, throw, dip direction and dip angle of subsidiary 2nd order faults (Fig. 3e). These data were obtained by using a semi-automatic fracture tracing method (Thiele et al., 2017). In addition, the high resolution orthomosaics (near 1.5 mm\/pix) from the virtual outcrop model were used for the construction of the VF-DZ base model. The eastern and western walls orthomosaics were merged into a single 2D section representing the footwall DZ. In this model, the 2nd order faults and the largest 3rd order faults cover a more representative area. Subsequently, the entire 2D geological model is populated with petrophysical and acoustic properties, as described in the following section.\n\n\n\n3.2\nPetrophysical and acoustic properties\n\n3.2.1\nFracture porosity\nThe amount of fracture porosity was calculated from the fracture density (P20) across the damage zone, using the following equation:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\nC\nS\nL\n\n\n=\n\nP\n20\n\n\u00d7\nl\n\u00d7\nE\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nl\n\n is the mean fracture length calculated from the CSL analysis, and \n\nE\n\n is the mechanical fracture aperture estimated from a linear relationship with the fracture length. Many studies focusing on fracture scaling relations, involving multiple fracture datasets, have demonstrated that the trend of this linear relationship (aperture\/length) varies between 0.01 and 0.001 (e.g., Olson, 2003; Schultz et al., 2008; Klimczak et al., 2010; Ghanbarian et al., 2019, and reference therein). This linear fracture aperture\/length relationship was further validated from field measurements (cf. Ch. 4.1). In this regard, we evaluated three scenarios of fracture porosity by varying the ratio \n\nE\n\/\nl\n\n:\n\ni.\n\u0424CSL1, which assumes \n\nE\n\/\nl\n\n\u00a0=\u00a00.01 and returns an average fracture aperture likely related to a relatively low confining pressure condition;\n\n\nii.\n\u0424CSL2, which assumes \n\nE\n\/\nl\n\n\u00a0=\u00a00.005 and represents the trend of fracture aperture\/length measured in the studied outcrop;\n\n\niii.\n\u0424CSL3, which assumes \n\nE\n\/\nl\n\n\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and results in very small average fracture aperture values, likely resembling the fracture aperture at greater, kilometer depths.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2\nFracture permeability\nIn-situ permeability measurements were carried out using a portable air permeameter, TinyPerm (Balsamo et al., 2010; Filomena et al., 2014; Tondi et al., 2016). To avoid biases due to surface irregularities and weathering, the sampling sites were cleaned and cleared out of detritus (Antonellini et al., 2014; Riegel et al., 2019). A maximum of 9 measurements were taken at each CSL station.\nTo obtain a reliable permeability value at each CSL station and avoid the use of fracture roughness correction factors (Zambrano et al., 2019 and reference therein), the hydraulic aperture, \n\ne\n\n, is first calculated using the equation for smooth parallel plates (Snow, 1969):\n\n(5)\n\n\ne\n=\n\n\n\n\nk\ni\n\n\u00d7\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nk\ni\n\n\n [m2] is the average permeability for each CSL station, derived from the permeability measurements. Then, the fracture permeability \n\n\nk\nf\n\n\n is calculated as follow:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\nk\nf\n\n=\n\n\nn\nL\n\n\n(\n\n\ne\n3\n\n12\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere n\/L is the linear fracture intensity [m\u22121], the number of fractures (\n\nn\n\n) per unit of length (\n\nL\n\n). To take advantage of our areal fracture survey approach, eq. (6) was modified to obtain the equivalent fracture permeability k\n\ne\n as follows:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\nk\ne\n\n=\n\n\nP\n21\n\n\n(\n\n\ne\n3\n\n12\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of fracture orientation was not considered for the estimation of the equivalent fracture permeability. However, k\n\ne\n was assumed to resemble the along-fault permeability component since the in-situ permeability measurements were taken in single fractures oriented sub-parallel to the MSS. According to the CSL analyses, the fractures are highly connected and therefore we assume that the fracture network is above the percolation threshold.\n\n\n3.2.3\nSeismic velocities and density\nTo perform the seismic modelling of the VF-DZ, the base model was populated with the P wave velocity Vp, S wave velocity Vs, and density, estimated from the field measurements. The Vp was derived from the porosity estimates by discriminating the effect of fracture and matrix porosity according to Kumar and Han (2005). These authors use a differential effective medium (DEM), which defines the contribution of interparticle pores (matrix) and crack-shaped pores (fractures) on P-wave velocity. To automate the selection of Vp values, we used a Matlab function powered by the curve fitting toolbox, which includes both matrix and fracture porosity components and delivers a Vp value in agreement with Kumar and Han (2005). For the sake of simplification of the implemented Vp-porosity relationship, the effect of fracture and matrix pore network anisotropy was not considered. For matrix porosity, we considered values \u223c0.8% as reported by Agosta et al. (2007). For the fracture porosity, we used the values estimated in section 3.2.1. The Vs values were obtained using a Vp\/Vs ratio of 1.9, which is typical for carbonates (Miller, 1992). The seismic velocities and density of the fault core were assigned using data from Agosta et al. (2007). Finally, the bulk density, \n\n\u03c1\n\n, was calculated assuming a water saturated porous medium, using the following equation:\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c1\n=\n\n\u03c1\nm\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03a6\n\n\n+\n\n\u03c1\nf\n\n\u03a6\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c1\nm\n\n\n is the matrix density, which is equivalent to the density of calcite (2.71\u00a0g\/cm3), \n\n\n\u03c1\nf\n\n\n is the density of the fluid (water, 1.0\u00a0g\/cm3), and \n\n\u03a6\n\n is the total porosity, including both fracture and matrix porosity.\n\n\n\n3.3\nSeismic modelling\nSeismic imaging simulations were used to evaluate the seismic expression of the VF-DZ and the inner structures considering different geological and geophysical scenarios. A based grid was built by combining information from the virtual outcrops and petrophysical and acoustic properties. Data obtained from the eastern and western walls were merged into a single 2D section representing the footwall VF-DZ (Fig. 11). The fracture domains (FDs) were extrapolated to a larger scale to include the surrounding geology of both the footwall and the hanging wall. This resulted in a more complete fault zone model, which is less biased by low contrasts of seismic impedance.\nThe synthetic seismic data were generated using the pre-stack depth migration (PSDM) simulator implemented in the SeisRoX\u2122 software. This simulator reproduces the effects of seismic imaging on the PSDM domain by acting as an image-processing method distorting an input reflectivity grid (Lecomte, 2008; Lecomte et al., 2015; Lecomte and Kaschwich, 2018). PSDM images can thus be rapidly simulated by spatial convolution with detailed 3D reflectivity models. This methodology was previously successfully employed to reproduce synthetic seismic images of faults and folds (Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Wood et al., 2015; Anell et al., 2016; Lecomte et al., 2016; Grippa et al., 2019; Wrona et al., 2020).\nThis method considers a spatial convolution operator called the Point-Spread Function (PSF), which ideally depends on the acquisition geometry, velocity model, and input wavelet, involving 3D angle-dependent illumination and resolution effects (Lecomte, 2008; Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016). The workflow and basic elements included in the 2D PSF-based convolution approach are shown in Fig. 4\n, whereas an extended description of this technique is given in Lecomte (2008). The main input to the PSDM simulator is an incident angle-dependent reflectivity model (Fig. 4a), which is derived from the acoustic properties of the model, i.e., density, Vp and Vs. In the absence of a given survey and background velocity model, as is the case for the present work, an angle of maximum illumination and a selected incident angle suffice to form a generic PSDM filter, which can be combined with a wavelet to add the frequency dependency (Fig. 4b). The angle of maximum illumination means that geological dips steeper than that angle will not be imaged. In the spatial domain, the PSF is the Fourier-equivalent of the PSDM filter in the wavenumber domain obtained by applying an inverse Fast Fourier transform (FFT\u22121) to the PSDM filter (Fig. 4c). The modelling can thus also be seen as a convolution in the spatial domain between the input reflectivity and the PSF. In the wavenumber domain, the PSDM filters are multiplied with the reflectivity grid after first converting the latter by Fast Fourier transform (FFT), and an inverse FFT (FFT\u22121) of the product yields the final simulated PSDM image (Fig. 4d).\n\n3.3.1\nGeological and geophysical parameters\nFor the simulations, we focus on understanding the seismic expression of the fault damage zone under different geological and geophysical parameters as summarized in Fig. 5\n. Most of the VF-DZ structures are at sub-seismic scales and would not be detected in industry seismic at km depths (\u223c20\u201340\u00a0Hz frequencies). To test the impact of a structure like the VF-DZ at such depths and with standard seismic frequencies, we enlarged five times the geological model. This procedure is reasonable since fault zones mostly have a fractal nature, which means that their dimension scales with fault displacement (Fossen and Gabrielsen, 1996; Faulkner et al., 2011; Torabi et al., 2020), whereas their fracture abundance variation is insensible to fault size (Scholz, 2019, and references therein). Scibek (2020) also highlights the occurrence of similar petrophysical properties in fault damage zones regardless of their dimension.\nSince the field data are limited to the footwall of the VF-DZ, we build three different geological models (GMs), which differ in terms of surrounding lithology above (footwall) and adjacent (hanging wall) to the outcrop model as follows:\n\ni.\nGM1 carbonates with 10% matrix porosity.\n\n\nii.\nGM2 carbonates with 5% matrix porosity.\n\n\niii.\nGM3 saturated flysch with constant acoustic properties: Vp\u00a0=\u00a02.5\u00a0km\/s, Vs\u00a0=\u00a00.8\u00a0km\/s, and density\u00a0=\u00a02.2\u00a0g\/cm3 (data from Patruno and Scisciani, 2021; Mancinelli et al., 2021).\n\n\n\nThese three models test the effect of different surrounding impedance contrasts on the seismic signature of the VF-DZ. In the GM1 and GM2 models, the VF-DZ is surrounded by the lithology observed in the footwall. In the GM3 model, however, the fault zone is surrounded by flysch of the Fucino Basin. For the three models, the petrophysical and acoustic properties of the carbonates are varied by considering three fracture aperture scenarios corresponding to 0.01, 0.005, and 0.001 times the mean fracture length of the fault zone as stated in section 3.2.1 (Fig. 5). To test the effect of these different geological parameters, the geophysical parameters are fixed, and they include a Ricker wavelet of 30\u00a0Hz dominant frequency, and a 60\u00b0 illumination angle. To complete the sensitivity analysis, geophysical parameters controlling the PSF are varied for the model GM2. Specifically, we test the effect of different illumination angles (45, 60 and 90\u00b0), and wavelet frequencies (20, 30 and 40Hz).\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nFracture properties\nThe VF-MSS (1st order fault) is laterally continuous throughout the study area (Fig. 2). The strike of this fault varies from S42E (southern edge of the Santilli Quarry) to S64E (northern edge), whereas its dip angle is\u00a0\u2248\u00a050\u00b0 SW. The well-developed slickenlines present on the fault planes show pitch angles forming clusters at ca. 90\u00b0 and ca. 105\u00b0 along the southern and northern edges of the quarry, respectively. The 100\u00a0m-thick footwall VF-DZ includes four 2nd order faults, which roughly strike NW-SE, and form high-angle synthetic structural elements with respect to the MSS (Figs. 2 and 3). The spacing between adjacent 2nd order faults increases away from the MSS. Hereafter, we document the detailed architecture of two walls orthogonal to the MSS labelled as eastern and western walls, respectively.\nThe eastern wall is crosscut by two 2nd order faults (Figs. 2 and 6\na). The 2nd order fault closer to the MSS strikes S55E, and dips 65\u00b0 SW, whereas the other one strikes S46E, and dip 85\u00b0 SW. The latter fault is associated with a conjugate splay oriented S54E\/64\u00b0 NE. The amount of displacement solved by these faults cannot be established. Both 2nd order faults include a few m-thick fault damage zones encompassing uncemented (poorly cemented in places) fault cores made up of 5\u201320\u00a0cm-thick cataclasites (Fig. 7\na and b). We document a total of 47 3rd order faults. Overall, they strike N80W to N30W, dip 50\u201380\u00b0 NE (Fig. 6c), and are hence antithetic to the MSS. Based upon the offset of the carbonate beds, the 3rd order faults are characterized by throw values ranging from 5 to 60\u00a0cm. These faults are made up of discontinuous pods of brecciated carbonates that localize along the slip surfaces (Fig. 7c). We note that the bedding attitude along the whole eastern wall varies from ca. S60E\/45\u00b0 SW, away from the MSS, to ca. S60E\/60\u00b0 SW close to it.\nThe western wall exposes the MSS, and it is crosscut by two 2nd order faults striking\u00a0\u2248\u00a0S50E, and dipping 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0SW (Fig. 6b). These 2nd order faults are therefore synthetic to the MSS. The amount of displacement solved by these faults cannot be established. Their inner structure is made up of 5\u201310\u00a0cm-thick cataclasites. The western wall is also crosscut by 39 3rd order faults, most of which are synthetic to the MSS fault. Altogether, these subsidiary faults show a wider range of attitudes with respect to those crosscutting the eastern wall. They strike S40W to S20E, and dip 40\u201380\u00b0 W (Fig. 6c). Regarding the amount of displacement, it is not possible to establish it due to the lack of evident stratigraphic markers. The inner structure of these faults includes 2 to 5\u00a0cm-thick uncemented fault core, mainly characterized by fragmented and comminuted carbonates. We note that the density of the 3rd order faults is not homogeneous within the western wall, showing an increment by a factor of ca. 2 approaching the MSS (from about 20\u00a0m-distance). The bedding attitude measured along the western wall is somehow constant at values of ca. N30W\/15\u00b0 NE.\nThe results of the CSL analyses are summarized in Table 1\n, and reported in Fig. 8\na and 8b. The computed values of fracture density (P20), fracture intensity (P21), and mean fracture length (l) are also shown as normalized values with respect to the largest ones (Fig. 8b). Linear fracture aperture\/length relations are documented for the two study outcrops of the footwall VF-DZ (Fig. 8c).\nAlthough it is difficult to distinguish in the field the extent of 2nd order fault damage zones from surrounding deformation, a further analysis of the fracture intensity (P21) shows that it decreases as function of distance (D) from the MSS and that it can be decomposed into two main trends, which are related to the 1st and 2nd order faults (Fig. 9\n). The optimal solution obtained by applying the minimum squares technique generates a modelled decay with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.07 (dashed black line in Fig. 9). The modelled decay of fracture intensity is represented by power-law functions (\n\n\nP\n21\n\n=\nc\n\u00d7\n\n\nd\n\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n\n), as reported in the literature (Savage and Brodsky, 2011). It consists of a main, broader decay with an exponent n\u00a0=\u00a00.5, a scaling factor c\u00a0=\u00a0700, and a distance D (dashed red line in Fig. 9), representative of the 1st order fault; and smaller, more localized decays with n\u00a0=\u00a00.52, c\u00a0=\u00a056, and distance to the subsidiary structure d\n\ni\n, representative of the 2nd order faults.\n\n\n4.2\nPetrophysical properties\nThe calculated fracture porosity (\u0424CSL) and the equivalent fracture permeability (k\n\ne\n) are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 10\n\n. In general, across the VF-DZ both fracture porosity and permeability show a decreasing trend away from the MSS, which is consistent with the reported fracture intensity decay. The fracture permeability derived from field CSL measurements shows median values ranging from 1.1\u00a0E\u221212 to 5.8\u00a0E\u221215\u00a0m2. The range of variability at each CSL station is between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, for the first and third quartile values of the permeability distribution, respectively (Fig. 10). Generally, the calculated values of permeability are in agreement with the values of fracture porosity documented for the fracture domains. However, close to the 2nd order faults (CSL #2, #7, #12), the calculated values of fracture permeability are 3 orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding rock, regardless of the estimated high fracture porosity values (Fig. 10).\nThe \u0424CSL values [%] are strongly dependent on the adopted fracture aspect ratio (E\/l). The high-end member (\u0424CSL1), E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.01, gives an average mechanical aperture, E, of 0.2\u00a0mm with \u0424CSL values ranging from 2.2 to 4.9%. On the other hand, the low-end member (\u0424CSL3), E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.001, gives an average mechanical aperture, E, of 0.02\u00a0mm with \u0424CSL values not exceeding 1%. The combined analysis of fracture density\/intensity and fracture porosity is therefore key to assess the three main fracture domains (FD, Fig. 8b). We also compare the values obtained for these domains with those after the most conservative case, E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.005, which is the most representative scenario for the studied outcrop, in light of the measured fracture aperture\/length trends (Fig. 8c). The first fracture domain (\u0424f\u00a0>\u00a02.1%) corresponds to fragmented carbonates, which are present close to the MSS (<20\u00a0m from the MSS, western wall of the quarry). The second domain is highly fractured (\u0424f\u00a0=\u00a01.6\u20132.20%), and corresponds to rock volumes located 20\u201340\u00a0m away from the MSS. The third domain is moderately fractured (\u0424f\u00a0=\u00a01.1\u20131.6%) and is present >40\u00a0m away from the MSS and 5-to-20\u00a0m away from the 2nd order faults. This domain includes all meso-scale fault-related fractures and those associated with the 3rd order faults (Fig. 8b). Within the most deformed zones (i.e., in proximity of the MSS or 2nd order faults), the fracture network is characterized by a higher fracture intensity but a smaller fracture dimension (i.e., length and aperture). Furthermore, the fracture aspect ratio in these areas can be smaller than in the less deformed carbonate rocks, as demonstrated by the lower fracture aperture-length trend of the western wall with respect to the eastern wall (Fig. 8c).\n\n\n4.3\nPetrophysical and seismic velocity model\nSince the amount of fracture porosity is modelled as a function of distance from 1st and 2nd order faults (Fig. 11), we include the three FDs (fragmented, highly fractured, and moderately fractured carbonates) in the 2D base model. In addition, far (\u2248130\u00a0m) from the MSS, the modelled fracture intensity and porosity are lower than the values reported from the CSL analyses within the VF-DZ (Figs. 8 and 9). Therefore, we added a new fracture domain called weakly fractured carbonates, which is associated with the host rock of the VF zone. In this domain, the values of fracture intensity are almost stable (coefficient of variation <0.5%) and the fracture porosity (for E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.005) is \u223c0.7%.\nBoth the calculated density and seismic velocity should mimic the values of fracture porosity because they are derived from this parameter. However, as explained in section 3.2.3, the seismic velocities have a more complex relationship with fracture porosity (Kumar and Han, 2005). The calculated porosity, density, P-wave velocity, and the resultant reflectivity model of the GM2 fault zone model is shown in Fig. 11, and in tabulated format in Table 2\n.\n\n\n4.4\nSeismic models\nThe geological and geophysical parameters adopted for the seismic modelling of the VF zone are summarized in section 3.3.1 (Fig. 5). The base model including the FDs distribution, fracture porosity and acoustic properties (Fig. 11a\u2013c) was tested, and a sensitivity analysis was applied to evaluate the (PSDM) seismic signature of the VF-DZ.\n\n4.4.1\nImpact of geological parameters\nTo perform a sensitivity analysis based on different geological parameters, we use the 3 different geological models (GM1-3), which differ from each other in terms of surrounding lithologies (cf. Section 3.3.1, and Fig. 5). In general, we observe that only the FDs characterized by a higher fracture porosity variation (fragmented carbonates, and highly fractured carbonates) are visible in the seismic image due to their higher impedance contrasts (Figs. 11 and 12\n). It is also clear that the area corresponding to the 2nd order fault farther from the MSS is not very visible. The internal architecture of the VF-DZ is imaged in more detail in model GM2 (Fig. 12b). Differently, in model GM1, the higher matrix porosity of the surrounding rocks provides a stronger reflector. Its seismic response masks the weaker reflection related to the reflector near the MSS, which corresponds to the interface between the fragmented and highly fractured carbonates in the vicinity of the 2nd order fault closest to the MSS (Fig. 12a). This effect is more pronounced in model GM3 (Fig. 12c) due to an even higher impedance contrast because of the overlying flysch.\nThe fracture mechanical aperture, which is controlled by the fracture aspect ratio E\/l, significantly affects the imaging of the FDs within the VF-DZ. In the first scenario (high values of fracture aperture, E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.01), the details of the internal architecture of the damage zone are highlighted by high amplitude reflectors that are stronger in the GM2 model, and weaker in the GM1 and GM3 models (Fig. 12a, b, and c). In the second scenario (intermediate values of fracture aperture, E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.005), the FDs\u2019 location and geometry are still recognizable from lower amplitude reflectors in all three GM models, although some details are lost (Fig. 12d, e, and f). Finally, in the third scenario (lowest fracture aperture, E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.001), the FDs are not observable in any of the GM models (Fig. 12g, h, and i).\n\n\n4.4.2\nEffect of geophysical parameters\nThe aim of this section is to investigate the seismic signature of the VF-DZ by varying the maximum angle of illumination for dominant wavelet frequencies of 20, 30 and 40\u00a0Hz. We include only the results for the GM2 model and E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.005. The maximum illumination angles applied in this study are 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0, which correspond to intermediate (standard), high, and perfect seismic illuminations with the latter being in practice not attainable. The VF-DZ shows a great variation in seismic signature as the maximum illumination angle varies (Fig. 13\n). As expected, at perfect illumination (90\u00b0) the seismic signature of the VF-DZ shows illumination of the FDs related to the 2nd order faults (Fig. 13c, f, and i). At high illumination angle (60\u00b0), some details of the VF-DZ inner architecture are lost due to the lack of illumination of structures steeper than 60\u00b0. However, the FDs are still detectable on the seismic image, and can be partially interpreted (Fig. 13b, e, and h). On the contrary, the seismic sections modelled with a 45\u00b0 maximum illumination angle do not show the MSS, and the FDs are only present as discontinuous\/vanishing reflectors and seismic disturbance zones from antithetic structures with lower dip angle (Fig. 13a, d, and g). The decreasing dominant wavelet frequency clearly impacts the seismic image. This is particularly evident in the lowest frequency case (20\u00a0Hz, Fig. 13g, h, and i), where most details of the VF-DZ are lost resulting in a blurred seismic image.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nFault damage zone architecture\nThe integration of observations and measurements on the outcrop and the virtual outcrop models allow us to obtain an accurate representation of the main structural complexity of the VF-DZ, specifically of both attitude and distribution of subsidiary faults. In agreement with Agosta and Aydin (2006), the MSS shows almost pure dip-slip kinematics, and minor right-lateral slip. The 2nd order faults are subparallel, and mainly synthetic to the MSS. Differently, the 3rd order faults show greater attitude variation, and cluster along the eastern wall close to the southern tip of the VF. Such a clustering is interpreted as due to along-strike kinematics variations associated with processes of lateral fault growth by segment linkage, as similarly documented for carbonate fault damage zones exposed in the northern edge of the Fucino Basin (Mercuri et al., 2020, and references therein).\nThe results of the CSL analyses are employed to calculate the main fracture parameters such as fracture density, P20, and intensity, P21. This procedure is an efficient tool for fracture distribution characterization in highly deformed carbonates and is relatively quicker than traditional time-consuming linear scanlines performed in carbonate fault damage zones (Panza et al., 2016, 2019; Zambrano et al., 2016; Giuffrida et al., 2019, 2020; Volatili et al., 2019).\nWe computed a composite power-law decay of fracture intensity from the MSS (cf. Fig. 9) within the VF-DZ. A similar composite fracture density decay has been documented for carbonate damage zones by Mayolle et al. (2019), where the effect of secondary faults is represented by the presence of secondary peaks in the fracture frequency decay function.\nAlthough it is not possible to discern the actual contribution on fracture distribution by the 2nd order faults to the 1st order fault and vice versa, our field-based statistical approach (Fig. 9) demonstrate that the subsidiary fault zones farther from the MSS have higher peaks of fracture intensity with respect to the main fracture distribution decreasing trend. This behavior is likely linked to fault growth processes limited by an already fracture saturated environment approaching the MSS, yielding an obliteration of subsidiary fault damage zones.\n\n\n5.2\nPetrophysical properties\nPrevious studies on permeability distribution in carbonate fault damage zones based on different methods such as discrete fracture network modelling (Panza et al., 2018; Volatili et al., 2019, Romano et al., 2020, Smeraglia et al., 2021), in-situ measurements (Antonellini et al., 2014, Tondi et al., 2016; Riegel et al., 2019), laboratory tests of plugs derived from hand specimens (Bauer et al., 2016; Trippetta et al., 2017), and drill core samples and slug\/injection tests (Westphal et al., 2004; Gabay et al., 2014) described a permeability range comprised between 10\u221216 and 10\u221211\u00a0m2. We show that the median values calculated in this work for fracture permeability vary from 10\u221215 to 10\u221212\u00a0m2 across the VF-DZ (cf. Fig. 10). These values lie within the range above, and also highlight that the decreasing trend of the petrophysical properties moving away from the MSS present some divergencies near the 2nd order faults. This divergence is also shown in the poro-perm cross plot (Fig. 14\n). There, we document a power-law best-fit line (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.7) of data gathered from CSL stations distant from 2nd order faults (blue dots in Fig. 14). We note that the aforementioned power-law poro-perm relation does not apply to data gathered in the vicinity of the 2nd order faults (orange squares in Fig. 14). We suggest two field-driven explanations for such behavior, causing a drastic reduction of fracture permeability independently of fracture porosity variation. First, within the most deformed zones (i.e., in proximity of the MSS and\/or 2nd order faults), the fracture network is characterized by higher fracture intensity values, smaller fracture dimensions (i.e., length and aperture), and lower aspect ratios (fracture aperture-length relations shown in Fig. 8c) with respect to the surrounding network. Second, fractures aside the most deformed zones can be partially healed by carbonate cements, as documented along the 2nd order faults by Agosta and Aydin (2006). These authors reported the occurrence of sporadic veins clustering in the surrounding of slip surfaces bounding narrow pods of cataclastic rocks. In siliciclastic sedimentary successions, Riegel et al. (2019) also documented the control exerted by interconnected fracture networks on the cementation processes within fault damage zones. However, we note that an uneven distribution of fracture healing is predicted for active fault zones (Mizoguchi and Ueta, 2013), such as the studied VF-DZ.\n\n\n5.3\nSeismic modelling\nSeveral studies document the benefit of using field-based geological models as input data for seismic modeling (i.e., Rabbel et al., 2018; Grippa et al., 2019; Wrona et al., 2020). This procedure helps unraveling the seismic response of complex stratigraphy and structural heterogeneities. Some works have used digital outcrop models for seismic modelling (Anell et al., 2016; Lubrano-Lavadera et al., 2019). In this contribution, the use of an integrated field- and digital-based model of the VF-DZ allows the investigation of the seismic signature of a complex fault architecture by considering various geological and geophysical parameters. In fact, despite the lack of model constraints such as well-log data, survey geometry, and background velocity, the versatility offered by the PSF-based convolution modelling technique allows us to perform a sensitivity analysis of the (PSDM) seismic signature of the VF zone (Figs. 12 and 13).\nAccording to the results, the first set of simulations, investigating the effect of geological parameters while keeping the same geophysical parameters (Fig. 12), shows a slight obliteration of the internal architecture of the VF-DZ by the masking effect of the strong and regular reflectors in the GM1 to GM3 models. This means that the surrounding lithology does not significantly affect the seismic imaging of the VF-DZ. Conversely, the fracture mechanical aperture seems to be a crucial parameter. In fact, the sensitivity analysis based on the fracture aspect ratio (E\/l) demonstrates that the fault architecture is not imaged in the low-end case (E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.001), thus suggesting that if fracture porosity is below 1%, due to very small average fracture aperture (few microns), their FDs would not give high enough impedance contrasts to be imaged on seismic. The latter fracture aspect ratio scenario is the most representative for km-depth structures affected by very high confining pressure (e.g., >50\u00a0MPa), returning fracture aperture values in the order of few microns, thus consistent with a well-known fracture aperture reduction due to overburden load (Nelson and Handin, 1977).\nThe second set of simulations investigating the effect of geophysical parameters (Fig. 13) while keeping the same geological parameters, i.e., the middle-member case GM2 and E\/l\u00a0=\u00a00.005 of Fig. 12, identify the 30\u00a0Hz dominant frequency as the lowest frequency required to image the internal architecture of the VF-DZ, without losing details depicting the FDs. However, since the model of the fault zone was enlarged five times to simulate reasonable dominant frequencies commonly observed in conventional seismic at km depth (i.e., 20, 30, and 40\u00a0Hz), this means that a much higher frequency typical of high-resolution seismic data (i.e., \u223c150\u00a0Hz) is required to image the fault zone in its actual size. In this regard, Faleide et al. (2021), comparing conventional and high-resolution seismic data, pointed out the need of coupling the latter with seismic modelling to reduce uncertainties related to seismic interpretation of fault zones. Similarly, the illumination angle, which in an actual seismic survey is determined by the background velocity model and a given survey geometry, shows how the steepest features (i.e., MSS and 2nd order faults) are barely imaged by illumination angles below 45\u00b0 (Fig. 13a, d, g). At standard or low illumination angles (and larger depths), the fault would only be detected by the vertical offset of gently dipping reflectors. Therefore, the left cases of Fig. 13, where the fault plane does not appear due to lack of illumination, would likely represent the outcomes of conventional seismic at km-depths. This suggest that the complex internal architecture of structures like the VF-DZ at km-depth would be mostly undetected by conventional seismic, although their presence and related petrophysical heterogeneity, as documented in this study, may affect fluid flow. However, the seismic signature of the VF-DZ will still be characterized by the occurrence of seismic disturbance zones related to the subsidiary structures. Through seismic modelling, Faleide (2021) reported the occurrence of similar disturbances of the seismic signal in a fault damage zone.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nWe presented a multidisciplinary integrated characterization of a seismic scale (throw\u00a0\u2248\u00a0300\u00a0m) normal fault zone, the Venere Fault (VF), which cuts across Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous platform carbonates and bounds the eastern side of the Fucino Basin (central Italy). The VF damage zone (VF-DZ) architecture was investigated from the structural, petrophysical, and seismic imaging points of view. By combining field- and digital-based structural analyses, the results highlight the profound control exerted by subsidiary faults on both fracture distribution and petrophysical properties. The resultant 2D model of the VF-DZ was then populated with elastic properties (i.e., Vp, Vs and density values) derived from the porosity of both the matrix and fracture components. This base model depicting subsidiary structures that impart heterogeneity to the fault zone, was the input to seismic modelling that allowed us to perform a sensitivity analysis according to various geological (surrounding lithology and fracture aperture) and geophysical parameters (wave frequency and illumination angle). To test the impact of a structure like the VF-DZ at km-depths and with standard seismic frequencies (\u223c20\u201340\u00a0Hz) the model was enlarged five times. The main outcomes of this work are the following:\n\n\u2022\nIn terms of deformation, fracture abundance distribution does not decrease regularly away from the main slip surface (MSS). In contrast, the fracture distribution is profoundly affected by the occurrence of subsidiary faults. In this regard, we documented a composite power-law decay of fracture intensity as a function of the distance from the MSS and the single secondary faults.\n\n\n\u2022\nRegarding petrophysical properties, both fracture porosity and permeability show a decreasing trend away from the MSS. However, they are also profoundly affected by subsidiary faults. In fact, the computed fracture porosity increases by a factor of 2\u20133, whereas permeability decreases down to 3 orders of magnitude near subsidiary faults.\n\n\n\u2022\nFrom seismic imaging, we can assess that the most relevant geological parameter affecting the seismic signature of the VF-DZ is fracture aperture. When this parameter yields fracture porosity values below 1%, the internal architecture of the damage zone is not visible on seismic. Higher impedance contrasts by different surrounding lithologies slightly conceal the reflectors close to the MSS, without drastically compromising the VF-DZ signal.\n\n\n\u2022\nHigh frequencies (\u223c150\u00a0Hz) are required to image the VF-DZ in its actual size. The same fault model enlarged five times, requires a minimum frequency of 30\u00a0Hz to be properly imaged. The illumination angle strongly influences the seismic image. In conventional seismic at km-depth (illumination angle \u226445\u00b0) the subsidiary structures within the VF-DZ are partially imaged as seismic disturbance zones but most of the details are lost.\n\n\n\nThe applied methodology is greatly adaptable to different geologic settings. Coupling petrophysical outcrop-based models with seismic modelling can improve the seismic interpretation and characterization of fault zones. In particular, the observed variations of fracture abundance along subsidiary structures in outcrop can be simulated on seismic images by using various geological and geophysical scenarios. This is of particular interest for reservoir characterization in carbonates, where the heterogeneity of fracture density\/intensity given by subsidiary faults or fracture corridors play a crucial role on the fluid storage and migration properties of large-scale fault zones.\n\n\nAuthor statement\n\nTiziano Volatili: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing \u2013 Original draft, Visualization.\n\nFabrizio Agosta: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing.\n\nNestor Cardozo: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing.\n\nMiller Zambrano: Methodology, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing.\n\nIsabelle Lecomte: Methodology, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing.\n\nEmanuele Tondi: Writing \u2013 Review & Editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition.\n\n","66":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFault-related folding at shallow crustal levels within fold\u2013thrust belts can be accompanied by fracture network development, and the genetic relationships between folding and related fracture systems in the elastico\u2013frictional regime have long been studied to gain insight into these relationships (Stearns, 1968; Ismat and Mitra, 2005a, b; Ismat and Benford, 2007; Stephenson et al., 2007; Beaudoin et al., 2012; Reif et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016; Basa et al., 2019). The spatiotemporal variations in fold-related fracture systems in such a deformation environment are attributed to various controls, including lithology (Watkins et al., 2015b, 2018), structural position (Jamison, 1997, 2016; Bellahsen et al., 2006), mechanical stratigraphy (Stephenson et al., 2007; Hayes and Hanks, 2008), fold curvature (Fischer and Wilkerson, 2000; Bergbauer and Pollard, 2004; Watkins et al., 2015b, 2018), and deformation mechanism (Tamara et al., 2015; Ali, 2017; Burberry et al., 2019). Fold-related fracture networks are common in fold\u2013thrust belts; hence, their role as an effective conduit for fluid migration is one of the primary concerns in various applications, including hydrocarbon exploration, carbon capture and storage, and aquifer characterization for structurally complex reservoirs (e.g., Jamison, 1997, 2016; Wennberg et al., 2006, 2007; Awdal et al., 2013, 2016; Sanai et al., 2015; Watkins et al., 2018).\nThis study documents the spatial and temporal evolution of complex fracture networks in a macroscale fault\u2013bend fold called the \u2018Sinon Anticline\u2019 in the southwestern Hongseong\u2013Imjingang Belt, Korea, and aims to decipher their relationship to the deformation process, fracture network connectivity, and fluid migration. We present comprehensive fracture data (i.e., fracture origin, orientation, intensity, and cross-cutting\/abutting relationship) obtained from various structural positions in the Sinon Anticline. We use the fracture topology concept (Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018) to estimate fracture network connectivity and permeability. Topological analysis is an efficient and advantageous method for expressing the spatial relationship between fractures because it quantifies the connectivity and percolation property of natural fracture network systems (Morley and Nixon, 2016; Duffy et al., 2017; S\u00e6vik and Nixon, 2017; Sanderson and Nixon, 2018; Nixon et al., 2020; Primaleon et al., 2020). Based on fracture and topological analyses, we have developed kinematic model for evolution of the Sinon Anticline and the related internal strain expressed by the fracture networks in response to crustal shortening and fold formation. Our findings show that the fault\u2013bend folding at shallow crustal levels might lead to a sequential flexural slip among different layers. Furthermore, the heterogeneous deformation caused by strain partitioning during the flexural folding result in a significant variation of the fracture network architecture and the fluid migration characteristics.\n\n\n2\nGeological settings and study area\n\n2.1\nGeneral geology\nThe Korean Peninsula includes three Precambrian basement blocks (the Nangnim, Gyeonggi, and Yeongnam massifs from north to south), which are mainly composed of Paleoproterozoic granitoids and gneisses (Fig. 1\na). These Precambrian basement blocks are separated by two Phanerozoic orogenic belts, the Hongseong\u2013Imjingang Belt and the Okcheon Belt (Cho and Kim, 2005; Kim et al., 2006, 2014a, 2018, 2019b; Cho et al., 2007, 2017; Kwon et al., 2009; de Jong et al., 2014, 2015; Park et al., 2014a, 2017; Kee et al., 2019a).\nThe Hongseong\u2013Imjingang Belt, recently refined by Kim et al. (2018, 2019b) and Kee et al. (2019a), is located along the central-western part of the Korean Peninsula (Fig. 1a and b). This orogenic belt preserves petrographic, geochemical, geochronological, and structural evidence of multiple orogenic events from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic age (Oh et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2006, 2017; Kwon et al., 2009; de Jong et al., 2014, 2015; Park et al., 2014a, b, 2017, 2018, 2019; Han et al., 2017; Park et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021). Based on the high-pressure metamorphic rocks reflecting a Permo\u2013Triassic crustal thickening event, likely related to the closure of Paleo-Tethys ocean, the area has been tectonically correlated with the Qinling\u2013Dabie\u2013Sulu orogenic belt in China (Oh et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2006, 2018; Cho et al., 2007; Kwon et al., 2013, 2020; Park et al., 2014b). However, the location of the Early Mesozoic suture zone in the Korean Peninsula remains controversial due to a lack of understanding of the orogenic architecture and structural modification during later orogenic cycles. The Late Triassic to Early Jurassic orogenic collapse and subsequent orogenic events associated with (Paleo) Pacific subduction have resulted in repeated crustal thickening and thinning, which caused modifications and inversions of earlier orogenic belts (Kim et al., 2011; de Jong et al., 2015; Park et al., 2018, 2019, 2020; Lee et al., 2021). The present-day Hongseong\u2013Imjingang Belt shows structural trends of NNE\u2013SSW in the southern part, N\u2013S to NW\u2013SE in the central region, and N\u2013S to E\u2013W in the northern part (Fig. 1b).\nThe study area is located in the Gomseom area, which is part of the southwestern Hongseong\u2013Imjingang Belt (Fig. 1b and c). The area is primarily composed of a Late Paleozoic metasedimentary sequence referred to as the Taean Formation. It consists of metasandstones intercalated with thin schist layers (Choi et al., 2008; Cho et al., 2010) that may originate from a flysch turbidite succession (So et al., 2013). The depositional age of the Taean Formation is estimated at between ca. 402 Ma and 229\u00a0Ma based on the U\u2013Pb ages from detrital zircons in the metasandstone and igneous zircons in younger intrusive rocks (Cho et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2014a, 2017). Late Triassic titanite U\u2013Pb and muscovite 40Ar\/39Ar ages from the Taean Formation (ca. 237\u2013228\u00a0Ma: de Jong et al., 2014, 2015; Kim et al., 2017) indicate that the timing of the post-collisional thermal pulse and the regional metamorphism is associated with the collapse of the Permo\u2013Triassic collisional orogen (Kwon et al., 2009; Park et al., 2018). The structural fabrics in the Anmyeondo\u2013Gomseom area are characterized by NNE\u2013SSW trend in the southern part, N\u2013S in the central part, and N\u2013S to NNW\u2013SSE near the study area (Fig. 1c). Choi et al. (2015) reported folds steeply plunging toward NE to ENE and NE-striking sinistral strike\u2013slip faults as the main geologic structures of the Taean Formation in the Anmyeondo area adjacent to the study area. Unfortunately, the poor outcrop exposure and the unclear spatial correlation of the turbidite sequence make it challenging to define the detailed geometry and kinematics of folds and faults across the islands.\nLarge-scale fold-and-fault systems and associated fracture networks are well developed in the Gomseom area (Kim et al., 2019a, 2020). Kim et al. (2019a, 2020) reported contractional deformation events and classified them into at least three stages (i.e., D1, D2, and D3) based on geometric and kinematic differences and cross-cutting relationships. The D3 structures, including the large-scale thrust-related anticlines and duplex-like structures with complex fracture networks, have disrupted bed-parallel foliation of the Taean Formation, indicating that their origin is likely associated with post-Triassic subduction-related crustal shortening under upper crustal conditions. These structures tilted during late stages of progressive contractional deformation or independent structural modification possibly related to Cretaceous basin formation (viz., Cheonsuman Formation; Fig. 1c), making it possible for us to observe the geometric and kinematic relationships between various structural elements in map view (Fig. 2\n; Kim et al., 2019a).\n\n\n2.2\nSinon Anticline: geometric characteristics and stratigraphy\nThe fault\u2013bend fold system represented by the Sinon Anticline has the following geometric characteristics (Fig. 2; Kim et al., 2019a): (1) a large-scale thrust with a curved ramp is overlain by a NW-verging hanging wall fold system showing, from NW to SE, a forelimb, an anticlinal hinge, a backlimb, a synclinal hinge, and a flat limb; (2) the thrust shows a footwall ramp overlain by a hanging wall flat and ramp, probably connecting low-angle detachments at different stratigraphic levels; (3) the antiformal hinge orientation is significantly different from the synformal hinge orientation; (4) an inferred axial trace of the hanging wall anticline terminates at the inferred fault bend; and (5) complex fractures show spatial variation in fracture intensity and orientation that depend on structural position. The separation or displacement of the underlying thrust cannot be estimated because of a lack of horizons that can be used for the stratigraphic correlation between the hanging wall and the footwall.\nThe stratigraphic column we measured (Fig. 3\n) shows that the folded hanging wall is lithologically classified into three domains (domains 1\u20133) according to the relative proportions of metasandstone and schist. Domains 1 and 3 are characterized by thick metasandstones interbedded with thin schists, while Domain 2 is characterized by evenly mixed metasandstones and schists. However, we also observed local variations in the bed thickness caused by lateral pinching out of schist layers.\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nFracture data acquisition and analysis\nDifferent fracture sampling methods, including linear scanline (Priest and Hudson, 1981; Priest, 1993; Santos et al., 2015; Watkins et al., 2015a; Sanderson and Peacock, 2019), circular scanline (Mauldon et al., 2001; Rohrbaugh et al., 2002; Watkins et al., 2015a), areal sampling (Wu and Pollard, 1995; Watkins et al., 2015a), and rectangular window sampling (Pahl, 1981; Priest, 1993; Watkins et al., 2015a), have different advantages and disadvantages. The methods are chosen depending on time consumption, outcrop accessibility, and research objective. In this study, we used a linear scanline sampling method to collect the fracture data because it can efficiently and quickly record a closely-spaced complex fracture network within a limited outcrop (Wennberg et al., 2007; Ellis et al., 2012; Sanai et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2015; Awdal et al., 2016; Jamison, 2016; Basa et al., 2019; Sanderson and Peacock, 2019).\nThe sampling sites were four metasandstone-dominant layers (layers 1\u20134) with excellent lateral continuity that occupied different structural positions in the Sinon Anticline (Figs. 2a and 3). Layer 1 consists of a thick metasandstone bed (thickness: \u223c2\u00a0m); layers 2 and 3 comprise thin metasandstone beds (thickness: 0.5\u20131\u00a0m); and Layer 4 is characterized by extremely thick metasandstone beds (thickness: 1\u201310\u00a0m) that gradually increase in thickness from the forelimb to the flat limb with a lateral pinch-out of alternating schists (Fig. 2a).\nThe scanlines were set up at 22 sampling sites (GSL003\u2013GSL024, Fig. 2a; Supplementary Data 1) and ranged in length from 0.5\u00a0m to 3\u00a0m depending on the fracture intensity. We set up two or three scanlines at sampling sites where several fracture sets cross at high angles from each other. We obtained the fracture information, including the dip angle, dip direction, trace length, genetic type, and cross-cutting\/abutting relationships, from all the fractures intersecting the scanlines following the procedures presented by Priest (1993). After data collection, we classified the fracture sets recognized at each sampling site and established a relative chronology between fracture sets based on cross-cutting\/abutting relationships. The fracture intensity (number of fractures per meter) of each fracture set was calculated using Terzaghi correction (Terzaghi, 1965) to avoid the bias caused by the angular relationship between the scanline and the fracture set.\nWe unfolded the fractures to examine their genetic association with the macroscale fault-related fold in the framework of the pre-, syn-, and post-folding fracturing stages (Bergbauer and Pollard, 2004; Beaudoin et al., 2012; Burberry et al., 2019). The fractures which were passively rotated with inclined metasedimentary beds were restored to the original orientations before folding, so that the metasedimentary beds become horizontal. During the rotation procedure, the plunge of the fold hinges was first removed, followed by the removal of the dip of the limbs (Van Noten and Sintubin, 2019). We used the \u03c0-axes reconstructed by the poles to the metasandstone beds of layers 1\u20134 (Fig. 2b) to estimate the anticlinal and synclinal hinge orientations during the unfolding.\n\n\n3.2\nTopological analysis\nIn two dimensions, fracture networks are composed of nodes, lines, and branches that are used to describe the geometry and the interrelationship of network elements (Fig. 4\na; Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018). Nodes indicate fracture terminations and intersections and are classified into three types depending on whether the fracture tips are isolated (I-node), abutting (Y-node), or crossing (X-node). Lines indicate fracture traces and can be subdivided into one or more branches between nodes. Branches are defined according to the types of nodes they connect (i.e., isolated (I\u2013I), partly connected (I\u2013C), and doubly connected (C\u2013C)). C means either a Y- or X-node, while I denotes an I-node. The proportions of different types of nodes and branches can be plotted on triangular diagrams referred to as node and branch triangles, respectively (Fig. 4b; Morley and Nixon, 2016). These triangle diagrams are used to compare the network topologies of different fracture systems (Morley and Nixon, 2016; Duffy et al., 2017; Nixon et al., 2020; Primaleon et al., 2020).\nVarious topological parameters, including the total lines\/branches, connectivity, intensity, and dimensionless intensity, are calculated using the number of different node types (i.e., NI, NY, and NX) (Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018). As a useful parameter for comparing the connectivity between fracture networks, the average number of connections per branch (CB) is typically used and given as follows:\n\nCB = (3NY\u00a0+\u00a04NX) \/ NB\n\n\nwhere, NB represents the number of branches given as follows:\n\nNB = (NI\u00a0+\u00a03NY\u00a0+\u00a04NX) \/ 2\n\n\n\nThe CB values range from 0 to 2 based on their mathematical relationship and can be contoured onto the node and branch triangles (Fig. 4b; Sanderson and Nixon, 2015).\nIn addition, the fracture network topology can be used to evaluate the hydraulic property of the rock volume (viz., percolation). Although Sanderson and Nixon (2018) evaluated the percolation of the fracture networks using a dimensionless intensity, it is difficult to apply the methods to complex natural fracture networks without a random distribution or a simple pattern. S\u00e6vik and Nixon (2017) used hydraulic connectivity (f) defined through numerical simulations in various complex synthetic or natural fracture systems. The variable f can be contoured onto the node triangle (Fig. 4c) and is given as follows:\n\n\nf\u00a0=\u00a0max (0, {2.94 \u00b7 (4NX\u00a0+\u00a02NY)} \/ (4NX\u00a0+\u00a02NY\u00a0+\u00a0NI)\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.13)\n\n\n\nWhen f has a positive value, this fracture network is considered to be above the percolation threshold, which is the minimum value to be a \u201cconnected\u201d network.\nWe evaluated the connectivity and hydraulic connectivity of the fracture networks through a topological analysis at 11 sampling sites in layers 3 and 4 (Fig. 2). Each two-dimensional fracture network at the sampling sites was digitized and analyzed using the NetworkGT toolbox in ArcGIS (Nyberg et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n4\nStructural observations\n\n4.1\nMain fracture sets\nWe classified seven major fracture sets at various structural positions (viz., forelimb, anticlinal hinge, backlimb, synclinal hinge, and flat limb) of the Sinon Anticline based on current orientation, abutting\/cross-cutting relationships, and geometric interrelationship with the fold. The fracture sets are referred to herein as sets 1 to 7 in relative chronological order.\n\n4.1.1\nSet 1\nSet 1 fractures are recognized in the majority of structural positions on the fold. They are sub-perpendicular to the metasedimentary beds and generally strike sub-perpendicular to the \u03c0-axes in the synclinal hinge and flat limb (Fig. 5\n). These fractures gradually change orientation anticlockwise from the synclinal hinge to forelimb (Fig. 5). Thus, they strike at an intermediate-to-high-angle to the \u03c0-axes of the fold in the forelimb, anticlinal hinge, and backlimb (Fig. 5). They are assumed to have originated as joints (mode I fractures) because of presence of plumose structures with rare evidence of shear movement. Some of them have slickenlines (Fig. 6\na), which reflect their later movements as faulted joints (Wilkins et al., 2001). The Set 1 fracture intensity varies from 1.62\/m to 14.12\/m, irrespective of the structural positions, and shows higher intensities in Layer 3 than in Layer 4 (Fig. 7\n).\n\n\n4.1.2\nSet 2\nSet 2 fractures abut Set 1 fractures (Fig. 6b) in most structural positions of the fold. Set 2 fractures are sub-perpendicular to the beds and strike sub-parallel to the \u03c0-axes of the fold in the synclinal hinge and flat limb (Fig. 5). These fractures systematically change their orientation anticlockwise from the synclinal hinge to forelimb (Fig. 5) and thus strike at a low-to-intermediate-angle with respect to the \u03c0-axes in the forelimb, anticlinal hinge, and backlimb (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, Set 1 and 2 fractures maintain a mutually sub-perpendicular angular relationship (Fig. 5). Set 2 fractures also have a plumose structure with rare evidence of shear movement, reflecting their origin as joints. Some of them have slickenlines as evidence of later reactivation. The Set 2 fracture intensity tends to increase toward the anticlinal and synclinal hinges, except for those at the sampling sites along Layer 4 (Figs. 6c and 7). For Layer 4, the sampling sites in the backlimb have intensity values ranging from 8.3\/m to 9.6\/m, higher than the 5.97\/m and 6.39\/m intensities measured at the sampling sites in the anticlinal and synclinal hinges, respectively. The Set 2 fracture intensity in Layer 4 is higher than in Layer 3.\n\n\n4.1.3\nSet 3\nSimilarly, Set 3 fractures are in the majority of the structural positions within the fold. They strike sub-parallel to the \u03c0-axes of the fold and are sub-parallel to the beds (Fig. 5). These fractures do not show evidence of slip on the fracture planes. The Set 3 fracture intensity tends to increase toward the anticlinal and synclinal hinges, with the anticlinal hinge having the highest intensity ranging from 12.57\/m to 18.73\/m (Figs. 7 and 8\na). The Set 3 fracture intensity in layers 1 and 4 is higher than in layers 2 and 3.\n\n\n4.1.4\nSets 4 and 5\nSet 4 and 5 fractures mainly occur in the synclinal hinge and flat limb. They are sub-perpendicular to the beds and strike sub-perpendicular and sub-parallel to the \u03c0-axes of the fold, respectively, showing a mutually orthogonal relationship (Fig. 5). The abutting relationship indicates their formation after the Set 1 to 3 fractures (Fig. 8b and c). Set 4 and 5 fractures are classified as joints, as illustrated by plumose structure and lack of evidence for slip. The Set 4 and 5 fracture intensities are the highest at the synclinal hinge (i.e., 14.85\/m for Set 4 and 10.68\/m for Set 5; Fig. 7).\n\n\n4.1.5\nOther fracture sets\nSet 6 and 7 fractures are steeply dipping and strike N\u2013S and E\u2013W, respectively (Fig. 5). They have a consistent orientation, regardless of the structural and stratigraphic positions, and are abutting to Set 1\u20135 fractures. These fractures do not show evidence for slip.\n\n\n\n4.2\nInterlayer slip indicators\nVarious asymmetric structures related to interlayer slip are developed in the study area (Fig. 9\n). The intercalating thin schist layers were assumed to act as a weak horizon and contribute to the interlayer slip. The strata-bounded asymmetric structures, such as bookshelf structures and shear fabric, present top-to-the-southeast (Fig. 9a) and northwest (Fig. 9b) sense of shear along the forelimb and backlimb, respectively, indicating top-toward-the antiformal hinge shears. In the flat limb, an offset mafic dyke cut by layer-parallel faults illustrates the top-to-the-southeast sense of shear (Fig. 9c and d). Notably, the fault tip damage zones (Kim et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2016; Peacock et al., 2017) are well developed in the flat limb where the schist layers are frequently pinched out (Fig. 9e). The asymmetric secondary fracture pattern in the tip damage zones presents a top-to-the southeast shear, consistent with the displaced mafic dyke. The top-to-the SE movement along the flat limb means a top-toward-the antiformal hinge shear, considering another antiformal hinge referred to as Gomseom Anticline to the southeast of the flat limb (Kim et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n5\nTopology and connectivity of the fracture networks\nEach sampled fracture network shows different topological characteristics according to their structural positions (Fig. 10\n; Supplementary Data 2; Table 1\n). Fig. 11\n plots the proportion of each node and branch type for the fracture networks at the 11 sampling sites in layers 3 and 4 (Fig. 2). The node triangles depict a high proportion of Y-nodes in all the mapped fracture networks. The I-node ratio in the forelimb is relatively higher than in the other structural positions. All fracture networks are plotted around the IC\u2013CC axis of the branch triangle because of the low proportion of I\u2013I branches (Fig. 11; Table 1). The ratio of the C\u2013C branch is the highest, ranging from 84% to 91% in the anticlinal and synclinal hinges. The average number of CB tends to increase from the fold limbs (1.64\u20131.88) to fold hinges (1.84\u20131.89), although site GSL019 in the flat limb shows a markedly high value of 1.96 (Fig. 11c; Table 1). The fracture networks in layers 3 and 4 yield similar CB values at identical structural positions (Fig. 11; Table 1), indicating the negligible effect of bed thickness on the fracture network connectivity. They show positive hydraulic connectivity (f) above the percolation threshold (Fig. 12\n; Table 1). Moreover, the f values increase toward the fold hinges (0.53\u20130.64; Fig. 12; Table 1).\n\n\n6\nInterpretation\n\n6.1\nVertical axis rotation during the fault\u2013bend folding\nThe Sinon Anticline is a thrust-related fault\u2013bend fold in the Hongseong\u2013Imjingang Belt that has experienced multiple orogenic cycles (Fig. 2; Kim et al., 2019a). It was caused by bending of a thrust sheet as it moved over a fault surface with a flat\u2013ramp\u2013flat geometry at shallow crustal levels (Suppe, 1983; Medwedeff and Suppe, 1997; Tavani et al., 2015). This type of fold is ubiquitous in orogenic belts worldwide and has been a target for deciphering the style of contractional deformation and related strains in response to crustal shortening (Srivastava and Engelder, 1990; Chester et al., 1991; Zoetemeijer and Sassi, 1992; Jamison and Pope, 1996; Rowan and Linares, 2000; Calamita et al., 2012).\nBefore determining the evolution of the Sinon Anticline and internal fracture networks in response to crustal shortening, we note that the synclinal and anticlinal hinge orientations estimated by the \u03c0-axes are significantly different (Fig. 2b). The synclinal hinge is plunging toward the southeast, whereas the anticlinal hinge is toward the northeast. The antiformal hinge shows a rotation of approximately 60\u00b0\u2013100\u00b0 anticlockwise relative to the synclinal hinge. This discrepancy is assumed to be caused by anticlockwise vertical axis rotations when the hanging wall slides up over a ramp (Pueyo et al., 2003; Yonkee and Weil, 2010a, b; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013). The macroscale curvature caused by the vertical axis rotations of thrust sheets is a ubiquitous feature of orogenic belts (Marshak, 2004; Kwon and Mitra, 2004; Sussman and Weil, 2004). The vertical axis rotation can generally be explained through various mechanisms, such as the interference of a younger thrust belt (Marshak and Tabor, 1989), influence of the oblique ramp (Boyer, 1995), cross-cutting by a strike\u2013slip fault (Lawrence et al., 1981; Marshak, 2004), and differential transport to the foreland (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013). Although the cause and mechanism of the vertical axis rotation of the study area cannot be fully resolved due to the lack of information in regards to the three-dimensional fault geometry and spatial variation in displacement, several structural phenomena seem harmonious with the syn-folding rotations because the rotation must have affected the internal deformation of the Sinon Anticline.\nFirst, Set 1 and 2 fractures in the forelimb, anticlinal hinge, and backlimb do not retain the original angular relationship with the hinge (Fig. 5) probably due to the relatively large rotation and migration of the anticlinal hinge (Fig. 2b). Secondly, some Set 1 and 2 fractures originating as joints experienced strike\u2013slip movement (Fig. 13\n). Some fractures have two slickenlines on their surface (Fig. 6a), indicating a progressive block rotation during the anticline amplification. Thirdly, Set 2 fractures show high intensity in the backlimb (Figs. 6c and 7), likely caused by the bed-parallel extension related to differential rotation between the forelimb and flat limb.\n\n\n6.2\nGenetic interpretation of the fracture sets\nWe carefully interpreted the origins of the seven fracture sets based on the (1) geometric relationships between the fracture sets and fold using present-day (Fig. 5) and unfolded fracture data (Fig. 14\n) and (2) spatial variation in the fracture intensity depending on the structural positions (Fig. 7) to decipher the spatial and temporal evolutions of the fracture networks during the fault\u2013bend folding.\nThe oldest Set 1 fractures are \u201ccross-strike joints\u201d, defined by Engelder and Geiser (1980) as vertical joints cutting fold axes at a high angle. Cross-strike joints are often found in many fold\u2013thrust belts (Bellahsen et al., 2006; Wennberg et al., 2007; Hayes and Hanks, 2008; Reif et al., 2012; Branellec et al., 2015; Jamison, 2016; Ali, 2017; Burberry et al., 2019) and likely result from layer-parallel shortening (LPS) before folding (Yonkee et al., 2013; Tavani et al., 2015). Set 1 fractures were probably formed during the LPS due to (1) their regional distribution and irregular spatial variation in intensity (Figs. 5 and 7) and (2) their origin as high-angle extensional joints sub-perpendicular to the synclinal fold hinge (Fig. 14). The geometric relationship most likely reflects a negligible or slight vertical axis rotation of the synclinal hinge during thrusting and related folding.\nSet 2 fractures are typical of the \u201cstrike joints\u201d that Engelder and Geiser (1980) defined as vertical joints sub-parallel to the fold axes. Strike joints are also commonly reported in many studies on fold-related fractures and are widely considered to be formed by outer-arc extension during folding (Hayes and Hanks, 2008; Reif et al., 2012; Jamison, 2016; Ali, 2017; Burberry et al., 2019). The strike joint intensity increases toward the hinges (Bellahsen et al., 2006; Wennberg et al., 2007) due to the heterogeneous layer-parallel extension, as evidenced by spatial variation in the Set 2 fracture intensity (Fig. 7). Some of Set 2 fractures would be reactivated as faulted joints (Fig. 13b; Jamison, 2016), showing a dip\u2013slip movement due to the extension accumulation at the fold hinges. During flexural folding, the inner-arc contractions also lead to the formation of bed-parallel fractures (Hayes and Hanks, 2008; Reif et al., 2012). The bed-sub-parallel Set 3 fractures with an increased intensity toward the fold hinges (Figs. 5 and 7) are assumed to be formed by the inner-arc contractions. Set 3 fractures might have formed under the influence of pre-existing primary fabric in response to internal strain in the Sinon Anticline.\nThe mutually orthogonal sets 4 and 5, which mainly occurred in the trailing part of the thrust sheet, including the synclinal hinge and flat limb (Fig. 5), are oblique at a slight angle to the mutually orthogonal sets 1 and 2 (Fig. 14). We interpreted the younger sets 4 and 5 to have developed in response to the LPS and outer-arc extension, respectively, during or after the anticlockwise rotation. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the Set 4 and 5 fractures are sub-perpendicular and sub-parallel, respectively, to the negligibly or slightly rotated synclinal hinge (Fig. 14).\nSet 6 and 7 fractures have no geometrical association with the Sinon Anticline (Fig. 5) and are interpreted to have formed after the fault\u2013bend folding ended because of their consistent orientation in different structural positions. They might be related to the tilting events after folding, which caused the current attitude of the Sinon Anticline. Unfortunately, their origin cannot be estimated with confidence because of the limited information available about the post-orogenic structural evolution of the fold\u2013thrust belt.\n\n\n6.3\nRelationships between the fold-related fractures and fracture network topology\nOur topological analysis results show that the fracture network connectivity tends to increase toward the anticlinal and synclinal hinges (Fig. 11; Table 1), where Set 2 and 3 fractures frequently occur due to intensive strain related to the outer-arc extension and inner-arc contractions (Fig. 7). Even sampling site GSL019 in the flat limb, characterized by the exceptionally high intensity of the Set 3 fractures (Fig. 7), shows high network connectivity (Fig. 11). In other words, sets 2 and 3 significantly enhanced the fracture network connectivity in the Sinon Anticline, reflecting that the folding mechanism and related strain pattern are closely associated with the spatial variation in the connectivity of the fold-related fracture networks.\nIn particular, Set 3 fractures significantly increased the hydraulic connectivity of the fracture network in the Sinon Anticline. When these fractures were removed at the sampling sites for the topological analysis situated in Layer 4 of the forelimb, anticlinal hinge, and backlimb (Fig. 12b and d), the number of Y-nodes at the sampling sites significantly decreased, with the CB and f values dropping some fracture networks below a percolation threshold. We highlight that the bed-sub-parallel Set 3 fractures likely formed by inner-arc contraction play a critical role in linking the earlier Set 1 and 2 fractures sub-perpendicular to the beds and diversifying fracture orientation.\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nStrain partitioning during the evolution of the fold-related fracture network\nTypical of the classic fault\u2013bend fold model (Suppe, 1983), the Sinon Anticline maintains constant bed thickness in different structural positions, demonstrating the importance of flexural folding as a mechanism during its formation (Ramsay, 1967; Fossen, 2016). The alternation of the relatively thick competent metasandstone and thin incompetent schist defines a prominent lithology in the turbidite sequence of the Taean Formation (Fig. 3). This multilayer condition is suitable for inducing a flexural (bed-parallel) slip during folding because of the displacement localizations associated with mechanically weak layer interfaces (Behzadi and Dubey, 1980; Tanner, 1989; Cosgrove, 2015). In the study area, various slip indicators in the fold limbs (e.g., an offset mafic dyke, a bookshelf structure, shear fabric, and fault tip damage zones; Fig. 9) support the top-toward-anticlinal hinge senses of movements, indicating the flexural slip during the fault\u2013bend folding. However, the folding-related strain patterns in the Sinon Anticline expressed as the fractures cannot be solely explained by the flexural slip model (Ramsay and Huber, 1987).\nIn contrast to the evidence for the concentration of the syn-folding fractures in the hinge area described above (Fig. 7), the classic flexural slip model predicts negligible strain in the hinge zones (Ramsay, 1967; Fossen, 2016). We assume that this concentration reflects the strain patterns resulting from the orthogonal flexure (Twiss and Moores, 2007), also referred to as the tangential longitudinal strain (TLS; Ramsay, 1967), at the hinge zones during the fault\u2013bend folding. In addition, Set 2 and 3 fractures likely associated with the outer-arc extension and inner-arc contractions, respectively, coexist in stratigraphically separated metasandstone layers (Fig. 5). Therefore, a proper explanation is necessary to understand these complex strain states in the Sinon Anticline.\nThe importance of the interlayer slip during folding process has been commonly reported in many previous studies (Donath and Parker, 1964; Ramsay, 1967; Ghosh, 1968; Dubey and Cobbold, 1977; Ferrill et al., 2007; Fagereng and Byrnes, 2015). However, there is also a consideration that interlayer slip does not occur in all available bed-to-bed contacts (Chapple and Spang, 1974; Johnson and Page, 1976; Behzadi and Dubey, 1980; Tanner, 1989, 1990, 1992; Fitches et al., 1990; Wennberg et al., 2007; Hayes and Hanks, 2008). Couples et al. (1998) proposed a revised flexural slip fold model in layered rocks to emphasize the separation of the independent mechanical unit layers by incompetent layers acting as a slip surface (Fig. 15\n). In their model, a mechanical unit layer bounded by active interlayer slip surfaces records the TLS during its bending (Fig. 15a). When a new slip surface is activated (Fig. 15b), the existing mechanical unit is segmented, and the resultant strain partitioning eventually causes superposed strain patterns (Fig. 15c and d). We assume that the coexistence of Set 2 and 3 fractures in each metasandstone layer in the Sinon Anticline reflects the strain partitioning and hierarchical overprinting of TLS in association with the sequential interlayer slips as an alternative flexural fold model that supplements previous classic models.\n\n\n7.2\nSynthetic kinematic model\nWe reconstructed a synthetic kinematic model of the Sinon Anticline in the framework of the pre-folding, early syn-folding, and late syn-folding stages based on the genetic interpretation of the fracture network under study. In each stage, the fracture networks are described while considering the effects of the bed thickness and structural positions.\nIn the pre-folding stage, LPS caused a horizontal extension perpendicular to the shortening direction, which resulted in the development of Set 1 fractures (Fig. 16\na). Set 1 fracture intensity is relatively high in the thinner metasandstone layers compared with thicker layers, such as those in layers 3 and 4 (Figs. 3 and 7; Ladeira and Price, 1981; Wu and Pollard, 1995; Wennberg et al., 2007; Fossen, 2016).\nIn the early stage of the fault\u2013bend folding, Set 2 and 3 fractures were developed to accommodate TLS contemporaneously with flexural interlayer slips (Fig. 16b). Sequential flexural slips caused segmentation in the mechanical unit layers, and the resultant strain partitioning led to the superposed TLS generating high connectivity of the fracture network in the hinge zones (Fig. 11).\nAnticlockwise vertical axis rotations occurred in the Sinon Anticline during the fold amplification in the late folding stage. This rotation resulted in a more complex fracture network (Fig. 16c). In the backlimb, Set 2 parallel fractures were developed (Fig. 6c) to accommodate a layer-parallel extension that was caused by the difference in the degree of rotation between the anticlinal and synclinal hinges (Fig. 2b). In response to the vertical axis rotation, the previously formed Set 1 and 2 extensional fractures were selectively reactivated as strike\u2013slip faults in the forelimb and flat limb, respectively (Fig. 13). In addition, the hinge-parallel extension during the vertical axis rotation (Marshak, 2004; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; Burberry et al., 2019) probably reactivated Set 1 fractures selectively as dip\u2013slip faults (Fig. 13). Progressive regional shortening and TLS, which formerly caused the formation of Set 1 and 2 fractures, developed Set 4 and 5 fractures in the synclinal hinge and flat limb. Fold amplification led to the development of additional flexural slip surfaces and an increasing number of various interlayer slip-related asymmetric structures (Fig. 9).\n\n\n7.3\nImplications for fluid flow\nThe natural fracture system in moderate-to low-permeability rock acts as a significant path for fluid flow (Nelson, 1985; Pollard and Aydin, 1988; Priest, 1993; Aguilera, 1995; Berkowitz, 2002; Matthai and Belayneh, 2004; Narasimhan, 2005; Rawnsley et al., 2007; Amoruso et al., 2013). The connectivity of the fracture system (Balberg et al., 1991; Jamison, 1997; Odling et al., 1999) and timing and nature of fracturing (Mayer and Sharp, 1998) can influence the flow properties of reservoir rocks. The fracture networks at the sampling sites in the Sinon Anticline are highly connected, and their high hydraulic connectivity reflects excellent potential for fluid migration parallel to the metasandstone layers at all structural positions (Figs. 11 and 12). Notably, the sequential development of fold-related fractures is closely related to the evolution of flow properties during fault\u2013bend folding (Fig. 12d). When TLS developed Set 2 and 3 fractures during progressive folding, the hydraulic connectivity of the metasandstone layers preferentially exceeded the percolation threshold in the hinge zones.\nHowever, the hydraulic connectivity of each metasandstone layer may not be representative of the Sinon Anticline's overall flow property. The localized petrophysical alteration caused by flexural interlayer slips (Pitman, 1981; Knipe, 1992; Antonellini and Aydin, 1994; Knipe et al., 1997) probably influenced the flow property. The reduction of porosity and permeability of the slip-localized layer during flexural slips (Lewis and Couples, 1993; Gibson, 1998) can cause the deformed layer to act as a barrier to fluid migration (Couples et al., 1998). Although this may be difficult to distinguish from other trapping mechanisms related to stratigraphy, we believe that this sealing mechanism interrupted the fluid migration across the metasandstone beds in the limbs of the Sinon Anticline. We can infer a stratigraphically controlled heterogeneous fluid migration pattern by considering the lithologic domains characterized by the different ratios of metasandstone and schist layers (Fig. 3). Upward fluid migration is likely more active in domains 1 and 3, characterized by thick metasandstones; meanwhile, Domain 2, characterized with a higher proportion of schist, may be limited in upwards fluid migration as a lateral conduit.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThe Sinon Anticline in the southwestern Hongseong\u2013Imjingang Belt in Korea is a typical fault\u2013bend fold that underwent flexural folding during its formation. The complex fracture distribution within the Sinon Anticline reflects its complicated deformation history, including the pre-, syn-, and post-folding stages and related strain states. This study emphasizes that mechanical stratigraphy, the sequential flexural interlayer slip along schist layers, and superposed TLS in the metasandstone layers caused complex fracture networks in the Sinon Anticline. Another potential factor influencing the fracture network complexity is heterogeneous anticlockwise vertical axis rotations when sliding up the ramp. The superposed TLS led to considerably high (hydraulic) connectivity of the fracture networks in the hinge zones, where the outer-arc extension and inner-arc contractions occur. Notably, the bed-sub-parallel extensional fractures caused by the inner-arc contractions were critical in connecting the bed-perpendicular fractures caused by the LPS and outer-arc extension and increasing network connectivity. However, we assume that the sequential flexural slips along the schist layers in the limbs of the Sinon Anticline had a sealing effect, which prevented fluid migration across the slip zones comparting the highly fractured metasandstone layers. Our results suggest that natural reservoirs affected by fault\u2013bend folding at shallow crustal levels experience flexure-related brittle deformation and their fluid migration characteristics are probably heterogeneous because of the spatiotemporal variation in the mechanical processes during flexure.\n\n\nCRediT author statements\n\nInho Kim: Conceptualization, Investigation, Data curation; Formal analysis, Writing - original draft.\n\nSeung-Ik Park: Supervision, Conceptualization, Writing \u2013 Review and Editing, Project administration, Funding acquisition.\n\nSanghoon Kwon: Conceptualization, Writing \u2013 Review and Editing.\n\nHong-Jin Lee: Software, Visualization.\n\n","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"","73":"","74":"","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nDeformation, fluid flow and diagenesis are strongly interactive processes that determine the evolution and properties of clastic sediments and rocks during and following deposition (e.g., Knipe, 1993; Laubach et al., 2010). For example, the style and mechanisms of deformation are highly dependent on the diagenetic state of such host rocks. In unconsolidated and\/or poorly lithified, highly porous granular rocks, deformation is commonly accommodated by grain reorganization or crushing that often result in the formation of deformation bands (e.g., Mandl et al., 1977; Aydin, 1978; Rawling and Goodwin, 2003; Fossen et al., 2018, and references therein). Fluids flow through open pore space in such sedimentary rock and may locally be guided by deformation bands or other heterogeneities such as stratification (e.g., Antonellini and Aydin, 1994; Phillips, 2009; Balsamo et al., 2012; Del Sole et al., 2020; Dimmen et al., 2020). Increasing compaction and cementation leads to a reduction of porosity and permeability (e.g., Houseknecht, 1987; Lundegard, 1992; Pizzati et al., 2020), while at the same time to an increase of the tensile strength of the rock (e.g., Dyke and Dobereiner, 1991; Cook et al., 2015). The latter promotes a transition from grain scale deformation processes of particulate\/granular and cataclastic flow processes (see e.g. Men\u00e9ndez et al., 1996; Rawling and Goodwin, 2003) to discrete brittle failure, with fracture formation providing new pathways for fluids (e.g., Fisher et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2017). In turn, pore fluids may, for example, promote cementation, slow the rate of compaction, or be responsible for the creation of secondary porosity, depending on their pressure and composition (e.g., Bj\u00f8rlykke, 1988; Taylor et al., 2010).\nIn general, diagenesis of clastic sediments is a function of temperature, burial pressure, and fluid and sediment chemistry (e.g., Bj\u00f8rlykke, 1988; Worden and Burley, 2003). The presence\/development of faults may significantly affect these processes e.g. by influencing heat flow (e.g., Bellani et al., 2004; Townend et al., 2017; Vanneste et al., 2005) and fluid circulation (e.g., Gibson, 1998; Eichhubl and Boles, 2000; Balsamo et al., 2013; Bense et al., 2013). The results of such influence have been showcased along the Dombjerg Fault, a major basin-bounding fault in the NE Greenland rift system (Kristensen et al., 2016; Salomon et al., 2020; Fig. 1\n). Here, syn-rift siliciclastic deposits in the hanging wall, juxtaposed against a footwall of crystalline basement, are affected by pervasive fault-proximal calcite cementation, which is interpreted to have resulted from fault-controlled fluid flow and diagenesis.\nPreviously, Kristensen et al. (2016) have given an overview over the overall structure of the Dombjerg Fault damage zone, and Salomon et al. (2020) analyzed the related fault-controlled diagenetic history and paragenesis. Building on these previous works we here elucidate the effect of this structural and diagenetic evolution on the ensuing fluid flow and deformation history following the establishment of a calcite-cemented zone in the hanging wall of the Dombjerg Fault. The overarching aim of this study is to understand the effects of interaction of deformation, fluid flow and diagenesis operating in the proximity of large, basin-bounding fault systems in rift basins. More specifically, we here aim to understand how these fault-to-basin-scale processes are reflected on a microstructural scale. The work is based on microstructural analyses of the main deformation structures occurring within a distance of 0\u20133.5\u00a0km of the fault, i.e. veins within the calcite cementation zone, and deformation bands in the uncemented clastic deposits outside the cementation zone. We show that deformation bands acted as local baffles to fluid flow, while cementation created compartments of fluid overpressure that was repeatedly released upon fracturing.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe East Greenland rift system is a long-lived rift system whose formation initiated in the Devonian and which was active episodically throughout Paleozoic and Mesozoic times, until continental breakup and opening of the North Atlantic in the Early Eocene times (e.g., Larsen and Watt, 1985; Surlyk, 1990; Stemmerik et al., 1991; Rotevatn et al., 2018). The rift system is exposed onshore East Greenland along the coast between 68 and 77\u00b0N (Henriksen, 2003; Fig. 1a). It is characterized by a right-stepping N\u2013S to NNW-SSE trending border fault network, with segment lengths of 170\u2013230\u00a0km (Fig. 1a) and with vertical throws up to \u223c5\u00a0km (Surlyk, 2003).\nThe Dombjerg Fault is part of this border fault system and marks the western margin of the Wollaston Forland Basin (Fig. 1b). Activity of the fault started in the Carboniferous (Rotevatn et al., 2018) and culminated in a main rift phase in the Late Jurassic\/Early Cretaceous (e.g., Surlyk, 1984) at which time the Wollaston Forland Basin was established as a syn-rift half-graben depocentre east of the fault (cf. Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000). The infill of this half-graben basin can be subdivided into stages of early syn-rift, rift climax, and late syn-rift deposits (sensu Surlyk and Korstg\u00e5rd, 2013; Prosser, 1993). Early syn-rift deposits of Middle to Late Jurassic age are represented by marine sandstones with thin interlayers of mudstone (i.e. Vardekl\u00f8ft and Hall Bredning Groups; Fig. 1b; Surlyk and Korstg\u00e5rd, 2013). Rift climax and late syn-rift deposits of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age are assigned to the Wollaston Forland Group, an up to \u223c3\u00a0km thick clastic succession. The lower part of the succession consists predominantly of sandstones and conglomerates that were emplaced by fully submarine gravity flows (Lindemans Bugt Formation; rift climax; Henstra et al., 2016), whereas the succeeding part consists of marine sandstones and conglomerates interfingering with marine mudstones and carbonates (Palnatokes Bjerg Formation; late syn-rift; Fig. 1b, Surlyk and Korstg\u00e5rd, 2013).\nOf main relevance for this study is the Lindemans Bugt Formation, which forms a clastic wedge that is bounded by the Dombjerg Fault in the west and is gradually thinning eastward into the basin over a distance of 10\u201315\u00a0km (Fig. 1c; Henstra et al., 2016). The deposits of this unit are the erosional products derived from the footwall, which consists for the most part of Caledonian crystalline basement, and were transported as rock falls, debris flows, and turbidity currents into a deep-marine rift basin environment in the hanging wall (Fig. 1; Henstra et al., 2016).\n\nKristensen et al. (2016) and Salomon et al. (2020) have previously described the diagenetic and deformational character of the rift-climax deep-water clastic deposits of the Lindemans Bugt Formation. We here provide a summary of their main findings as context for the present study. The fault-proximal deposits of the Lindemans Bugt Formation were extensively cemented by calcite within a zone of up to \u223c1.5\u00a0km width into the hanging wall from the fault (Kristensen et al., 2016; Salomon et al., 2020; Figs. 2 and 3\n\n). Close to the fault, cementation is pervasive in the hanging wall deposits, though some beds and intervals remain uncemented (Fig. 3c). Towards the fault-distal margin of the cementation zone, the amount of calcite cement decreases. Here, calcite cement is irregularly distributed within beds, leaving uncemented bodies enclosed by cemented strata (Fig. 3a and b; Salomon et al., 2020). Farther eastward into the basin and outside the cementation zone, calcite cement is confined to selected conglomerate beds only.\nOverall, calcite cement pervasively fills intergranular space, which reduces the porosity of the affected deposits towards zero (Salomon et al., 2020) and results in a high competence contrast of the rock relative to the uncemented deposits, which remain porous and friable (Fig. 3a\u2013c). Calcite cementation started shortly after deposition of the clastic sediments during the rift climax in the Valanginian at temperatures between \u223c30 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C and an estimated burial depth of <1\u00a0km (Salomon et al., 2020). Calcite veins, which cut through the cemented rock, formed within a similar temperature range, but predominantly in the post-rift phase in the Aptian\/Albian (Salomon et al., 2020).\nThe Dombjerg Fault damage zone affects the Lindemans Bugt Formation up to \u223c500\u00a0m into the hanging wall (Kristensen et al., 2016). In fault-proximal outcrops (\u223c100\u00a0m from the fault), calcite veins and joints occur at densities of \u223c7 veins\/joints per meter; rarely, minor faults of <10\u00a0cm normal displacement are present. Towards the distal parts of the hanging wall damage zone, the vein and joint density decreases to 4 joints\/m and 1 calcite vein\/m (Kristensen et al., 2016; in the present study, we find similar densities also in outcrops \u223c1.4\u00a0km away from the fault). Joints consistently overprint veins. Where uncemented, the clastic sedimentary rock hosts deformation bands, while veins are absent. These deformation bands occurring outside the cementation zone, and the veins occurring within this zone, form the focus of the present study.\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThe study is based on a suite of samples acquired from the Dombjerg Fault hanging wall damage zone during a three-week field season in the summer of 2018. The samples were collected from sedimentary rocks in a transect extending from the fault and up to c. 3.5\u00a0km into the hanging wall. The samples comprise veins, deformation bands, and their associated wall\/host rocks. In total, we obtained samples for 14 thin sections of calcite veins cutting through cemented sandstones and conglomerates within the cementation zone most proximal to the fault (within c. 1.5\u00a0km distance from the fault). Sampling of deformation bands was challenging due to the friable state of the rocks outside the cementation zone; however, a total of 5 thin sections of deformation bands were successfully prepared. Thin sections were analyzed using a Keyence VHX digital optical microscope, a Technosyn 8200Mk II for cold-cathode cathodoluminescence, and Zeiss Supra 55VP and Hitachi TM4000plus scanning electron microscopes for BSE, EDX, and SEM-cathodoluminescence analyses. The two-dimensional porosity of the samples was determined by image analyses of BSE images mosaics using Adobe Photoshop. Previously obtained formation ages and temperatures of calcite veins and cements (based on U\u2013Pb calcite dating and clumped isotope analysis; see Salomon et al., 2020) provide time constraints on the studied cements and vein fills. In addition, oxygen and carbon isotope data of Salomon et al. (2020) provide information on fluid source for the vein fill, which is complemented here by \u03b413C measurements of six additional vein fill generation. Carbon isotopes were analyzed by reaction of carbonate powders with 100% phosphoric acid at 70\u00a0\u00b0C using a Gasbench II connected to a ThermoFisher Delta V Plus mass spectrometer. Reproducibility and accuracy was monitored by replicate analysis of laboratory standards calibrated by assigning a \u03b413C of +1.95\u2030 to NBS19 and -47.3\u2030 to IAEACO9 and was \u00b10.07\u2030 (1 std. dev.).\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nDeformation band characteristics\nDeformation bands occur in the uncemented deposits outside the cementation zone, and within uncemented bodies of sedimentary rock inside the cementation zone (Figs. 2 and 4\n); deformation bands are absent in the cemented deposits within the cementation zone. The overall trend of the deformation bands is E-NE and thus roughly similar to the orientation of the veins in the cemented deposits, with the caveat that this observation is based on a limited number of bands (n\u00a0=\u00a017; Fig. 2). In outcrop location 20 (Fig. 2), NE-trending deformation bands cross-cut an older set of NW-trending bands. This NW-trend is also present in a minor set of veins in the nearby location 18 (Fig. 2), although an age relationship between the two vein sets could not be established. One normal fault (Fig. 4f), also NE-trending, was found outside the cementation zone, which is visible in two outcrops \u223c20\u00a0m apart from each other. In one of these, the fault comprises a 25\u00a0cm-wide breccia zone (Fig. 4f), while in the second outcrop, this zone is splayed into a \u223c40\u00a0cm-wide cluster of deformation bands (\u22656 bands), some of which exhibit slickenside surfaces (Fig. 4e). Slickensides indicate normal throw to the NW (see stereographic plot Loc. 26 in Fig. 2). Fault offset clearly exceeds the vertical extent of the outcrop (5\u00a0m), as there are distinct marker horizons, but which in the hanging wall are downthrown to below the level of the exposure (samples from this fault are described below).\nDeformation band samples are taken from outcrop locations 22 (sample G-48), 23 (samples G-49, G-50), and 26 (samples G-57, G-60), thus from outside the cementation zone (Fig. 2). Samples G-57 and G-60 are derived from the fault described above; G-57 is from the deformation band cluster and G-60 from the center of the breccia zone (Fig. 4f). All deformation bands occur in angular-grained, moderately sorted, fine- to very coarse-grained sub-arkosic sandstone. The fault, represented by sample G-60, also cuts through matrix-supported conglomerate. The sampled bands have an overall strike of E to NE with dip angles between 70 and 81\u00b0 (Fig. 4b\u2013f). The amount of offset along the bands could only be determined for samples G-49 and G-50, which exhibit \u223c5\u00a0cm and \u223c1\u20132\u00a0cm of normal displacement, respectively.\nThe deformation bands appear slightly variable across the sample suit. Sample G-48 hosts a \u223c12.5\u00a0mm-wide deformation band that, in the thin section, is hard to differentiate from the host rock. The boundary is gradual and the band itself is characterized by a subtle reduction in grain size relative to the host rock, which we attribute to cataclasis (Fig. 5\na). The \u223c15\u00a0mm-wide deformation band in sample G-49 has a subtle boundary to the host rock, as well, and hosts a matrix of crushed material and is clast-supported (Fig. 5b). Traces of brownish coloration within the band can be attributed to fragmented biotite flakes. Sample G-50 hosts a \u223c1.5\u20133.0\u00a0mm-wide deformation band with a boundary to the wall rock that is more distinct, indicated by a strong brown coloration of the wall rock and a band with a high amount of crushed grains forming a matrix-supported structure (Fig. 5c and d). Similar characteristics apply to sample G-57, with the distinction that the thin section hosts an array of three \u223c2\u20134\u00a0mm wide deformation bands, that are separated by \u223c2.0\u20133.5\u00a0mm wide zones of compacted wall rock (Fig. 5e and f). G-60 exhibits across the whole thin section intense grain fracturing due to cataclasis, yet a large quantity of intact clasts are present as well (Fig. 5g and h).\n\n\n4.2\nAlteration associated with deformation bands\nThe sandstone hosting the deformation bands is altered at a varying degree that is expressed in outcrops by a coloration from light grey (seemingly unaltered state) to dark red. While a yellow coloration seems to have formed independently from deformation bands (Figs. 4a,b,f), a red coloration appears to be confined to the bands. Along the band represented by sample G-49 (Fig. 4c), the footwall host rock has a dominant red coloration which is present across the whole length of the footwall's exposure in the outcrop (\u223c5\u00a0m). Along the band represented by sample G-57 (Fig. 4e), the red coloration covers a \u223c5\u201330\u00a0cm wide zone of footwall host rock and fades into a light grey color farther into the footwall, which is also the dominant coloration of the hanging wall. In addition, in the cases of the bands shown in Fig. 4c and d and represented by samples G-49 and G-50, a dark red \u223c1\u00a0cm-wide rim occurs along both sides of the bands. In two occasions (Fig. 4c and d), the deformation bands splay and enclose a section of light grey host rock.\nWhile the yellow coloration presumably derives from the alteration of feldspar, the dark red coloration is caused by the precipitation of Fe-\/Ti-oxides and jarosite (Fig. 6\n). Oxides are abundant as rims between the lamellae of biotite flakes and in pore space and grain boundaries surrounding the mica. Jarosite appears as a fine mass in the vicinity to mica flakes although rarely in between mica lamellae (Fig. 6i; EDX spectra and element maps in supplements). A clear age relationship between oxide and jarosite formation could not be established from the thin section analysis. With distance to the deformation band the degree of biotite alteration declines and the presence of oxides and jarosite is commonly confined to parts of expanded\/deformed flakes of biotite (Fig. 6f and g). Within the deformation bands, biotite is highly deformed yet unaltered and oxides\/jarosite nearly completely absent (Fig. 6b and c).\n\n\n4.3\nDeformation band porosity analysis\nWe created BSE image mosaics for 2-D porosity image analysis of the five deformation band samples (Fig. 7\n, Table 1\n). In sample G-48, the wall rock has a porosity of 21.9% and the deformation band 14.9%. Sample G-49 yields a wall rock porosity of 18.5%, a deformation band porosity of 7.1%, and a porosity in the red-stained zone of 5.2%. In sample G-50, the wall rock has a porosity of 25.8%, the deformation band 13.6%, and the red-stained zone along the band 11.8%. Sample G-57 hosts three single deformation bands with porosities of 8.0%, 9.0%, 9.1%, respectively, while the slightly reddish altered wall rock has 17.6% porosity (Fig. 7). Sample G-58, which has been taken \u223c20\u00a0cm away from this band cluster in the more whitish rock (Figs. 4e and 7), the porosity is slightly higher with 21.6%. We note that all values should only be taken as a rough measure and may be overestimated (e.g., especially sample G-50 suffered from expansion during the epoxy impregnation due to its incohesive condition); however, we are interested in the relative differences rather than the exact values. Summarized, the deformation bands all exhibit lower porosity than their host rocks. Red-stained alteration zones, on the other hand, show somewhat variable porosity.\n\n\n4.4\nCalcite vein characteristics\nThe cemented deposits are dissected by calcite veins with an overall N-NE trend (Figs. 2 and 8\n), i.e. oblique to the trend of the Dombjerg Fault (NNW-trending; Fig. 2). Since most outcrops were exposed in 3-D, we regard this overall trend as unbiased by outcrop orientation. Vein thicknesses range from sub-millimetric to c. 7\u00a0cm. All analyzed veins exhibit at least one generation of elongate to blocky syntaxial crystal growth. Separate phases of vein growth are visible in two-thirds of the samples and distinguishable by variable quantities of dust or iron-oxide inclusions (Fig. 9\na\u2013d). Crack-seal events are present in 12 of the 14 samples and commonly occur at the contact of vein and wall rock, but occasionally breach through existing vein generations. In all crack-seal events, the younger vein generation does not exceed in thickness the initial vein generation. The majority of veins exhibit opening-mode displacement, while slip zones within the veins are found in three of the 14 samples (Fig. 9g and h).\nIn outcrop locations 4 and 17, situated approximately 500\u00a0m and 1400\u00a0m away from the fault into the hanging wall, respectively, a distinctively different vein fill is visible, which appears as an opaque, brownish to greyish calcite matrix that hosts sediment grains (Fig. 8b\u2013e). In thin section view of samples G-9, G-10, G-13 (all from location 4; Fig. 2), and G-37 (location 17), this vein fill identifies as multiple generations of microcrystalline calcite with calcite crystal sizes <10\u00a0\u03bcm that precede the blocky\/elongate crystal growth (Fig. 9e and f, 10\n). In the thin section of sample G-9 (Figs. 8b and 10a-c), taken from a vertical oriented face, the following characteristics stand out:\n\n\u2022\nA repetitive infill is observable: Quartz, feldspar, and other clasts as well as lithic fragments of cemented wall rock and of earlier vein generations are localized in a matrix of microcrystalline calcite at the bottom of each infill generation (c.f. point 4 in Fig. 10b). Upward, these components decrease in grain size and mica flakes become the dominant clast type. The remaining upper part of each section consists nearly exclusively of microcrystalline calcite.\n\n\n\u2022\nOlder vein generations are brecciated, with brecciated fragments consisting of pure microcrystalline calcite or microcrystalline calcite-hosting clasts (c.f. point 2 in Fig. 10a).\n\n\n\u2022\nIn at least one generation, mica flakes are aligned parallel to each other with their overall orientation guided by the outline of older vein generations (point 6 in Fig. 10c).\n\n\n\u2022\nIn the central section of the vein, a series of thin (<0.5\u00a0mm) veins exists with blocky\/elongate calcite crystals. These veins align parallel to an anastomosing set of thin (<0.05\u00a0mm), dark bands within the microcrystalline calcite (point 5 in Fig. 10b).\n\n\n\nSample G-37 derives from a fracture, in which the microcrystalline infill is visible from the base of its outcrop exposure upwards over \u223c50\u00a0cm where it is in contact with elongate calcite crystals (Fig. 8e), which fill the remaining upper section of the fracture as far as exposed. In addition, a crack-seal elongate\/blocky calcite vein generation has formed along the microcrystalline infill and wall rock (Fig. 8e). In the thin section of sample G-37, multiple generations of upward-fining vein fill are present, similar to the composition and texture in sample G-9 (point 7 in Fig. 10e). A notable difference to sample G-9 is the absence of crack-seal events with the repeated sealing with microcrystalline calcite. The vein of sample G-13, traceable in the outcrop only on a horizontal surface, comprises a horizontal transition of an elongate calcite vein to microcrystalline calcite hosting sediment grains (Fig. 10f).\nCarbonate \u03b413CVPDB values measured of six microcrystalline vein generations range from \u221217.9 to \u221213.2\u2030 (average \u221214.8\u2030; Table 2\n).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nDeformation band structure\nDeformation bands are exclusively found in host rocks absent of calcite cement in outcrops both within (in uncemented bodies) and outside the cementation zone; however, no deformation bands are found within cemented deposits, suggesting that the bands likely formed after calcite cementation and establishment of the wider cementation zone. We do, for example, not find any deformation bands overprinted by calcite cementation, which further strengthens the hypothesis that calcite cementation pre-dates the formation of deformation bands. Furthermore, the overall orientation of the bands is approximately parallel to the general trend of calcite veins (Fig. 2), which suggests they formed in the same stress system. The majority of veins have been dated to the Aptian\/Albian (\u223c123-104\u00a0Ma), coinciding with an extension phase from latest Valanginian to middle Albian times (Salomon et al., 2020; see also chapter 5.3).\nAll sampled deformation bands show a cataclastic reduction of grain size, a mechanism that is seen as the key-controlling factor to reduce porosity and permeability in deformation bands (e.g., Pittman, 1981; Antonellini et al., 1994; Ballas et al., 2015). Compared to the mostly unaltered wall rock, porosity within the deformation bands is reduced by approximately one to two thirds (Fig. 7, Table 1), which is well within the range of reported porosity losses from host rock to cataclastic deformation bands elsewhere (e.g., Aydin and Johnson, 1983; Antonellini and Aydin, 1994; Torabi and Fossen, 2009).\n\n\n5.2\nAlteration along deformation bands\nAt the outcrop scale, three of the analyzed five deformation bands exhibit a control on the degree of host rock alteration. This is indicated by the sharp transition across the band from a yellow\/white-colored hanging wall to a red-colored footwall (Figs. 4c,e; represented by samples G-49, G-57) as well as by the unaltered host rock enclosed by splaying deformation bands (Fig. 4c and d; samples G-49, G-50). Such alteration effects along deformation bands have been reported before by others and have been attributed to a control of the bands on local fluid flow (e.g., Exner and Tschegg, 2012; Ballas et al., 2012; Dimmen et al., 2020), and it is widely recognized that deformation bands may act as local baffles to flow due to the porosity and permeability reduction in the bands (e.g., Antonellini and Aydin, 1995; Rotevatn et al., 2009; Torabi et al., 2013; Philit et al., 2019).\nA clear trend between porosity and degree of host rock alteration is not visible in our dataset. In outcrop location 23, the deformation bands represented by samples G-49 and G-50 yield porosity values of 7.1% and 13.6%, respectively. Here, only the low-porosity band of G-50 shows a significant control on footwall alteration (Fig. 4c). Nevertheless, the high-porosity band of G-49 encloses unaltered host rock in a splay zone (Fig. 4d), showcasing the band's potential to also affect host rock alteration. In outcrop location 25, samples G-57 and G-60 derive from the same fault and yield similar porosity values of \u223c8\u20139%, yet alteration only occurs at the site of G-57 (Fig. 4e and f).\nHence, porosity values determined from single samples and the degree of alteration should not immediately be taken as indicators for the bands impact on fluid flow. It has been shown that porosity can be highly variable laterally within a band at a very local scale (Fossen and Bale, 2007; Torabi and Fossen, 2009). The degree of cataclasis, i.e. the main contributor to porosity reduction (e.g., Pittman, 1981; Antonellini et al., 1994; Ballas et al., 2015), is partially controlled by the host rock composition and grain properties, e.g. grain sorting, roundness, or mineralogy (e.g., Cheung et al., 2012; Exner and Tschegg, 2012; Skurtveit et al., 2013), which may have had an impact on the analyzed deformation bands. Still, the circumstance that the splay zones enclose unaltered host rock (Fig. 4c and d) highlights the potential of deformation bands to act as baffles to fluid flow.\nApart from the broader meter-scale control on host rock alteration that dominantly occurs in the footwall, the deformation bands exhibit a control at the cm-scale on alteration on both the hanging wall and footwall sides as indicated by the dark red-stained zones along them (Fig. 4d). As seen in the microscopic analysis, the coloration of this zone is caused by the dominant precipitation of Fe-\/Ti-oxides and jarosite. The occurrence of these precipitates along biotite flakes or in their close proximity suggests that they form products of its alteration (Bisdom et al., 1982; Morad, 1990; Li et al., 1998). To a minor degree, jarosite and Fe-\/Ti-oxides occur outside this zone, where they are mostly confined to parts of mica grains where the flakes have been delaminated. This expansion may have resulted from compaction where the mica grains are mechanically pressed against adjacent grains and subsequently increased the reaction surface for the mica alteration (Fig. 6f and g). An expansion of mica lamellae due to crystal growth in between is less likely as a main driver, since the space between the lamellae is frequently not filled, or only partially filled, with precipitates (Fig. 6g and h).\nDeformation bands are commonly surrounded by a thin envelope, i.e. a \u2018transition zone\u2019, where the degree of compaction is slightly higher than the host rock (e.g., Aydin, 1978; Underhill and Woodcock, 1987; Cavailhes and Rotevatn, 2018). Hence, in this zone, due to the increased compaction, biotite is folded and delaminated to a larger extent providing more reaction surface than in the host rock. Inside the deformation bands, biotite is crushed, however, and Fe-\/Ti-oxides and jarosite are nearly absent. This may be rooted in the permeability contrast with the deformation band being low-permeable, while in the surrounding transition zone, the pore space is still large enough to allow for fluid flux providing sufficient reactants for biotite alteration. Capillary effects may also favor fluid migration in the transition zone, rather in the host rock (Sigda and Wilson, 2003; Dimmen et al., 2020). The fact that along the bands of samples G-49 and G-50 the red-stained zone occurs on both sides of the band argues for a similar or the same fluid and a similar fluid circulation habit in the footwall and hanging wall of the bands.\n\n\n5.3\nVein structure\nThe overall N-NE trend of the veins is oblique to the NW-trending Dombjerg Fault, which may root in the proximity of the outcrop locations to the right-stepping transfer\/relay zone between the Dombjerg Fault and the Thomsen Land Fault (Figs. 1b and 2). In such a right-stepping setting, local stress perturbation and clockwise re-orientation of the principal stress axes is common (e.g., \u00c7ift\u00e7i and Bozkurt, 2007; Rotevatn and Bastesen, 2014; Mercuri et al., 2020), which may explain the overall trend of the veins. However, the setting is complicated by the circumstance that the majority of the veins formed in the post-rift stage in the Aptian\/Albian and it is inferred that the vein ages also reflect the time of fracturing (Salomon et al., 2020). Activity of the Dombjerg and Thomsen Land faults in the post-rift stage has not been reported. However, the presence of the transfer zone should still cause local stress perturbations and may therefore influence deformation in response to any regional tectonic activity (e.g., Kattenhorn et al., 2000). Nevertheless, as the vein density increases towards the Dombjerg Fault (Kristensen et al., 2016), activity of the fault also in the post-rift stage does seem plausible, albeit this cannot be independently confirmed by our data.\nAll veins of the hanging wall show at least one generation of syntaxial growth, which argues for a sudden rather than a creeping fracture opening (e.g., Bons et al., 2012). The series of crack-seal events visible in many veins indicate repetitive opening of the veins, albeit, given the width of the crack-seal generations, these latter fracture openings have never exceeded the initial fracture width. In conjunction with the occurrence of slip zones in some of the veins, this suggests that the initial site of fracturing had been preferential zones of weaknesses susceptible for further fracturing, which is a common observation (e.g., Ramsay, 1980; Petit et al., 1999). The low degree of twinning of the vein calcite indicates that the veins have not been subject to significant deformation or high temperatures after their formation (Burkhard, 1993).\n\n\n5.4\nMicrocrystalline calcite\nThe microcrystalline calcite is an intriguing vein infill that differs significantly from the common elongate\/blocky calcite crystal generations. From the observations in thin sections of the microcrystalline calcite-hosting veins (Figs. 9 and 10), the following interpretations can be drawn:\n\n\u2022\nThe prominent normal gradation in many fill generations (Figs. 10a,b,d,e) indicate that the components were in suspension in a fluid before being deposited (e.g., Amy et al., 2006). Normal gradation has also been reported from sand injectites and interpreted to result from settlement in a low-grain concentration fluid (Hubbard et al., 2007; Hurst et al., 2011). Microcrystalline calcite was not found as cement in the sandstone, indicating that this calcite precipitated from the fluid in the fracture. The appearance of microcrystalline calcite also distinguishes these structures from sand injectites, the latter not being associated with mineral precipitation. The circumstance that the clast infill is largely embedded in the microcrystalline calcite (Fig. 10) argues for a calcite precipitation predominantly prior to the settling of clasts.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe aligned generations of microcrystalline calcite parallel to the wall rock in sample G-9 (Fig. 10a) argue for a repetitive fracture opening with repetitive pulses of microcrystalline calcite precipitation. In sample G-37 (Fig. 10d), such alignment is missing, and generations are solely stacked on top of each other. Combined with the horizontal separation of elongate and microcrystalline calcite in vein G-13 (Fig. 10f), this indicates that the amount of microcrystalline calcite can be heterogeneously distributed within a fracture. A reason for this heterogeneity may be a variable fracture aperture and surface roughness of the fracture walls, which generally influence fluid flow velocities and causes non-linear to turbulent flow and may even create eddies (e.g., Wang et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2015). Subsequently, precipitates and particles that are in suspension may settle when being transported into sections of the fracture where low flow velocities prevail.\n\n\n\nMicrocrystalline calcite is a rather uncommon calcite texture and has rarely been described before in veins (Eichhubl and Boles, 1998, Bishop and Sumner, 2006; Hendry and Poulsom, 2006; Capezzuoli et al., 2018, as the only examples known to the authors of this contribution). Commonly, calcite preferably grows on nuclei and existing calcite crystals resulting in the formation of larger crystals (e.g., Bons et al., 2012). We therefore speculate that microcrystalline calcite may have formed in a setting of quick super-saturation that forced a sudden precipitation of calcite from the hosting fluid, preventing an organization of dissolved ions into larger crystals, as similarly proposed for the formation of microcrystalline quartz (Fournier, 1985; Onasch et al., 2010; Shimizu, 2014). A quick super-saturation may be caused by three mechanisms: a sudden pressure drop (e.g., He et al., 1999), a sudden rise of fluid temperature (calcite has a T retrograde solubility; e.g., Plummer and Busenberg, 1982), and fluid mixing (e.g., Tartakovsky et al., 2008).\nWe regard the influence of temperature as less likely, as we do not identify a heat source that could have caused a sudden local temperature rise. Fluid mixing, which has been considered by Bishop and Sumner (2006), appears plausible in the setting along the Dombjerg Fault, as a fluid in uncemented sediment enclosed by the cementation zone may have a different composition than a fluid outside the cementation zone. Fracturing of cemented layers may connect and mix these fluids causing calcite precipitation within the fracture. This may explain the occurrence of microcrystalline calcite only in fractures. After some time, fluids may reach equilibrium and calcite precipitation continues at a slower rate under normal advective conditions.\nPressure drop and corresponding CO2 degassing has been proposed as responsible for microcrystalline vein calcite (Eichhubl and Boles, 1998; Bishop and Sumner, 2006; Capezzuoli et al., 2018). Also, fault-induced pore pressure changes are suggested to be responsible for near-fault microcrystalline calcite in clastic sediments (Balsamo et al., 2012). As uncemented porous deposits are susceptible to mechanical compaction (e.g., Paxton et al., 2002), fluid pressure would generally build up in these sediments in response to progressive burial and if enclosed by the low-permeable cemented rock preventing a significant escape of the fluid (e.g., Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997). In addition, organic material degradation, which is regarded as source of carbon for the calcite cement and veins along the Dombjerg Fault (Salomon et al., 2020), would increase the CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) in these enclosed porous compartments (e.g., Schulz and Zabel, 2006). Both the increase of fluid pressure and pCO2 would act positively on the solubility of calcite (e.g., Stumm and Morgan, 1996; Coto et al., 2012).\nIf the sealing cemented layer covering the uncemented compartments is breached by a fracture, the overpressured fluid would flow into the fracture and be subject to a sudden fluid pressure and pCO2 drop within the fracture (Sibson et al., 1988). In addition, if the fracture acts as a narrow pathway that connects two uncemented compartments, fluid pressure should be lower within the fracture than in the compartments above and below the fracture (\u201cVenturi effect\u201d; see e.g., Furbish, 1997; Zhang, 2017). Both mechanisms favor sudden super-saturation within the fracture, leading to quick precipitation of calcite; they may also serve as an explanation for the preferred occurrence of microcrystalline calcite in the fracture and its absence in the pore space of the surrounding host rocks.\nCarbon isotopes of vein calcite shed light on the conditions during calcite precipitation. \u03b413C of calcite is dependent on the temperature-sensitive carbon isotope fractionation between CO2(g) and calcite (Romanek et al., 1992), which leads to an enrichment of 13C in calcite compared to parent fluid CO2. In case of a fast pressure drop, CO2 degassing would result in a kinetic fractionation and further enrichment of 13C in calcite (e.g. Usdowski et al., 1979; Kele et al., 2011).\nKnowing the precipitation temperature of calcite, the carbon isotopic composition of parent fluid CO2 can be calculated using the fractionation equation of Romanek et al. (1992). The formation temperature of a microcrystalline calcite vein was determined as \u223c40\u00a0\u00b0C (sample G10v1 of Salomon et al., 2020). Using this estimate and an average \u03b413CVPDB of \u221214.8\u2030 for the microcrystalline calcite (Table 2), a \u03b413CVPDB value of \u221222.0\u2030 is calculated for parent fluid CO2. In comparison, carbon isotopes of blocky calcite veins that precipitated at similar temperatures of \u223c36\u201347\u00a0\u00b0C (i.e. samples G-4, G-36v1, G-40, TBK1 of Salomon et al., 2020) yield a range of \u03b413CVPDB \u221223.5 to \u221219.0\u2030 (average \u221221.2\u2030). This translates into an average \u03b413CVPDB of \u221228.0\u2030 for fluid CO2, which is 6.0\u2030 lighter compared to the value of \u221222.0\u2030 obtained from the microcrystalline calcite generations. A fluid CO2 \u03b413CVPDB value of \u221228.0\u2030 is in good agreement with the carbon isotopic composition of organic carbon between \u221231 and \u221227.5\u2030 measured on mid-Volgian\/Ryazanian deposits in the study region (Pauly et al., 2013; Koevoets et al., 2018; Jelby et al., 2020), i.e. the time of deposition of the Lindemans Bugt Formation. This (a) supports the interpretation of Salomon et al. (2020) that CO2 from the degradation of organic matter was the main carbon source and (b) suggests that the blocky calcite veins formed in near-isotopic equilibrium with fluid CO2. Further, the significantly higher \u03b413C of microcrystalline calcite argues for kinetic isotope fractionation during CO2 degassing and rapid calcite precipitation.\nIn summary, for the formation of these veins, we propose a model starting with a tectonic fracture opening (Fig. 11\na) indicated by the overall parallel orientation of fractures. Overpressured fluid would inject into the fracture, and the accompanied fluid pressure drop and sudden supersaturation of the fluid in the fracture would force the precipitation of calcite. The energy of the injected fluid would be sufficiently large to carry sediment grains from the uncemented bodies into the fracture. Grains may have also trickled down into the fracture from a potentially overlying uncemented sediment bed or derived from the immediate cemented wall rocks. The latter seems less likely as a significant contributor though, as the fracture walls are rather smooth with cut-off grains, and there is no evidence to support grain fall-out from fracture wall, apart from larger rock fragments. Upon reduction of fluid overpressure, clasts and calcite crystals settle in a normal grading manner (Fig. 11b). Fluid flow within a fracture is often non-linear and may even be turbulent (e.g., Wang et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2015) giving rise to an unequal deposition of grains, rock fragments and precipitating microcrystalline calcite within the fracture (Fig. 11b and c). The existence of multiple fracture fill generations indicates a cyclicity in their formation. The settling of microcrystalline calcite from suspension may seal the fracture allowing a renewed buildup of fluid pressure in the underlying sediment. Hydraulic (Fig. 11c) or tectonic (Fig. 11d) fracturing would allow the repetitive injection of fluid into the fracture with the corresponding pressure release and microcrystalline calcite precipitation. At moderate fluid pressure and saturation, the formation of blocky calcite would commence in the fracture (Fig. 11e and f).\n\n\n\n6\nSummary and conclusions\nActivity of the Dombjerg Fault and the connected formation of a cementation zone in its proximity (Kristensen et al., 2016; Salomon et al., 2020) has created an environment that showcases, on a microstructural scale, the interaction of sediment diagenesis, tectonic-controlled deformation, and fluid chemistry and flow in clastic rocks along rift-bounded fault systems. By studying the contrasting deformation regimes inside and outside the cementation zone, respectively, we reach the following conclusions regarding the interplay between deformation, fluid flow and diagenesis that followed after the establishment of the fault-proximal cementation zone:\n\n\u2022\nIn the uncemented zones, deformation bands are the common deformation feature, and are characterized by a cataclastic reduction in grain size, which have led to a reduction in porosity and, likely, permeability, within the bands.\n\n\n\u2022\nAlteration at and around the deformation bands indicate that the bands acted as partial baffles to fluid flow and resulted in localized host rock alterations, promoting further chemical reduction of porosity.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn near-impermeable cemented deposits, discrete brittle fractures (veins) are the common deformation features. Microstructuraly, the veins show at least one generation of syntaxial growth, and a series of crack-seal is evident in many veins, indicating repetitive opening and cementation.\n\n\n\u2022\nBased on our observations, we suggest the veins comprising microcrystalline calcite formed by rapid precipitation during repetitive fracture opening and injection of fluids. These fluids likely derive from overpressured uncemented deposit compartments that have been enclosed by cemented sediment.\n\n\n\nThese observations highlight how a fault-controlled calcite cementation zone is able to compartmentalize a syn-rift sedimentary basin into different regimes of fluid flow and deformation. Within fault-proximal cementation zones, fluid flow through pores in the matrix becomes low to negligible where cementation is pervasive, and fluid flow becomes increasingly dependent on flow through fractures. Outside the zone of fault-proximal pervasive cementation, fluid flow predominantly happens as flow in the matrix porosity (e.g. in the pore space between clastic grains. Understanding this duality in the porosity\/fluid flow and deformation regime has important implications for predicting flow patterns, for example in connection with the assessment and planning of potential CO2 storage, hydrocarbon exploration and production, groundwater aquifers, and geothermal sites (e.g., placement of well sites). It further demonstrates that understanding the interplay between diagenesis, deformation and fluid flow during the evolution of fault-bounded basins is critical, and must be taken into account when evaluating basin histories for a range of applications.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nAll authors conducted the field data collection, rock sampling, data evaluation, manuscript reviewing and editing.

Previous studies suggest that the geometry, kinematics and dynamics of salt tectonics in FTBs are mainly controlled by salt distribution, salt thickness, syntectonic sedimentation and basement structures (e.g., basement fault, ramp and paleo-uplift) (Stewart, 1996; Cotton and Koyi, 2000; Costa and Vendeville, 2002; Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003; Konstantinosvskaya et al., 2009; Vidal-Royo et al., 2009; Ter Borgh et al., 2011; Farzipour-Saein et al., 2013; Fillon et al., 2013; Farzipour-Saein and Koyi, 2014; Wu et al., 2014; Faisal and Dixon, 2015; Farzipour-Saein, 2017; Rosas et al., 2017; Borderie et al., 2018; Pla et al., 2019). The basement structures include base-salt relief that developed due to folding and faulting that is also named as paleo-uplift (Wang et al., 2016). In nature, paleo-uplifts are commonly observed in sub-salt layers of FTB, which may have experienced multiple tectonic movements that formed the current structural characteristics (Xu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016, 2019; Gao et al., 2017). The formation and evolution of paleo-uplift are mainly controlled by its genetic mechanism (e.g., extensional environment, convergent environment or strike-slipping environment) (Fig. 1\n), leading to the presence of persistent paleo-highs in topography (Jackson and Lewis, 2016; Neng et al., 2016; Escosa et al., 2018; He, 2018; Pichel et al., 2019). Due to the difference in tectonic deformation and the later tectonic movement, the amplitude of paleo-uplift varies across the basin. Recent studies suggest that paleo-uplift plays an important role in controlling hydrocarbon generation and migration (Lin et al., 2009, 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2017). However, most of the previous studies of the influence of paleo-uplift on salt tectonics are in the context of passive margin setting (Dooley and Hudec, 2017; Dooley et al., 2017; Pichel et al., 2019) where deformations are predominately driven by gravity loading of sedimentary successions. Although there are some studies of paleo-uplift on structural evolution of salt-bearing sedimentary basins in a contraction setting (e.g., Z. Wu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Dooley et al., 2018; Hudec et al., 2021), the significance of paleo-uplift amplitude on salt flow and structural deformation of supra-detachment layers remains to be explored in detail.\nIn this paper, physical modeling was used to investigate the influence of sub-salt paleo-uplift on salt tectonics of fold-and-thrust belt (FTB) by systematically changing the amplitude of paleo-uplift. Our goals with these models were to test (1) the influence of paleo-uplift amplitude on deformation propagation, and (2) the influence of paleo-uplift amplitude on salt structure. The final experimental results were compared with natural examples of Kuqa FTB to explain how the variable paleo-uplift influences the deformation of supra-salt layers of the Qiulitage structural belt.\n\n\n2\nExperimental method\nPhysical modeling has long been used to investigate the deformation mechanisms of FTBs as a powerful tool to evaluate and simulate the kinematics, mechanics and dynamic processes of natural geological structures (Hall, 1815; Hubbert, 1951; McClay and Ellis, 1987; Koyi, 1997; Corti, 2008; Graveleau et al., 2012). We conducted four series of physical models to explore the effect of variable paleo-uplift on salt tectonics of salt-bearing FTBs. Details of the models are listed as the following:\n\n2.1\nExperiment material and scaling\nThe experimental models consist of three materials that simulate different lithologies of rocks in the salt-bearing FTB, including: (1) quartz sand, simulating the frictional behavior of the brittle sedimentary rocks; (2) glass microbeads, simulating the frictional brittle d\u00e9collement; (3) silicone, simulating the viscous salt layers. Dry quartz sand, following Mohr-Coulomb rupture criteria, is an ideal material to simulate the deformation in the upper brittle crust (Lohrmann et al., 2003; Klinkm\u00fcller et al., 2016). In our experimental models, the artificially dyed green sand was used as the marker layer to monitor the deformation. The sand maintained similar mechanical properties to white sand, which had a cohesion of approximately 100\u2013150\u00a0Pa and coefficient of internal friction of approximately 0.65\u20130.75 (Table 1\n). Glass microbeads are used to simulate weak brittle strata such as mudstones, shales and other brittle d\u00e9collements (Klinkm\u00fcller et al., 2016). The glass microbeads we used to model the basal d\u00e9collement had a diameter of about 200\u00a0\u03bcm and an internal friction angle of about 26\u00b0. Silicone with a Newtonian linear viscous behavior at low strain rates is a transparent and high-viscosity polydimethylsiloxane polymer, and has been commonly used to model ductile sequences in the upper crust (Weijermars et al., 1993). The density of the silicone used in experimental models was 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0kg\/m3 and the viscosity was 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0Pa.\u00a0s at room temperature.\nIn order to simulate the kinematics and geometries of thrust structures, physical modeling should follow the principles of geometric, kinematic and dynamic similarities (Hubbert, 1937). In our experimental models, 1\u00a0cm represents 1\u00a0km in nature. The geometric similarity is 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 based on the length scaling ratio L* (Table 1). The dynamic similarity of the experiments can be expressed by \u03c3*\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c1*g*L*, where the average density ratio \u03c1* is 0.5, gravity acceleration ratio g* is 1, as experimental models were carried out under normal gravity. Therefore, the stress ratio \u03c3* is 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126. As for the kinematic similarity, the strain-rate ratio \u03b5* should be calculated, which can be obtained from \u03b5*\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3*\/\u03b7*. We used an average dynamic viscosity for salt layers of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01019\u00a0Pa.\u00a0s (Van Keken et al., 1993) and silicone polymer of 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0Pa.\u00a0s, getting a viscosity ratio \u03b7* 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221215 (Table 1). From the stress ratio \u03c3* and the viscosity ratio \u019e*, the strain-rate ratio \u03b5* is 2.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109. The time ratio t* which is the inverse of \u03b5*, is 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210, meaning that 1\u00a0h in the laboratory represents about 260,000 years in nature. Our experiments lasted 18.5\u00a0h, which equal to 4.8 Myr of geological time. Finally, the scaling ratio for velocity V* is calculated as V*\u00a0=\u00a0L*\/t*\u00a0=\u00a02.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104. Considering the shortening-rate ratio, the shortening rate in our models was 0.003\u00a0mm\/s, which is equivalent to 4.1\u00a0mm\/year in nature.\n\n\n2.2\nExperiment setup\nA schematic diagram of experimental models is shown in Fig. 2\n. The experimental apparatus consisted of a fixed rigid basal plate, a mobile backstop, a fixed wall and two fixed glass sidewalls. The basal plate was flat and made of PVC. The coefficient of basal friction (\u03bcb) was estimated to be about 0.35. The mobile backstop was driven by an electric motor, which was pushed at a constant rate of 0.003\u00a0mm\/s. The internal dimension (length\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0width\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0height) of the experimental apparatus was 80\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0cm. The total shortening of each experiment was kept the same at 20\u00a0cm in order to compare the results of all models. The experimental design parameters are outlined in Table 2\n.\nThe model setup was made of a four-layer brittle-ductile system, from bottom to top: 0.5\u00a0cm of glass microbeads, 1.0\u00a0cm of quartz sand, 1.5\u00a0cm of transparent silicone and 2.0\u00a0cm of quartz sand (Fig. 2b). The basal glass microbeads and interbedded silicone represented two d\u00e9collement layers in the salt-bearing FTB, and the sand layers represented brittle formations. The paleo-uplift was simulated by shaping the quartz sand into arc form with different amplitude. Particularly, we changed the height of paleo-uplift and constrained the distribution range of paleo-uplift (40\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0cm, length\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0width) to exhibit the variation process of paleo-uplift amplitude. The distance between the center of paleo-uplift and the initial mobile backstop was kept at 50\u00a0cm in all models. The height of the paleo-uplift in Model 1 to Model 4 changed from 0\u00a0cm to 1.5\u00a0cm with an interval of 0.5\u00a0cm, and the ratio of paleo-uplift height (Hp) to upper d\u00e9collement thickness (Hd) changed accordingly (Table 2). In this paper, Hp\/Hd\u00a0=\u00a01\/3 was defined as low amplitude paleo-uplift, Hp\/Hd\u00a0=\u00a02\/3 was defined as medium amplitude paleo-uplift, and Hp\/Hd\u00a0=\u00a01 was defined as high amplitude paleo-uplift.\nTectonic thickening increases dramatically with increasing ramp angle during deformation transport from the flat to the ramp (Koyi and Maillot, 2007). In order to reduce the influence of the ramp angle on the structural deformation, the updip angle of paleo-uplift was controlled within 20\u00b0 during the laying process. All models were repeated twice under the same conditions to confirm the reliability of experimental results. There is a high degree of similarity of experimental results between the same models. Experimental results show that although the glass sidewalls in our experiments have been cleaned thoroughly, the boundary friction along the sidewalls cannot be totally avoided, resulting in the arcuate fault planes in map view. Considering the same effect of boundary friction in all models, the measurement of shallow deformation front position was taken 20\u00a0cm away from the sidewalls to reduce the effect of sidewall friction.\n\n\n2.3\nQuantitative measurements\nThe experimental models were photographed throughout the experiment at an interval of 5\u00a0min to observe the structural deformation. Top view photographs were used to quantitatively monitor the propagation of the shallow deformation front position (relative to the initial position of the mobile backstop). Side-view photographs were used to monitor the internal deformation of the models during the contraction (see more photographs in supplementary data).\nA Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) device with data processing software MicroVec V3, was used to track the sand movement and to calculate the grain velocity (V) and horizontal strain (EXX) during the deformation. PIV is a measurement technique that provides accurate measure of the instantaneous velocity\/displacement field of laboratory flow and deformation systems and has been widely used in physical modeling to monitor tectonic deformation (Adam et al., 2005; Cruz et al., 2008; J. Wu et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016; Jagger and McClay, 2016; Sun et al., 2016). In our experiments, the PIV device recorded the velocity field in the same top view images as that captured in photography, with a calculated interval of 300\u00a0s.\nAt the end of the experiment, each model was wetted and cut the dip section at every 5\u00a0cm to observe the internal deformations. These isometric cross-sections were used to observe lateral variation of structures and to count the position of deep deformation front at the final shortening. Besides, three representative cross-sections with the same spacing in each model were selected to measure the final topographic slopes and to illustrate the final stage of each experiment.\n\n\n\n3\nExperimental results\nIn the four experiments, kinematic evolution was illustrated by five top view images with incremental shortening (5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%) and three cross-sections at the final shortening. PIV analysis including the analysis of sand grain velocity (V) and horizontal strain (EXX) was used to track tectonic deformation. Besides, PIV results showed the plane distribution of V and EXX in the same shortening as five top view images. In order to compare sand grain moving velocity and horizontal strain of all models, the maximum speed is set at 0.003\u00a0mm\/s and the minimum horizontal strain is \u22120.15 in all models.\n\n3.1\nModel 1 (Hp\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0cm)\nModel 1 is a reference model with no paleo-uplift. Fig. 3\na shows five stages of progressive development of Model 1. At the beginning of deformation, faults propagated forward along the basal d\u00e9collement and was mainly concentrated near the mobile backstop. At 3% shortening, a back-thrust B1 was developed in the shallow d\u00e9collement and formed the passive roof duplex in front of the mobile wall. As the shortening continued, the fore-thrust F1 was developed on the east side of the model. When shortening reached up to 10%, the deformation of supra-salt layers propagated forward along the upper viscous d\u00e9collement and the back-thrust B2 formed in the foreland. With increased shortening up to 14%, the fore-thrust F2 was developed in front of the fault B2. At 19% shortening, fore-thrust F3 and back-thrust B3 formed at the same time. At the final shortening (25%), a low amplitude detachment fold was developed in the foreland with fore-thrust F4 and back-thrust B4. From the final cross-sections of Model 1 (Fig. 3b), the deformation along the basal frictional d\u00e9collement was characterized by the imbrication of thrust sheets and was mainly localized in the hinterland. However, the deformation along the upper viscous d\u00e9collement exhibited different patterns of folding with fore-thrusts and back-thrusts, and these fore-thrusts accommodate less displacement than the long-time active back-thrusts.\nPIV analysis of Model 1 (Fig. 4\n) reveals that the boundary of maximum sand grain velocity is always the concentrated area of horizontal strain. And the position of minimum horizontal strain in each stage is the position of back-thrust in Model 1.\n\n\n3.2\nModel 2 (Hp\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0cm)\nModel 2 has low amplitude paleo-uplift, in which the ratio of paleo-uplift height to upper d\u00e9collement thickness is 1\/3. The progressive evolution of Model 2 is shown for five stages (Fig. 5\na). At the beginning of deformation, faults development was almost similar to that of Model 1, and a back-thrust B1 was developed in front of the mobile wall. As the shortening continued (10%), no new fault formed in top view. Only when shortening exceeded 13%, the fore-thrust F1 formed in the foreland. Subsequently, the deformation front propagated forward to the updip side of the paleo-uplift at the shortening of 18%. Besides, the fore-thrust F2 and back-thrust B2 formed in the foreland almost simultaneously. When the shortening reached up to 25%, the back-thrust B3 was developed on the downdip side of paleo-uplift and a low amplitude detachment fold was developed in front of the FTB. In addition, the final cross-sections of Model 2 show that the deformation styles were the same as those of Model 1. And the pre-exiting paleo-uplift resulted in the salt accumulation on the top of paleo-uplift (Fig. 5b).\nAccording to PIV analysis of Model 2 (Fig. 6\n), the boundary where sand velocity decreases sharply is the concentrated area of horizontal strain. Besides, the position of minimum horizontal strain moves forward with the position of deformation front in the process of deformation.\n\n\n3.3\nModel 3 (Hp\u00a0=\u00a01.0\u00a0cm)\nModel 3 is an experimental model in which the ratio of paleo-uplift height to upper d\u00e9collement thickness is 2\/3. The progressive evolution of Model 3 is shown in Fig. 7\na. At 3% shortening, the back-thrust B1 formed in front of the mobile backstop. With increased shortening, the fore-thrust F1 was developed and formed a pop-up structure with back-thrust B1. When the shortening reached up to 10%, the fore-thrust F2 and F3 formed sequentially in the foreland direction. Subsequently, a new pop-up structure was formed with fore-thrust F3 and back-thrust B2. As shortening advanced to 15%, the back-thrust B3 formed on the updip side of paleo-uplift. Then the deformation of supra-salt layers propagated forward along the upper viscous d\u00e9collement. At 25% shortening, the fore-thrust F4 formed on the downdip side of paleo-uplift. On the basis of the final cross-sections of model 3 (Fig. 7b), a low amplitude detachment fold developed in front of the FTB. Besides, the salt was concentrated on the top of paleo-uplift, which resulted in the uplift of supra-salt layers.\nThe results of PIV analysis show that the position of horizontal strain has the similarity with Model 2, and the position of minimum horizontal strain moves forward with the position of deformation front at each stage (Fig. 8\n).\n\n\n3.4\nModel 4 (Hp\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0cm)\nModel 4 has high amplitude paleo-uplift, in which the height of the paleo-uplift is equal to the thickness of the upper d\u00e9collement. Fig. 9\na shows five stages of the progressive evolution of Model 4. At the beginning of deformation, faults development was similar to the previous models. At 2% shortening, the back-thrust B1 developed on the shallow d\u00e9collement. As the shortening continues to increase with no new fault formed in top view. When shortening reached up to 11%, the deformation of supra-salt layers propagated rapidly toward the paleo-uplift. The fore-thrust F1 and back-thrust B2 were formed on the top of paleo-uplift. Almost at the same time, the fore-thrust F2 formed between the paleo-uplift and mobile backstop. As shortening proceeded (18%), the back-thrust B3 formed near the fault F2. When the shortening reached up to 25%, the deformation propagated forward across the paleo-uplift, and the back-thrust B4 was formed in the foreland. In Fig. 9b, the deformation styles of the basal and shallow d\u00e9collements are the same as the previous models even if in this case there is more rock salt feeding into the fold over the paleo-uplift.\nBased on the results of PIV analysis of Model 4 (Fig. 10\n), the boundary of maximum sand grain velocity is always concentrated on the position of F2 or B3 except for stage 1 and 2. And the position of minimum horizontal strain is always the boundary where sand velocity rapidly decreases.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nInfluence of paleo-uplift amplitude on deformation propagation\nIn our experimental models, the paleo-uplift is located below the shallow d\u00e9collement. In order to analyze the deformation propagation of the two d\u00e9collement layers, the deep deformation front was counted by determining the final position of deep imbricated thrust tip in serial isometric cross-sections spaced at 5\u00a0cm. The shallow deformation front is constrained by the position of active fault tip at the final shortening of experimental models. According to the central cross-section of experimental models, Fig. 11\n shows that the distance between the deep deformation front and the initial position of the mobile backstop is concentrated in a range of 35\u201340\u00a0cm. That is to say, the presence or absence of paleo-uplift or the change of paleo-uplift amplitude have no significant impact on the deep deformations below the shallow ductile detachment consisting of salt. The decoupling of supra-salt and sub-salt deformations indicates that ductile d\u00e9collement exerted a fundamental control on the development of FTB in salt-bearing foreland basins.\nThe position of shallow deformation front varied significantly with the presence of paleo-uplift. In Model 1 (no paleo-uplift), the maximum deformation front in the supra-salt overburden propagated forward to 65.5\u00a0cm, which is much far distance than the other three models with pre-existing paleo-uplift. The presence of paleo-uplift localizes shortening strain in the proximal and central parts of the models and deters rapid deformation propagation toward the distal part. To analyze the influence of paleo-uplift amplitude on the shallow deformation front, the deformation front position (relative to the initial position of mobile backstop) was plotted to show the relationship between the shallow deformation position and amount of shortening of each model (Fig. 12\n). The evolution of shallow deformation front indicates that the presence of paleo-uplift has a controlling effect on the position of deformation front, leading to the deformation front constrained to the distribution range of paleo-uplift, at about 55\u00a0cm. In particular, the shallow deformation front of Model 4 (high amplitude paleo-uplift) reached the paleo-uplift faster than other models during compression.\n\nWang et al. (2016) proposed that the presence of paleo-uplift beneath upper d\u00e9collement resulted in the fault slipping along the d\u00e9collement and breaking through above the paleo-uplift rapidly. Moreover, the model results of Wang et al. (2016) show that the deformation terminates at the position of paleo-uplift. It's worth noting that the height of paleo-uplift of experimental modes is larger than the thickness of the upper d\u00e9collement, forming the welding point with the upper d\u00e9collement. Conversely, in our models, the height of the paleo-uplift is less than or equal to the thickness of the upper d\u00e9collement. Only the deformation front of Model 4, which has the height of the paleo-uplift equivalent to the thickness of the shallow d\u00e9collement, propagates to the paleo-uplift in a relatively short time. Based on the serial cross-sections in Model 4 (Fig. 9b), although the front fault developed on the downdip side of paleo-uplift, the deformation has passed through the paleo-uplift and formed the detachment fold in the foreland direction, which is different from the model results of Wang et al. (2016). According to the model results of Wang et al. (2016) and the experimental results in this paper, it can be found that when the height of the paleo-uplift equals or exceeds the thickness of the upper d\u00e9collement, the paleo-uplift provides a welding point for the upper d\u00e9collement, leading to the faster propagation of the deformation along the shallow d\u00e9collement.\nIn summary, the presence of paleo-uplift fundamentally controls the way of deformation propagation in the supra-salt overburden during the contraction. This is evidenced by the deformation patterns in Model 1 and Models 2\u20134. Model 1 is characterized by progressive fault propagation from hinterland to foreland with sequentially developed fold and fault belts migrating towards the distal part of the model. In Models 2\u20134, however, the presence of paleo-uplift localizes the shortening over the sub-salt high where box-folding with double-verging faults (Model 2) and back-thrusting and associated salt-cored anticlines (Model 3 and Model 4). The amplitude of paleo-uplift also has a significant impact on the deformation of supra-salt overburden. As the amplitude of paleo-uplift increases, the controlling effect of paleo-uplift on deformation propagation becomes stronger. If the height of the paleo-uplift equals or exceeds the thickness of the upper d\u00e9collement, the deformation will rapidly reach the paleo-uplift. Further deformation of the supra-salt strata occurred in an out-of-sequence fashion, as we can see that the deformation migrated inward to the area between the mobile backstop and the paleo-uplift before new faults development beyond the paleo-uplift. This difference of deformation pattern with variable paleo-uplift amplitude may be the result of salt distribution and salt flow. The absence of rock salt above the paleo-uplift in Model 4 promotes accelerated strain localization on the updip side of the paleo-uplift, which favorably generates fold belt at this point. The development of fold and fault belt over the paleo-uplift may serve as a stress buttress to the contraction, which leads to inward deformation propagation and fault development towards the hinterland.\n\n\n4.2\nInfluence of paleo-uplift amplitude on salt structure\n\nFig. 13\n shows the central cross-sections of each model by photographs and line-drawing interpretations, respectively. The deformation of salt layers among the four experimental models is significantly different at the final shortening. In Model 1, a small amount of salt accumulated in the core of the fold and salt weld developed between the sub-salt stacked fault sheets and the supra-salt layers (Fig. 13a and e). Considering the presence of paleo-uplift, the result of Model 2 shows that salt accumulated on the top of paleo-uplift, forming a box fold. Similarly, salt weld developed in the hinterland (Fig. 13b and f). Model 3 shows that salt weld developed on the downdip side of paleo-uplift. Compared with Model 2, more salt accumulated on the top of paleo-uplift (Fig. 13c and g). In the Model 4, the development of salt structure is similar to Model 3, but the increase of paleo-uplift amplitude leads to the increase of rock salt and the formation of more developed salt-cored thrust over the paleo-uplift (Fig. 13d and h).\nObviously, the development position of salt weld changes with the increase of paleo-uplift amplitude (Fig. 13). The low amplitude paleo-uplift makes salt weld more likely to develop in the hinterland close to the mobile backstop. In contrast, salt weld always occurs on the downdip side of higher amplitude paleo-uplift. This phenomenon can be explained as the effect of paleo-uplift on the flow of rock salt. As mentioned above, the presence of paleo-uplift leads to the accumulation of rock salt on the top of paleo-uplift. And higher amplitude paleo-uplift would have a better blocking effect on the forward flow of rock salt, leading to the large-scale accumulation of salt volume between the paleo-uplift and the mobile backstop. Particularly, the wedge taper in the final cross-sections (Fig. 13) indicates that Model 1 has a significantly higher wedge taper than the other models, which may be caused by the thickening and uplift of supra-salt layers over the paleo-uplift. The uplift of supra-salt layers is the result of salt flow or salt fed into the fold and fault belt over the paleo-uplift, which becomes amplified with continued deformation. It is similar to the previous studies that the basement ramp leads to the thickening of the overlying strata (Bonini et al., 2000; Maillot and Koyi, 2006; Koyi and Maillot, 2007). Similar observation of localized deformation due to the presence of paleo-uplift height and the salt thickness changes has been observed in physical modeling of Dooley et al., (2017), Dooley and Hudec (2017, 2020).\n\n\n4.3\nComparison to examples from Kuqa FTB, Western China\n\n4.3.1\nGeological setting of the Kuqa FTB\nThe Kuqa FTB (this article refers specifically to the western Kuqa FTB) is dominated by south-verging folds and thrusts developed in the Southern Tian Shan orogen (Fig. 14\n). It is classically divided, from north to south, into the Northern structural belt, Kelasu structural belt, Qiulitage structural belt and Kalayuergun structural belt (Lu et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Wen et al., 2017; Izquierdo-Llavall et al., 2018). There are two d\u00e9collement layers in the Kuqa FTB: first, the coal layers of upper Triassic\u2013lower Jurassic, and second, the evaporates of Paleogene Kumugeliemu Group. Particularly, the structures of the Kuqa FTB could be divided into supra-salt structures and sub-salt structures due to the presence of evaporates (Fig. 15\n). The sub-salt structures are interpreted as imbricate thrust structures along the basal coal layers, which had an impact on the southward propagation of deformation along the shallow evaporates. Whereas, complex salt structures (e.g., salt-cored anticline, salt diapir and salt nappe), developed in the supra-salt layers.\nIn seismic profiles, Xiqiu paleo-uplift has been identified in the southern margin of the Kuqa FTB (Fig. 15). In the western Qiulitage structural belt, Xiqiu paleo-uplift has a wavelength of 30\u00a0km and a height of about 2\u00a0km (Fig. 15a); in the eastern Qiulitage structural belt, the Xiqiu paleo-uplift has a wavelength of about 16\u00a0km and a height of about 5\u00a0km (Fig. 15b). The localization of Xiqiu paleo-uplift in the western and eastern Qiulitage structural belt occurred at the same position as the salt diapirs and the associated anticline deformations. Previous study and residual gravity anomaly map of the Kuqa FTB verify that the amplitude of Xiqiu paleo-uplift varies along the strike (Yu et al., 2015; Neng et al., 2018). The salt structures at the top of Xiqiu paleo-uplift are obviously different along the strike of Xiqiu paleo-uplift. Yang et al. (2017) suggested that Xiqiu paleo-uplift influenced the development of salt structures in the Kuqa FTB. However, the influence of Xiqiu paleo-uplift amplitude on salt structures of Kuqa FTB remains to be further investigated.\n\n\n4.3.2\nComparison with the Kuqa FTB\nTwo structural sections of Kuqa FTB are selected as natural examples to compare with our experimental models. In this context, the western and eastern of Xiqiu paleo-uplift represent low amplitude paleo-uplift and high amplitude paleo-uplift, which are compared with Model 2 and Model 4, respectively (Figs. 16 and 17\n\n). Among them, Fig. 16 shows that salt structures, including Quele salt nappe and Misikantake salt-cored anticline, developed over the western Xiqiu paleo-uplift. A salt-cored box fold developed over the low amplitude paleo-uplift in Model 2. Besides, a lasting active fault developed at the boundary of box fold in Model 2 is similar to the deformation of Quele fault. Thus, there is a similarity of salt-related deformation between the western section and Model 2. In eastern case study and Model 4, the most obvious structures are salt-cored anticlines and salt diapir, which are linked to the sub-salt paleo-uplift (Fig. 17). Likewise, a huge amount of rock salt feeds into the Qiulitage anticline in Kuqa FTB and thrust zone in Model 4, localizing shortening strain over the paleo-uplift. One notable difference between the eastern section and Model 4 is the shape of salt-cored anticline over the paleo-uplift, which may be attributed to the lack of syntectonic sedimentation in Model 4. Previous studies verified that syntectonic sedimentation has played an important role in the structural evolution of the Kuqa FTB (Wu et al., 2014; Pla et al., 2019). Whereas syntectonic sedimentation has not been modeled in our models, this should be considered to moderate the comparison of experimental results with natural examples.\nAccording to the above analysis, significant accumulation of rock salt caused by paleo-uplift is seen in example sections and experimental results, indicating that Xiqiu paleo-uplift acts as a weak stress zone in the deformation process. In increase of paleo-uplift amplitude and strong deformation in the eastern part of Kuqa fold belt compared to the western part can be favorably explained by larger amounts of salt fed into the anticline deformation over larger paleo-uplift that further localize shortening.\n\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nOur experimental models investigate the influence of paleo-uplift amplitude on structural deformations in the salt-bearing fault-and-thrust belt (FTB). We conducted four series of physical models and compared the experimental results with the Kuqa FTB to provide insights for the influences of paleo-uplift amplitude on the deformation of salt-bearing FTB. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows:\n\n(1)\nThe presence of paleo-uplift has a profound impact on deformation propagation in the supra-salt overburden during the contraction, which localizes shortening strain in the proximal and central parts of the models and deters rapid deformation propagation toward the distal part. As the amplitude of paleo-uplift increases, the influence of paleo-uplift on deformation propagation becomes stronger, resulting in out-of-sequence deformation towards the hinterland.\n\n\n(2)\nThe increase of paleo-uplift amplitude controls the distribution and migration of rock salt during the contraction. When the paleo-uplift height equals or exceeds the thickness of salt layer, the position of salt pinch-out or welding point localizes shortening strain and thereby initiates folding and thrusting deformations over the salt-base high. Salt thickening, as a result of material flow into the anticline or thrust zone, further amplifies the deformation over the paleo-uplift, leading to the formation of salt diapir and salt-cored thrust.\n\n\n(3)\nOur modeling results favorably explain salt-influenced deformations in the Kuqa FTB, which shows that Xiqiu paleo-uplift acts as a weak stress zone in the deformation process, resulting in localized deformation and salt thickening in the core of the Qiulitage structural belt.\n\n\n\n\n","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":"","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"","107":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nIgneous intrusions are present in many sedimentary basins around the world. Their potential effects on geological processes and properties in the subsurface are widely recognized both on the local and regional scale. These effects include for instance accelerated chemical reactions (e.g. organic matter maturation) in the surrounding metamorphosed host rock and altered hydraulic properties, with consequences for groundwater exploration, CO2 sequestration and petroleum systems (Schutter, 2003; Senger et al., 2017), but also global climate change in the geological past (Iyer et al., 2017; Svensen et al., 2004).\nWith respect to fluid flow, igneous intrusions may act as barriers (Rateau et al., 2013), or alternatively, preferred pathways or even reservoirs (Mao et al., 2020; Rodriguez Monreal et al., 2009; Senger et al., 2015; Spacapan et al., 2020a), and may thus be of great importance for basin-scale flow patterns and hydrocarbon accumulations. Due to the typically low primary porosity of intrusions, fracturing represents a key factor controlling the overall hydraulic properties of igneous intrusions (Heap and Kennedy, 2016; Senger et al., 2017; Witte et al., 2012). Specifically for igneous intrusions acting as hydrocarbon reservoirs, fracture networks represent the main contributors to both porosity and permeability that allow storage and production in the first place (Delpino and Berm\u00fadez, 2009; Senger et al., 2017). However, there is no consensus on the relative importance of different fracturing mechanisms for establishing pathways or storage capacity for fluids, or their effect on quantifiable fracture network properties.\nCooling joints constitute the most obvious element of the fracture network in igneous intrusions and are commonly believed to provide most of the fracture porosity and permeability in intrusions (Delpino and Berm\u00fadez, 2009; Gudmundsson and L\u00f8tveit, 2014; Witte et al., 2012). Additionally, qualitative fracture evolution models often propose that fault-related fracturing and re-opening of cooling joints, as well as hydrothermal veins may enhance permeability (Spacapan et al., 2020a; Witte et al., 2012). Hydraulic fracturing due to fast maturation of organic-rich shales surrounding igneous intrusions is a well-recognized process (Aarnes et al., 2012; Zanella et al., 2015), but the potential fracturing of the intrusions themselves has been largely ignored. Although these existing models generally seem reasonable, there is an acute lack of published observational evidence of the specific fracturing mechanisms at play, and particularly their involvement in the hydrocarbon-bearing fracture porosity of igneous reservoirs.\nVolcanological outcrop studies on cooling joints in intrusions propose a characteristic joint size depending on cooling rate, magma chemistry and intrusion geometry (Goehring and Morris, 2008; Het\u00e9nyi et al., 2012). Others suggest power-law (i.e. scale-independent) behavior for several fracture parameters (length, aperture, orientation) for outcrop analogues of oil-bearing sills and assume laterally consistent fracture network properties (Witte et al., 2012). Connectivity is often believed to be high in cooling-joint networks, but this statement is frequently provided without quantitative evidence, particularly in the context of igneous reservoirs (Delpino and Berm\u00fadez, 2009; Gudmundsson and L\u00f8tveit, 2014; Witte et al., 2012). Significantly, the existing models fail to address the strongly varying effect of igneous intrusions on fluid flow and storage. This has been reported both on the global scale (barrier vs. pathway, Senger et al., 2017) and locally, e.g. for intrusions acting as hydrocarbon reservoirs in the northern Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina, which exhibit strong lateral variations in their hydraulic properties (Spacapan et al., 2020a, A. Medialdea, pers. comm.). Thus, additional work is required to quantify fracture network properties in igneous intrusions and document lateral variations. Specifically, there is a pressing need to link this quantification to the underlying fracturing processes in order to improve our understanding of the fracture network evolution and potential causes of the observed hydraulic property variations of igneous intrusions.\nHere, we present a comprehensive field study from the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina, using a reservoir-scale outcrop of a sill complex emplaced in organic-rich shale, which constitutes a direct analogue of oil-producing fractured igneous sills. We show explicit field evidence of the wide spectrum of fracture types and mechanisms affecting the fracture network of an igneous intrusion emplaced in organic rich shale, and combine this with high-resolution digital fracture network quantification over more than 200\u00a0m. Our aims are (1) to provide sound evidence for the broad range of fracture types contributing to the accessible fracture network of igneous sills potentially acting as reservoirs, and (2) to quantify local variability in the fracture network parameters arising from the presence, or absence, of these fracture mechanisms. Thereby, we aim at providing new insight into fracture network evolution within igneous intrusions, with a specific focus on settings where the host rock is organic-rich shale.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe study area is located in the Sierra Azul range in the northern Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina, around 70\u00a0km south of the town Malarg\u00fce (Fig. 1\na). The Neuqu\u00e9n Basin represents one of the Andean foreland basins and comprises a prolific hydrocarbon province with various proven hydrocarbon plays, including commercial oil production from fractured andesitic sills emplaced in organic-rich shales (Howell et al., 2005; Spacapan et al., 2020a).\nThe geodynamic evolution of the basin comprises three main phases (Fig. 1b). Initiation of the basin started in the Triassic-Jurassic as a series of elongated rifts forming isolated depocentres (Howell et al., 2005; Yagupsky et al., 2008). During the early Jurassic period, it subsequently transformed into a back-arc basin dominated by regional thermal subsidence following the onset of the Andean subduction. This phase lead to formation of the marine sediments of the Mendoza group, which include organic-rich shales of the Vaca Muerta and Agrio formations (Bettini and Vasquez, 1979; Manceda and Figueroa, 1995) that constitute two of the main source rocks of the basin. In the late Cretaceous, the tectonic regime changed to compressive, initiating the foreland basin phase. This stage created a series of fold- and thrust belts including the Malarg\u00fce fold-thrust belt through reactivation and inversion of the Rift-related normal faults as well as older basement faults (Manceda and Figueroa, 1995). The outcropping El Manzano sill complex described on this study was brought to surface during this phase and is located adjacent to one of these inverted halfgrabens, the El Manzano-Liu Cull\u00edn lineament (Yagupsky et al., 2008).\nDuring the foreland basin stage, particularly the northern part of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin experienced two main pulses (late Oligocene to Miocene; late Miocene to Pliocene) of extensive volcanism and magmatic intrusion of the sedimentary succession (Combina and Nullo, 2011; Kay et al., 2006). This magmatism profoundly affected the petroleum systems in several ways. First, it provided the necessary heat to generate hydrocarbons from the Vaca Muerta and Agrio formations, which are mainly immature in the study area as shown by thermal modeling and geochemical analysis (Spacapan et al., 2018). Secondly, it generated intrusions that themselves act as naturally fractured reservoirs, constituting atypical petroleum systems such as the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) oil fields (Witte et al., 2012; Spacapan et al., 2020a). The El Manzano sill complex presented in this study represents a direct outcrop analogue of the RGV petroleum system, as it is located just 10\u00a0km west of the oil fields, separated by a major thrust fault (Fig. 1a). The El Manzano outcrop features an exposed seismic-scale sill complex emplaced within the Agrio and Vaca Muerta formations, with interconnected andesitic intrusions of 1\u201320\u00a0m thickness (Fig. 2\n). Ar\u2013Ar dating yields an age of 14\u00a0Ma for one of the sills at El Manzano (see supplementary data). This outcrop is spectacular not only due to its function as a direct analogue outcrop, but because it's continuous high-quality exposure for several kilometers allows studies ranging from the scale of seismic surveys (e.g., Rabbel et al., 2018) to detailed outcrop investigations.\nSome 5\u00a0km from the El Manzano sill complex, Borello (1944) first described outcrops of solid bitumen. Dykes and sills of bitumen (also termed \u201casphaltene\u201d) are common in the northern Neuqu\u00e9n Basin and have been mined extensively (e.g., Cobbold et al., 1999). Their formation is linked to fracturing and short-distance migration in response to fluid overpressure (Parnell and Carey 1995). The causes of overpressure formation have been debated for decades and are still uncertain, but strong heating pulses during phases of volcanism have repeatedly been proposed, because bitumen occurrence clusters around volcanic centers and the heat may trigger fast maturation and overpressure build-up (Rassmuss, 1923; Cobbolt et al., 2014; Zanella et al., 2015).\n\n\n3\nData and methods\n\n3.1\nField documentation, samples and geochemical analyses\nThe observations and data presented in this study where obtained during two campaigns totaling six weeks of fieldwork at the El Manzano outcrop, including exploration as well as detailed sampling (Fig. 2). In addition to the overall architecture of the sill complex, we focused on documenting the wide range of fracture types observed throughout the locality. This included drone surveys (DJI Phantom 3), field photographs, manual structural measurements of fault, fracture and bedding planes. We also collected 27 samples of different types of veins for hand sample and thin section descriptions, as well as Raman spectroscopy and qualitative conductivity measurements using a handheld multimeter setup to constrain the thermal alteration of organic matter in terms of potential graphitization (sample locations indicated in Fig. 2). Since solid, low-maturity bitumen is an insulator but graphite is an excellent conductor, any measurable conductivity in dry samples should indicate significant graphitization. Raman spectroscopy includes analysis of the positions and intensities of the spectral peaks at 1345\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1585\u00a0cm\u22121, termed D (\u201cdisorder\u201d) and G (\u201cgraphite\u201d) peaks, respectively (Potgieter-Vermaak et al., 2011). For samples undergoing initial thermal alteration (prior to long-term thermal metamorphism), the G peak narrows and shifts towards 1615\u00a0cm\u22121 with increasing alteration but shifts back to ca. 1598\u00a0cm\u22121 if graphite is formed (Muirhead et al., 2012). Experimental investigations of short, intense heating of meteorite and immature bitumen samples indicate a rise in the peak intensity ratio ID\/IG from around 0.6 to around 1, which may be used to investigate settings involving local heating due to igneous intrusions (Muirhead et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014).\nAlong a sub-vertical section through the main outcrop cliff (white lines in Fig. 2), we analyzed 16 shale samples using Rock-Eval pyrolysis. This is a standard tool to evaluate the realized and overall hydrocarbon generation potential of source rocks, and thus routinely used in the petroleum industry (e.g., Lafargue et al., 1998). RockEval serves as an indicator of thermal maturity and type of organic matter and is commonly used to quantify the maturation effect of igneous intrusions on organic-rich shale (Aarnes et al., 2011; Einsele et al., 1980; Spacapan et al., 2018). During pyrolysis, samples are heated to several hundred degrees in a step-wise process to identify the amount of free hydrocarbons (S1 peak), the remaining hydrocarbon potential (S2 peak), oxygen index (OI), total organic carbon (TOC) and hydrocarbon index (HI) (Espitali\u00e9 et al., 1985). HI is calculated as S2\/TOC x 100, yielding milligrams of hydrocarbons per gram of organic matter. Assuming initial HI from immature samples or literature values, this is used to calculate the transformation ratio (TR) of organic matter into hydrocarbons.\n\n\n3.2\nFracture network quantification\nThis study aims to quantify potential lateral changes in fracture network parameters in response to the evidence of different fracture processes observed in the field. In addition to manual 1D scanlines for ground-truthing (Guerriero et al., 2010), we collected drone-based and handheld imagery to obtain high-resolution 3D digital outcrop models and orthophotographs from a selected outcrop location (Fig. 2) using structure-from-motion (e.g., Westoby et al., 2012). Augmenting the previously created large-scale, decimeter-resolution 3D model to interpret large-scale sill geometries (presented in Rabbel et al., 2018), the new 3D model allows mapping of fractures down to the sub-cm scale over a 230\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0m outcrop section. The model was georeferenced relative to the existing differential GPS-referenced large-scale model, leading to an integrated digital outcrop dataset across the scales.\nIn addition to collecting manual data, we extracted 3D plane orientation data of fracture planes along digital scanlines using the Lime software package (Buckley et al., 2019). Scanlines run both parallel and orthogonal to the intrusion boundary in order to minimize scanline orientation bias. This also exemplifies the benefit of digital outcrops in fracture mapping, as manual collection of fracture plane data from the inaccessible cliff in the intrusion center was not feasible. Note that for digital plane measurements, we used models with significantly higher mesh resolution compared to standard visualization purposes to avoid erroneous measurements resulting from smoothing of the digital outcrop surface. All fracture plane orientations were corrected for local dip of the surrounding sedimentary layers.\nAs a key element of the fracture network characterization, we generated an ultra-high resolution (down to 3 mm\/pixel) orthorectified photograph of a 230\u00a0m outcrop section with exceptional outcrop quality and with many observations evidencing the presence of different fracturing processes (Fig. 2). We used the orthophotograph to manually pick 2D fracture trace maps, which subsequently served as input for automated fracture network analysis using the FracPaQ Matlab toolbox (Healy et al., 2017). This software provides comprehensive measurements and estimates of fracture network properties, including fracture density and intensity, connectivity, trace and segment length distributions, as well as 2D orientation distribution of the fracture network. 2D fracture density and intensity, commonly termed P20 and P21 (e.g., Zeeb et al., 2013), represent number of fractures and length of fractures per unit area, respectively, and are measured here using the circular estimator method (Healy et al., 2017). Similar to the P10 value for 1D fracture intensity, commonly obtained from scanlines, P21, in particular, serves as an estimate for the fracture area per unit volume (P32), which is a critical input in fracture network modeling controlling the number of fractures in a model.\nConnectivity of fracture networks is quantified using the network topology in terms of relative abundance of node types, i.e. crossing (X-node), abutting (Y-node) and isolated termination (I-node). Note that any 2D mapping of fractures aimed at quantifying connectivity therefore needs to take care to correctly map fracture connections corresponding to the observed node types. For a given number N of X-,Y- and I-nodes, we get the average number of connections per line as \n\n\nC\nL\n\n=\n\n\n4\n*\n\n(\n\n\nN\nX\n\n+\n\nN\nY\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nN\nI\n\n+\n\nN\nY\n\n\n\n\n (Sanderson and Nixon, 2018). We calculated CL along a moving window of 35\u00a0m width that was shifted by 15\u00a0m, yielding a continuous curve of 15 connectivity values along the outcrop, each allocated to the position of the center of the window.\nFinally, the FracPaQ provides a Maximum-Likelihood-Estimator (MLE) test to assess the likelihood of observed trace lengths being drawn from a (i) power-law, (ii) log-normal or (iii) exponential distribution (Rizzo et al., 2017). Thereby we aim to (1) avoid misleading results for length distribution characteristics from a wrong initial assumption, and (2) gain insight into how different fracture processes may alter the fracture length distribution. We performed this analysis in three manually selected subsets of the fracture network, according to outcrop-based observations of distinct processes, i.e., we separated the central area affected by a fault and bitumen dykes from the outer areas dominated by cooling joints. In order to account for potential truncation bias when fitting a power-law, we applied a lower cutoff according to the recommendations of Bonnet et al. (2001), while we did not apply an upper cutoff, because the intrusion gives a natural upper length limit through its size.\nAs a trade-off between data size and quality, we integrated two different drone surveys conducted from slightly varying distance to outcrop, resulting in different resolutions of 3 and 12 mm\/pixel, respectively. This can be problematic, as the recorded number of fractures is often subject to resolution bias (Zeeb et al., 2013). However, we justify our approach by comparing digital results to manual scanlines (ground-truthing) and considering on-site outcrop observations (cf. supplement S1). Comparison of manual fracture density measurements with values from digital data in areas of lower resolution found the values to be identical, i.e. we do not expect significant resolution bias at the lower end of the scale. These areas show no signs of tectonic deformation or natural hydraulic fracturing, with small-scale fracturing absent upon inspection in the field. Where these processes are in fact present, we have high-resolution data available and are thus able to map smaller fractures, but without compromising comparability of the overall fracture data.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nFracture types\n\n4.1.1\nCooling joints\nAs can be expected for thin sheet intrusions within a fold-thrust belt, we observe that the intrusions display strong, though not homogenous, jointing. Note that without additional observations (e.g., polygonal arrangement or orientation relative to intrusion-host contact), it is inherently difficult to distinguish cooling joints from tectonic joints. Therefore, some of the observed jointing may be of tectonic nature or at least may have formed in a stage of active compressive tectonics. However, since some additional observations are available and cooling joints represent a ubiquitous feature of igneous sheet intrusions, we refer to the observed joints as cooling joints.\n\nFig. 3\n shows examples of cooling joints with bitumen filling or impregnation of their fracture surfaces. This is frequently found within intrusions at El Manzano. We occasionally observe polygonal joint arrangement typical of cooling joints, especially in places where the roof of an intrusion is exposed (Fig. 3a). In addition, the polygonal fracture planes are filled with a mixture of black and white material, identified as solid organic matter and calcite, respectively (Fig. 3a, close-up). In some cases, the joints exhibit plumose structures (Fig. 3b). The solid bitumen filling shows no evidence of leftover volatiles and instead appears as either a shiny black powder or bitumen (Fig. 3b and c).\n\n\n4.1.2\nBituminous injection structures\nThroughout the El Manzano sill complex, we observe large structures of injected bitumen or bituminous material within and around intrusions (Figs. 4 and 5\n\n; see Fig. 2 for sampled localities). Note that throughout this work, we use the term \u201cbitumen\u201d if veins or joints are filled or impregnated with pure bitumen, while \u201cbituminous\u201d describes observations where such fillings are impure (e.g. mixed with shale) or we are unsure of the exact nature of the organic matter. These injection structures occur in the form (1) arrays of pure bitumen dykes with observed individual sizes of up to ca 20\u00a0m height and 50\u00a0cm width (Fig. 4a and b), or (2) areas of intense and chaotic fracturing, where fractures are filled with a mixture of bitumen, shaly material and\/or calcite (Fig. 5). These spectacular features are localized around the sills and originate in the aureoles from where they may extend far into the igneous bodies (Fig. 4a). We do not observe such dykes outside of the direct vicinity of an intrusion or its aureole, i.e. they do not seem to cut the stratigraphy over more than 10\u201320\u00a0m. On closer inspection, the dykes consist not of a single mass, but several branches, which may also cut across each other (Fig. 4b and c). In other cases, the dykes can mingle with thick calcite veins (see section 4.2.3), typically without a clear crosscutting relationship (Fig. 4d and e). While we did not find an exposed root of a pure bitumen dyke, the shale-bitumen filled fractures displayed in Fig. 5 appear to originate directly from the contact zone, where we observe meter-scale cavities due to missing host rock (Fig. 5a and b).\nThe zones around such injection structures are intensely fractured and host large amounts of mobilized organic matter. While the fractured intrusive rock around the injection structure hosting bitumen-shale mixture disintegrates so readily that sampling is impossible (Fig. 5c), we were able to collect several samples of the more solid bitumen dykes (e.g. Fig. 4d, f, g). The hand sample shown in Fig. 4d displays mingling of cm-scale calcite and bitumen veins within intrusion. In addition, we observe that the bituminous material in many of the dykes has a shiny, fibrous, crystalline-looking appearance (Fig. 4f). In some of the samples, we found shale fragments and calcite crystals of millimeter to centimeter size in the bituminous matrix of such dykes (Fig. 4g). Note that due to the crosscutting of different types of veins, it is not always possible to keep the description of these features fully separated.\n\nFig. 6\n depicts Raman spectra of three bitumen samples collected from intermingling bitumen and calcite veins in the southern part of El Manzano. All spectra show clear disorder and graphite peaks, of which the graphite peaks at around 1585\u00a0cm\u22121 are particularly well developed. Peak intensity ratios ID\/IG lie between 0.85 and 0.93. In addition, qualitative conductivity measurements indicate that dry bitumen samples with fibrous and shiny appearance conduct electrical currents.\nRockEval pyrolysis provides results for thermal maturity of the Agrio formation at the El Manzano outcrop (Fig. 7\n). Assuming initial HI of 538\u00a0mg\/g corresponding to the observed maximum value, our analysis indicates 0\u201320% transformation of organic matter in the parts of the section that are least affected igneous sills, while the aureole of the sills clearly shows increased transformation of up to 99% close to the sills, where injection structures are found. Note that other authors report lower initial HI in the area (e.g., Spacapan et al., 2018), which would lead to even smaller TR, especially in the less affected regions.\n\n\n4.1.3\nHydrothermal calcite veins\nThroughout the outcrop, we find many large carbonate veins cutting through both aureole and sills, that are distinctly different from calcite-filled cooling joints, and also show no signs of shear displacement (Fig. 8\n). The veins occur both at sill tips, and along the more central part of sills and may crosscut, or be crosscut by, bitumen dykes (Fig. 8a and b, also Fig. 5e). Commonly, these features are several centimeters to a meter wide, tens to hundreds of meters long, and include arrays of branching veins (Fig. 8a, c), and carry fragments of host rock (Fig. 8d). Millimeter-to centimeter-scale macropores like the one displayed in Fig. 8e are very common and often filled with bitumen, and release a strong hydrocarbon smell when broken up. Fluid inclusions with CO2 were identified using Raman spectroscopy (supplement S2). Occasionally, we find stains of highly viscous oil within the veins (Fig. 8f).\n\n\n4.1.4\nFaults and associated damage zones\nAlthough the El Manzano outcrop is located in the hanging wall of the major thrust front of Sierra Azul range, faulting within the outcropping sill complex is limited to small-scale strike-slip and thrust faults cross-cutting the sills, as summarized in Fig. 9\n. Displacement along these faults typically is on the centimeter to meter range and locally causes enhanced fracturing in the form of damage zones. These damage zones commonly feature fractures filled with solid bitumen and low-viscosity, strongly degraded oil as well as calcite veins (Fig. 9b\u2013d). Fig. 9c shows an example of a bitumen-filled fracture cross-cutting an amygdale partly filling primary vesicular porosity. Fig. 9e presents an example of a small-scale thrust fault cutting a sill and the surrounding sediments, which also contain bedding-parallel calcite veins. Despite the small extent of this fault, its core hosts a damage-zone filled with massive calcite veins that (1) show striations indicating shear movement and (2) release strong hydrocarbon odor when broken up.\n\n\n\n4.2\nLateral variability of the fracture network\n\n4.2.1\nOrientation patterns of fracture types\nAs the first step of a quantitative description of the variability of fracture types and their distribution, we provide dip-corrected plane orientations of different fracture types collected throughout the El Manzano sill complex (Fig. 10\n). Cooling joint data show predominantly vertical to subvertical planes. Despite a generally large spread in azimuths, there exists some agreement with the orientation of the main tectonic structures of the Sierra Azul range in the form of one E-W striking set and two conjugate NE-SW\/NW-SE striking sets. Fault plane orientations show a NNE-SSW striking reverse fault and two ESE-WNW striking strike-slip faults, of which one is slightly oblique and has a reverse-fault component (cf. Fig. 9a). Bitumen dykes are characterized by vertical to subvertical dip and a pronounced preferred orientation in N\u2013S and E\u2013W direction, and thus with the large-scale tectonic structures. Orientations of the predominantly vertical hydrothermal calcite veins comprise one strong E\u2013W striking set, but the remaining plane measurements spread over a wide range of orientations.\n\n\n4.2.2\nInfluence of sill architecture\nOverall, we observe that fracture patterns change notably with sill architecture and geometry. Although a full documentation of the sill complex architecture and geometries found at El Manzano and their influence on the fracture network is beyond the scope of this work, the example in Fig. 11\n qualitatively illustrates some key effects. The digital outcrop model illustrated in Fig. 11 is located in the northern part of the outcrop and comprises amalgamated and stacked sills of varying thickness. The massive sill in the lower left of Fig. 11 is approximately 11\u00a0m thick and terminates in this location, where the sill tip is visible. It comprises few, long subvertical joints as well as radial joints, which are characteristic for sill tips (see e.g., Galland et al., 2019). On the other hand, the even thicker sill on the right side consists of four stacked intrusions, which are distinguished through different weathering colour, clear horizontal contacts, and occasionally even thin lenses of host rock between them. Here, we find more, but shorter fractures mostly confined to one of the thin intrusion layers.\nThe P21 fracture intensity distribution (Fig. 12\nd) varies considerably along the outcrop. The outer domains (0\u201390\u00a0m and 160\u2013230\u00a0m, respectively) comprise P21 values of 0\u20132.5\u00a0m-1, averaging 1.2\u00a0m-1. We find higher values in the central domain between 90 and 160\u00a0m, which includes the fault as well as the bitumen dyke, injection structure and intrusion step. Here, average P21 is 2.0\u00a0m-1, with minimum values of around 1\u00a0m\u22121 and local maximum values of up to 3 and 6\u00a0m\u22121 around the fault and injection structures, respectively.\nFinally, Fig. 12e illustrates the connectivity variations along the outcrop section in terms of average connections per line (CL). We include theoretical thresholds for onset of initial fracture connectivity (CL\u00a0=\u00a02, red line) as well as percolation (CL\u00a0=\u00a03.57, green dashed line) for reference. Again, we identify that connectivity in the two outer domains differs markedly from the central domain. In the outer domains, we obtain connectivity values of 1.47\u20132.47 and 2.12\u20132.44, respectively, i.e. partly below the threshold for a connected network. In the central domain, values vary between 3.25 and 4.02 average connections per line, i.e. the network is well connected and partly percolating.\n\n\n4.2.3\nTrace length statistics and MLE results\nStatistical analysis results of the fracture trace length are presented in Fig. 13\n. For a qualitative overview, we display the fracture trace map color-coded by length Fig. 13a. It is already possible to see that the left and right domains (0\u201390\u00a0m, 160\u2013230\u00a0m) are dominated by fewer, longer fractures compared to the central domain comprising fault and injection structures in addition to cooling joints (90\u2013160\u00a0m). Also, we generally observe more and shorter fractures close to the contacts compared to the center. The overall trace length histogram indicates that small fractures dominate the mapped population with a peak at approximately at 0.4\u00a0m, and more than 80% smaller than 3\u00a0m. Interestingly, there is a small second peak at around 17\u00a0m, leading to a strongly asymmetric bimodal distribution.\nWe aim to quantify the lateral variability of the length distribution and assess the best mathematical description. Therefore, we present results of MLE fitting for power-law (Fig. 13c\u2013e) and log-normal distributions (Fig. 13f\u2013h) organized in three columns corresponding to the left, center and right parts of the outcrop, respectively, with a lower cutoff applied to account for truncation effects (red dotted line, supplement S3 for details). Table 1\n summarizes the estimated likelihood for both distributions as well as exponential distribution, both with and without a cutoff. As a reminder, the MLE method estimates the likelihood that a population of values is drawn from a specific distribution.\nFor a power-law as well as exponential distribution, irrespective of an applied correction for truncation effects, the result is zero or near-zero percent likelihood (Table 1). For the power-law analysis shown in Fig. 13c\u2013e, this is reflected in a visibly poor fit in all three domains of the outcrop. We also observe a clear \u201ckink\u201d resulting from a change in slope for fractures large than around 15\u00a0m, especially in the outer domains where cooling joints dominate (Fig. 13 c, e). Note in general that only the central domain data still stretch significantly more than one magnitude if a possible truncation bias is accounted for.\nThe MLE results for log-normal distributions yield \u226599 percent likelihood for the left, central and right domains of the outcrop, respectively, if no cut-off is applied to the observations (Table 1). Although generally applying a cutoff decreases the MLE likelihood, the domains are affected differently. While outer domains still reach values of 75 and 95 percent, respectively, the central domain drops to less than 5 percent likelihood, essentially ruling out a log-normal distribution. The generally better fit of log-normal distributions to our trace length data is visible in Fig. 13 f-h. Note again that in the left and right outcrop domains, the largest fractures (ca. 15\u201320) m produce a local deviation from the trend, leading to underestimation by log-normal distributions (Fig. 13f, h). Exponential distributions score near-zero percentages in all MLE analysis.\n\n\n\n\n5\nInterpretation\n\n5.1\nFracture network evolution\nOur field observations show that, in the same geological setting, a wide range of fracture types can occur in the fracture network of igneous intrusions. We find bitumen and\/or dead oil in all four identified fracture types within the sills at El Manzano (Fig. 3a and b; Fig. 4; Fig. 5b and c; Fig. 8e and f; Fig. 9b\u2013d), demonstrating that all fracture types may be accessible as pathways or even storage for hydrocarbons, but also fluids in general. Although most fracture types are directly related to the intrusion event, the underlying physical mechanisms of their formation are fundamentally different, resulting in a complex evolution of a laterally heterogenous fracture network.\nExcept for tectonic fractures, the fracture system in the sills is established within the period of cooling of the intrusion. While cooling joints form due to thermal stresses as the intrusion solidifies and contracts, the case of injection structures and large calcite veins are less obvious. However, the generally high thermal grade of the bitumen dykes in a geological setting with low burial-related temperatures and nearly no maturation (Fig. 7), as well as entrainment of host rock pieces in intermingling bitumen and calcite veins (Figs. 4e and 8d) strongly suggests that these features formed in the high-temperature environment with substantial fluid-overpressure surrounding the intrusions.\nThe driving processes for early fracture formation in the intrusions are thus not tectonic but related to thermally controlled processes around and within the intrusion, such as cooling-related contraction, hydrothermalism and metamorphic reactions including organic matter maturation in the surrounding host rock. However, these processes occur within tectonic far-field stresses, which is reflected in the alignment with the tectonic structures and inferred E-W maximum compressive stress for all fracture types (Fig. 10). We will provide a more detailed interpretation of the individual fracture types in separate paragraphs.\nTectonically driven fracturing represents the only fracture mechanisms independent of the intrusion-related thermally controlled processes. Although overprinting due to faults is limited in the case of El Manzano, both qualitative and quantitative results show that faults may locally alter the initial fracture network and affect multiple intrusions (Figs. 9 and 12). The exact timing of faulting after emplacement remains unclear in this case. It is only constrained by the time of sill solidification and the end of tectonic activity in the Sierra Azul range, which are both Miocene. However, due to the short time required for the relative thin intrusions to cool (tens to hundreds of years), we generally regard faulting as a post-emplacement process.\n\n\n5.2\nControlling factors of thermally driven fracture types\n\n5.2.1\nCooling joints\nCooling joints are ubiquitous features throughout the field area and comprise bitumen filling in many locations (Fig. 3). Their distribution and characteristics within the intrusions of the sill complex are quite variable and depend on several factors, including intrusion thickness, architecture and geometry. Fig. 11 illustrates the relationship between these factors and the cooling joint distribution. Thick, massive intrusions emplaced as a single body tend to develop fewer, but longer cooling joints compared to the many small fractures seen intrusions that may be of similar overall thickness, but consist of multiple, partly disconnected branches. This is most likely the result of different cooling rates in the two scenarios, since higher cooling rates produce smaller joints (Het\u00e9nyi et al., 2012). Even within intrusions the spatial distribution may vary, as we often observe more small cooling joints along the intrusion contact compared to the interior (Fig. 12b). This could be related to a similar effect of faster cooling of the intrusion boundary in the initial phase after emplacement, when temperature gradients are still large. Since cooling joints propagate perpendicular to the intrusion surface, any curvature induces a change in local orientation distribution, e.g. at sill terminations or steps (Figs. 11 and 12). All of the above leads us to the interpretation that the emplacement mechanism and its controlling factors play a major role in the final cooling joint distribution, as it controls the shape and architecture of intrusions and thus defines the boundary conditions for joint formation. In addition, far-field stresses may lead to preferential alignment of the cooling joints with the prevailing stress field (e.g., Maher 2020), as the confining stresses are likely anisotropic (Fig. 10).\nDue to the impregnation of joint surfaces with organic matter interpreted as high-grade bitumen (Fig. 3a and b), we suggest that cooling joints may act as fluid pathways for hydrocarbons when the intrusion is still in the cooling phase. Any fluids flowing through newly formed cooling joints would be heated to temperatures of several hundred degrees, likely leading to combustion of all volatile hydrocarbons, leaving solid leftovers in the form of bitumen.\n\n\n5.2.2\nBituminous injection structures\nThe bitumen dykes and injection structures (Figs. 4 and 5) are perhaps the most spectacular fracture type observed in this study. We interpret them to result from strong heating and subsequent fast hydrocarbon generation in the metamorphic aureole of the sill intrusions, causing hydrofracturing within the shale due to fluid overpressure, sometimes up to the point of disintegration of the sediments. We base this interpretation on a combination of several observations. The very low background maturity level (TR\u00a0=\u00a00\u201320%) of the Agrio formation shale only increases to high values towards the intrusion contacts, where essentially all organic matter has been transformed to hydrocarbons (Fig. 7). Consequently, mobilization of hydrocarbons in the amounts necessary to form up to meter-thick bitumen dykes (Fig. 3) requires the heat input provided by the intruding magma. In the high-temperature environment of thermal aureoles, maturation takes place over very short periods (hours to years, e. g. Iyer et al., 2017; Panahi et al., 2019), which can be regarded as geologically instantaneous. This would not allow for flow-driven overpressure relaxation within the practically impermeable shale formations, leading to propagation of fractures.\nStrong additional fracturing of the intrusions, thinning and branching fractures, as well as partially missing host rock next to injection structures near the contact evidence propagation of the hydrofractures from the aureole into the intrusions (Figs. 4, 5, and 12a, b). Mutual cross-cutting of bitumen dykes or calcite veins shows that new fractures were repeatedly generated with enough pressure to propagate through the previous generation in a \u201ccrack-seal\u201d fashion (Fig. 4c, e). Although previously formed cooling joints may have been exploited in some places, the propagation of bitumen dykes through the host rock and into the sill (Fig. 4a and b and 5) must be related to hydraulic fracturing.\nBoth Raman spectrograms (Fig. 6) and electrical conductivity of the bituminous material in the injection structures evidence strong thermal alteration and graphitization. This indicates formation of the injection structures shortly after solidification of the sill intrusions because this was the only period when temperatures required to form graphite were present at El Manzano (potentially >400\u00a0\u00b0C for hydrothermal graphite, cf. Buseck and Beyssac, 2014).\nSince the bitumen dykes commonly consist of several branches that may also crosscut each other, we suggest that the dykes formed in a series of pulses (Fig. 4a\u2013e). In addition, mutual cross-cutting of calcite veins and bitumen as well as calcite crystals entrained in bitumen dykes (Fig. 4d\u2013g, Fig. 8a) point to (1) a repeated, violent fracturing process in accordance with the hydrofracturing model and (2) involvement of both hydrocarbon and other hydrothermal fluids. We interpret the calcite crystals in Fig. 4g as entrained rather than grown in-situ because of their random orientations within the bitumen dyke (as opposed to e.g. fibrous growth) and the pieces of shale visible in the same dykes, which are clearly not in-situ. The two sets of orientations of bitumen dykes (N\u2013S and E-W, see Fig. 10) may indicate that the hydrofracturing occurred within the far-field stresses related to E-W Andean compression that created the Sierra Azul range. The relatively wide spread of orientations within the sets could be due to exploitation of, or interaction with, existing cooling joints, which show a wide scatter of orientations (Fig. 10).\n\n\n5.2.3\nHydrothermal calcite veins\nDue to their frequent occurrence and size, the large calcite veins observed throughout the El Manzano outcrop represent another important type of fractures present in the igneous intrusions (Fig. 8). The calcite veins observed within and at the tip of intrusions show (1) no indication of shearing and (2) mutual cross-cutting with the graphitic bitumen dykes (Fig. 4d and e and 8a). They are therefore not fault-related, and likely formed contemporaneously with the bitumen dykes in a hydrothermal environment. Samples from calcite veins show inclusions of CO2 within the calcite crystals, which could have been provided either by the intrusion itself, or by degradation of hydrocarbons (supplement S2). Overpressure-driven hydrofracturing during intrusion-related hydrothermalism may be a potential cause of vein formation, since pieces of host rock are commonly entrained in the calcite veins, pointing to a process violent enough to break up the host rock and transport the pieces over some distance (Fig. 8d). Additionally, the observation of bedding-parallel fibrous calcite veins may indicate overpressure in the metamorphic aureole (Fig. 9e). Since the calcite veins often crosscut intrusions (with single veins occasionally crosscutting several intrusions) and can reach many decimeters in thickness, we infer that they are the result of vertical movement of hydrothermal fluids at the scale of tens or even hundreds of meters.\n\n\n\n5.3\nFracture types vs. fracture network properties\nQuantitative fracture network characterization along a 230\u00a0m long outcrop section reveals strong parameter variations caused by local interaction of several fracture types and mechanisms (Figs. 12 and 13). The mapped outcrop shown in Fig. 12 has three domains which comprise different fracture types and features. While the outer domains (0\u201390\u00a0m, 160\u2013230\u00a0m, Fig. 12a) are dominated by cooling joints, the central domain (90\u2013160\u00a0m) includes a fault and two injection structures, as well as a primary step in the intrusion geometry. The step is identified by offset in the sill, but an absence of offset in the sedimentary layer above. While the properties are similar in the outer domains with cooling joints only, the addition of other fracture types in the central domain leads to an increase in density, a wider spread in orientations, and much higher connectivity (Fig. 12b\u2013e). We suggest that the interaction of fracture types other than cooling joints does not only simply add more fractures, but leads to a wider orientation distribution, since faults and injection structures do not necessarily follow paths perpendicular to the intrusion contact like cooling joints. As increasing connectivity requires not just more fractures, but also fracture intersections, the addition of oblique fractures by injection structures and faults is vital for an actual connectivity increase. Importantly, the step in the intrusion geometry introduces inclined cooling joints, which further diversifies the fracture orientations.\nAdditionally, the lateral variability in the presence of different fracture types also manifests itself in the fracture length statistics (Fig. 13). The qualitative impression from the colored fracture map is that smaller fractures are concentrated in the central domain (Fig. 13a). Thus, instead of focusing on the overall length distribution for the entire outcrop (displayed as a histogram in Fig. 13b), we analyze the length distribution per domain. Here, it becomes clear that the outer domains with mainly cooling joints show very similar characteristics. The distributions comprise fractures between ca. 0.2 and 20\u00a0m, with few small and large joints, that fit well with log-normal distributions according to MLE analysis (Fig. 13c, e, Table 1), but not power laws or exponential distributions (Fig. 13f, h, Table 1). We interpret this result in the light of the existence of a characteristic length scale for cooling joints that depends on cooling rates and the size of the intrusion, especially since other fracture types that may alter the distribution are absent. From this perspective the poor fit with a power law is unsurprising since power-laws imply scale-independent distributions. It is noteworthy that the largest joints spanning the entire intrusion thickness (15\u201320\u00a0m) create a \u201ckink\u201d in the distributions that leads to underrepresentation in the log-normal distribution. This indicates that a log-normal distribution also does not fully capture the geological process.\nOn the other hand, the results from the central domain are more difficult to capture in terms of mathematical descriptions. Despite a striking increase in smaller fractures due to faulting and injection structures, MLE analysis yields a poor fit with a power-law even for bias-corrected data, which is also obvious from a qualitative comparison of the best fit and the data (Fig. 13g, Table 1). However, MLE only favors a log-normal distribution if no lower cutoff is applied, and in fact discards a log-normal distribution otherwise (Fig. 13d, Table 1). Based on outcrop observations, we believe that truncation bias of some extent exists in this area, suggesting that not all fractures are represented even in the high-resolution models and a correction should be applied. Consequently, we interpret the lack of any reasonable fit with standard mathematical models common in fracture length description to be a result of interacting fracture processes with very different underlying physics. The blend of cooling joints, a fault-related damage zone and two injection structures creates a highly heterogenous local fracture population which markedly increases fracture density and connectivity but does not seem to follow any unified fracture length distribution.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nFracture network evolution\nEstablishing the fracture evolution within the igneous intrusions at El Manzano is an important step towards understanding fracturing of igneous intrusions in organic-rich shales in general. In addition, it provides further insight into the igneous petroleum system evolution of producing igneous sill reservoirs, such as those in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. Our multi-disciplinary methodology allows us to constrain timing and temperature conditions during fracture formation, and demonstrate the quantitative manifestation of the wide spectrum of fracture processes in the form of laterally varying fracture parameters over hundreds of meters. In the following paragraphs, we will utilize our results to critically evaluate the existing conceptual model of thermal impact and fracture evolution in the igneous petroleum systems in the Rio Grande Valley (Spacapan et al., 2020a; Witte et al., 2012). Based on this evaluation, we present a more process-oriented model focused on fracturing mechanisms that honors both previous knowledge and the plentiful field evidence provided in this article (Fig. 14\n).\n\n6.1.1\nThermal phase: hydro-thermo-mechanical interaction\nThe existing models emphasize the importance of intrusion-related processes. Spacapan et al. (2020a) distinguish two phases: The initial \u201cthermal stage\u201d is dominated by temperature-driven metamorphic reactions in the aureole and fluid migration away from the intrusion due to local pressure gradients. During the subsequent \u201ccooling stage\u201d, a cooling joint network is established and hydrothermally driven hydraulic fracturing occurs in the host rock, leading to a first pulse of fluid and hydrocarbon migration into the intrusions due to a reversed fluid pressure gradient (Witte et al., 2012). This model implies a clear temporal sequence of fluid generation in high temperature environment, followed by fracturing and migration in a cooler environment.\nHowever, from our observations, a key characteristic of the early phase after magma emplacement is that processes appear to take place simultaneously, and chemical reactions, fracturing and migration have an immediate causal relationship. The occurrence of injection structures showing strong thermal alteration (graphitization) and evidence of forceful injection (Figs. 4\u20137), as well as bitumen impregnating cooling joints (Fig. 3) and hydrothermal veins carrying host rock pieces and intermingling with bitumen dykes (Fig. 8) demonstrate that hydrocarbon-bearing fluids entered the intrusion at temperatures of several hundred degrees. The intense modification of the fracture network (Figs. 12 and 13) we observe within intrusions through interaction of bituminous injection structures and cooling joints shortly after emplacement represents a novel result that is not included in previous models.\nOur interpretation of emplacement of injection structures in distinct pulses fits well with results from field studies, laboratory models and numerical studies of maturation-related fracture networks, where repeated pressure build-up and release is observed (Kobchenko et al., 2014; Panahi et al., 2019; Rabbel et al., 2020). Previous field studies reported on extensive bitumen dykes in the northern Neuqu\u00e9n basin and suggested a connection to volcanic activity based on general proximity of the dykes to volcanic bodies and radial bitumen dyke orientations around volcanic centers (Rassmuss, 1923; Cobbold et al., 2014; Zanella et al., 2015). Our study demonstrates this connection and, at least in the study area, clearly establishes that the bitumen dykes formed before the intrusion has fully cooled down. Note, however, that both the thermal maturity and proximity to volcanic structures of bitumen dykes across the basin varies greatly. Different modes of formation have been suggested and their evolutional model requires a case-by-case evaluation (Parnell and Carey 1995).\nOur interpretation agrees with observations from other studies of sediment-intrusion interactions focusing on pressure evolution in these systems. From the moment of emplacement, the intrusion cools down and shrinks, progressively generating primary porosity in the form of cooling joints and vesicles as well as strong fluid underpressure even before complete solidification (Aarnes et al., 2008). At the same time, temperatures in the organic-rich shales rise. The resulting fast hydrocarbon generation, mineral dehydration and thermal fluid expansion causes a drastic rise in pore fluid pressure in the impermeable shale, leading to hydraulic fracturing (Aarnes et al., 2012). The occurrence of bedding-parallel fibrous veins (Fig. 9e) in the contact aureole as well as bitumen dykes at El Manzano (Figs. 4 and 5) matches well with previous work from the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin that related these features to strong heating and hydraulic fracturing in shales, possibly due to volcanic activity (Zanella et al., 2015). Thus, a situation arises in which different fracturing processes within sediments and intrusions are ongoing, and fluid flow of newly created fluids or fluidized sediments into the intrusion (c.f. Fig. 14 a-e) is facilitated by an inward-directed fluid pressure gradient (Svensen et al., 2010). Importantly, the intrusion temperature at this time is still at several hundred degrees, causing thermal alteration of the incoming material.\nOverall, the dynamic period directly after emplacement appears to be defining for the formation of the initial fracture distribution in intrusions emplaced in organic-rich shales. Despite the comfort afforded by a model displaying the clear distinction of phases by timing and processes, we argue that a more accurate description of the \u201cthermal phase\u201d of an evolutionary model should comprise simultaneous, interacting processes leading to an initially heterogeneous fracture network, as depicted in Fig. 14. Tectonic overprinting after the intrusion has cooled down may further alter this fracture network, potentially also establishing connections to previously isolated primary pores (Figs. 9c and 14).\n\n\n\n6.2\nImplications for the petroleum system\n\n6.2.1\nFracture network properties of igneous reservoirs\nOur field observations indicating direct evidence for bitumen and\/or dead oil occurring in each fracture type demonstrate that all types of fractures found in the igneous intrusions can be involved in hosting hydrocarbons (Fig. 14). This complements previous conceptual studies based on well data and modeling, which focus on the contribution of cooling joints to the fracture porosity of igneous reservoirs (e.g., Delpino and Berm\u00fadez, 2009; Gudmundsson and L\u00f8tveit, 2014). We present an easily accessible, world-class locality where geologists can observe the role of different fracture types in the petroleum system firsthand.\nHigh lateral variability of fracture intensity and connectivity (Fig. 12) implies strong changes in fluid storage capacity as well as fracture permeability over short distances. In this context, interaction of multiple fracture types appears to enhance reservoir quality locally. Additionally, our results highlight laterally varying fracture length statistics and render power-law behavior for fracture length in igneous intrusions unlikely (Fig. 13, Table 1). Among the available choices evaluated using the MLE method, a log-normal distribution with laterally varying parameters provides the best results, although in intensely fractured areas affected by multiple fracturing mechanisms this model fails to accurately reflect the entire fracture network. This may be explained by an overprinting of fracture populations associated with the different fracturing processes, some of which (e.g., tectonic fracturing) may create a power law distribution, while others (e.g. cooling joints) have characteristic length scales related to intrusion geometry and boundary conditions of the cooling process (Goehring and Morris, 2008; Het\u00e9nyi et al., 2012). Overall, the striking lateral variability of the fracture network over 10s\u2013100s of meters contrasts with previous findings by Witte et al. (2012), who stated that fracture networks and therefore permeability should be relatively constant over such distances. We therefore advise that any attempt to model the fracture networks of intrusions in a petroleum system should include careful evaluation of evidence for lateral heterogeneity of the fracture network.\nProduction data from oil fields close to El Manzano (Fig. 1) were published by Spacapan et al. (2020a), showing high initial production rates followed by a sharp drop, sometimes only after a couple of months. They related this to initial drainage of the hydrocarbons in the fracture network, followed by a much smaller mixed matrix-fracture production. As the El Manzano sill complex represents a direct outcrop analogue for the adjacent subsurface systems of the Rio Grande Valley comprising comparable extent and intrusion sizes, the outcrops may serve to develop a better understanding of the subsurface fracture systems holding the producible hydrocarbons. Perhaps, the local areas of extreme fracture density seen at El Manzano (Fig. 12) represent the pockets of high fracture density that are drained in the initial phase of production. However, previous research pointed out the existence of so-called cavity zones that may not always be related to fracturing but could also be due to large vesicles form by late-stage volatiles (Berm\u00fadez and Delpino, 2008; Witte et al., 2012). A promising next step would be to utilize the quantitative outcrop observations to conduct fluid flow and production simulations for comparison.\n\n\n6.2.2\nHydrocarbon generation and migration\nThe thermal effect of intrusions in terms of a metamorphic aureole with rapid hydrocarbon maturation is well established through case studies around the world (Aarnes et al., 2010; Muirhead et al., 2017; Rodriguez Monreal et al., 2009; Spacapan et al., 2018). In the case of El Manzano, this effect is an overall positive one, since previously immature source rocks show elevated transformation ratios around the intrusions (Fig. 7). However, the discovery of graphitic bitumen dykes and bitumen within intrusions and their aureoles is an important discovery, because it provides evidence for mobilization and migration of hydrocarbon-bearing fluids into the intrusions while the temperatures are sufficient for substantial thermal alteration. Although our thermal methods are qualitative and cannot assess the exact temperature, the observed graphitization indicates that the hydrocarbon-rich fluids experienced \u201cin-situ combustion\u201d at several hundred degrees. Considering the impressive size of some the observed bitumen dykes, a significant part of the petroleum potential around the intrusions may be lost in the first pulse of local fluid generation and migration, which has previously been proposed as a charge mechanism for oil into the intrusions (Spacapan et al., 2020a; Witte et al., 2012). It is important to note that the bitumen dykes observed in the outcrops are always proximal to intrusions and do not extend far from the contacts, making them very localized migration features. Assuming a penny-shape for the bitumen dyke shown in Fig. 4a as lower boundary, this feature alone comprises around 160\u00a0m3 (ca. 1000 barrels) of solid bitumen. Further investigation should explore this migration pulse in more detail to quantify the hydrocarbon volume that may survive. It seems reasonable to assume that for liquid hydrocarbons to survive and be produced, migration into the fractured intrusions must take place after the intrusion has fully or nearly cooled down to ambient temperatures.\nFurthermore, our observations agree with the suggestion of Spacapan et al. (2020a) that both the faults and hydrothermal calcite veins may connect different levels of sill intrusions and facilitate vertical migration of hydrocarbons from lower stratigraphic levels, in this case the Vaca Muerta Fm (Fig. 14). At El Manzano, both features commonly intersect and thus connect several intrusions, and show evidence of hydrocarbons occupying their porosity (Fig. 8e and f, 9c and d). These features may therefore control local fluid flow patterns and should be included in reservoir-scale flow modeling.\n\n\n6.2.3\nImplications for geophysical properties\nFinally, our results may reveal some of the geological mechanisms responsible for the large variations in geophysical properties observed in well data from the intrusive reservoirs near the study area (Rabbel et al., 2018; Spacapan et al., 2020b; Witte et al., 2012). In addition to mineral composition (both primary and secondary), porosity and fracturing strongly control seismic velocity changes in igneous rocks (e.g., Berge et al., 1992; Mark et al., 2018). Although we do not provide measurements or modeling of potential fracture-related velocity changes in the intrusions investigated in this study, the drastic increase in fracture density as well as the associated alteration should be capable of reducing seismic velocities of intrusions significantly. In fact, the El Manzano field locality previously served as a site for outcrop-based seismic modeling of a sill complex investigating the effects of velocity variations on seismic imaging of intrusions and found marked dimming of reflections if velocities are at the lower end of the spectrum (Rabbel et al., 2018). In addition, increased fracturing due to metamorphic reactions in the aureole as well as the occurrence of graphite may contribute to the low-resistivity zones around sills documented by Spacapan et al. (2020b). Thus, the presented field study may give applied geophysicists a more practical understanding of the geological features they are dealing with and illustrate potential causes of the wide spectrum of seismic responses that are possible in igneous intrusions.\n\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe present an interdisciplinary field study of the fracture network in an igneous sill complex emplaced in organic-rich shale in the northern Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina. Our observations including drone and ground based photogrammetry and geochemical data demonstrate that a wide spectrum of fracturing mechanisms can affect the fracture network of intrusions. We employ digital fracture mapping on high-resolution digital outcrop models to quantify the effect of these processes on fracture network properties. Based on the results, we draw the following conclusions:\n\n\u2022\nWe identify four different fracture types present in sills, driven by a broad spectrum of physical processes. These include (1) cooling joints created by thermal contraction, (2) faults and associated tectonic fractures, (3) bitumen dykes and bituminous shale injection structures, and (4) hydrothermal veins, likely due to hydrofracturing initiated in the metamorphic aureole.\n\n\n\u2022\nExcept for tectonic fractures, the fracture network is established during the early phase dominated by a high-temperature environment. Evidence suggests that in this phase, hydrocarbons generated may be mobilized and migrate into the intrusion and experience temperatures of several hundred degrees, where in-situ combustion of volatiles and graphitization of solid bitumen takes place.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe observe the different fracture types throughout the outcrop, but they do not occur spatially homogenous. Instead, the fracture network properties exhibit strong lateral changes on the scale of some tens to hundreds of meters, depending on the number and intensity of processes involved. Such changes involve locally increased fracture density, wider orientation distribution, higher connectivity and a variable length distribution.\n\n\n\u2022\nComparison of different mathematical distributions shows that fracture lengths are best represented through a spatially varying log-normal distribution, although even this is not overall satisfactory. Our analysis also demonstrates that previously suggested power-law behavior is very unlikely and difficult to justify considering the various physical processes at work.\n\n\n\u2022\nStrong variations in fracture network properties imply similar heterogeneities for petrophysical and geophysical properties, such as locally enhanced storage capacity and fracture permeability or reduced seismic velocities.\n\n\n\nOverall, this study extends our understanding of fracture networks in igneous intrusions acting as petroleum reservoirs and provides numerous field examples and quantitative data. The El Manzano field analogue can thus be used help geoscientists of all disciplines to better constrain modeling efforts and develop a more practical understanding of subsurface igneous petroleum systems.\n\n\nFunding\nFor this work we received funding by through several grants of the University of Oslo (Universitetet i Oslo) and the Research Council of Norway: Earthflows initiative (grant no. 267775), DIPS project (grant no. 240467), and DEEP Research School (249040\/F60).

These studies have described complex deformation along numerous large-scale continental strike-slip faults, such as the San Andreas Fault (e.g., Anderson 1971.; Wallace, 1990), the Alpine Fault of New Zealand (e.g., Berryman et al., 1992), the North Anatolian Fault (e.g., Aramijo et al., 1999; Neugebauer, 1994), Dead Sea Fault system (e.g., Perin\u00e7ek and \u00c7emen, 1990; Smit et al., 2008), the Tibetan region and in Indochina (e.g., Chen et al., 2000; Morley, 2013), the Fagnano or the North Scotia Fault of South America (e.g., Lodolo et al., 2003), the Periadriatic Fault of the Alps, or the Mid-Hungarian Fault Zone of the Pannonian basin (e.g., Schmid et al., 2020). Many of these faults are associated with transpressional orogens or transtensive basins of various geometries and degrees of curvature in map view (e.g., Christie-Blick and Biddle, 1985; Dewey et al., 1998; Smit et al., 2008, 2010, among others). In these settings, the term strain partitioning has often been used in different ways and at different spatial scales to describe the large variability of observed deformation (e.g., Fitch, 1972; Lister and Williams, 1983; Platt, 1993; Carreras et al., 2013). Similar with other studies (Glen, 2004; Cembrano et al., 2005; De Vicente et al., 2009; D'el-Rey Silva et al., 2011; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013; Benesh et al., 2014), we use the term \u201cstrain partitioning\u201d to describe a multi-scale distribution of bulk strain into genetically different and coeval structures that cannot be explained by a uniform stress field.\nAnalogue and numerical modelling studies have demonstrated that the initiation and evolution of strike-slip corridors are always accompanied with significant strain partitioning, such as between Riedel shears and the main strike-slip fault (e.g. Leever et al., 2011; Dooley and Schreurs, 2012; Stefanov and Bakeev, 2014; Chemenda et al., 2016; Hatem et al., 2017; Iturrieta et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017). This strain partitioning is associated with significant local stress deviations and is more pronounced when either the movement is oblique to the main strike-slip fault, creating restraining and releasing bends with various geometries (e.g., Basile and Brun, 1999; McClay and Bonora, 2001; Smit et al., 2008; Leever et al., 2011; Dooley and Schreurs, 2012; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017; Nabavi et al., 2018), or when the strike-slip fault has a curved geometry (e.g., Smit et al., 2010; Dufr\u00e9chou et al., 2011). Furthermore, more complex systems of interacting thrusts and strike-slip faults have been observed or modelled (e.g., Duarte et al., 2011; Rosas et al., 2012, 2015; Fedorik et al., 2019). These studies have also shown that strain partitioning creates a gradual transfer of deformation from contraction to transpression and strike-slip. Other experimental studies have focused on deformation in front of an indenter (e.g., Marshak, 1988; Marshak et al., 1992; Zweigel, 1998 and references therein), where strike-slip deformation accommodates lateral extrusion (Tapponnier et al., 1982; Ratschbacher et al., 1991a, b; van Gelder et al., 2017). Often, strike-slip deformation links shortening in front of the indenter with deformation in another subduction system, such as observed in the Dinarides orogen connecting the shortening in the Alps with Aegean subduction (van Unen et al., 2019), or the Sagaing Fault linking the shortening in the Himalayas with the Sunda subduction zone (e.g., Tapponnier et al., 1986; Morley, 2002; Sternai et al., 2016). In such settings, the geometry and motion of the indenter influences significantly the deformation and structural response around the rigid indenter (Luth et al., 2013). However, the structural link (i.e., kinematics and geometry of major structures) between frontal, usually contractional, and lateral strike-slip deformation around the corner of an indenter is still not well understood.\nOne of the best examples of strain partitioning along curved strike-slip faults is the one of the Oligocene \u2013 middle Miocene Cerna-Timok fault system of the Carpatho-Balkanides orogen in South-Eastern Europe (Fig. 1\n). Previous studies have shown that this system has cumulated 100\u00a0km of dextral offset and links the deformation observed around the Moesian Platform (i.e., a rigid promontory in the prolongation of the East European Craton) along a 180\u00b0 backarc-convex orocline connecting the South Carpathians, Serbian Carpathians and Balkanides (Fig. 1, e.g., Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2003; Schmid et al., 2020, and references therein). These studies have also shown that the same system transfers strike-slip deformation to thrusting and extension with variable offsets along its strike.\nWe aim to advance our understanding of the major parameters controlling strain partitioning and deformation transfer around indenters, with particular application to the Cerna-Timok fault system and associated deformation. To this aim, we performed a series of analogue experiments designed to analyse the deformational response to the shape of the rigid indenter (rounded or rectangular corners), the displacement (translation followed by rotation) along the margins of a rigid indenter and the rheological stratification of the deformable area. With respect to the latter, we analysed the influence of the flow in the ductile crust on the transfer and distribution of deformation. We use image correlation techniques for the detailed analysis of deformation around indenter corners in various experimental setups in order to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the influence of their geometries on the deformation transfer. We compare the modelling results with the Cerna-Timok fault system of the Carpatho-Balkanides, which allows a detailed understanding of strain partitioning mechanisms during its Oligocene \u2013 middle Miocene evolution. We have chosen a strategy in the presentation of our results that involves first the description of a reference model with a simple analogue modelling setup, followed by a parametrical study of other models with a more complex initial geometry or composition. In a separate section we show the relevance of a chosen best-fit model for understanding the evolution of the Cerna-Timok faults system and the associated Carpatho-Balkanides oroclinal bending. All modelling results are subsequently discussed in a process-oriented context.\n\n\n2\nThe Cerna-Timok fault system of the Carpatho-Balkanides orogen\nThe European area connecting the Carpathians and Balkanides orogenic system (Fig. 1a and b) shows a thick-skinned nappe-stack that was formed during two phases of Cretaceous shortening related to the closure of the Ceahl\u0103u-Severin branch of the Alpine Tethys Ocean and the subsequent collision between the Dacia mega-unit and the Moesian promontory of the stable European foreland (S\u0103ndulescu, 1988; Bojar et al., 1998; Csontos and V\u00f6r\u00f6s, 2004; Iancu et al., 2005; Schmid et al., 2008, 2020; Ma\u0163enco, 2017). The present-day geometry of the orogenic system shows two 180\u00b0 curved loops, one in the north and east, and another in the south (Fig. 1a). This geometry was ultimately established during the Miocene slab retreat and gradual closure of the Carpathians embayment, consisting of oceanic crust and the continental passive margin of the Alpine Tethys Ocean (Fig. 1b, e g., Csontos and V\u00f6r\u00f6s, 2004; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, 2005). The southern 180\u00b0 arc connects the South Carpathians, the Serbian Carpathians and the Balkanides by creating an orocline with a back-arc convex geometry bent around the Moesian Platform (Fig. 1a and b). The oroclinal bending formed by gradual clockwise rotation and N- to E-ward translation of the Dacia mega-unit during its movement into the Carpathians embayment. The post-Cretaceous rotation was significant (up to 90\u00b0) in the South Carpathians when compared to no significant rotation in the Balkanides (e.g., Balla, 1987; P\u0103tra\u015fcu et al., 1994; M\u00e1rton, 2000; Ustaszewski et al., 2008; van Hinsbergen et al., 2008; Panaiotu and Panaiotu, 2010).\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that the clockwise rotation was first accommodated by Paleocene \u2013 Eocene orogen-parallel extension in the South Carpathians (Matenco and Schmid, 1999; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, 2005; Schmid et al., 1998) and subsequently by the evolution of the late Oligocene \u2013 middle Miocene curved dextral Cerna and Timok faults system (Fig. 1c, Berza and Dr\u0103ganescu, 1988; Ratschbacher et al., 1993; Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2002). Tectonic and lithological markers show that the Cerna Fault (CF) accommodates up to 35\u00a0km of dextral offset, as documented by the distance observed between the Godeanu and Bahna klippen, or between the Tisovita-Iuti and Deli Jovan ophiolites (Fig. 1c, Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2003). In comparison, the Timok Fault (TF) has up to 65\u00a0km dextral offset, inferred by the distance observed between the Deli Jovan and Zaglavak ophiolites (Fig. 1c, Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2003). These faults and their associated structures create a complex deformation system that was inferred to connect the strike-slip, thrusting and extensional deformation around the western margin of Moesia from the Balkanides to the South Carpathians via the Serbian Carpathians (Fig. 1c, Schmid et al., 2020).\nOne interesting feature of the Cerna \u2013 Timok faults system is the formation of Oligocene \u2013 Miocene sedimentary basins observed along their strike, such as the Oligocene Petro\u0219ani, or the Miocene Timok - Knja\u017eevac basins system (Fig. 1c). These triangular basins are syn-kinematic with respect to strike-slip deformation and formed during the gradual indentation and rotation around the Moesian indenter (e.g., Ratschbacher et al., 1993; Kr\u00e4utner and Krstic, 2002; Schmid et al., 2020). The Timok - Knja\u017eevac basins system reaches ~17\u00a0km in width southwards and is ~98\u00a0km in length. To the north, the Timok Fault connects with the late Oligocene - early Miocene transtensional opening of the South Carpathians foredeep (Fig. 1c, the Getic Depression of R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011; Krezsek et al., 2013).\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nModelling approach\nWe present a series of 12 crustal scale analogue experiments that portray deformation of the upper to middle crust around a rigid indenter as a consequence of translation and rotation of the material surrounding it. Compared to previous indentation experiments where a rigid indenter is pushed into the model layers (e.g., Tapponnier et al., 1982; Davy and Cobbold, 1988; Ratschbacher et al., 1991a; Luth et al., 2013), our approach has a changed reference frame where the indenter is fixed, while the deformable material moves around it. As such, it allows direct investigation of the variability of deformation styles as a function of position relative to a fixed indenter (i.e., shortening dominated structures orthogonal to the indenter margin and strike-slip dominated structures parallel to the indenter margin) and, in technical sense, provides more flexibility for implementing kinematic boundary conditions (see below) that are relevant for the comparison of modelling results with the natural case, the Carpatho-Balkanides (Fig. 1). Against the background of the natural example, the key parameters of this study include the shape of the indenter, the rheological stratification of the model crust and the addition of a rotational component of deformation to account for clockwise rotations of 5\u201310\u00b0 in Oligocene-Miocene times (Marovi\u0107 et al., 2002).\n\n\n3.2\nKinematic and geometric setup of the analogue models\nAll models contain a fixed rigid block, the indenter, with the upper width of 26\u00a0cm (Fig. 2\na and b), which is scaled to the size (in the N\u2013S direction) of the Moesian Platform in nature (Fig. 1). The indenter is surrounded by deformable layer(s) of brittle or brittle-viscous materials representing the upper to middle crust (Fig. 2). For the description of the modelling setup as well as the modelling results, a relative geographic reference frame with the north oriented upwards is adopted (Fig. 2).\nThe model indenter is represented by a 2\u00a0cm thick stiff polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plate and has either rounded corners (Fig. 2a), or a rectangular geometry (Fig. 2b). The margins of either block have an inclination of 35\u00b0 dipping towards the surrounding deformable region (Fig. 2d). This inclination approximates the structure at the base of the Cretaceous nappes thrusted over the Moesian promontory (Fig. 1c); Ma\u0163enco (2017) and references therein), representing an inherited feature in the model.\nThe deformable part of the model is underlain by two basal plastic plates\/sheets (Fig. 2). The first, 1\u00a0mm thick plastic plate (green in Fig. 2), underlies the entire model (including the rigid block), is mobile and is attached to a motor (through a bar that is connected to the model and motor by mechanical joints). The motor pulls it northward with a constant velocity of 10\u00a0cm\/h or 2\u00a0cm\/h for brittle only or brittle-viscous models, respectively. Depending on the specific model boundary conditions, this plastic plate is either only translated or translated and rotated. The rotation is achieved around a pole of rotation represented by a stationary pin protruding from below the indenter (fixed pin in Fig. 2). In our experiments, the fixed pin is located at the northern end of the straight segment of rounded indenter's western margin or at the north-western corner of the rectangular shaped indenter (Fig. 2a\u2013c). The mobile plastic plate has a cut in the middle in the north-south direction (dashed green line in Fig. 2) to enable the sliding and rotation of the mobile plate along a stationary pin (Fig. 2). This construction allows for a combined translational-rotational movement of the mobile plate. The second, 0.1\u00a0mm thick plastic sheet (grey in Fig. 2), is fixed and overlies the moving plate north of the rigid block, while underlying this moving plate to the north-west. This change takes place at the cut in the moving plate. We have chosen this configuration to prevent deformation north of the rigid block, where, otherwise, extension along the northern edge of the indenter would take place. At the same time, the area to the north-west of the rigid block is free to move. This setup predefines velocity discontinuities (VD) along the southern and western margins of the rigid block and along the contact between the moving plate and fixed plastic sheet (Fig. 2a\u2013c). All experiments are confined laterally by either guiding bars or sand (Fig. 2a and b), which in the case of brittle-viscous experiments prevent the viscous layer to induce boundary effects by lateral flow outside the model area.\nIn experiments with no rotation (Table 1\n), the northward displacement of the mobile plate is 9\u00a0cm. For experiments with rotation (Table 1), we apply a stepwise approach by following previous experimental studies (Farangitakis et al., 2019, 2021). An initial 4\u00a0cm of northward translation is followed by a phase of combined translation and rotation. The purpose of these two phases of imposed kinematics is to create strike-slip deformation (in the first phase) and to study influence of coupled rotation and translation (the second-phase) on the pre-existing strike-slip faults. This complex movement of the mobile plate is guided by a fixed bar located in the north (Fig. 2a\u2013c). During the experiment, when the mobile plate hits the rotation guide bar, we remove the lateral translation guide bars to enable the combined rotational and translational movement (Fig. 2c). The total clockwise rotation reaches 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 in different models (Table 1). Similar to experiments with no rotation, the total northward displacement of the moving plate along the western margin of the rigid block is 9\u00a0cm (Fig. 2c).\nThe experiments presented in this study are subdivided in two groups. Group 1 (models 1\u20136) consists of experiments with rounded indenters whereas group 2 experiments (models 7\u201312) are characterized by rectangular indenters (Table 1). These distinct indenter geometries allow to quantitatively and qualitatively compare effects of corner geometry in cases where deformation is gradually transferred (rounded corners) and where the deformation transfer is more abrupt (90\u00b0 corners). For each of these groups we performed experiments with and without a rotational component applied to the deformable area surrounding the indenter as well as of brittle and brittle-viscous composition, respectively.\n\n\n3.3\nModel materials and scaling\nIn our models, the brittle layer consists of dry quartz sand with a bulk density of \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a01500\u00a0kg\/m3, a cohesion of 10\u201340\u00a0Pa and coefficients of friction of 0.63, 0.48 and 0.52, representing peak, dynamic and reactivation friction, respectively (Willingshofer et al., 2018). The sand has a grain-size spread of 100\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm and exhibits Mohr-Coulomb behaviour, which makes it a suitable analogue for natural brittle upper crust (Krantz, 1991; Dooley and Schreurs, 2012; Klinkm\u00fcller et al., 2016; Schellart and Strak, 2016). Thin marker horizons of coloured quartz sand were used as passive markers to show vertical offsets along faults in cross-sections, while horizontal offsets are tracked by passive maker lines of black and yellow quartz sand placed on the model upper surface.\nThe viscous layer in brittle-viscous models is the analogue of the ductile crust below the brittle-ductile transition. It consists of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS silicon polymer) putty, mixed with iron powder and quartz sand as fillers in order to increase the density of pure PDMS (i.e., 970\u00a0kg\/m3) to a value close to the bulk density of overlying quartz sand layer. This viscous mixture has a density of \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a01470\u00a0kg\/m3 and viscosity of 3.8\u2219104\u00a0Pas at room temperature. The viscosity of the viscous mixture has been determined with a coni-cylindrical viscometer. An n-value of 1.2 indicates slightly non-Newtonian behavior. We assume that for low stresses and low strain rates (i.e., similar to those used in analogue models) behavior of the viscous mixture is essentially Newtonian (e.g., Broerse et al., 2019; Rudolf et al., 2016; Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986).\nScaling of all models follows the principles of geometrical, rheological and kinematical similarities between natural systems and models (Hubbert, 1937; Ramberg, 1981; Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986; Davy and Cobbold, 1991). Densities of our material of 1500\u00a0kg\/m3 represent natural upper to middle crust densities of 2750\u00a0kg\/m3, yielding a density-scale ratio \u03c1* (\u03c1model\/\u03c1nature) of 0.55. The length scale in our experiments is such that 1\u00a0cm in model corresponds to 7\u00a0km in nature, yielding a length-scale ratio L* (Lmodel\/Lnature) of 1.43\u221910\u22126. We choose the length scale ratio such that the brittle-viscous transition in the models is at a depth of ca. 10\u00a0km when scaled to nature. This depth of the brittle-viscous transition is consistent with a change in deformation behavior of quartz-dominated lithologies from frictional sliding to creep (e.g., Kerrich et al., 1997; van der Pluijm and Marshak, 2004) for average continental geo-thermal gradients in the order of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Turcotte and Schubert; 2014; Limberger et al., 2014, 2018) and the depth extent of weak seismicity documented in the South- and Serbian Carpathians (e.g., Dimitrijevic, 1994; Popa et al., 2018). At this depth the vertical stress (i.e., lithostatic stress, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c1\u2219g\u2219h, where \u03c1 is quartz sand density, g is gravitational acceleration and h is the thickness of overlying sand layer) in the experiments is 220\u00a0Pa, corresponding to 280\u00a0MPa in nature, which results in a stress-scale ratio of 7.87\u221910\u22127. Strength profiles (Fig. 2e and f) are representative for the initial conditions and have been calculated following Brun (2002). To scale model velocity in brittle-viscous models, we use a time-scale ratio t*\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u221910\u221211 calculated as (Hubbert, 1937):\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nt\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n1\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile shear strain rate ratio \n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n\u2217\n\n\n equals:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n\n\nV\n\u2217\n\n\nL\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere velocity ratio V*\u00a0=\u00a02.7\u2219104 means that 2\u00a0cm\/h in models scales to 0.65\u00a0cm\/yr in nature, which is consistent with the 60\u201365\u00a0km displacement along the Timok fault over a period of ca. 10 Myr (e.g., Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2003; Schmid et al., 2020). Note that the shear strain rate is calculated as velocity over the thickness of the viscous layer. For the calculated experimental velocities, the viscosity of the modelling material scales to natural viscosities of ~1021\u00a0Pas, which is in the range of quartz dominated ductile crust below the brittle-ductile transition (e.g. Hirth et al., 2001).\n\n\n3.4\nExperimental procedures, recordings and PIV-derived strain analysis\nModels are built and run in a normal gravity field and at room temperature (i.e., 19\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C). An electric motor imposes a constant velocity on the mobile plastic sheet. Depressions deeper than 1\u00a0mm are filled manually, using a funnel, with alternating layers of differently coloured sand, representing syn-kinematic sedimentation. At the end of each experiment, two post-kinematic layers of black and white sand are added on top of the entire model to preserve topography and water is sprinkled on the sand layers to increase cohesion within the sand and to allow for sectioning of the experiments to obtain information on the internal structures.\nWe monitor surface deformation by taking top-view photographs (by using Panasonic Lumix DC-G9 with 20.3 megapixels for models 1\u20136 and 10\u201312 and Canon EOS 700D with 18.0 Megapixels for models 7\u20139) at regular time intervals of 45\u00a0s for brittle only experiments, and 3\u00a0min for brittle-viscous models, corresponding to 0.125\u00a0cm and 0.1\u00a0cm of translation displacement between two photographs, respectively. These top-view photographs are analysed using image correlation techniques (PIVlab, Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014) in order to calculate incremental particle displacements. Subsequently, we remove very large displacements due to incorrect correlations by applying a magnitude threshold filter, followed by a visual inspection for remaining outliers and their manual removal and interpolation of displacements in basin areas for time frames when sedimentation is applied (i.e., only for few time frames in a model). Displacements for these time frames are interpolated taking displacement values on the margin of basins unaffected by sedimentation. The image correlation provides the displacement fields in a fixed spatial reference frame. However, model materials show large motions through this spatial frame. We therefore also track material by defining an initial regular grid that deforms at each time step using the interpolated, spatial displacement fields (i.e., Lagrangian summation, similar to Senatore et al., 2013; Stanier et al., 2016; Boutelier et al., 2019; Kr\u00fdza et al., 2019). From the material displacements the incremental deformation field is calculated (Supplementary Appendix A, D). As the deformation is large, small strain definitions are no longer valid (Malvern, 1969). Therefore, we describe the finite deformation as a product of the stretch tensor (corresponding to the shape change), and a rotation tensor, using a polar decomposition of the finite deformation gradient tensor (Broerse et al., 2021). Note that the principal stretches (\u03bbi) relate to principal strains (\u03b5i) as: \u03bbi\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b5i.\nFor small, incremental strains one can use the ratio of the largest to the smallest principal strain to determine a strain type in the horizontal plane: extension, strike-slip, shortening and their transitions (Kreemer et al., 2014). From Broerse et al. (2021) it follows that, for the mentioned types of strain, the logarithms of principal stretches for large deformation have the same ratios as incremental small strains. Therefore, we use the logarithmic principal stretches to determine the average strain type during model evolution (see Supplementary Appendix B, E; see also Broerse et al., 2021). While in 3D, faulting always involves shear on fault planes, in horizontal view only strike-slip faulting is a purely shear; thrust faulting will appear as shortening in 2D, while normal faults appear as extensional features. Our approach relies on the assumption that the surface deformation is not affected by subsequent phases of opposite deformation. If inversion of deformation occurs, the analysis should be divided in separate periods. Finally, these results are combined with visual interpretations of cross-sections to infer 2D strain in the entire, 3D model.\n\n\n3.5\nExperimental limitations and simplification\nThe analogue models presented in this study do not account for isostasy, temperature gradients with depth (i.e., viscosity of the viscous layer is constant, which is an acceptable approximation following Davy and Cobbold, 1991), surface erosion and sediment transport. Therefore, topographic heights are exaggerated in the contractional area in front of the indenter. Despite these limitations, we are confident that the modelling results are meaningful, because we mostly focus on the area of the model where significant deformation is by strike-slip, which generally produces little thermal perturbations as well as low topography changes. Le Guerrou\u00e9 and Cobbold (2006) demonstrated that syn-kinematic erosion and\/or sedimentation in a strike-slip setting only have minor effects on structural patterns, yet the results have been obtained at higher spatial resolution. As such, minor differences in structural patterns within strike-slip zones with or without syn-kinematic sedimentation are not significant on the scale of our models. Therefore, surface processes are in our view not among the controlling factors during the oroclinal bending of the Carpatho-Balkanides.\nCompared to the natural case of the Serbian Carpathians and its Cretaceous inherited structures (Fig. 1c), our models do not have inherited topography and\/or a wedge structure (i.e., and inherited mountainous fold and thrust belt) in the deformable part of the model prior to deformation. This simplification is justified because the Cerna-Timok fault system offsets the inherited Cretaceous nappe stack and Paleocene-Eocene Danubian extensional dome in the Serbian and South Carpathians (e.g., Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2003; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, 2005) and do not represent reactivated nappe contacts. Such simplification allows studying first-order structural responses to the varied parameters without complex overprinting interactions with earlier deformation.\n\n\n\n4\nThe reference model and parametrical study\nThe results are described starting with a detailed analysis of a \u201creference model\u201d (Model 1, Fig. 3\n), to which we compare the results of a parametric study (Figs. 4\u20137\n\n\n\n) and the best-fit model (Fig. 8\n). The latter serves to demonstrate the relevance of the modelling results for the evolution of the Cerna-Timok fault system and the associated Carpatho-Balkanides oroclinal bending. Note that the transpressional deformation in the northernmost segment of all models (i.e., at larger distances from the pole of rotation), results from the modelling setup (N\u2013S oriented velocity discontinuity, Fig. 5) and is not relevant for the comparison with the natural case of the Carpatho-Balkanides.\nModelling results are described based on the structural interpretation of top-view photographs and cross-sections and results of digital image correlation methods documenting the variability of strain regimes in map-view (Figs. 3\u20135 and 8). Furthermore, we use time-lapse top-view videos of incremental strain components and cumulative strain type, available in the Supplementary Appendix A, B, D, E and temporal evolution of selected grid cells (Supplementary Appendix C and F) to derive and explain detailed fault kinematics and their interplay during deformation.\n\n4.1\nReference model: model 1\nModel 1 consists of a rigid indenter with rounded corners, while the surrounding, deformable material is entirely brittle (Table 1, Fig. 2a, e). Deformation results only from northward translation of the model layers.\nModel 1 (Fig. 3) documents the development of distinct strain regimes in time, which are characterized by predominantly strike-slip deformation along the N\u2013S oriented flank of the indenter, transpression along the curved indenter segment and contraction at the E-W striking margin of the indenter. The partitioning into these deformation regimes takes place during the entire experiment, although structural complexity increases through time (Fig. 3; see also Supplementary Appendix A and B that show the incremental 2D strain with time and the evolution of average strain type).\n\n4.1.1\nEarly stages\nIn the early stages of the experiment, deformation is localized along the western and southern margins of the indenter (Fig. 3a and b). In particular, strike-slip deformation localized along the western indenter margin interface, while being distributed above the VD (see Supplementary Appendix A, B). This suggests that lower vertical stress levels above the ramp facilitate the onset of deformation at this location (structure 1 in Fig. 3a). However, a new strike-slip fault zone forms afterwards (structure 2 in Fig. 3a) above the lower edge of the indenter's inclined margin that coincides with the basal VD. NNE-SSW oriented Riedel shears (R in Fig. 3a) are related to the northward translation of the mobile sheet, suggesting early strain partitioning. As the shear zone in the north evolves, an area of transtensional strain (light blue shades in Fig. 3b), related to dilation during shearing is bounded by areas which underwent slight shortening and transpression (pale red, orange and yellow values in Fig. 3b). This shear zone develops into a positive flower structure in the north, with oblique-slip thrusts bounding the strike-slip corridor (Fig. 3c\u2013f). Along the western margin of the rigid block, the deformation after 1\u00a0cm of displacement is mostly accommodated by the two early formed N\u2013S oriented strike-slip faults (1 and 2 in Fig. 3a). In the early stages of deformation, these two faults are connected around the SW corner of the indenter to the E-W oriented shortening domain in the south. This connection is achieved through a basal thrust along the pre-existing indenter ramp and a back-thrusting system where the offset is initiated at the toe of the ramp (Fig. 3a, g). The overall system transfers N\u2013S strike-slip into E-W oriented thrusts and back-thrusts (Fig. 3b).\n\n\n4.1.2\nFormation of the main N\u2013S oriented strike-slip fault\nAfter approximately 4\u00a0cm of displacement of the mobile sheet (Fig. 3c and d), all Riedel shears are connected and the main N\u2013S oriented strike-slip fault (structure 2) represents a thoroughgoing strike-slip system. This structure is characterized by a change in fault dip angle, from sub-vertical in the north to steeply eastward-dipping in the south (e.g., compare cross-sections a-a\u2019, b-b\u2019 and c-c\u2019 in Fig. 3g), consistent with a southward increase of the reverse component of movement (Fig. 3g). Overall, the deformation zone gets wider southwards when approaching the rounded corner of the indenter (Fig. 3e), as the cumulated deformation is changing from strike-slip and transtension in the north to strike-slip and transpression in the south (Fig. 3f\u2013g). Furthermore, the final dextral offset along the main strike-slip fault (structure 2) decreases towards south from ~6\u00a0cm to <2\u00a0cm (see the offset in black and yellow marker lines in top view, Fig. 3e).\nThe initial strike-slip structure (1 in Fig. 3e and f) and the main strike-slip fault (2 in Fig. 3e and f) are connected by obliquely oriented thrusts in map view (3 and 4 in Fig. 3c\u2013f, cross-section b-b\u2019 in Fig. 3g) and NNW-SSE oriented strike-slip faults (5 and 6 in Fig. 3e and f, cross-section b-b\u2019 in Fig. 3g). These thrusts develop on top of the inclined margin, adding to the complexity in the strain pattern in the central segment of the model (Fig. 3f), where strain is partitioned between top to N shortening (red along 3 and 4 in Fig. 3f), strike-slip (green) and transtension (light blue values) in the centre of the deformation zone (structures 5 and 6 in Fig. 3f), while bounded by transpressional deformation (orange values along 1 and 2 in Fig. 3f).\n\n\n4.1.3\nTransition between strike-slip and thrusting\nThe SW corner of the rigid block (Fig. 3e and f, cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 3g) represents the area where strike-slip deformation transitions to thrusting with significant changes of fault orientations. The strike of major structures follows the predefined curvature of the rigid block resulting in curved geometries of the back-thrusts and the normal faults. Back-thrusting is transferred directly to the strike-slip deformation, demonstrating oblique dextral reverse slip in the bending zone (Fig. 3a\u2013f). This connection evolves sequentially as the main strike-slip fault propagates farther to the south to connect with newly formed back thrust (see Supplementary Appendix A, B). N-dipping normal faults are linked with the main strike-slip fault (structure 2) through NNW-SSE oriented dextral faults (5 and 6 in Fig. 3e and f), while the basal thrust remains linked to the oblique strike-slip fault along the western edge of the indenter (1 in Fig. 3e and f). This gradual transfer is further marked by a decrease in contractional or extensional strain, characterizing an area of distributed deformation without clear faulting (decrease in red and blue intensity westward along the basal thrust, in the region of the gravitational collapse and back-thrust system in Fig. 3f). In this area the strain type changes from shortening and extension in the south (red and blue in Fig. 3f, respectively) to oblique-slip (orange, yellow, light blue values) and strike-slip (green) in the west. This change is associated with a decrease in vertical offset in the back-thrust system from 3.3\u00a0cm in the south (cross-section e-e\u2019 in Fig. 3g) to 1.9\u00a0cm in the SW corner area (cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 3f). Minor E\u2212 and W- dipping normal faults in the bending region (Fig. 3e\u2013g, cross-sections c-c\u2019 and d-d\u2019) display very small offsets, accommodating the topographic transition from elevated shortening dominated wedge south of the indenter to strike-slip dominated low-topography structures to the west of the indenter.\nDirectly south of the indenter, the displacement is perpendicular to the rigid block. In this part of the system, the inclined margin acts as a thrust ramp, along which material has been transported on top of the rigid block, resembling a flat-ramp-flat geometry (Fig. 3g, cross-section e-e\u2019) or Coulomb wedge model with fore- and retro-wedges (e.g., Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen et al., 1984; Del Castello et al., 2004). The final strain type map (Fig. 3f) demonstrates that most thrusting deformation is accommodated along the basal thrust (see also cross-sections d-d\u2019 and e-e\u2019 in Fig. 3g). The S-verging back-thrusts are partly re-activated as N-dipping normal faults to accommodate the change in geometry of the basal thrust from the ramp to the flat segment (Fig. 3e and f, cross-section e-e\u2019 in Fig. 3g; see also Supplementary Appendix C).\n\n\n\n4.2\nParametrical study\nIn the following sections we provide a concise overview of modelling results for the parameter space explored in this study. We start with highlighting similarities and differences of modelling results for different indenter geometries (Figs. 3\u20135) and amount of rotation for set-ups where the crust consists of brittle material only (Fig. 5). Thereafter, we describe the results for models with brittle-ductile rheological stratification, for which we similarly vary the indenter shape and amount of rotation (Fig. 5). Next to displaying the modelling results as interpreted top-view images, cross sections or strain maps (see also M1), histogram diagrams are used for the quantitative analysis of modelling results relating the size (i.e., width, of strike-slip dominated shear zone, width, length and depth of basin, width and height of orogen) of structural features to the tested parameters (Figs. 6 and 7).\n\n4.2.1\nThe influence of the indenter geometry\nOur analysis of models with rounded (M1) and rectangular (M7) indenter corners subject to translational kinematic boundary conditions (Figs. 3, 4 and 5a, b) show that the indenter geometry significantly influences the geometry and kinematics of strike-slip zones and their transition to the E-W oriented thrust systems (compare Fig. 5a and b).\nIn case of rounded indenter corners the strike-slip system along the western margin is distributed over a wider area compared to models with rectangular corners (Figs. 3 and 4). In particular, the average width of the strike-slip zone is 4.6\u00a0cm in M1, while it is 1\u00a0cm in M7 (Figs. 5 and 6a). This difference is a consequence of how the strike-slip and thrust domains connect. For rounded indenters it is the first back-thrust of the thrust domain that connects with the major strike-slip fault that develops at the VD along the western indenter margin (Fig. 3a and b), whereas it is the basal fore-thrust that connects with the strike-slip fault along the upper indenter-model boundary in the case of the rectangular indenter (Fig. 4a and b). The latter is probably an effect of stress concentration at indenter corners localizing deformation close to the sand-indenter boundary (Fig. 4). This difference in model evolution has major implications for the style and kinematics of deformation at the transition of the strike-slip to the thrusting domain where M1 shows a gradual change from thrusting to strike-slip deformation (Fig. 3e and f). In contrast, this transition is abrupt in M7 and defined by an array of small dextral faults with an important normal slip component (Fig. 4). These faults link to displacement along the main strike-slip fault zone cutting the evolving thrust wedge (Fig. 4c and d).\nThese first-order features are also observed when combining translation with rotation of the moving sheet (Fig. 5 e, f, i, j) and are less pronounced when adding a viscous layer at the bottom of the models (Fig. 5c, d, g, h, k, l).\n\n\n4.2.2\nThe influence of imposed rotation\nIncluding rotation leads to a systematic widening of the deformed area, particularly of the strike-slip dominated domain (Fig. 5). This effect is more pronounced when indenter corners are rectangular. For example, when comparing models with rectangular corners (Fig. 5b, f, j), the average strike-slip zone width in models with no rotation is as low as 1\u00a0cm (model 7), ~4\u00a0cm for 5\u00b0 of rotation (M8) and ~6\u00a0cm for models with 10\u00b0 rotation (M9; Fig. 6a). These differences are related to the scissor-style opening of, in map-view, triangular-shaped transtensional basins above the basal velocity discontinuity (Figs. 5 and 7). As such these basins are narrower and shallower in the north but wider and deeper in the south where the extensional component is largest (M8 and M9, Figs. 6 and 7). Progressive rotation also induces the formation of new strike-slip faults with normal component of slip (e.g., fault 7 in Fig. 5j) within the evolving sedimentary basin, which cut into the orogenic wedge at the transition zone. Furthermore, the orogenic wedge gets lower and less wide with increasing amount of rotation for both, models with rounded and rectangular indenter corners (Fig. 6b).\nModels with curved indenter also show widening of the deformation zone away from the rotation pole, which is, however, less pronounced compared to models with rectangular corners (compare M2 and M3 with M8 and M9, Fig. 5). Consequently, these transtensional basins are smaller and less deep (width: 1.2\u20132.6\u00a0cm, length: 5.0\u201310.0\u00a0cm, depth: 0.3\u20130.4\u00a0cm; Fig. 7). Similar to models with rectangular corners, widening of the strike-slip deformation zone is also associated with the formation of new faults that link this zone to the thrust wedge (e.g., fault 4 in Fig. 5k).\n\n\n4.2.3\nThe influence of rheology: brittle-only vs. brittle-viscous rheology\nIn models with a viscous layer, deformation is distributed over a wider area but a smaller number of discrete structures is formed that accommodate the motion of the underlying plate (Figs. 5 and 6). The evolution of first-order structural patterns is similar in brittle and brittle-viscous experiments, especially along the western margin of the indenter. The influence of the viscous crust is particularly obvious at the southern and northern margins of the indenter, where the transfer of deformation is more gradual. Also, notably less structures accommodate shortening south of the indenter, while north of the indenter new structures (i.e., splaying off of the main strike-slip zone; Fig. 5) form that do not exist in brittle-only models. Comparing M7 with M10 shows that main the dextral shear zone evolves on top of the velocity discontinuity in M10 and thus at a distance from the boundary between the rigid indenter and the sand layers. This suggests that flow in the viscous layer has a de-localizing affect.\nThe viscous layer does not have a significant influence on the width of the transtensional basins along the western margin of the indenter, although the basins are slightly larger (especially longer) (Fig. 7a). The viscous layer controls the geometry of the basin (Fig. 7b), allowing the transfer of deformation around the NW corner of the indenter creating oblique-slip normal faults (splaying in Fig. 5d, g, h, k, l, 7b). These oblique-slip faults control the subsidence in this NE-SW to E-W oriented basin north of the indenter, which is connected to the main N\u2013S oriented basin along the western margin (Figs. 5 and 7b).\nThe orogenic wedge at the southern margin of the indenter is systematically wider but is not systematically different in height for models with viscous rheology (Fig. 6b). The associated faulting patterns is characterized by a few discrete structures (on average 1\u20132 fore-thrusts and up to 2 back-thrusts) additional to a multitude of low offset structures appearing as \u201cwrinkles\u201d on the model surface (Fig. 5).\n\n\n\n\n5\nThe best-fit model for the Cerna-Timok system and associated Carpatho-Balkanides oroclinal bending\nAmong all modelling scenarios (Fig. 5), the one that simulates most closely the evolution and geometry of the Cerna-Timok fault system and the associated oroclinal bending is model 6, hereafter referred as the \u201cbest-fit\u201d model. This model consists of a rigid block with rounded corners and a brittle-viscous rheology (Table 1, Fig. 2a, c, f), where kinematic boundary conditions are applied in two stages. After four centimetres of northward translation (i.e., the first stage), a total 10\u00b0 clockwise rotation is applied simultaneously with continued northward translation (i.e., the second stage). This setup creates a combination of constant translation and rotation of the moving basal plastic sheet (Fig. 2c).\nSimilar to the previously described ones (Fig. 5), the best-fit model transfers strike-slip and transtension in the west into thrusting in the south via a transpressional region at the SW corner of the indenter (Fig. 8). The viscous layer distributes deformation over a larger area when compared to the reference model, with a similar geometry to the one of the Cerna-Timok faults system (compare Figs. 1c and 8).\nThe initial translation stage (Fig. 8a and b) forms NNE-SSW oriented en-echelon Riedel shears oblique to the basal VD in the north (R in Fig. 8a) and two main strike-slip faults along the western margin (structures 1 and 2 in Fig. 8a and b), similar to other models (Fig. 5). These strike-slip faults simulate an original onset of the Timok and Cerna as separate faults, which were linked to the main southern thrusting area via the curved SW indenter's corner, in a similar way to the transfer to an initial Cerna-Timok dextral offset to the Balkanides (compare with thrusting in Fig. 1c). This geometry also implies that the present-day truncation of the Cerna by the Timok Fault is a later, early Miocene feature, by a splay connecting the southern Cerna with the northern Timok. The southern area shows distributed low offset back-thrusts (Fig. 8a), while north dipping normal faults accommodate the collapse of the gravitationally unstable thrust wedge in the hinterland of the main thrust front (blue in Fig. 8b).\n\n5.1\nTranstensional basin geometry and structure\nThe transfer of deformation around the NW indenter corner from strike-slip\/transtension (green and light blue values in Fig. 8b) along the western margin into transtensional (light blue and pale blue values in Fig. 8b) deformation in the north of the indenter takes place already during the initial translation stage (Fig. 8a and b). Such a transfer mechanism has already been inferred for the general splaying of strike-slip system towards the South Carpathians, around the rigid indenter's NW corner, where the slip changes from strike-slip into oblique normal-slip and even normal-slip deformation, resulting in the early Miocene transtensional opening of the Getic Depression (Fig. 1c, Matenco et al., 2003; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013).\nThe subsequent rotation in the best-fit model has comparable scaled dimensions and is controlled by 10\u00b0 of total clockwise rotation along the western margin of the indenter (Fig. 8c), an amount that was reported for the Serbian Carpathians for Oligocene \u2013 Miocene times (Marovi\u0107 et al., 2002). In the same area, the model shows the formation of transtensional basins along the western margin of the indenter that are very similar with the ones observed in the natural case (Fig. 1c). The similarity also insinuates that the subsurface SW and NW corner geometry of Moesian indenter had a similar curvature with the one presently observed. In models with rectangular indenters and 10\u00b0 CW rotation, basins are much larger than the ones observed in the Serbian and South Carpathians (compare Figs. 1c, 5 and 7). The subsequent rotation in the best-fit model complicates the structural pattern by distributing deformation over additional structures. For instance, new faults (e.g., 3 and 4 in Fig. 8c) form in the area between previously formed structures (1 and 2, Fig. 8c and d), similarily to other models with rotation (Fig. 5). Furthermore, rotation increases oblique movements along all structures (intercalating light blue and yellow \u2013 orange colours in Fig. 8d).\nIn more details, the transtensional basin at the western margin of the indenter displays a more complex geometry than the one in the reference model because of the combined influence of the rotation and viscous layer at the bottom. In M6 it consists of two interconnected basins (Fig. 8c) which gradually enlarge and connect in later stages of deformation. The larger basin (Figs. 7b and 8c) is elongated in roughly N\u2013S direction and is opened along the western margin of the rigid block. The smaller one is located to the north with a curvature controlled by the NW corner of the indenter.\nThe geometry of the larger basin is controlled by the position with respect to the pole of rotation (fixed pin in Fig. 2a, c). Initially, a triangular transtensional basin opens due to the oblique normal slip along Riedel shears (similar to M4, M5, M7-10 in Fig. 5), which gradually widens southwards with subsequent deformation and rotation (i.e., in the direction away from the pole of rotation). Transtensional (dextral-normal) faults control the subsidence and bound the basin to the west and east (structures 2 and 3 in Fig. 8c). Structure 2 accommodates a larger amount of deformation (Fig. 8e, cross-sections a-a\u2019, b-b\u2019). Its associated sedimentary infill is affected by subsequent dextral strike-slip faulting (structure 4) that cuts through the basin and transfers most offset from structure 2 (Fig. 8c). These modelling geometries are fairly similar with the triangular geometry and differential subsidence observed in the Timok - Knja\u017eevac basins system (Fig. 1c, Marovi\u0107 et al., 2007).\nThe smaller basin opens along the northern margin and NW curved corner of the indenter. In this area, the transtensional dextral slip is transferred into dominantly NNW- to N-dipping normal faults (structure 5 in Fig. 8c and d and cross-section a-a' in Fig. 8e) that control sedimentation in the basin. The offsets along these faults are significantly smaller than along faults controlling the N\u2013S oriented basin and, therefore, the curved basin in the north is shallower (e.g., cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 8e). These transtensional faults form towards the end of the experiment and have eastward decreasing offsets (structure 5 in Fig. 8c and d). These patterns are in agreement with observations in the Getic Depression (Fig. 1c), where the Timok Fault splays in multiple branches with gradually decreasing offset (e.g., R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011 and references therein). However, the basin that opens along the NW corner and northern margin of the rigid block in the best-fit model is much shallower compared to up to 3\u00a0km subsidence generated in the Getic Depression (Matenco et al., 2003). This observation indicates that dragging along the Cerna-Timok faults system may be responsible for the ultimate connection between the Timok basin and the Getic Depression but is not the main mechanism controlling the subsidence in the latter. This is in agreement with the interpretation of the transtensional Getic Depression opening mechanism (e.g., Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013; Ma\u0163enco, 2017) in response to the Carpathians slab pull (presently remaining only as the Vrancea slab, Fig. 1a) and its associated tearing along an E-W oriented Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator (STEP) system in the South Carpathians (Fig. 1a; Govers and Wortel, 2005; Ma\u0163enco, 2017). Our modelling does not account for such more advanced geodynamic effects.\n\n\n5.2\nTransition between strike-slip\/transtension and thrusting\nSouth of the N\u2013S oriented basin along the western indenter's margin, the strike-slip deformation is distributed over numerous vertical to high-angle faults (Fig. 8c, e, cross-section c-c\u2019). These faults have a normal slip component that decreases southwards and is replaced with oblique reverse slip as the deformation is gradually transferred around the SW corner of the indenter (Fig. 8c and d) and further to thrusting south of the indenter (Fig. 8c and d, cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 8e). The thrusting in the south and associated normal faulting due to the gravitational instability of the built-up wedge (Fig. 8c and d) are similar as in the reference model. The only difference is that back-thrusts and normal faults have smaller offsets in the best-fit model (Fig. 8c and d, cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 8e). An interesting feature is that the area of gravitational collapse during translation (blue in Fig. 8b) gets shortened during the subsequent rotation (red and orange area in the hanging wall of the basal thrust in Fig. 8d; see also Supplementary Appendix F). Both, thrusts and normal faults have a curved map-view geometry because they are linked with the strike-slip corridor in the west (Fig. 8c).\nThe transfer of strike-slip deformation into thrusting simulates very well and is compatible with the transfer of deformation observed from the Cerna-Timok fault system into the western Balkanides thrust wedge (e.g, Schmid et al., 2020). The thrusts in the Balkanides also have a curved geometry due to the dextral drag along the Timok Fault during the transfer of deformation (Fig. 1b and c, see Schmid et al., 2020). Minor back-thrusting is also observed in the Balkanides nappes north of the Sofia basin (Fig. 1c).\nThe offset along the strike-slip system at the western margin of the rigid block decreases southwards in the best-fit model (from ~6\u00a0cm to <2\u00a0cm, see the offset of black and yellow marker lines in top view of Fig. 8c). Notably, the southern propagation of the strike-slip faults offset earlier shortening structures (structure 6 in Fig. 8c, e, cross-section c-c\u2019). Such propagation of strike-slip faults and truncation of older structures in the south are common features in other models as well (e.g., fault 6 in M2, 6 and 7 in M3, 6 in M4, southern prolongation of 4 and 5 in M5, 5 in M7, 6 in M8, 6 and 7 in M9, 3 in M10, southern prolongation of 4 in M11 and M12, Fig. 5). The decrease in offset in models explains well the observed significant decrease in Timok fault dextral offset from 65\u00a0km in the north to around 5\u201310\u00a0km south of Pirot basin (Fig. 1c). A large part of the Timok dextral offset is taken up by thrusting in the Balkanides (Schmid et al., 2020), while the remainder in the southward prolongation is less constrained. One interpretation assumes that the Timok Fault is an inherited feature that was connected with the Cretaceous strike-slip deformation in the northern Rhodope (Fig. 1a and b, dashed line in Fig. 1c, the connection with the NW-SE oriented Maritsa Fault of Schmid et al., 2020, see also Naydenov et al., 2009, 2013; Henry et al., 2012; Vangelov et al., 2016). Another interpretation suggests that the Timok Fault continues south of the Pirot basin, offsetting the Kusa Vrana anticline (Fig. 1c, Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2003; Vangelov et al., 2016; van Hinsbergen et al., 2020). By comparing the geometries and overall evolution (Figs. 1c, 5 and 8), including the observed geometry of strike-slip deformation, our models are more compatible with the second solution.\n\n\n\n6\nDeformation transfer and oroclinal bending around indenters\nIn this section we will discuss and compare our modelling results, summarized in Fig. 9\n, with previous studies.\n\n6.1\nEffects of the rigid indenter geometry on the strain partitioning\nOur results show that deformation around a rigid indenter with either round or angular corners leads to curved fault systems where thrusting in the shortening domain transitions to strike-slip deformation through a system of oblique slip faults (Fig. 9). This transitional area coincides with the maximum curvature of the fault system. This curvature is gradual in cases of rounded indenter corners, but abrupt in cases of rectangular comers, indicating that stress concentrations at indenter dips control the locus and geometry of deformation. Similar effects have been shown by Luth et al. (2013), where new faults nucleate at indenter dips. Overall, our results are in line with previous analogue modelling studies where the curvature of fold and thrust belts in front of an indenter are controlled by the indenter geometry (Marshak, 1988; Marshak et al., 1992; Zweigel et al., 1998; Costa and Speranza, 2003; Crespo-Blanc and Gonz\u00e1lez-S\u00e1nchez, 2005; Luth et al., 2013; Jim\u00e9nez-Bonilla et al., 2020). Similar to our results, these studies exhibit a narrowing of the deformed area when deformation is transferred from the frontal to the lateral indenter margin (e.g., Marshak, 1988; Crespo-Blanc and Gonz\u00e1lez-S\u00e1nchez, 2005; Luth et al., 2013). The change in deformation regime around the indenter is also associated with a decrease in topography from the contractional to the strike-slip domain, which is gradual in case of a rounded indenter (Fig. 9a) because northward translational component of displacement continuously transfers deformation to the strike-slip domain. This material transfer results in a higher topography farther northward and limits the formation of a wide and deep basin. In contrast, when the corner is rectangular (Fig. 9b), the wedge topography rapidly decreases northwards along a series of normal faults leading to a narrow transition zone (Fig. 9b).\nThe structure of the thrust wedge that forms south of the indenter is largely independent of the indenter geometry. The top to north basal thrust has a flat-ramp-flat geometry and the south-verging back-thrust system accommodates deformation in the hanging wall during thrusting (Fig. 5, see also cross-sections e-e\u2019 in Fig. 3g and d-d' in Fig. 4e). N-dipping normal faults, which reactivate previously formed back-thrusts, are interpreted as an expression of gravitational instability on top of the upper flat segment (Fig. 3g, cross-section e-e\u2019, Fig. 4e, cross-section d-d' and Fig. 8e, cross-section d-d\u2019; see also Supplementary Appendix C, F). These key features are consistent with previous modelling studies (Bonini et al., 2000; Rosas et al., 2017 and references therein; Fedorik et al., 2019).\n\n\n6.2\nRotational control on the coupled basin-orogen evolution\nIn our models, morphologic depressions with limited lateral extent evolve along the strike-slip shear zone (Fig. 5) and probably reflect early dilatancy during shear zone development. All major sedimentary basins open in response to rotation of the mobile plate (Fig. 9c). During rotation the tangential extension (i.e., pole of rotation coincides with the pole of extensional opening) will create basins with a triangular map-view geometry (Fig. 9c), which is narrowing towards the pole of rotation, as observed in many natural examples including the Aegean (eg. Brun et al., 2016) or the southern Ethiopean segment of the East African rift system (Philippon et al., 2014), and modelling studies (Zwaan et al., 2020 and references therein).\nAlthough basins in our models are triangular and overall become narrower northwards (Figs. 5 and 7b), the combination of rotation and translation creates significant dextral shearing within the basin and partitions deformation between normal, oblique-normal and strike-slip faults as also described by Farangitakis et al. (2019; 2021). This is different to rotational extensional settings without coeval translation, where the size of the basin and its propagation towards the pole of rotation is solely controlled by the amount of rotation (Zwaan et al., 2020). The dextral component of shearing inside the basin creates major high angle faults, which are similar to the previous results of transtensional strike-slip experiments invoking a curved velocity discontinuity at the base of the model (Smit et al., 2010).\nShearing along the oblique-slip dextral faults transfers northern parts of the basin beyond of the pole of rotation (Fig. 7b), which would otherwise be an area of transpression (see Zwaan et al., 2020). This effect is enhanced when invoking a ductile crust (see section 6.3). We furthermore note that the geometry of rotational triangular basins can also be controlled by inherited structural patterns or rheological heterogeneities (e.g., Molnar et al., 2017; 2019; Zwaan and Schreurs, 2020). However, as these aspects are not the focus of this study, they will not be discussed further.\n\n\n6.3\nInfluence of the viscous layer on structural patterns\nThe presence of a viscous layer distributes deformation over larger areas with a lower number of high offset structures (Figs. 5\u20137, 9d). The reduced number of faults in these models and a more gradual transition of deformation along the indenter's margins results in a less well-developed structural pattern. These features have also been observed in previous studies (e.g., Casas et al., 2001; Leever et al., 2011; Luth et al., 2013; Jim\u00e9nez-Bonilla et al., 2020 and references therein).\nA novel aspect of our study is related to the transfer of deformation around the north-western indenter corners, where we interpret the development of splay faults in the brittle layer as an expression of flow in the underlying viscous layer that also affects areas on the adjacent fixed sheet (see Figs. 2c, 7 and 9c). We suggest that this flow generates a transtensional deformation regime leading to minor thinning of the viscous layer and subsidence within a local basin. The geometry of the(sub-)basin is controlled by the geometry of the NW corner (curved basin vs. more angular basin connection, Fig. 7b). South of the indenter, where the viscous layer is involved in thrusting over the ramp, most of the shortening is accommodated by the main basal thrust with well distributed hanging wall shortening (e.g., Fig. 8e, cross-section d-d\u2019), which is also observed in models by Bonini et al. (2000).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe present a series of crustal scale analogue experiments studying strain partitioning around an overall rectangular, rigid indenter with inclined margins. The investigated parameters include the shape of the indenter corners, the kinematic boundary conditions and the rheological stratification of the model crust.\nOur models show that the shape of the indenter corners (rounded versus rectangular) has a major control on the style and geometry of deformation in the vicinity of the indenter. Styles of deformation include thrusts striking parallel to the indenter margin in the contractional domain, strike-slip fault systems parallel to the overall transport direction and oblique slip fault systems accommodating the deformation transfer from the contractional to the strike-slip domain. Together these structures define an orocline whose curvature, width of deformed area and along strike topographic gradient are largely controlled by the indenter corners. Models with rounded corners result in a gradual transition from thrusting to strike-slip deformation affecting a relatively wide area. This transition is abrupt in the case of rectangular indenter corners and deformation is concentrated in the strike -slip domain within a narrow zone close to the indenter-model interface. These differences are the consequence of stress concentrations at indenter tips.\nThe modelling results furthermore demonstrate that 10o clockwise rotation of the model layers relative to the stationary indenter is critical for opening of syn-tectonic sedimentary basins with triangular geometry along indenter margin(s). Overall, this area is characterized by transtensional strain where new, steeply dipping strike slip faults with normal component of shear form in the centre of the basin accommodating its rotational opening. Implementation of a viscous layer leads to distribution deformation over a wider area, which is, however, accommodated by fewer large-offset structures. Most importantly, flow of the viscous layer around indenter corner allows for transfer of deformation from the mobile to the stationary plate and the formation of curved transtensional basins.\nBased on these models, we propose that oroclinal bending of the Carpatho-Balkanides is not only accommodated by the Cerna and Timok strike-slip faults, but involves the transfer of strain from the Balkanides where simultaneous contraction lead to the formation of a fold and thrust belt. Deformation is partitioned along numerous structures that control the northward translation and coeval opening of the transtensional basins (such as Timok and Knja\u017eevac basins) along the Timok Fault, while the dextral splay faults around the NW Moesian corner, link up with deformation in the Getic Depression. Furthermore, we suggest that the southward decrease in dextral offset along the Timok Fault is a result of deformation transfer into thrusting in front of Moesia, which gradually reduces the amount of strike-slip deformation southwards along this fault.\nIn general, our modelling results show that oroclinal bending around rigid indenters is inevitably associated with the partitioning of deformation involving the coeval displacement of linked thrust, oblique-slip and strike slip fault systems to accommodate translational and rotational plate movements.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nNemanja Krstekani\u0107: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization.

Consequently, total strain, deformation intensity, and the scale of resulting structures increase from distal foreland positions towards the internal zones of mountain belts. Extensive research over many decades has documented mesoscale deformation structures \u2013 on the scale of mm to tens of m \u2013 that are consistent with deformation in a thrust faulting stress regime, including joints, veins, faults, slickolites, stylolites, pencil cleavage, cleavage, and compaction bands (e.g., Engelder and Geiser, 1979; Geiser and Engelder, 1983; Hancock, 1985; Ferrill, 1989; Dunne and Hancock, 1994). However, these same rocks typically record other widespread deformation features such as normal faults, transport-parallel vertical opening mode fractures (joints and veins), and strike-slip faults, that appear inconsistent with development in a thrust faulting stress regime (e.g., Stearns, 1968; Jamison, 2016). This spectrum of deformation features observed in fold-thrust belts and their forelands reflects deformation under local to sub-regional normal and strike-slip stress conditions, as well as deformation in a thrust-faulting regime. Tavani et al. (2015) refer to the common evidence for strike-slip regime deformation in fold-thrust belts as \u201cthe \u03c32 paradox\u201d, based on the apparently ambiguous orientation of the intermediate principal stress direction.\nIn this paper, we present a unifying conceptual model consisting of a five-stage stress regime sequence that applies to subhorizontal sedimentary strata near the frontal limits of fold-thrust belts, as well as more complexly deformed strata within the fold-thrust belt where local fold- and fault-related structural position may have superimposed additional deformation. This conceptual model incorporates evolving stress regimes, and accounts for apparently inconsistent structures by the natural progression between normal, strike-slip, and thrust-faulting stress and deformation regimes. Field examples are used to illustrate common mesostructures, as well as to provide examples showing relative timing in the deformation and stress field evolution. This conceptual model can be used both to understand observed deformation features, and to predict likely deformation assemblages in subsurface environments.\n\n\n2\nFailure modes, orientations, and stress significance\nRock failure is represented by deformation processes that are directly related to the effective stresses and rock mechanical properties at the time of failure (Donath, 1970). Failure envelopes in shear stress (\u03c4) versus normal stress (\u03c3n) space represent stress conditions at the time of failure and can be used to depict stress-dependent failure behavior of different rock types (Fig. 1\n). Across the spectrum of stress conditions and mechanical properties (from sediment to lithified rock) at the time of failure, brittle failure surfaces form at a wide range of angles (\u03b8) between the maximum principal compressive stress direction and the failure plane (following usage of Hancock, 1985). Failure modes include tensile, hybrid, shear, compactive shear, and compactive failure (Aydin et al., 2006; Ferrill et al., 2017b), which accommodate a progression from volume gain (tensile, hybrid), through volume neutral (shear) to volume loss (compactive shear and simple compaction) processes (Ferrill et al., 2020b, 2020c).\nTensile failure surfaces form perpendicular to the minimum principal compressive stress (\u03c33) and parallel to the maximum (\u03c31) and intermediate (\u03c32) principal compressive stresses (i.e., \u03b8\u00a0\u2248\u00a00\u00b0), with no appreciable shear, and extension perpendicular to the fracture plane (Fig. 1; Fig. 2\na and b). Hybrid failure represents the transition between tensile and shear failure (Hancock, 1985; Ramsey and Chester, 2004; Ferrill et al., 2020b). Hybrid failure surfaces form at \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a03\u201313\u00b0 (Ramsey and Chester, 2004; Bobich, 2005; Ferrill et al., 2012) and tend to be non-planar composite surfaces made up of irregular patchworks of both tensile and shear patches (Ramsey and Chester, 2004; Bobich, 2005; Ferrill et al., 2014; Hoek and Martin, 2014, Fig. 2c), but may also include near planar, obliquely opening veins (Price and Cosgrove, 1990; Belayneh and Cosgrove, 2010; Meng et al., 2018). Shear failure occurs on planes at acute angles to \u03c31, obtuse angles to \u03c33, and parallel to \u03c32. Shear failure angle \u03b8 is commonly assumed to be 30\u00b0, but may range from 10\u00b0 to ~45\u00b0 depending on rock competence (Mandl, 1988, Fig. 2d). Compactive-shear failure occurs on planes at \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a045\u201385\u00b0, with components of both shear and compaction (Fig. 1; Fig. 2e) and results in volume loss at failure surfaces (c.f., shear-enhanced compaction bands; Eichhubl et al., 2010; Charalampidou et al., 2014). Compactive failure surfaces form approximately perpendicular (\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a085\u201390\u00b0) to \u03c31, and parallel to \u03c32 and \u03c33, with compaction (volume loss) approximately perpendicular to the failure surface (Fig. 2f).\nIn a typical mechanically layered system, neighboring beds often exhibit different responses to applied stress, reflecting different mechanical properties and\/or local stress conditions (e.g., Alvarez et al., 1978; Ferrill and Dunne, 1989; Lorenz et al., 2002). These bed-to-bed differences, along with deformation by different mechanisms within single beds in response to a single stress regime, can lead to multiple diverse failure modes (e.g., Fig. 3\n) and dramatic differences in failure modes and associated mesostructures because of differences in rock competence (Donath, 1970). Less competent beds (e.g., clay-rich shale) can deform through ductile mechanisms rather than building stress magnitudes to the point of brittle failure, while more competent beds (e.g., well-cemented quartz sandstone, clay-poor limestone, chert) tend to build stress and experience brittle failure. Different failure envelopes for different rock types with variable mechanical properties, varying structural positions, and different effective stress conditions through a stratigraphic sequence will result in local variations in mesostructural suites produced through the fold-thrust belt stress cycle (Alvarez et al., 1978; Ferrill and Dunne, 1989; Cawood and Bond, 2018).\n\n\n3\nStress and deformation regime evolution\nStress regimes in the Earth's crust are commonly described in terms of which principal stress is approximated by the vertical (\u03c3V) overburden stress. The stress regime terminology references normal faulting, strike-slip faulting, and thrust faulting, and is used regardless of whether or not stress magnitudes are appropriate for faulting to occur (Anderson, 1951). Overburden stress is controlled by the depth (h), density of the overlying rock (\u03c1), and acceleration due to gravity (g), and calculated as \u03c1gh. Normal faulting regime is defined by vertical \u03c31. Strike-slip faulting regime is defined by vertical \u03c32. Thrust (or reverse) faulting regime is defined by vertical \u03c33. Sedimentary layers may experience multiple stress regimes from the time of their deposition and burial through to present-day conditions. In the following sections, we discuss stress evolution in reference to vertical overburden stress (\u03c3V), the horizontal stress in the thrust belt transport direction (\u03c3T), and horizontal stress in the direction perpendicular to the thrust belt transport direction (\u03c3P).\n\n3.1\nStage 1 \u2013 burial\nOur conceptual model of progressive stress field development in a fold-thrust belt (Fig. 4\n) starts with Stage 1 \u201cburial\u201d and compaction-driven deformation in a normal faulting regime. Through Stage 1, \u03c31 is vertical, defined by the overburden stress. This stage commonly begins with uniform horizontal principal stresses (i.e., no horizontal stress anisotropy), although non-uniform horizontal stress can occur, for example in the case of deposition on a slope. In the absence of a regional influence, horizontal stress is controlled by horizontal confinement and the tendency for a material to expand in directions perpendicular to the direction of compression, known as the \u201cPoisson effect\u201d (Engelder, 1985). In foreland settings two very different regional influences may develop to establish distinct maximum and minimum horizontal stress conditions. In some foreland settings, thrust belt loading and bending of a downgoing subducted slab can cause development of a flexural forebulge and an associated indirect influence on stress anisotropy. Bending associated with this forebulge can produce horizontal stress anisotropy, within the context of the ambient normal faulting regime, characterized by minimum horizontal stress in the \u03c3T direction (Stage 1A in Fig. 4; Lash and Engelder, 2007; Tavani et al., 2015). In contrast, the direct thrust belt influence that orients distinct maximum and minimum horizontal stress is the influence of the initial tectonic horizontal compression in the \u03c3T direction. This initial horizontal compression produces a consistent horizontal stress anisotropy (i.e., \u03c3T\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c3P) but through this stage a normal faulting stress regime persists (Stage 1B in Fig. 4). With continued horizontal compression associated with advance of the thrust front, the horizontal stress anisotropy responds to increasing stress in the \u03c3T direction.\n\n\n3.2\nStage 2 \u2013 early compression\nStage 2 \u201cearly compression\u201d begins when \u03c3T reaches the overburden stress (\u03c31\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3V\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3T). Increase in the maximum horizontal stress past the magnitude of the overburden stress leads to a strike-slip stress regime (Fig. 4), with vertical \u03c32 controlled by overburden stress (\u03c31\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3T\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3V\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c33\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3P). As \u03c3T continues to increase, \u03c3P also increases because of the Poisson effect. Meanwhile, \u03c3V continues to be governed by the overburden stress.\n\n\n3.3\nStage 3 \u2013 thrust belt compression\nStage 3 \u201cthrust belt compression\u201d begins when the growing minimum horizontal stress in the \u03c3P direction (increasing due to Poisson effect) exceeds the overburden stress. At this point the stress regime transitions to a thrust-faulting stress regime (\u03c31\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3T\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3P\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c33\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3V) as the maximum horizontal stress in the \u03c3T direction increases (Fig. 4). Deformation features may develop through this stage in subhorizontal strata, but larger scale folding and thrust faulting commonly occurs, and reorients earlier formed structures due to layer rotation, as well as producing local variations in deformation controlled by structure and mechanical stratigraphic position (e.g., Tavani et al., 2015). Eventual waning \u03c3T causes declining maximum horizontal stress and produces a companion decline in the minimum horizontal stress due to the Poisson effect.\n\n\n3.4\nStage 4 \u2013 late compression and initial relaxation\nStage 4 \u201clate compression and initial relaxation\u201d begins with the return to strike-slip stress conditions (\u03c31\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3T\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3V\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c33\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3P) as the minimum horizontal stress falls below the overburden stress magnitude (Fig. 4). Continued waning \u03c3T causes declining maximum horizontal stress and produces a companion decline in the minimum horizontal stress due to the Poisson effect.\n\n\n3.5\nStage 5 \u2013 extensional relaxation and orogenic collapse\nContinued relaxation in the regional compression direction causes the stress in the \u03c3T direction to decrease until it equals and then falls below the overburden stress \u03c3V, and with this the return to a normal faulting stress regime and onset of Stage 5A \u201cextensional relaxation and orogenic collapse\u201d (\u03c31\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3V\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3T\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c33\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3P). Continued relaxation in the \u03c3T direction may drop \u03c3T below \u03c3P (\u03c31\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3V\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3P\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c33\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3T), and with this transition, the \u03c33 direction switches by 90\u00b0 (Stage 5B).\n\n\n\n4\nProgressive deformation\nProgressive deformation may generate a diverse spectrum of mesostructures superposed through the five-stage sequence (Figs. 4 and 5\n). The actual mesostructures developed depend on a range of local controls, in particular the rock types present and their degree of lithification, mechanical properties, specific stress conditions, and fluid pressure conditions. We explore the expected progressive deformation sequence for three main categories of mesostructures: (i) opening mode fractures \u2013 tensile failure, (ii) faults \u2013 including hybrid, shear, and compactive shear deformation, and (iii) compactive failure surfaces.\n\n4.1\nOpening mode fractures (tensile failure)\nOpening mode fractures include joints and veins that initiate with opening perpendicular to fracture walls. In Stage 1, vertical opening mode fractures could potentially form with no regional preferred strike alignment under conditions of no horizontal stress anisotropy, driven by compaction and fluid overpressure. If forebulge flexure develops during Stage 1 (i.e., Stage 1A in Figs. 4 and 5), early extension in the \u03c3T direction may produce opening mode fractures that strike parallel to the \u03c3P direction (Lash and Engelder, 2007; Tavani et al., 2015, 2019, 2020). With onset of initial regional compression, horizontal stress anisotropy leads to consistent alignment of vertical opening mode fractures that strike parallel to the regional compression direction \u03c3T (Stage 1B in Fig. 5). Early formed veins may be folded during continued burial-related compaction (see Fig. 6\n; Gale et al., 2014; Hooker et al., 2019). With onset of Stage 2 and strike-slip stress regime conditions, regional compression-parallel vertical opening mode fractures continue to form and intensify (e.g., Fig. 7\n; Nickelsen and Hough, 1967; Engelder and Geiser, 1980; Engelder, 1985; Lorenz and Finley, 1991; Lorenz et al., 1991; Tavani et al., 2020). With the transition to Stage 3 and thrust-faulting stress regime conditions, vertical opening mode fracturing is replaced by horizontal opening mode fracturing. These bed-parallel fractures often host veins, cemented by a variety of minerals with blocky, prismatic, or fibrous cement, with fibrous bed-parallel veins commonly referred to as \u2018beef\u2019 (e.g., Fig. 8\na and b; Henderson et al., 1990; Cobbold et al., 2013; Gale et al., 2014; Ukar et al., 2017). Stage 4 marks the return to strike-slip stress regime conditions, and again produces vertical opening mode fractures parallel to the regional compression direction (Zhao and Jacobi, 1997; Tavani et al., 2020). During this stage, previously formed bed-parallel veins \u2013 which may remain horizontal or have been tilted or folded during Stage 3 \u2013 are likely to be cut by bed-perpendicular veins (e.g., Fig. 8c). Stage 5 marks the return to a normal faulting regime \u2013 opening-mode fractures formed in Stage 5A are likely to parallel \u03c3T, similar to those formed in Stage 1B. Opening-mode fractures formed in Stage 5B after continued relaxation or \u201cover-relaxation\u201d in the \u03c3T direction may produce orthogonal opening-mode fractures perpendicular to the \u03c3T direction and parallel to the \u03c3P direction (Engelder, 1985; Dunne and North, 1990; Lorenz and Finley, 1991; McGinnis et al., 2017). This over-relaxation occurs after cessation of thrust belt compression, and can be driven by slab rollback or slab removal (e.g., Basin and Range province of the western U.S.; see Yonkee and Weil, 2015, and references therein) or rifting (Atlantic rifting along the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern U.S.; see Withjack et al., 2020, and references therein). Subhorizontal strata that have experienced the full five-stage deformation sequence may contain three mutually perpendicular fracture sets \u2013 two bed-perpendicular sets that are vertical and parallel and perpendicular to the regional compression direction, and one bed-parallel set of horizontal fractures that accommodated vertical extension.\n\n\n4.2\nFaults (hybrid, shear, and compactive shear failure)\nDeformation features that involve components of shear include hybrid, shear, and compactive shear failure surfaces, and may collectively be referred to as faults. The three different failure modes have distinct implications for stress conditions at the time of failure, and for the orientation of failure surfaces. Unlike tensile and compactive failure surfaces that form perpendicular to \u03c33 or \u03c31 respectively, hybrid, shear, and compactive shear failure occur on planes oblique to \u03c31 and \u03c33, either as individual failure surfaces or as two conjugate planes. Consequently, each stress regime change leads to switching in fault orientations and associated slip directions. Stage 1 normal faulting during initial burial may form polygonal fault arrays with no preferred orientation in a tectonically relaxed basin (Laurent et al., 2012; Maher, 2014; Bracken, 2020). Flexural bending in a forebulge may occur in some locations and produce horizontal stress anisotropy, and normal faults striking in the \u03c3P direction (Stage 1A in Fig. 5; Tavani et al., 2015; Budach et al., 2018; Shipilin et al., 2020). With the onset of regional compression in late Stage 1, normal faults with consistent strikes parallel to compression in the \u03c3T direction are likely to develop during Stage 1B (Fig. 3; e.g., Fig.\u00a018 in Morley et al., 2014; also see Groshong et al., 2009; Ferrill et al., 2014, 2017a, 2020a). During Stage 2, strike-slip faults (e.g., Fig. 9\n) are likely to form in conjugate arrays with the acute bisector paralleling \u03c3T (Marshak et al., 1982; Lorenz et al., 2002). Stage 3 represents a switch to thrust faulting (e.g., Fig. 10\n), with development of conjugate or imbricate thrust faults (Alvarez et al., 1978; Wilkins et al., 2014; Ferrill et al., 2016). Stage 4 faults are again expected to be vertical conjugate strike-slip faults oblique to \u03c31 and \u03c33 (Marshak et al., 1982; Groshong et al., 2009; Giorgetti et al., 2016; Carlini et al., 2019). In early Stage 5, normal faults may form with strikes perpendicular to extension in the \u03c3P direction (i.e., parallel to Stage 1B normal faults), then later in Stage 5 form perpendicular to extension in the \u03c3T direction (i.e., perpendicular to late Stage-1 normal faults, and parallel to Stage 1A normal faults), accommodating orogenic collapse (Ghisetti and Vezzani, 1999; Thompson, 2015; Yonkee and Weil, 2015; Favorito and Seedorff, 2017, 2020).\n\n\n4.3\nCompactive failure\nCompactive failure surfaces form perpendicular to \u03c31, and may be represented by stylolites or cleavage (Alvarez et al., 1978; Engelder and Geiser, 1979; Engelder and Marshak, 1985; Mitra and Yonkee, 1985; Ferrill, 1989; Ferrill and Dunne, 1989; Protzman and Mitra, 1990; Gray and Mitra, 1993), and compaction bands (Aydin et al., 2006). During Stage 1, compactive failure is likely to manifest as bed-parallel stylolites or compaction bands (Fig. 3). In Stage 2, vertical, bed-perpendicular stylolites, cleavage, and compaction bands form perpendicular to \u03c3T (e.g., Fig. 11\n). With continued increase in horizontal compression and the transition into thrust faulting stress regime of Stage 3, there is no change in \u03c31 direction, so tectonic stylolites, cleavage, and compaction bands may continue to develop. With diminishing regional compression in Stage 4, there continues to be no change in the \u03c31 direction or orientation of compactive failure. Note that the same networks or fabrics of compactive deformation features may develop continuously through Stages 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 11). As normal faulting stress conditions return in Stage 5, vertical compactive failure surfaces that experienced protracted deformation become deactivated, and horizontal compactive failure surfaces can again develop (Ghisetti and Vezzani, 1999).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nActivation, deactivation, and reactivation\nBased on the conceptual model for mesostructural development through the initiation, development, and eventual collapse of a foreland fold-thrust belt, predictions can be made about the potential activation, deactivation, and reactivation of mesostructures. There are three specific cases where deformation features may continue to be active from one stage to the next \u2013 otherwise deformation features should be expected to deactivate from one deformation stage to the next. In the first case, regional-compression-parallel vertical opening-mode fractures developed in Stage 1B will remain active or continue to grow through Stage 2. Second, similarly oriented regional-compression-parallel vertical opening-mode fractures developed in Stage 4 strike-slip regime stress conditions may continue to remain active into Stage 5A normal faulting regime conditions. These fractures tend to be ubiquitous structures in thrust belts and their forelands. In the third case, compactive failure features initiated in Stage 2, perpendicular to \u03c3T, are likely to continue to be active through Stage 3 and Stage 4, because of the stability in the \u03c31 direction. Compactive failure features include tectonic stylolites, pencil cleavage, planar cleavage, and slaty cleavage. These structures, especially planar cleavage and slaty cleavage, locally represent the most intensely developed mesostructures in fold-thrust belts (e.g., Fig. 11; Marshak and Engelder, 1985; Mitra and Yonkee, 1985). Other than these cases, stress changes from one stage to the next should deactivate all deformation features that were active during the previous stage.\nReactivation of deformation features implies a period of inactivity for these structures from one deformation stage to the next. Reactivation includes two general cases \u2013 either reactivation in the same mode as the original deformation mode, or reactivation in a different mode from the original deformation mode. Candidates for same-mode reactivation include all deformation features developed in Stage 2 because each of these are appropriately oriented to be reactivated under the same failure modes during Stage 4 (Figs. 4 and 5). The other potential cases of same-mode reactivation are associated with structures developed in Stage 1A normal-faulting regime that may be reactivated in Stage 5B, and structures developed in Stage 1B normal-faulting regime that may be reactivated in Stage 5A (Fig. 5).\nDifferent-mode reactivation is likely in two particular cases. In the first case, bedding-parallel compaction fabrics (compaction bands or stylolites) developed in Stage 1 are ideally oriented to be reactivated as horizontal (opening mode) failure surfaces during Stage 3. In the second case, vertical tectonic stylolites and cleavage developed through Stages 2, 3, and 4, are ideally oriented to be reactivated as opening mode fractures during Stage 5B (e.g., Figs. 11 and 12\n). In both of these cases, the potential for reactivation is accentuated by concentration of clay on compactive failure surfaces where pressure solution occurred (Alvarez et al., 1978; Engelder and Marshak, 1985), as these clay selvages tend to be weaker than the host rock in general.\nIn addition to the cases discussed above, where earlier-formed structures are ideally oriented for later same-mode or different-mode reactivation, reactivation may also occur due to rotation of structures with respect to the stress field (e.g., by tilting or folding), or reactivation of non-ideally oriented but mechanically weak structures (e.g., Wilkins et al., 2001).\n\n\n5.2\nTectonic position and deformation stages\nChanges in mesostructural suites from internal parts of fold-thrust belts to distal foreland settings does not simply correspond to a stress or deformation intensity gradient but to systematic changes in stress orientations. Different domains of a fold-thrust belt and foreland system at any particular time period may be experiencing different stages in the deformation sequence \u2013 the internal part of a fold-thrust belt may be undergoing Stage 3\u00a0at the same time as the distal foreland is experiencing Stage 1. The most distal regions in the foreland of a fold thrust belt may only experience normal faulting regime deformation (i.e., Stage 1) with no influence of horizontal stress anisotropy. Slightly more proximal areas may only experience normal faulting regime deformation, but with some horizontal stress anisotropy associated with Stages 1 and 5 deformation. Intermediate distance foreland areas may never experience thrust-faulting stress regime conditions of Stage 3, and only experience Stages 1, 2, 4, and 5 deformation. Oscillations in local stress regimes may occur in foreland positions, with joints and veins formed both parallel and perpendicular to \u03c3T (Dunne and North, 1990). Foreland areas proximal to fold-thrust belts are likely to experience the full five-stage deformation sequence.\nStudies of calcite twin strain and stress in limestone as a function of position in the foreland of fold-thrust belts has shown that thrust belt compression and related crystal-plastic deformation commonly observed within thrust belts can extend 800\u00a0km or more into the foreland from the macroscale orogenic front (Engelder, 1979; Craddock and van der Pluijm, 1989; 1993; 1999; Ferrill, 1991; Lacombe et al., 2006). Bed-parallel shortening directions normal to the orogenic front (parallel to \u03c3T direction) record maximum principal compressive stress (\u03c31) directions far into the foreland, but the stress field was likely strike-slip regime rather than thrust faulting stress regime. Calcite twin strains within fold thrust belts typically show consistent evidence of shortening in the \u03c3T direction, and orthogonal stretching either perpendicular to bedding or horizontally in the \u03c3P direction (e.g., Evans and Dunne, 1991; Ferrill and Groshong, 1993; Smart et al., 1997). These observations are consistent with shortening in the \u03c3T direction within both strike-slip and thrust faulting stress regimes during progressive deformation.\nFold-thrust belts are expected to experience the full five-stage sequence, along with added complexity from large-scale folding and thrust faulting related to structural and mechanical stratigraphic position. When microscale and mesoscale deformation cannot keep pace with shortening, large-scale folding and faulting in Stage 3 may occur, rotating earlier structures in thrust sheets and fold limbs (Mitra and Yonkee, 1985; Marshak and Engelder, 1985; Yonkee and Weill, 2015; Cawood and Bond, 2018). Early mesostructures may be passively rotated or reactivated by shear or dilation as the local stress field (with respect to layering) rotates due to faulting, folding and inter-bed stress changes (Mitra and Yonkee, 1985; Wilkins et al., 2001). The formation of additional mesostructures during Stage 3 may produce complicated deformation patterns in folded and thrusted rocks as well as overprinting of early structures (e.g., Stearns, 1978; Zahm and Hennings, 2009; Tavani et al., 2015; Jamison, 2016). Additional Stage 3 mesostructures include bedding-plane slip associated with flexural-slip folding (Ramsay, 1967; Wilkins et al., 2014), outer arc extension in folded competent layers (Ramsay, 1967; Evans et al., 2014; Ferrill et al., 2017c), stretching along fold axes (Morris et al., 2012; Ferrill et al., 2017c), and local deformation in thrust fault damage zones (Tavani et al., 2015).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nOur conceptual model for mesostructural development provides a unifying framework to understand the initiation, development, and eventual collapse of a foreland fold-thrust belt through a distinct stress regime sequence with predictable mesostructure patterns: (1) burial in normal faulting regime, (2) early horizontal compression in a strike-slip stress regime, (3) thrust belt compression in a thrust faulting stress regime, (4) late horizontal compression and initial relaxation with return to a strike-slip regime, and (5) extensional relaxation and orogenic collapse in a normal faulting stress regime.\nEarly burial deformation (Stage 1) may occur with no horizontal stress anisotropy and produce polygonal networks of vertical opening mode fractures and normal faults, and bed-parallel compactive failure (e.g., stylolites). Late burial deformation with the onset of horizontal compression imparts a horizontal stress anisotropy that orients opening-mode fractures and normal faults to strike parallel to the regional compression direction.\nContinued compression (Stage 2) leads to a strike-slip deformation regime, with vertical opening-mode fracture networks that initiated in late Stage 1 continuing to form parallel to the compression direction. Conjugate strike-slip faults develop, and vertical compactive failure structures (tectonic stylolites or cleavage, compaction bands) perpendicular to the compression direction start to form.\nThrust-belt compression (Stage 3), defined by a thrust-faulting stress regime, may produce horizontal or bed-parallel opening-mode fractures (beef) and conjugate thrust faults. The network of vertical compactive failure structures that initiated in Stage 2 continues to develop.\nReturn of a strike-slip stress regime (Stage 4) during late compression and initial relaxation reestablishes development of vertical opening mode fractures parallel to the regional compression direction and conjugate strike-slip faults. The network of vertical compactive failure structures that initiated in Stages 2 and 3 continues to be active through this stage due to the persistent regional \u03c31 direction.\nExtensional relaxation (Stage 5) leads to a normal faulting stress regime wherein regional extension eventually occurs in the former regional shortening direction, leading to vertical opening mode fractures and normal faults that strike near-perpendicular to the late extension direction (\u03c3T), and orogenic collapse may occur. Compactive deformation features (especially stylolites and pressure-solution cleavage) locally reactivate in extension as they are now at a high angle to \u03c33. Horizontal compactive failure surfaces may again form or reactivate.\nThis deformation sequence explains the common occurrence of vertical regional-compression-parallel opening mode fractures as potentially initiating during the late Stage 1 in a normal faulting stress regime and continuing through Stage 2 in a strike-slip regime. A persistent maximum principal stress direction through Stages 2, 3, and 4 also produces subtle cleavage and tectonic stylolites in the foreland that intensifies into a penetrative cleavage fabric in the core of many fold-thrust belts. This conceptual model for progressive fold-thrust belt stress and deformation explains common suites of mesostructures and their sequential development, but can also be used to (i) predict mesostructural suites in different regional tectonic positions, (ii) explain apparently anomalous, but inherited, structures, and (iii) infer paleostress history.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nDavid A.

In crystalline rocks with low porosity, permeability is mainly supported by a network of natural fractures (Caine et al., 1996; Faulkner et al., 2010). Fluid is circulated through fracture zones (FZ), which are made of a fault core and damage zones (Caine et al., 1996). The fluid circulation can be enhanced by the presence of active and tensile stresses, normal faults, fracture propagation strike-slip faults and fractures associated with hot springs (Barton et al., 1995; Curewitz and Karson, 1997; Gudmundsson et al., 2002; Faulds et al., 2011; Mitchell and Faulkner, 2012). The occurrence of hydrothermal alteration could contribute to the fluid circulation due to residual channelling occurring inside secondary mineralization, such as automorphic quartz creating incomplete clogging in the FZ core. Hydrothermal alteration could also contribute through the dissolving of primary minerals, which creates some residual porosity in the nearby FZ damage zone (Led\u00e9sert et al., 1999). Conversely, fluid circulation in the FZ can be decreased by hydrothermal alteration in the case of secondary clay minerals precipitation, which can clog the fracture network (Led\u00e9sert et al., 1999).\nIn Europe, the geothermal development occurring in the last 30 years in the naturally fractured reservoirs of the Upper Rhine Graben (URG) has proven the existence of a resource that is mainly located at the base of the Triassic sedimentary unit and the top of the Palaeozoic basement that has industrial hydraulic yields (with a range of approximately 3\u00a0L\/s\/bar) and appropriate temperatures (>150\u00a0\u00b0C) to produce electricity (3 MWe) and\/or heat (25 MWth) (Baumg\u00e4rtner and Lersch, 2013; Baria et al., 2016; Baujard et al., 2017; Vidal and Genter, 2018; Reinecker et al., 2019). More recently, industrial interest in exploiting the lithium concentrations of the geothermal fluid circulating in the fracture network of the URG has increased. The knowledge and characterization of this fracture network are of primary importance to exploit geothermal crystalline fractured reservoirs. The experience has shown that pure hydrothermal concepts lead to the most successful projects (Baujard et al., 2017). Ideally, they do not need Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technologies, which represent an extra cost and often lead to a loss of public acceptance because of the risk of generating induced seismicity (H\u00e4ring et al., 2008; Evans et al., 2012).\nGenerally, fracture networks are studied from relevant outcrops (Brogi, 2008; Bauer et al., 2015). In this paper, we have the opportunity to compare structural data from 3 geothermal sites of the URG, including 8 deep geothermal wells, to understand if there is a structural predisposition to permeability.\nMore precisely, the aim of this study is to determine how the geometry, scaling law and hydrothermal filling impact the permeability of the reservoir. The studied sites are in the French part of the URG, i.e., Soultz-sous-For\u00eats and Rittershoffen, which have been exploiting the natural brine since 2016, and the Illkirch site, which is under exploration by drilling and is still under development. The old and new image log and core data come from 8 geothermal wells that intersect the fracture network in the Muschelkalk limestone, the Buntsandstein sandstone and the granitic Palaeozoic basement. The goal is to identify the unvarying and varying structural properties of the multi-scale fracture networks encountered in the studied wells, including the fracture orientation, density, spacing, thickness and permeability indicators. This high-quality dataset will allow for a better understanding of the ideal geothermal target from the structural point of view in the URG or, more generally, in the European Cenozoic Rift System.\n\n\n2\nStructural development of the URG\nThe URG extends from Frankfurt to Basel, with a maximal width of 30\u201340\u00a0km. It is surrounded by the Vosges mountains forming its western horst and the Black Forest mountains forming its eastern horst, both separated from the graben by local normal faults (Fig. 1\na). These domains belong to the same Saxothuringian unit (Edel and Schulmann, 2009). On both horsts, the basement is outcropping, whereas it is hidden by a thick sedimentary cover within the graben. Thermal anomalies are localized along the normal faults, which are interpreted as thermal convection cells along the faults (Schellschmidt and Clauser, 1996; Pribnow and Schellschmidt, 2000; Baillieux et al., 2013). However, the history of the graben is more complex, and this part presents the main steps of its structural evolution, with a focus on its structural inheritance.\n\n2.1\nVariscan cycle\nThe Variscan cycle is characterized by the intrusion of carboniferous granito\u00efds throughout the crystalline basement from the Visean (340\u00a0Ma) and the Permian (270\u00a0Ma) eras. These granito\u00efds were emplaced following a NE to NNE axis along the main weak zones, such as collisional or shear zones (Lagarde et al., 1992; Altherr et al., 1999, 2000; Edel and Schulmann, 2009). The Variscan cycle is also characterized by several tectonic phases (Fig. 1b). The Sudete phase is the structuration of the orogenesis and consists of a N\u2013S compression generating sinistral NE-SW and dextral NW-SE shear faults (Fig. 1b). Then, an extension along an NNE-SSW axis is observed, which reactivates the normal faults oriented NW-SE to WNW-ESE until the Permian. The Saalian phase is marked by compression and thrusts in the NE-SW direction, which are associated with sinistral NW-SE and dextral E-W shear faults (Burg et al., 1984). The end of the Permian is characterized by a N\u2013S to NNE-SSW extension that forms the Permian basin along faults oriented NE-SW to ENE-WSW (Villemin and Bergerat, 1987; Schumacher, 2002; Ziegler et al., 2006).\n\n\n2.2\nPost-variscan cycle\nThe extension observed at the late Permian continued until the Jurassic in some parts of the URG, inducing fluid migrations and several mineralization events (Clauer et al., 2008; Bossennec et al., 2020). The Cenozoic rifting affects the Variscan basement but also the sediments of the Buntsandstein, the Muschelkalk and the Jurassic. Villemin and Bergerat (1987) and Schumacher (2002) propose a model in 4 tectonic phases (Fig. 1b). First, at the early Eocene, a N\u2013S compression under the Alpine push reactivates ENE-WSW and NNE-SSW structures (Villemin and Bergerat, 1987; Ziegler, 1992; Schumacher, 2002; D\u00e8zes et al., 2004) (Fig. 1b). Then, from the late Eocene to the early Oligocene, an E-W extension with N\u2013S and NNE-SSW faults dominates the rifting phase (Doebl, 1967). At the late Oligocene, a NE-SW compression reactivates the border faults with dextral shear (Villemin and Bergerat, 1987; Schumacher, 2002). At the early Miocene, a NE-SW compression influenced by the Pyrenean push transforms the graben in a shear zone (Illies and Greiner, 1979; Bergerat, 1985; Edel et al., 2006). The most recent tectonic event corresponds to the Alpine NW-SE compression, which uplifts and erodes the crystalline horsts (Vosges and Black Forest) and reactivates the N\u2013S and NE-SW faults inherited from the Variscan and Tertiary eras, respectively (Illies, 1972; D\u00e8zes et al., 2004; Edel et al., 2007). The actual phase reactivates the border faults of the URG in sinistral shear and has an opening effect on the NNW-SSE structures (Michon et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\n\n3.1\nGeothermal reservoir\n\n3.1.1\nSoultz-sous-For\u00eats geothermal project\nSeveral deep wells were drilled into the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats horst structure, which is made of 1.5\u00a0km thick tertiary and secondary sediments and a deep crystalline naturally fractured basement (Fig. 2\n). The Soultz-sous-For\u00eats horst is bounded on its western region by a normal fault that shows a vertical offset of at least 500\u00a0m and is oriented N20\u00b0E (Kappelmeyer, 1991; Genter and Traineau, 1996). In the URG, the sandstones comprise Buntsandstein and Permian. Buntsandstein is deposited in a fluvial environment, is isopach and is approximately 350\u00a0m thick in the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats wells (Aichholzer et al., 2019). The Permian layer, which is a result of continental deposits, is the oldest sedimentary unit in the graben and overlies the granitic basement by filling the paleo-basins; thus, its presence and thickness are difficult to predict (Aichholzer, 2019). In the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats wells, it is approximately 35\u00a0m thick. The granitic basement at Soultz-sous-For\u00eats comprises a monzogranite with K-feldspar mega crystals containing locally high amounts of biotite, dating from 334.0\u00a0+\u00a03.8\/3.5\u00a0Ma and a two-mica granite, which also contains muscovite and dates from 327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma (Stussi et al., 2002; Cocherie et al., 2004). Both Visean ages confirm that the granites were emplaced before the Sudete phase and, thus, keep the structural heritage of the latter. Even if the Permo-Triassic sandstones revealed some permeable fractured zones, the initial target of the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats project was to develop an artificial exchanger in the deepest granite, which is located 3.5\u00a0km under the top of the basement. Thus, several wells were drilled to 5\u00a0km deep and, surprisingly, intersected a permeable natural fracture network that channelized brine (Fig. 3\na and b). A large-scale permeable fault has been identified in the granite with an orientation of N144\u00b0E and a dip of 65\u201370\u00b0W (Sausse et al., 2010). The deep well exploration has shown that the highest natural permeability was found in the shallowest reservoirs of the granite, which means between the top basement and 2\u00a0km. The lessons learned from Soultz-sous-For\u00eats lead to an evolution of the concept for the Rittershoffen project, where geothermal wells were drilled a maximum of 1\u00a0km below the top basement. To date, the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats site comprises 5 deep wells (Fig. 2), with three wells (GPK-2, 3 and 4) that contribute to produce 1.7 MWe for the electrical grid (Mouchot et al., 2019).\n\n\n3.1.2\nRittershoffen geothermal project\nThe Rittershoffen wells, before reaching the granite, intersect approximately 400\u00a0m of Buntsandstein and 10\u00a0m of Ante-Annweiler Permian sandstone layers. In the granitic basement, the wells intersect only monzogranite, which is remarkably similar to the one encountered in the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats wells (Fig. 4\n). The Rittershoffen site comprises two wells, i.e., GRT-1, the injection well, and GRT-2, the production well, which produces 24 MWth for industrial use (Mouchot et al., 2019). The Rittershoffen project took advantage of the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats experience, and the target was the Rittershoffen normal fault, which is located approximately 15\u00a0km east of the western Rhenish border fault and is oriented N5\u00b0E based on subsurface geological data (Baujard et al., 2017). After the drilling of GRT-1 and the realization of a new 2D seismic campaign, the trajectory of GRT-2 was optimized according to the orientation of the Rittershoffen fault (Baujard et al., 2017). The second well is therefore slightly deviated but tangent to the local fault over its approximately 400\u00a0m length in the granitic basement (Fig. 4). Its high productivity index of 4\u00a0L\/s\/bar without any stimulation revealed a good connexion between the well and the fracture network (Baujard et al., 2017). The well probably intersects the fault zone characterized by a high fracture density with optimized natural fluid pathways (Vidal et al., 2017). The hydrothermal concept has been extremely positive for the GRT-2 well (Vidal and Genter, 2018).\n\n\n3.1.3\nIllkirch geothermal project\nThe Illkirch well, before reaching the basement, intersects 170\u00a0m MD (156\u00a0m TVD) of Buntsandstein, which is approximately 300\u00a0m thick in total (Aichholzer, 2019) (Fig. 5\n). No Permian is intersected due to the GIL-1 well trajectory, but the presence of Permian was found to be between 50 and 200\u00a0m in the deep wells in the near wells (Housse, 1984; Richard et al., 2016; Aichholzer, 2019). The granitic basement intersected by the GIL-1 well comprises monzogranite, which seems to be similar to the one encountered in the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats and Rittershoffen wells and is sometimes enriched with biotite. The target of the Illkirch project was the Eschau normal fault oriented N10\u00b0E based on 2D seismic interpretation (Richard et al., 2016), which is intersected by the well at the interface between Triassic sandstone and granite (Fig. 5). In the open-hole section of the well, the GIL-1 well was drilled in the NW-SE azimuth to intersect the fault at a high angle. To date, hydraulic tests tend to show that the permeability is mostly located in the deepest fractured granite.\nThese three geothermal sites explored by deep drilling have penetrated from 1 to 3.5\u00a0km into a deep fractured basement. To date, the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats and Rittershoffen sites are exploited for energy production, whereas at the Illkirch site, only one well has been drilled. Various techniques have been used for collecting high quality fracture datasets, such as continuous coring and electric\/acoustic borehole images. These datasets have been collected in all the wells, thus providing the opportunity to compare the structural characteristics, such as the fracture orientation, fracture density, fracture spacing, fracture thickness and fracture permeability.\n\n\n\n3.2\nStructural analyses\n\n3.2.1\nCore samples\nAt Soultz-sous-For\u00eats, in the EPS-1 well, the structural data of 810\u00a0m of continuous coring from 1420 to 2230\u00a0m was analysed by (Genter and Traineau, 1996) (Fig. 3a). Approximately 3000 macroscopic natural fractures were identified, and 97% of them where successfully reoriented by comparing the core and acoustic borehole imagery. The orientations, depths and thicknesses of the natural fractures, as well as the type of secondary fillings (quartz, haematite, carbonates, clay minerals, chlorite, epidote, barite, anhydrite, pyrite and galena) were described with great care (Genter and Traineau, 1996).\n\n\n3.2.2\nAcoustic image logs\nThe Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI) developed by Schlumberger in 1990 comprises a rotative transducer emitting an acoustic wave towards the borehole wall that records the amplitude and transit time of the wave after its reflection from the rock (Zemaneck et al., 1970). Acoustic imagers allow an image to be obtained that covers 100% of the borehole circumference (Fig. 3c). The UBI images are presented with an image in amplitude (dB), which provides information on the borehole roughness and quality, and an image in transit time (\u03bcs), which measures the distance between the tool and the borehole and informs on the borehole geometry (Serra and Serra, 2000). The colour scale shows the borehole expansions due to fractures and caves in dark colours (black), and the unaffected standard borehole diameter appears in light colours (yellow-orange). Natural fractures appear as sinusoids on the unrolled UBI images, which allows the dip, orientation and thickness of the fractures to be measured (Fig. 3c). The UBI log is oriented and the natural fractures measured on the images are then corrected with the borehole trajectory.\n\n\n3.2.3\nElectrical image logs\nResistivity image logs were developed by Schlumberger in 1986 as the Formation Micro-Scanner (FMS), which evolved into the Formation Micro-Imager (FMI) (Fig. 3b). To date, other companies, such as Weatherford, have developed similar tools, such as the Compact Micro-Imager (CMI). These various tools all comprise dipmeter pads, which comprise electrodes, which allow each pad to record the number of microresistivity curves that corresponds to the number of electrodes (Schlumberger, 1993; Crain, 1998). The number of pads increased during the evolution of the tool to reach 8 pads today, covering 80% of the borehole circumference in an 8\u201d hole size (Fig. 3c, Table 1\n). The resistivity images are presented with a static and a dynamic image, where the static image is normalized over the complete depth interval logged; thus, the contrast responds to large-scale variations in lithology, porosity and saturation, whereas the dynamic image is normalized using a sliding window of 0.5\u00a0m; this highlights small-scale variations in the electrical contrast due to bedding, fractures, and changes in porosity (Fig. 3d and e). As on the UBI images, natural fractures appearing as sinusoids are measured and reoriented in the same way. The colour scale shows resistive materials in light colours (yellow-orange), whereas conductive materials appear in dark colours (black). As both the very saline brine and the clay minerals are very conductive, a black fracture on both the static and dynamic images could even be interpreted as an open fracture with very saline and conductive brine, or as a clogged fracture filled by conductive secondary clay minerals.\nThe Azimuthal Resistivity Imager (ARI) was developed by Schlumberger in the early 90's. It is a dual laterolog array with 12 azimuthal electrodes incorporated in its upper electrode, which provide a dozen deep oriented resistivity measurements in addition to the standard deep and shallow readings (LLD and LLS) (Schlumberger, 1993) (Table 1). The data is then displayed as an azimuthal resistivity image (Schlumberger, 1993) (Fig. 3). This image has much lower spatial resolution than the other acoustic or electrical images, but the interest is to use it as a complement to the other types of imageries, as its sensitivity to features beyond the borehole wall is higher. In the GPK-2 well, the ARI was acquired separately, and thus, only the depth of the fractures could be described.\n\n\n3.2.4\nSpatial resolution of fracture analysis\nThe different tools used for this study have roughly the same resolution, except for the core samples and the ARI (Table 1). It has been shown that even equivalent resolution borehole imagery techniques are not as exhaustive as the core data and cannot provide a complete characterization of the fracture network, as discrete fractures thinner than 1\u00a0mm are not properly detected and fractures closer to 5\u00a0mm appear only as single traces (Genter et al., 1997). However, for all techniques, the fracture orientation was shown to be correctly sampled (Genter et al., 1997). More precisely, Crain (1998) found that when comparing the same generation tools, the electrical images are more accurate than the acoustic images, even if the electrical images only cover 80% of the borehole circumference. The ARI is also the imagery method with the lower resolution, but it allows the detection of features and perturbations beyond the borehole wall; there is interest in using this in parallel with other electric or acoustic images. Usually, fractures from the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats and Rittershoffen datasets are classified according to their visibility on the image logs, for example, if they are visible on 100%, 50%, or 30% of the image, or if they are uncertain (Dezayes et al., 2010; Vidal et al., 2016, 2019). For this study, all the fractures classified as \u201cuncertain\u201d or visible on less than 50% of the image logs were not considered.\n\n\n3.2.5\nFracture thickness\nDuring the drilling, a mechanical erosion of the surface of the fracture rims would usually occur. Regardless of the imagery technique, this effect overestimates the natural fracture thickness because the fractures appear larger on the image than in reality. This effect does not exist on core samples, especially with a core recovery close to 100%, as we had in EPS-1 (Fig. 3) (Genter and Traineau, 1996). Then, the different imagery and coring techniques do not precisely consider the same fracture thicknesses scale.\n\n-\nFor the core samples, we measure the mechanical thickness, which corresponds to the normal distance between the two consecutive walls of a given fracture (Fig. 3a). All the natural fractures observed at Soultz-sous-For\u00eats are mineralized with secondary minerals, such as quartz, clay minerals, barite, and calcite. Thus, the fracture thickness corresponds to the clogged thickness and could include the residual fracture hydraulic aperture if the clogging is incomplete (Fig. 3a). On EPS-1 cores, less than 1% of the natural fractures present incomplete clogging by hydrothermal minerals. From the EPS-1 core analyses, 3000 fractures are characterized, and all the natural fractures are systematically filled by at least one or several secondary hydrothermal minerals (Genter and Traineau, 1996).\n\n\n-\nRegarding the electrical images, the electrical thickness includes the clogged fracture and its nearby hydrothermally altered environment, corresponding to the beginning of the damage zone (Fig. 3b, d & e). It matches our geothermal wells in basement rocks to clay minerals, such as illites, that have the same electrical signature as the fracture itself, generally filled by illite or a conductive fluid. Thus, it becomes quite difficult to differentiate the precise trace of the fracture on the borehole wall. If we add potential mechanical erosion due to the drilling processes, we assume that the fracture thicknesses observed on the electrical images are potentially larger than those on the core samples. The hydraulic aperture, if it exists, is included in this electrical thickness. The electrical thickness tends to be larger than the mechanical thickness.\n\n\n-\nRegarding the acoustic images, the acoustic thickness includes the clogged fracture closer to the mechanical thickness but does not systematically include its nearby altered environment (Fig. 3c). The hydraulic thickness, if it exists, is included in this acoustic thickness. According to the cases, the acoustic aperture can be larger or smaller than the mechanical aperture (Genter et al., 1992; Vidal et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nFracture orientation\n\n4.1.1\nSoultz-sous-For\u00eats\nThe orientation of the natural fracture set is quite similar in the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats wells to a conjugate fracture set striking N000 E \u00b1 10\u00b0 and highly dipping (Fig. 2b) (Dezayes et al., 2010). In all the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats wells and in all the formations, the main fracture set dips to the West. In the Buntsandstein, the fracture data available are exclusively from the core samples of the EPS-1 well and express a conjugate set comprising fractures striking N170\u00b0E and steep dips of 80\u00b0 (Fig. 3). In the monzogranite, the fracture data are from the 5 wells and behave in the same way as the conjugate set in the Buntsandstein but with less steep dips of 75\u00b0 (Fig. 3). In the deeper two-mica granite, the fracture set striking N000 E \u00b1 10\u00b0 and dipping to the West is more visible (Fig. 3).\n\n\n4.1.2\nRittershoffen\nIn both the GRT-1 and GRT-2 wells, the fractures roughly strike in the N\u2013S direction but a divergence of dip is observed between both wells (Figs. 2b and 4). In the GRT-1 well, the main set dips to the West, whereas in the GRT-2 well, the main set dips to the East (Figs. 2b and 4). In the Muschelkalk, fracture data are only available in the GRT-1 well and show a main fracture set oriented N006\u00b0E and dipping 62\u00b0W (Fig. 3b). In the Buntsandstein, fracture data for both wells are available, in the GRT-1 well a fracture set strikes N020\u00b0E and dips 69\u00b0W, which is quite different from the conjugate fracture set observed in the GRT-2 well, which strikes N160-170\u00b0E and steeply dips 88\u00b0W and 79\u00b0E (Fig. 3b). In the granite, the GRT-1 well presents a conjugate fracture set that strikes N010\u00b0E and dips 56\u00b0W and 73\u00b0E; the GRT-2 well also presents a conjugate fracture set, but it is oriented N155-174\u00b0E and has dips 75\u00b0W and 52\u00b0E, which are associated with a minor fracture set striking 122\u00b0E and dipping 75\u00b0W (Fig. 3b).\n\n\n4.1.3\nIllkirch\nAt Illkirch, the fracture data results from the GIL-1 well, where the fracture orientation in the sediments strikes NE-SW, but differs from those observed in the granite that strikes NW-SE (Figs. 2b and 5). In the sediments, the main fracture set dips to the West whereas in the granite, it dips to the East (Figs. 2b and 5). The fractures in the Muschelkalk are highly dispersed due to the small amount of data collected and present a nearly-vertical conjugate set striking N028\u00b0E (Figs. 2b and 5). In the Buntsandstein, the fractures also present a conjugate set but strike approximately N035\u00b0E with a steep dip of 80\u00b0 (Fig. 2b). In the granite, a conjugate set striking N148-163\u00b0E and dipping 76\u00b0W and 48\u00b0W is observed (Fig. 2b). Note that the Eschau fault was intersected by the well with a local orientation of N30\u00b0E and a general orientation of N10\u00b0E from the 2D seismic data.\n\n\n\n4.2\nPermeable fractures\nAll the geothermal wells presented in this paper intersected natural fractures considered as permeable. A natural fracture was considered permeable if there was at least a temperature anomaly and another permeability indicator, such as mud losses or outlets, and gaz anomalies (Evans et al., 2005; Vidal et al., 2017, 2018, 2019). In this study, we only included natural fractures that were already permeable prior to any type of stimulation. The permeable fractures with their structural data and the associated permeability indicators are presented in the supplementary materials. However, it is important to consider that these permeable fractures are most often within a larger fracture zone (FZ). They generally act as the main fluid pathways of the FZ, are easily detected on core samples or in image logs and are surrounded by a damage zone (Fig. 3) (Genter et al., 2000; Vidal et al., 2017; Vidal and Genter, 2018). The permeable FZs in the granite from Soultz-sous-For\u00eats and Rittershoffen were deeply developed by Vidal et al. (2019) and Dezayes et al. (2010) and those in the sediments were developed by (Vidal et al., 2015, 2017).\nAt Soultz-sous-For\u00eats, in the GPK-1 well, 4 permeable FZs were detected in the granite, 1 in the Buntsandstein, 2 permeable but partly sealed FZs were also observed in the Muschelkalk and the Keuper. In the EPS-1 well, 1 permeable FZ was detected in the granite and 1 in the Buntsandstein. In the GPK-2 well, 6 permeable FZs were detected in the granite, 1 in the Buntsandstein and 2 in the Muschelkalk. In the GPK-3 well, 5 permeable FZs were observed in the granite, 2 in the Buntsandstein and 2 in the Muschelkalk. In the GPK-4 well, 7 permeable FZs were detected in the granite, 1 in the Buntsandstein and 1 in the Muschelkalk.\nAt Rittershoffen, in the GRT-1 well, 2 permeable FZs were detected in the granite and 1 in the Muschelkalk. In the GRT-2 well, 4 permeable FZs were observed in the granite, 1 in the Buntsandstein and 1 in the Permian.\nAt Illkirch, in the GIL-1 well, permeable FZs were detected in the electrical image logs. In the granite, 6 permeable FZs were detected from 3050 to 3090, 3210 to 3230, 3309 to 3315, 3330 to 3390, 3500 to 3575, and 3625\u20133645\u00a0m MD. They are all associated with a temperature anomaly (Glaas et al., 2021). Surprisingly, the fracture considered as the intersection of the Eschau fault does not present a temperature anomaly and, thus, is not considered as naturally permeable. On the other hand, a temperature anomaly is associated with the intrusion of the biotite-rich granite structures inside the batholith and suggest that dyke or sill could represent a heterogeneity and a localized permeability. Only one permeable FZ was intersected within the Buntsandstein in GIL-1 from 2780 to 2785\u00a0m MD.\nMore generally, in the 3 geothermal sites, we lack oriented data in the sedimentary part. Due to this lack, only 9 permeable fractures could be represented in Fig. 6\nb.\nPermeable fractures are globally striking NNW-SSE (Fig. 6a). In the sediments, the permeable fractures present a conjugate set striking N175\u00b0E and dipping 75\u00b0E and W (Fig. 6b). In the granitic basement of Soultz-sous-For\u00eats, the permeable fractures intersected by the wells present a conjugate set striking N164\u00b0E and dipping 85\u00b0E and W (Fig. 6c). In the granitic basement of Rittershoffen, the permeable fractures intersected by the wells present a conjugate set striking N003-168\u00b0E and dipping 82\u00b0E and W (Fig. 6c). In the granitic basement of Illkirch, the permeable fractures intersected by the well present a conjugate set striking N149\u00b0E and dipping 86\u00b0E and W (Fig. 6c). For the three sites, the maximum horizontal stress direction is sub-parallel to the permeable fracture strike\u00b110\u00b0 (Valley and Evans, 2007; Hehn et al., 2016).\n\n\n4.3\nFracture density\nIn the granite, the EPS-1 fracture set from the core samples presents the highest fracture density of 3.85 (Fig. 7\nb). The EPS-1 well presents two main sections; the first 150\u00a0m are highly fractured (6.7 frac\/m), and the deepest section is less fractured (4.7 frac\/m) (Fig. 7a).\nThe other wells present fracture datasets from the acoustic and electric image logs collected from the 3 geothermal sites. In the sandstone of the Buntsandstein, the fracture densities are low, from 0.40 to 0.66 frac\/m, whereas in the granite, they show a wide range of fracture density values from 0.36 to 1.60 frac\/m. In the granitic basement, the cumulative fracture densities were separated in several depth interval sections, which are roughly the same for all the wells (Fig. 7a and b). More precisely, GIL-1 and GPK-2 show quite similar fracture density values, i.e., 1.6 frac\/m for GIL-1 and 1.2 frac\/m for GPK-2 in the first 900\u00a0m of the granitic basement. GIL-1 does not descend deeper into the granitic basement, but below, in GPK-2, two different sections are observed, as follows: from 900 to 1800\u00a0m and from 1800 to 3000\u00a0m below the top of the granitic basement, where the fracture densities are of 0.6 and 0.2 frac\/m, respectively. GPK-3 and GPK-4 show exactly the same depth interval sections with similar ranges of fracture densities (Fig. 7). Both wells can be separated into 4 distinct depth sections, as follows: the first 450\u00a0m show fracture densities of 0.8 and 0.9 frac\/m, respectively; from 450 to 1350\u00a0m below the top basement, the fracture density is of 0.4 frac\/m; from 1350 to 1920 below the top basement, the fracture density is of 0.8 frac\/m for both wells; and from 1920 to 3000\u00a0m below the top basement, the fracture density values are of 0.4 and 0.2 frac\/m, respectively. This last depth interval is also observed in the GPK-2 well, which also has a fracture density of 0.2 frac\/m. However, the deepest part of GPK-2, representing a length of approximately 600\u00a0m, was never characterized with borehole image logs due to the borehole conditions. GPK-1, which is characterized by fracture data interpreted from former electrical image logs (FMS & FMI), presents the lowest fracture density value of 0.36 frac\/m in the granite (Fig. 7b).\nFrom a general point of view, we observe that the fracture density versus depth is higher in the first 500\u20131000\u00a0m of the granitic basement and that from 1900 to 3000\u00a0m below the top basement of Soultz-sous-For\u00eats, the fracture density is lower. GRT-1 presents a fracture density very similar to GPK-2, 3 and \u22124 in the granitic section (0.57), whereas it is slightly higher for GRT-2 (0.79) (Fig. 2b).\n\n\n4.4\nFracture spacing\nTo facilitate a comparison, the fracture spacing curves in the granite were normalized for all the wells by applying a correction factor that was determined by dividing each well section by the longest available well section in the basement. The longest well section where fracture data are available is the GPK-4 well granitic section, which is 3831\u00a0m. For each well, this correction factor was applied to the fracture spacing distribution plotted on a log-log scale (Fig. 8\n). The maximal spacing can be estimated by the projection of the distribution curve on the horizontal axis. We observe that all the largest fracture spacings converge towards a pluridecametric value ranging between 20 and 80\u00a0m, except for EPS-1, GPK-2 and GRT-1, where the largest spacing tends to converge to values higher than 100\u00a0m (Fig. 8). The coefficients of variation (CV) were also calculated for each well by dividing the standard deviation by the average (Fig. 8). All the wells present CV values higher than 1, which is usually associated with a clustered organization of spacing, meaning a heterogeneous distribution of the fractures along the depth, with closely spaced fractures alternating with large spaces between the fractures. The higher the CV, the more the organization is clustered (Odling et al., 1999; Gillespie et al., 2001).\nThe fracture spacing distribution for EPS-1 fits a perfect straight line on the log-log graph for more than two decades (Fig. 8a), which means that the fracture spacings are governed by a power law having an exponent of \u22121.07. As the resolution of the fracture analysis with core samples is the highest, it means that the sampling biases are minimized. Thus, the power law distribution and the highest CV for fracture spacings, which is 5.56 in the basement, reflects a highly heterogeneous fracture distribution in the rock mass (Fig. 8).\nWith the example of the Rittershoffen wells where the same UBI was used, we can also compare the results obtained in terms of the fracture spacing distribution (Fig. 8c and d). GRT-2 presents a negative exponential law with the lowest CV (1.21), which reflects a low clustered organization of fractures in the well (Fig. 8d), whereas GRT-1 presents a power law, which reflects a fracture distribution in clusters (Fig. 8c). Geologically, it is assumed that GRT-2 tangentially intersects the local Rittershoffen normal fault at a 400\u00a0m thick section through its damage zone. This assumption means that an intermediate density of fractures of 0.79 frac\/mm (Fig. 7b) over several hundreds of metres in accordance with the distribution law is encountered. In contrast, GRT-1 crosses the fault perpendicularly to enter the low altered granite associated with a lower fracture density (0,57 frac\/mm, Fig. 7b), which could validate the heterogeneous fracture distribution and cluster organization, as observed in Fig. 8c and d. Note that a truncation bias is visible at the end of the curve of GRT-1 because the length of the studied section is not long enough for a complete sampling (Fig. 8c). The other bias is the censoring, which is visible at the beginning of the curve and is explained because fractures that are too closely spaced cannot be sampled with the borehole imagery technique, unlike with the core sample (Odling et al., 1999; Gillespie et al., 2001). In fact, censoring is visible on all the curves excepted on the EPS-1 curve, where all the closely spaced fractures are correctly detected and sampled (Fig. 8a). Due to the effects of truncation and censoring, the power law of GRT-1 fits approximately one decade (Fig. 8c). Surprisingly, GRT-1 fits a power law but has a low CV (1.84), which could be explained by the fact that the effects of censoring and truncation are important. These observations show that the fracture distribution is well represented by the law but that the tool resolution can influence the CV value.\nIn GIL-1, the fracture distribution fits a negative exponential law quite well, which means that the fracture spacings are more homogeneously distributed, as in the GRT-2 well (Fig. 8b and d). Maybe the fit between the raw curve and the extrapolated law is not perfect because of the electrical tool resolution for GIL-1, which is higher than for the acoustic tool for the other wells, enabling the sampling of the closest fractures. It could more accurately reflect the \u201cnatural system\u201d in GIL-1 than in GRT-2, for example. In the case of GIL-1, the low CV (1.74) is in agreement with its fit with a negative exponential law, reflecting a low clustered fracture distribution of spacings (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n4.5\nFracture thickness\nIn Fig. 9\n, the fracture thickness is represented as cumulated along the depth for the three geothermal sites. The permeable fractures identified by various techniques in the corresponding wells were superimposed on the curves as coloured disks (Fig. 9).\nIn GPK-3, GRT-1 and GRT-2, the curves show stair-like trends, with the plateau parts showing zones with high cumulated fracture thicknesses and the vertical parts showing zones with lower cumulated fracture thicknesses (Fig. 9a and b). This indicates the existence of a fracture thickness distribution in clusters of intensively clogged fractures and zones depleted in fractures with very high clogging. For EPS-1, some steps are also observed (Fig. 9a) that correspond to high fracture thickness zones that were observed on cores (Sausse et al., 1998). For the GIL-1 well, the curve trend is slightly different, with a fracture thickness distribution that shows a rather regular slope with depth. It could correspond to a regular distribution with depth of thicker natural fractures (Fig. 9c).\nAt Soultz-sous-For\u00eats, in the EPS-1 well, the fracture thickness curve presents two plateaus, i.e., one at 1600\u00a0m TVD and one at 2150\u00a0m TVD, which are associated with permeable FZs (Fig. 9a). The thickest secondary quartz filling was observed in a permeable FZ with an apparent fracture thickness of 40\u00a0cm, located at 2174\u00a0m, and it is found in the deepest plateau (Figs. 3a and 9a) (Genter et Traineau, 1996). In the GPK-3 well, there are at least 10 plateaus, and we observe that the permeable FZs are systematically related to the thickest fractures (plateau) (Fig. 9a). In contrast, thicker fractures are not systematically naturally permeable, for example, at 3200\u00a0m TVD. In the GPK-3 well, from the top basement to 2100\u00a0m TVD, the fractures are thicker and 4 of the 5 permeable fractures are concentrated in these 600 first metres of the granitic basement (Fig. 9a). The most permeable FZ is located in GPK-2 at 2100\u00a0m TVD and shows hydraulic index of 20\u00a0L\/s\/bar (Jung et al., 2010; Schill et al., 2017). In GPK-3, below this FZ, there is a drop in the fracture thickness, except at 4770\u00a0m TVD, where there is a cluster of thick fractures associated with high natural permeability controlling 70% of the natural flow (Gentier et al., 2005; Sausse et al., 2010).\nAt Rittershoffen, in the GRT-1 well, we observe a dozen plateaus, and slightly less are observed in the GRT-2 well (Fig. 9b). In the GRT-1 well, both the permeable FZs are associated with plateaus, and in the GRT-2 well, the permeable FZs are not systematically linked to plateaus. In the GRT-1 and GRT-2 wells, until 2300\u00a0m TVD, the fracture thickness is small, except at 2270\u00a0m TVD in GRT-1 and 2260\u00a0m TVD in GRT-2. From 2300 to 2400\u00a0m TVD, we observe a thick fracture filling, which means between 100 and 200\u00a0m below the top basement. The Rittershoffen fault is supposed to be intersected by the GRT-1 well at 2328\u20132368\u00a0m MD (2312\u20132352\u00a0m TVD) and by the GRT-2 well at 2766\u20132800\u00a0m MD (2382\u20132410\u00a0m TVD) (Vidal et al., 2017). In the granite in the GRT-2 well, 5 of the 7 permeable fractures are located in this interval. In the granite of the GRT-1 well, both permeable fractures are also located in this interval. Another interesting observation is that between 2200 and 2300\u00a0m, the cumulative fracture thickness is extremely low for these 2 wells. This interval corresponds to the propylitic monzogranite, which is very slightly altered. The fracture thickness is extremely low in this interval, except for the top basement, which is a reddish granite from 2170 to 2200\u00a0m TVD in GRT-2 and from 2215 to 2222\u00a0m MD TVD in GRT-1. The top of the reddish granite contains thicker fractures and is altered with a reddish colour, which is clearly because of paleo weathering (Glaas et al., 2018; Vidal and Genter, 2018).\nAt Illkirch, GIL-1 shows a quite regular fracture thickness distribution with depth, and there is no plateau trend, contrary to the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats or Rittershoffen wells (Fig. 9c). The permeable fractures are not related to the thickest fractures (Fig. 9c). However, we can observe a slightly higher fracture thickness from 2700 to 2830\u00a0m TVD, which means between 40 and 200\u00a0m below the top basement. Although a high fracture thickness is observed in the GIL-1 well, only 2 of the 13 permeable fractures are located in these first 200\u00a0m of the granitic section. The 11 other permeable fractures are located far below the first 200\u00a0m of the granitic basement. All permeable fractures are localized in sections where there is a high cumulative fracture thickness, except at 3185 and 3189\u00a0m TVD.\nWe calculated the fracture thickness densities expressed in mm\/m for each well (Table 2\n). Surprisingly, the fracture thickness density is the lowest in EPS-1, with approximatively 5\u00a0mm\/m. This could be due to the method of measuring the fracture thickness, which is very accurate on cores compared to the electrical or acoustical methods, which could overestimate the fracture thickness. GRT-2 presents the lowest fracture thickness density (8.8\u00a0mm\/m), and the GRT-1 density is slightly higher (13.4\u00a0mm\/m). The GPK-3 and GIL-1 wells show quite similar fracture thickness density values of approximately 2\u00a0mm\/m in the first 800\u00a0m; this is the highest value and is 4 times higher than that of EPS-1 and is approximately 2 times higher than that of the GRT-1 well. In the GPK-3 and GIL-1 wells, we see that the fracture thickness density is higher in the top portions of the granite (20 and 29\u00a0mm\/m respectively) than in its deepest sections (4.3 and 20\u00a0mm\/m respectively). The mean values of the fracture thicknesses were also calculated (Table 2). In the first 800\u00a0m of the granite, the EPS-1 well presents the lowest value (4\u00a0mm), the GIL-1 and GRT-2 wells present average values (between 11 and 14\u00a0mm) and the GRT-1 and GPK-3 wells present higher values (18.5 and 33.6\u00a0mm, respectively).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nIs the permeability linked to the structural and hydrothermal inheritance?\nWe observe a vertical clockwise rotation of the fracture orientation in the studied wells from NNW-SSE\/N\u2013S in the underlying granitic basement to N\u2013S\/NNE-SSW in the overburden sediments (Fig. 2b). The nearly vertical fracture network intersected in the granite could be inherited from the late-Variscan tectonic history of the URG, whereas the sediments could be affected by more recent regional stress fields, mainly from the Cenozoic era. The direction of the fractures in the granite could correspond to that of the Variscan era. They could belong to a larger network of Variscan normal faults reactivated under the Pyrenean compression that took place at the Eocene era (Villemin and Bergerat, 1987). In the granite, a change of the dominating dip direction (E or W) depending on the wells and the depths is observed (Dezayes et al., 2010). It is interesting to notice that the geometry of the permeable fractures in the granite is well constrained with the main striking values; NNW-SSE for Soultz-sous-For\u00eats, N\u2013S for Rittershoffen and NNW-SSE for Illkirch. These directions could correspond to structures with dips approximately 70\u00b0 (Fig. 2b), which could be associated with Variscan normal faults. They could be reactivated into shear faults under the Pyrenean compression at the Eocene or into normal faults under the Rhine Graben extension at the Oligocene (Villemin and Bergerat, 1987). However, in the sediments, the fracture orientation is slightly different from that in the granite but is more consistent with the Cenozoic stress field (Fig. 2b). In the sediments and the granite, permeable fractures strike from NW-SE to NNW-SSE, which could suggest that their present-day permeability is directly linked to the trans-tensional horizontal stress field because they are critically stressed (Evans et al., 2005) (Figs. 1b and 6c). They could tend to open both by dilatancy and by shearing, which are favourable conditions for permeability. Structural inheritance is guided by the geological tectonic history, which reactivated the same structural directions (NW to NNW). The ENE direction is poorly represented by the drilling data or other outcrop studies, while it is suggested to be a permeable direction by other large scale geophysical studies (Dezayes and Lerouge, 2019; Bertrand et al., 2020). This direction is interpreted as structures delimiting large blocks (Bertrand et al., 2020).\nThe inherited fracture directions and the actual stress orientation and magnitude are not the only factors that could explain the fracture permeability. In fact, it was observed in all the geothermal wells that the fractures in the granite are more permeable than those in the Triassic sandstones. For example, in GRT-2, it was demonstrated that the main hydraulic contribution comes from a FZ in the granitic basement, even if FZs with the same orientation were also intersected in the sediments (Baujard et al., 2017; Vidal et al., 2017). This could be linked to the internal organization of the FZ. Indeed, at the borehole scale, the FZs in the granite present a core with cm-thick open fractures that channelize the geothermal resource. These fractures systematically correspond to the thickest fractures encountered in the wells (Fig. 9). In addition to this structural inheritance, a hydrothermal inheritance is also predisposing the fracture permeability. The hydrothermal inheritance is due to the successive hydrothermal events that occur in the fracture network and provoke primary mineral dissolution and secondary mineral precipitation cycles. The residual effect is complex FZs with hydrothermally altered and porous damage zones of several m-thick, where intense fluid-rock ratios occurred and led to mineral infillings that could block the permeability over time. In the sediments, the fault core generally comprises thinner fractures and lower fracture densities. Thus, the resulting connectivity of the fractures is less important and hinders reaching interesting hydraulic properties from sedimentary hard-rocks for geothermal exploitation (Vidal and Genter, 2018). According to our extensive core observations, we consider the fracture thickness to be a good proxy for the fracture hydrothermal filling rate. In the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats and Rittershoffen wells, the cumulative fracture thickness versus the depth shows the occurrence of the thickest fractures partly filled by hydrothermal minerals, which alternates with FZs depleted of thick fractures. The occurrence of permeable fractures is systematically associated with the thickest fractures with residual channels. In contrast, in the Illkirch well, the fracture thickness is regularly distributed along the depth and there is no clear relation between the permeable fractures and their thicknesses. Our observations could then show that the permeability in the granite is associated with the thickest fractures with channels where an intense fluid-rock ratio occurred, producing thick fracture infillings but where the permeability is maintained over time. The most permeable well of this study (GRT-2, Rittershoffen) presents an average fracture density (0.79 frac\/m) and the lowest mean fracture thickness (11.3\u00a0mm). This shows that the relation between permeability and fracture thickness is valid for a given wells but is less robust for inter-site well comparison. Indeed, the lowest permeable well of this study (GIL-1, Illkirch) presents the highest fracture density (1.60 frac\/m) and a fracture thickness (14\u00a0mm) higher than GRT-2. The residual permeability of the fracture depends on the competing geochemical equilibrium between the dissolution and precipitation processes, which allows to preserve, or not, natural fluid channels. The local normal fault at the interface between the sandstone and the granite encountered at Illkirch probably underwent a very intense fluid\/rock ratio, which generated primary mineral dissolution and secondary clay precipitation and clogged the residual permeability. The reason of a higher fluid\/rock ratio in the Illkirch reservoir could be due to the local thermal or geochemical disequilibrium between the brine and the faulted rocks, including the Buntsandstein sandstone and granitic basement. In fact, the sandstone-granite fault at Illkirch could influence the nature and the amount of the clogging differently than the intra-granite faults, such as those in Soultz-sous-For\u00eats and Rittershoffen. Additionally, the km-length vertical offset of the Eschau fault could explain the mineral clogging due to the high fluid\/rock ratio, as well as the smearing induced by the clayey Permian layers.\n\n\n5.2\nWhich is the most permeable reservoir?\nThe dataset studied in this paper reveals that the initial permeability is very localized and intimately linked to the fractures in both the sediments and granite.\nThe most permeable reservoir in the URG is the top of the granitic basement (Vidal and Genter, 2018). The highest fracture density and thickest fractures are located in the first 500\u20131000\u00a0m of the hidden granitic basement (Figs. 7 and 9). By excluding the bias of the tool resolution, the highest fracture density values are observed in GIL-1 and GPK-2 (1.6 and 1.2 frac\/m, respectively). Even if GIL-1 has a higher fracture density than GRT-2 (0.79 frac\/m), the natural permeability of GIL-1 is lower. GRT-2 also presents a lower fracture thickness density and a lower fracture thickness average compared to GIL-1. For example, the trajectory of the deviated GRT-2 well intersects the Rittershoffen fault zone over a length of more than 400\u00a0m and provides the best hydraulic productivity index due to connection between the well and the fracture network in the near-well field (Baujard et al., 2017). Indeed, this fracture network intersected (NNW-SSE) is colinear to the local fault roughly N\u2013S. The fracture distribution in GRT-2 is quite regular, with a negative exponential law (Fig. 8d) but with a high concentration of localized permeable fractures at the intersection of the Rittershoffen fault zone extending throughout the entire granitic part of the well (Fig. 7). These observations tend to show that more than the fracture density, it is the connection of the fractures intersected by a larger fault zone that contributes to the natural permeability (Neuman, 2008).\nAt Soultz-sous-For\u00eats, the local Soultz fault oriented N020\u00b0E was intersected in the Triassic formations and revealed natural permeability (Traineau et al., 1992; Vidal et al., 2015). However, the permeable fracture network intersected in the granite, which is oriented NNW-SSE, is probably more connected to a series of highly connected local-scale faults, with the largest one being oriented N145\u00b0E (Sausse et al., 2010). Between the top basement and 5000\u00a0m depth, several depth sections with variable fracture densities are observed (Fig. 7a). The hydraulic studies showed that there are 3 superimposed reservoirs in the granite: the upper one in the first 850\u00a0m of the granite (1400\u20132200\u00a0m MD), the middle one between 1550 and 2450\u00a0m (3000\u20133900\u00a0m MD) and the deepest one between 3650 and 3950\u00a0m (4000\u20135400\u00a0m MD) (Dezayes et al., 2010; Schill et al., 2017). In the first 500\u00a0m and from 1500 to 2000 m in the granite, the fracture density is higher (0.4\u20131.2 and 0.4\u20130.8 frac\/m respectively) corresponding to the upper and middle reservoirs. These 3 reservoirs are also reflected by the cumulative fracture thicknesses along the depth (Fig. 7). Hence, in GPK-3, we observe 3 plateaus, as follows: from 1530 to 2040 m MD, corresponding to the upper reservoir; from 3000 to 3200\u00a0m MD, corresponding to the top of the middle reservoir; and from 4350 to 5000\u00a0m MD, corresponding to the deepest reservoir (Fig. 9). The fracture spacings distribution in the EPS-1 well indicates a quite clustered spatial fracture network distribution in the upper reservoir, which could promote fracture connectivity and then higher permeability (Fig. 8). The most permeable FZ is located in the upper reservoir, i.e., in the GPK-2 well at 2120\u00a0m MD, which showed total mud losses during drilling operations (Sausse et al., 2010). Its injectivity index is 20\u00a0L\/s\/bar, which is three orders of magnitude higher than in the middle and deepest reservoirs (Schill et al., 2017). For example, the highest hydraulic yield before stimulation in the deepest reservoir observed in GPK-3 corresponds to the path of a local fault, which bears 70% of the flow (Dezayes et al., 2010).\nIndeed, at Illkirch, the local Eschau fault oriented N30\u00b0E at the borehole scale was intersected at the interface of the sedimentary cover and the granitic basement, but the permeable fractures are oriented NNW-SSE, which is quite different from the local fault orientation. The local fault was probably intersected in GIL-1 but does not present permeability evidence at the borehole scale, which may be due to the intense mineral clogging linked to paleo-circulations around this fault. The permeability seems more linked to the intra-granite fractures in the deepest part of the well (>3100\u00a0m MD), thus far away from this main faulted interface (2894\u00a0m MD). The permeability is lower in GIL-1 than in GRT-2, which is probably because the local normal fault zone intersected in GRT-2 exploits a first-order permeability that responds locally and rapidly. The Illkirch well is probably connected to a wide and regular network of small-scale fractures affecting the whole granitic batholith and corresponding to a distributed permeability. By considering a second geothermal well at the Illkirch site close to the first GIL-1 well, as there is no local intra-granite fault, the goal would be to maximize the connection between the intra-granite fractures and this future targeted well. As they are always the same inherited NNW-SSW to N\u2013S fractures that are encountered in the granitic basement, the well trajectory should favour a W-E direction with an inclination normal to the nearly vertical fractures planes, which means inclinations between 20 and 40\u00b0.\nThe geothermal experience in the Central URG reveals that the most permeable reservoir is located in the first 500\u20131000\u00a0m (TVD) of the granitic basement, which is characterized by high fracture densities and high fracture thicknesses. The trajectory of future wells should be optimized towards local intra-granite fault zones with deep dips. The inclination of the well should allow the intersection on the permeable fault zone over a greater length to maximize the connection between the well and the fracture network. The reservoir should present significant but not too important traces of fluid\/rock interactions, such as secondary clay minerals and geodic quartz. Inherited fault zones from the Variscan period, probably channelize the natural hydrothermal circulations and are ideal structural targets, particularly when they are intra-granite. The trajectory tangent to the fault zone, such as in the GRT-2 well, allowed a hydrothermal well to be obtained that did not need any stimulations and that produces 3.5\u00a0L\/s\/bar (Baujard et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn geothermal reservoirs of the Central URG, we have analysed the structural characteristics of fractured networks based on borehole images and extensive coring from 8 geothermal wells at 3 sites: Soultz-sous-For\u00eats, Rittershoffen and Illkirch.\n\n\u2022\nIn the three sites, the fractures follow the Rhenish direction (NNE-SSW) in the Buntsandstein sandstones and Muschelkalk limestones. In the granite, fractures strike NNW-SSE to N\u2013S following the late-Variscan inherited directions.\n\n\n\u2022\nFew permeable fractures were observed in the Triassic sediments. At Illkirch, the faulted interface between sandstone and granite is tight and does not present interesting permeability. In the granite, the permeable fractures intersected by the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats and Rittershoffen wells present a conjugate set striking N\u2013S, close to the Illkirch striking direction which is NNW-SSE. For all sites, all the permeable fractures are steeply dipping (85\u00b0E and W) and striking sub-parallelly to the maximum horizontal stress direction\u00b110\u00b0.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn the granitic basement, the fracture spacings distribution is governed by power laws and negative exponential laws, reflecting a clustered organization of the fractures. Hence, these closely spaced fractures define connected FZs, which are potential fluid pathways.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn the three sites, the fracture density and the fracture thickness are the greatest in the first 500\u20131000\u00a0m of the basement; this depth section is spatially correlated with the most permeable reservoirs. However, high fracture thickness and high fracture density are not systematically related to high permeabilities. In fact, the permeability depends mainly of the connectivity of the fractures and requires a good equilibrium between the dissolution and precipitation processes to preserve the natural fluid channels.\n\n\n\nThe structural inheritance predisposes the organization of fractures in the reservoir and governs the hydrothermal inheritance. The permeability is mainly controlled by nearly vertical fracture networks intersecting both the Triassic sandstone and the crystalline Palaeozoic basement. In the Central URG, the most promising target is to intersect and run tangent to highly dipping local normal faults intra-top granite.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nCarole Glaas: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Investigation, Data curation, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 original draft, Visualization.

Accurate knowledge of rock-mechanical properties and in-situ stress distribution is necessary to assess fault slip potentiality and induced seismicity, achieve ideal wellbore placement to ensure wellbore stability and formation integrity, optimized perforation orientation, hydraulic fracturing, completion design and hence field production (Morris et al., 1996; Addis, 1997; Hettema et al., 1998, 2000; Streit and Hillis, 2004; Safari et al., 2013; Figueiredo et al., 2015; Segall and Lu, 2015; Kim and Hosseini 2016; Liang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019; Baouche et al., 2020b; Abdelghany et al., 2021; Radwan et al., 2021d).\nThis work focuses on the El Morgan oil field, which is one of the largest hydrocarbon fields in the Gulf of Suez Basin, Egypt (EGPC, 1996; Radwan, 2021b; Radwan et al., 2019b, c, d; Radwan et al., 2021b). Due to elevated production from the high permeability Miocene sandstone reservoirs, the formation pressure reduced rapidly. The operator had opted for a waterflooding strategy at the early field stage (in the year 1974) with a very high water injection rate of >50000 BWIPD (barrel water injected per day) (Noureldien and Nabil, 2016; Radwan et al., 2021b). Even after that, newly acquired 3D seismic aided continued exploration and appraisal activities added more than 37 MMBO (million barrels of oil) recoverable hydrocarbons from the unexplored structural segments and unexploited sandstone intervals of the 30-year-old El Morgan oil field in late 1997 (Hughes et al., 1997), which was followed by aggressive developmental drilling campaign. Production and reservoir management of this giant oil field possess significant challenges in terms of reservoir stability and faulting potential. The rate of depletion directly affects the minimum (\u03c3hmin) and maximum horizontal stress (\u03c3hmax) magnitude against the producing intervals (Chan and Zoback, 2002; Soltanzadeh and Hawkes, 2007; Radwan and Sen, 2021; Kassem et al., 2021b), however \u03c3hmax and pore pressure coupling possesses difficulties in actual measurements (Altmann et al., 2010). If the rate of change of pore pressure vs. \u03c3hmin exceeds a critical value, depletion-induced faulting can introduce significant reservoir instability and seismicity (Addis, 1997; Haug et al., 2018; Koughnet et al., 2018). Another aspect of the challenge is with the optimization of the infill injector well deliveries, which includes the drilling as well as a fluid injection for enhanced recoveries. Depletion alters the effective downhole drilling mud window; accordingly casing and mud design have to be revised in the matured reservoirs. Also, the rate of fluid injection should not exceed the critical limit which can result in existing fault slippage at the depleted reservoir intervals during repressurization process (Fang and Khaskar, 2010; Vidal-Gilbert et al., 2010; Safari et al., 2013; Figueiredo et al., 2015; Kim and Hosseini 2016; Taghipour et al., 2019). This study addresses these key aspects of reservoir management utilizing a well-based geomechanical workflow. Based on the direct formation measurements and well logs, pore pressure and in-situ stress profiles were established both for the virgin (initial) as well as depleted (present-day) conditions. Rock elastic properties and the pore pressure change are integrated to ascertain the \u03c3hmin behavior in response to depletion as well as the reservoir stress path. A critical formation pore pressure limit has been modeled to identify maximum allowable pressure increase during repressurization. The study infers critical insights on the pore pressure-Shmin coupling behavior in the depleted Miocene reservoirs and will assist the operator to optimize the waterflood planning and infill injector drilling. The same is equally significant for underground gas storage (UGS) and possible CO2 sequestration applications as well.\n\n\n2\nGeological settings\nThe Gulf of Suez is an extensively studied failed rift basin situated at the northern arm of the triple junction that is made with the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (Moustafa, 1976; Al Sharhan, 2003; Wescott et al., 2016; Kassem et al., 2021a, b; Radwan et al., 2021a, b, c, d). The northwestern arm of the Red Sea was formed due to the rupturing of the continental lithosphere associated with the upwelling from asthenosphere (Jackson et al., 1988; Radwan et al., 2021d). A tectonic map of the region is presented in Fig. 1\n, which indicates the presence of three principal major faults, shear zones, strata dip direction, and accommodation zones: Darag Basin in the north, Belayim Province in the central part and Zeit Province in the south (Bosworth and Mcclay, 2001; El Diasty et al., 2020; Radwan et al., 2020b). The basin is characterized by NNW trending extensional faults and hosts numerous producing hydrocarbon fields. The studied El Morgan field is situated between 28\u00b005\u2032-28\u00b033\u2032 N and 33\u00b017\u2032 to33\u00b030\u2032 E and covers approximately 46\u00a0km2 area. A location map of the study area is presented in Fig. 2\n. A large N\u2013S trending large eastern basement fault separates this field from the neighboring Badri field (Radwan, 2021a, 2021b). Regional lithostratigraphy of the studied field is presented in Table 1\n. The drilled wells encountered around 7000\u20137300 feet thick Cenozoic succession, comprising of post-rift Pliocene-Pleistocene units and syn-rift Miocene sediments. It consists of two principal clastic reservoir intervals \u2013 Middle Miocene Hammam Faraun and Kareem Formations, which were separated by the anhydrite bearing Feiran-Baba Formations. Similar to the neighboring Badri field, the reservoir facies is represented by multistory coastal fan deltaic sandstones (Attia et al., 2015; Radwan, 2021a) along with shale intercalations, deposited during the Gulf of Suez rifting phase (Abudeif et al., 2016a, b; Radwan et al., 2019b). These reservoirs have around 10\u201326% porosity and 50\u20133000 mD permeabilities (Abudeif et al., 2018; Noureldien and Nabil, 2016). Thick anhydrite deposits of the Upper Miocene South Gharib Formation provide the sealing to the mentioned hydrocarbon reservoirs (Al Sharhan, 2003; Peijs et al., 2012; Rohais et al., 2016; Radwan, 2020a, b, c).\n\n\n3\nMaterial and methods\nAll the wells drilled in the El Morgan field display similar lithostratigraphic sections from seabed to the Middle Miocene targets with little difference in formation thickness. The studied wells were drilled in 115\u2013200 feet of water depth and covered around 7300 feet of the Cenozoic stratigraphy. These wells targeted the hydrocarbon production from two principal clastic reservoirs: Hammam Faraun and Kareem Formations. Based on the log data coverage in the entire well as well as the availability of direct downhole measurements, we have carefully chosen two wells, namely A-1 and D-1 for the geomechanical analysis presented here. Wireline logs consisting of gamma ray, resistivity, bulk-density, compressional and shear sonic slowness covering almost the entire stratigraphic succession were recorded in these two wells and the same had been the primary inputs for the geomechanical assessment. A well log-based lithostratigraphic correlation is presented in Fig. 3\n using the two studied wells.\nOne of the contributing well-selection criteria was the availability of the formation pressure measurements both in virgin pre-production condition as well as present-day depleted condition, which these two wells satisfied. This was the primary necessity to quantify the reservoir pore pressure drop as a result of production induced depletion. Formation pressure measurements were taken from the wells drilled at various phases of field development. Drilling data (mud weight, leak-off tests, formation integrity test etc.), and well reports (geological summary, well completion reports etc.) were studied and used in this work. Applied methods are discussed below.\n\n3.1\nPore pressure (PP) magnitude\nPore fluid trapped in the formation porosities greatly affect the in-situ stress magnitudes. Abnormal formation pressure yields increased complexity in drilling and non-productive times. Direct downhole measurements provide the best PP estimates; however, these data are usually recorded only in the reservoir intervals (Sen et al., 2019, 2020; Agbasi et al., 2021; Radwan, 2021b). Direct pressure data were recorded by the wireline Repeat Formation Tester (RFT) tool in the Middle Miocene Hammam Faraun and Kareem sandstone reservoirs. These measurements were available from both the virgin conditions as well as depleted conditions, which were interpreted to quantify the drop of reservoir pore pressure as a result of prolonged production. The Pleistocene-Upper Miocene overburden stratigraphy is dominated by halite and anhydrite; therefore, a compaction trendline-based method could not be utilized in the study area. Drilling mud weight is employed as a proxy considering downhole fluid pressure overbalance to prevent fluid influxes during drilling (Radwan et al., 2019a, 2020b).\n\n\n3.2\nVertical stress (\u03c3v) and minimum horizontal stress (\u03c3hmin)\nBeing situated in the active normal faulting tectonic settings, vertical stress (\u03c3v) and minimum horizontal stress (\u03c3hmin) are the highest and least principal stress components in the studied El Morgan oil field. Vertical stress is the amount of pressure resulting from the litho-column above and it can be estimated by the equation below (Plumb et al., 1991):\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c3v\n=\n\n\n\u222b\n\n0\nZ\n\nRHOB\n\n(\nZ\n)\n\n\u2217g\u00a0dZ\n\n\n\nwhere \n\ng\n\n is the gravitational acceleration (9.8\u00a0m\/s2). RHOB indicates the wireline bulk-density reading available from the studied wells. Density logs, being sensitive to the formation lithology, reflects the variation in vertical stress gradient throughout the stratigraphy. A considerable thickness of the Upper Miocene Zeit and South Gharib Formations consists of halite and anhydrite respectively, which possess contrasting density values of about 2.1 and 2.9\u00a0g\/cc. The Middle Miocene is dominated by clastic deposits of around 2.6\u00a0g\/cc. Necessary environmental corrections and processing were performed on the recorded bulk-density logs before utilizing those into vertical stress estimation.\nFor the estimation of \u03c3hmin, we have employed two approaches. The first approach utilizes the uniaxial strain model to estimate the \u03c3hmin magnitude (Eaton, 1968; Zhang and Zhang, 2017):\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03c3hmin\n=\n\nn\n\n1\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c3v\n\u2212\n\u03b1PP\n\n)\n\n+\n\u03b1PP\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03b1\n\n is the Biot's coefficient, usually varies between 0.85 and 1 (Bouteca et al., 1994; Hettema et al., 1998). In the absence of core-based bulk modulus measurements, we have assumed \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a01 (Zoback, 2007). \u028b is the static Poisson's ratio, which can be calculated from P and S wave velocities (Vp and Vs, respectively):\n\n(3)\n\n\nn\n=\n\n\n\nVp\n2\n\n\u2212\n2\n\nVs\n2\n\n\n\n2\n\n(\n\n\nVp\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nVs\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model requires the rock elastic parameter (Poisson's ratio) in the calculation and hence reflects the variation of minimum in-situ stress magnitude with varying lithology. The second model uses the effective stress ratio coefficient to calculate Shmin magnitude, as proposed by Mathews and Kelly (1967):\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u03c3hmin\n=\nPP\n+\nK\u00a0\n\n(\n\u03c3v\n\u2212\nPP\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere, K is known as the effective stress ratio coefficient and calculated from leak-off test (LOT) data by the following equation:\n\n(5)\n\n\nK\n=\n\n\nLOT\n\u2212\nPP\n\n\n\u03c3v\n\u2212\nPP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nEffect of reservoir depletion on PP and \u03c3hmin\nAs a result of hydrocarbon production, reservoir pore pressure decreases, which also changes the in-situ stress magnitudes. These changes affect near-wellbore regions immediately and propagate to the far-field with prolonged production induced depletion (Addis, 1997). Following Hooke's Law, assuming an elastic response, the relationship between the stress and strain is expressed as:\n\n(6)\n\n\nn\u03c3hmin\n=\n\n1\nE\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c3hmin\n\u2212\n\u00a0n\u00a0\n\n(\n\n\u03c3hmax\n+\n\u03c3v\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b1t T\n\n\n\nwhere, \n\nn\u03c3hmin\n\n is the strain component parallel to the \u03c3hmin orientation; E\u00a0=\u00a0Young's modulus; \u03c3hmin-\u03c3hmax and \u03c3v are the principal stress components and \n\n\u2032\n\u03b1t T\u2032\n\n denotes the thermal expansion coefficient. Maximum horizontal stress and pore pressure coupling is anticipated but it possesses difficulties in actual measurements (Altmann et al., 2010), therefore in this study, we focused only on the effect of Shmin changes (\u0394\u03c3hmin) in response to depletion (\u0394PP). It can be mathematically expressed as (Geertsma, 1966):\n\n(7)\n\n\n\u0394n\u03c3hmin\n=\n\n1\nE\n\n\n(\n\n\u0394\u03c3hmin\n\u2212\n\u00a0n\u00a0\n\n(\n\n\u0394\u03c3hmax\n+\n\u0394\u03c3v\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\nn\n\nE\n\n)\n\n\u03b1 \u0394PP\n\u2212\n\n\u03b1t \u0394T\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering a greater lateral extent vs. vertical thickness ratio, the possibility of lateral compaction is nullified (\n\n\u0394n\u03c3hmin\n=\n0\n\n) (Segall and Fitzgerald 1996; Santarelli et al., 1998; Goulty, 2003; Segura et al., 2011). Therefore Eq. (7) can be rearranged as:\n\n(8)\n\n\n\u0394\u03c3hmin\n=\n\n(\n\nn\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\u0394\u03c3v\n+\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\nn\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\u03b1 \u0394PP\n+\n\n(\n\nE\n\n1\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u03b1t \u0394T\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of pure uniaxial compaction (\n\n\u0394\u03c3v\n=\n0\n\n), \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a01, and unchanged reservoir temperature (\n\n\u0394T\n=\n0\n\n) (Zoback, 2007), Eq. (8) can be rewritten as:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\u0394\u03c3hmin\n=\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\nn\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\u0394PP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n(\n\n\u0394\u03c3hmin\n\u0394PP\n\n)\n\n=\nA\n=\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\nn\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u2018A\u2019 is termed as stress path. Pore pressure depletion is quantified from the direct measurements of virgin reservoir pressure and the same in the depleted stage by RFT tool, as discussed in section 3.1. Log-based Poisson's ratio values (Eq. (3)) were used to model \u0394\u03c3hmin and stress path in the target reservoir intervals in the studied El Morgan oil field.\n\n\n3.4\nStability of depleted reservoir\nIn a normal faulting tectonic regime (following the frictional faulting theory), the Coulomb failure criterion can be expressed as:\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3v\n\u2212\nPP\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c3hmin\n\u2212\n\u00a0PP\n\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\nv\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\nhmin\n\n\n=\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n2\n\n+\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\u03bc\n\n]\n\n2\n\n=\nf\n\n(\n\u03bc\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere, \u2018\u03bc\u2019 denotes the coefficient of internal friction.

(15), a normal faulting stress path limit is found to be 0.68. This deciphers that if a stress path value of a producing interval exceeds this critical limit (A>0.68), production can induce normal faulting within the reservoir, thus making it unstable (Chan and Zoback, 2002; Zoback and Zinke 2002). A<0.68 is considered to be a stable stress path value.\n\n\n3.5\nFault slip analysis during re-pressurization\nFault slip potential is an important aspect of reservoir geomechanical stability analysis. It is a common practice to pressurize a depleted reservoir by injecting water to maintain a planned production in the Gulf of Suez fields. During the waterflooding process, pore pressure increases and thus effective normal stress decreases. This can eventually create slippage on existing faults or weak fracture planes if the pore pressure build up by fluid injection exceeds a critical pressure threshold (PPc) (Safari et al., 2013; Figueiredo et al., 2015). In a normal faulting tectonic regime, assuming cohesion\u00a0=\u00a00 and \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.6, the critical pore pressure threshold for shear slippage on optimally oriented cohesionless faults is as follows (Taghipour et al., 2019):\n\n(16)\n\n\nPPc\n=\n\n\n3\n\n\u03c3hmin\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3v\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEq. (16) assumes the total stress field is unaffected by the fluid injection and the assumption of zero cohesion on faults provides a very conservative pressure threshold estimate. However, considering pore pressure-stress coupling during fluid injection, researchers have proposed the terminal values of stress vs pore pressure perturbation ratio along the radial and tangential directions as (Altmann et al., 2010; Vidal-Gilbert et al., 2010; Kim and Hosseini 2016):\n\n(17)\n\n\nRadial\u00a0change\n:\n\n(\n\n\nn\n\n\u03c3\nRadial\n\n\n\u0394PP\n\n)\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\nn\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(18)\n\n\nTangential\u00a0change\n:\n\n(\n\n\nn\n\n\u03c3\nTangential\n\n\n\u0394PP\n\n)\n\n=\n0.5\n\u03c3\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\nn\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVilarrasa et al. (2013) interpreted that the \u03c3v changes negligibly in the middle part of the injection zone. However, \u0394\u03c3v has greater effects at the upper reservoir-caprock interface due to the surplus pore pressure build-up at the initial injection phase because the injected fluid flow into the impermeable caprock is restricted due to the permeability contrast. Kim and Hosseini (2016) also confirms the similar observation in their analytical modeling. The revised effective vertical stress (\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\u2032\n\n\n) due to PP-\u03c3v coupling can be stated as:\n\n(19)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n(\n\u03c3v\n+\n\n\u03b2\nv\n\n\u00a0nPP\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nPP\n0\n\n+\nn\nPP\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere, \n\n\n\u03b2\nv\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\u0394\u03c3v\n\u0394PP\n\n)\n\n\n, \n\n\nPP\n0\n\n\n is the latest reservoir pore pressure at present-day depletion and \n\n\u0394\nPP\n\n is the pore pressure increase by fluid injection. Similarly, a PP-\u03c3hmin coupling modified the effective minimum horizontal stress (\n\n\n\u03c3\nhmin\n\u2032\n\n\n) as:\n\n(20)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nhmin\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n(\n\u03c3hmin\n+\n\n\u03b2\nh\n\n\u00a0nPP\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nPP\n0\n\n+\nn\nPP\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere, \n\n\n\u03b2\nh\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\u0394\u03c3hmin\n\u0394PP\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe have analyzed various coupling situations to assess critical pore pressure build ups for fault slippage. We have plotted the Mohr circles with different \n\n\n\u03b2\nh\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b2\nv\n\n\n conditions to interpret the maximum allowable pressure that the depleted reservoir can sustain during the waterflood injection.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPore pressure and in-situ stresses in virgin condition\nDensity log-derived vertical stress provides an average gradient of 22.93\u00a0MPa\/km (using Eq. (1)) in the Pleistocene-Miocene stratigraphy of the El Morgan oil field. However, a formation specific investigation reveals a relatively lower \u03c3v gradient (21.45\u00a0MPa\/km) in the halite bearing South Gharib Formation, which is affected by lower halite density of 2.1\u00a0gm\/cc (Fig. 4\n). A higher \u03c3v gradient (24.17\u201328.12\u00a0MPa\/km) was observed against the Zeit, Feiran and Baba Formations (Table 2\n) due to the presence of Anhydrites (>2.9\u00a0gm\/cc) (Fig. 4). The principal clastic reservoirs of the Hammam Faraun and Kareen Formations have an average density of 2.6\u00a0gm\/cc, which contributed to an \u03c3v range of 22.78\u201323.17\u00a0MPa\/km (Table 2).\nThe virgin pore pressure against the reservoir sections (Hammam Faraun and Kareem Formations) are interpreted from the extensively available downhole RFT measurements (Fig. 4). Both the reservoirs display slightly higher than the hydrostatic pressure regime in the virgin condition (11.10\u201311.25\u00a0MPa\/km), however the Hammam Faraun reservoir pressure was more than the Kareen reservoirs (Table 2). The non-reservoir intervals are dominated by halite and anhydrite along with thin shale intercalations. Based on the mud overbalance proxy, we finalized the pore pressure in those intervals. Halite, due to its plastic nature, was drilled with the highest mud weight and the same has been assumed as the South Gharib Formation pressure gradient (Fig. 4).\n\u03c3hmin estimates of both the models (Eqs. (2) and (4)) provided very similar gradient ranges across the encountered stratigraphy (Fig. 4). Estimated \u03c3hmin was calibrated with the measured LOT values available at the bottom of the South Gharib Formation. FIT data recorded at the Lower Zeit and South Gharib Formations could not be used for \u03c3hmin validation, however these values indicated that the formation could withstand that amount of downhole pressure while drilling without causing fluid loss. A higher interpreted pore pressure gradient as well as LOT-based effective stress ratio provided a higher \u03c3hmin gradient within the South Gharib Formation (18.93\u201319.62\u00a0MPa\/km). Both the reservoir intervals exhibited a close \u03c3hmin range of 15.88\u201316.65\u00a0MPa\/km in the virgin condition (Table 2). In absence of core-based measurements, we have utilized two different values of Biot's coefficient as 0.85 and 1 to estimate \u03c3hmin by Model 1 (Eq. (2)). A higher Biot's coefficient value provided higher \u03c3hmin magnitude and a maximum difference of 2.4\u00a0MPa is recorded in the \u03c3hmin magnitude against the target reservoirs. Model 2 can be considered a higher \u03c3hmin estimate (derived from Eq. (4)), while the dynamic Poisson's ratio-based Model 1 depicts the lithological variability in the \u03c3hmin estimation in a better way. Therefore, it has been used in further analysis of the depletion effect in subsurface stress analysis and reservoir stability. Being in a normal faulting tectonic setup, the maximum horizontal stress magnitude can be safely assumed between the \u03c3hmin higher estimate (Model 2) and \u03c3v. Fig. 4 presents the interpreted pore pressure and stresses of the virgin reservoirs in the El Morgan oil field, while the mean gradients are documented in Table 2.\n\n\n4.2\nEffect of depletion on PP and \u03c3hmin\nRFT measurements in the depleted reservoirs were used to interpret the drop in reservoir pore pressure as an effect of continued hydrocarbon production from the multistoried sandstones. The latest measurements indicate an around 6\u20136.5\u00a0MPa pressure drop in the Hammam Faraun reservoirs, while the Kareem sandstones are more depleted. A more heterogeneous pore pressure drop is noted in the Kareem Formation with \u0394PP of around 8\u20139.5\u00a0MPa in the Upper Kareem sands and 10\u201311.75\u00a0MPa in the lower sands, respectively. This behavior is found in all the studied wells (Figs. 5\u20136\n\n) and probably because of uneven drawdown from the stacked sandstones across the vertical permeability barriers as posed by the shales. This observation correlates well with the findings by Bentley and Biller (1990), who reported two vertically distinct performance and permeability compartments within the Kareem Formation (Upper and Lower) and reported more lateral continuity in the Lower Kareem. Based on the quantified \u0394PP and log-derived Poisson's ratio, we have estimated the \u03c3hmin profiles against the depleted intervals (Figs. 5\u20136). Results indicate \u0394\u03c3hmin of around 3.3\u20134\u00a0MPa in the Hammam Faraun and 5\u20138\u00a0MPa in the Kareem Formation (Fig. 7\n). These results directly affect the future drilling planning. In the depleted reservoirs, especially in the Middle Miocene Kareem Formation, mud weight must be lowered to hydrostatic or below that to avoid any fluid loss during the infill injector well drilling (Figs. 5\u20136).\n\n\n4.3\nReservoir stability during depletion\nBased on the \u0394PP and \u0394\u03c3hmin, stress path values are generated in the producing reservoirs. The Hammam Faraun and Kareem reservoirs have an average stress path value ranging between 0.56-0.61 and 0.63\u20130.66, respectively (Fig. 7). Now, considering the normal faulting stress path limit value of 0.68, production induced normal faulting is unlikely in the Hammam Faraun reservoir (Fig. 8\na). However, the stress path value (=0.66) of the Lower Kareem sands is very close to the critical faulting limit\/unstable stress path (Figs. 7 and 8b). A continued drawdown with a higher depletion rate might potentially introduce normal faulting within the lower part of the reservoir. Mohr circles corresponding to the virgin, present-day depleted stages are plotted in Fig. 8c and d along with the further depletion stage to induce reservoir faulting. The corresponding Mohr circles indicate that the Hamman Faraun reservoir, at present-day depletion stage, has much more depletion window before inducing instabilities.\n\n\n4.4\nFault slip due to repressurization\nWe analyzed the effect of fluid injection and repressurization in both the depleted reservoir intervals to understand the critical pore pressure limit that can introduce the shear slippage on optimally oriented faults or weak planes at the reservoir levels. For failure limit, a linearized Mohr envelope considers the internal friction coefficient value of 0.6 and zero cohesion on the fault planes. The first approach was a conservative one which assumes the total stress field is unaffected by repressurization process. The results are presented in Fig. 9\n. The analysis reveals that a pore pressure increment in the range of 2.7\u20132.9\u00a0MPa can shift the Mohr circle to the failure line at the Hammam Faraun reservoir level at present condition. The required \u0394PP varies between a close range for the entire Hammam Faraun Formation. A much less of pore pressure increment window is observed in the Kareem Formation, ranging between 2.2 and 1.4\u00a0MPa (Fig. 9). The highly depleted Lower Kareem sandstones have the lowest critical pore pressure tolerance to induce fault slip by fluid injection.\nIn the second approach, we considered pore pressure-stress coupling as a result of fluid injection. Three possible coupling scenarios were investigated assuming zero cohesion on the pre-existing faults and fractures:\n\ni)\nboth \u03c3v and \u03c3hmin changes with a similar ratio of 0.5 (\u03b2v\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b2h\u00a0=\u00a00.5) in response to fluid injection.\n\n\nii)\n\u03c3hmin coupling with \u0394PP during the injection. Considering \u028b\u00a0=\u00a00.25 in Eq. (17), \u03b2h\u00a0=\u00a00.66. \u03c3v remain unaffected (\u0394\u03c3v\u00a0=\u00a00, in Eq. (18)), hence \u03b2v\u00a0=\u00a00.\n\n\niii)\nBoth \u03c3v and \u03c3hmin are affected by \u0394PP during the injection. With the same Poisson's ratio value, Eq. (17-18) yields \u03b2h\u00a0=\u00a00.66 and \u03b2v\u00a0=\u00a00.33.\n\n\n\nWe have run this analysis for both the Hammam Faraun and Kareem (Lower part) reservoirs at 5900\u00a0ft and 7150\u00a0ft, respectively. Results are presented in Fig. 10\n. Coupling with \u03b2v\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b2h\u00a0=\u00a00.5 provides a critical pore pressure limit of 18.83\u00a0MPa (Fig. 10a). PP-\u03c3hmin coupling leads a 7.75\u00a0MPa pressurization window (Fig. 10b) and PP-\u03c3v-\u03c3hmin coupling situation increases the window to 10\u00a0MPa (Fig. 10c). Highly depleted Lower Kareem reservoir has a depletion stress path very close it its depletion induced faulting limit, as we have presented in Fig. 8. And expectedly it also provides a lesser repressurization window. Maximum \u0394PP limit at 7150\u00a0ft is interpreted 3.1\u20138\u00a0MPa (Fig. 10c\u2013e) in the three coupling situations. Overall, the Kareem Formation, at the present depletion level, is found to be more vulnerable to the production induced reservoir instability due to the lesser repressurization window before inducing fault slippage.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussions\n\n5.1\nMaximum allowable depletion before reservoir faulting\nWe compared the interpreted stress paths with the recent results from the neighboring Badri field in the east, reported by Radwan and Sen (2021). The same reservoir intervals had much stable path values (ranging between 0.54 and 0.59) in the Badri field. It is to be noted that these two fields are separated by large normal faults and reservoirs are compartmentalized regionally. A prolonged production (primary and secondary recovery) from more laterally extensive Miocene reservoirs of the giant EL Morgan field results in much more depletion magnitude, which reflects in their corresponding stress path values. A global compilation of depleted reservoirs\u2019 stress path values is presented in Table 3\n. The studied reservoir behaves very similarly to the southern North Sea (Fang and Khaskar, 2010) and Wytch farm reservoirs (Addis, 1997).\nMaximum allowable reservoir depletion before secondary recovery (i.e., water injection in this case) is mostly governed by the hydrocarbon production volume, water cut percentage and therefore project economics, as seems justified and appropriate by the operator to continue the production. However, the technically allowable maximum depletion limit can be governed by the geomechanical stability of the producing formation. The operator had initiated the water injection at a very early stage of the field production, even before the further discoveries from unexplored parts of the field which was followed by a massive development drilling campaign. We intended to comprehend the allowable depletion magnitude at present-day reservoir PP condition if water injection is ceased indefinitely. From the Mohr circles plotted in Fig. 8c and d, Hammam Faraun (at 5900\u00a0ft level) and Kareem (at 7150\u00a0ft level) reservoirs can have the lowest depleted pore pressure magnitudes of 4.2\u00a0MPa and 3.5\u00a0MPa, respectively which will enable the depletion Mohr circle to touch the conservative linearized Mohr-Coulomb failure line. At present-day PP of 13.33\u00a0MPa and 12.31\u00a0MPa, these two reservoirs have a further technical depletion window of 9.14\u00a0MPa and 8.81\u00a0MPa before inducing normal faulting (Fig. 8). However, if a higher drawdown rate is implemented, that will quickly increase the stress path value (\n\n\n\u0394\u03c3hmin\n\u0394PP\n\n\n) and it can exceed its critical faulting limit faster.\nDepletion is associated with reservoir compaction and therefore land subsidence. These data are usually scarce but critically important to infer the environmental impact and assess the reservoir performance due to long-term production. In-situ reservoir compaction can be measured by radioactive markers, borehole extensometer etc. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), continuous GPS (CGPS) measurements, global positioning system (GPS) surveying, and spirit-levelling surveying can be helpful to monitor and measure the land subsidence. These have been found effective in characterizing depleted reservoirs and land subsidence in North Sea and USA; but have never been acquired in any of the Egyptian hydrocarbon fields. We recommend gathering these datasets to classify flags and alerts regarding the depletion behavior and to model the reservoir compaction.\n\n\n5.2\nMaximum allowable injection and caprock integrity\nCritical pore pressure threshold, i.e., the fluid injection limit of the two studied reservoirs were presented in Fig. 10. The PP-\u03c3hmin coupling assumption (\u03b2h\u00a0=\u00a00.66 and \u03b2v\u00a0=\u00a00) in uniaxial condition (\u0394\u03c3v\u00a0=\u00a00) (Fig. 10b, e) employed in the injection-induced fault slip analysis is geomechanically similar to the one used for depletion stress path. Results indicate a higher repressurization window in a PP-\u03c3v-\u03c3hmin coupling situation for both the reservoirs. It is absolutely critical to assess the effect of repressurization in the seal\/caprock integrity. If the reservoir pressure build up overcomes the minimum horizontal stress and tensile strength (\u03c3hmin\u00a0+\u00a0Tensile strength) of the caprock, it can be hydraulically fractured, and the vertical seal may be lost (Fang and Khaskar 2013). Due to the lack of laboratory measured tensile strength, tensile strength is assumed to be negligible. We reviewed the \u03c3hmin of the South Gharib and Baba Formations (anhydrite dominated, with minor shale), which act as the caprocks for the Hammam Faraun and Kareem reservoirs, respectively. The critical pore pressure limit by fluid injection (PPc) in the Hammam Faraun was estimated as 23.33\u00a0MPa, considering PP-\u03c3v-\u03c3hmin coupling, which is the most likely applicable at reservoir-caprock interface. This threshold is still 5\u00a0MPa lower than the \u03c3hmin at the base of the South Gharib caprock (28.33\u00a0MPa at 5687\u00a0ft TVD) (Fig. 11\n) and can ensure sufficient seal integrity. Similarly, the maximum allowable PPc of 20.31\u00a0MPa in the Kareem reservoir is comfortably lower than the \u03c3hmin at Baba Formation's base (29.87\u00a0MPa at 6430\u00a0ft TVD). We conclude that the modeled repressurization window is unlikely to induce any geomechanical integrity issues within the respective caprocks.\n\n\n5.3\nEffect of \u2018\u03bc\u2019 on fault slip potential\nFriction on faults has critical implications on its shear slippage potential. Previous studies indicate that the seismically active faults are relatively strong structures where frictional coefficient (\u03bc) varies within a close range of 0.6\u20130.85 (Byerlee, 1978; Scholz, 2000). Byerlee (1978) also indicated that in situations of higher effective normal stress (>10\u00a0MPa), friction of faults in independent of surface roughness, rate of slip and normal stresses and therefore \u03bc is restricted in such a small window (Zoback, 2007). A higher \u03bc of 0.7 is reported from the stress measurements at KTB deep scientific borehole, Germany (Zoback and Harjes, 1997). However, the presence of clay minerals can reduce the make the faults extremely weak (Carpenter et al., 2011). From field-based studies in Central Italy, Collettini et al. (2009, 2011) reported very weak fault horizons with frictional coefficient value as low as 0.25. Ikari et al. (2009) measured the frictional properties of clay rich fault gouges and indicated that montmorillonite gouge (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.19\u20130.23) is consistently weaker than the illite and chlorite gouges (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.27\u20130.32).\nWe intended to quantify the effect of varying fault friction on its stability due to pressurization at the reservoir level. For this, we have considered the regional \u03c3hmin orientation of the Gulf of Suez Basin as N15\u00b0E, as inferred by Bosworth and Durocher (2017) from their studies on compressive and tensile wellbore failures in exploratory wells. Our analyses on injection-induced fault slip indicates minimum repressurization window (\u0394PP) is available when the pore pressure-stress coupling is not considered. The assumption of total stress field remaining unchanged while fluid injection provided a very conservative \u0394PP at reservoir level. Assuming the same scenario at Hammam Faraun reservoir level at the depth of 5900 feet, the fault slippage potential at various \u03bc values are presented in Fig. 12\n. Considering a stronger fault with \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.85, a much higher fluid injection window is achieved, where the most optimally oriented fault\/fracture (around N80\u00b0E) provides the lowest \u0394PP of 5.63\u00a0MPa, while none of the faults seem to be critically stressed (Fig. 12 a-b). The results with \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0at the 5900\u00a0ft depth is previously presented at Fig. 9b. With lowered fault frictional strength at \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.4, the faults striking between N55\u00b0E and N80\u00b0E are seen to be critically stressed and are likely to fail and do not offer any \u0394PP window at such situations (Fig. 12 c-d). With \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.25, majority of the fault orientations comes under the critically stressed category (Figure e\u2013f). The studied area has predominantly NW-SE oriented bounding normal faults which provided the effective hydrocarbon trapping and considered to be completely sealing with higher \u03bc. However, the minor NE-SW faults at the reservoir level might be vulnerable to injection-induced shear slippage if those have higher clay contents.\n\n\n5.4\nPossible uncertainties in interpretation\n\u03c3hmin against the reservoirs are a derived from log-based dynamic Poisson's ratio assuming zero lateral strain and can be argued to be overestimated since static Poisson's ratio is not utilized. The literature study covering various lithologies belonging to wide geological ages in worldwide basins reveals that dynamic and static Poisson's ratio have almost the same values and therefore it is not expected to contribute much error in the \u03c3hmin output. The best technical practice will be to directly measure fracture closure pressure within the two reservoir intervals (by mini-frac test etc.) and use those to validate\/calibrate the stress profile to achieve a more confident output.\nIt is noteworthy that due to the unavailability of core-based measurements we have assumed Biot's coefficient (\u03b1)\u00a0=\u00a01 and \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.6, which introduces some uncertainties in our results. We tried to infer the effect of varying \u03bc on fault slip potential in the previous section. The Biot's coefficient value has critical effects in the magnitudes of horizontal in-situ stresses and effective stresses that governs the rock-mechanical response to the stress and pore pressure variations (Belkhatir et al., 2013). Luo et al. (2015) discussed various approaches to estimate \u03b1 from well logs, but requires core-based validations, which are expensive and laborious. We utilized two different values of Biot's coefficient as 0.85 and 1 as a suggested range by various researchers (Bouteca et al., 1994; Hettema et al., 1998). The resultant \u03c3hmin (by Model 1) was lowered by maximum 2.4\u00a0MPa at the Kareem reservoir level in the Well D-1 at virgin condition (Fig. 4). To infer the effect of varying \u03b1 on fault slip potential by fluid injection, we chose the Lower Kareem interval of the Well A-1, which offers the maximum depletion magnitude. Results are presented in Fig. 13\n. With \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a01, a maximum allowable pore pressure increment of 1.65\u00a0MPa is inferred in the depleted Kareem level of the Well A-1 (Fig. 13a). However, with \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.85, the representative Mohr circle at present-day depleted condition touches the conservative Mohr failure envelope (cohesion\u00a0=\u00a00, \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.6) and does not leave any fluid injection opportunity. We believe that the results are extreme in the Kareem reservoir since the same is maximum depleted with a depletion stress path very close to the normal faulting limit (A\u00a0=\u00a00.66, Fig. 6b). Summarily, Biot's coefficient is critical in the depletion and injection geomechanical assessment and can be very tricky in absence of core-based validations.\nIn this study, we followed the concept of fluid injection-induced decrease of effective normal stresses, which can promote the shear slippage along the optimally oriented faults and weak planes present within the target reservoir level. The fault slip potential might not be such a straightforward case always, as Scuderi and Collettini (2016) indicated that the rate and state friction parameters as well as fault rheological stiffness can also change with increasing pore fluid pressure by fluid injection. Seismic potential of the faults due to fluid injection can also be influenced by the stress re-distribution (Miller et al., 2004; Segall and Lu, 2015) and weakening effects during fault slip (Ikari et al., 2013). However, such analyses require direct laboratory-based measurements of the fault gouge materials to understand their mechanical and frictional behavior. These data can be collected from surface exposures of the faults by geological fieldwork. The sampling of fault gouges is scarce, rather practically rare from the oil and gas fields which deals with the deep seated subsurface faults visible in seismic data. The same was experienced in the studied El Morgan field, however the fault mechanical properties remain a critical contributor in the fault slip evaluation aspects.\nThe maximum depletion and fluid injection thresholds to avoid reservoir instability were assessed assuming cohesive strength as zero. This yields a conservative estimate but underestimates the critical pressure values for reservoir stability. Rock cohesive strength can be measured from cores which will shift the linearized Mohr failure envelope along the shear stress axis and thus increases the pressure drop\/build-up window. Zoback and Zinke (2002) suggested that reservoirs with greater lateral extents deform uniaxially and the same was considered in our study while assessing the depletion stress path. Few researchers, based on their numerical modeling and analytical solutions, have pointed out that vertical arching has a considerable effect on the depleting reservoirs and advocated a range of 20\u201350% vertical arching during depletion (Kenter et al., 1998; Mulders, 2003). Unfortunately, field measurements to assess the magnitude of the vertical arching effect is unavailable. Summarily, availability of core data from the old producing giant oil fields is always an issue, rather common one and as a result, the reservoir geomechanical workflow is dependent on various assumptions to achieve the best possible results.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study presents the vertical stress, pore pressure, and Shmin magnitudes in the El Morgan oil field, both in the virgin as well as present-day depleted conditions. Hydrocarbon production and repressurization by fluid injection, both the processes can provoke failures within the reservoir interval as well as the overlying caprock. The depletion stress path analysis presented the reservoirs' behaviors in response to prolonged production. The maximum sustainable repressurization window has been constrained by the pore pressure-stress coupling conduct, which are satisfied by the caprock fracturing limits. The highly permeable lower Kareem reservoir intervals indicate higher stress path values very close to its critical failure thresholds and also offers smaller repressurization window during fluid injection in comparison to the Hammam Faraun reservoir. We inferred the possible uncertainties induced by the assumptions behind Biot's coefficient and frictional coefficient and recommend core measurements to be done to generate more confident results. However, the presented workflow offers a careful understanding of the subsurface geomechanics amid the minimum data availability (i.e., core measurements etc.) and will aid in optimizing the hydrocarbon depletion as well as water injection rates by ensuring subsurface integrity.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nAhmed E.

The relationship between in-situ stresses and rock fracturing is generally well-known from both theoretical (Pollard and Segall, 1987) and empirical rock mechanical studies (Kranz, 1983), which have shown how variable stress states (magnitude and orientation) and rock properties (including anisotropy) affect the orientation and type of fractures formed (e.g. Amadei, 1996; Pollard and Aydin, 1990; Segall and Pollard, 1980). Applying the principles of rock mechanical behavior to studies of bedrock fracturing introduces an overriding problem as the (paleo) stress responsible for the generation of the observed fractures has to be indirectly inferred from the structures and kinematic indicators. Investigations linking paleostresses to the fracture pattern are challenged by complexities within fracture patterns caused by i) polyphase deformation leading to several fracture generations and challenges in reliable determination of the relative ages of the fractures (Peacock, 2001; Scheiber and Viola, 2018), ii) structural inheritance (Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2005; Samsu et al., 2020; Skytt\u00e4 and Torvela, 2018), iii) reactivation (Dutta and Mukherjee, 2019; Mattila and Viola, 2014; Rawnsley et al., 1992; Viola et al., 2009), iv) compositional heterogeneities, such as the grain size of the (intrusive) rocks (McCaffrey et al., 2003) and layering within sedimentary rocks (Carlini et al., 2019; Douma et al., 2019; Procter and Sanderson, 2018), and v) the structural anisotropy of the bedrock.\nConsidering the control of pre-existing structural heterogeneity on fracture generation, microscopic-scale heterogeneities are inferred to act as nucleating sites for micro-fractures (Anders et al., 2014; Crider, 2015; Griffith, 1921), whereas mesoscopic to macroscopic planar structures such as bedding, foliation or shear planes exert a strong control over the orientation of the generated fractures (Amadei, 1996; Behrestagni et al., 2018; Bose et al., 2020; Manda et al., 2008; Nejati et al., 2020). Furthermore, the relationship between brittle faulting and development of the damage zones (DZ) with pronounced fracturing are widely studied from the perspectives of fracture orientations (Woodcock and Fischer, 1986), types of damage zones (Kim et al., 2004; Peacock et al., 2017), delineation of damage zone extents (Choi et al., 2016), and damage zone extents as a function of slip magnitude or fault length (Faulkner et al., 2011; Perrin et al., 2016; Scholz, 2019). Whereas correlations between macroscopic deformation structures and fracture patterns exist for e.g. cylindrical folds (Bazalgette et al., 2010; Price, 1966; Stearns, 1969; Watkins et al., 2018) and previous works have also discussed structural inheritance at various scales \u2013 from faults to entire rift basins (Phillips et al., 2019; Rotevatn et al., 2018), the role of structural inheritance from tectonic faults on later-forming regional fracture systems has not been studied in detail yet. Evidence for structural inheritance from spatially extensive fractures on later-developed fracture networks does exist, but in such cases the early-formed fractures are typically related to non-tectonic features such as early diagenesis of platform carbonates (La Bruna et al., 2020; Lavenu and Lamarche, 2018) and thermal processes such as cooling of intrusions (Crider, 2015; English, 2012; Petford, 2003; Pollard and Aydin, 1990; Sanders et al., 2003; Segall and Pollard, 1983; Yuguchi et al., 2012).\nIn this paper we show that the formation of discrete faults and kinematically associated syn-fault extension fractures in mesoscopically isotropic rocks resulted in a mechanical anisotropy into the bedrock, which further controlled the patterns of the later-formed fractures (\u201cregional fractures\u201d hereafter). We further infer that such structural control is responsible for generation of specific fracture domains in which the present-day fracture patterns selectively reflect both the syn-fault evolution and the later-formed fractures. We also show that sub-parallel segments of incipient faults may be linked by syn-fault extension fractures, resulting in much wider damage zones than that predicted by existing scaling laws.\nWe conduct the investigation on the islands of Orrengrund and B\u00e5ks\u00f6ren, Gulf of Finland, which provide a good coverage of high-quality glacially polished outcrops for 2D mapping of fracture and fault traces in anorogenic 1.6\u00a0Ga Rapakivi granite (Fig. 1\n). The bedrock of this area is homogeneous and mesoscopically isotropic, and transected by discrete faults which are associated with syn-fault extension fractures, both later overprinted by regional fractures of an unspecified origin. Moreover, the slip magnitude of the faults is limited (<20\u00a0cm), which provides an exceptional view into the early evolution of faulting and DZ generation. These prerequisites allow us to investigate the faults and related structures, and evaluate their effect upon the development of later fractures, without the need to account for further mesoscopic crustal anisotropy (e.g. foliation), complex deformation histories and (other) pre-existing structures.\nWe approach the research problems through fracture and fault mapping from drone-images supplemented with reconnaissance field observations (Table 1\n\n). Assigning the relative timing of the different fracture types (using fracture terminology according to Peacock et al., 2016) is an essential element of this work, and we base our interpretation on the abutting\/cross-cutting relationships (see e.g. Peacock, 2001) and fracture patterns observed in the field and from the drone-acquired images. We characterize the discrete faults (kinematics and damage zones) and use the results in distinguishing the syn-fault extension fractures from the subsequent regional fractures. Thereafter, we develop our findings into a spatial fracture model of the site, including insight into i) the paleostress constraints, ii) strain localization patterns, and iii) how this understanding may be used in sub-dividing the area of interest into fracture domains characterized by contrasting fracture properties. We further discuss the plausibility of the fracture domain subdivision in the light of fracture connectivity analysis (relative proportion of X-, Y- and I topological nodes; Manzocchi, 2002) and orientation distribution within the delineated fracture domains.\nThis work contributes towards understanding the coupled evolution of the discrete faults and bedrock fracturing. The results add up to the so far incomplete database of brittle deformation events of the bedrock of Fennoscandia (Mattila and Viola, 2014; Viola et al., 2011). This investigation further provides an excellent dataset for future investigations focusing in the rock mechanical behavior of faults and their effect on fracture distribution in a crystalline bedrock.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe bedrock of the study area is part of the anorogenic Mesoproterozoic 1.65\u20131.62\u00a0Ga Wiborg batholith (R\u00e4m\u00f6 and Haapala, 2005) which was emplaced under an E-W extensional regime (Haapala and R\u00e4m\u00f6, 1992; Korja and Heikkinen, 1995; Nironen, 1997) associated with upward bulging of the mantle (Haapala and R\u00e4m\u00f6, 1992; Luosto et al., 1990) and emplacement of NW-trending diabase dykes (R\u00e4m\u00f6 and Haapala, 2005). The batholith emplacement was potentially controlled by reactivation of subduction-related weak zones within the lithospheric mantle (Haapala and R\u00e4m\u00f6, 1992; R\u00e4m\u00f6 and Haapala, 2005) or listric shear zones that caused extension within a thickened crust (Korja and Heikkinen, 1995). However, there are no studies known to the authors with evidence of localized deformation or penetrative tectonic fabrics within the rocks exposed at the surface. No significant compositional variation or separate intrusive units are present within the study area (Fig. 1) and any potential structural anisotropies correspond to weak magmatic foliations (Karell et al., 2014) or the presence of quartz-feldspar porphyry and diabase dykes, and greisen or quartz veins (R\u00e4m\u00f6 and Haapala, 2005). Particularly interesting for the Loviisa area are the two sets of Indium-rich polymetallic greisen veins: a set of NE to NNE trending veins and the slightly younger set of NW-NNW trending veins (Generations 2a and 2b by Broman et al., 2018; Valkama et al., 2016). Regionally occurring barren opening-mode fractures transecting the intrusion comprise two subvertical NE-ENE and NW-NNW striking sets (Ovaskainen, 2020) and one sub-horizontal set, defining an overall cubic fracture pattern in 3D (Okko et al., 2003).\n\n\n3\nMethods\nThe relevant methods, data and workflow are outlined in Table 1. The core of data used within this investigation is formed by aerial photographs acquired by UAV at a flight elevation of 20\u00a0m, resulting in a pixel size of 0.55\u00a0cm for the output raster images. We took the drone images with a minimum of 60\u201370% overlap, georeferenced the images using 10 VRS-GPS ground control points for each surveyed area and processed the aerial photos into orthomosaics with Agisoft PhotoScan software (v1.4.4., 2018). 2D-map of fault and fracture traces exposed on the glacially polished outcrops of the Orrengrund and B\u00e5ksoren islands are compiled using the orthophotographs and subsequently supplemented with reconnaissance field observations of fracture characteristics and dips. The dataset includes 37\u00a0075 fracture and fault trace lines manually digitized in ArcGIS software from an area of 73\u00a0200\u00a0m2 (Appendix 1). The well-exposed outcrop parts typically extend 50\u2013100\u00a0m inland from the coast line along the southern and western shores of the Orrengrund and B\u00e5ks\u00f6ren islands, whereas the exposures in the North and East are narrow and discontinuous (Fig. 2\n; Appendix 2).\nAs the first step of our structural analysis, we analyze the orientation of all the trace lines with length-weighted equal-area rose plots (Sanderson and Peacock, 2020) and visual inspection of fracture trace maps (Table 1). Visual inspection is required because a purely rose plot -based orientation analysis would fail to capture fracture sets that contain the N-S-striking faults and syn-fault fractures due to their relative scarcity and spatial variance compared to the more through going nature of the regional fractures. Subsequently, we use the generated fracture trace dataset and field observations to recognize discrete faults (Fig. 3\na and b), for which we define the damage zones (DZ; Peacock et al., 2017); by visually delineating the extent of mutually (sub)parallel fractures, which are spatially associated with the N-S faults and deviate from the trends of the regional fractures (see e.g. Fig. 4\n\n). We analyze the kinematics of the faults using the very limited amount of observed offsets markers and fault surface slip lineations. As very few lineation data are available due to the 2D-nature of the glacially polished outcrops, we use the geometrical relationships between the slip surfaces and the dominant set of kinematically associated syn-fault fractures within the damage zones to determine the shear direction \u2013 the slip vector is perpendicular to the line of intersection of the main slip surface and the DZ fractures (Fossen, 2016) \u2013 and to provide a first-pass assessment about the regional paleostress domain responsible for the faulting.\nSubsequently, we utilize these results to distinguish between the fault-induced fractures and the regional fractures particularly outside the direct damage zones of the faults. To support the visual analysis, we analyze the fracture Set length distributions and topological relationships to reveal potential linkages to the faults and to support the field observations about the relative timing between the fracture Sets. We analyze the topological cross-cutting and abutting relationships using a spatial intersect analysis of fracture traces and nodes acquired with NetworkGT software (Nyberg et al., 2018). We use the proportion of Y- and X-nodes between selected Sets and abutment relations for each of the observed Y-nodes, plot the node counts for a selected pairs of fracture Sets on bar plots, and use qualitatively to interpret the relative timing of fracture Sets. This approach does not use the lengths of the traces that form the nodes as any kind of weights and we therefore limit this analysis to traces over 5\u00a0m in length to filter out the numerous smaller fractures. The method has its limitations as we do not quantify the statistical significance of the relative node count proportions depending on at least the number of traces in each set and the total node count sample size, and because the fracture Set classification is purely orientation-based.\nWe model Set length distributions using a power law trend (Bonnet et al., 2001) to assess the correlation between origins of the Sets (fault, syn-fault extension fracture or regional fracture) and the Set length distribution characteristics. According to Davy et al. (2010), fractures formed in low fracture density conditions grow freely without much interference from other fractures whereas fracture growth rate in high density conditions is limited by other fractures. Differences in growth rate are reflected in the exponent of the fitted power law model, with e.g., lower negative exponent correlating with growth conditions with high fracture density. The resolution of the orthophotographs sets a minimum limit to the length of fracture traces that are accurately digitized and consequently a portion of fractures starting from the smallest does not follow a power law trend. Therefore, a minimum trace length i.e. a cut-off is applied by cutting all fracture traces smaller than the visually determined cut-off (1.8\u00a0m) from the length distribution data and then fitting the power law trend to the remaining distribution data. This is a simple approach for modelling the length distributions with limitations, but a deeper analysis of the set-wise length distributions is outside the scope of this paper. Subsequently, we make a structural synthesis over the fault-evolution of the site, explaining the relationship between the faults and the syn-fault fractures. We use this synthesis along with fracture intensity (P21; Dershowitz and Herda, 1992); in evaluating how the resulted fault-induced structural anisotropy controlled subsequent fracturing and develop the findings into a preliminary fracture domain model explaining the contrasts in fracture patterns across the study area. Finally, we discuss the findings from the perspective of the evolution of brittle deformation in the Fennoscandian Shield.\n\n\n4\nStructural data and observations\n\n4.1\nOverview\nThe studied rapakivi granite comprises up to 5\u00a0cm diameter feldspar ovoids embedded within a finer-grained groundmass of primarily feldspar and quartz. The rocks display minute variation in color and composition within the study area, are mescopically isotropic, and lack any recognizable fabrics visible to the naked eye (Fig. 1b). Within the aerial images from the study area, no gouge-bearing fault cores are recognizable. For this reason, we distinguished faults from other fractures primarily using the spatial patterns of the discontinuities, with support from field observations. As a result, several approximately N-S trending faults are recognized from associated damage zones characterized by obliquely oriented fractures abutting against the fault traces (Fig. 2a; 3a,b). Fracture patterns outside the faults and their immediate damage zones are more complex (Fig. 3c and d) and understanding their systematics requires that we first define which fractures are synchronous with, and kinematically associated to the faults, and what is their relationship with the remaining fractures. According to our findings reported in Sections 4.2.-4.5., and the recommended use of terminology (Peacock et al., 2016), we call the approximately N-S fractures \u201cfaults\u201d (Set 1 in Fig. 2b). Fractures which are synchronous with, and kinematically associated to the faults are called syn-fault \u201cextension fractures\u201d (Sets 2 and 3 in Fig. 2b) as they originated as opening-mode wing-crack type fractures at the tip-DZs of the N-S faults. Some of the extension fractures were reactivated as \u201cshear fractures\u201d (Section 5.1). The remaining fractures, not associated with the faults, are hereafter called \u201cregional fractures\u201d (Sets 4 & 5 in Fig. 2b).\n\n\n4.2\nCharacterization of the N-S faults\nSeveral discrete, approximately N-S trending sub-vertical faults, recognized from variably developed damage zones (Figs. 4, 5a and 6\na; App. 2) and narrow gouge zones (Fig. 6b), cut the bedrock of the study area. We summarize the main properties of all the recognized faults in Table 2 and characterize the three most significant faults in more detail, with complementary field data.\n\n\nFault S1:\n S1 is the largest fault of the study area and it is exposed in full length on the B\u00e5ks\u00f6ren Island (Figs. 2a and 4a). S1 dips steeply to the east, has a total lateral tip-to-tip extent of 180\u00a0m and is characterized by well-developed patterns of extension fractures within the damage zones (Figs. 4a and 5a,b; App. 1 & 2), all indicating sinistral sense of movement along the fault. The most distinctive DZs are of the combined wall\/tip type, characterized by a pattern of wing-crack fractures oblique to, and abutting against the main fault close to its both terminations (\u201cI\u201d in Fig. 4a). The largest tip\/wall DZ spatially associated with the southern fault termination is approximately 35m by 60m in width and length. The fault is comprised of two sub-parallel segments kinematically linked at the left-handed releasing step-over (linking DZ at \u201cII\u201d; Fig. 5a). The step-over hosts NNE-dipping fractures, some of which are locally infilled with quartz and pseudotachylyte. These dilatant veins indicate local extension of so-far undetermined magnitude (Fig. 5b). One further type of DZ is associated with a minor restraining fault bend, leading to the generation of short extension fractures defining a recognizable fault bend DZ on both sides of the fault (\u201cIII\u201d). Fractures within all the DZs (with approximately 70\u00b0 dips) are gentler than the regional fractures observed outside the DZs (80\u201390\u00b0 dips). No slip lineation was observed in the field, but a sub-horizontal south-plunging (167\/13; trend\/plunge) slip vector indicative of strike-slip faulting could be determined from the relationship of the fault plane and the secondary fractures (Inset in Fig. 4a).\nContinuous WNW-ESE trending extension fractures (Set 2) parallel with the wing-cracks at the southern tip-DZ constrain the southern extent of S1 and link it to another approximately N-S striking sinistral fault (S2). The linking WNW-ESE fractures are frequently arranged into a right-stepping pattern, and secondary fractures within the step-overs (\u201cIV\u201d) indicates dextral sense of movement along these fractures. Consequently, the WNW-ESE features define the dextral fault D3.\n\n\nFault S3:\n The sub-vertical, N-S trending S3 fault has an observed trace length of 48\u00a0m but neither of the fault terminations are exposed (Fig. 4b): In the north, fracture patterns visible from the partially vegetated outcrops indicate fault continuity. To the south, the fault trace continues beyond the shoreline, and the fault is associated with a relatively wide wall-DZ. In the central part, the fault has a core domain defined by two slip surfaces separated by approximately 60\u00a0cm, and one of these exposes a sub-horizontally south-plunging slickenline lineation on a mica-rich fault surface (Fig. 5c). The volume between the slip surfaces contains a linking-type DZ characterized by fault-parallel minor faults, and fault-parallel and oblique fractures (Fig. 5d). Locally, linked systems of minor faults and extensional veins comparable to extensional pull-apart basins (Fig. 5d) have been developed. S3 is associated with a wall-type DZ which shows significant along-strike variations, reaching the largest extent (width 5\u00a0m, length 25\u00a0m) in the southern part of the fault. The DZ is defined by the presence of NNE-dipping extension fractures which dips are gentler with respect to the regional fractures. Fracture patterns within the linking and wall-DZ indicate sinistral sense of movement. Determination of the slip vector from the main fault and the secondary DZ-fractures results in a value of 173\/23 which is comparable but slightly steeper than the observed slickenline lineation (158\/10), both indicating dominantly strike-slip type deformation along the fault surface.\n\n\nFault D1:\n D1 is the largest recognized dextral fault of the study area with a minimum trace length of 65\u00a0m (the fault is unexposed from both terminations). D1 comprises of two sub-parallel, steeply east-dipping slip surfaces (Fig. 4c): the western, main slip surface is curved and shows two minor releasing bends, tip\/wall-type DZ in the southern part (Fig. 6a), cataclastic deformation within the approximately 2\u00a0cm wide fault core (Fig. 6b), and local development of mm-wide pseudotachylyte veins along the slip surfaces. The eastern slip surface is more linear and characterized by a wall\/tip DZ in the north, and several discrete small-scale extensional pull-apart basins generated along the strike of the surface, indicating approximately 4\u00a0cm slip offsets (Fig. 6c). Additional to the wall\/tip DZs, linking DZ characterized by sparse, slightly curved NE-SW trending extension fractures has been developed between the slip surfaces. DZ fractures dip steeply to the SSE, with an average dips of 74\u00b0, which is clearly gentler with respect to the regional fractures (dips\u00a0>\u00a080\u00b0). The geometrical relationship between the fault surface and the secondary fractures (e.g. Fig. 6a) indicates sub-horizontal north-plunging slip orientation (014\/15), compatible with a strike-slip faulting regime.\n\n\n4.3\nRelationships between fractures\n\n4.3.1\nRelative timing\nRegional fractures belonging to the approximately orthogonally trending orientation Sets 1 and 2 (Fig. 2b) typically crosscut and abut each another (Fig. 7\na), for which reason they may be considered synchronous. However, they either terminate against the N-S trending faults (Fig. 7b; fracture Set 1 in Fig. 2b), or their orientation or intensity locally changes in spatial vicinity with the faults (Section 4.3.). Consequently, based on abutting\/cross-cutting relationship, we infer that, the regional fractures post-date the formation of the faults and syn-fault extension fractures (Section 4.2). Length and topology analysis of the fracture sets further supports the interpreted relative timing relationships: The continuous WNW-ESE trending fractures of Set 2 terminate at the N-S faults (Set 1; Fig. 7c and d), which, together with the demonstrated kinematic linkage (Fig. 4), indicates Set 2 generated synchronous with faulting. Sets 1 and 2 are further similarly characterized by longer, more continuous, traces indicated by the highest power law exponents of \u22121.55 and \u22121.52, respectively (Fig. 7c). By contrast, lower power law exponents (<-1.7) and abutment against Set 2 characterize the fracture Sets 4 and 5 (Fig. 7c and d), based on which fractures belonging to the dominant regional Sets 4 and 5 also post-date the faults and the syn-fault extension fractures of Sets 2 and 3.\nResults of the topological analysis (Fig. 7d) conducted for data covering the whole study area do not clarify the relationship between the regional fractures and the NE-SW Set 3 fractures, kinematically linked to the N-S trending dextral faults D1 and D2. The reason is that the Set 3 fractures occur within a limited area spatially associated to faults D1 and D2, and are for this reason indistinguishable from the regional Set 4 in stereograms visualizing the data covering all the study area (Fig. 2b). However, regional fractures of Sets 4 and 5 predominantly abut against the NE-SW trending Set 3 fractures, and Set 3 fractures are more continuous with respect to the regional Sets 4 and 5 (Figs. 3d and 4c). Consequently, syn-fault extension fractures of Set 3, kinematically linked with the dextral faults, pre-date the regional fractures of Sets 4 and 5.\n\nFig. 7e shows the only direct cross-cutting relationship between the sinistral and dextral faults or the associated syn-fault extension fractures: Minor dextral slip of approximately 3\u00a0cm occurred along the eastern slip surface of fault D1 and caused offset of the syn-fault extension fractures of Set 2. This indicates that dextral faulting occurred later than sinistral faulting, but the observed fracture patterns around fault D1 are conflicting with such timing: most NW-SE trending Set 2 extension fractures associated with sinistral faulting terminate against the D1 slip surfaces and hence indicate either synchronous or post-dating, not pre-dating relative timing with respect to dextral faulting. Consequently, we interpret that dextral and sinistral faulting occurred roughly at the same time, prior to the generation of the regional fracture sets, and deformation along the more localized, planar eastern D1 slip surface occurred during a late stage of the faulting event.\n\n\n4.3.2\nPatterns of the regional fractures in spatial association with faults and syn-fault fractures\nComparing the regional fracture sets, the ENE-WSW trending Set 4 occurs largely unaffected across the study area, whereas the orientation and the intensity of the NNW-SSE trending Set 5 is generally more affected by the pre-existing structures. Poor development of Set 5 is observed in areas where sub-parallel fractures pre-existed the Set 5. Such areas include the immediate DZs of the sinistral faults (e.g. Fig. 4a) and domains of pronounced occurrence of the NW-SE trending Set 4 extension fractures (Fig. 8\na). Even though the orientation of Set 4 fractures remain relatively unchanged, their localization is still locally affected as shown by the presence of a through-going Set 4 fracture just next to the terminations of the N-S fault and the associated tip-DZ (Fig. 8b). Moreover, Set 4 fractures are locally seen to bend towards right angles when approaching pre-existing fault-induced fractures.\n\n\n\n\n5\nStructural interpretation\n\n5.1\nStructural synthesis of the faults and the kinematically linked fractures\nAll the major faults in the area are sub-vertical and associated with sub-horizontal or gently-plunging lineations, compatible with an overall strike-slip faulting domain. The majority of the faults, including the largest S1 fault, display sinistral kinematics as concluded from fracture patterns in their DZs, and indicate that the main principal stress component (\u03c31) at the time of faulting had an approximately NW-SE orientation. The NW-SE trending extension fractures (Set 2), kinematically linked to the sinistral faults, occur as the predominant set within an area between S1 and S8 faults. For this reason, we interpret that the area between S8 and the northern termination of S1 is a major extensional left-handed step-over (Fig. 9\na). Moreover, we interpret from the presence of a topographic depression and the minor S8 fault, that the N-S trending small bay in the central part of the Orrengrund island, is underlain by a sinistral fault (S9) comparable in size to S1. In this interpretation the sinistral S8 (Fig. 9b) is a lower-order slip surface occurring parallel to the unexposed first-order fault S9.\nAnalogous to dextral slip along fault D3, the similarly oriented NW-SE (to WNW-ESE) Set 2 extension fractures frequently show evidence for dextral slip along them (Fig. 9b and c). As the slips and DZs related to this dextral faulting are limited, we interpret that it occurred during progressive deformation of the controlling sinistral N-S faults: the NW-SE Set 2 fractures initially formed as extension fractures but were later reactivated as shear fractures, forming a conjugate system with the sinistral N-S faults, compatible with approximately NW-SE \u2013oriented maximum compressive stress \u03c31.\nOrigin of the D1 fault is incompatible with the NW-SE \u03c31 orientation responsible for the generation of the dominant sinistral faults. However, field relations indicate that slip along the most prominent dextral slip surface was synchronous with sinistral faulting (Section 4.3.1.). Furthermore, occurrence of the structurally similar but smaller dextral D2 fault on the northern shore of Orrengrund indicate that the dextral features are not isolated and potentially negligible features but need to be addressed within the same dynamic context with the dominant sinistral faults. Consequently, we interpret that D1 and D2 are part of a single segmented dextral zone which has at least 350\u00a0m along-strike length, but more limited influence on fracturing with respect to that caused by the sinistral faults. The occurrence of the NE-SW trending (Set 3) fractures kinematically linked to the dextral D1-D2 fault is primarily limited to the closest 100\u2013200\u00a0m range from the fault traces. Bearing this in mind, we attribute the generation of faults with opposite shear senses to contrasting strain rate between the sinistral and dextral faults during one single deformation event (Dutta and Mukherjee, 2019). This eventually caused a southward movement of the bedrock block bound by the dextral D1-D2 fault and the sinistral faults occurring to the east of it (blue arrow in Fig. 9a).\nAs demonstrated above, syn-fault fractures (of Sets 2 & 3) related to both sinistral and dextral faults occur systematically at scales much wider scales than the \u201cnormal DZs\u201d, and result in the presence of \u201cwide DZs\u201d up to at least 300 m widths between the segments of approximately N-S trending faults (Fig. 9a; Section 5.2.2.; Fracture domain II).\n\n\n5.2\nSpatial model of fractures\nGeneration of the ~N-S faults and the kinematically linked syn-fault extension fractures (Section 4.2) resulted in a network of discontinuities which define a specific fault-related structural and mechanical anisotropy within the previously isotropic bedrock of the study area. This anisotropy had a localized controlling effect upon the subsequent regional fractures through development of fault reactivation DZs (Section 5.2.1), which in turn contributed to the development of specific fracture domains (Section 5.2.2.) explaining the heterogeneity of fracturing observed in the study area.\n\n5.2.1\nFault reactivation damage zones\nAn important feature causing deviations in the orientations of regional fractures is the development of fault reactivation DZs (Figs. 4a and 8c) in which the later-formed regional fractures show deviation from the characteristic orientations and intensities. The fault reactivation DZs were generated primarily around the larger faults and areas of fault interaction, but also along some dextrally reactivated Set 2 fractures (Fig. 8d). These zones are not homogeneous but show marked asymmetry and along-fault discontinuity, which allows regional fractures to extend all the way to the slip surfaces without any changes in their orientations in many places (Fig. 4a). We attribute the deviations in regional fracture orientation (and intensity) to minor fault reactivation associated with releasing of the regional stresses along faults at the time when the regional fractures were generated, and infer that the development of the fault reactivation DZs follow comparable rock mechanical principles as the regular DZs.\n\n\n5.2.2\nDevelopment of structurally controlled fracture domains\nBased on the spatial variation of the fracture patterns, we sub-divided the study area into seven fracture domains, whose boundaries are defined by the ~N-S faults and the abrupt changes in the fracture intensity (P21; Dershowitz and Herda, 1992) which occur in spatial connection with long individual fractures (Fig. 10\na,d). These individual fractures do stand out on the fracture map due to their lengths but are not associated with any distinct secondary fractures, and, for this reason, were previously not classified as faults (Section 4.2).\n\n\nDomain I\n within the southern part of the study area, to the south-west of fault S1, is characterized by the dominance of Set 4 and 5 regional fractures, and the absence of fractures kinematically related to the N-S faults (Fig. 10b). Fractures within \nDomain II\n are dominated by the NW-SE to WNW-ESE trending syn-fault (Set 2) fractures within the major step-over occurring to the west of fault S1. Set 4 is well-developed within this domain, but the pronounced presence of Set 2 fractures has prevented the development of the sub-parallel Set 5 fractures. However, fractures parallel to the NNW-SSE trending Set 5 are present, but they are most commonly associated with small releasing step-overs developed along the dextrally reactivated Set 2 fractures (Section 5.1.; Fig. 9b). Consequently, the NNW-SSE fractures are short and do not define a penetrative fracture fabric comparable to Domain I.\n\n\nDomain III\n deviates from the apparently similar domain II with regard to Set 2 fractures which within domain III are less continuous and their occurrence is primarily localized on the western walls of the ~N-S faults. As the ~N-S faults also control the overall fracture intensity (Fig. 10a), we used faults S3, S5 and U1 to subdivide domain III into four sub-domains (IIIa-d). Moreover, we defined the western margin of domain IIId at a large N-S trending Set 1 fracture which is spatially coincident with a distinct change in fracture intensity.\nThe presence of syn-fault NE-SW (ENE \u2013WSW) trending Set 3 fractures kinematically associated with the zone of dextral faulting (D1-D2) characterize \nDomain IV.\n Together with the more penetrative Set 2 fractures, they define a relatively sparse orthogonal pattern, which occurs at a small angle to another near-orthogonal fracture network defined by the overprinting regional fractures (Sets 4 & 5; Fig. 10c). Sub-domains IVa and IVb share similar fracture orientations but the intensity of fractures is significantly lower in IVa. Set 3 fractures related to dextral faulting within domain IV are recognizable also within sub-domains IIId and IIIc, making the domains III and IV partially overlapping in character (green and magenta bars in Fig. 10a).\nThe eastern boundary of \nDomain V\n (Fig. 10d) is defined analogously to the domain III\/IV -boundary, and the largest difference from domains III and IV is that the dominant fracturing (Set 2) becomes approximately E-W in trend. The regional Set 4 is present while only little direct effect of the ~N-S faults is visible. The overall fracture intensity within this domain is higher than in most other domains. Transition between domains V and VI is gradational and \nDomain VI\n displays a near-orthogonal fracture pattern consisting of two fracture sets trending ENE-WSW and NNW-SSE. Most of the recognized fracture sets are present within \nDomain VII\n, but no clear systematics may be recognized due to the small coverage and isolated occurrence of the outcrops within the domain.\n\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nIn this investigation we describe a set of sub-vertical strike slip faults with kinematically linked, and subsequent cross-cutting fractures which transect the anorogenic 1.65\u20131.62\u00a0Ga Rapakivi granites in southern Finland. The excellent exposures, mesoscopically isotropic character of the rock and limited fault slips (<20\u00a0cm) provide an outstanding possibility to discuss the evolution of the faults and associated damage zones within crystalline rocks, as well as their control over the subsequent fracture patterns. The discussions about the fracture domain-formation will provide working hypotheses to be tested by forthcoming investigations incorporating rigorous rock mechanical modelling and in-depth analysis of fracture systems within the domains.\n\n6.1\nEarly evolution of the faults and the associated generation of damage zones\nFaults were formed in mesoscopically isotropic, homogeneous host rock and no observable mechanical anisotropy existed during the time of the faulting. Consequently, the formation of damage zones can be directly associated with the faulting and propagation of the fault and associated stress perturbations along the fault or along interacting faults.\nAccording to the general understanding of fault development, DZ widths increase with increasing fault slip, and the thickness of the fault core shows positive correlation with the fault length and slip. However, no universally functioning linear relationship is applicable as the length\/slip ratios show a variability of up to two magnitudes depending on e.g. the hosting lithology (Faulkner et al., 2011; Perrin et al., 2016; Scholz, 2019). Due to the variable surface erosion of the margins of the mapped discontinuities exposed on the natural outcrops of this study, leading to apparent apertures, we have no systematic measures for the fault core thicknesses or fracture apertures, and only one unambiguous offset marker (Fig. 7e) was available. For these reasons, we use the i) 2\u00a0cm cataclastic breccias observed along the main slip surface of fault D1, and ii) the 3\u00a0cm offset along the subsidiary D1 slip surface as minimum values for fault core thickness and slip. Moreover, we use iii) fault S1 in scaling damage zone extent with fault length, as it is the only fault with full exposure of both the trace length and the DZ, and iv) the 5\u00a0m wide wall-DZ of S3 fault in scaling the DZ widths.\nThe 2\u00a0cm core thickness of the D1 fault corresponds to 0.2\u20132\u00a0m slip using the 1:10 to 1:100 ratios applicable to rocks with high to intermediate cohesion (Scholz, 2019). Using the minimum ratio of D\u00a0=\u00a010\u22123\u00a0L (D\u00a0=\u00a0displacement, L\u00a0=\u00a0length; e.g. Kim and Sanderson, 2005), fault S1 with 180m trace length should have a displacement of 0.18\u00a0m, comparable to most conservative estimate (0.2\u00a0m) derived from the core thickness vs. displacement relation. According to the scaling relationships between fault displacement and DZ width, (e.g. Scholz, 2019), the 0.18m displacement corresponds to DZ width of approximately 0.18\u00a0m, whereas based on the scaling relationship developed for the high-grade rocks of Olkiluoto, SW Finland (Pere et al., 2012), the 2\u00a0cm core width indicates a DZ width one magnitude higher, i.e. 2-3\u00a0m. Despite the range within the above estimations, the derived 0.18\u00a0m and 2\u20133m DZ widths are compatible to the 60\u00a0cm and 5\u00a0m width of the core domain and the DZ of fault S3, i.e. the observed values are within the range of variance given by the scaling equations. Another viewpoint into the DZ extent is given by the relationship between the fault length and the tip DZ area required to cover the secondary fractures and faults (Kim and Sanderson, 2005). The approximately 30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a070\u00a0m (width\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0length) extent of the tip-DZ within the southern termination of fault S1 is well in line with the average of the scaling of Perrin et al. (2016) indicating average lengths of 0.34 and width of 0.09 times the fault length for the tip DZ. However, the scaling equations of Perrin et al. (2016) are not further linked to the fault slip magnitude and, consequently, cannot be used in the evaluation of the slip magnitude. Despite the uncertainties, the limited fault scaling measures (above) appear useful as they show that the fault slip magnitudes were very limited and, together with the poor development of continuous wall-DZs, indicate that the preserved structural signatures relate to an incipient stage of fault evolution.\nThe extent of the \u201cwide DZs\u201d - defined by the continuous fault-related fractures occurring between the N-S faults of this investigation - may not be explained by the displacement magnitude along the bounding faults. The development of DZ widths of larger than 100\u00a0m would require displacements of over 100\u00a0m, and kilometers to tens of kilometers long faults (Faulkner et al., 2011; Scholz, 2019). Since DZs widths, after a threshold range of a few hundred meters, do not grow significantly (Scholz, 2019), wide DZs could possibly result from the interactions of several faults (Kim et al., 2004; Peacock et al., 2017), typically leading to heterogeneous fracture intensity distributions (Ostermeijer et al., 2020). An example of exceptionally wide DZs are found within the Ordovician carbonates of the Tarim Basin, where the observed DZ had widths up to 3.5\u00a0km (Ma et al., 2019; Wan et al., 2016). Wu et al. (2019) attributed the wide DZs to the superimposing effect of several faults, including outward growth of secondary faults. However, slips of several hundreds to thousands of meters along the up to 70\u00a0km long master strike-slip faults (Wu et al., 2019) are still within the magnitude of the scaling laws (op. cit.) and hence not comparable to the extreme 1:1 DZ width vs. individual fault segment length (S1) relationship associated with the \u201cwide-DZs\u201d noted in this investigation. The overall lack of fault-related Y- and P-fractures within the area of this study is in line with the small observed displacement magnitudes due to which the formation of wall damage zone has not progressed very far. This further indicates that the formation of the \u201cwide DZs\u201d is the result of interactions between the fault segments and associated stress perturbations.\nEarlier in this paper, we attributed fault-induced fracturing within Fracture domain II to the presence of a large pull-apart structure between faults S1 and S9. This origin is comparable to the development of type I tension veins between two parallel fault segments along fault S3 (\u201cBSF in Fig. 5d), or within pull-apart basins of overlapping geometries (Corti et al., 2020; Corti and Dooley, 2015; Dooley and McClay, 1997; Kim et al., 2004). Based on the wide extent of the syn-fault fractures (Set 2 & 3) across fracture domain V, we infer that the faulting-stage involved multiple discontinuous N-S faults that were kinematically linked across wide distances with respect to the length of the individual fault segments, and the resulting fracture patterns markedly exceed any existing scaling laws.\n\n\n6.2\nFracture domain subdivision\nA pre-existing fabric will typically contribute to the development of the cross-cutting fractures (Amadei, 1996), but the question of mechanical anisotropy is more complex as for a discontinuity (fault\/fracture) to affect the origin and orientation of later fractures, there needs to be a stress perturbation at that location. This further means that at the time of the formation of the regional fractures, the faults were reactivated and were thus in orientation optimal for reactivation with respect to the prevailing stress state. In this study, the mechanical anisotropy is characterized by the N-S faults and the kinematically associated syn-fault extension fractures, and hence contrasting to the non-tectonic origins of fractures in crystalline rocks arising from thermal processes within cooling intrusions (Crider, 2015; Pollard and Aydin, 1990; Sanders et al., 2003; Segall and Pollard, 1983; Yuguchi et al., 2012). Further, recognition of the \u201cfault reactivation DZs\u201d (Section 5.2.1.; Fig. 4a) indicates that the reactivation of the faults exerted major control upon the development of the overprinting fractures. Consequently, we evaluate the fracture domain sub-division (Section 5.2.2.) in the scale of faults-bound blocks, as fracture properties in general (Ovaskainen, 2020), and specifically in the case of structural inheritance are not scale-invariant (Samsu et al., 2020).\nThe validity of the fracture domain sub-division, which is based on visual judgement and fracture intensity (P21), is supported by the contrasts within the fracture connectivity (Fig. 11\na and b) and orientation (Fig. 11c) between the defined domains. Fracture connectivity within the domains is visualized with the connections per branch parameter and node proportion plots are shown for all domains (Manzocchi, 2002; Sanderson and Nixon, 2015). No marked differences exist in the fracture connectivity between domains I and II, but the two-peak orientation cluster of the ~NW-SE fractures in domain II clearly indicate the dominance of Set 5 fractures for domain II and also validates the subdivision between domains I and II. The connections per branches values between the neighboring sub-domains IIIa-d and IVa-b, located outside the major sinistral step-over (Fig. 9), show marked contrasts (value range 1.25\u20131.55; Fig. 11a). The exception is the similarity of sub-domains IIIa and b. However, Set 2 fractures in IIIa are continuous and penetrative, but in IIIb they are clearly spatially associated to the N-S faults in (App. 1). In general, there is a progressive increase of ~NW-SE (Set 2\u00a0+\u00a05) fractures from IIIb to IIId. In domains IVa and IVb the ~NE-SW and ~NW-SE fractures occur in approximately equal proportions and the two-peak orientation pattern of the NE-SW and NW-SE fractures in stereographic projections support the presence of two separate orthogonal pairs of fracture sets (regional Sets 4 & 5; syn-fault Sets 2 & 3; Fig. 11c). Fractures within all the defined domains are relatively clustered within the XYI-topology plot (Fig. 11b). Outliers include domains IVa,b and IIIb, which stand out through the relatively low proportion of Y-nodes, and domain V, with higher proportion of the Y-nodes. The orientation distributions of domains V, VI and VII clearly deviate from all the remaining domains and support the conducted domain subdivision.\nOur findings over the relationship of the faults and syn-fault fractures (Sections 4.2., 4.3.) are in line with increasing fracture frequency and increase heterogeneity of fracture densities towards the faults (Ostermeijer et al., 2020; Torabi et al., 2018). Our results further highlight that faults and synchronous fractures additionally provide a major contribution towards defining the patterns of the later-formed fractures, and hence the overall architecture of the brittle structures that developed in the initially isotropic crystalline crust.\n\n\n6.3\nRegional correlation\nThe strike-slip regime responsible for faulting described in this paper (Section 5.1.), characterized by NW-SE main principal stress component (\u03c31) is compatible with the stress field attributed to the sinistral slip along the N-S trending faults and the origin of the associated NNW-SSE trending fractures in the Helsinki region (Fig. 1; Elminen et al., 2008). No absolute timing constraints for these strike-slip faults are available, but they post-date the ductile dextral reactivation of the NE trending Porkkala-M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 shear zone (PMSZ; Fig. 1a), which is correlated with the crystallization of the 1.64\u00a0Ga (Vaasjoki, 1977) Obbn\u00e4s and Bodom Rapakivi plutons, (Elminen et al., 2008; Heeremans and Wijbrans, 1999; Kosunen, 1999). Potential association of the strike-slip zones of the Orrengrund-B\u00e5ks\u00f6ren area and the similarly oriented NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW trending polymetallic In-bearing greisen veins within the western parts of the Wiborg batholith (Broman et al., 2018; Valkama et al., 2016) points towards a timing around the end of the crystallization of the Wiborg batholith (1.62\u00a0Ga; R\u00e4m\u00f6 and Haapala, 2005). However, since structural characterisation of the polymetallic vein systems is unavailable, it is possible that these veins pre-date the strike-slip faults, and the two are instead associated to the same crustal-scale N-S trending weakness zones underlying the Wiborg Batholith (Korja and Heikkinen, 1995). It is also possible that coalescence of systematically arranged Mode I microcracks (Anders et al., 2014), unrecognized in field studies, defines a weakness orientation that controlled the growth of the recognized N-S faults.\nThe NW-SE extension at 1.56\u00a0Ga interpreted for the Olkiluoto area in SW Finland from diabase dykes and fault slip data (Fig. 1; Stage 3 by Mattila and Viola, 2014) is incompatible with the paleostress orientations responsible for strike-slip faulting of this study. However, eigenvector analysis of the 1.55\u20131.37\u00a0Ga, NNW-SSE and ENE-WSW trending greisen veins in the Olkiluoto area (Southwestern Finland) and opening of the approximately coeval NW-SE trending Satakunta graben (15\u00a0km NE of Eurajoki; Kohonen et al., 2003) point towards extensional to transtensional faulting with an NE-SW oriented \u03c33 roughly around 1.6\u20131.3\u00a0Ga (Mattila and Viola, 2014). Moreover, partitioning of the overall NE-SW extension during intracratonic Mesoproterozoic rifting has been discussed as a potential reason for the generation of the N-S and E-W trending belts of Rapakivi magmatism (Ripa and Stephens, 2020). As far as this work is concerned, NE-SW extension under an overall transtensional setting is compatible with the generation of the strike-slip faults of the Orrengrund-B\u00e5ks\u00f6ren area, and could also explain the extreme extent of the \u201cwide DZs\u201d associated with the N-S strike-slip faults (Section 5.1). However, better constraints for the fault timing are required.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n\u2022\nA set of approximately N-S trending, dominantly sinistral sub-vertical strike-slip faults transect the ca. 1.65\u00a0Ga Rapakivi granites in Loviisa, southern Finland\n\n\n\u2022\nWell-developed fault damage zones indicate i) limited offsets (<20\u00a0cm) along the faults, preserving structures related to the incipient stage of faulting, and ii) fault-generation in mesoscopically isotropic material devoid of any pre-existing fabrics\n\n\n\u2022\nTwo sets of mutually synchronous regional fractures post-date the faults and the kinematically linked syn-fault extension fractures\n\n\n\u2022\nFault evolution defines four separate but partially overlapping features which collectively govern the character of fractures of the study area.

Of particular importance is the intensity of the fault-stage structures which inhibited the development of the sub-parallel NNW-SSE trending Set 5 regional structures, best exemplified within an approximately 300 m-scale step-over between segments of sinistral faults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","135":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAccording to the literature, deep geothermal energy reserves are associated with naturally fractured\/faulted reservoirs in various geological contexts (Meixner et al., 2016; Aliyu and Chen, 2018; Torabi et al., 2019). Opening-mode fractures and faults, with associated dilatant parts and damage zones, provide permeability that may constitute flow pathways, especially in low-porosity crystalline rocks, such as in granite (Barton et al., 1995; Caine et al., 1996; Caine and Forster, 1999; Callahan et al., 2019; Hollingworth et al., 2019; and references therein). Fluid flow through faults or fractures is possible due to contrasts in hydraulic conductivity with the surrounding low porosity rock matrix (Gentier et al., 2000). However, the hydraulic conductivity changes with time due to fluid\/rock interactions and regional deformation history (e.g. Callahan et al., 2019). Therefore, understanding fracture pattern geometry and its alteration is a major issue in the hydrogeology of fractured reservoirs (Laubach et al., 2019; Gentier et al., 2000).\nFluid-rock interactions lead to chemical changes, mineral dissolution\/precipitation and to changes of rock physical properties and strength including fracture growth, shear and linkage, inducing an increasing complexity of the fault zone (Dimmen et al., 2017; Heap et al., 2017; Laubach et al., 2019; Callahan et al., 2020a,b). Field and experimental studies have shown that fluid\/rock interactions depend on fluid and rock chemistries and pressure-temperature conditions (e.g. Laubach et al., 2019). The effects of temperature can be marked at shallow (less than 3\u00a0km) depths under the elevated heat flow circumstances of hydrothermal conditions (e.g. Callahan et al., 2020a,b; Dr\u00fcppel et al., 2020; and references therein). Such conditions can lead to either alteration-weakening, favoring by thin clay-rich low-permeability fault cores, or precipitation-strengthening, favored by thick stiff low-permeability fault cores (Solum et al., 2010; Callahan et al., 2020a,b). These effects can vary along individual faults and between faults in a set depending on local geochemical circumstances governed, for example, by host rock composition (Laubach et al., 2014).\nIn the light of these recent investigations, we examine how fluid-rock interactions and regional tectonics affected the fracture network architecture and its evolution along the transition between the Hercynian granitic basement and the Permian arkosic cover, which constitute a geothermal reservoir at depth within the Rhine Graben exploited at Rittershoffen (Vidal et al., 2017), Landau (Hettkamp et al., 2013) and Insheim (Baumg\u00e4rtner et al., 2013).\nOur study aims at defining the major parameters that control the efficiency of a fracture network for the flow of geothermally significant fluid, based on an analogue of the deep-seated geothermal reservoir, where we lead:\n\n1)\na description of the fracture network including fracture orientation measurements, abundance (density), spatial distribution, microstructures, and deformation style;\n\n\n2)\na mineralization and mineral deposit timing analysis; and\n\n\n3)\na study of porosity and evidence of fluid\/rock interactions at the fracture\/fault scale.\n\n\n\nThrough measuring fractures and characterizing wall rock alteration and mineral fill, we propose a model of the quarry-scale fracture network that integrates fluid circulation related to the geological history. We show that a previously unrecognized fault is present, that constitutes a hydraulic drain, and three stages of circulation have existed within this fault since the beginning of its history.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRhine graben context\nThe Upper Rhine Graben (URG) is part of the European Cenozoic Rift System, which extends from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 1\n-A; Illies, 1972; Ziegler, 1992; Schumacher, 2002; Ziegler and D\u00e8zes, 2005). This extensional structure is bounded by faults that crosscut both Permo-Triassic sandstones and Hercynian basement rocks (Schellschmidt and Clauser, 1996; Pribnow and Schellschmidt, 2000; Baillieux et al., 2013). Tertiary (500\u20131000\u00a0m thick) and Quaternary sediments filling the graben overly Jurassic (about 150m thick) and Triassic (about 700m thick) sediments and the Paleozoic crystalline basement (Rotstein et al., 2006). The URG, which formed after the Eocene in a weakened region, as a result of a thinned crust and an abnormal geothermal gradient, exhibits a vertical downward displacement of approximately 4\u00a0km (Illies, 1972; Illies and Greiner, 1978; Ziegler and D\u00e8zes, 2005). Thermal anomalies in the URG are widely interpreted to be the result of large-scale natural convective circulation loops of up to 3 000m height (Le Carlier et al., 1992; Vallier et al., 2019). The Hercynian basement and the Permo-Triassic cover crop out along the eastern and western graben shoulders (Illies, 1972; Walter et al., 2015), which were uplifted as the graben subsided (Schweizer and Kraatz, 1982; Ziegler, 1992).\nThe Hercynian basement of the URG consists of three major tectonic terranes, trending NE to NNE, and named from north to south: the Rhenohercynian, the Saxothuringian, and the Moldanubian (Fig. 1-B; Edel and Weber, 1995; Ziegler, 1992; Edel and Schulmann, 2009). These terranes crop out in the Vosges Massif and in the Black Forest Massif on the western and the eastern sides of the URG respectively. Successive generations of Carboniferous granitoids were emplaced into these terranes in a NE to NNE direction along primary weakness zones such as collisional or shear zones (Edel and Fluck, 1989). These granitoids exhibit a wide petrological and geochemical diversity, from a variety of deep magmatic sources (Altherr et al., 1999, 2000; Edel and Schulmann, 2009; Skrzypek et al., 2014; Skrzypek, 2016).\nThe Rhine Graben rifting has produced elevated temperatures (thermal anomalies) that reach temperatures of 100\u2013150 degrees C at depths of as little as 1\u00a0km, suitable for economic exploitation of geothermal resources. However thermal anomalies along the graben are spatially restricted (length and width ca. 10\u00a0km\u201330\u00a0km) and their intensity varies significantly (90\u2013130 degree C at 1500m depth) throughout the region (Hurter et al., 2003; Freymark et al., 2017). Contrasts between low permeability host rocks and observations of enhance flow in fault rocks shows that this regional heterogeneity is closely related to the capacity of rift-flank faults to support fluid circulation at the crustal scale by hydraulic connections from the crystalline basement to the overlying sedimentary basin (Le Carlier et al., 1992; Cathelineau and Boiron, 2010; Sanjuan et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.2\nThe Saint Pierre Bois quarry site\nIn order to understand the Permian cover\/Hercynian basement transition as deep geothermal reservoirs, it is essential to use outcrops as analogues (Ukar et al., 2019). In the rift-flanks, in the Vosges and Black Forest massifs, few outcrops allow access to this transition zone. The Saint Pierre Bois quarry is a suitable analogue because it shares the same structural setting and geology of those reached by the boreholes within the Rhine Graben. Additionally, the rocks have mineral deposits and alteration typical of rocks exposed to a hydrothermal activity. Further the three quarry walls provide a 3D picture of the fracture network in both the basement and the overlying sedimentary cover, and of the structural connectivity between them.\nThe Saint Pierre Bois quarry is located on the western graben shoulder margin, in the Vill\u00e9 basin, in the northern part of the central Vosges (Fig. 1). The Vill\u00e9 basin is bounded by major faults that have more than 100\u00a0m of displacements: the Lalaye-Lubine (LL) fault zone to the north (400\u00a0m fault throw at the Col de Fourchy, Blanalt et al., 1972), the Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (SMM) fault zone striking N30\u00b0E to the west, and the N\u2013S Vosgian fault to the east (Fig. 1-B). These major faults created a weak crustal domain where the Vill\u00e9 basin (Fig. 1-C) developed during the Permian (Saalian phase) and Triassic and led to basin subsidence in the Miocene during formation of the Rhine graben (Laubacher and von Eller, 1966; Blanalt et al., 1972). The basin hosts a number of secondary smaller horst and graben structures (Blanalt et al., 1972). The Vill\u00e9 Basin was filled with detrital and volcanic-detrital sediments (Laubacher and von Eller, 1966), including Stephanian arkoses and several stages of Permian fluvial filling interrupted by a period of lacustrine sedimentation (Carasco, 1989).\nThe Saint Pierre Bois quarry, currently exploited for aggregate, is located more precisely along the border of the Dambach-Scherwiller granite, which constitutes a horst within the Vill\u00e9 basin (Fig. 1-C). This granite is related to the generation of S-type two mica leucogranites (\u2018Thannenkirch-Br\u00e9zouard-Bilstein\u2019) that were emplaced as an elongated pluton along major crustal faults during the late Carboniferous magmatic event in the Central Vosges (Skrzypek et al., 2014; Skrzypek, 2016). These magmatic plutons were intruded 322\u2013330\u00a0Ma ago (Boutin et al., 1995; Schulmann et al., 2002; Edel et al., 2007; Kratinov\u00e1 et al., 2007; Tabaud et al., 2014). In the quarry, a layer of Stephanian arkose including granite clasts overlies the Hercynian granite. The arkose layer thickness does not exceed 15\u00a0m within the Vill\u00e9 basin (Laubacher and von Eller, 1966) and is 1\u20135\u00a0m in the quarry (Fig. 2\n-B).\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nFracture network parameters\nIn the whole paper, the term fracture groups opening-mode fractures and faults in general and particularly if we cannot distinguish a displacement. We use the term fault if we showed a displacement along the surface.\nThe spatial arrangement of a fracture network is a fundamental attribute to characterize (Laubach et al., 2018). Spatial arrangement includes the spacing patterns of fractures (e.g. random, regularly spaced, clustered) and the configuration of the parts of the network (size, strike dispersion, and connectivity). The distribution of fracture orientations (strike and dip) and connectivity (abutment, cross-cut, and type of termination) influences connected flow pathways (Long and Witherspoon, 1985) if the fractures are open.\nAdditionally, other key fracture parameters needed to understand likely flow pathways include fracture abundance in terms of size and number, population of apertures (dilations, fill), and mineral fill composition, distribution, and timing. The degree to which fractures become sealed depends on a number of factors including temperature conditions, geochemical environment, fluid flow patterns, fracture size, and when and how fast fractures opened (Laubach et al., 2019 and references therein).\nTo characterize arrangement, we used the scanline method (Priest and Hudson, 1981; Sanderson and Peacock, 2019). For each fracture, we measured orientation and position of the fracture intersection with the line, aperture and fill geometry and composition.\nFracture orientations for each scanline were plotted in rose diagrams and equal-area, lower-hemisphere stereonets to identify orientation modes that were used to define fracture sets. Having the orientation of a scanline, the set orientations, and the position of scanline intersections for each set, the spacing between fractures of each set has been adjusted by applying the Terzaghi correction (Terzaghi, 1965) (1).\n\n(1)\nSc = Sm * sin\u00a0\u03b1\n\nWhere Sc is the corrected spacing, Sm is the measured spacing, and \u03b1 is the acute angle between the scanline and the average orientation of the fracture set.\nFor each set, stick plots and cumulative frequency diagrams were used to analyze spatial distribution (Gillespie et al., 1999; Sanderson et al., 2019). Moreover, to quantify fracture distribution along the scanline, a coefficient of variation Cv was computed. This coefficient corresponds to a dimensionless value of spacing variation (Gillespie et al., 1999) (2).\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nC\nV\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nS\n\nS\n\n\n\n\nwhere C\n\nV\n\n, \u03c3\n\nS\n\n, S are coefficient of variation, standard deviation of spacing between fractures, and mean spacing, respectively. This value provides an indication of the fracture distribution: C\n\nV\n\u00a0<\u00a01 indicates regularly spaced fractures whereas a C\n\nV\n\u00a0>\u00a01 is characteristic of fractures that are more irregularly spaced and Cv\u00a0=\u00a01 expected for random distribution (Sanderson et al., 2019) and perhaps clustered (Gillespie et al., 1993).\nFractures that are anomalously closely spaced have been called corridors (e.g. Questiaux et al., 2010). Random spacing can result in clustering. We identified corridors qualitatively and by using high Cv values although we note that methods exist that can separate patterns where clustering is more pronounced than random patterns and those that are not (Marrett et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019).\n\n\n3.2\nPetrological characterization\nPetrological characterization of rock samples was undertaken based on polished thin section analyses using a combination of optical and scanning electron microscopy. An Olympus BH2 polarising light microscope was used to observe thin sections. A Tescan Mira 3 XMU scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with an EDS EDAX TEAM system and an APOLLO XPP silicon drift detector at 25\u00a0kV, was used for further investigations at high magnification.\nChemical spot analyses of silicates were performed using an electron microprobe with an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV, a beam current of 12\u00a0nA, a 1\u00a0\u03bcm beam width and a counting time of 10\u00a0s. Ca, K, Na, Mg, Si, Al, S and Fe were analyzed. Ca-Ka and K-Ka were monitored with a LPET crystal, Na-Ka and Mg-Ka on a LTAP crystal, Si-Ka and Al- Ka on a TAP crystal, S-Ka on a PET crystal, Fe-Ka on a LLiF crystal. Chemical spot analyses of alumino-phosphate-sulfates were performed using electron microprobe with an accelerating voltage of 20\u00a0kV, a beam current of 40\u00a0nA, a 1\u00a0\u03bcm beam width and a counting time of 10\u00a0s. Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Fe, Mn, Zr, La, Ce, Th, U, Ba, Sr and As were analyzed. Standards included both well characterized natural minerals and synthetic oxides. Matrix corrections were made with the ZAF software program (Merlet, 1994).\n\n\n3.3\nPorosity measurements\nIn the present work, four techniques were applied to different sample types to provide porosity data in the fracture network and granite wall rock. The triple-weighing method was used to measure the porosity of interconnected pores (intergranular and fracture porosity) for large samples (up to 3.5\u00a0kg) along and in corridors. This method consists of drying the sample under vacuum at 105\u00a0\u00b0C, saturating the sample with water under vacuum, and weighing both the dry and saturated samples in air and submerged in water.\nPrior to analysis, vacuum or flow degassing removed moisture from the porous rock. To establish the relationship between texture and porosity, helium pycnometry was applied to small sub-samples of the large samples collected from corridors. Helium pycnometry measures the true bulk density, because helium can enter even the smallest voids or pores. Mercury porosimetry was used to measure pore volume, pore size distribution, and bulk and apparent densities. During porosity analysis in the mercury porosimetry analyser, increasing pressure was applied to forcefully intrude mercury into the smallest pores. Pore size distributions ranging from 4\u00a0nm (pressure\u00a0=\u00a0400\u00a0MPa) up to\u00a0~\u00a0800\u00a0\u03bcm (vacuum) can be measured.\nDigital image processing applied to back-scattered electron (BSE) images obtained with scanning electron microscopy was used to quantify total porosity and feldspar dissolution porosity, to measure pore size distribution, and to complement the other techniques with textural and spatial information about porosity (Cardell et al., 2002). Total porosity corresponds to an average value of ten porosity measurements on ten separated low-magnification BSE images (9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0mm), using the Image J software (Rotevatn et al., 2016). Feldspar dissolution porosity was estimated by measuring porosity on most of the feldspar grains observed in five high magnification images (1.36\u00d7 1.02\u00a0mm). Taking account of the feldspar grain size, the number of grains measured in thin section is around 20.\n\n\n3.4\nGeochemistry\n\n3.4.1\nTrace elements in quartz\nAnalyses of trace elements in quartz were performed using a UVl laser-ablation microsampler CETAC\u00ae Excite (193\u00a0nm) coupled to a ThermoScientific\u00ae X series II quadrupole plasma mass spectrometer at the BRGM laboratory in Orleans, according to the laser configuration of Monnier et al. (2018). The analytical protocol involved combinations of: 7Li, 23Na, 24Mg, 27Al, 29Si, 39K, 45Sc, 48Ti, 51V, 52Cr, 56Fe, 74Ge, 75As, 85Rb, 93Nb, 118Sn, 121Sb, 139La, 175Lu, 181Ta, 182W, 208Pb. Ablation spots 85\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter were performed at 8\u00a0Hz frequency with energy of ~2\u00a0J\/cm2. Analysis time for each spot was 60\u00a0s, including 20\u00a0s of background measurement with the laser off and 40\u00a0s of analysis time with the laser on. Quantification was performed with Glitter\u00ae software. All data were calibrated against the external standard NIST SRM 612, and the internal standard of the Si value (4.65\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0ppm\u00a0=\u00a0stoichiometric concentration of Si in quartz). Absolute concentrations were calculated in quartz samples using NIST concentration values given in Pearce et al. (1997).\n\n\n3.4.2\nU\u2013Th measurements\nIron hydroxides analyzed for U\u2013Th were dissolved in a HCl 6N\u2013HNO3 7N mixture. U and Th were measured on a Neptune MC-ICP-MS equipped with a RPQ filter. The 232Th isotope was measured using a Faraday cage, whereas 230Th was measured on an ion counter. The measured values were corrected with certified standards. Blanks are 10\u00a0pg for U and 300\u00a0pg for Th. Further details on analytical techniques are available in Innocent et al. (2005) and Millot et al. (2011).\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nDescription of the quarry and fractures observed\nThe Saint Pierre Bois quarry covers a surface area of around 5\u00a0ha with a 40\u00a0m-high wall providing access to two around 15\u00a0m-high operating levels (305\u00a0m and 320\u00a0m ASL) on the north side and a large operating platform (level 295\u00a0m ASL) on the east (Fig. 2-A). Level 320\u00a0m currently has a N140\u00b0E wall at the north, called upper wall N140\u00b0E (UW140), which is extended by a N250\u00b0E wall, called upper wall N250\u00b0E (UW250). Level 305\u00a0m has a N140\u00b0E wall at the north, called lower wall N140\u00b0E (LW140), which continues as a N25\u00b0E wall along the northwest, called lower wall N25\u00b0E (LW25).\nOn UW140, LW140 (Fig. 2-B) and UW250 (Fig. 2-C), the Dambach leucogranite occurs as a coarse-grained pink to reddish and stiff granite. A stockwork of decameter-to meter-thick pink aplite and pegmatite intruded the leucogranite, largely visible on UW140 and LW140 (Fig. 2-B). Around 5\u00a0m of Stephanian sediments, including microconglomerates and arkoses, cover the leucogranite on the western part of the UW140 (Fig. 2-B).\nThe quarry rocks are not all equally altered and alteration of granite is marked by color changes. On LW25, the leucogranite has lost its pristine magmatic coarse-grained texture due to alteration and its color evolved from pink-reddish in fresh rock to whitish\/yellowish color in altered rock (Fig. 2-G). At the south of UW250, active quarrying in 2012 progressively revealed an intensely fractured and yellowish\/whitish altered leucogranite overlain by altered Stephanian sediments (Fig. 2-D, E, F).\nThe granitic basement is highly fractured. It is not always too easy to distinguish pre-existing naturally occurring fractures from those induced by blasting during the quarrying. We call the naturally occurring features \u2018tectonic fractures\u2019 in that they are either faults or are primarily associated with faults. The blast fractures are short (less than 1\u00a0m), totally scattered (wide orientation dispersion), generally located inside the blocks delineated by tectonic fractures, and do not show any displacement or fill. In contrast, tectonic fractures in the granite have cataclastic textures on their walls, hydrothermal alteration and\/or mineral deposits. No opening has been observed on these fractures. Faults are also observed among fractures. The displacement size of faults is challenging to measure in the generally featureless granitic rocks. For the larger ones that cross the sediment-basement transition, we estimated offsets based on the displacement of the arkose layer.\nA dozen of E-W opening-mode fractures and small-displacement faults having trace lengths of several meters or more are present along both levels UW140 and LW140. These fractures appear to be regularly spaced (Fig. 2-B). Most of the E-W fractures that crosscut the granite terminate at the sedimentary cover, but several (around 20 percent) cross the interface and some of them (around 20 percent) are faults that show normal (around 1\u00a0m; Fig. 2-B and D) or shear (slickensides) displacement. On the E-W-striking faults, only five present slickensides. Plunges are 15\u00b0\u201340\u00b0 to the west. Based on local crystallization in irregularities, all show dextral move. Evidence of dextral strike-slip movement sense has also been observed on three N130\u00b0E fault surfaces. Only one N15\u00b0E plane shows evidence of sinistral movement.\nExcept for the E-W faults, which cross between quarry walls and therefore have map-view trace lengths of at least 20\u00a0m, fracture length is challenging to measure accurately. Based on limited trace length exposures, we infer that most have lengths of less than 10m.\nZones of anomalously closely spaced fractures (corridors) are dispersed throughout the quarry. Spacing outside corridors is typically 10\u201350\u00a0m. Spacing within corridors ranges from 5\u00a0cm to 3\u00a0m. On UW250, a 2\u20133m thick fracture corridor with high density (spacing 1\u20135\u00a0cm) of N15\u00b0E parallel fracture is present at the beginning of the scanline (Fig. 2-C). The granite shows cataclastic textures. This type of corridor is also present in other places in the quarry, but these corridors are narrower, typically only about 5\u201310\u00a0cm thick.\nMineral deposits associated with fractures and faults vary along their traces. Reddish and green coatings are present on most of the fault surfaces (>90%). Centimetric barite and quartz deposits have been only observed on a same E-W fault crossing UW140 and LW140 (Fig. 2-B). On LW25, an E-W fault with compact breccia of cm-sized clasts in a cataclastic matrix separates two blocks with a several-meters offset (Fig. 2-G). At the north-east, E-W faults also cross a N25\u00b0E fault surface, and slightly offset the different blocks (<1\u00a0m). This N25\u00b0E surface constitutes a large fracture in the same direction as the N25\u00b0E-striking quarry wall. The fault facilitates quarrying. The fault is also present above at the quarry floor (295\u00a0m ASL), where iron oxides and hydroxides are present on the fault surface.\n\n\n4.2\nFracture network in granite\n\n4.2.1\nFracture orientations\nTwo main sets of fractures in granite have been identified. F1 strikes N90\u00b0E\u00b120\u00b0 and most fractures are nearly vertical. F2 strikes N30\u00b0E\u00b120\u00b0 and dips 55\u00b0 to SE (Fig. 3\n-E). The relative ages of the two sets based on crossing and abutting relations is F1 before F2.\nAlthough two-dimensional maps have many advantages for fracture pattern characterization (e.g. Rauch et al., 2019), the configuration of our quarry exposure mandated 1D scanline measurements. Sampling bias, such as undersampling due to being less perpendicular and more parallel to the line, can be minimized for scanlines by collecting multiple measurements in different orientations (Pickering et al., 1995; Davy et al., 2006; Bertrand et al., 2018).\nTherefore, we performed several scanline analyses along two perpendicular directions, NE-SW and NW-SE, on the four accessible quarry walls: UW140, UW250, LW25, LW140 (Fig. 2-A). The two NW-SE scanlines (UW140 and LW140) are located at different levels, making it possible to estimate the vertical extent of the fractures.\nA total of 229 fracture orientations were measured (Table 1\n). On the N25\u00b0E and N140\u00b0E walls (LW25, LW140 and UW140), the most abundant fracture set is oriented N90\u00b0E\u00b110\u00b0 dipping steeply (60\u201390\u00b0) north and south (Fig. 3 A, B, C; F1 in Table 1). On LW25, the dips are equally distributed to north and south, whereas on LW140 and UW140 most fractures dip to the south. A second set, oriented N20\u00b0E-N40\u00b0E is present, dipping approximately 55\u00b0 to the SE (Fig. 3 A, B, C; F2 in Table 1). On UW250, the main fracture set is oriented N10\u00b0E-N20\u00b0E. The E-W set is also present but is less presented due to the high fracture density within the fracture corridor (Fig. 2-C).\nFor all scanline directions, the fracture patterns are equivalent in terms of orientation (share common strike), whereas the density of each set varies. This suggests that our sampling is appropriate and spacing is not distorted by sampling bias.\n\n\n4.2.2\nSpatial distribution\nSpatial analysis is summarized in Table 1. Fracture frequency is approximately 0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 fr\/m, except for the UW250 scanline, which shows a higher fracture frequency, approximately 1 fr\/m.\nIdeally, spacing between two parallel fractures should be measured perpendicular to fracture orientation. To correct spacing values for non-orthogonal fractures, the Terzagi correction has been applied (Table 1). For F1, the mean corrected spacing is 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6m. The mean spacing of F2 is more scattered and varies between 0.4m and 5.74m. The lowest value can be explain by the low angle between the average direction of the fracture set (N30\u00b0E) and the scanline direction (N25\u00b0E). In this case, the scanline direction is not favorable to sample the F2 fractures.\nThe coefficient of variation (Cv) is around 1 except for F1 along UW140 and F2 along UW250. To better discriminate fracture organization, we used the 95% confidence interval of Cv values for random arrangements based on Monte Carlo simulations (Hooker et al., 2018). Following this approach, the F1 set shows a random arrangement along LW25 and LW140, the lower wall, a clustered arrangement along UW140, and a regular arrangement along UW250 (Table 1). In contrast, fractures of F2 set are randomly spaced along LW140 and UW140, and clustered along LW25 and UW250 (Table 1).\nFracture distributions are presented in Fig. 4\n. Examining the LW25 scanline from left to right shows regular fracture distribution at the beginning, then increased frequency (a cluster), followed by a regular distribution (Fig. 4-A). Four intervals have a slope higher than 2 and indicate fracture clusters (Fig. 4-A). The two first clusters, around 10m and 30m, are made up of fractures from both sets, whereas the other two, around 90m and 110\u2013120m, are mainly defined by fractures of the F1 set. (Fig. 4-A).\nAlong the LW140 scanline, a high fracture density zone is present at the beginning of the profile and in the central part, around 25m, mainly made up of fractures of the F1 set (Fig. 4-B). Between these fracture clusters, the fracture distribution is regular, but large intervals have no fractures of the F1 and F2 sets, between 12m and 25m and 25m and 35m respectively (Fig. 4-B). These intervals correspond to the stockwork of aplite and pegmatite intruded into the Dambach leucogranite.\nFour fracture clusters are also present in the UW140 scanline around 15m, 45m, 60m and 75m, which correspond to an increase of the number of fractures included mainly in the F1 fracture set (Fig. 4-C).\nAlong the UW250 scanline, the shortest, three fracture clusters are clearly visible at the beginning of the scanline, around 8m and 17m respectively (Fig. 4-D). The first and the third clusters are mainly constituted of F2 fractures and the second cluster by fractures not included in the F1 and F2 sets.\nAlong the UW140, the E-W traces are easy to detect. Trace spacing is regular and the analysis of their distribution shows an average spacing of approximately 11m. The Cv is 0.34, which confirms the regular distribution of these large E-W faults, which cross all the walls in the quarry (Fig. 2-B).\n\n\n4.2.3\nFracture fill and wall rock alteration\nThe least altered and deformed granite present on UW140 and LW140 that can be considered as a reference for the Dambach granite, is coarse-grained pink to reddish and stiff. It consists of quartz (~40\u00a0wt%), K-feldspar (~25\u201330\u00a0wt%), plagioclase (~25\u201330\u00a0wt%) with biotite and muscovite. Primary K-feldspar, plagioclase and muscovite are typically preserved (>95%) Less than 5% of K-feldspar grains and plagioclase core grains are slightly altered into illite-mica. Plagioclase rims consist of albite that shows a green color in cathodoluminescence. Less than 20% of flakes of brown biotite remain well preserved, other flakes show greenish rims with hematite. Less than 1% of flakes are altered to clay minerals (illite) with titanium oxides and iron hydroxides.\nThe granite samples 7 and 8 taken out of the faults on the UW140 and LW140 are fractured and brecciated (Fig. 2-A, B). In sample 7, millimeter-to cm-sized blocks of microfractured and deformed granite are separated by heterogeneously crushed granite, indicating a protocataclastic texture. Biotite and feldspars are slightly altered (<5%) in the largest blocks, while in the crushed granite, biotite is transformed to illite-smectite mixed layers and iron hydroxides, or chlorite, illite and hematite, plagioclase are replaced by illite and K-feldspar is partially dissolved and cemented by quartz. In sample 8, a 1\u00a0cm-thick cohesive cataclasite is in contact with a zone of heterogeneous brittle deformation (Fig. 5\n-a, b, c) that transitions between cataclasite (Fig. 5-c), protocataclasite (Fig. 5-d), and altered granite (Fig. 5-e). The cohesive cataclasite is made of <50\u00a0\u03bcm-sized mineral clasts (essentially quartz (>95%) with minor preserved K-feldspar and plagioclase) cemented by silica\/microquartz and minor illite (Fig. 5-c).\nIn contrast granite samples in the eastern part of the quarry have a whitish\/yellowish aspect due to advanced alteration of biotite and feldspars (Fig. 2-A, D, E, F). Biotite is generally altered to clay minerals (illite-smectite mixed layers) with titanium oxides (>99%), while plagioclase grains are intensely altered into clays (kaolinite\/illite-smectite mixed layers) and impregnated with iron hydroxides, and feldspar grains are altered into clay mineral.\n\n4.2.3.1\nFault rocks\nTo document mineral deposits and textures in EW-striking fractures, six samples were collected (Fig. 2-A).\nThe coating of sample 1 is a 2-3\u00a0cm-thick cohesive cataclasite intersected in its length by a ~0.5\u00a0mm-thick opening-mode fracture (Fig. 6\n-a, b). The cement of cohesive cataclasite is silica\/microquartz with minor illite. The opening-mode fracture is lined by inward-facing euhedral quartz and sealed by anhedral barite (Fig. 6-b, d). Quartz grains are ~100\u00a0\u03bcm-sized. The cohesive cataclasite is in contact with altered granite matrix affected by a low-density network of microfractures subparallel to the cataclasite. Microfractures are filled with radial fibers of iron-hydroxides sealed by microquartz with minor illite (Fig. 6-g). Biotite has altered to illite with titanium oxides and hematite (Fig. 6-c). K-feldspar and plagioclase grains are partially dissolved (Fig. 6-e). Quartz partially fills K-feldspar porosity, while illite and \u03bcm-sized aluminum-phosphate-sulfate (APS) minerals fill plagioclase porosity (Fig. 6-f).\nThe coating of sample 2a is a 4-5\u00a0cm-thick cohesive cataclasite in contact with a highly deformed and altered granite (Fig. 6-h). A ~1\u00a0cm-thick opening-mode fracture intersects the cohesive cataclasite in its length (Fig. 6-j). The opening-mode fracture is lined by well-crystallized hematite and euhedral quartz, and sealed by anhedral barite (Fig. 6-j). The altered granite is formed of micro-domains of folded quartz and clasts of identifiable granite separated by microfractures sub-parallel to the cataclasite (Fig. 6-h). The microfractures are sealed by microquartz and iron hydroxides. In granite clasts, clay minerals (illite-smectite mixed layers) and iron-hydroxides replace deformed flakes of biotite (Fig. 6-i). K-feldspar and plagioclase grains are intensely dissolved and replaced by clay minerals.\nThe coating of sample 3 is a 2-3\u00a0cm-thick almost friable cataclasite of granite cemented by iron-hydroxides with minor microquartz. The alteration of the granite matrix is very similar to that of granite clasts in sample 2.\nThe breccia of sample 4 consists of mm-sized clasts of microbreccia\/cataclasite cemented by microquartz with iron hydroxides and minor illite (Fig. 5-f, g, h, i). A medium-sized quartz fills residual porosity and microfractures that intersect the breccia in its length (Fig. 5-i). No preserved granite matrix was observed at this site.\nThe breccia of samples 5 and 6 essentially consist of clasts of granite, mineral grains and cataclasite that are partially cemented by microquartz with minor iron hydroxides and illite, then euhedral quartz and barite (Fig. 7\n-a, b, c, d). The size of clasts varies widely, from several centimeters to a micron. In the two samples, a part of the porosity is related to two sets of opening-mode fractures (Fig. 7-c). Microfractures sub-parallel to fractures crosscut the minerals especially the longest ones, while the smallest ones follow intergrain boundaries. Some microfractures are not continuous but extend as planes of secondary fluid inclusions that are easily visible in deformed primary quartz. Mineral fillings in microfractures are similar to those present in cataclasite and breccia, i.e. essentially quartz with minor clay minerals and iron hydroxides. However, at the micron scale, it is difficult to distinguish the quartz cement from micron-sized quartz clasts. Euhedral quartz partially deposited on the walls of residual macroporosity, while late millimetric to centimetric barite only seals up part of the porosity at intersections of fractures with almost the same direction but various dip. In the sample 6, an early 2\u00a0cm-thick cohesive cataclasite shows two zones: 1) a reddish one that is essentially cemented by iron hydroxides with minor microquartz and 2) an indurated orange one cemented by silica\/microquartz (Fig. 7-a, f, g). Residual macroporosity along cataclasite partially filled with euhedral quartz forms mm-to cm-sized geodes.\nThe granite clasts of the breccia and the granite matrix of breccia walls are intensely altered. A mixing of clay minerals (illite-smectite mixed layers) and iron-hydroxides replace rare biotite flakes (<5%) and a part of primary muscovite (Fig. 7-h), while K-feldspar and plagioclase grains are intensely dissolved and replaced by clay minerals (illite, illite-smectite mixed layers) and microquartz (Fig. 7-i). APS minerals are associated with illite in porosity of plagioclase dissolution. The average chemical formula of APS in granite (sample 1 and sample 5), as measured by electron microprobe, is:\n\n(Pb0.22Ce0.30Sr0.24La0.14Ca0.13) (Al0.9 Fe0.1) (PO4)1.30(SO4)0.14(AsO4)0.27(SiO4)0.22 (OH)6\n\n\n\n\nCentimeters distant from the breccia, some biotite flakes (<5%) are altered to clay minerals (illite) with titanium oxides and iron hydroxides, while others exhibit greenish rims with hematite.\n\n\n4.2.3.2\nMineral sequence\nAccording to the macroscopic and microscopic observations, cement of cohesive cataclasites is silica\/microquartz. The reddish color is mainly due to the abundance of iron hydroxides, whereas the greenish color is attributed to variable amounts of illite particles. Hematite, euhedral quartz then barite are more rarely present as mineral fills of opening-mode fractures intersecting cataclasite in their length or of residual macroporosity in breccia. Common alteration observed in the granite walls is marked by partial dissolution of K-feldspar and plagioclase, impregnation of plagioclase porosity by iron hydroxides, kaolinite then illite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0APS\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz, quartz filling in porosity of K-feldspar porosity and replacement of biotite by illite\u00a0+\u00a0chlorite\u00a0+\u00a0hematite and\/or illite-smectite mixed layers\u00a0+\u00a0iron hydroxides.\nAll the mineral fillings in fractures and associated alterations are not contemporaneous, but precipitated from fluids present at different times in the porosity of the fracture network and the connected matrix porosity. The textural relationships between phases are informative of the relative chronology of the mineral fills and alterations (Table 2).\nThe iron hydroxides fill in porosity of plagioclase dissolution in granite matrix indicates that plagioclase dissolution is earlier than iron hydroxides formation. In the same way, a large part of iron hydroxides in fractures and matrix porosity are overlapped and cemented by microquartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0illite, indicating that precipitation of iron hydroxides is earlier than formation of microquartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0illite.\nThe opening-mode fractures affect the cohesive cataclasite, and are consequently later. The overlapping relations between hematite, euhedral quartz and barite filling fractures indicate that hematite and quartz precipitated first, possibly as the fracture opened. The fracture was subsequently filled with barite. Euhedral quartz in residual porosity of breccia precipitated probably contemporaneously of quartz in opening-mode fractures and in porosity of K-feldspar dissolution. Iron hydroxides associated with clays (illite-smectite mixed layers, kaolinite) are assumed to be associated with present-day weathering. The table summarizes the succession of mineral fills with time (Table 2\n).\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nFracture networks in arkose and diagenesis\n\n4.3.1\nFractures in arkose\nThe arkose contains fractures, but the layer is not easily accessible, limiting the observations and measurements (Fig. 2-B). Fractures are not mineral filled but show protocataclase. As the layer is eroded, the length of fractures is not possible to estimate. Most of them stop at the lower sediment limit (with the granite), but some continue in the granite. These constitute the E-W fault (Fig. 2-B).\nAs the accessibility is difficult, only nine fracture orientations were measured. While a statistically minimal sample, inspection of the outcrop suggests these measurements are representative and provide some limited information about orientation modes for the fractures in the arkosic rocks. The primary set strikes N10\u00b0E\u00b110\u00b0 and the secondary set strikes N100\u00b0E\u00b110\u00b0 (Fig. 8\n). All fractures have steep dips, nearly vertical and normal to bed dip.\n\n\n4.3.2\nArkose diagenetic sequence\n\nKushnir et al. (2018) performed petrophysical measurements, including porosity, P-wave velocity, permeability, uniaxial compressive strength, and thermal properties, on twelve samples collected in the Saint Pierre Bois quarry. We used these samples, named SPB1 to SPB12, to complete the mineralogical observations of the arkose matrix.\nAll these arkose rocks have almost similar petrographic features. They are heterogranular medium to coarse-grained arkoses (Fig. 9\n). Detrital minerals consist of quartz (Qzd), plagioclase, and K-feldspar (Kfsd) grains, with minor phyllosilicates (<5%), including biotite, muscovite and clays, tourmaline, iron hydroxides, and heavy minerals such as zircon, apatite, ilmenite, titanium oxides, and monazite. Authigenic minerals are primarily quartz with minor K-feldspar (Kfs1), clay minerals including illite (Ill), APS minerals, galena and pyrite (Fig. 9). Pressure-solution features and a high degree of quartz recrystallization associated with deformation in presence of fluid commonly obliterate the pristine morphology of detrital quartz grains (Fig. 9a). However, rare preserved detrital quartz grains are generally sub-rounded to rounded based on the dust-lines that separate the detrital grain and quartz overgrowths.\nAt least two types of authigenic quartz are identified in all arkose samples (SPB2, Fig. 9a and b), based on their texture and relationships with other minerals:\n\n1)\nearly quartz aureoles (Qz1) growing in continuity with detrital quartz crystals, where most of these quartz aureoles have irregular edges suggesting dissolution\/recrystallization; and\n\n\n2)\nxenomorphic quartz fillings in intergranular spaces and a portion of secondary porosity related to feldspar dissolution (Qz2), where this quartz is the major type observed in arkose. Another generation of micron-to medium-grained quartz crystallized at arkose grain contacts (Qz3), corresponding to a protocataclastic texture. This latter was observed in samples SPB5 and SPB10 in the eastern part of the quarry (Fig. 9c).\n\n\n\nAbout 10% of detrital grains are albite-dominant plagioclase. Pure albite surrounds detrital grains. Most plagioclase grains are sericitized (oriented clay particles) or exhibit a high degree of dissolution (Fig. 9a). An unoriented Mg-rich clay mineral phase associated with micron-sized euhedral grains of APS and microquartz has partly filled dissolution porosity (Fig. 9d and e). X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe analysis of clay separates provide evidence of pure illite (supplementary data). The average chemical formula of APS measured by electron microprobe is:\n\n(Pb0.38Ce0.30Sr0.29La0.16Ca0.09) (Al0.9 Fe0.1) (PO4)1.30(SO4)0.15(AsO4)0.44(SiO4)0.11 (OH)6\n\n\n\n\nK-feldspar comprises about 15\u201320% of detrital grains and their Ba content as measured by electron microprobe reaches up to ~0.14\u00a0wt %, whereas the Ba content in authigenic K-feldspar is below the detection limit. Detrital K-feldspar grains have various morphologies from rounded to almost euhedral grains, suggesting that the source of detrital K-feldspar was not far from the sedimentation site. K-feldspar is more abundant than plagioclase. Its degree of alteration\/dissolution is also less than that of plagioclase, and even small euhedral authigenic K-feldspar is present on detrital grains (Fig. 9b). On the other hand, both authigenic and detrital K-feldspar grains provide evidence of dissolution, indicating that the dissolution process occurred later than authigenic K-feldspar cementation (Fig. 9b).\nDetrital ferromagnesian minerals are brownish to greenish biotite, muscovite, tourmaline, and probable cordierite. Muscovite and tourmaline are mostly preserved, whereas biotite was commonly transformed into chlorite or illite and iron hydroxides (Fig. 9h). Rare cordierite is transformed into fine-grained mixture of muscovite and chlorite.\nAmong accessory minerals, zircon, monazite and titanium oxides (Fig. 9d) are mostly preserved, whereas ilmenite exhibits a high degree of dissolution and is partially replaced by secondary titanium oxides. Several detrital titanium oxide grains in the arkose provide evidence of chemical zoning in backscattered electron image and tungsten was detected by EDS. Trace element analyses using an electron microprobe made it possible to detect the presence of Fe, Sc, Nb, Ta, Cr, W and Sn in various amounts. Secondary xenotime partially fills plagioclase porosity, along with illite and microquartz (Fig. 9f).\nIn a similar way as in granite, textural relationships between minerals described above enabled the relative chronology of mineral dissolution, alteration and precipitation (Table 3\n).\n\n\n\n4.4\nPorosity measurements\n\n4.4.1\nGranite\nUsing the triple-weighing method, we measured bulk porosity of eight granite samples, including the six specimens collected along the E-W trending fault and fracture surfaces (samples 1 to 6 described in the \u00a7 4.2.3), one in the brecciated granite (sample 7) and one in the unaltered granite (sample 9, Fig. 2-A) This rock has a low porosity of 2.62% (Table 4\n). By comparison, porosity values of breccias and cataclasites sampled in the six fracture and fault surfaces (sample 1 to 6) and brecciated granite (sample 7) are more heterogeneous in terms of porosity, ranging from 1.65 to 7.45% (Table 4).\nPorosities of cohesive cataclasites cemented by quartz (samples 1, 2 and 4) range between 1.65 and 2.62% (Table 4). The cataclasite cemented by iron hydroxides (sample 3) has a higher porosity of 5.73% (Table 4). Porosity in brecciated granite that shows protocataclastic texture (sample 7) is of 2.62% (Table 4). Porosities that are measured in breccia along the long fault surface (>30\u00a0m) crosscutting the sediment\/granite transition (samples 5 and 6) are 4.5 and 7.45% (Table 4). These values represent an average porosity of the reworked granite matrix (including breccia), barite filling, and cohesive cataclasite. The granite on the margins of the breccia in sample 5 has a matrix porosity of 5.73% (Table 4).\nCohesive cataclasite crosscutting the breccia in sample 6 was not large enough to measure porosity using the triple-weighing method, but large enough to measure He and Hg porosities successively. A slab of the cataclasite provided evidence of two zones, an external reddish area and an internal orange region (Fig. 7 f,g), which were analyzed separately. The reddish cataclasite zone, which is well cemented by iron hydroxides, has He porosity of 6.74%, whereas the orange zone, which is well cohesive cataclasite cemented by silica\/microquartz has He porosity of 2.13% (Table 4).\nMercury porosity measurements provide information on bulk porosity and pore size distribution (SD-porosity). The difference between the He and the Hg porosities, which corresponds to porosity attributed to pore sizes <3.67\u00a0nm, is estimated at 1.32% in the reddish part and 0.72% in the internal part. Pore sizes in both zones show a bimodal distribution with the same pore size population: a first group with sizes ranging from 0.004 to 1\u00a0\u03bcm with a maximum at 0.02\u00a0\u03bcm, and a second group of 100\u00a0\u03bcm-sized pores. Comparison of data from both parts of the cataclasite shows that macropores do not seem to be filled by microquartz cement.\n\n\n4.4.2\nArkose\nTotal porosity and dissolution porosity of both types of feldspars were measured by treatment of backscattered electron images (SD-porosity data) in the twelve samples of arkoses (SPB1 to SPB12) collected in the eastern part of the quarry by Kushnir et al. (2018). The total porosity of arkose in sample 9 was measured by water porosity. Total porosities measured by water porosity and by image treatment (\u0424) range between ~5 and 14% (Table 4), and are consistent with He porosities of Kushnir et al. (2018). They are representative of the connected porosity in arkose. Total porosity of samples SPB1 to SPB12 is relatively well correlated with grain size. Feldspar dissolution porosity provides evidence of a positive correlation between total porosity and porosity of plagioclase and K feldspar dissolution (Fig. 10\na; Fig. 10b). In all cases, plagioclase dissolution porosity is significantly greater than K feldspar dissolution porosity. The smallest porosity values are associated with two samples SPB5 and SPB10 that have protocataclastic or fine-grained texture and K-feldspar porosity filled by quartz.\n\n\n\n4.5\nGeochemistry\n\n4.5.1\nTrace elements in different generations of quartz from the granite\nWe identified various generations of quartz in the granite matrix and fractures based on their textural relationships, morphology, and size. However, it remains challenging to distinguish all generations under the microscope, due to polyphase tectonics and fluid circulation. For this reason, we analyzed 22 trace elements in different quartz generations, among them magmatic quartz and pegmatitic quartz in a granite sample 8, and euhedral quartz partially filling macroporosity in breccia collected on the long (>30\u00a0m) fault surface (sample 5). Among the 22 trace elements that were analyzed, only Li, Al, Ti, Sc, Ge, As, and Sb are detected (SD-trace elements).\nMagmatic quartz has high Sc (4.6\u20135.8\u00a0ppm) and Ti (4.8\u20138.1\u00a0ppm) concentrations and the lowest Li (21\u201353\u00a0ppm), Al (151\u2013265\u00a0ppm), and Ge (0.8\u20131.3\u00a0ppm) values. In pegmatitic quartz, Sc concentrations remain high (3.8\u20136\u00a0ppm), whereas Ti values are very low (0.7\u20131\u00a0ppm) and Li (34\u201347\u00a0ppm), Al (236\u2013335\u00a0ppm), and Ge (2.1\u20132.5\u00a0ppm) values are higher. Magmatic and pegmatitic quartz do not contain other metals (if present, they are below detection limits). Comparatively euhedral quartz in macroporosity of breccia has very low Ti (0.1\u20130.3\u00a0ppm) and Sc (2.4\u20133.4\u00a0ppm) concentrations, the highest Li (623\u20131043\u00a0ppm), Al (2140\u20132673\u00a0ppm), and Ge (7\u201313.3\u00a0ppm) values, and significant traces of As (3.3.-21.7\u00a0ppm) and Sb (3.6\u20135.4\u00a0ppm).\n\n\n4.5.2\nU\u2013Th systematics on iron hydroxides\nFor U\u2013Th measurements, we selected iron hydroxides that fill a major fracture in the altered-fractured zone on the eastern side of the quarry (sample 3). Two aliquots of sample were prepared and analyzed. Results are reported in Table 5\n.\nBoth samples display relatively high U concentrations, with a slightly higher U content for sample 3.2 compared to sample 3.3. In contrast, Th concentrations are similar in both aliquots (Table 5). Present-day Th\/U ratios are 1.8 and 2.4 for sample 3.2 and sample 3.3, respectively. Such values are clearly lower than those of the upper continental crust (~4), (Taylor and McLennan, 1995; Wedepohl, 1995).\nUranium activity ratios are similar in the both aliquots and are slightly but significantly higher than the value of secular equilibrium (Table 5). This implies that the system is open at present for uranium, or at least has been open for the last million years. 230Th\/234U and 230Th\/238U activity ratios in the two aliquots are also higher than 1, indicating uranium loss because Th is usually considered to be generally insoluble during water\/rock interaction processes.\nSimple uranium loss is inconsistent with the data. Water\/mineral interaction processes are likely to result in a234U\/238U ratio lower than 1 in the solid phase, and inversely, higher than 1 in the interacting water, due to the preferential leaching of 234U in the solid phase as a result of \u03b1-recoil processes (Fleischer, 1980).\nThus the most probable hypothesis to explain the data calls for open-system evolution with a U input from interacting water (thus probably having a234U\/238U activity ratio higher than 1) and a concomitant loss of U in the solid. The following possible evolution model has been tentatively derived, based on the following assumptions regarding the geochemical characteristics of incoming water and the initial solid:\n\n-\na single-stage model open-system evolution,\n\n\n-\ngain and loss of U do not vary through time,\n\n\n-\nboth follow an exponential law (order 1),\n\n\n-\nthe 238U decay chain is initially at secular equilibrium in the solid,\n\n\n-\nTh remains immobile during the open-system evolution.\n\n\n\nDifferential equations of a U-series open-system evolution model through time have been described and can be found in a number of references (Chabaux et al., 2003). Modelling parameters are given in Table 6\n.\nData have been plotted in a234U\/238U versus 230Th\/238U diagram (Fig. 11\n). A reference age of 12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 ky for the two samples can be derived, featuring similar loss and gain of U:1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 10\u22125 year\u22121 and 4.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 10\u22125 year\u22121, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nOrigine of the fracture network\nThe three zones with various alteration, the highly altered zone in the south-east part of the quarry, the slightly altered and fractured zone in the western and northern parts and the mixed zone between both, are part of a larger fault zone, and are defined as the core zone, damage zone and transition zone, respectively. The core zone, more than 50m thick, is composed of comminuted rock, breccia, protocataclasite, cataclasite, which suppose a high degree of fracture connectivity, and with more rarely ductile deformation bands in the granitic basement (Fig. 2-E and F). The larger faults in this comminuted rocks are mainly E-W (set 1) and cross the arkose\/granite transition. These main faults show cataclastic border in the granite and protocataclasites in the arkose.\nThe transition between the fault core and the damage zone corresponds to a collapse area limited with the damage zone by a polyphase breccia corridor (Fig. 2-C) and with the fault core by the wide bleached E-W fault surface that cross almost half of the eastern side of the quarry (Fig. 2-E). In this transition zone, around 20\u201325m thick, some E-W faults cross and displace the granite\/arkose transition of about 1\u00a0m with a normal movement. Thereby, the total offset in this zone is about 10m.\nIn the western and northern parts of the quarry, the damage zone, more than 100m thickness, constituted by non-comminuted rocks but is largely fractured including the two dominant fracture directions (Fig. 3), is uplifted of around 10m compared with the core zone.\nThe study area is located in a highly fractured region affected by a long tectonic history (Edel et al., 2007; Rotstein et al., 2006; Schumacher, 2002; Villemin and Bergerat, 1987). As a result, all scales of fractures are present. At the large regional scale, Valley (2007) analyzed the fault trace map and highlighted the primary direction of major structures that make up the graben and its vicinity. Three major directions predominate. A N0\u00b0E-N20\u00b0E direction (Fig. 12\n-A), known as the Rhenish direction, corresponds to the normal boundary fault that formed the Upper Rhine Graben during the Oligocene (Schumacher, 2002; Villemin and Bergerat, 1987) and possibly reactivated a Hercynian structure called the Upper Rhenish Shear Zone (Edel et al., 2007; Illies, 1972; Rotstein et al., 2006). A second main direction is NE-SW and the third is NW-SE (Fig. 12-A), both linked to Hercynian tectonics (Schumacher, 2002). The NE-SW direction being the direction of major Hercynian dislocation zones, such as the Lalaye-Lubine fault zone. At this scale, the E-W direction is poorly represented (Fig. 12-A).\nAt a smaller scale, in the northern part of the Vosges Massif, Bertrand et al. (2018) analyzed the lineament using a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) with various lighting and showed several main sets (Fig. 12-B and C). The three main directions cited above are present: N\u2013S representing 25% of the total; NE-SW, 10%; NW-SE, 15%, and two others, ENE-WSW and E-W directions representing 5% and 10%, respectively (Bertrand et al., 2018, Fig. 12-B). These authors focused on the southeastern part of the zone, just north of the Lalaye-Lubine fault zone and the Saint Pierre Bois quarry, and showed that in this area, the E-W direction predominates, accounting for 23% of the lineaments (Bertrand et al., 2018, Fig. 12-C).\nSouth of the Lalaye-Lubine fault zone, we digitalized the fault traces on the local 1\/50 000e geological map (Blanalt et al., 1972). The analysis shows four main directions: E-W, N\u2013S, NE-SW, and to a lesser extent NW-SE (Fig. 12-D). The E-W direction constitutes the main set as in the northern area analyzed by Bertrand et al. (2018) (Fig. 12-B).\nWhereas the main directions are equivalent, the distributions of each set are different in the Vosges Massif and in the Rhine Graben. The Hercynian directions, mainly NE-SW and NW-SE, are more common than the Rhenish direction (N\u2013S) in the Vosges Massif (Fig. 12). However, the E-W direction, which is mainly present in the Saint Pierre Bois quarry (Fig. 12-C and D) and its surroundings, is less frequent at the Rhine graben scale (Fig. 12-A and B). This fracture set could be related to Hercynian tectonics and linked to the direction of the Vill\u00e9 basin, which opened during the Permian at the end of the Hercynian orogen.\nConsidering the tectonic history of the area, the large E-W fault zone crossing the quarry could be in relation with the Saalian tectonic phase which has an ESE-WNW to NW-SE-oriented stress field (Bergerat, 1987). This constitutes the last Hercynian compression phase during the Saxonian before the formation of Permo-Triassic basins, such as the Vill\u00e9 basin. This E-W fault zone direction also matches to the Lalaye-Lubine fault zone, which corresponds to the Hercynian suture between the Saxo-Thuringian and the Moldanubian domains (Fig. 1-B).\nIn the damage zone, the fracture pattern can be compared to those defined by Bertrand et al. (2018) in the northern part of the Vosges massif. In this area, these authors define three orders of blocks separated by three orders of fractures. In our study, located further south and at another scale, the fracture pattern, represented by F1 and F2, are slightly different to the central block of Bertrand et al. (2018). As these authors observed further north, it appears a difference of final state of fracture network between the central block and the southern block, where it is located the Saint Pierre Bois quarry. As the fault zone, the F1 fracture set appears clearly linked to the Hercynian faults in the granite, which show also a dominant E-W magmatic fabric direction (Skrzypek, 2011), as the F2 fracture set (Arthaud and Matte, 1975). These fractures constituted a structural heritance reactivated during the latter deformation (Illies, 1972; Schumacher, 2002) and pathways for fluid circulation at different times.\n\n\n5.2\nMineralization, fluid\/rock interactions and their timing\nThe faults crosscutting the arkose\/granite transition rather favored fluid circulation through the granite and arkose. Fluid circulations are inferred from the mineralization in fractures, and mineral and chemical changes in the rock matrix due to water\/rock interactions, and their timing. Petrology and chemistry of fracture filling minerals in the granite and diagenetic minerals cementing the overlying arkoses provide evidence of almost similar processes of alteration, dissolution and precipitation in porosity of the two lithological compartments.\nThe microquartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0illite mineral assemblage is present in cataclasite, protocataclasite and breccia in granite fractures and matrix (Stage 2 - Table 2), and in protocataclasite and in quartz intergrains in arkose (Stage 2 - Table 3). Some coarser quartz, euhedral in granite and xenomorphic in arkose, and barite precipitated later in residual porosity of granite breccia and arkose. Fluid\/granite and fluid\/arkose interactions associated to this stage are the alteration of biotite into chlorite\u00a0+\u00a0illite\u00a0+\u00a0hematite, precipitation of illite 2M\u00a0+\u00a0APS\u00a0+\u00a0quartz in porosity of plagioclase dissolution, and precipitation of quartz in porosity of K-feldspar dissolution. Trace elements such as Pb and As, incorporated in euhedral quartz in granite and in APS in plagioclase porosity in both granite and arkose, strongly suggest that illite 2M, APS, and quartz with minor sulfides (galena and pyrite) in the granite matrix and arkose porosity are associated with this stage. Most of the trace elements present in minerals of this stage (Al, Ge, Li, Sc and As in quartz, Al, As, Ce, La, S, Sr and Pb in APS, Sc, Nb, Ta, Cr and Sn in titanium oxides, Pb and S in galena), and consequently in the fluid from which they precipitated were initially present as traces in primary feldspars and biotite of granite (Dr\u00fcppel et al., 2020), and resulted from their destabilization. It is noteworthy that the Ti concentrations of 5\u20138\u00a0ppm measured in some quite well-preserved magmatic quartz of the Dambach granite are significantly lower than literature values (Allan and Yardley, 2007), probably due to recrystallization and fluid\/quartz interactions (Haertel et al., 2013; Wark and Watson, 2006). This point is important, because it suggests that the least altered granite is affected by fluid-assisted deformation, remobilizing trace elements such as Al and Ti in the rock.\nIllite formation indicates temperatures of at least ~130\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C (Liewig and Clauer, 2000). Hydrothermal alteration in granite matrix are consistent with chemical alterations observed during experiments of fluid\/rock interactions between granite of the Schwarzwald (eastern shoulder of the graben) and NaCl-rich fluids at 200\u00a0\u00b0C (Dr\u00fcppel et al., 2020). Such temperatures are higher than those attained at maximum burial of the sediment cover\/basement in the eastern part of the Paris Basin transition prior to graben formation (Blaise et al., 2014). They were induced by an abnormal thermal gradient associated with volcanism during the graben formation in the Tertiary (Sittler, 1992). Early cataclastic textures and hydrothermal quartz, illite and barite formed at ~140\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C of Saint Pierre Bois are comparable to that described in faults crosscutting the Hercynian crystalline basement of the URG, such as the E-W Schauenburg fault zone on the east shoulder of the graben (Schleicher et al., 2006), or the fractures of the EPS1 well of the EGS Soultz site inside the graben, or NE-SW fractures in granite of the Waldhambach quarry on its west shoulder (Dezayes and Lerouge, 2019), which precipitated from deep hot hydrothermal fluids at the sedimentary cover\/Hercynian granitic basement transition in the URG at Tertiary prior to its collapse (Dezayes and Lerouge, 2019; Genter et al., 2010; Walter et al., 2015).\nThe second common mineral assemblage consists of iron hydroxides with minor clays and microquartz that fill residual porosity in granite fractures, faults, and breccia corridors in granite and in the arkose matrix. This stage is associated to a low-temperature alteration (weathering) of the primary magmatic minerals in granite and detrital minerals in arkoses that have not been affected by hydrothermal alteration, such as dissolution of K-feldspars, transformation of plagioclase into kaolinite and destabilization of biotite into illite-smectite mixed layers and iron hydroxides (Stage 3, Table 2, Table 3). Earlier hydrothermal minerals, such as quartz, illite and barite, are also affected by weathering processes. However, they are more resistant to weathering than feldspars and biotite, or are more difficult to identify such as illite and illite-smectite mixed layers. The iron hydroxides precipitated from iron liberated by destabilization of ferro-magnesian minerals such as biotite or chlorite, or remobilized by surficial fluids. U\u2013Th measurements on iron hydroxides in an E-W fracture in the core zone provide evidence of recent weathering processes (<1\u00a0Ma) affecting granites of the Vosgian massif (Ackerer et al., 2016; Schaffhauser, 2013).\nTextural relationships gave evidence of some iron hydroxides present in porosity of plagioclase and in fractures that were cemented by hydrothermal quartz and illite, and consequently formed earlier than them (Stage 1, Table 2, Table 3). This observation in most of the fracture fills in granite at the quarry scale provides evidence of weathering processes deep in granite prior to contemporaneous deposition of Stephanian arkoses, in agreement with Wyns (1999), Wyns et al. (2004) and Dezayes and Lerouge (2019). Even though it remains delicate to distinguish the two generations of iron hydroxides, it is important to not neglect this ancient weathering stage that was probably very similar to the present-day weathering in terms of chemical processes (feldspar dissolution, mica alteration), creating possible granite weakness and secondary porosity and favoring fracture network evolution and circulation of hydrothermal fluids (Callahan et al., 2020a,b).\n\n\n5.3\nDistribution of the mineralization in the fault zone\nMineral fillings and dissolution\/precipitations in the wall rocks attributed to the hydrothermal stage associated with deep hot fluid circulation and those attributed to the recent weathering at surface are present in the three parts of the fault zone: the core zone, the damage zone and the transition zone, and in the both lithological compartments: granite and arkose. Their distribution in the three parts of the fault zone is informative on pathways of the different generations of fluids in the fault crosscutting the arkose\/granite transition with time (Caine et al., 1996; Callahan et al., 2019, 2020).\nThe core zone in granite is characterized by abundant fractures that are filled by hydrothermal minerals and\/or low-temperature iron hydroxides. The surfaces of the smallest fractures are cohesive cataclasites of low porosity (<2.6%) that are rapidly clogged by microquartz with minor illite. Breccia associated with faults that are not entirely filled by microquartz and illite are clogged by late hydrothermal euhedral quartz and barite. Porosities measured in the both types of structure are lower than 2.6%, and are consequently close to porosity of initial granite. Breccia associated with fault surfaces, that were not clogged by hydrothermal minerals are filled with <1 My-aged iron hydroxides, and have porosity of ~5\u20136%, higher than the granite reference, indicating that they remain the rare active fluid pathways. Granite matrix wall rocks are highly hydrothermalized then weathered, show no relics of primary ferro-magnesian minerals, and exhibit a high degree of alteration and feldspar dissolution (plagioclase and K-feldspar). In fractures filled with hydrothermal-stage minerals, feldspar dissolution porosity is filled by quartz. Observations suggest that if the fracture network and the pre-Triassic weathering processes created porosity, hydrothermal quartz with minor clays clogged a large part of it, which explains why the granite matrix porosity is almost close to granite porosity (Kushnir et al., 2018).\nContrastingly, Stephanian arkoses in the fault core show wide range of porosity between 3 and 16% (this study; Kushnir et al., 2018). Fluid pathways seem to be more associated with matrix porosity due to feldspar dissolution and intergrain boundaries than with a fracture network. The lowest porosity values (down to 3%) are measured in the arkoses affected by protocataclasis in the core zone. They are low porosity due to hydrothermal microquartz shear bands and to quartz filling residual porosity, including porosity created by K-feldspar dissolution. Here, the deformation leads to pore space collapse, grain crushing, and porosity reduction, as has been observed in deformation bands (Antonellini and Aydin, 1994).\nWhile granite is highly fractured and altered in the fault core, the damage zone is characterized by E-W faults crossing a stiff granite that is barely altered. Most of the fractures and faults do not show aperture and are clogged by hydrothermal microquartz with illite, inducing low porosity values close to reference granite (2\u20133%). Among the E-W faults, one large (>30\u00a0m) cross the arkose\/granite transition and contains breccia where porosity attains 7.5% corresponding to a macroporosity represented by mm-to cm-sized open cavities partially filled by euhedral quartz, and more rarely barite.\nThe transition zone is a mixed zone limited by two major E-W stiff and almost clogged breccias. Clogging is essentially due to intense cataclasis and hydrothermal microquartz cementation.\n\n\n5.4\nEvolution of the fluid pathways in the fault zone with time\nThe relative width of the core zone and damage zone rather suggests that the fault zone crosscutting the Saint Pierre Bois quarry early acted as a distributed conduit, according to Caine et al. (1996). However, fluid flow and fluid-rock interactions have contributed to change hydraulic and mechanical properties along the geological times, leading to its almost clogging. The integrated structural, petrological, and geochemical study of the fault zone crosscutting the arkose\/granite transition in the Saint Pierre Bois quarry allowed reconstructing the evolution of the fault network architecture in term of structure, fluid\/rock interactions and porosity\/permeability, on the basis of previous models of fault architectural evolution (Callahan et al., 2020a,b and references therein) (Fig. 13\n):\n\n(1)\n\nInheritance may influence the initiation of faults (Crider, 2015). At the end of the Hercynian orogeny, the Dambach granite of Lower Carboniferous age uplifted and underwent erosion and weathered process (Stage 1 - Fig. 13). Even though we have evidence of pre-Triassic weathering (Wyns, 1999; Wyns et al., 2004; this work), it is not possible to evaluate its role (quantification of clays and dissolution de feldspars) on the petrophysical properties of granite at this period. At this stage, the suture between the Saxo-Thuringian and the Moldanubian domains was considered as a weak crustal zone (Edel and Fluck, 1989).\n\n\n(2)\n\nReactivation of inherited structures and development of new fractures with increasing deformation (Moir et al., 2010). This weak crustal zone allowed creating the collapse of the Vill\u00e9 basin and the formation of a dominate E-W fracture network. In this context, the formation of the E-W fault zone of Saint Pierre Bois during Permian results from the development and the coalescence of slip surfaces, including cataclasite and fault breccia, and ductile deformation bands affecting the Hercynian crystalline basement.\n\n\n(3)\nThe high-temperature (130\u2013150\u00b0C) hydrothermal stage results from the burial of the basin and the downward circulation of the hot brine and possibly the upward circulation in the deeper part of the basin (Stage 2 - Fig. 13). This results in quartz precipitation corresponding to the precipitation-strengthening model of Callahan et al. (2020a,b). Silicified breccia of cataclasites and breccias at the limit between the damage zone and the transition zone is the only evidence of dilation and failure (Callahan et al., 2020a,b).\n\n\n(4)\nAt the present-day stage, E-W breccia faults cemented by iron hydroxides in the core zone and edges of the rare E-W breccia corridors crosscutting the arkose\/granite transition in the damage zone remain pathways for present-day meteoric fluids (Stage 3 \u2013 Fig. 13), and could be potentially considered as efficient drains at depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis decametric-scale field study and petrographic analysis, including structural geology, petrological, petrophysical and geochemical analyses, in a Vosgian quarry identifies a previously unrecognized fault zone and its episodic mineralization.\n\n\u2022\nThis fault zone crosses the sediment\/basement transition, and shows a classical fault structure for crystalline rocks: core and damage zones, plus a transition zone:\n\n-\nThe core zone (>50m thick) is highly fractured and then have probably high connectivity. In the granite, hydrothermal minerals (quartz, barite) clog many fractures, whereas others currently filled by recent iron hydroxides likely constituted active (open) flow pathways. On the other hand, in the arkoses, fluids circulate only through interconnected porosity of the matrix.\n\n\n-\nThe transition zone (20\u201325m thick) contains E-W faults cross and displace the cover\/basement transition. The total displacement is around 10m.\n\n\n-\nThe damage zone (>100m thick) comprises non-comminuted rock that is fractured by two main fracture sets: E-W (set 1) and NNE-SSW (set 2). These fractures are randomly distributed in much of the quarry but locally fractures are concentrated in clusters. Some intervals lack fractures, where aplite and pegmatite intrude the granite. Hydrothermal minerals (quartz, barite) usually clog cavities along E-W faults but their edge, constituted by breccia, have a higher porosity and may constitute fluid pathways in the damage zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe main E-W fracture set present in the damage zone is kinematically consistent with local Hercynian tectonic movement and the Saxonian opening of the Permian Vill\u00e9 basin. This interpretation presumes that the inferred fault zone shares an E-W strike.\n\n\n\u2022\nEvidence from alteration suggests that the fault zone constituted a good fluid pathway until the fault formation and which evolves during the regional tectonic history and the burial of the Vill\u00e9 basin.\n\n-\nBefore basin opening, meteoritic fluids flowed in the granite and altered the core zone and the individual faults within the damage zone (Stage 1).\n\n\n-\nWith the burial of the basin, probably from Jurassic to Eocene, hydrothermal fluids, hot brine (130\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C), circulated and to altered the fault zone, the granite through fractures and the arkose through its matrix (Stage 2).\n\n\n-\nThe present-day fracture system is almost clogged by hydrothermal quartz deposits but the meteoric cold fluids circulate yet (Stage 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis fault zone model of structures at the cover\/basement transition can be transferred to other subsurface sites within the Upper Rhine Graben to assist the deep geothermal exploration in this promising area.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nChrystel Dezayes and Catherine Lerouge designed the study, collected and analyzed the data, and wrote the paper for the structural part and the mineralogical part respectively.

Fault slip is accompanied, at least in part, by off-fault damage (Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009). Faulting typically produces a dramatic time dependent effect on the permeability structure of surrounding rocks due to fracturing and recovery during repeated earthquakes (Barton et\u00a0al., 1995; Caine et\u00a0al., 1996; Sibson, 1996; Zhang and Sanderson, 1996; Curewitz and Karson, 1997; Evans et\u00a0al., 1997; Brown and Bruhn, 1998; Gudmundsson, 2000; Sheldon and Micklethwaite, 2007; Rockwell et\u00a0al., 2009; Rempe et\u00a0al., 2013). Faults can act as either barriers, conduits, or combined barrier-conduit systems to fluid flow. For example, Evans et\u00a0al. (1997) recognized that well-developed damage zones can act as conduits for fluid flow, while both the fault core and wall rock are typically less permeable and act as barriers to flow.\nFluids play a vital role in the chemical and physical evolution of extensively fractured fault zones (Stierman, 1984; Bruhn et\u00a0al., 1990, 1994; Parry et\u00a0al., 1991; Hickman et\u00a0al., 1995; Ishikawa et\u00a0al., 2008; Morton et\u00a0al., 2012). Fluids flowing through conduit-like damage zones have chemical compositions that reflect their source and migration pathways and carry the potential to cause mineralogical and chemical alteration of the protolith (Kerrich, 1986; Parry, 1998; Hagemann et\u00a0al., 2007; Rossetti et\u00a0al., 2010). At low temperatures (<200\u202f\u00b0C), host rock geochemistry may have a dominant effect on fluid chemistry and the precipitation step can be rate controlling (Denny et\u00a0al., 2019; Laubach et\u00a0al., 2019). Significant geochemical and mineralogical anisotropies in fault zones are commonly produced by fluid-driven processes (Evans and Chester, 1995; Goddard and Evans, 1995).\nThis study was conducted on the well-exposed fault zone of the surface-rupturing 2010\u202fEl Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. Through a microstructural and geochemical approach, we focused on gaining an understanding of the physical and chemical processes operating in the Borrego fault zone, and how those processes have affected the various properties of the rocks making up the fault core and adjacent damage zone. Enhancement of permeability and subsequent fluid flow is interpreted to have driven mineralogical and chemical changes that we attempt to resolve in this study. Sampling techniques utilized in this study allow for a nearly continuous perspective of the microstructural, geochemical, and mineralogical development of key structural components in the fault zone.\n\n1.1\nGeologic setting\nThe Borrego fault is a right-lateral normal oblique-slip fault located in the Sierra Cucapah in northern Baja California, Mexico (Fig.\u00a01\n). The Sierra Cucapah is a northwest trending mountain range that is geographically continuous with the Sierra El Mayor to the south. Both ranges comprise uplifted massifs of Mesozoic crystalline basement surrounded by rift valleys lying within the near sea level Gulf of California depression (Fig.\u00a01A). The fault-controlled basins are filled with 2\u20135\u202fkm of syn-rift sedimentary deposits that include local fanglomerate, extra-regional deltaic deposits derived from the Colorado River, marine strata, and older Miocene volcanic rocks (Barnard, 1968; Kelm, 1972). Some of these units, e.g., the Pliocene Imperial and Pleistocene Palm Spring formations, crop out at various locations across the entire Salton Trough region (Dibblee Jr., 1954). In the Laguna Salada basin, adjacent to the active Laguna Salada fault, the Neogene sedimentary sequence is up to 4\u202fkm thick (Kelm, 1972; Garc\u00eda-Abdeslem et\u00a0al., 2001).\nThe basement of the Sierra Cucapah is composed largely of Mesozoic age plutons that have intruded an older sequence of pre-batholithic sillimanite-zone Paleozoic metasedimentary units, including gneiss, quartzite, amphibolite, and marble (Barnard, 1968; Axen and Fletcher, 1998). Most of the central and southern Sierra Cucapah comprises a compositionally zoned batholith with variably foliated, coarse-grained biotite tonalite surrounding a core of massive leucocratic granodiorite with some quartz monzodiorite and quartz diorite (Barnard, 1968). The mineralogy, geochemistry, texture, and compositional zoning of the batholith indicates that it is likely part of the La Posta-type suite, a group of trondhjemite-tonalite-granodiorite plutons named after the La Posta pluton near the Mexico-U.S. international border (Miller, 1935; Clinkenbeard, 1987; Clinkenbeard and Walawender, 1989; Walawender et\u00a0al., 1990; Tulloch and Kimbrough, 2003). Barnard (1968) noted cross-cutting relationships that place a melanocratic phase as an intermediate pulse between the earlier La Puerta tonalite (\u223c96\u202fMa U\u2013Pb zircon) and the later Cucapah granodiorite (\u223c93\u202fMa U\u2013Pb zircon) (Moniz, 2008).\nRelative motion between the Pacific and North American plates produced a transtensional tectonic regime extending from the Gulf of California northward through the Salton Trough. Faults in the Sierra Cucapah have diverse orientations and range in dip from 20\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (Barnard, 1968; Axen and Fletcher 1998). This variation in geometry gives rise to extreme kinematic diversity (Fletcher et\u00a0al., 2014, 2016). For example, during the 2010 Mw7.2\u202fEl Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, at least a portion of nearly every major fault in the Sierra Cucapah was activated. Incremental changes in fault orientation were systematically associated with incremental changes in the rake of slip during the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake (Fletcher et\u00a0al., 2014, 2016). In the study area, the Borrego fault is steeply dipping with a strike of 325\u00b0, which is consistent with a dextral to normal slip ratio of 2:3 (Fletcher et\u00a0al., 2014, 2016).\nThe Borrego fault is one of several east dipping faults that terminate in the south at its intersection with the Laguna Salada fault. Slip on the east dipping faults is antithetic to the slip direction of the Laguna Salada fault, a dextral-normal oblique-slip fault that controls the west-facing escarpment of the Sierra Cucapah and its juxtaposition against the Laguna Salada rift basin. A narrow horst block (\u223c750\u202fm wide at the surface) of crystalline basement is developed between these two faults along the western flank of the Sierra Cucapah. Offset of a sharp vertical granodiorite-tonalite contact along the central part of the Borrego fault indicates total maximum dip slip of 4.3\u202fkm and a maximum vertical displacement of 3.5\u202fkm (Barnard, 1968), while the offset pinch-out of the melanocratic phase of the Cucapah granodiorite yields total dextral-normal oblique-slip of 6\u20138\u202fkm (Fletcher et\u00a0al., 2020). Because transtensional shearing is now well documented to have occurred during the earliest phases of rifting in the proto-Gulf of California (Seiler et\u00a0al., 2009), it is likely that the dextral-normal oblique-slip Borrego fault has been active since the onset of oblique rifting in this extensional province ca. 10\u201312\u202fMa (e.g., Mammerickx and Klitgord, 1982; Fletcher et\u00a0al., 2007).\nAs evidenced by their association with paleoscarps, offset stream channels, trellised drainage systems, proximity to seismically recorded epicenters, and activation in large historic earthquakes, faults of the Sierra Cucapah and surrounding areas are unequivocally seismically active (Barnard, 1968; Hileman et\u00a0al., 1973; Strand, 1980; Mueller and Rockwell, 1991; Fletcher et\u00a0al., 2014, 2016; Rockwell et\u00a0al., 2015). Based on paleoseismological evidence of the last four surface ruptures, the recurrence interval of large earthquakes (Mw7 or above) associated with the Borrego fault is estimated to be \u223c10,000 years (Hernandez Flores et\u00a0al., 2013; Hernandez Flores, 2015).\n\n\n\n2\nSite characteristics\nThe study area is located in an arroyo on the western footwall block of a prominent uphill facing scarp formed during the 2010 Mw 7.2\u202fEl Mayor Cucapah earthquake (Fig.\u00a02\nB). In a major flood event during the summer of 2013, the tectonically dammed arroyo was breached, which led to extensive erosion of the upthrown footwall, producing a well exposed scoured transect across the Borrego fault along the west-flowing arroyo floor (Fig.\u00a02A). Post-earthquake erosion exposed an \u223c1.5\u202fm thick fault core, and immediately adjacent to the core \u223c20\u202fm of damaged rock (Ostermeijer et\u00a0al., 2020) (Fig.\u00a02C). The interval of damaged rock between \u223c20\u202fm and \u223c40\u202fm from the fault core is covered by alluvium. However, damaged rock is again exposed between \u223c40\u202fm and \u223c52\u202fm, and Ostermeijer et\u00a0al. (2020) show that measured fracture densities display a power law decay reaching background levels \u223c85\u202fm, thus defining the width of the footwall damage zone at this locality. Because the outer \u223c33\u202fm of the damage zone is covered, we focused our work on the exposed portions lying within \u223c52\u202fm of the fault core.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a02, meso-fracture density is most intense from 0 to \u223c10.5\u202fm from the fault core, and is less intensely developed between \u223c13\u202fm and \u223c20.3\u202fm. Significantly though, pulverized rock occurs within a \u223c1.5\u202fm thick band adjacent to the fault core (Fig.\u00a02) (Ostermeijer et\u00a0al., 2020), cataclasite textures are otherwise characteristic of these two zones while fault breccia is more common between \u223c40\u202fm and \u223c52\u202fm (Dorsey et\u00a0al., 2017). In this paper, we refer to the above three parts of exposed damaged rock as zones 1 (0\u2013\u223c10.5\u202fm), 2 (>\u223c10.5\u202fm\u201320.3\u202fm) and 3 (\u223c40\u202fm\u2013\u223c52\u202fm) (Fig.\u00a02).\nThe NE dipping Borrego fault cuts the melanocratic phase of the Cucapah granodiorite, as well as parts of the La Puerta tonalite (Figs.\u00a01B and 2A). Within the study area, the melanocratic phase of the Cucapah granodiorite is tonalitic, makes up the footwall block, and deformed remnants of it can be traced though the \u223c85\u202fm thick damage zone and parts of the fault core (Fig.\u00a02A).\n\n\n3\nField and laboratory methods\nA continuous 2-m long cross-section of fault core, weighing over 100\u202fkg, was field-impregnated with epoxy, carefully extracted, and transported to the lab. Thin sections were produced from billets cut perpendicular to strike of the fault in both vertical and horizontal orientations across the entirety of the fault core.\nRepresentative samples of the damage zone were collected for bulk geochemistry, beginning at the western edge of the fault core and extending westward for about 6\u202fm into the footwall of the Borrego fault at approximately half-meter intervals (Fig.\u00a02). Beyond 6\u202fm, samples were collected approximately every meter up to 15\u202fm from the fault core. Beyond 15\u202fm from the fault core, three samples were collected between \u223c15 and 20\u202fm and three additional samples were extracted between 40 and 55\u202fm (Fig.\u00a02). Alluvial cover prevented collection of samples between 20 and 40\u202fm from the core. In order to preserve original textures, friable and poorly consolidated samples of the fault zone were cured with epoxy in the field. Following drying of epoxy and prior to removal from the outcrop, orientations were inscribed on each specimen. In addition, separate samples for chemical, density, and clay mineralogy were collected in the same sample locations (Fig.\u00a02).\nThin sections of eight representative samples collected from zones 1 through 3 of the damage zone and one sample of the parent rock were prepared for petrological study. Each thin section was studied carefully, with a focus on identifying key mineralogical and textural characteristics of damaged and parent rock. However, of the initial collection, only five thin sections did not contain abundant clays, and were not water sensitive, and thus could be chemically stained to distinguish K-feldspar from plagioclase. These five samples were point counted using a 1.0\u202fmm grid spacing. Depending upon the size of the slice of rock material adhering to the final stained thin section, between 300 and 400 points were counted in each sample at 100\u00d7 magnifications using a mechanized Nikon Eclipse E400 POL microscope. Points falling under the cross hairs were counted and assigned to the following categories: quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, microcline, chlorite, epidote, white mica, sericite (i.e., microcrystalline aggregates of white mica altering from plagioclase), biotite, matrix, open void, calcite, opaques, and titanite (Table\u00a01\n).\nFollowing the initial point-count study, all eight thin sections representing damaged rock in zones 1 through 3 were recounted for grain or clast size, and then were classified using the scheme presented in Woodcock and Mort (2008). For this phase of the study, at 100\u00d7 magnifications, 300 points were counted at a 1.0\u202fmm grid spacing and were assigned to the following categories based on 2-D area and equivalent diameters: large (>2\u202fmm), small (0.1\u20132\u202fmm), matrix (<0.1\u202fmm), open void, micrite, opaque cement, calcite cement (Appendix A).\nMajor and trace-element geochemical analyses were completed using standard X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) at San Diego State University following the method of Girty et\u00a0al. (2006). Results are presented in Table\u00a02\n.\nBulk (\u03c1b) and grain (\u03c1g) densities of 13 samples were measured using a He-pycnometer at San Diego State University following methods described by Girty et\u00a0al. (2008). Table\u00a03\n displays the results of this part of our study.\nIn order to gain some understanding of the precision of XRF chemical, and bulk and grain density data, we selected two large samples (\u223c500\u202fg\/sample), one from 52\u202fm (Z-2), and the other \u223c1\u202fkm (INT2) from the fault core (Fig.\u00a02A). Z-2 is from zone 3, while INT2 is from the melanocratic tonalitic phase of the Cucapah granodiorite. Each sample was split into 4 sub-equal parts. In the case of INT2, each split was processed identically, and then was analyzed for all major elements. In contrast, in the case of Z-2, each part, following identical processing procedures, was evaluated for bulk and grain density.\nFollowing analyses, coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated as the percent of the average of each oxide, bulk density, and grain density measurement, made up by the standard deviation (1\u03c3), i.e., CV\u00a0=\u00a0100\u2217(1\u03c3\/average). For geochemical data, the CV reflects changes in chemical compositions over spatial scales of \u223c0.1\u2013100+ m between samples, heterogeneities in mineral distributions at the scale of analyzed samples (\u223c125\u00a0g\/sample), accumulated errors during sample preparation, and machine error during analysis. In general, though the ranges in TiO2, K2O, and LOI result in CV of \u223c8%, \u223c12%, and \u223c17% respectively, geochemical data for all other elements are better than \u223c6% (Table\u00a02). Such variation is attributed to alteration of the melanocratic tonalite prior to development of the Borrego fault (Dorsey et\u00a0al., 2017). In contrast, \u03c1b and \u03c1g measurements are better than 1% (Table\u00a03).\nClay-mineral analysis of the <2\u202f\u03bcm fractions of eight samples was performed following conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) analytical techniques described by Moore and Reynolds (1989). Samples were air-dried, ethylene glycol solvated, and heat saturated at 400\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin and 550\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin. Analyses were completed using a Philips X'Pert multipurpose diffractometer with copper K\u03b1 radiation (1.5405\u202f\u00c5), and 45\u202fkV and 40\u202fmA settings. Typical scans ranged from 3\u00b0 to 32\u00b0 2\u03b8.\n\n\n4\nMathematical and statistical methods\n\n4.1\nPorosity and volumetric strain (\u03b5)\nPorosity (P) was determined from the following relationship:\n\n(1)\n\n\nP\n=\n\n100\n\u2217\n\n(\n\n1\n\n\u2013\n\n\n\n\u03c1\nb\n\n\n\u03c1\ng\n\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of these calculations are included in Appendix B and discussed further in following sections.\nAs discussed in Brimhall and Dietrich (1987) and Ague (1994), volumetric strain, \u03b5, can be determined as follows:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03b5\n=\n\n100\n\u2217\n\n[\n\n\n(\n\n\nC\ni\np\n\n\/\n\nC\ni\na\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n(\n\n\u03c1\nb\np\n\n\/\n\n\u03c1\nb\na\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n]\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Eq. (2), \n\n\nC\ni\n\n\n is the concentration of an immobile element, i.e., an element whose mass was conserved during fluid\/rock alteration. Superscripts p and a identify parent and altered samples, respectively. We selected Al as a suitable immobile element as it meets the necessary statistical criteria described by Carrasco and Girty (2015), and also because it is commonly conserved during chlorite grade alteration (Parry and Downey, 1982; Eggleton and Banfield, 1985). Resulting data are provided in Appendix C and discussed in subsequent sections.\n\n\n4.2\nEstimating the uncertainties in changes in elemental mass\nThe transport function, \u03c4, of Brimhall and Dietrich (1987) represents the percent change in an elements mass as a result of some metasomatic change. It is calculated as follows:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u03c4\n=\n100\n\u2217\n\n[\n\n\n(\n\n\nC\ni\np\n\n\/\n\nC\ni\na\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\nC\nm\na\n\n\/\n\nC\nm\np\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n]\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Eq. (3), \n\n\nC\ni\n\n\n and the superscripts p and a are as defined for Eq. (2); \n\n\nC\nm\n\n\n is the concentration of a likely mobile element. As noted above, Al was selected as the reference frame element. Utilizing Eq. (3), \u03c4 values were calculated for each sample (Appendix D).\nChemical compositions are constrained by both the range of each component and the constant sum constraint, i.e., SiO2\u00a0+\u00a0Al2O3\u00a0+\u00a0\u2026 LOI\u00a0=\u00a01 or 100% (Aitchison, 1982, 1986, 1989). They are therefore not allowed to vary freely from -\u221e to\u00a0+\u221e, a necessary precondition for multivariate statistical analysis of compositional data (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2006). However, the log-ratio transformation introduced by Woronow and Love (1990) circumvents this problem.\nUsing log ratios, Woronow and Love (1990) showed that\n\n(4)\n\n\nln\n\n(\n\nf\nm\n\n)\n\n=\nln\n\n(\n\n\nC\nm\na\n\n\/\n\nC\ni\na\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\nln\n\n(\n\n\nC\nm\np\n\n\/\n\nC\ni\np\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere f\n\nm\n is the multiplicative factor by which the mass of mobile element m changed, and all other symbols are as defined above. The significance of Eq. (4) is that once an element has been determined to be immobile, that element can be used to determine if the masses of other elements have been enriched (f\u202f>\u202f1), depleted (f\u202f<\u202f1), or experienced no change (f\u202f=\u202f1) relative to its unaltered mass. The percentage change in mass of element m can be determined from\n\n(5)\n\n\n\u0394\n%\nm\na\ns\ns\n=\n100\n\n(\n\ne\n\n(\n\nln\n\n(\n\nf\nm\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nEq. (5) represents a deterministic expression for calculating the percent change in elemental mass relative to an immobile component and yields results that are identical to the transport function, \u03c4, of Brimhall and Dietrich (1987). In order to distinguish between percent change in elemental mass calculated from either Eq. (3) or Eq. (5), we will refer to the former as \u03c4bd and to the latter as \u03c4wl.\nIn practice, when following the method of Woronow and Love (1990), we average over a suite of samples, and thus need to assess the statistical significance of our results for each group of analyzed altered samples. To accomplish this task, we used the statistical algorithm outlined in Warren and Girty (1999) and shown in Table\u00a04\n. Utilizing R, a language and environment for statistical computing (R Core Team, 2015), the mathematical and nine-step statistical procedures outlined in Table\u00a04 were implemented in an R script, and the average percent change in elemental mass along with the associated 95% confidence interval for samples analyzed from zone 1 (0\u201310.5\u202fm), zone 2 (>10.5\u201320.3\u202fm), and zone 3 (40\u201352\u202fm) were calculated. As noted in step 9 of Table\u00a04, if the 95% confidence interval does not include 0, then the results are statistically significant, and a change in elemental mass likely occurred. Results derived from the R script are provided in Table\u00a05\n where statistically significant results are highlighted.\nAnother important consideration when estimating total uncertainty in element transport is the potential variability in parent materials. As described in Section 3, the coefficients of variation for the geochemical data are relatively low for most elements and high for only a few. This variability was attributed to pre-faulting alteration (Dorsey et\u00a0al., 2017). Over the distance from the site where parent samples were collected to the fault zone (\u223c1000\u202fm), the parent rock appears uniform in texture and mineralogy. Furthermore, the mineralogy and textures of plutons of the La Posta series tend to be uniform over distances \u22652\u202fkm (Clinkenbeard, 1987; Clinkenbeard and Walawender, 1989). Notably, we used multiple samples of parent rock, but at a scale of cm. Thus, the parent samples are representative as the starting material prior to fault-related alteration.\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nThin section petrology\n\n5.1.1\nParent rock\nThe parent rock in this study, identified by Barnard (1968) as the melanocratic phase of the Cucapah granodiorite, plots in the tonalite field of the IUGS QAP ternary diagram for plutonic rocks (Fig.\u00a03\nF) (Table\u00a01) (Le Maitre et\u00a0al., 2005). In examined samples of tonalitic parent rock, hypidiomorphic-granular texture is well-preserved and sparse intragranular fracturing is evident (Fig.\u00a03A). K-feldspar and quartz occur interstitially, whereas euhedral-subhedral plagioclase is locally sericitized. Plagioclase commonly displays albite, carlsbad, and polysynthetic twins while K-feldspar commonly exhibits the gridiron twin pattern characteristic of microcline. Platy to anhedral biotite is abundant and commonly becomes altered to chlorite\u00a0+\u00a0epidote\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0titanite near contacts with plagioclase (Fig.\u00a03C). Utilizing the Michel-Levy method, plagioclase is biaxial (+) oligoclase (\u223cAn12 -\u202f\u223c\u202fAn18) (Kerr, 1959). Trace amounts of white mica, euhedral garnet, and opaque oxide minerals are also present. In comparison to fault zone rocks, the tonalitic parent rock is not heavily altered, and the local sericitization of plagioclase along with the chlorite-epidote-titanite assemblage replacing biotite likely reflects sub-solidus late-stage deuteric alteration (e.g., Kerr, 1959).\n\n\n5.1.2\nFault core\nThe fault core is composed primarily of deformed and fragmented clasts of carbonate and lesser amounts of quartzofeldspathic and mica-rich clasts engulfed in an anastomosing foliated gouge and mesocataclasite to ultracataclasite matrix. Clasts range in size from less than 1\u202fmm to greater than 50\u202fcm. Distinct textural and compositional domains exist within the fault core, some dominated by >90% matrix material, and others dominated by carbonate or quartzofeldspathic clasts >1\u202fmm in size. Clasts are more common near the edges of the fault core and most of the larger clasts are carbonate. The main source of the smaller carbonate clasts are large centimeter to meter lenses of white and blue marble that are smeared along the strike of the fault (Fig.\u00a04\n).\nThe fault core contains gouge-rich domains that differ in composition and color. Brownish gouge is typically richer in carbonate derived from marble smears, whereas, greenish gouge is rich in chlorite, and less commonly, quartzofeldspathic material (Fig.\u00a04B). The portion of the fault core closest to the 2010 scarp is lighter brown in color and contains a significant component of sheared alluvium and other sedimentary rocks derived from the hanging wall (Fig.\u00a04).\nThe restricted occurrence of carbonate in the fault core suggests that it may have been derived primarily from the hanging wall block, which contains marble and other types of metasedimentary rocks (Barnard, 1968). However, the same metasedimentary rocks are also likely to have made up portions of the footwall block at structural levels higher than are presently exposed at the surface. Carbonates were entrained, smeared, and fragmented in the fault core. Smearing of carbonate along the fault likely led to reduced permeability in the fault core (F\u00e6rseth, 2006). In contrast, undeformed calcite and quartz-rich veins (<1\u202fmm) are also present in the core and are probably derived from hydrothermal fluids that had infiltrated the core after the deformational fabrics had been acquired, but prior to its exhumation.\nNear the contact between the fault core and footwall damage zone, tonalite clasts that vary in size from <1\u202fmm up to \u223c10\u202fcm are present and typically record the shearing and fragmentation of the footwall block, which is expected to occur prior to its incorporation into the fault core. Macroscopically, the appearance of tonalite clasts in the fault core marks the transition into the tonalitic footwall damage zone (Fig.\u00a04). Microscopically, near the southwest edge of the fault core, a fossil principal slip surface juxtaposes clast populations dominated by quartzofeldspathic material and those dominated by carbonate material (Fig.\u00a04C). Another discrete slip surface that was activated in the 2010 rupture is observed to truncate older fabrics and cut out sections of the fault core producing along-strike heterogeneities in core thickness. In fact, to the southeast of the river-cut platform, the vertical scarp-forming fault completely cuts out the long-lived undulating fault core. Therefore, these discrete slip surfaces within the core must strongly affect the distribution of strength heterogeneities along the fault.\n\n\n5.1.3\nDamage zone\nAs noted earlier, we have subdivided the exposed portion of damaged rock into zones 1 (0\u2013\u223c10.5\u202fm), 2 (>\u223c10.5\u202fm\u201320.3\u202fm) and 3 (\u223c40\u202fm\u2013\u223c52\u202fm) (Fig.\u00a02). Rocks within zones 1 and 2 display grain sizes characteristic of the cataclasite series (Fig.\u00a05\nD) (Woodcock and Mort, 2008). Additionally, two of the innermost point-counted samples (C2-1 and C2-2) in zone 1 were collected from the \u223c1.5\u202fm thick band adjacent to the fault core that includes pulverized rock (Fig.\u00a02) (Ostermeijer et\u00a0al., 2020). Much of the grain size reduction in this innermost \u223c1.5\u202fm thick portion of zone 1 is due to extensional grain fragmentation and partial pulverization while cataclasite textures are found primarily in shear bands. The three samples collected furthest from the fault core in zone 3 are notably coarser grained than samples collected closer to the fault in zones 1 and 2. Based on grain size, two are classified as breccia while the third is a protocataclasite (Fig.\u00a05D) (Woodcock and Mort, 2008).\nThough there are marked differences in textures and fracture density, mineralogical features of samples from zones 1 through 3 are similar. Hence, to avoid redundancy, we here focus on the differences between these three zones. Protocataclasites and mesocataclasites occur throughout zone 1, but only protocataclasite was identified in zone 2 (Fig.\u00a05D). In contrast, samples from zone 3 are notably coarser grained and vary from protocataclasite to chaotic breccia (Fig.\u00a05D). In zone 1, large clasts are less abundant (0\u20132%), and matrix (42\u201354%) is more prevalent than in zones 2 and 3 where large clasts make up 14\u201347% and matrix makes up 5\u201337% (Fig.\u00a03B). In contrast, the percentage of small clasts varies across all three zones. Moreover, rocks in zone 1 show evidence of significant comminution, particularly in sheared bands that become more pervasive towards the fault core. These rocks are dominated by monomineralic clasts with less abundant polymineralic clasts that preserve relic tonalitic textures.\nWithin zone 3, the grain\/clast size transitions from a protocataclasite to a heavily altered and damaged breccia. Point counted samples from zone 3 reveal grain\/clast sizes characteristic of chaotic breccia (Fig.\u00a05D) (Woodcock and Mort, 2008). However, clasts\/grains in these samples show little to no rotation and therefore fit the textural description of a crackle breccia (Woodcock and Mort, 2008). Coarser grained mosaic and crackle breccias with \u223c5% matrix are also present (Fig.\u00a03E). Protocataclasite to mesocataclasite seams cut the breccia fabric and are primarily composed of comminuted plagioclase and quartz grains with smaller amounts of fragmented chlorite, calcite, and clays. The bounds of such seams are defined by an abrupt reduction in fracture density and the lack of matrix.\nThe mineral content of samples across all three exposed zones of damaged rock show little variation as revealed from point counting samples that were stained to distinguish plagioclase from K-feldspar (Table\u00a01). Throughout the damage zone, the primary tonalitic mineral assemblage is significantly modified by sericitization of plagioclase and chloritization of biotite. Damage zone rocks also are typically more rich in clays as compared to host rock samples. Some damage zone rocks contain an opaque oxide interstitial cement associated with cataclasite seams, which is not observed in the protolith. Calcite is present primarily as infill in highly fractured rock, and to a lesser extent, as an alteration product of plagioclase. Calcite displays abundant deformation twins but becomes more fibrous in cataclasite dominated domains. In some cases, undeformed calcite surrounds broken quartz fragments, and therefore reflects sealing following cataclasis.\nThe abundance of secondary minerals such as chlorite and sericite are correlated with an increase in intragranular cracks and calcite veins. Some calcite veins are crosscut and comminuted by mesocataclasite to ultracataclasite seams suggesting that they formed during progressive cataclasis.\nTextural evidence for albitization of oligoclase is relatively common throughout the exposed portions of the damage zone. For example, in specimens chemically stained to distinguish plagioclase from K-feldspar, where calcite veins transect fragmented and sericitized oligoclase, unstained haloes of plagioclase lacking sericitization are evident (Fig.\u00a05A). The unstained haloes lack the An component of plagioclase and are likely albite (Ab90-100An10-0), while more lightly stained portions are probably An-poor oligoclase (Bailey, 1960) (Fig.\u00a05A). Similar rinds or haloes of unsericitized low-An oligoclase to albite have developed locally around sericitized plagioclase fragments (Fig.\u00a05B and C).\n\n\n\n5.2\nClay mineralogy\n\nFig.\u00a06\n shows clay mineralogy data from the <2\u202f\u03bcm fraction of selected samples. Throughout the damage zone and parent rock, illite and chlorite are evident in all analyzed samples (Moore and Reynolds, 1989). Kaolinite is likely present in all or most samples but cannot be easily differentiated from chlorite due to the overlapping of the 7.16\u202f\u00c5 kaolinite and 7.10\u202f\u00c5 chlorite peaks (Fig.\u00a06). For example, Moore and Reynolds (1989) note that the 7.10\u202f\u00c5, 4.74\u202f\u00c5, and 3.55\u202f\u00c5 peaks of chlorite will be weakened, but not eliminated, when heat treated at 550\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. Most samples display these characteristics, but in some, the 7.10\u202f\u00c5 and 4.74\u202f\u00c5 peaks are completely destroyed after heat saturation treatment at 550\u202f\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a06). Based on this behavior, we infer that kaolinite is likely present in these samples.\nIn addition to the above clays, mixed-layer kaolinite\/smectite also is likely present in samples from zone 1 and may occur in limited amounts in specimens from zone 3. This observation is based primarily on the presence of a \u223c7.7\u202f\u00c5 peak in the glycolated sample and its shift to \u223c8.0\u202f\u00c5 upon 400\u202f\u00b0C heat saturation treatment (Fig.\u00a06). Based on \u0394\u00b0 2\u03b8 data in Table\u00a08.6 in Moore and Reynolds (1989), kaolinite makes up 70\u201380% of the mixed-layer kaolinite\/smectite.\nSmall quantities of discrete smectite are present in the parent rock and in zone 1 but is not present in zone 3 (Fig.\u00a06). Discrete smectite is indicated by the expansion of the \u223c15.0\u202f\u00c5 peak to 16.9\u202f\u00c5, and the appearance of an 8.46\u202f\u00c5 peak following ethylene glycol solvation (Fig.\u00a06) (Moore and Reynolds, 1989).\nHydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV) is present in zone 1 but does not appear to be present in the zone 3 samples or in the parent rock. This interpretation is based on the collapse of 14\u202f\u00c5 peaks to \u223c12\u202f\u00c5 after heat saturation treatment at 400\u202f\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a06). The 12\u202f\u00c5 peaks subsequently collapse further to \u223c11.8\u202f\u00c5 after heat treatment at 550\u202f\u00b0C (Harris et\u00a0al., 1992; Righi et\u00a0al., 1993; Purcell et\u00a0al., 2015).\nMixed-layer illite\/smectite, with varying proportions of illite, is present in zones 1 and 3 (Fig.\u00a06). It also is present in samples of the parent tonalitic material (Fig.\u00a06). Mixed-layer illite\/smectite is identified in samples by the appearance of an \u223c5.1\u202f\u00c5 peak following ethylene glycol solvation (Moore and Reynolds, 1989). Percent illite in mixed-layer illite\/smectite, estimated from Table\u00a08.3in Moore and Reynolds (1989), is typically 80\u201390%.\nThe remainder of the <2\u202f\u03bcm fractions analyzed during this study is made up of primarily plagioclase, quartz, and microcline. The presence of these silicate minerals in the <2\u202f\u03bcm fraction derived from the damage zone is interpreted to be due primarily to cataclasis or tensile grain shattering. In contrast, their presence in the parent tonalite is a relic of the separation process, which involved crushing using a mechanized rock chipper.\nIn summary, the results of our XRD work, supplemented by thin section observations, indicate that biotite to various degrees has been altered to chlorite and lesser amounts of smectite in the parental tonalite. In the damage zone, chlorite has been broken down further to HIV (Righi et\u00a0al., 1993). Thin section study of samples from zones 1, 2, and 3 suggests that they contain an order of magnitude higher proportion of chlorite than does the parental tonalite (Table\u00a01). The sericitic alteration of plagioclase observed in thin sections of the parental tonalite is likely composed primarily of illite, smectite, and kaolinite. In the damage zone, these assemblages are more intensely developed. Mixed-layer kaolinite\/smectite, and lesser amounts of illite\/smectite are prominent in zone 1 but appear to be less well developed in zone 3 (Fig.\u00a06). In summary, the greater alteration displayed by samples collected from throughout the damage zone likely reflects an increase in fluid flow through these zones in comparison to the parental tonalite.\n\n\n5.3\nPorosity and volumetric strain\nThe background porosity of the tonalitic parent rocks, based on bulk and grain density values measured on one sample, is 2%\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6%. Within the damage zone, porosity generally increases toward the fault core, rising from \u223c5% in zone 3, to 6%\u201311% in zone 2, to 13%\u201316% within zone 1, before falling off to \u223c8% within the band containing pulverized rock 0.8\u202fm from the fault core (Fig.\u00a07\n). The small data set\u00a0along with the absence of analyzed samples from the \u223c20\u202fm\u2013\u223c40\u202fm covered section inhibits efforts to obtain a best-fit solution to data displayed in Fig.\u00a07. However, if the one sample from the band containing pulverized rock is excluded, then an exponential best-fit curve appears to be a reasonable fit (y\u202f=\u202f14.613e\u22120.019x; R2\u202f=\u202f0.648). The resulting best-fit curve reaches tonalitic background porosities at \u223c68\u202fm (Fig.\u00a07). Matrix fraction (Appendix A) also follows a negative exponential form with distance from the fault, consistent with decreasing microfracture intensity.\nVolumetric strain data (\u03b5) are plotted against distance from the fault core in Fig.\u00a07. Relative to tonalite outside the damage zone, \u03b5 increases from\u00a0\u22121% - 8% in zone 3, to 3%\u201312% in zone 2. In contrast, within zone 1, \u03b5 values vary between \u223c16% and \u223c25% within 9.8\u00a0m\u20131.8\u00a0m from the fault core. This band of relatively high \u03b5 values are bounded by lower values of \u223c7% and \u223c9% at 10.5\u00a0m and 0.8\u00a0m respectively from the fault core. The latter value is from the band containing pulverized rock. If it is eliminated from consideration, then the logarithmic best-fit curve (y\u00a0=\u00a0\u22126.557ln(x)\u00a0+\u00a027.576; R2\u202f=\u202f0.665) displayed in Fig.\u00a07 appears to be an adequate fit. Logarithmic best-fit was used because standard best-fit exponential techniques do not allow negative values. Notably, the resulting curve reaches 0 volumetric strains at \u223c68\u202fm (Fig.\u00a07). Thus, results from porosity and volumetric strain measurements yield identical results that suggest a damage zone width of \u223c68\u202fm. These estimates are less than the 85\u202fm determined from the more robust set of fracture data in Ostermeijer et\u00a0al. (2020). However, they may imply that porosity and volumetric strains decline more rapidly to background levels than do meso-fracture densities, and thus yield smaller estimates of damage zone width.\n\n\n5.4\nGeochemistry\nIn this study, the goal of geochemical analyses was to quantify changes in elemental mass resulting from damage and alteration in an active fault zone (Table\u00a05). Therefore, elemental mass redistribution, in comparison to the tonalitic parent rock, is the primary focus of this section. To assess the spatial pattern of elemental mass redistribution in zones 1 through 3, \u03c4\n\nbd\n values were plotted against distance from the fault core (Fig.\u00a08\n). The resulting plot revealed that \u03c4\n\nbd\n values, regardless of the element investigated, tended to cluster within their above designated spatial groups, i.e., zones 1, 2, and 3 (Fig.\u00a08). Because of this clustering affect, we overlaid \u03c4\n\nwl\n and their associated 95% confidence bands.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a08, regardless of spatial position, all \u03c4\n\nbd-Si\n values plot along or about the zero-change reference line with all sample points lying between 20% and\u00a0\u221220% \u03c4\n\nbd-Si\n. Additionally, \u03c4\n\nwl-Si\n derived from samples from zones 1 through 3 are 2%\u00a0+\u00a09%\/-8%,\u00a0\u22122% \u00b1 2%, and\u00a0\u221213%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%, respectively (Table\u00a05). Only the latter set of data do not include the zero-change reference line, and therefore is statistically significant (Fig.\u00a08). Such data are consistent with no change in Si mass across zones 1 and 2, with small losses of Si mass occurring in zone 3 (Table\u00a05).\nData derived from \u03c4\n\nbd-K\n calculations scatter from just below the zero-change reference line to values as high as 100% (Fig.\u00a08). In contrast, \u03c4\n\nwl-K\n from zones 1 through 3 are 25%\u00a0+\u00a035%\/-27%, 37%\u00a0+\u00a053%\/-38%, and 14%\u00a0+\u00a066%\/-42%, respectively. In Fig.\u00a08, the 95% confidence bands for all of these data sets include the zero-change reference line and are therefore not statistically significant (Table\u00a05).\nIn Fig.\u00a08, all three sets of \u03c4\n\nbd-Ti\n, \u03c4\n\nbd-Mn\n\n, and \u03c4\n\nbd-Fe\n have similar distribution patterns. In these patterns, data from zones 1 and 2 scatter, plotting on, above, or below the zero-reference line, while data from zone 3 plot above. As expected, the 95% confidence bars for \u03c4\n\nwl-Ti\n, \u03c4\n\nwl-Mn\n\n, and \u03c4\n\nwl\n\n-\n\nFe\n from samples analyzed from zones 1 and 2 include the zero-change reference line and are not statistically significant. In contrast, the 95% confidence bars for \u03c4\n\nwl-Fe\n and \u03c4\n\nwl-Mn\n in zone 3 do not include zero, while the opposite is true for \u03c4\n\nwl-Ti\n. In short, Ti mass was conserved across zones 1 through 3, while Fe and Mn mass were conserved across zones 1 and 2. In contrast, Fe and Mn mass was added to zone 3.\nAll \u03c4\n\nbd-Ca\n from samples analyzed from zones 1 and 2 plot below the zero-change reference line, while samples from zone 3 plot either above or below (Fig.\u00a08). Following in parallel, \u03c4\n\nwl-Ca\n are\u00a0\u221260%\u00a0+\u00a025%\/-15% for zone 1, -58%\u00a0+\u00a049%\/-23% for zone 2, and -9%\u00a0+50%\u201332% for zone 3. The latter set of data are not statistically significant, while the former are (Table\u00a05) (Fig.\u00a08). Such data imply that significant Ca mass was removed from zones 1 and 2 while Ca mass in zone 3 was conserved.\nSamples analyzed from the zones 1 and 2 have \u03c4\n\nbd-P\n that scatter, plotting on, above, or below the zero-change reference line (Fig.\u00a08). For samples from zone 1, the 95% confidence bands for \u03c4\n\nwl-P\n do not include 0 and are therefore statistically significant (Table\u00a05) (Fig.\u00a08). The opposite is true for samples analyzed from zones 2 and 3. The above data indicate that significant P mass was removed from zone 1 while P mass was statistically conserved within zones 2 and 3.\nIn contrast to the above data, most \u03c4\n\nbd-Mg\n, \u03c4\n\nbd-Na\n, and \u03c4\n\nbd-LOI\n derived from samples analyzed from zones 1 and 2 plot above the zero-reference line. In contrast, only \u03c4\n\nbd-Mg\n and \u03c4\n\nbd-LOI\n derived from samples analyzed from zone 3 follow a similar pattern, while \u03c4\n\nbd-Na\n plot both above and below the reference line (Fig.\u00a08). These data suggest an increase in Mg, Na, and LOI mass in zones 1 and 2 and are supported by statistically significant \u03c4\n\nwl-Mg\n, \u03c4\n\nwl-Na\n, and \u03c4\n\nwl-LOI\n values for these areas (Table\u00a05) (Fig.\u00a08). Additionally, \u03c4\n\nwl-Mg\n and \u03c4\n\nwl-LOI\n from samples analyzed from zone 3 are statistically significant, but \u03c4\n\nwl-Na\n is not (Fig.\u00a08).\nThe above data allow some inferences to be made about the fluids that migrated through the damage zone of the Borrego fault. The losses of Ca mass within zones 1 and 2 reflect incongruent leaching from plagioclase and the sericitization of feldspars suggest an acidic character for the fluids (Brookins, 2012; Taylor and Eggleton, 2001). Such acidic conditions are also consistent with the partial dissolution of apatite. Although a small sample size, the loss of P mass within zone 1 could be caused by the dissolution of apatite. However, as P content is controlled by small amounts of apatite, primary variation in apatite content or samples that lacked the size to represent bulk apatite (P content) cannot be ruled out.\nThough the oxidation state of Fe was not determined, conservation of Fe and Mn mass within zones 1 and 2 indicate interaction with an oxidizing fluid. The general increases in Mg and Na mass within these two zones likely reflect the observed chloritization of biotite and albitization of plagioclase, respectively, which require introduction of Mg2+ and Na+ (Parry and Downey, 1982; Eggleton and Banfield, 1985; Morad et\u00a0al., 1990).\nThe statistically significant increases in Fe, Mg, and Mn in zone 3, is consistent with oxidizing conditions, and a pH less than that characteristic of the solubility field of Mn+2 (Brookins, 2012; Taylor and Eggleton, 2001). This latter rather loose constraint is consistent with acidic to slightly alkaline conditions (Brookins, 2012).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nPre-faulting deuteric alteration in the Sierra Cucapah\nPrior to development of the Borrego fault, the parent melanocratic tonalite is inferred to have undergone deuteric alteration under relatively high-temperature conditions that produced the assemblage of epidote, chlorite, titanite, and sericite. This deuteric alteration can be explained using the balanced reaction from Eggleton and Banfield (1985) if we substitute the observed secondary sericite for muscovite, as follows:\n\n1 biotite\u00a0+\u00a00.21 anorthite\u00a0+\u00a01.64 H2O\u00a0+\u00a01.46H+\u00a0+\u00a00.08 O2 \u2192 0.46 chlorite\u00a0+\u00a00.11 titanite + 0.10 epidote\u00a0+\u00a00.56 muscovite\u00a0+\u00a00.63 quartz\u00a0+\u00a00.02 magnetite\u00a0+\u00a01.46K+\n\n\n\n\nThis reaction likely occurs at temperatures of ca. 330\u2013340\u202f\u00b0C (Eggleton and Banfield, 1985), which would have been experienced during the protracted history of post-crystallization cooling of the tonalite.\n\n\n6.2\nFluid pathways and hydrothermal metasomatism in the Borrego fault zone\nDuring development of the Borrego fault, the tonalitic parent rock was subjected to shearing and fragmentation, which led to significant grain size reduction that progressively intensifies toward the fault core producing the following sequence of fault rocks: protocataclasite, mesocataclasite, ultracataclasite. All of these fault rocks are found within the 1.5\u202fm fault core, which also contains abundant foliated gouge and pulverized rock. The increasing density of opening-mode micro-fractures (Ostermeijer et\u00a0al., 2020) likely was responsible for the observed increase in porosity toward the fault core (Fig.\u00a07).\nTaken in context, within zones 1 and 2, Mg- and Na-rich fluids are interpreted to have infiltrated the damage zone along a complex network of patchily developed interconnected fractures, producing additional chloritization of biotite and albitization of plagioclase. Similar Mg- and Na-rich brines are common among some hydrothermal systems. Truesdell et\u00a0al. (1981) demonstrated in their example from the Cerro Prieto system, just \u223c30\u202fkm to the SE of this study area, that Mg and Na were transferred to rock while Ca was leached from rock. Additionally, Guti\u00e9rrez-Negr\u00edn (2015) documented that fluids within one sector of the Cerro Prieto system are acidic, similar to fluids along the Borrego fault. And as we have hypothesized for the Borrego fault, McLelland et\u00a0al. (2002) documented albitization resulting from the infiltration of sodic brines in part of a regional hydrothermal system located in the Adirondacks, New York, USA.\nHydrothermal metasomatism, as defined by Bucher and Frey (2013) and Coombs (1961), involves hot solutions or gases percolating through fracture networks in rocks, and consequentially causing mineralogical and chemical changes in these rocks. At the study site, this stage of hydrothermal alteration involving Na- and Mg-rich fluids can be explained with the following stoichiometric reactions from Yonkee et\u00a0al. (2003):\n\n1.)\nCa0.17Na0.83Al1.17Si2.83O8\u00a0+\u00a00.33Na+\u00a0+\u00a00.67SiO2 \u2192 1.17NaAlSi3O8\u00a0+\u00a00.17Ca2+\n\n\n\n2.)\n2KFe2MgAlSi3O10\u00a0+\u00a03Mg2+\u00a0+\u00a04H2O\u00a0+\u00a03O2 \u2192 Mg5Al2Si3O10(OH)8\u00a0+\u00a02K+\u00a0+\u00a04H+\u00a0+\u00a02Fe2O3\u00a0+\u00a03SiO2\n\n\n\n3.)\n3NaAlSi3O8\u00a0+\u00a0K+\u00a0+\u00a02H+ \u2192 KAl3Si3O10(OH)2\u00a0+\u00a03Na+\u00a0+\u00a06SiO2\n\n\n\n\nThe alteration of oligoclase consumes Na+ and silica, releases Ca2+ and produces albite (Reaction 1). In contrast, the alteration of Fe-rich biotite consumes Mg2+, releases K+ and H+, and produces Mg-rich chlorite, silica, and oxidized Fe (Reaction 2). Acidic fluids drive the alteration of albite, which consumes K+, releases Na+, and produces muscovite (illite) and silica. Si is consumed by Reaction 1 but is produced by Reactions 2 and 3. In contrast, Al is conserved by all three reactions. Therefore, the three reactions operating together produce no significant additions or losses of Al and Si within the system.\nWhile some of the Na+ consumed in Reaction 2 may come from the alteration of albite to muscovite (illite) (Reaction 3), the gain in Na mass in zones 1 and 2 requires an external source for Na+. The above system of reactions also requires an external source for Mg2+ as well as a sink for Ca2+ and K+. A possible sink for Ca2+ in this system is secondary calcite, as observed in thin sections of the damage zone. However, as Ca mass was generally not conserved in zones 1 and 2, we interpret that it was predominantly carried out of the system. During hydrothermal metamorphism, the movement of K+ produced during the formation of chlorite to sites of alteration in plagioclase may have aided formation of illite (e.g., B\u00e9tard et\u00a0al., 2009), and as a result, K mass was retained within the damaged rock system (Reaction 3).\nThe hydrothermal brine of the Cerro Prieto geothermal field is thought to have formed from mixing Colorado River water with high salinity seawater which was then circulated to magmatic depths where it was heated and altered, adding Na and Mg to the rock while leaching Ca, K, and other elements (Truesdell et\u00a0al., 1981). These changes in fluid chemistry were inferred to have been brought about by albitization, chloritization, and the formation of clays in host rock. We present strong evidence that all three processes were also operating in the Borrego fault zone, causing damaged rock to gain Na and Mg, while losing Ca mass. Being only \u223c30\u202fkm from the Cerro Prieto geothermal site, the source of Na- and Mg-rich fluids along the Borrego fault could be similar, although may involve meteoric-sourced waters mixing with precipitated salts of the nearby playa.\n\n\n6.3\nReaction progress and cataclasis\nThough we have no direct means for evaluating pressures, following Eggleton and Banfield (1985), the absence of synkinematic epidote and titanite as part of the replacement product of biotite in the damage zone samples may imply temperatures that were lower than ca. 330\u2013340\u202f\u00b0C. Other studies have shown that chloritization of biotite without production of epidote and titanite can occur at temperatures of ca. 200\u202f\u00b0C (Parry and Downey, 1982). Given the apparent link between albitization and chloritization, we speculate that within zones 1 and 2 both processes were driven by hot (\u223c200\u202f\u00b0C) Na- and Mg-rich fluids. Therefore, 200\u202f\u00b0C represents an estimate of temperature for hydrothermal metasomatism driven by the infiltration of Mg- and Na-rich fluids into zones 1 and 2 of the Borrego fault zone. Although the above alteration reactions affected rocks throughout the Borrego fault zone, reaction progress depended on high porosity, dilational volumetric strain, and fracture density, and thus alteration progressed to a greater degree within zones 1 and 2 adjacent to the fault core (Figs.\u00a06 and 7).\nAlthough chlorite is the dominant phyllosilicate in the damaged rock system, mixed-layer clays, kaolinite, and HIV also are prevalent. These other clay species do not occur in the parent deuterically-altered tonalite, and thus their association with the damaged rock system suggest that fluids were focused through the patchily developed network of fractures within the damage zone.\nRocks in zone 3 are less fragmented than those in zones 1 and 2, but they still show an increased concentration of chlorite as well as albite alteration haloes on the rims of calcite veins. Although limited by sample size (n\u202f=\u202f3), all analyzed samples from zone 3 show gains in Mg, and in two of the three samples an increase in Na mass is evident. It is therefore likely that rocks in zone 3 have undergone a similar hydrothermal alteration process, albeit to a much lesser degree than in zones 1 and 2. As volumetric strain and porosity approach background values in zone 3 (Fig.\u00a07), some fractures are infilled with undamaged calcite (Fig.\u00a03E).\n\n\n6.4\nExhumation and regional geothermal\nThe total dip slip offset of the Borrego footwall has been estimated to be between 3\u202fkm and 4\u202fkm (Barnard, 1968), which is not sufficiently deep for the footwall to have experienced ambient temperatures of 200\u202f\u00b0C (even using the high geothermal gradient highlighted by Espinosa-Carde\u00f1a and Campos-Enriquez (2008)) as indicated by the phase equilibria of the alteration reactions (e.g., Parry and Downey, 1982). However, additional exhumation could have taken place on the Laguna Salada fault, which is the main fault that controls the topography of the Sierra Cucapah and Laguna Salada basin and is a structure that contains the Borrego fault in its immediate footwall. To the south in Sierra El Mayor, the Laguna Salada fault is mechanically linked to the Ca\u00f1ada David detachment, which exposes footwall rocks that initiated at depths greater than the 200\u202f\u00b0C isotherm (Axen et\u00a0al., 2000). This relationship is supported by apatite fission track ages of 5\u202fMa, which are much younger than the onset of faulting, and by modeling of Ar diffusion in K-feldspar, which has a blocking temperature of 220\u202f\u00b0C (Axen et\u00a0al., 2000). There is likely a northward decreasing gradient in unroofing through the Sierra Cucapah (Axen and Fletcher, 1998), and thus prior to the onset of faulting, the rocks of our study area along the Borrego fault likely resided at higher levels in the crust with cooler ambient temperatures. Nonetheless, phase equilibria suggest that temperatures in the fault zone reached 200\u202f\u00b0C, which suggests that the fault zone has experienced hotter temperatures than the surrounding rocks, perhaps due to the channeling of hydrothermal fluids along the Borrego fault zone.\nRegional heat flow is high (>100\u202fmW\/m2) in northern Baja California (Lachenbruch et\u00a0al., 1985) and local heat flow in and around Laguna Salada basin is even higher (>200\u202fmW\/m2) (Chavez et\u00a0al., 2000; Prol-Ledesma and Mor\u00e1n-Zenteno, 2019). Currently, a high geothermal gradient in the region is well documented by the presence of the Cerro Prieto geothermal field (Nehring and D'Amore, 1984), the fumarole generated along the 2010 rupture of the nearby Pescadores fault (Fletcher et\u00a0al., 2014), extensive deposits of silica and native sulfur associated with the Ca\u00f1ada David detachment, and reports of high surface temperatures observed in field studies by some of the authors of this paper and Barnard (1968). In one such example, Rockwell observed temperatures of \u223c70\u202f\u00b0C at 1\u202fm depth in a soil pit dug into fan 3 (Mueller and Rockwell, 1995) along the Laguna Salada fault. Other soil pits along the Laguna Salada fault in the area of high temperatures exposed petrosalic horizons, which suggests that the hydrothermal solutions are probably brine-like in character. In addition, along the Laguna Salada fault, near the study area at the latitude of 32.44\u00b0N, there is a hot spring that currently expels salty solutions and forms a pool on the basin floor (Chavez et\u00a0al., 2000). Because the Borrego and Laguna Salada faults are connected by a more shallowly inclined fault at depth (Fletcher et\u00a0al., 2016), both should act as conduits for geothermal systems at depth.\n\n\n6.5\nAlteration and deformation history\nIn summation, a parent tonalite experiences the following sequence of alteration and deformation to obtain its current mineralogical and geochemical character:\n\n1.)\nThe parent tonalite pluton underwent pervasive deuteric alteration, leading to a chlorite-epidote-titanite-sericite assemblage.\n\n\n2.)\nThe deuterically-altered parent tonalite was fractured and fragmented in the footwall of the Borrego fault zone. Within a complex patchily developed network of fractures (Ostermeijer et\u00a0al., 2020), interconnectivity of porosity was increased.\n\n\n3.)\nThe enhanced permeability of the Borrego fault zone allowed the percolation of hydrothermal fluids, rich in Mg and Na, through zones 1 and 2, and to a lesser extent zone 3. The infiltrating fluids drove albitization and chloritization. Hydrothermal alteration through brine solution deposition is well-developed along both the Borrego and Laguna Salada faults. Thus, alteration that would normally be associated with higher temperatures and deeper levels of exhumation are present at the surface in the rising fault block between these two Plio-Quaternary faults (Fig.\u00a09\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6\nImplications for fault zone strength\nThe alterations that have occurred in the Borrego fault zone may influence mechanical properties of the fault rocks. The development of phyllosilicates, including chlorite, sericite, and clay minerals, introduces mechanical anisotropies into the rock mass. Specifically, platy phyllosilicates with a preferred orientation in gouge or subsidiary shears lead to an anisotropic permeability structure (Morrow et\u00a0al., 1984; Evans et\u00a0al., 1997; Zhang et\u00a0al., 1999). In such cases, fluid flow can be focused along the fault or other clay-bearing shears elevating pore pressure along that plane. Increasing pore pressure results in a decrease in effective normal stress on a plane and makes slip along such a plane more favorable (Sibson, 1990; Rice, 1992). Compartmentalization of fluid flow along faults throughout the Sierra Cucapah may be attributed to the development of phyllosilicate-rich alteration products. Phyllosilicates can also have a weakening effect on faults due to their strength anisotropy. When preferentially aligned, phyllosilicate minerals have low coefficients of friction (Moore and Laukner, 2004) and fault zones rich in phyllosilicates are frictionally weaker than other fault zones (Wintsch et\u00a0al., 1995; Tesei et\u00a0al., 2012) leading to an overall lower resistance to slip.\nThe Borrego fault zone is rich in phyllosilicates and may therefore be relatively weak compared to unaltered host rock, but other factors relating to deformation may counter these weakening processes. Fractures in the damage zone have been sealed by calcite leading to reduced microfracture porosity, a process that may have a strengthening effect as observed in other natural fault zones (e.g., Callahan et\u00a0al., 2019). The competing weakening and strengthening effects of alteration and sealing of fractures may lead to a strength disparity between weak phyllosilicate-rich shears and stronger rock that contains sealed microfractures in the damage zone. Sealing of microfractures is strongly rate-dependent, but under favorable precipitation environments, we expect strain to localize to the weaker clay-rich shear bands. In unfavorable precipitation conditions, unfilled microfractures remain weak and are more favorable to accommodate slip, leading to generally more distributed deformation. Fletcher et\u00a0al. (2020) found that parts of the Borrego fault experienced highly localized deformation during the 2010 EMC earthquake, while other sections displayed more distributed deformation across a wider zone. Thus, localization of slip on the Borrego fault may vary from event to event. A cycle of fracturing, alteration, and reduction of microfracture porosity is likely heterogeneous in both rate and spatial distribution, thus plausibly contributing to the sectioning of the degree of localization from one event to the next.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nDetailed fault zone studies, such as this one, provide valuable insight into processes operating in fault damage zones at outcrop scale. Our field and microscopic data demonstrate that deformation and hydrothermal alteration of a deuterically-modified tonalitic protolith increases toward the fault core as a result of increased porosity from fracturing. Elemental mass redistribution in the fault damage zone is likely driven by increased permeability and reactive surface area from fracturing which controls fluid-rock interactions. The primary driving forces in the geochemical alteration of the horst tonalitic block seem to be albitization and chloritization caused by infiltration of Mg- and Na-rich oxidizing fluids. These processes appear to have increased in intensity towards the fault core along the highly fractured fault damage zone of the Borrego fault studied in this investigation.\n\n\nCRediT author statement\n\nMatthew T.

They are also exploited as unconventional oil and gas reservoirs (e.g., Amendt et al., 2013; Ferrill et al., 2014). A sound understanding of the geologic structures (i.e., faults and fractures) within shales and the petrophysical properties that drive thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes is essential when addressing seismic imaging, seal-integrity, and induced seismicity associated with engineering operations.\nIn the brittle upper-crust, fault and fracture networks have a primary control on the transport of fluids (e.g., Moore, 1989; Carson and Screaton, 1998; Saffer and Tobin, 2011). These faults and fractures are rarely single planar features and their matrix and fracture properties typically vary as a function of shear displacement and distance away from the discontinuity (Caine et al., 1996; Wibberley et al., 2008; Faulkner et al., 2010). In shales, the alignment of platy clay minerals typically invokes an anisotropy in the matrix petrophysical properties (Aylmore and Quirk, 1960; Johnston and Christensen, 1995; Vernik and Liu, 1997; Wenk et al., 2008; Sarout et al., 2014). Within faults, the host rocks are typically worn and develop cataclasites, gouge, clay smear, and scaly clay fabric within the fault core (Caine et al., 1996; Faulkner et al., 2010; Wibberley et al., 2008). These structures alter the matrix properties and cause changes in flow and failure properties within the fault.\n\nCaine et al. (1996), and later Faulkner et al. (2010), describe a general fault\/damage zone model where the principal displacement zone (PDZ) has one or multiple low-permeability fault core(s) due to due to the smearing and wear of fine grained material within the fault, which is surrounded by a fractured damage zone. The damage zone just outside the PDZ has a high density of fractures, typically increasing permeability if not mineralized. The fracture density tends to decrease away from the fault core into the host rock. The fault core is commonly made up of clays, either from the decomposition of K-feldspar into kaolinite in crystalline rocks or smearing of clay-rich shale formations (e.g., Weber et al., 1978; Yielding et al., 1997; Lindsay et al., 1993; Eichhubl et al., 2005). However, several variations from this simple fault core\/damage zone model has been observed in nature, with variations in fracture density and mechanical properties around the fault core (e.g., Wibberley and Shimamoto, 2003; Lecl\u00e8re et al., 2015). Of particular importance to geologic carbon storage and nuclear waste disposal are through going faults within the shale caprock itself, where both the fault material and host rock primarily consist of clay minerals.\nThe Opalinus claystone (Opalinus Clay formation) is widespread in the Swiss molasse. It is considered as a potential caprock for carbon storage and as a host rock for nuclear waste disposal in Switzerland because of its low permeability and self-sealing properties (Bossart et al., 2018). The Mont Terri Rock Laboratory (Canton of Jura, Switzerland) is an underground rock laboratory that was built within the Opalinus claystone to study its hydrogeological, geomechanical, and geochemistry properties. Mont Terri provides a unique opportunity to study the structure and physical properties in and around a 1.5\u20135\u00a0m thick fault zone that cuts through the Opalinus claystone with an offset of \n\n~\n\n 10\u00a0m (e.g., Nussbaum et al., 2011). While resolvable in borehole sonic logs (e.g., Jaeggi et al., 2018), the so-called \u2018Main Fault\u2019 is indicative of a fault system, typical of a fault that might be encountered in the subsurface engineering operations (e.g., Casini et al., 2011; Tvedt et al., 2013; Baudon and Cartwright, 2008), which may be undetectable by regional geophysical surveys due to insufficient impedance contrast with the host rock. Thus, understanding the structural control on petrophysical properties of such features is of utmost importance to mitigate risks and reduce uncertainties around subsurface structures. Previous studies have concentrated on characterizing and understanding the host rock's mechanical and flow properties in the field and laboratory (e.g., Wild et al., 2015; Sarout et al., 2014; Bock, 2000; Bossart and Thury, 2008). However, the petrophysical characteristics of the fault are still quite unknown, due to the difficulties in preserving intact samples and preparing specimens for extensive petrophysical analysis (e.g., Orellana et al., 2018).\nThis paper presents the internal structure and its control on flow within the Main Fault at the Mont Terri underground rock laboratory. The structures and composition of the Main Fault were mapped using borehole image logs and cores from a drilling campaign in 2018 (CS-D experiment in Zappone et al., 2020). Previous microstructural characterization of the Main Fault (e.g., Nussbaum et al., 2011; Laurich et al., 2014, 2017, 2018) depicts finely distributed, \u03bcm-thin shear zones of drastically reduced porosity. In parts, these shears form a tangled network that resembles \u2018scaly\u2019 clay (cf. Vannucchi et al., 2003) with varying scaliness, ranging from C\u2032 and S\u2013C bands to less scaly regions with larger microlithons. The mapping corroborates the microstructural investigations and confirms the identified structural pattern of under formed host rock slices in an anatomising network of polished surfaces. Using the borehole image logs and core mapping as a guide, we selected preserved core samples to perform seismic velocity and permeability measurements, and compare the properties of the fault rocks with the host rock. Combining the results from the laboratory tests and the structural mapping with observations in the field suggest that the main fault orientation is not the most transmissive (at least within our study volume), we use the critical stressed fault theory (Barton et al., 1995) to indicate that certain fracture families within the Main Fault would be more conductive than others.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting and core details\nThe Opalinus claystone is an \n\n~\n\n 90\u2013131\u00a0m thick formation of dark grey, silty, clay-rich and sandy shales that was deposited \n\n~\n\n 174\u00a0Ma (Hostettler et al., 2018; Nussbaum et al., 2011; Bossart et al., 2018). The Molasse Basin sediments generally dips towards the south or southeast, with Opalinus claystone out croping in the northwest and occurring at depths of around 2.5\u00a0km near the Alpine front (Mazurek et al., 2006; Chevalier et al., 2010). Mazurek et al. (2006) estimated maximum burial depths of samples recovered from boreholes in Northeastern Switzerland to occur during the Miocene of at depths of \n\n~\n\n 2.8\u00a0km. The Opalinus claystone is sub-divided into three main facies: shaly-, sandy-, and carbonate-rich. All samples from this study come from the shaly facies located in the lower part of the formation, which is argillaceous with clays and bioturbated layers of marl with occasional layers (\n\n<\n\n 1\u00a0cm) of sandstones (Hostettler et al., 2018).\nThe Mont Terri rock laboratory is located in the Jura belt in northwestern Switzerland, and consists of tunnels and niches drilled in the Opalinus claystone (Fig. 1\na and b). The formation has been folded during the late Miocene as part of a fault-bend fold that resulted in an anticline structure (Fig. 1a). Within the lab the most evident tectonic feature is located within the shaly facies is the Main Fault, a thrust fault that formed as the Alpine foreland propagated to the NNW (Nussbaum et al., 2011). The fault architecture is heterogeneous and consists of fault gouge, scaly clay (Vannucchi et al., 2003), S\u2013C bands, Riedel shears, meso- and micro-scale folding, numerous fractures and fault planes, and lenses of undisturbed host rock (Nussbaum et al., 2011).\nWithin the context of the CS-D experiment (Zappone et al., 2020), seven boreholes were drilled through the Main Fault at a depth of 11\u201325\u00a0m below the laboratory floor. All but one of the boreholes were cored and in all boreholes optical televiewer image logs provide detail structure and geologic constraints on the interface between the host rock and the Main Fault. The optical televiewer log quality is typically better in the lower part of each borehole, and systematically worse in the inclined boreholes due to sediment build-up and wear during drilling (see Supplementary Information). In sections where the image quality is good, it is possible to map fractures, faults, and bedding with confidence. Foliation and fracture orientation measurements on the core were subject to magnetic variations caused by measuring from within the tunnel, and are less reliable than the borehole image logs because they are subject to approximately \n\n\u00b1\n\n15\n\u2218\n\n\n systematic variation. While the orientation measurements on the core are similar to those observed in the logs in our study and previous measurements (cf. Jaeggi et al., 2018), due to the increased measurement uncertainty only borehole logging orientations are used in our structural interpretation. For transparency, the orientations measured on core are included in the Supplementary Information.\n\n\n3\nInternal fault structure\nPrevious research details the microstructure of the Main Fault (e.g., Nussbaum et al., 2011; Laurich et al., 2014, 2017, 2018). There are four main structural elements within the Main Fault: (1) \u03bcm-thin fractures, which, in high abundance, make (2) distinct regions of scaly clay and (3) two types of gouge (most prominent at the fault zones\u2019 borders), as well as (4) veins (mainly calcite). When scaliness is high, the shear zone density increases so that microlithons become very small (Laurich et al., 2018). The smallest ones lie within the width of the two shear zones that bound the microlithon (approx. 20\u00a0\u03bcm). Even further deformation might yield gouges with two differing characteristics (Laurich et al., 2018).\nIn the study area, the top of the Main Fault is clearly identified in core and image logs with a \n\n~\n\n 1\u00a0cm thick dark black or grey fault gouge followed by a layer of scaly clay (0.05\u20130.5\u00a0m thick) in all cored boreholes (e.g., Fig. 2\na). The fault varies in true thickness from 1.5 to 3\u00a0m within the \n\n~\n\n 10\u00a0m3 study volume, and is oriented with a dip direction of N031-068\u2218 and a dip of 56\u2218\u201365\u2218 to the SE, respectively (Zappone et al., 2020). The mean orientation of the Main Fault trends N045\u2218 (dip direction) with a dip of 60\u2218, and its orientation and thickness is comparable to other locations in the laboratory (cf. Jaeggi et al., 2018). The Main Fault is approximately 15\u2218 steeper than the bedding, which has a mean orientation of N054\u2218 with a dip of 46\u2218 (Fig. 1c).\nThe internal structure within the main fault is extremely heterogeneous with multiple micrometer-thick shear zones that have shiny slickensides. Frequently, calcite veins run along these micrometer-wide shears dipping to the NW, SE, or S. No clear layers could be traced even across the boreholes that are \n\n~\n\n 1.5\u20132\u00a0m apart (Fig. 1b). Paleo fluid flow and vein formation was presumably restricted to times of tectonic activity (i.e., the formation of the Main Fault) (de Haller et al., 2014), where flow was localized along the shear discontinuities. The calcite and less abundant celestite veins typically form parallel to the Main Fault shear zones (Fig. 1c) and often form parallel and together with fault gouge (Laurich et al., 2014). Otherwise, for the rest of the time evolution of the Opalinus claystone solute transport has been diffusion dominated, as it is today.\n\nFig. 2 shows example structures from within the Main Fault. The first example shows a 2\u00a0cm thick scaly clay layer steeply dipping towards the SE that cross cuts a shallower dipping fracture set (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b depicts the contact at the bottom of the Main Fault indicated by the 1\u00a0cm thick black fault gouge, with a scaly clay layer above that has an intersecting conjugate fault set (after Zappone et al., 2020). The stereonet projection of the fractures\/faults reveals that there is an E-W conjugate pair and a NW-SE conjugate pair. A few fractures occur below the Main Fault boundary marker, but the rock itself does not have any tectonic overprint (i.e., scaly clay) and preserves its primary bedding. Finally, Fig. 2c shows a less deformed part of the Main Fault, where a light carbonate-rich bedding layer can be traced across the core. The fractures within this sequence become steeper and rotate towards the east from top to bottom.\nThe fractures in and around the Main Fault have similar trends, with the majority dipping around 45 to 65\u2218 to the SE, similar to the orientation of the Main Fault (Fig. 1b and c). There are additional fracture families that dip to the E, W, NW, and S, similar to those mapped in other boreholes and the gallery walls at Mont Terri (Jaeggi et al., 2018).\nWhile it is virtually impossible to trace these structures across boreholes without a large degree of uncertainty, Fig. 1d attempts to illustrate the potential relationship and orientation and extent of fractures within the Main Fault. The scaly clay layers are the thickest observable layering within the Main Fault. In Fig. 1d they have been traced and connected between boreholes following Riedel shear fracture orientation and S\u2013C fish structures (e.g., Passchier and Trouw, 2005; Skempton, 1966; Tchalenko, 1970). The scaly clay lenses are interpreted to be weak fish-like structures within a slightly less deformed fault core. In addition to the scaly clay lenses that occur within the Main Fault, both the top and bottom of the Main Fault had scaly clay texture in each of the boreholes. The W-NW dipping fractures tend to align in a similar orientation as R\u2019 fractures, and the E-SE and S dipping fractures tend to align in either the Y- or PDZ-orientation or R-fracture orientation. A W-NW dipping fracture from the fault-top in the BCS-D1 borehole has been traced to the fault-bottom in the BCS-D2 borehole because field hydraulic measurements indicated a potential hydraulic connection between these two locations in these boreholes (Zappone et al., 2020). Further insight as to the reason for this hydraulic connection following this fracture set versus other fracture orientations is elucidated in the discussion section of this paper.\nBecause of the heterogeneity of the Main Fault, several samples were taken from different parts of the Main Fault to better constrain the petrophysical properties across the fault (sample locations in Fig. 1b). Table 1\n describes the borehole, depth, sample lithology, and internal sample structure, as well as indicating whether the sample was taken parallel or perpendicular to the bedding\/foliation. We tested 15 samples (8 from the Main Fault and 7 from the host rock) to constrain the permeability, seismic velocity, and apparent dynamic elastic moduli of these rocks. Fig. 3\n shows the cm-scale structure of the individual sample plugs.\n\n\n4\nPetrophysical characterization methods\n\n4.1\nSample handling, selection, and preparation\nDue to the fissile nature of the shales, special care was taken to prevent sample desiccation. Subjecting shale samples to air and water has tremendous impact on shale properties, and several precautions should be taken to limit such exposure (Ewy, 2015). Water can induce swelling of clay minerals and air can dry out the shale and induce micro-cracking. The CS-D boreholes at Mont Terri were drilled dry using compressed air to cool the drill-bit. Core samples were vacuum sealed in air-tight aluminum foil within hours after they were brought to the surface. The vacuum sealed cores were cast in gypsum to stabilize the cores before drilling sub-sample plugs for permeability and seismic velocity tests. The vacuum sealed cores were only opened right before the plugs were drilled. Plugs were sub-sampled using air drilling with vacuum suction to remove debris from the drill bit (ca. 15\u00a0min per sample). The drilled plug was then immediately vacuum sealed in air-tight plastic. Afterwards, the ends of the sample were cut using a diamond band saw (ca. 15\u00a0min per sample) and immediately vacuum sealed. After any subsequent step in the sample preparation or testing (porosity estimation, permeability measurement, etc.), the plugs would be vacuum sealed in air-tight plastic until immediately before the procedure and sealed immediately afterwards.\nSeveral studies have investigated the water content of the Opalinus shale after various steps in sample preservation. In all cases, the cores were retrieved from boreholes that were drilled from Mont Terri using compressed air to cool the drill-bit, as was the case in the CS-D boreholes. Pearson et al. (2003) summarize a set of measurements that were conducted at various laboratories to assess water content, and found that the shaly facies has an initial water content of 6.0\u20138.6%. Three more recent studies (Amann et al., 2011; Wild, 2016; Wild et al., 2017) compare water content and estimated initial saturation on samples immediately after drilling and after subsequent sample handling (vacuum sealing after drilling), preparation methods that are comparable in technique (air drilling\/sawing of samples and vacuum re-sealing), and duration of air exposure during sample preparation (ca. 30\u00a0min).\n\nAmann et al. (2011) measured the water content of samples immediately after drilling and compared these values to water content measured after cylindrical sub-sample preparation. They observe no change in water content measured before or after sample preparation in samples obtained beyond the EDZ (\n\n>\n\n 5\u00a0m from gallery wall), with water content in all samples ranges between 7.2 and 8.5%. Using a fixed grain density the authors estimate that the corresponding saturation is between 97 and 100%. Wild (2016) measured water content on samples immediately after drilling to be between 7.0 and 8.1%, with one sample outlier (5.3%). The water content of samples after the preparation steps are between 6.1 and 7.5%. These samples have corresponding saturations between 83 and 99%. Wild et al. (2017) obtained water saturation after sample preparation of 6.95\u20137.34% and corresponding initial sample saturation of 88\u2013100%. While the water content after sample preparation in Wild (2016) is slightly lower than the values obtained immediately after drilling, all four studies have water content between 6 and 8.6%. We did not make water saturation measurements on our samples because we wanted to preserve their innate properties and not expose them to drying before testing. While we do not have any direct measurement of water content or saturation in our samples, due to the similar handling times and methods as the studies presented, we believe that we have limited the desiccation of our samples comparable levels, although some sample drying cannot be ruled out. The impact of our sample handling and testing protocol discussed in detail in the methods and discussion sections of this manuscript.\n\n\n4.2\nThin section and XRD characterization\nThin sections were prepared directly from the ends of several samples and observed under optical microscopy. The mineralogical composition of each sample was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) at the ClayLab at ETH Zurich. A detailed description of the sample preparation can be found in Usman et al. (2018). In brief, the samples were milled to <20\u00a0\u03bcm in ethanol using a McCrone mill. After drying at 65\u00a0\u2218C, the samples were ground with mortar and pestle and sieved \n\n<\n\n 200\u00a0\u03bcm to break up the aggregates directly into the sample holder. A randomly oriented powder sample and a textured \u2018smear\u2019 sample to enhance the basal reflections of layered silicates were prepared from the sieved powder for each bulk rock sample. Basal spacing changes in the XRD patterns due to intercalation of organic compounds and after heating (2\u00a0h, 550\u00a0\u2218C) were used to identify the different sheet silicates (Brown, 1982). A Bruker AXS D8 Theta-Theta diffractometer working with Co-K\u03b1 radiation was used. The instrument was equipped with an automatic theta compensating divergence slit and anti-scatter screen for dynamic beam optimization, with primary and secondary soller slits and a LynxEye XE-T line detector. The powder samples were step-scanned at room temperature from 2.5 to 80\u2218 2\u03b8 (step width 0.02\u2218 2\u03b8, counting time 1\u00a0s per step). The qualitative phase composition was determined with the software DIFFRACplus (BRUKER AXS). On the basis of the peak position and their relative intensity the mineral phases were identified in comparison to the PDF-2 data base (International Center for Diffraction Data). The mineral composition of the samples was quantified with the Rietveld program Profex (Doebelin and Kleeberg, 2015).\n\n\n4.3\nDensity, porosity, and permeability measurements\nAfter sample preparation, the testing procedure follows the same order for all samples: 1) density\/porosity measurement, 2) permeability measurements, 3) p-wave velocity measurement, 4) s-wave velocity measurements. If not reported, the measurement was not made due to sample handling issues, but the sequence of other measurements was the same and the same sample were used for all tests.\nBulk rock density and porosity are estimated from sample volume measurements using a helium pycnometer (AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics\u00ae) and mass measurements using a precision balance. These measurements were done on the preserved samples to estimate the pore space that would be available for the gas-permeability measurements. The bulk rock density \n\n\n\u03c1\n\nb\nu\nl\nk\n\n\n\n was calculated as the dry mass divided by the geometrical volume of the sample immediately after removal from the plastic vacuum seal. The geometrical volume is calculated from an average of six measurements of both the length (variation \n\n\u00b1\n\n 0.3\u00a0mm) and diameter (variation \n\n\u00b1\n\n 0.1\u00a0mm) of the sample. The connected porosity (\u03c6) of each cylindrical sample was calculated from the geometrical volume (\n\n\nV\n\nt\no\nt\n\n\n\n) and the sample volume (\n\n\nV\ns\n\n\n) from the helium pycnometer \n\n\u03c6\n=\n\n(\n\n\nV\n\nt\no\nt\n\n\n\u2212\n\nV\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\/\n\nV\n\nt\no\nt\n\n\n\n. Since the samples were originally preserved to limit drying, helium-pycnometry measurements were made under partial saturation conditions.\nPermeability was measured with an inert gas (argon)to avoid any alteration state of the clays and inhibit swelling (Ewy, 2014). Gas permeability was measured using a hydrostatic pressure vessel (detailed description of the apparatus and measurement technique in Wenning et al., 2018). The transient step technique was used with argon to perform and analyze the flow experiments because of the low expected permeability and to prevent swelling of the shale. The testing configuration consists of a cylindrical rock sample between two stainless steel end-caps secured by a soft PVC tube to isolate the sample from the confining fluid. The argon was distributed across the cross-sectional area of the sample by circular grooves on the stainless steel end-caps. A plumbing system connects the end-caps to the upstream and downstream reservoirs, which have volumes of 50.8\u00a0cm3 and 21.2\u00a0cm3, respectively. The gas pressure in the two reservoirs is measured within 0.05% of the measured value. The confining pressure around the sample is regulated within 0.05\u00a0MPa by a screw type displacement pump.\nExperiments were performed at room temperature and an effective pressures of 2 or 3, 5, 7, and 10\u00a0MPa, chosen to represent possible stress conditions in the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory and in the Opalinus claystone at depth (Martin and Lanyon, 2003; Guglielmi et al., 2020). Three to four confining pressure and pore pressure configurations that preserved the same effective pressure were performed to assess the so-called Klinkenberg gas slippage effect (Klinkenberg, 1941). The measurements reported are for the Klinkenberg corrected permeability. The discussion section of this manuscript details the results of these Argon derived permeability values versus the results of measurements using water\/synthetic water in the lab and in the field. For each sample a pressure difference of 0.3\u20130.5\u00a0MPa was imposed between the upstream (\n\n\nP\n\nu\ns\n\n\n\n) and downstream (\n\n\nP\n\nd\ns\n\n\n\n) reservoir and allowed to equilibrate at each of the pore pressure configurations.\nA simple analytical expression (Dicker and Smits, 1988) to estimate permeability from the measured pressure curves was developed and is accurate within 0.3% of the full expression (e.g., Hsieh et al., 1981; Brace et al., 1968) if the pore volume is less than the reservoir volumes, which is true for our experiments. The simple analytical solution:\n\n(1)\n\n\nk\n=\n\n\n\u03b2\n\u03bc\n\u03c6\n\nL\n2\n\ns\n\n\nf\n\n(\n\n\nV\n\ns\na\n\n\n\/\n\nV\n\nu\ns\n\n\n,\n\nV\n\ns\na\n\n\n\/\n\nV\n\nd\ns\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis a function of the compressibility, \u03b2, and viscosity, \u03bc, porosity, \u03c6, length of the sample, L, slope of the linear fit of differential pressure vs. time in semi-log space, s, and a function of the ratio between the volume of the sample (\n\n\nV\n\ns\na\n\n\n\n) and the volume of the up and downstream reservoirs (\n\n\nV\n\nu\ns\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nV\n\nd\ns\n\n\n\n, respectively). Since the pressure difference in the two reservoirs is small we used an average pore pressure to determine the compressibility and viscosity of the argon gas using the National Institute of Standards and Technology database (NIST, 2019).\n\n\n4.4\nElastic wave velocity measurements and calculations\nAnother hydrostatic oil-medium pressure vessel was used to measure the p- and s-ultrasonic elastic wave velocities at high confining pressures using the pulse transmission technique (Birch, 1960). These measurements were always conducted after the permeability measurements to avoid eventual compaction due to high confining pressure because velocity experiments were conducted up to 200\u00a0MPa and at room temperature conditions (detailed description of the measurements described in Zappone et al., 2000; Wenning et al., 2016).\nThe setup is configured so that one transducer transforms the electrical impulse (1\u00a0MHz resonance frequency) and emits an ultrasonic wave at the coupling of the transducer with the sample. The directed mechanical impulse is achieved by mounting a lead zirconate titanate piezoceramic transducer inside a \u2018head\u2019 assembly that also contains a buffer rod, reducing the dispersion of energy. Another transducer converts the ultrasonic wave back into an electrical signal after passing through the sample.\nThe electronic system consists of a Hewlett-Packard\u00ae 214B Pulse Generator that is connected to the transducers with coaxial cables and the output is recorded directly with an oscilloscope. A thin polyolefin heat shrink tube is fitted over the ends of the transducers and the sample to prevent oil seepage from the confining fluid into the sample.\nThe velocity in the rock is given by\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nV\n\np\n,\ns\n\n\n=\n\nL\n\nt\n\ns\na\nm\np\nl\ne\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\nt\n\ns\na\nm\np\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n\nt\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n\u2212\n\nt\n\ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the p- and s-wave velocities, \n\n\nV\n\np\n,\ns\n\n\n\n, are a function of the travel time through the sample, \n\n\nt\n\ns\na\nm\np\nl\ne\n\n\n\n, and its length, L. The travel time through the sample is determined by subtracting the travel time of the cabling in the source\/receiver system, \n\n\nt\n\ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\n\n\n\n, from the total time of flight of the impulses recorded, \n\n\nt\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n\n.\nThe waveforms were recorded at step-wise increases or decreases in pressure in the loading and unloading cycles performed for each p- and s-wave experiment. Measurements were recorded across the pressure range of 5\u2013200\u00a0MPa to investigate the properties closest to present day stress conditions at the Mont Terri (Minimum principal stress \n\n~\n\n 2\u20134\u00a0MPa, maximum principal stress \n\n~\n\n 7\u00a0MPa: Martin and Lanyon, 2003; Guglielmi et al., 2020) and to study the poro-elastic effect on seismic velocities after crack closure at high pressure (Birch, 1960). The measurements were made at room temperature, undrained conditions (i.e., the platens are solid with no pore pressure inlet\/outlet). Recordings of the waveform were measured within \n\n\u00b1\n\n2\u00a0MPa and a travel time accuracy of \n\n\u00b1\n\n0.01\u00a0\u03bcs\uff00 Error associated with compaction due to pressurization have been estimated up to \n\n~\n\n 0.1\u00a0km\/s by measuring sample length before and after measurement.\nVelocity anisotropy (AV\n\np\n) was estimated from the maximum, minimum, and mean velocities using\n\n(3)\n\n\nA\n\nV\np\n\n=\n\n\n\nV\n\np\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\u2212\n\nV\n\np\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nV\n\np\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n+\n\nV\n\np\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n)\n\n\/\n2\n\n\n\u2217\n100\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates of the apparent dynamic elastic moduli were also calculated for each experiment.

The p-wave moduli for the perpendicular (\n\n\nx\n3\n\n\n) and parallel (\n\n\nx\n1\n\n\n) samples are represented by \n\n\nc\n33\n\n\n and \n\n\nc\n11\n\n\n, respectively. Similarly, the s-wave moduli, also known as shear modulus (\u03bc), for the parallel samples are represented by \n\n\nc\n66\n\n\n. The apparent elastic moduli are estimated by applying the isotropic equations to the vertical and horizontal components separately in order to estimate the p- and s-wave moduli (Mavko et al., 2009). The application of the isotropic equations to the separate vertical and horizontal components is shown to be negligible in other shales (Sone and Zoback, 2013). While there are limitations of this simplification, the reported elastic moduli should be considered as apparent moduli. The apparent dynamic Young's moduli are approximated for the parallel (\n\n\nE\n1\n\n\n) components using the following equations:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nE\n1\n\n=\n\n\n\nc\n66\n\n\n(\n\n3\n\nc\n11\n\n\u2212\n4\n\nc\n66\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nc\n11\n\n\u2212\n\nc\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe apparent dynamic Poisson's ratio for the parallel (\n\n\n\u03bd\n1\n\n\n) and perpendicular (\n\n\n\u03bd\n3\n\n\n) sample is calculated using the isotropic equation\n\n(5)\n\n\n\u03bd\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nV\np\n\n\/\n\nV\ns\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n[\n\n\n(\n\nV\np\n\n\/\n\nV\ns\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n1\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thomsen parameters, \u03b5 (Thomsen, 1986), provide an additional measurement of anisotropy using\n\n(6)\n\n\n\u03b5\n=\n\n\n\nc\n11\n\n\u2212\n\nc\n33\n\n\n\n2\n\nc\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nCharacterization\n\nTable 1 describes each of the samples used in the petrophysical study. The porosity, as measured by He-pycnometry immediately after removing the samples from the vacuum sealing varies from 4 to 11%. The bulk density is also similar in all samples, ranging from 2.55 to 2.70\u00a0g\/cm3.\n\nFig. 4\n shows the results of XRD modal composition analysis and thin sections that show typical bedding and fault structures. The XRD results typically have standard deviation of less than 1% (a full breakdown of the composition is available as Supplementary information). The mineral composition analysis shows that most samples have similar compositions, with the exception of sample D1S5-3, whose calcite content is much higher (44\u00a0wt %) and total clay content is much lower (44\u00a0wt %). All the other samples, both from the host rock and Main Fault, are composed of between 9.7 and 12.0\u00a0wt % quartz, have \n\n~\n\n 1\u00a0wt % of both K-feldspar and plagioclase, have calcite content between 7.8 and 24.2\u00a0wt %, and have clay content ranging from 58.3 to 72.1\u00a0wt %. The clays are mostly from the dioctahedral group (sum of illite and muscovite) ranging from 25.2 to 36.8\u00a0wt %, followed by the kaolinite group ranging from 16.0 to 23.8\u00a0wt %, then interstratified illite and smectite ranging from 8.0 to 12.3%, and finally chlorite between 3.7 and 8.8\u00a0wt %.\nThe bedding structure of the high calcite composition sample D1S5-3 is shown in Fig. 4b. The calcite layers cross the width of the thin section and also continue along the length of the sample (cf. Fig. 3). Fig. 4c shows typical structure of the scaly clay fault core and is pseudo-oriented NW-SE from left to right. The sample is composed of different color clay gouge material, with fractures that crosscut the lenses. Much like the larger scale fault structure there are fractures that would form parallel to the trace of the Main Fault, as well as conjugate fracture sets. The different colored clay material forms fish like shear structures. Fig. 4d comes from within the Main Fault core, but shows a contact between an undeformed host rock fragment and the deformed fault material. Unfortunately, the sample is not oriented but it shows that within the Main Fault the contact is discordant. In the host rock section (bottom), the bedding is marked by layering of fine shell fragments, while in the scaly clay section (top) the shell fragments are oriented in random directions.\n\n\n5.2\nPermeability, velocity measurements, and elastic moduli calculation\nThe permeability of the host rock and Main Fault samples is depicted in Fig. 5\na and d and Table 2\n. The permeability for all samples tends to exhibit exponential decay behavior with effective confining pressure. The host rock samples parallel to foliation have permeability ranging from 10\u221217 to 10\u221216\u00a0m2\u00a0at 3\u00a0MPa effective confining pressure which drops to ~ 10\u221219 to 10\u221218\u00a0m2\u00a0at 10\u00a0MPa. The samples from the Main Fault have similar permeability values for the same range of confining pressures. For samples perpendicular to the bedding\/foliation in both host rock and Main Fault, the permeability at 2\u20133\u00a0MPa confining pressure is \n\n~\n\n 10\u221220 to 10\u221219\u00a0m2 and falls to 10\u221222 to 10\u221220\u00a0m2\u00a0at 10\u00a0MPa. For one of the samples within the Main Fault there was no observed pressure connection between the upstream and downstream reservoirs above 5\u00a0MPa confining pressure.\nThe seismic velocity measurements also show similarities between the host rock and the Main Fault samples (Fig. 5). Table 3\n lists the 5, 10, and 200\u00a0MPa velocities (after loading), as well as the linear extrapolation of values at high pressures (with a linear trend) to zero pressures, \n\n\nV\np\n\n0\n\n and \n\n\nV\ns\n\n0\n\n, to estimate the \u2018crack-free\u2019 velocities (e.g., Zappone et al., 2000; Wenning et al., 2016). In general, for the samples parallel to foliation, the \n\n\nV\np\n\n\n is between 3.0 and 3.6\u00a0km\/s at 5\u00a0MPa confining pressure and is 3.9\u20134.2\u00a0at 200\u00a0MPa confining pressure, with the exception of the carbonate-rich sample (D1S5-3) with a velocity at 200\u00a0MPa of 4.7\u00a0km\/s. The \n\n\nV\np\n\n\n perpendicular to foliation ranges from \n\n~\n\n 2.1\u00a0km\/s during loading to \n\n~\n\n 2.6\u00a0km\/s after unloading at 5\u00a0MPa for both rock types. At 200\u00a0MPa the perpendicular sample has a \n\n\nV\np\n\n\n of \n\n~\n\n 3.1\u20133.4\u00a0km\/s. It was only possible to measure \n\n\nV\ns\n\n\n in the samples parallel to bedding\/foliation because the bedding\/foliation-perpendicular samples split along bedding\/foliation planes during sampling and were consequently not long enough to perform the measurements. Both rock types have similar \n\n\nV\ns\n\n\n parallel to bedding\/foliation, ranging from \n\n~\n\n 1.8\u20132\u00a0km\/s at 5\u00a0MPa confining pressure to just over 2\u00a0km\/s at 200\u00a0MPa. The carbonate-rich sample (D1S5-3) from the host rock has a \n\n\nV\ns\n\n\n that is slightly higher.\n\nFig. 6\n shows the range of apparent elastic moduli as boxplots calculated from the \n\n\nV\np\n\n\n and \n\n\nV\ns\n\n\n measurements. For both rock types the apparent Young's modulus parallel to foliation is \n\n~\n\n 22\u201330\u00a0GPa (Table 4\n). The apparent shear modulus parallel to foliation is \n\n~\n\n 10\u00a0GPa. The apparent Poisson's ratio for all samples is \n\n~\n\n 0.27\u20130.3. The larger range in host rock parallel to foliation is driven by the higher velocity measurements in the carbonate-rich samples.\nThe average anisotropy in the host rock and Main Fault caused by aligned minerals in the bedding and foliation is summarized in Table 5\n. The anisotropy (A\n\n\nV\np\n\n\n) was only calculated for \n\n\nV\np\n\n\n because measurements of \n\n\nV\ns\n\n\n could not be made on the perpendicular samples. In general, the mean A\n\n\nV\np\n\n\n is between 28 and 32%, with a low of 23% estimated for the host rock at 200\u00a0MPa and a high of 35% estimated for the Main Fault-\n\n\nV\np\n\n0\n\n. The Thomsen \u03b5 varies from 0.28 to 0.39 in the two rock types and across the pressures measured, with the same outliers in the 200\u00a0MPa host rock (0.21) and Main Fault-\n\n\nV\np\n\n0\n\n (0.51).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion and comparison to field measurements\n\n6.1\nPetrophysical properties and structural relationship\nThe petrophysical properties measured in this study provide a comparison of host rock to fault rock matrix properties from within the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory.\nIn general, the composition of the samples taken from the host rock and from within the Main Fault is very similar. While all samples are from the shaly facies, sample D1S5-3 has elevated calcite content (\n\n~\n\n 44\u00a0wt %) according to XRD analysis, due to the calcite-rich bedding that is visible along the length of the core (Fig. 3). Sample D1S5-4 also has elevated calcite content (\n\n~\n\n 24\u00a0wt %), slightly less than D1S5-3), and also has clear calcite-rich bedding at the plug scale. All other samples from both the host rock and Main Fault have carbonate content of between 7.8 and 19.6\u00a0wt %. The total sheet-silicate content is also very similar, ranging from 61.3 to 72.1\u00a0wt %. The composition of the shaly facies agrees with previous mineralogy estimates (Klinkenberg et al., 2009; Thury and Bossart, 1999). The lack of difference in bulk mineralogy between the Main Fault and host rock samples supports earlier findings from Laurich et al. (2017) who observed that samples from scaly clay domains are microstructurally identical to the host rock, except for the high abundance of \u03bcm-shears. The observation of two different gouge types within the Main Fault corroborates observations from Laurich et al. (2018). Besides the calcite-rich samples, there is no mineralogical control on the petrophysical properties in the Main Fault compared with the host rock due to the similarity. It also appears that there is minimal change in the petrophysical properties due the structural controls since both rock types are similar.\nAs noted in the methods section, the density and porosity measurements were made on preserved samples, not oven dried samples. This was done to best preserve the samples for permeability and seismic velocity characterization. Thus, the measurement with the helium-pycnometer was done at partial saturation as the helium enters the accessible pore space. We measured porosities ranging from 4 to 11%, with a mean of \n\n8\n\u00b1\n2\n\n %. Other porosity measurements done after drying the sample for 24\u00a0h at 105\u00a0\u2218C give values from Mont Terri samples of \n\n12\n\u00b1\n1.4\n\n % (Bock, 2000), 7.6\u201316.1% (Thury and Bossart, 1999), and mean values of 13.5% from the BDB-1 borehole (Yu et al., 2018). The corresponding bulk densities measured in our study range from 2.56 to 2.70\u00a0g\/cm2, with a mean value of \n\n2.62\n\u00b1\n0.06\n\n g\/cm2. Previous measurements on the dry bulk density give estimates of \n\n2.34\n\u00b1\n0.6\n\n g\/cm2, while the grain densities are estimated to be \n\n2.71\n\u00b1\n0.3\n\n g\/cm2 (Bock, 2000). Our measurements, on non-dried saturated samples, fall in with the lower estimates of porosities on dry samples, and the non-dried bulk densities are in between the dry and grain densities.\nThe permeability measured parallel to bedding\/foliation (10\u221218\u201310\u221216\u00a0m2) have similar trends and magnitudes for the measured confining pressures in both the host rock and Main Fault. In comparison, the permeability of both rock type samples measured perpendicular to bedding\/foliation are also similar and ranges from 10\u221222 to 10\u221219\u00a0m2, decreasing with effective confining pressure. The key feature is that permeability is similar regardless of sample orientation the host rock and fault zone. The permeability similarity between core samples in the host rock and main fault is a trend that has also been recently observed with field hydraulic conductivity measurements that show similar behavior between the shaly facies and Main Fault (Yu et al., 2018; Zappone et al., 2020).\n\nMarschall et al. (2005) determined the permeability on two core samples from the host Opalinus claystone (one parallel and one perpendicular to bedding) using water that mimics the pore water composition. Both samples had permeability values of \n\n~\n\n 10\u221221 to 10\u221220\u00a0m2\u00a0at \n\n~\n\n 15\u00a0MPa effective pressure. Bock (2000) report bedding perpendicular permeability of \n\n~\n\n 10\u221220\u00a0m2\u00a0at 4\u20136\u00a0MPa confining pressure (unclear what fluid was used for the measurement). Yu et al. (2018) measured permeability on core samples (presumably with water) is \n\n1\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n21\n\n\n\n to \n\n6\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n20\n\n\n\n m2 for shaly facies and Main Fault samples, which can increase up to 10\u221219\u00a0m2 depending on the cementation factor they used in their estimates. The bedding\/foliation perpendicular measurements that we obtain for both the host rock and Main Fault agree with the bedding perpendicular measurements of the three previous studies on core samples. The bedding perpendicular measurements are also in agreement with measurements being made with and without CO2 as the permeant at similar confining pressures (10\u221221\u201310\u221220), where there was negligible effect of CO2 on the permeability (Minardi et al., 2020). However, the bedding\/foliation parallel measurements that we obtain are significantly higher than the previous studies.\nWe believe that the discrepancy between these studies could be due to either sample handling and preparation causing fracturing and increased permeability, pore water chemistry mismatch causing swelling and decreased permeability, and\/or a combination of the two. We did observe bedding parallel desiccation cracks form in a couple of our samples (Table 1), but the samples maintained its solid structure. These cracks were not through-going and the permeability is not as high as permeability measured on fractured samples (\n\n~\n\n 10\u221217\u201310\u221214\u00a0m2: Jobmann et al., 2010). The desiccation cracks likely cause increases in permeability compared to non-cracked samples, but the measurements made in samples without such visible features also have similar measured permeabilities. Winhausen et al. (2020) measured permeability beginning at 24\u00a0MPa and then decreased down to 6\u00a0MPa and found no change in permeability measured using synthetic brine (\n\nk\n=\n7\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n21\n\n\n\n m2). They suggest that microcracks are effectively closed above 6\u00a0MPa since they do not observe changes in permeability in their measured pressure change. Our measurements during the loading cycle display a pressure dependence from 2 to 10\u00a0MPa, which indicates micro-crack closure throughout the experiment. This is also corroborated by our seismic velocity experiments that have velocities increasing due to micro-crack closure until reaching a linear trend at ca. 30\u201350\u00a0MPa. We also observe velocity decrease during unloading, even after achieving 200\u00a0MPa confining pressure, albeit less than loading. In contrast, the measurements made with water that mimics the in-situ Mont Terri pore water, could have some swelling induced closure of the pores caused by geochemical imbalances of the pore water in the sample and experiment. The in-situ pore water chemistry is very heterogeneous (Pearson et al., 2011), and since these shales are extremely susceptible to changes in pore water chemistry (Ewy, 2014), a slight variation would alter the pores and reduce the permeability. Thus, the discrepancy can be explained by both desiccation and pore water chemistry choices.\nThe measurements in this study perpendicular to bedding match closer to measurements made in the field on both the Main Fault and host Opalinus claystone. The transmissivity of the Main Fault at the CS-D location is between 1 and 7\u00a0\n\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n13\n\n\n\nm2\/s, which corresponds to a permeability of \n\n~\n\n 10\u221221 to 10\u221220\u00a0m2 via single well analytical solutions (Zappone et al., 2020). Marschall et al. (2005) performed in-situ nitrogen gas permeability measurements in boreholes in the host rock at Mont Terri. The measurement process first included re-saturating the borehole with synthetic water, then replacing the water with Nitrogen. The authors found that the intrinsic permeability ranged between 2 and 6\n\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n20\n\n\n\n\u00a0m2 in the host Opalinus. While the laboratory measurements on core samples from the BDB-1 borehole by Yu et al. (2018) match these values, the associated hydraulic conductivity in the laboratory is an order of magnitude less than field measurements using synthetic brine in-situ. They attribute the higher field measurements with local variations of the rock structure, composition and cementation, or the presence of fractures.\nThe discrepancy between the field and the lab, as well as the use of different fluids emphasizes the need to take extreme caution when handling these delicate samples and use these measurements with scrutiny when designing subsurface engineering operations (Ewy, 2015). While we have performed measurements with argon gas and have reported the Klinkenberg correction to give a \u2018liquid\u2019 permeability, the parallel to bedding\/foliation samples show permeability above those observed using water as the permeant. The measurements perpendicular to foliation\/bedding match well with previous measurements. The use of these types of measurements numerical simulations should consider biases in such measurements. It would be beneficial to perform the same permeability measurements on samples of similar composition using different fluids that have been prepared using different methods, for example cores drilled using air-cooled drill-bits versus cores drilled using oil-cooled drill-bits.\nSeismic velocity measurements are in agreement with previous measurements in the host rock at in-situ stress conditions (Wild et al., 2015; Wenk et al., 2008; Bock, 2000; Sarout et al., 2014; Bossart et al., 2018). The higher carbonate content of sample D1S5-3 drives the increase in seismic velocities, which behaves more similarly to the carbonate-rich facies that has higher velocities in general than the shaly facies (cf. Schuster et al., 2018). Much like the permeability measurements, the seismic velocities measured in the host rock and Main Fault have similar behaviors parallel and perpendicular to foliation. The measurements at high velocities (>100\u00a0MPa) correlate to depths of \n\n~\n\n 3.0\u00a0km or more, provide insight for velocity models in the Molasse Basin where the Opalinus claystone occurs at its deepest depths (\n\n~\n\n 2.5\u20133.0\u00a0km) near the Alpine front (Mazurek et al., 2006). The seismic velocity derived apparent-dynamic moduli are also in agreement with measurements on host rock samples (Bock, 2000; Wenk et al., 2008). The higher velocity in the carbonate-rich sample drives the larger range in Young's moduli, Shear moduli, and Poisson's ratio in the host rock compared to the Main Fault.\nThe anisotropy of both the host rock and Main Fault are also quite similar. The A\n\n\nV\np\n\n\n is quite significant at \n\n~\n\n 30% across the range of confining pressures. This anisotropy is in agreement with previous anisotropy measurements in the shaly facies (A\n\n\nV\np\n\n\n\n\n\n~\n\n 20\u201330%) in the lab (e.g., Wenk et al., 2008; Bock, 2000; Sarout et al., 2014; Bossart et al., 2018) and in the field (e.g., Schuster et al., 2018; Zappone et al., 2020). The Thomsen parameter \u03b5 is also similar to other published measurements on Opalinus claystone at 10\u00a0MPa confining pressure (Sarout et al., 2014). In comparison to other shales (Sayers, 2005, and references within), where \u03b5 ranges from 0 to 0.6, the Opalinus claystone falls in the middle with values between 0.28 and 0.39, with the exception of the two outlier measurements (low host rock at 200\u00a0MPa and high Main Fault-\n\n\nV\np\n\n0\n\n). There is a slight decrease in Thomsen parameters for the host rock compared to the fault zone, but it is important to consider that only one measurement perpendicular to the bedding\/foliation is considered in these estimates.\nThe similarities in permeability and seismic velocity in the host rock and Main Fault exhibit atypical behavior compared to the traditional damage zone fault model (Faulkner et al., 2010; Caine et al., 1996). With such a fault, one would expect that the permeability in the fault core would be lower than the surrounding host rock, and the seismic velocities would also decrease due to damage (fracturing) associated with the fault. In the Mont Terri, the protolith of the Main Fault material is the low-permeability shaly facies of the Opalinus clay. Because the Opalinus clay already has extremely low permeability, it would be difficult to create a fault core that has even lower permeability. The low permeability even within the Main Fault suggests that the fracturing around the Main Fault is sealed in most cases. Laboratory studies show that the sealing can either form by calcite precipitation or gouge production (Laurich et al., 2014, 2018) or swelling (Bossart et al., 2018). Field hydraulic conductivity tests within the Main Fault corroborate this suggestion, as the hydraulic conductivity is similar in both host rock and Main Fault (Yu et al., 2018; Zappone et al., 2020).\nHowever, the velocity structure of the Main Fault measured in the field and the laboratory are dissimilar. While we measure similar velocities in the host and fault material, seismic logging (Jaeggi et al., 2018; Schuster et al., 2018) and seismic tomography (Zappone et al., 2020) show that the Main Fault can be identified in the subsurface as a low velocity zone.The seismic logging gives p-wave velocities of ca. 2.5\u00a0km\/s in the host directly adjacent to the fault in the footwall and ca. 2.7\u00a0km\/s in the hanging wall, while the velocity in the Main Fault is ca. 2.1\u00a0km\/s (Jaeggi et al., 2018). The slowest velocities measured in logging occur in the scaly-clay section of the main fault (Jaeggi et al., 2018). From seismic tomography measurements in the CS-D boreholes, the p-wave velocities along bedding is 2.87\u00a0km\/s and 2.28\u00a0km\/s perpendicular to it (Zappone et al., 2020), and estimate an anisotropy of 26%. The authors also note a difference between hanging wall and footwall velocities, although in this case the velocities are higher in the footwall. The parallel and perpendicular velocities in the field are slightly slower than our measurements at 5\u00a0MPa, but the anisotropy is comparable. The low velocity zone detected in the field is due to disorientation of rock forming minerals in the fault and consequent disorientation of the bedding planes. Therefore, seismic waves crosscut the clays at a different angle from host rock, and \u201cread\u201d an intermediate velocity between the maximum represented by measurements parallel to bedding, and the minimum represented by the measurements perpendicular to bedding. The field measurements are also very susceptible to the wavelength of the measurement, the macro- and micro-cracks, as well as the rigidly rotated lenses and microfolds, which exhibit strong energy-attenuation due to these small-scale discontinuities (Jaeggi et al., 2018; Schuster et al., 2018).\n\n\n6.2\nStructural control on critically stressed faults\nDuring the initial hydraulic characterization in the field, a hydraulic pressure connection was observed between the uppermost 1.4\u00a0m of the injection borehole BCS-D1 and the lowermost 3.5\u00a0m of the monitoring borehole BCS-D2 (Zappone et al., 2020). The location of the injection interval and monitoring intervals that observe the pressure response are shown in Fig. 1d. During a step-wise increase in injection pressure up to 4.8\u00a0MPa in the injection interval in BCS-D1, there was a small systematic increase in pore pressure observed in the two lowermost intervals in BCS-D2 (Zappone et al., 2020). There were no changes in pressure in any of the other monitoring intervals. With matrix permeability on the order of 10\u221219 to 10\u221221\u00a0m2, this connection was puzzling because it did not follow the trend of the majority of the mapped fractures and faults within the Main Fault and the orientation of the Main Fault itself (Fig. 1c). However, macroscopic conjugate faults that were identified in other intervals in these boreholes as well as the other boreholes with dips towards the northwest would be favorably oriented for the observed hydraulic connection (Fig. 1). Microscopic fractures are also observable in similar orientations to those mapped in the borehole (Fig. 4). To support the hypothesis that the conjugate faults were responsible for the hydraulic connection, we divided the observed fractures into five fracture families that have similar orientations and determined which faults were critically stressed (Barton et al., 1995). Fractures that are critically stressed (i.e., the stress is above\/closet to the failure criteria) are more prone to be reactivated and transmissive, while those that are not critically stressed are typically sealed.\n\nMartin and Lanyon (2003) determined the regional stress orientation and magnitude in the Mont Terri rock laboratory. They found that the principal stresses are: \n\n\n\u03c3\n1\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a07\u00a0MPa with trend 210\u2218 and azimuth 70\u2218, \n\n\n\u03c3\n2\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0MPa with trend 320\u2218 and azimuth 7\u2218, and \n\n\n\u03c3\n3\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0MPa with trend 52\u2218 and azimuth 18\u2218. A recent fault injection experiment 20\u00a0m from our boreholes found similar in-situ stress orientation and magnitudes (Guglielmi et al., 2020). They found that the principal stresses are: \n\n\n\u03c3\n1\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a06.2\u00a0MPa with trend 210\u2218 and azimuth 86\u2218, \n\n\n\u03c3\n2\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a04.5\u00a0MPa with trend 310\u2218 and azimuth 0\u2218, and \n\n\n\u03c3\n3\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0MPa with trend 55\u2218 and azimuth 4\u2218. To test fracture criticality, we assume Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria that is defined by \n\n\u03c4\n=\n\u03bc\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u2212\n\nP\nf\n\n\n)\n\n+\nC\n\n, where \u03c4 is the shear stress, \u03bc is the friction coefficient, \n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n is the normal stress, \n\n\nP\nf\n\n\n is the fluid pore pressure, and C is cohesion. We have shown that the elastic (seismic velocity) and permeability properties of the Main Fault and the host rock are similar. Therefore, we use host rock strength properties in the critical stress fault analysis when the Main Fault rock properties are unavailable. The friction coefficient of Opalinus claystone is around 24 \n\n\u00b1\n\n\n2\n\u2218\n\n\n (Bossart and Thury, 2008; Orellana et al., 2018). Kakurina et al. (2019) showed that the coefficient of friction has a strong control on failure in shales. Barton et al. (1995) assume a cohesionless fault\/fracture, however cohesion is not always negligible in faults\/fractures (e.g., Krantz, 1991; Muhuri et al., 2003). We consider both cohesive and cohesionless possibilities. In the Opalinus claystone the cohesion parallel to bedding planes is 1.0\u00a0MPa and the minimum cohesion from triaxial testing on Opalinus claystone is 2.2\u00a0MPa (Bossart and Thury, 2008). The background pore pressure in boreholes BCS-D1 and BCS-D2 was observed to be \n\n~\n\n 1.0\u00a0MPa (Zappone et al., 2020). The tensile strength of the Opalinus claystone is 2.0\u00a0MPa (Bossart and Thury, 2008).\nWe used FaultKin8 software to determine the normal and shear stress components on each fault for both of the potential in-situ stress conditions (Marrett and Allmendinger, 1990; Allmendinger et al., 2012; Allmendinger). Fig. 7\n depicts the fracture families in a stereonet plot and as Mohr-Coulomb circles defined by the two different stress regimes with a pore pressure of 1.0\u00a0MPa and different cohesion possibilities. All scenarios have the same friction coefficient ranging from 22\u2218 to 26\u2218. The first failure envelop scenario shows the stress regimes and fracture families assuming cohesionless fracture surfaces. The second failure envelop considers a cohesion similar to the bedding cohesion of 1.0\u00a0MPa. The third scenario considers a cohesion similar to the minimum cohesion from triaxial testing of 2.2\u00a0MPa.\nFor the in-situ stress conditions determined by Martin and Lanyon (2003), the west-dipping fracture family falls at or above the failure envelopes when the failure envelop is defined by a cohesion of 1.0\u00a0MPa or less. In order to bring these fractures to failure where cohesion is 2.2\u00a0MPa, an increase in pore fluid pressure from the in-situ pressure (\n\n\u0394\n\nP\nf\n\n\n) of 3.0\u00a0MPa is required. Regardless of the coehsion parameter, in these in-situ stress conditions the west-dipping fracture set will always fall closer to the failure envelop than the other fracture families, indicating that these fractures are critically stressed (i.e., probably hydraulically conductive).\nFor the in-situ stress conditions determined by Guglielmi et al. (2020), the west-dipping fracture family falls at or above the failure envelope in the cohesionless condition. Under this stress regime the east-dipping fracture family has similar normal and shear stress vectors as the west-dipping fractures and is also at or above the failure envelope. These two fracture families are more critically stressed than the other fracture orientations. If we consider cohesion of 1.0\u00a0MPa, an increase in \n\n\u0394\n\nP\nf\n\n\n of \n\n~\n\n 2.5\u00a0MPa would be required to bring both the west- and east-dipping fractures to failure. For a fracture cohesion of 2.2\u00a0MPa, an increase in \n\n\u0394\n\nP\nf\n\n\n of \n\n~\n\n 3.5\u00a0MPa is required to bring these fractures to failure.\nBoth the west- and east-dipping fractures are not aligned with the trace of the Main Fault. The west-dipping fractures are oriented in a way that would connect the uppermost interval in BCS-D1 with the lowermost interval in BCS-D2, and this connection has been schematically illustrated in Fig. 1d. Since these west-dipping fractures are critically stressed in all scenarios, it is likely that these would have the highest potential for fluid flow.\nThe results of the analysis for both stress estimates are also well in agreement with hydraulic tests performed at the CS-D and FS experiment. For both experiments, the pressure was increased step-wise, and the injection stopped for few minutes. For CS-D a strong pressure decay occurred at a value above 4.5\u00a0MPa (Zappone et al., 2020), while for FS the pressure decay occurred at a value of 5.4\u00a0MPa (Guglielmi et al., 2020). It is important to note that for the latter that the reactivated fracture was dipping south-east according to the recorded slip direction.\nIn both stress regimes the magnitudes and orientations are quite similar, with differences in principal stress magnitude estimates of \n\n<\n\n 1\u00a0MPa and orientations differences of \n\n<\n\n 10\u2218. However, the faults that are most critically stressed differ in both cases emphasizing that minor changes in stress magnitude or orientation have a large impact on which preferential flow pathways are transmissive.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nDrilling of seven boreholes through the Main Fault at the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory enabled direct correlation of structures with petrophysical properties in and around the fault core. Borehole image logging and core mapping constrained the orientation of the Main Fault and several fracture families within the Main Fault. Permeability and seismic velocity measurements show similarities in the host rock and within the Main Fault at varying confining pressures. The similarities in permeability has been observed in field measurements of hydraulic conductivity. However, the Main Fault is marked by a low velocity zone compared to the host rock in sonic logging and seismic tomography, while laboratory measurements show similar values. These differences are explained by the sampling volume, where the scale of the field measurements brings in additional dispersion and intrinsic and geometric attenuation factors of the macro-structures within the fault. Since the laboratory findings shows that permeability parallel to foliation can be two orders of magnitude higher than perpendicular to foliation, and given the critically stressed orientation of the conjugate fracture, it is reasonable to assume that the conjugate fractures can allow better fluid propagation compared to the fractures oriented along the Main Fault.\n\n\nData availability\nThe data including used in this study can be obtained from the following data set DOI: https:\/\/10.3929\/ethz-b-000458394.\n\n\nCompeting interests\nNo competing interests are present.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nQuinn C.

Structural balancing as first described by Dalhstrom (1969) involves checking various compatibility conditions between the observed deformed state and inferred initial state\u2014 for example, testing whether cumulative line lengths of several deformed beds in a cross section are equal. A cross section that passes this test is said to be balanced and thus a permissible interpretation because the section could have resulted from the deformation of an initially continuous flat-lying sequence of beds (Woodward et al., 1989). Modern implementations of these balancing constraints in the form of computer algorithms have made balancing easier (Kligfield et al., 1986; Moretti and Larr\u00e8re, 1989; and several unpublished algorithms within commercial structural modeling packages such as GEOSEC, LithoTect, LOCACE, Move, and StructureSolver), by automating the measurement of geometric quantities and allowing for simple transformations, such as simple (inclined) shear or flexural slip, or some other form of unstraining of a fault block based on a target geometry. Nonetheless, the iterative process of adjusting initial and final geometries remains labor intensive, even with modern workstation packages. A notable exception is StructureSolver, which allows for real-time display of balanced models (Eichelberger et al., 2015).\nEven if a section is balanced and restored, conventional balancing remains fundamentally limited in that, while solutions are permissible, they are non-unique, and the method provides little guidance to distinguish between different permissible solutions. Other constraints are commonly employed, such as independent geophysical datasets, regional stratigraphic relationships and structural style for an area (such as known detachment levels), and basic structural geology concepts---for example, that thrusts generally cut up section in the direction of tectonic transport (Elliott, 1983). Nonetheless, probably the greatest headway into objectively determining the best, balanced interpretations in fold-and-thrust belts (and to a lesser extent extensional settings) has been through theories that relate fold shape and fault shape.\nIt is widely accepted that there is a genetic relationship between folding and faulting for many map-scale structures in the upper crust, such as the structure from the well imaged fold-and-thrust belt in the toe of the Niger Delta shown in Fig. 1\n from Shaw et al. (2005). More specifically that deformation in such systems is accommodated not just by translation and rotation of rocks due to displacement on faults, but also by internal strain within fault blocks. Such strain is commonly manifest as folding related to propagating fault tips (Suppe and Medwedeff, 1990), incompetent thickening and folding associated with detachments (Epard and Groshong, 1995; Poblet and McClay, 1996) and most commonly due to flexural-slip folding of overlying rock layers because of displacements on nonplanar faults (Suppe, 1983). Indeed, such deformation has long been recognized to form the characteristic, recognizable geometry of ramp anticlines in fold-and-thrust belts (Rich, 1934), which are now more commonly termed fault-bend folds (Suppe, 1983). Analogous fault-bend folding relationships have been delineated for extensional fault systems (Xiao and Suppe, 1992). For a comprehensive, recent review of fault-related folding see Brandes and Tanner (2014).\nFault-related folding theories were first implemented as analytical relationships between geometric quantities; these analytical solutions have been applied to great effect extensively in the published literature (Shaw et al., 2005, and others). However, use of such analytical solutions is practically limited to simple, angular cases or requires time-consuming hand construction of sections by expert practitioners. While some natural fault-related fold structures are demonstrably angular (Yue et al., 2005; Hubert-Ferrari et al., 2007) and readily modeled using the analytical solutions, in other cases, observations of rounded fold hinges and progressive change in limb dip are observed (e.g., Tavani et al., 2005; Amos et al., 2007; Benesh et al., 2007), while at other study locations the relative applicability of angular or rounded hinges, and constant or smoothly-varying dips are strongly contested (for example, Ford et al., 1997 and Suppe et al., 1997). These observations require approaches capable of reproducing these commonly observed features. Further strain-based studies of map-scale fault-bend folds appear to provide further support for the observation that strain in these systems is primarily accommodated by flexural slip (Wiltschko et al., 1985) with only second-order deviations, unless thrust sheets were deeply buried (for example, Evans and Dunne, 1991).\nIn order to facilitate easier creation of interpretations of natural structures, algorithms have been implemented to facilitate building balanced forward models of some sub-classes of fault-related folds (Contreras and Suter, 1990; Hardy 1995; Hardy and Ford, 1997; and Allmendinger, 1998; and several unpublished algorithms within commercial structural modeling packages such as GEOSEC, LithoTect, LOCACE, Move, and StructureSolver). The most successful of the published algorithms are perhaps those related to trishear modeling in which numerical solutions have been coupled with inverse modeling approaches (Allmendinger, 1998; Cardozo and Aanonsen, 2009; Oakley and Fisher, 2015). However in the case of fault-bend folding, the focus of this study, extant forward modeling algorithms are characterized by the following limitations: simple flat-ramp-flat geometries (or models that must contain detachments), exclusively angular bends, rigid adherence to line-length conservation in contraction (no local layer thickening or thinning), or, for computational convenience the opposite (unrealistic layer thickening and thinning), use of a single inclined-shear orientation for extensional structures, no real temporal change in deformation during progressive deformation (that is, not a numerical solution), an inability to maintain even approximate layer thickness in folds across imbricated thrust sheets, constant slip across fault bends, and no capacity to simultaneously combine inclined-shear and flexural-slip algorithms into a unified progressive model.\nWe present a flexible kinematic approach to modeling fault-bend folding that resolves the aforementioned shortcomings. We begin by reviewing the geometric solution to fault-bend folding of Suppe (1983), and then extend it to a velocity description of deformation associated with movement over bends in faults. This numerical solution has significant advantages over existing approaches and produces models that capture many of the most commonly observed geometries of fault-bend folds in natural systems; within this single approach, not only can angular fault-related folds be modeled, but rounded faults and folds, parallel contractional folds with only localized bed thinning or thickening, and imbricates that display complex growth strata geometries (Hughes and Shaw, 2014 and others) may also be modeled with equal success. Finally, we generalize contractional and extensional fault-bend folding into a unified theory and explore the heterogeneous strain that occurs in these models during folding.\nThe numerical approach requires several algorithms in order to be fully realized. We have written a program fbfFor to implement this, but it is our intention here to explain these algorithms in sufficient detail that they may implemented in the aforementioned commercial packages which have many existing algorithms and data structures to support structural modeling, or by other researchers in the future.\n\n\n2\nGeometric formulation of fault-bend folding\nFault-bend folding is a common folding process in the upper crust of the Earth that occurs when blocks of rock are displaced over non-planar fault segments (Suppe, 1983). Quantitative relationships between fold and fault shape for these structures allow for the construction of balanced, retrodeformable structural interpretations (Woodward et al., 1989), and facilitate more accurate interpretations of seismic reflection profiles (Shaw et al., 2005). Thus, quantitative modeling of these structures has been widely applied to improve structural interpretations for use in earthquake hazard prediction (Shaw and Suppe, 1996), neotectonics (Lav\u00e9 and Avouac, 2000), hydrocarbon exploration (Gallango et al., 2002), and regional tectonics (Fuentes et al., 2012). Furthermore, fault-bend folding has been shown to likely occur on other terrestrial planets, such as Venus (Connors and Suppe, 2001).\nThe fault-bend folding theory developed by Suppe (1983) is a geometric formulation of the relationship between fold shape and fault shape in contraction, based on the constraints of conservation of line length and orthogonal layer thickness (and by implication conservation of area). The formulation is derived for the case of parallel layers that are folded as a result of displacement over a discrete fault bend (Fig. 2\n) and specifies the resulting changes in dip of bedding and faults, and slip ratios across the bend. Therefore, the geometric solution is a recasting in terms of angles of the contractional balancing criteria for structures that form by fault-bend folding. That is, those interpretations that fully honor the fault-bend folding equations are inherently balanced because they must conserve line length, layer thickness and area. From Suppe (1983) the change in fault dip across a fault bend, \u03c6, is related to the interlimb angle of the fold, \u03b3, and cutoff angle between the fault below the bend and the bedding adjacent to it, \u03b8, by\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c6\n=\n\ntan\n\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\nsin\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\n\n2\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2212\nsin\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\n\n2\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2212\nsin\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2212\nsin\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nThrough the law of sines the ratio, R, of the magnitudes of the output slip, S\n2, to input slip, S\n1, across a fault bend is related to these angles by\n\n(2)\n\n\nR\n=\n\n\n|\n\nS\n2\n\n|\n\n\n|\n\nS\n1\n\n|\n\n\n=\n\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n)\n\n\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\u03c6\n+\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n)\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs per Suppe (1983), sign conventions for these equations are such that for concave \u201csynclinal\u201d bends \u221290\u00b0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b8\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b0, and for convex \u201canticlinal\u201d bends 0\u00b0\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b8\u00a0\u2265\u00a090\u00b0, with 0\u00b0\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c6\u00a0\u2265\u00a090\u00b0, and 0\u00b0\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b3\u00a0\u2265\u00a090\u00b0. The solution with these sign conventions is appropriate for contractional bends (Fig. 2). We generalize this relationship for extensional bends in a later section.\nThis analytical approach has been commonly used to develop balanced subsurface interpretations in fold and thrust belts (e. g. Shaw and Suppe, 1994; and many other studies), and also has allowed for the geometric forward modeling of fault-bend folds (e. g. Mount et al., 1990; Shaw et al., 1999; Shaw et al., 2005). While this methodology is a substantial improvement over conventional balancing in that there exists predictive capability in areas where data are scarce, practical and methodological constraints still limit its application. Because the discrete analytical formulation of the existing method makes it difficult to construct complicated models with multiple, interfering kink bands (Medwedeff and Suppe, 1997), the manual nature of model construction limits its use to seasoned practitioners of the method. Furthermore, the time it takes to construct a single model in practice limits the number of alternative solutions that can be realistically considered. In addition, structures that do not fully honor the conservation of line-length and layer thickness assumptions inherent to the method are not well addressed by the existing formulation. In particular, parallel folds that are generally rounded, such as those that develop over smoothly curving fault-bend folds, are difficult to produce because the simplifying of fault shape into a few discrete fault bends results in models that contain discrete kink bands, which do not always replicate the folds observed in nature. For example, the thrust sheet in Fig. 1 displays a round, parallel fold associated with a curved thrust.\n\n\n3\nNumerical formulation for the kinematics of fault-bend folding\n\n3.1\nFundamental velocity relationship\nSeveral velocity descriptions for forward modeling contractional fault-bend folding have been developed (Johnson and Berger, 1989; Contreras and Suter, 1990; Hardy, 1995; Egan et al., 1999; Hardy and Poblet, 2005). These all essentially make use of the concept of domains of consistent velocity bounded by faults and\/or axial surfaces. However, these existing approaches either are limited to a simple-step fault geometry, do not conserve layer thickness, or otherwise model only a restricted class of structures. Thus, there is a need for a more general approach to modeling fault-bend folding capable of capturing the broader range of structures observed in natural settings.\nWe generalize the velocity description of Hardy (1995) by considering displacement along any fault-bend geometry. As shown in Fig. 3\n the input slip vector, S\n1, before a fault bend can be decomposed into vertical (v\n1) and horizontal (u\n1) velocity components\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nS\n1\n\n=\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nu\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n1\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the fault acts as a boundary condition, motion is parallel to the fault segment with slope \u03b8\n0\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nu\n1\n\n=\n\n|\n\nS\n1\n\n|\n\ncos\n\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n\na\nn\nd\n\n\nv\n1\n\n=\n\n|\n\nS\n1\n\n|\n\nsin\n\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n|\n\nS\n1\n\n|\n\n\n is the magnitude of the slip vector, S\n1. Note that fault slopes are relative to an external Cartesian coordinate reference frame and thus designated with a 0 subscript, unlike the fault-bend fold angle of (1) and (2). For horizontal beds the fault slope \u03b8\n0\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b8, the cutoff angle in (1). Throughout this report a 0 subscript will refer to any angle in the external reference frame. For simplicity here we define u\n1\u00a0\u2265\u00a00. Decomposition of the output slip vector, S\n2 is likewise\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nS\n2\n\n=\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nu\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n2\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nwith the output vertical and horizontal components beyond the bend\n\n(6)\n\n\n\nu\n2\n\n=\nR\n\n|\n\nS\n1\n\n|\n\ncos\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\n)\n\n\na\nn\nd\n\n\nv\n2\n\n=\nR\n\n|\n\nS\n1\n\n|\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c6\n0 is measured counterclockwise from the fault bend, such that \u03c6\n0\u00a0<\u00a00 for convex \u201canticlinal\u201d bends and \u03c6\n0\u00a0>\u00a00 for concave \u201csynclinal\u201d bends. The velocity boundary between these velocity domains, emanating from the fault bend is defined by \u03b3\n0 which is derived from \u03b3 in (1), where |\u03b3\n0\u00a0| =\u00a0\u03b3, for horizontal beds in contraction (Fig. 3), and 0\u00b0 > \u03b3\n0 \u2265 90\u00b0 for convex \u201canticlinal\u201d bends and \u221290\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b3\n0 < 0\u00b0 for concave \u201csynclinal\u201d bends. This orientation, S\n2\u2013S\n1, satisfies the block-contact condition Waltham and Hardy (1995) where adjacent areas of different velocities should have no gaps or overlaps during deformation and serve as a boundary condition to the different velocity domains, just as faults act as a boundary condition. The velocity boundary is analogous to the active axial surface for the geometric solution of Suppe (1983) where layers are folded (strained) as their velocity changes. For one fault bend there thus exists two velocity domains on either side of this velocity boundary, and all material (e. g. lines or points) moves with the same velocities, S\n1 or S\n2, within one of the velocity domains (Fig. 4\n).\nNote that the slip ratio, R, in (2) is the ratio of the magnitudes input and output slip so we can state these output velocities in terms of the input slip magnitude, fault shape, and interlimb angle by\n\n(7)\n\n\n\nu\n2\n\n=\n\n\n\n|\n\nS\n1\n\n|\n\ncos\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\n)\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n)\n\n\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\u03c6\n+\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n)\n\n\n\n\na\nn\nd\n\n\nv\n2\n\n=\n\n\n\n|\n\nS\n1\n\n|\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\n)\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n)\n\n\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\u03c6\n+\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the boundary conditions of conservation of layer thickness and line length, \u03b3 is implicitly related to \u03c6 and \u03b8 by (1) and can be solved iteratively. For successive bends, the previous output slip can be considered the input slip for the next bend, with corresponding \u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b3, and R for that bend. The new \u03b3 is still determined relative to the fault bend, but because the beds are generally not flat when entering the velocity boundary, \u03b3\n0 in the external Cartesian reference frame will generally not be equal to \u03b3 and has to be computed, based on \u03b8. For cases where no solution exists for \u03b3, such as large anticlinal bends or interfering kink bands, a \u03b3 \u2032 is employed to allow for changes in layer thickness and line length (as discussed later). Thus, the velocities are a function entirely of the initial slip, fault shape and bed geometry relative to the fault. For thrust-fault shapes in which the fundamental fault-bend fold equations are valid, (4) and (7) produce hanging wall fault-bend folds that conserve cross-sectional area, layer thickness, and line length identical to Suppe (1983), see Fig. 5\na.\n\n\n3.2\nAlgorithmic implementation of the velocity solution\nThere are conceivably many ways to implement the above velocity solution algorithmically. Successful implementations would handle all model parameters and in particular the fact that cutoff angles may change during the progressive development of a fault-bend fold (Suppe, 1983), and thus the velocities and velocity boundaries may change during progression of a model. We present a method here based on computation occurring over a series of discrete time steps. Such an approach also allows for other time-dependent processes, such as deposition of syntectonic (growth) strata associated with fault-bend folding (Fig. 5), subsidence, compaction, and erosion. For this numerical approach we discretize the input slip into an incremental slip S\n1 and compute \u03c6, \u03b8 and \u03b3 at each time step for all points before a fault bend. Output slip S\n2 at this time step, and all associated new fault-bend angles are likewise computed progressively across the initial and subsequent bends (Figs. 4 and 5).\nLayers are treated as polylines composed of multiple linear segments bounded by two points (Fig. 4b). Pregrowth layers, the layers present before deformation commences, are assigned an initial geometry (lateral extent, height, and dip), and growth layers are created at a given time step based on assigned ages. Growth layers are similarly assigned a lateral extent, height, and dip, and truncate at preexisting layers if those layers are present at that height. Every point in every layer lies within a velocity domain as defined by the velocity boundaries (Fig. 4a). At subsequent time steps the points may move from one velocity domain to another if they cross a velocity boundary (compare red circles in Fig. 4b with 4c), but they always stay associated with their original layers, and their original ordination with respect to each other, unless a fault is imposed. The displacement of points within one velocity domain occurs by adding the incremental slip vector S for that domain to the existing position of the points (Fig. 4c). Faults are treated as polylines with points at each fault bend. Deformation is confined to the hanging wall. The footwall is considered fixed to an external reference frame, unless subsidence or compaction occurs.\nAs explained in the previous section, the equations that govern the velocity boundaries are a function of the fault-bend fold angles \u03c6, \u03b8, and \u03b3; thus, these angles need to be computed at every time step. For the first time step we use \u03b8\n0\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b8. For subsequent time steps all segments within the previous velocity domain before a fault bend are treated as potential cutoff orientations and the Euclidian distance between the mean position of each segment and the fault bend is calculated. The orientation of the closest segment (shown in Fig. 4b as the green segment) is used to solve for \u03b8. The motivation for choosing the closest segment to the fault bend is that parallel fault-bend folding (flexural slip) is plausibly controlled by mechanical bedding anisotropy near a fault bend where deformation is occurring. In most geometric constructions of fault-bend folding this is implicit. Other more elaborate determinations for the cutoffs, such as weighted means for all segments, could be implemented and would be an interesting area of future study. Other segments near a fault bend will generally share this orientation, and those farther away may be less likely to have this orientation, whether because they are growth strata or simply because of changes in bedding orientation from folding in previous time steps. This has implications for layer-parallel strain, as discussed in a later section. Thus, for each time step new velocity boundaries are computed, and points are assigned to distinct velocity domains based on their positions relative to the velocity boundaries. The cutoff orientations that govern the velocity boundaries for that time step are shown as green ticks adjacent to the fault bends shown in Fig. 4c and several subsequent figures. The particle paths for select particles are shown as olive-green lines in Fig. 5 and many subsequent figures. These are relative to an external reference frame, thus these shown motion parallel to the fault. The footwall is fixed with respect to the external reference frame, thus without motion, and plot as fixed points.\nThis incremental computation is perhaps the fundamental distinction between the approach presented here and previous forward kinematic-modeling approaches to fault-bend folding because phenomena such as changes in the fault-bend fold angles that may evolve throughout progressive development of the structure are automatically handled. That is, velocity boundaries may change despite input incremental slip and fault shape remaining the same throughout deformation. For example, this approach solves for the change in cutoff \u03b8, and the corresponding necessary change in interlimb angle \u03b3 at the anticlinal bend, that results when material is transferred up the ramp, and material from the back limb reaches and then surpasses the upper bend refolding the dip panel to flat as material is translated along an upper detachment (Fig. 5a; and the switch in active axial surfaces A and B\u2019 of Suppe, 1983, his Fig. 3, and in the creation of degenerate axial surfaces 12BT and 12BL of Medwedeff and Suppe, 1997, their Fig. 10). Further slip results in only widening of the flat panel on the crest of the structure as the front limb is translated along the upper flat. Beyond this extreme example, the necessity to incrementally compute velocities and associated dependent variables is actually a fundamental requirement to producing nominally parallel folds with rounded hinges in cases with more subtle fault bends and cutoff geometries because the cutoff angles are potentially changing through many fault bends as deformation progresses, as discussed in a subsequent section.\nAs is common in most numerical approaches, the discretization can result in modeling artifacts. For example, in this framework a segment can span a velocity boundary, and thus can have an ephemeral history that deviates from the overall history (Fig. 4b and c). In the case of Fig. 5a the minor, faint bands of extension or contraction in the pregrowth strata are an artifact of the size of the segments. Using smaller segments (more points per layer) and more time steps can minimize the artifact, but there is a trade off in using very small segments because cutoff determinations may deviate from the general overall dip of the layers entering a bend in complicated models. Furthermore, computational time increases linearly with more segments. Such a modeling artifact is not the origin of any appreciable layer-parallel strain shown in the models. Segments within the velocity domain that are parallel to the segment used for the cutoff determination will be folded with no layer-parallel strain; segments with other orientations will show layer-parallel strain. We explain in detail in a subsequent section why this the case, and the layer-parallel strain that may result.\n\n\n3.3\nSimple flat-ramp-flat\nThe angular fold in Fig. 5a is the result of the angular fault shape. That is, there are two bends in the fault, and thus two changes in velocity with associated folding at the velocity boundaries. The particle paths show the velocities as the deformation progresses. These paths are composed of discrete angular sections because they mark the motion parallel to the angular fault. Inspection of the layer-parallel strain shows there is no strain in the pregrowth strata. Because area and line length are conserved layer thickness is also conserved. The pregrowth portion of the fold is parallel and deformed by flexural slip because all of the pregrowth beds entering a velocity boundary were parallel, and thus after passing through the velocity boundary remained parallel. Much of the growth strata likewise are parallel to the pregrowth strata where deposited concordant to the pregrowth layers.\nThe substantial strain in regions of the growth results from growth panels that were deposited flat-lying over dipping pregrowth, and then were refolded at the upper bend. As discussed in the previous section, the velocities are governed by the geometry of the pregrowth cutoff angle near the fault bend. Beds in that velocity domain that are in a different orientation do not deform by flexural slip and are sheared. This implementation is the same result as the geometric solution that Suppe et al. (1992) devised for folding growth triangles. More complicated kinematics could be implemented, such as initiating another fault at the growth-pregrowth unconformity boundary because of a change in cutoff angles in order to maintain parallel folding throughout the model. This would require a change in the orientation of the velocity boundary at the growth-pregrowth boundary, and recalculation of fault-bend fold angles associated with this new fault. We show in a later section how a similar approach can be implemented for the case of imbrication, but a full treatment with respect to growth strata is beyond the scope of this study. Furthermore, we think this is unlikely in most cases. In our view the first-order, simple, base case is appropriate in most cases, where the preferred velocity boundary orientation is dictated by the angle that allows for parallel folding of competent pregrowth strata, while the bedding of young, more-poorly consolidated growth strata that are farther from the fault bend have far less mechanical influence on the deformation and are sheared.\n\n\n3.4\nCurved faults and rounded-hinge, parallel folds\nIn prior approaches, the balancing of curved thrust ramps has been accomplished by using a center of rotation to move blocks and minimize shear to localized regions (Erslev, 1986; Seeber and Sorlien, 2000 leading to long back limbs for relatively small displacements above gently curving ramps. A rounded-hinge kinematic formulation without changes in layer thickness or line length, but with a leading-edge loose-line, has likewise been developed by Tavani et al. (2005). In the approach presented here curved faults and folds are modeled within a unified framework of a general fault-bend folding solution. The fault in Fig. 5b is composed of 6 bends instead of the 2 bends of the angular flat-ramp-flat model of Fig. 5a. This approximates a curved fault, and the curved fold in Fig. 5b that results from application of this method shows almost complete parallel behavior for the pregrowth layers. A curved fault results in a curved fold because many cutoff angles with small fault bends are governing the velocity boundaries which essentially sweep through the progressive fold development. That is, just like the major change from ramp to flat, as each folded dip panel reaches the next bend a new cutoff angle \u03b8 is computed, with corresponding new fault bend \u03c6 and interlimb angle \u03b3 at each time step. If there are several small fault bends, such as in Fig. 5b, the passage of beds through them results in correspondingly small changes in the fold shape, and a rounded fold results. Thus, the particle paths are more curved because they move parallel to a curved fault. Furthermore, the models show the refolding of the back limb to a widening flat crest during progressive displacement on the fault, like the angular model. Inspection of the layer-parallel strain shows almost no strain in the pregrowth layers through the progressive development of the fault-bend fold (Fig. 5b). As with the angular model of Fig. 5a, the growth strata are strained in places because they were deposited flat-lying over dipping pregrowth, and deform by non-flexural-slip folding. Because this shearing occurs over multiple bends, the resulting strain is more diffuse than in the angular case.\n\n\n3.5\nDeviation from parallel behavior\nThe models such as those in Fig. 5 that result from solving (1) and (2), termed \u201cparallel behavior\u201d by Suppe (1983), were motivated by the fact that in contractional regimes folding within thrust sheets is usually observed to be parallel (e. g. Fig. 1). Dahlstrom (1969) used the geometric test of consistent line lengths because it was more tractable, but he explicitly points out that this is because layer thickness and area are assumed to have not changed significantly (i.e., mostly parallel behavior). As in Dahlstrom (1969) and Suppe (1983), most studies of fold and thrust belts are predicated on the assumption that while these approaches are applicable to first-order structures, local, second-order deviations from parallel behavior are common.\nMany existing modeling approaches for fault-related folds have explored either distributed or localized shear in portions of structures. Suppe (1983) in fact addressed shearing associated with non-layer-parallel slip in the front limbs of imbricate fault-bend folds. Many fault-propagation folding models have incorporated shear into their formulation or investigated the role of distributed shear in fault-propagation fold geometry (Jamison, 1987; Mitra, 1990; Suppe and Medwedeff 1990; Mosar and Suppe 1992) most likely motivated by the fact that layer-thickness variations are more commonly observed with this class of structures. Additionally, most trishear models result in changes in layer thickness, particularly in the footwall, during trishear fault-propagation folding (Erslev, 1991; Hardy and Ford, 1997; Allmendinger, 1998). Models that describe detachment folds, such as Epard and Groshong (1995), also call upon layer-parallel strain to describe the deformation in at least the cores of these structures. No general theory, however, exists for fault-bend folding that allows for local, modest deviation from parallel behavior. Such an approach would provide a more flexible technique that would provide practitioners with the ability to evaluate whether or not strict adherence to line-length balancing constraints were desirable or appropriate for modeling natural structures.\nRecall that a change in velocity across a fault bend is defined by \u03b3\n0. Because S\n1 and S\n2 are displacement vectors, the vector difference between these, S\n2\u2013S\n1, is the orientation of the velocity boundary (Fig. 3), with an appropriate magnitude needed to close the vector circuit. Use of this vector difference is analogous to the restoration vector solution of Novoa et al. (2000) for growth fault-related folds. Any other orientation of velocity boundary from 0\u00b0 > \u03b3\n0 \u2265 90\u00b0 for an anticlinal bend or \u221290\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b3\n0 < 0\u00b0 for concave synclinal bends is permissible in order to still honor the block-contact condition, and therefore conserve area. Imposition of a different orientation for S\n2\u2013S\n1 will however result in a new S\n2 magnitude, thus resulting in a change in line length, i. e. layer-parallel strain, as well as a different position for the leading edge of the deformed block (Fig. 6\n). The vector difference, S\n2\u2013S\n1, during folding can be applied to bed lengths if they themselves are considered as vectors (Fig. 6b\u2013g) for a given input slip such that the initial bed length, l\n1 is folded to bed length, l\n2 by vector addition\n\n(8)\n\n\n\nl\n2\n\n=\n\nl\n1\n\n+\n\nS\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nS\n1\n\n,\n\n\n\nand the layer-parallel strain, e expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the bed vectors\n\n(9)\n\n\ne\n=\n\n\n\n|\n\nl\n2\n\n|\n\n\u2212\n\n|\n\nl\n1\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\nl\n1\n\n|\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 6a shows contours of constant layer-parallel strain for the case of identical fault geometries, of |\u03b8 |\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c6, with varying velocity boundaries |\u03b3\n0|\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b3 '. For an anticlinal bend this is a simple step to a d\u00e9collement. Suppe (1983) showed that the solution of (1) is doubled-valued in \u03b3 for the anticlinal case, with larger \u03b3 (mode 1) and smaller \u03b3 (mode 2) possible shapes for the fold. The line of e\u00a0=\u00a00 in Fig. 6a is the familiar case from Suppe (1983) of calculating \u03b3 from (1), shown in Fig. 6c. This is equal to \u03b3\n0 for the horizontal beds, and for simplicity we use this geometry for all the models in Fig. 6. For the case of \u03b8\u00a0\u2264\u00a030\u00b0, bed thinning and lengthening occurs where \u03b3 '\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b3 (Fig. 6b), and thickening and shortening where \u03b3 '\u00a0<\u00a0\u03b3 (Fig. 6d). Like Suppe we focus here on the mode 1 case because these are the most commonly observed fault-bend fold geometries. The double-valued nature of (1) results in no solution for \u03b8\u00a0>\u00a030\u00b0. For these larger fault bends, with any imposed \u03b3 \u2032, bed thinning and lengthening occurs (Fig. 6a). Nonetheless, inspection of Fig. 6a shows that e is double-valued for \u03b8\u00a0<\u00a045\u00b0, and there exists a minimum elongation, and an associated \u03b3 \u2032 from this can be computed. In our implementation, we default to this minimum elongation, but also allow any other imposed \u03b3 \u2032 from the user. In the examples section we show why this may be necessary in order to match observed fault-bend folds. For a synclinal bend a similar line of -\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c6 is present where e\u00a0=\u00a00, and that bed thinning and lengthening occurs where \u03b3 '\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b3 (Fig. 6e), and thickening and shortening where \u03b3 '\u00a0<\u00a0\u03b3 (Fig. 6g).\nMore generally, for all constant differences between fault cutoffs relative to fault bends |\u03b8 |\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0n, where n is the angular difference between \u03b8 and \u03c6, there exists a line of no layer-parallel strain that is the solution to (1) and is double-valued with respect to \u03b3 (Fig. 7\n). Similar trends in layer-parallel strain occur across this boundary: bed thinning and lengthening occurs for \u03b3 ' > \u03b3, and thickening and shortening for \u03b3 ' < \u03b3, and for an anticlinal bend a maximum \u03b8 exists for that fault bend \u03c6 beyond which bed thinning and lengthening occurs for all \u03b3 '.\n\nFig. 6a shows that where \u03b3 '\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b3 \u00b1 10\u00b0 the amount of layer-parallel strain is modest. For example, in the anticlinal bend case shown in Fig. 6, \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c6\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 for the case of a steeper velocity boundary \u03b3 '\u00a0=\u00a085\u00b0, layers are thinned and beds are lengthened by 3.8% (Fig. 6b); for a shallower velocity boundary \u03b3 '\u00a0=\u00a070\u00b0, beds are thickened and shortened by 5.5% (Fig. 6d). Similar ranges of LPS are observed in synclinal bend models: beds lengthened 5.4% for \u03b3 '\u00a0=\u00a085\u00b0 (Fig. 6e), and shortened 6.0% for \u03b3 '\u00a0=\u00a070\u00b0 (Fig. 6g). This minor sensitivity of layer-parallel strain for high \u03b3 \u2032 and low \u03b8 and \u03c6 is significant because most fault bends in contraction reside in this range of the parameter space, particularly for small changes in fault angle, that is, curved faults. Thus, using this approach it is possible to model contractional fault-bend folds that deviate locally from parallel behavior, but are for the most part parallel, while always maintaining cross-sectional area, in an explicit way, to match for example an outcrop where LPS is observed in a thrust sheet, or to evaluate the magnitude of LPS implied by matching an observed structural geometry and layer thickness changes in seismic reflection data. The imposing of \u03b3\n0 is closely related to the deformation of the growth strata in Fig. 5. The strain that results in the growth strata is the result of some of the beds being sheared because they lie in an orientation other than the one prescribed by flexural slip during the deformation. We explore the important aspect of layer-parallel strain in more detail later, but first we complete our fundamental velocity solution for fault-bend folding by including extensional fault-bend folding within this framework.\n\n\n\n4\nGeneralization to extensional fault-bend folding and inclined shear\nExtensional fault-bend folding shares many commonalities with contractional fault-bend folding, but differs in a fundamental way. It is observed in many natural structures that layer thickness is not conserved as rocks are displaced across extensional bends, and that the orientation of axial surfaces that divide regions of homogenous dip are oriented in a direction consistent with Coulomb shear with the maximum compressive stress being generally vertical. Thus, in the most commonly-applied method, extensional fault-related folding is modeled as folding that is accomplished by simple shear inclined at an orientation of about 60\u201370\u00b0 relative to the earth's surface (White et al., 1986; Dula, 1991; Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Shaw et al., 1997), although other workers have explored variations in this angle including considering vertical inclined shear (Nunns, 1991; Poblet and Bulnes, 2007). In this section, we demonstrate how the previously described contractional fault-bend folding velocity approach, indeed the same equations, may be generalized to accommodate extensional fault-bend folding through inclined shear.\nThis generalization can be made provided we modify the sign conventions from contractional fault-bend folding so that for the extensional fault bend 0\u00b0\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c6\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u221290\u00b0 (Fig. 8\n). As in contraction for concave \u201csynclinal\u201d bends \u221290\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b8\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b0, and for convex \u201canticlinal\u201d bends 0\u00b0 > \u03b8\u00a0\u2265\u00a090\u00b0, and 0\u00b0 > \u03b3\u00a0\u2265\u00a090\u00b0, and where \u03b3 is the inclined shear orientation, and the cutoff \u03b8 is from horizontal. With this change, (2) is fully valid (see Fig. 8), and the slip ratio, R, can be computed. The use of the same equation (2) through (7) with these sign conventions allows for a velocity modeling of extensional fault-bend folding that produces folds and associated growth triangles, similar to the geometric solution of Xiao and Suppe (1992) as shown in Fig. 9\n. Because an inclined shear orientation \u03b3 \u2032 is always imposed, \u03b3 '\u00a0=\u00a0|\u03b3\n0|. Deviation from conservation of line length and layer thickness will occur, but not cross-sectional area. In fact, inclined shear results in significant layer-parallel strain for all beds that move through a velocity boundary, except for the degenerate case in which beds are parallel to the velocity boundary. For example, in Fig. 9a we use a \u03b3\n0\u00a0=\u00a065\u00b0, and layer-parallel extension is particularly high (up to 60%) for beds that have moved through more than one fault bend (Fig. 9a). The strain in folded growth strata is particularly clear in the growth triangles in the model. As per Xiao and Suppe (1992) we use antithetic inclined shear orientation for \u03b3\n0 for concave bends, where 0\u00b0\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b3\n0\u00a0\u2265\u00a090\u00b0, and synthetic inclined shear orientation for \u03b3\n0 for convex bends, \u221290\u00b0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b3\n0\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b0, in order to maintain an extensional sense of shear (Fig. 9). In extensional convex bends in order for the block-contact condition to hold, it is clear that |\u03b3\n0|\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b8 must be honored, and practically |\u03b3\n0| should be much larger than \u03b8, or very significant strain occurs as the beds deform across the steepening bend in the fault.\nIn the models of Fig. 9, a subsidence was imposed such that the accommodation space is filled by the deposited growth strata. Because the particle paths are relative to an external reference frame, the hanging-wall particle paths are now the vector sum of that due to folding and subsidence. The footwall particle paths show simple subsidence. Within the framework of the velocity-based approach described herein, this simply represents an additional uniform motion relative to the external reference frame. Such a uniformly applied component to the velocity field does not change the geometry or strain discussed here; it is, however, more representative of the real-world reference frame that typifies the formation of extensional fault-bend folds, and further provides the initial framework for future implementation of more complex patterns of subsidence and accommodation. Compaction could also be represented in this velocity-field based framework. However, because compaction induces a strain that would obscure the point being made here of strain associated with displacement over extensional bends, it has not been applied in the models shown in this manuscript.\nThus, the approach outlined herein provides a unified algorithmic representation capable of accurately modeling both flexural slip and inclined shear, providing a generalized approach that allows these mechanisms to be simultaneously utilized in modeling a single cross-section or even individual structure. All that is needed to determine extensional from contractional bends is to consider the sense of motion on the fault segment before a bend. We define fault segments with \u03b8\n0\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u22123\u00b0 as contractional bend and those with \u03b8\n0\u00a0<\u00a0\u22123\u00b0 as extensional. The reason for this somewhat arbitrary, non-zero distinction is that some detachments may subtly cut down section and we have found this alleviates imposing inclined shear related to undulating detachments when it is not necessary, or desirable. By casing for fault-bend type (contractional or extensional), and when extensional imposing a specific magnitude of the inclined shear angle, it is trivial to use the same equations and kinematically model a linked system in one cross section, such as is commonly observed in passive margin settings where inclined shear is observed associated with rollover anticlines on the shelf with toe thrust structures that tend to deform by flexural slip (Damuth, 1994).\n\n\n5\nStrain associated with fault-bend folding\nWe have already touched on the layer-parallel strain associated with folding as beds move over non-planar faults such as in contractional growth strata (Fig. 5), and virtually all extensional bends (Fig. 9). Displayed in Fig. 10\n are the finite strain for all orientations within the finite strain ellipses during progressive displacement over a fault bend in extension (Fig. 10a) and contraction (Fig. 10b). Fields of extension within the strain ellipses are in red, and fields of contraction in blue, with magnitude proportional to the color saturation, as with the layer-parallel strain displays. The orientations of no finite strain are white. During the displacement, beds that have experienced only translation show undeformed strain ellipses and all orientations exhibit no finite strain, as expected. Strain is recorded only in the discrete fold limb as a progressively widening simple shear band whose boundary is oriented parallel to the velocity boundary.\nFor the extensional bend (Fig. 10a), one orientation of no finite strain within the fold limb is oriented parallel to the velocity boundary as is required in simple shear, and at a high angle to the layers, as is appropriate for applications of inclined shear (Xiao and Suppe, 1992, and others). The other orientation is not particularly relevant to layer-parallel strain across an extensional fault-bend because with consistent antithetic inclined-shear orientation over a concave bend, initially horizontal layers are in the fields of extension of the strain ellipse throughout deformation (Fig. 10a). This is true for typical, gentle, primary stratigraphic dips. As beds move through additional concave bends, they remain in the fields of extension, and thus continue to extend and record significant layer-parallel elongation (Fig. 9a). Synthetic shear across a convex bend will result in a similar lengthening of the layers throughout the displacement history (Fig. 9b) for gently dipping incoming beds, for the same reason---that they lie in the fields of extension throughout their deformation. For certain fault-bend geometries the other orientation of no finite elongation in inclined shear can approach the fault dip beyond the bend. This could result in complex, subsidiary faulting that approaches the second no-finite-strain orientation, as seen in some analog models of rollover structures (Cloos, 1968). This complexity is not modeled here, but would be an interesting area for further research both from a mechanical and kinematic standpoint.\nIt might seem apparently sensible to use an analogous Coulomb shear orientation for the velocity boundary in contractional structures, with the maximum compressive stress assumed to be generally horizontal such as has been proposed by Lingrey and Vidal-Royo (2015) for inclined shear restoration of contractional structures. However, the fact that parallel (or approximately parallel) folding dominates in thrust sheets suggests that layer anisotropy dominates in flexural slip deformation, and it is the ramp that may be more reflective of that angle. Parallel fault-bend folding results in a shear parallel to bedding and a rotation of the beds at the fault bend (Suppe, 1983), but this is also equivalent to a shear parallel to the axial surface (De Paor, 1994). Thus, the velocity boundary (active axial surface of Suppe) is that orientation for which an overall shear is equivalent to this bedding-parallel shear and a rotation of the beds, and that still creates a parallel fold. That is, in this formulation it is inclined shear with an angle determined by (2) through (7), and because layer thickness is conserved this orientation for the contractional case is the orientation of no finite strain oriented parallel to the velocity boundary. The other orientation of no finite strain is that parallel to bedding (Fig. 10b).\nNotably, in the case of multiple bends with small phi (that is, curved faults), the complex finite strain still results in mostly parallel folding and thrust sheets with significant internal strain limited to a few regions of the structure, such as in the steep front limb (Fig. 11\n). Notice that one orientation of no finite strain is parallel to the beds for the most part. In general, the other orientation is not parallel to any one velocity boundary. This is because during the deformation, the velocity boundaries have changed as several folded beds encounter new fault bends with new cutoffs (Fig. 11a). The finite strain ellipses therefore express heterogeneous strain from a complex deformation path. Significant (close to 20%) local layer-parallel strain exists in the fold in Fig. 11b, particularly in the steep front limb. The resultant thrust sheet geometry therefore exhibits primarily parallel behavior with important, but local, deviations, characteristic of observations from natural thrust sheets in many fold-and-thrust belts. The key insight is that this has been accomplished without change in input slip or fault shape during the deformation, and with default solutions for \u03b3 based on \u03b8 and \u03c6. Furthermore, no loose line is created; that is, strain is confined to the folded beds, and there is no required affine shear.\nThis visualization provides insight into the practice of choosing pin lines for flexural-slip unfolding, commonly employed in cross section restoration (Lingrey and Vidal-Royo, 2015 and references therein). Standard practice is to choose flat beds as a location for the pin line, as there is assumed to be no bedding parallel shear. For discrete fault bends (Fig. 10b), choosing the orientation of no finite elongation in the fold limb, which is also the velocity boundary orientation would likewise result in no loose line. For beds that have moved through multiple bends however, there is not necessarily one orientation (Fig. 11a). The orientation of the line of no finite strain, and thus appropriate pin, is close to vertical, but changes throughout a limb. Furthermore, even though the fold is mostly parallel there is local layer-parallel thickening. Thus, a non-vertical loose line in the undeformed state would likely occur regardless of the pin location because of differing amounts of thickening and thinning for different layers. This is more simply portrayed in the models of Fig. 6. The models are area balanced, but line-length balancing of models such as these would result in a loose line, not from affine shear but because some of the cutoff beds have differing extents to which they have experienced LPS. In more complicated fault-bend folds such as in Fig. 11 the use of line-length balancing of beds could thus lead to an interpretation of affine shear to a thrust sheet when in fact local bed thinning and lengthening has instead occurred. It is no wonder that during classical line-length balancing of cross sections with rounded thrust sheets and imbrication typical of natural systems, the use of pins for unfolding sometimes results in an undesirable loose line.\nThe generalization presented here is that all fault-bend folding in this formulation can be thought of as due to heterogeneous inclined, simple shear, and that flexural slip in contractional fault-bend folds is a special case of multi-orientation inclined shear where defined lines of no finite strain result in conservation of layer thickness and line length. Thus, one does not need to choose between flexural-slip or inclined-shear approaches when modeling areas that have experienced fault-bend folding; both can be represented in a heterogeneous inclined, simple-shear framework. This allows for simultaneous extension and contraction to be modeled, such as in linked structures in gravity-driven passive margin deformation (Damuth, 1994). This also allows for deformation of complex orientations when the dip of beds change with depth and no flexural-slip solution is possible without the creation of additional faults (such as the growth strata examples discussed above) but still maintains area balance. More importantly, deviations from flexural slip can be incorporated purposefully by defining the velocity boundary independently of the solution for (1), which is required to model steep ramps, multiple bends, imbrications, and localized high-strain regions as we discuss in the examples section below.\n\n\n6\nFurther considerations of the velocity solution\n\n6.1\nVelocity boundary interference\nBecause the velocity boundaries in these models are commonly not parallel there exists the potential for boundaries that cross each other. Thus, a full solution that conserves cross-sectional area must take into account the slip vectors associated with overlapping velocity domains. Inspection of the vector circuits in Fig. 12\n shows that the overlapping domain's slip vector S\n13\u00a0=\u00a0S\n1\u2013 S\n2\u00a0+\u00a0S\n3. A useful way to think of this is that the overlapping domain is \u201cmissing\u201d the intermediate velocity domain. For overlap of another domain, a similar vector summation applies, with the intermediate \u201cmissing domain\u201d subtracted from the summation of the domains. For much of the parameter space for contractional structures, particularly curved faults, the velocity boundaries are steep, and thus velocity boundary interference is not present or is minimal (e. g. Fig. 5b). Nonetheless to properly account for the full velocity field, and conserve cross-sectional area, velocity boundaries must be checked for overlap and the full vector summation applied when needed.\nThe resulting structure from the discrete ramp-flat-ramp structure in Fig. 12 results in an anticline-over-syncline similar to that demonstrated by Medwedeff and Suppe (1997) and Novoa et al. (1997) using a similar fault shape for a geometric solution to kink-band interference during fault-bend folding. In order to maintain parallel behavior their solutions employed complex branching axial surfaces with multiple kink bands, and increased slip along slip surfaces joining kink bands. In our solution the beds that have resided below an overlapping velocity domain experience localized layer-parallel strain and a progressive change in dip between kink bands (Fig. 12). A flat-ramp-flat interaction, featuring a subtly curved fault, results in modest localized strain (Fig. 11). It is our view that for most natural thrust sheets modest localized strain (thickening and thinning of beds) and curved limbs are more representative of observed structural geometries than a proliferation of kink bands and rigid adherence to parallel behavior. Thus, we adopt this approach in our method; however, we acknowledge that there are other possible kinematic solutions to alleviate velocity boundary interference. If flexural slip is fully relaxed, one solution would be to change the orientation of the velocity boundaries so that they don't interfere by making the boundaries have a steeper slope (Townsend, 2011). The fundamental limitation with this approach is that imposing steeper velocity boundaries will result in layer-parallel elongation of the entire limb (e. g. Fig. 6a) rather than the localized strain that results from velocity-boundary interference. Another solution would be the generation of an out-of-the-syncline thrust to accommodate the space problem due to the interference. Each of these possible solutions are justified by observations from natural structures, and as such the implementation, and evaluation of their relative utility in different geological circumstances warrants further detailed investigation beyond the scope of this study.\n\n\n6.2\nFault imbrication\nThus far we have considered displacement over one fault during progressive slip, but imbrication requires consideration of additional factors. A straightforward approach to deformation associated with a second, break-forward fault in contraction or break-backward fault in extension would be to have deformation governed solely by the cutoff geometry on the second fault. In this scenario, the first fault acts as a passive boundary, and the previously deformed hanging wall orientations are sheared, much like the cases of growth strata and multiple bends discussed earlier. In the case of extensional fault-bend folding, this seems permissible since there is no governing bedding anisotropy (Fig. 13\n), and such a solution is equivalent to inclined-shear modeling of extensional structures with more than one fault. For contractional imbrication, however, this passive fault results in significant layer-parallel strain (Fig. 14\na). While there may be natural cases in which mechanical bedding anisotropy does not dominate in contractional structures, it is worth exploring the viability of modeling kinematically parallel behavior for imbricates (Fig. 14b). It was pointed out by Suppe (1983) that from a geometric standpoint, axial surfaces must refract across the first fault in order to conserve layer thickness, and that new \u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b3, and R must be determined to correctly characterize this geometry. This has been addressed by using the concept of folding vectors by Shaw et al. (1999) and also Shaw et al. (2005). They pointed out that folding of the previous fault during break-forward imbrication involves a change in length of the first fault, and thus some reactivation of slip on the first fault is necessary in order to conserve layer thickness.\nWe approach the solution of imbrication in contraction from a velocity standpoint in a similar vein to these authors. We solve for the reactivation of the hinterland fault during break-forward imbrication (Fig. 15\n) by computing the shear strain associated with the change (positive or negative) in length of the folded fault segment, |S\n12|, to its new length, |S\n22|, by considering the shear of S\n12 in the \u03b3 reference frame as S\n12\u03b3\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n\nS\n\n12\n\u03b3\n\n\n=\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n12\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n12\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n=\n\n[\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\nsin\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nu\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n12\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shear that S\n12\u03b3\n experiences to become S\n22\u03b3\n is\n\n(11)\n\n\nS\n\n22\n\u03b3\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\ntan\n\n\n2\n\u03b3\n-\n180\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n12\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n12\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nWith the additional reactivated slip, S\n22r, required on second fault equal to the difference in the magnitudes of the initial and final length of the fault segment\n\n(12)\n\n\n|\n\nS\n\n22\nr\n\n\n|\n\n=\n\n|\n\nS\n\n22\n\u03b3\n\n\n|\n\n\u2212\n\n|\n\nS\n\n12\n\u03b3\n\n\n|\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis additional slip, S\n22r, is the output slip after the bend, and thus the magnitude of input slip, |S\n21r\n|, is a function of the slip ratios for both faults\n\n(13)\n\n\n|\n\nS\n\n21\nr\n\n\n|\n\n=\n\n\n|\n\nS\n\n22\nr\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nR\n2\n\n\n\nR\n1\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nWith the imposed reactivated slip, S\n21r, on the new fault using Eq. (3) through (7), with the new fault geometry, \u03b8\n\n2\n and \u03c6\n\n2\n\n, over which the beds can move on this reactivated fault, this geometric change also provides for a new associated fold shape \u03b3\n\n2\n\n, and thus the orientation to the velocity boundary that separates the velocity domains changes (Fig. 15). We model all increased slip due to reactivation as coming from the hinterland because slip is already coming from that direction and thus can take advantage of existing thrust systems. Reactivation of slip along the older fault occurs as the underlying slip occurs. For the case of fault segments that get extended, the reactivation only is required up until the velocity boundary defining the reactivated bend. After that bend, beds above and below the older fault move together with the same slip vector (S\n12 in Fig. 15). For fault segments that are shortened due to refolding, reactivation requires sending slip from the bend into the foreland. For example, in the refolding of a front limb to flat (as in Boyer and Elliot (1982) style angular imbricates and duplexes) not calculating the reactivation would result in significant thickening of the refolded limb and would not refold the beds to flat (Fig. 16\na). In contrast, accounting for reactivation results in properly refolded and flattened layers to the previous front limb of the fault-bend fold, with no layer-parallel strain. Only modest additional folding occurs on the back limb as slip on the reactivated fault is sent into the foreland (Fig. 16b). The progressive model in Fig. 16c shows the kinematics associated with these iconic, if idealized, structures.\nAs with the single-fault models, discretization of slip and use of polylines can result in minor modeling artifacts, particularly for very angular fault models. This is particularly true because the second fault itself now must be discretized beyond its original few fault bends, as evidenced by the additional velocity boundaries emanating from refolded fault bends (Figs. 14, 16 and 17\n). These new bends themselves need to be translated by the kinematics associated with the underlying fault. The computation of layer-cutoffs on a fault can also result in artifacts, particularly because cutoff information can become ambiguous when moving through multiple bends; this occurs, for example, when velocity boundaries converge, such as in the final step of the progressive model of Fig. 16c. Nonetheless, using this reactivation approach, these kinematic numerical models of angular structures (Figs. 14 and 16) closely approximate parallel behavior and closely resemble geometric solutions of Suppe (1983), Shaw et al. (1999) and Shaw et al. (2005), with the added advantage that they can be implemented numerically and applied to quickly create cross sections using a modeling program such as fbfFor that would otherwise have required significant manual construction using the existing analytical framework.\nCurved-fault, imbricate models can also be generated that are area-balanced but include some layer-parallel strain (particularly without reactivation), resulting in smoothly varying limb dip (Fig. 17a). While these share some features with imbricates commonly seen in seismic data, both the strained back limb and the growth strata reveal the lack of reactivation of the refolded structure. Reactivation (Fig. 17b) in contrast results in development of continuous growth strata often observed in natural structures (e. g. Hughes and Shaw, 2014, their Fig. 13), and a less strained back limb. While attempting to obtain even more parallel folding might be more representative of real structures, the extent to which this can be achieved while moving through more than one bend during reactivation is limited from a computational perspective. Each reactivated bend requires a different additional slip amount to accommodate the change in fault length associated with refolding, and new velocity-boundary orientation. However, because slip associated with reactivation must pass from the hinterland of the section through each bend, such variable slip per bend cannot be achieved through any known solution we can imagine. The result of this is even apparent in the case of imbrication of angular faults by inspecting the pattern of strain in the structure (Fig. 14b); the additional slip required to refold the front limb must pass through all previous bends in the fault, resulting in modest LPS of the imbricate back limb due to this additional slip. For small fault bends the result is plausible (Fig. 17b), but cases can be created in which the additional strain far exceeds that which has been observed in natural structures. Thus, in our modeling program fbfFor we implement a heuristic that best accomplishes the dual objectives of optimizing slip reactivation to minimize layer-parallel strain while also ensuring conservation of cross-sectional area. In this approach, additional reactivated slip enters from the hinterland for the largest segment that changes slip (generally the largest fault bend), and slip on the other bends is calculated based on this value, resulting in modest local thickening and thinning. Because reactivation from one bend transfers this extra slip throughout other bends, area is not necessarily conserved. We employ an iterative solution that evaluates the area balance of the resultant model, and modifies the amount of reactivation until a solution is constructed that conserves cross-sectional area across the section.\nUse of this heuristic results in imbricate geometries more representative of those observed in natural systems; this is exemplified by, for example, the distinct differences in growth strata between the two models in Fig. 17, as discussed above. In these models, cross-sectional area is always conserved, but some localized layer-parallel strain occurs (Fig. 17b). While more complex routines could be developed, with creation of secondary faults, there is no getting around the fact that if the slip due to reactivation is coming from one direction, that slip must pass through any other bends encountered before the bend. Because of this, some new second-order folds and faults must develop or layer-parallel strain must occur. Such additional second-order strain is commonly observed in natural structures, and perhaps is a necessary condition of accommodating folding through multiple bends with internally consistent slip magnitudes. Detailed comparison of the location, spatial extent, and magnitude of strain in natural structures with that predicted by these various assumptions would be valuable to further evaluate these methodological assumptions and would be a fruitful topic for further analysis. Even with these caveats, however, we consider the approach employed here a demonstrable improvement over existing approaches. Models created with this approach minimize layer parallel strain, can be quickly and easily generated in order to test a range of models for application to specific natural structures, and most importantly, they look like natural, imbricate fault-bend folds.\n\n\n\n7\nApplications to seismic, analog, and mechanic examples\nWe have presented a numerical kinematic approach to forward modeling of fault-bend folds. We have explained the default parameters and the motivations for these, and shown how many of these parameters can be modified and still conserve cross-sectional area. Fig. 18\n provides a sampling of different forward models of fault-bend folds generated with the same algorithmic approach with more complexity than the simple models used to demonstrate particular concepts thus far. All are area balanced, and for contractional structures display mostly parallel pregrowth deformed strata, demonstrating the ability to create balanced models for complex structural scenarios. In this section we show the application of this kinematic approach to observed fault-bend folds in seismic data, as well analog and mechanic models. Our philosophy is to use the default parameters first to see how closely the models match the general theory, and then in some cases to modify parameters, particularly the velocity-boundary orientations, in order to attain a better match to the data. One of the primary advantages of analytical fault-bend folding methods that has enabled its extensive use is its predictive capability. Because this is diminished by relaxing strict adherence to the parallel fault-bend folding equations, we seek to minimize this deviation from theory.\n\n7.1\nSeismic example\nOur first example is a contractional fault-related fold well imaged in 2D, depth-converted, time-migrated, seismic-reflection data from the outer fold and thrust belt of the Niger Delta, offshore Nigeria (Shaw et al., 2005) shown uninterpreted in Fig. 1. This structure was chosen for its relative simplicity and the clarity with which the seismic reflection image constrains the fold and fault geometry. While we acknowledge that in most cases seismic data one wishes to model will be more ambiguous, demonstrating this method in such a well-constrained case demonstrates the validity of the approach presented here. In the deep-water Niger Delta, contractional deformation in the distal toe of a linked gravitational collapse system is accommodated by faulting and folding of deep water pelagic and turbiditic sediments with a regional lower detachment in the Akata Shale (Corredor et al., 2005; and others). This particular structure is characterized by a long, gently dipping back limb that dips less steeply than the thrust ramp. The front limb of the structure is narrower and slightly steeper, and truncation of reflectors in the front limb as a cutoff against flat layers in the footwall defines an upper flat detachment near the paleo-seafloor. Fanning of limb dips in the syntectonic section, limb-width asymmetry, and more shallowly dipping back limb than thrust ramp dip are characteristic of shear fault-bend folds (Suppe et al., 2004); observation of these characteristics for this structure were used to argue for interpretation of this structure as a shear fault-bend fold (Shaw et al., 2005). However, comparison with kinematic models using the methodology described in this paper demonstrates that these features can be at least equally well reproduced with a multi-bend, fault-bend folding solution.\nThe model shown in Fig. 19\na was constructed by manual adjustment of the height of horizontal sedimentary layers, the number of bends, amount of slip, and sedimentation rate relative to slip rate to match the geometry of reflectors in the seismic reflection image. This interpretation represents a kinematically permissible interpretation that provides an accurate match to the seismic reflection image. This model consists of 1950\u00a0m of slip on a rounded fault approximated by 6 synclinal and 5 anticlinal subtle bends, and variable syntectonic sedimentation rate. The seismic reflection image of the syntectonic section shows some reflectors that truncate and onlap the growing structure, while other layers are continuous across the crest of the structure. These variable growth geometries are accurately reproduced with this model through variation of the slip rate relative to the sedimentation rate, analogous to the dimensionless growth parameter, G, from Suppe et al. (1992). When slip rate is high relative to sedimentation rate, topography is developed at the crest of the structure, and subsequent sedimentation onlaps onto the topographic surface; conversely, when slip rate is low relative to sedimentation rate, sediments overtop the anticlinal crest, leading to the formation of continuous layers.\nAs velocity-boundary orientations are recalculated at each time step in the model based on cutoff geometries and the fault-bend equations as discussed earlier in this report, layer thickness is nearly fully maintained in the pregrowth; less than 4% layer-parallel shortening occurs in very limited regions of the forelimb (Fig. 19b). Up to 5% layer-parallel extension occurs throughout the front-limb growth strata due to the fact that velocity boundary orientations are governed by the pregrowth, and as they pass linearly up through growth layers of different dips, must necessarily result in modest strain, as discussed in the theoretical models of Fig. 5.\nOverall the model output matches the imaged structure quite well: the hanging wall, footwall, fault, and growth all generally match (Fig. 19a). This is the case even though the structure doesn't look like a conventional fault-bend fold (Fig. 19b). It has a long back limb, as well as a non-zero hanging wall cutoff in the lower part of the ramp despite the fact that it steps up from a detachment, and it has a rounded fold shape. Also, the growth strata do not show the classical growth triangles but rather show fanning of dip. These are all because of the gently curving ramp and movement through multiple velocity domains, as shown in earlier models presented in this report (e. g. Fig. 11).\nWhile we suspect most researchers would be quite pleased with this model fit, there are important, though subtle, deviations from the imaged structure, such as in the footwall below the ramp. We believe the over-pressured Akata Shale has caused a small velocity sag that was not fully removed in the depth conversion from the time migration. Other subtle misfits may be due to 2D acquisition and time processing. In addition, modeling assumptions or simplifications for this model, such as assumed horizontal deposition and no compaction, may not be fully valid. Likewise, default velocity boundary orientations governed by cutoff geometries were assumed, and perhaps a better fit could be obtained if these were imposed independently. In the next two examples, which are more constrained in many ways, we do explore variations in velocity boundaries. There may be more challenges than those listed above. This speaks to the need for an inversion approach that searches this complicated parameter space to explore and arrive at optimal models. While this is a goal of our ongoing research, we highlight here that the flexible forward modeling approach described herein is capable of generating an excellent fit to this interesting fault-bend fold even without application of such optimization methods.\n\n\n7.2\nAnalog model example\nIn an effort to explore the most appropriate method for modeling extensional fault-related fold kinematics, Dula (1991) created analog models using clay to observe the geometry of folding that results from displacement over non-planar normal faults. After evaluating the relative success of various kinematic descriptions, including slip line, inclined shear, constant displacement, constant heave, and constant bed length, Dula concluded that inclined shear with an angle of approximately 20\u00b0 from vertical proved the most successful description of the overall geometry and strain path. Through detailed balancing, Poblet and Bulnes (2005) noted that modeling the geometry as an extensional fault-bend fold with this fixed inclined shear angle of 70\u00b0 does not result in a fully accurate characterization of the analog model. Their quantitative analysis used both the geometry of the layers and the inscribed circles in the analog model which deformed into ellipses. Indeed, they concluded that no one inclined shear angle matches the structure particularly well. The deformation paths recorded in the initial analog modeling study (Dula, 1991, his Fig. 9b) exhibit a non-linear trajectory, which hints at the likelihood that a temporal variation in shear angle is appropriate.\nWe find that the fit to the analog model is improved by representing not only the two main synclinal bends, but additional observable subtle synclinal and anticlinal bends (Fig. 20\na); however, inclusion of this detail is still unable to provide an adequate fit. The best-fitting inclined shear angle determined by Dula, 70\u00b0 (Fig. 20a overlay), and our best-fitting single inclined shear orientation, 85\u00b0 (Fig. 20b), result in mismatches in the hanging wall at the fault and at the rollover hinge. However, a satisfactory fit to the analog model geometry can be attained; to achieve this, the velocity boundary orientations were iteratively varied over time and space until a satisfactory result was obtained. We found that the best-fitting model included four synclinal bends and two subtle anticlinal bends: the shallow synclinal bends (1 and 3) have a shear angle that varies linearly through the first quarter of the model run from 57\u00b0 to a constant value of 72\u00b0, the deep synclinal bends (5 and 6) vary over the same portion of the model run from 67\u00b0 to 85\u00b0, and the anticlinal bends (2 and 4) have a constant inclined shear angle of 85\u00b0 (final state of this model and the velocity boundaries is shown in Fig. 20c). The change in the velocity boundary orientation as displacement progresses is consistent with the non-linear trend in the particle trajectories that was observed in the original model by Dula, and suggests that temporal variations in the strength of the material due to accruing strain is a potentially important phenomenon that is necessary for accurately describing the evolution of such structures. The accuracy of this model is independently validated by the close agreement between the strain that accrued during deformation of the analog model and the predicted strain from the best-fitting kinematic model (Fig. 20d).\nThis temporally and spatially variable, inclined-shear, kinematic approach mostly answers the conundrum posed by Poblet and Bulnes (2005) of why no one inclined shear orientation fits the analog model well. Nonetheless, there are still small misfits between our best-fit kinematic model and the analog model. There are likely many reasons for this, including some practical limits to image reproduction, but also because it is possible that a small amount of the strain is not due to fault-bend folding. However, we are likely at the limit of the ability to analyze this model further, and we would argue that the final kinematic model is an excellent fit, and provides insight into the formation of this analog model. It also suggests a sobering reality for natural extensional rollover structures. We are not saying that all, natural structures necessarily behave in the same manner, but there is no reason to think that they may not also experience temporally and spatially variable inclined-shear.\n\n\n7.3\nNumerical mechanical model example\nWhile a comparison with analog models provides valuable insights into the growth of geologic structures, numerical mechanical modeling approaches have been widely applied to understanding the growth of geologic structures because they feature additional benefits, including the ability to more accurately represent rock properties and to monitor the evolution of stress and strain throughout the deformation process (Strayer et al., 2004; Hardy and Finch, 2007; Stockmal et al., 2007; Albertz and Lingrey, 2012; Albertz and Sanz, 2012; Dean et al., 2013; Hughes et al., 2014; Hughes and Shaw, 2015; and others). Though highly informative, like any modeling approach, they have limitations as well. These include assumptions that must be made regarding the strength and rheologic behavior of materials at the spatial and temporal scales of interest, and an inability to forward model specific natural structures without being highly prescriptive about the model geometry. However, it must be possible to describe the growth a structure both in terms of its rock properties (mechanically) and how its geometry evolves over time (kinematically); thus, a comparison of these two approaches holds the potential of harnessing the insights and capabilities inherent to each method. This will be explored in more detail in a forthcoming study, but we show an example of such a comparison here to highlight the utility of such an approach.\nNumerical mechanical modeling has proven useful in providing guidance into how kinematic expectations might deviate from what is observed in natural structures due to rock properties, and in how fault-related folds are likely to evolve outside of the analytical solution space for conventional kinematically modeled fault-related folds (Strayer et al., 2004; Hardy and Finch, 2007). Previous numerical mechanical modeling studies of fault-related folds have demonstrated that synclinal bends in shortening are in close accordance with analytical fault-bend folding expectations, but anticlinal bends depart more significantly from kinematic predictions (Benesh, 2010). Approximation of angular hinges in fault-bend folds as rounded has been identified as a useful representation of the effect that rock strength has on broadening the axial surface of folding from infinitesimally thin into a distributed axial zone (Suppe et al., 1997). This further provides one explanation for the observation of limb rotation indicators in growth strata deposited over fault-bend folds in some natural systems (e.g., Benesh et al., 2007). Furthermore, such mechanical models have been used to provide insight into the nature of structures that develop outside of the classical fault-bend folding parameter space, where layer thickness preservation is no longer possible (Hughes et al., 2014).\nWhile these previously mentioned mechanical-model studies highlight deviations from first-order kinematic expectations, it is possible to use the relaxed kinematic constraints described in this paper to characterize the growth of these structures, providing a useful way to describe the geometric evolution of such structures. An example of this is demonstrated in Fig. 21\n, a discrete element numerical mechanical model of a contractional anticlinal fault-bend fold. This model was generated by creating a synthetic rock mass of strong and weak layers out of discrete particles that interact with each other through interparticle friction, bond strength, and particle deformation; these micro-mechanical properties were calibrated to represent laboratory values for average rock strength, within a 15\u00a0km wide model bounded on the bottom by a thrust ramp and flat detachment. The model was then shortened through displacement of the left wall in 3\u00a0m increments at a strain rate of 3\u00a0m\/s then relaxed quasi-statically, until a total shortening of 1.5\u00a0km was accrued; during this process, the right model boundary wall displaces only as necessary to maintain constant stress along the model wall (more details about the model may be found in Hughes et al., 2014).\nIn this model case, the fault ramp-to-flat dip change of 40\u00b0 has no solution in the classical analytical fault-bend folding equations (Suppe, 1983) because it is impossible to preserve layer thickness across such a severe fault bend. Nonetheless, it is still a fault-bend fold: it is a fold that formed due to displacement over a non-planar fault. Just as with the mechanical model generated here, in nature one can easily imagine folding due to displacement on a ramp that is greater than 30\u00b0, and flattens at an upper detachment. The mechanical model provides insight into the geometry that might emerge under these conditions, given a realistic representation of rock properties. For this particular model set of properties and boundary conditions, the resulting fold geometry exhibits several properties that should be satisfied in any proper kinematic model, including rounded fold hinges, and systematic layer thinning in the fold limb and thickening in the syncline (Fig. 21a).\nWe approximate the fault bend as a series of more subtle bends, and the velocity boundaries that separate the fold domains are explicitly prescribed, to generate a satisfactory fit to the structural geometry (Fig. 21b and c). We impose the same slip on the ramp as the mechanical model and specify velocity boundaries, and compute the output slip using (7) as described earlier. The best-fitting fold solution shown here is the result of 4 bends, with velocity boundary dips of 90, 82, 75, and 66\u00b0, from left to right, that are fixed throughout the duration of shortening. By passing material through these fanning velocity boundaries over time, an accurate representation of the rounding of the fold hinge and progressive development of layer thickness changes is achieved (Fig. 21b). That the model accurately describes the growth history of the structure, and not just its final geometry, is demonstrated by the goodness of fit between the mechanical (yellow\/brown layers) and kinematic model geometries (green layers), which record the temporal progression of structural growth. A further check on the appropriateness of this model is that the known amount of shortening into, and slip out of the upper detachment in the mechanical model are well matched by the kinematic solution. The ability to represent rounded fold hinges and variability in layer thickness in fault-bend folds within a kinematic framework, previously the exclusive domain of mechanical models, provides great potential utility to structural geologists, as it allows for the more precise matching of natural structures that exhibit these features. Also provided is a tool for predicting the distribution of strain implied by such a structural deformation path (Fig. 21c). In this case, the LPS is heterogeneous with close to 30% extension in the steeper part of the front limb, and around 5% shortening adjacent to the syncline; such a prediction may prove useful in many applied settings in which a prediction of second-order strain is necessary.\nAs with the two other examples, there is very minor misfit, but we once again point out that no kinematic approach previously could model this steep ramp structure nearly as well, if at all. One could incorporate temporally varying velocity boundaries (such as was done with the analog extensional model) to potentially subtly improve the fit, model hillslope processes on the crest of the fold to better match the smooth topographic surface, or impose tectonic compaction, but such factors would only provide modest improvements and must necessarily be of minor significance, given the goodness of fit of the model shown here. Using a kinematic approach, we have in virtually every respect captured the geometry of the rounded, front limb, the progressive deformation as indicated by the growth strata, and the associated slip magnitudes. The kinematic model took seconds to run on a modern PC, and thus many potential models can be explored easily with this approach.\nThough one of the great values of conventional kinematic approaches is their unique and predictive angular relationships between features, which is diminished by relaxing the constraints in the manner described here, there are many examples such as that in Fig. 21 that are not adequately or even possibly modeled kinematically with previous approaches. A comparison with a broad range of mechanical models would serve to limit the range to the values that are most physically plausible, which will be fully explored in a forthcoming manuscript.\n\n\n\n8\nDiscussion\nThe velocity-based approach to fault-bend folding presented in this paper provides a flexible, easily utilized method for structural geologists to implement in their interpretations of complex natural structures. Improved accuracy of subsurface structural interpretations has the potential to reduce uncertainty in applications as diverse as petroleum exploration, seismic hazard assessment, and tectonics studies. Furthermore, the ability to extract essential components of their deformational history, such as strains, particle paths, and instantaneous velocity vectors, provided by this method, has immediate utility to research in thermochronology, landscape evolution, and progressive strain studies in tectonics, and reservoir modeling and subsurface fluid flow prediction in hydrologic and energy-systems applications.\nEven though this approach integrates significant variations, the velocity-based framework is such that further velocity-based descriptions of structural and stratigraphic processes could also be integrated into the framework. This would provide even greater ability to match observations in natural systems. Examples of potential further improvements include more complex stratigraphic processes such as erosion, compaction, and progradation, and further tracking of structural and stratigraphic parameters over the course of the modeled structural and stratigraphic evolution, such as burial history. Further additions of lateral subsidence variations due to flexure, and other far-field processes, unrelated to fault-bend folding would also improve direct applicability to natural systems. Specific structural modeling additions that build on the approach presented here and that could also be integrated into the modeling framework include trishear, structural wedges (triangle zones), and layer-specific layer thickening and thinning.\nWhile the flexible extensions to kinematic forward modeling algorithms of fault-bend folding presented here address some of the limitations to conventional balancing, these extensions present their own potential challenges in that the parameter space potentially greatly expands. For one, it might be difficult to truly determine the best parameters. If only the final deformed state is known, then multiple equivalent kinematic solutions could exist which would make the forward-modeling task potentially even more challenging. The basis for the range of parameters that are appropriate warrants more extensive future study including more detailed comparison with natural examples, and analog and numerical mechanical models of fault-related folds. Ultimately an inverse scheme that explores the parameter space to match structures observed in nature would be useful. The ability to reasonably limit the parameter space is a required precursor to any useful inversion modeling scheme using this approach. We envision this to be done in an objective way, informed by constraints from mechanical modeling, but guided by the knowledge of structural geologists, freeing them from some of the existing drudgery of rigorous section construction.\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nWe have presented a velocity-based, kinematic forward-modeling approach to fault-bend folding that ameliorates many of the limitations of existing approaches, enabling structural geologists to construct forward kinematic models of geologic circumstances that are substantially more varied and complex than was previously possible. When modeling contraction, the approach is capable of reproducing rounded-hinges and parallel folds with localized bed thinning or thickening commonly observed in natural structures. Temporally and spatially variable inclined-shear extensional models are likewise easily modeled. We have written a computer program, fbfFor, for constructing balanced sections that experience fault-bend folding based on the concepts presented here, and which was used to generate the models in this study. The program is free, and can be downloaded by contacting the first author.\n\n\nCRediT author statement\n\nConnors: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Data Curation, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing, Visualization, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.\n\nHughes: Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing, Visualization.\n\nBall: Software, Formal analysis, Writing - Review & Editing.\n\n","161":"","162":"","163":"","164":"","165":"","166":"","167":"","168":"","169":"","170":"","171":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe eastern Mediterranean ranks among the seismically most active regions within Europe. In the Adriatic Sea, seismicity associated with the convergence of the Adriatic microplate and Europe is particularly pronounced in the western Balkans, where several catastrophic events occurred (e.g. MW 7.1 Dubrovnik [1667], MW 6.6 Shkodra [1905], MW 6.1 Skopje [1963], MW 7.1 Bar [1979], MW 6.4 Durres [2019]). The Dubrovnik 1667 event (also known as \u201cRagusa earthquake\u201d), is the largest historically known earthquake in the Dinarides fold-and-thrust belt (Marku\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2017). It resulted in widespread destruction of the city of Dubrovnik (back then an independent city-state republic named \u201cRagusa\u201d) and has severely affected large segments of the Dalmatian coast, with dire economic and political consequences for the Republic of Ragusa (Marku\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2017). Inferences on the magnitude of this historical event relied on the assessment of macroseismic data, but evidently no further conclusions about its focal mechanism were possible. The strongest instrumentally recorded seismic event in the Dinarides, comparable to the Dubrovnik 1667 event in terms of its magnitude, occurred in the early morning of Easter Sunday on April 15th, 1979, in the coastal area of southern Montenegro near the city of Bar (Nedeljkovic et al., 1979). With a moment magnitude MW of 7.1 (Benetatos and Kiratzi, 2006) and intensities up to VIII (Papazachos et al., 2001; EMS-98 scale, Fig. 1\na) it ranks among the strongest instrumentally recorded earthquakes in Europe. It was the culminating event of a persistent series of foreshocks with magnitudes up to 5.3 within the region and caused more than 156 casualties, 1,400 injured and left more than 100,000 people homeless (Person, 1980). Despite the importance of this earthquake series in terms of its seismic moment release, there are only a handful of seismological studies about it (Boore et al., 1981; Console and Favali, 1981; Aliaj and Mu\u00e7o, 1983; Sulstarova, 1983; Baker et al., 1997; Trifunac and Ivanovi\u0107, 2003; Benetatos and Kiratzi, 2006). Early studies suggested that both main shock (April 15th, 1979; MW 7.1 Benetatos and Kiratzi, 2006) and its strongest aftershock (May 24th, 1979; MW 6.2 Benetatos and Kiratzi, 2006) were thrust fault events with hypocenters between c. 15 and 22\u00a0km depth. They ruptured shallowly NE-dipping faults striking parallel to the coastline (Boore et al., 1981; Console and Favali, 1981; Aliaj and Mu\u00e7o, 1983; Sulstarova, 1983), typical for most earthquakes delineating the front of the entire Dinarides fold-and-thrust belt (Anderson and Jackson, 1987; Kuk et al., 2000; Pondrelli et al., 2006; D'Agostino et al., 2008). The focal mechanism determinations of the earlier studies relied on first-motion polarities of p-waves (Boore et al., 1981; Console and Favali, 1981). Benetatos and Kiratzi (2006) carried out a full-waveform inversion, which yielded focal mechanisms that are very comparable to the previous studies, but with a shallower hypocentre depth of c. 7\u00a0km and an epicentre shifted towards the shore. There are far fewer studies focusing on the structural setting around the earthquake epicentre. This was largely since structures around the epicentre run offshore (Fig. 1), inhibiting direct access, and the lack of any reports of onshore surface ruptures (Nedeljkovic et al., 1979). In spite of the significant seismic hazard, former studies on the tectonic setting in the epicentral region of the 1979 Bar event rather focused on the hydrocarbon exploration potential (Bega, 2015) or only on single aspects like the foredeep geometries (Argnani et al., 2011; Del Bianco et al., 2014, 2015). Consequently, there are no reliable structural models relating the seismic moment release to any particular fault until now. In this study, 41 years after the earthquake, we intend to close this knowledge gap by combining available onshore geological information with well logs, 2D seismic lines, bathymetric data from new submarine soundings, published seismotectonic and seismological data as well as cross section balancing techniques into a new structural model for the 1979 epicentral area. Our results strongly suggest that the main shock (MW 7.1) and the strongest aftershock (MW 6.2) activated a hinterland-dipping thrust plane at the base of the so-called Dalmatian (Kruja) nappe system - a transregionally important tectonic unit that involves Cretaceous neritic carbonates, forming numerous thrust imbricates. We hold ongoing shortening on this basal thrust also responsible for the growth of elongated submarine ridges that form crests of fault-related anticlines. Furthermore, ongoing shortening results in the development of dry valleys in the frontal-most coastal anticlines, which show an active reorganisation of the drainage network in response to thrusting.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nOur study area is situated in the central Balkan Peninsula, in the border area between Albania and Montenegro and is facing the Adriatic Sea (Fig. 1). Studies in this area encounter the obstacle that the geoscientific communities of these countries have established their own nomenclature for tectonic units (see Schmid et al. (2020) for an encompassing overview). In this study, when referring to tectonic units, we adopt the names used in Montenegro, followed by their synonyms used in Albania in round brackets from this point onward. This approach is needed as several structures can be traced on either side of the political border.\nTectonically, the study area is located at the transition from the Dinarides into the Hellenides fold-and-thrust belts, which are separated by the orogen-perpendicular Shkodra-Peja Fault in northern Albania (e.g. Handy et al., 2019). Across this fault, the orogenic strike changes from NW-SE in the Dinarides to NNW-SSE in the Hellenides, caused by a clockwise rotation of the Southern Balkan Peninsula around a rotation pivot near Shkodra (Jouanne et al., 2012; M\u00e9tois et al., 2015), which is triggered by slab rollback in the Hellenic subduction zone further south (Burchfiel et al., 2008; Jolivet et al., 2013; Handy et al., 2019). The present deformation front of the Dinarides and Hellenides fold-and-thrust belt is largely concealed under the Adriatic Sea or by deposits of the Peri-Adriatic depression in northern and central Albania. Contractional earthquake focal mechanisms delineate the deformation front, indicating a SW-NE oriented maximum horizontal stress. This contraction is caused by ongoing NE-directed continental subduction of Adria below Eurasia, as supported by teleseismic tomography (Pironallo and Morelli, 2003; Hall and Spakman, 2015 in Handy et al., 2019) and plate-tectonic reconstructions (Le Breton et al., 2017). GPS studies suggest 2\u20134 mm\/a convergence, mostly taken up along the deformation front (Alt\u0131ner et al., 2006; D'Agostino et al., 2008; Caporali et al., 2009; Jouanne et al., 2012; Serpelloni et al., 2013; Faccenna et al., 2014; M\u00e9tois et al., 2015). Plate convergence is associated with SW-directed thrusting of Adria derived thrust sheets (Tari Kova\u010di\u0107 and Mrinjek, 1994; van Unen et al., 2018). Traditionally, the tectonic units in both Dinarides and Hellenides are divided into internal and external zones (Tomljenovi\u0107 et al., 2008; Schmid et al., 2020). While the internal units are typically characterised by ophiolite-bearing composite nappes (Schmid et al., 2020), the external units are dominated by widespread Mesozoic carbonate platforms and intermittent hemipelagic to pelagic basins (Argnani, 2013). In this study, we focus on the external units of this collisional fold-and-thrust belt, where most active contraction is accommodated (Bennett et al., 2008; Kastelic and Carafa, 2012). Due to lateral changes in basin shape and thrust tectonics, the units are subject to variations in thickness, exposure and existence. The overall structure of these units is characterized by a SW-directed nappe stack, involving subordinate thrusting and folding within the individual units, that led to variable degrees of internal deformation. While the uppermost unit considered here, the High Karst (Albanian Alps) Unit, is represented by a single nappe uniformly dipping to the NE, the underlying Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit is hardly existent in Montenegro. It appears only as a narrow band along the foot of the Rumija mountain chain and pinches out NW of Kotor Bay (Fig. 1b). To the south, the Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit progressively widens in map view. The underlying Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit forms the most external onshore tectonic unit in Montenegro, comprising the prominent coastal anticlines between the Rumija mountain chain and the coastline. Hereafter, a detailed description of the tectonic units pertinent to our study follows (see also Fig. 2\n & supplementary figure SF 1).\n\n2.1\nHigh-Karst (Albanian Alps) Unit\nThe High-Karst (Albanian Alps) Unit comprises Late Permian to Early Triassic terrigenous formations followed by Middle Triassic to Cretaceous neritic carbonates and Palaeocene to Early Eocene variegated carbonates and siliciclastics (Fig. 2). It overthrusted the Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit towards the SW and S, while having been overthrust itself by the Pre-Karst Unit. In the border area between Montenegro and Albania, the High-Karst (Albanian Alps) Unit reveals a large-scale monocline with a half wavelength around 70\u00a0km and a crest in the Cukali half-window, implying that the basal thrust of the High-Karst (Albanian Alps) Unit predates shortening in the more external Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit. In the study area, the High-Karst (Albanian Alps) Unit forms a topographically pronounced ridge (Rumija mountain chain) between Bar and Lake Shkodra which is built up by NE-dipping strata.\n\n\n2.2\nBudva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit\nThe Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit sits tectonically below the High-Karst (Albanian Alps) Unit, being separated by a SW-vergent thrust. Its stratigraphic succession starts with a Early to Middle Triassic neritic to hemipelagic series which is covered by a Ladinian pelagic volcano-sedimentary sequence (Gori\u010dan, 1994). Pelagic limestones, radiolarites and resedimented carbonates continue further upsection until siliciclastic turbiditic intervals with minimum ages of Late Palaeocene set in (Gori\u010dan, 1994; Me\u00e7o and Aliaj, 2000), providing a maximum age for the tectonic emplacement of the High-Karst (Albanian Alps) Unit on top of the Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit.\n\n\n2.3\nDalmatian (Kruja) Unit\nThe Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit lies tectonically underneath the Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit. The stratigraphic succession commences with evaporites of late Early Cretaceous to early Late Cretaceous age, followed upsection by Late Cretaceous neritic carbonates. The Palaeocene is represented by bauxite deposits, documenting the emergence of carbonate platforms before renewed subsidence deposited Middle Eocene nummulitic limestones. These are followed by Late Eocene to Early Oligocene synorogenic turbiditic siliciclastics. Cretaceous evaporites are only known from subsurface exploration in southern Montenegro (\u010canovi\u0107 and D\u017eod\u017eo-Tomi\u0107, 1958; \u010canovi\u0107, 1965, 1969) and form the basal detachment of this unit. In central and southern Albania, the Kruja Unit forms a NNW-SSE striking belt (Fig. 1b). N of Lezha, the strike changes into WNW-ESE (Biermanns et al., 2019), continuing into our study area. The border area between northern Albania and Montenegro is overlain by Quaternary sediments, forming extensive alluvial plains between Shkodra and the coast. Southwards into central Albania, this thrust unit shows very prominent exposures of several thrust imbricates around the city of Kruja, providing ample evidence of stacking into several W-directed thrust imbricates (Roure et al., 2004; Velaj, 2012). These imbricates are unconformably overlain by Serravallian-Tortonian strata. In combination, this implies that the shortening within the Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit was largely accomplished after the Early Oligocene and before the Middle Miocene.\n\n\n2.4\nIonian Unit\nThe Ionian Unit tectonically underlies the Albanian Kruja Unit and pinches out northward into offshore Montenegro (Fig. 1b). It consists of Permo-Triassic evaporites, Late Triassic to Early Jurassic neritic platform carbonates, giving way to Cretaceous to Eocene pelagic carbonates and Oligocene synorogenic turbiditic deposits. Both, the width of this unit and amount of shortening therein increases towards southern Albania. Its pinch-out towards N can most likely be attributed to the disappearance of Permo-Triassic evaporites acting as a d\u00e9collement layer in Albania.\n\n\n\n3\nSeismicity\n\n3.1\nRegional seismicity\nThe coastal area of the eastern Adriatic region is well known for increased seismic moment release, having repeatedly hosted medium to strong earthquakes, of which some were even tsunamigenic (e.g. 1667 Mw 7.1 Dubrovnik & 1979 Mw 7.1 Bar (Kastelic et al., 2013)). N of Split (southern Croatia) the seismic moment release diminishes abruptly (Ustaszewski et al., 2014). Therefore, seismicity mostly concentrates on the Hellenic segment, where focal mechanisms indicate a SW-NE directed maximum horizontal stress axis along the deformation front (Anderson and Jackson, 1987; Mu\u00e7o, 1994; Vannucci et al., 2004; Pondrelli et al., 2006; D'Agostino et al., 2008; Marku\u0161i\u0107, 2008). This is consistent with GPS-derived motion vectors (e.g. Jouanne et al., 2012; M\u00e9tois et al., 2015) and structural data. The contractional Ionian-Adriatic earthquake belt is c. 80\u00a0km wide and appears as a coast-parallel band of shallow to intermediate depth crustal seismicity. Hinterland seismicity in central and eastern Albania is related to upper-plate extension (Burchfiel et al., 2008; Handy et al., 2019) and slightly weaker than seismicity in the coastal areas. In terms of magnitude, stronger seismicity is recorded in the frontal, contractional thrust belt segment (Fig. 3\n). Evaluation of the ISC earthquake catalogue clearly shows a strong clustering of seismic events, largely outlining the coastline or topographic features (Figs. 1 & 3).\nA kernel density analysis of the seismic moment reveals highest release among the coastal contractional belt (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a takes all seismic events between 1962 and 2016 into account, except the 1979 main shock (MW 7.1) and strongest aftershock (MW 6.2) to enhance visibility of other events. Therefore, a few stronger earthquakes in the region of the May 24th strongest aftershock (compare Fig. 4a\n & b), stick out (Fig. 3a) even though the main seismic moment release took place further to the SE. The seismic moment release density map shown in Fig. 3b considers only earthquakes with a moment magnitude 2 \u2264 MW\u00a0\u2264\u00a06. It therefore shows a representative distribution of the background seismicity, less influenced by single, stronger events. There is a remarkably good correlation of the seismically active regions with structures that were active since the Neogene (Fig. 3b). The coast-parallel contractional belt with its most recent event (MW 6.4 near Durres, 26.11.2019), as well as the Vlora-Elbasan Transversal Zone can also easily be discerned. The isolated but prominent cluster in northernmost Albania reflects induced seismicity during gradual filling of a large hydroelectric reservoir dam in the late 1970-ies to early 1980-ies (Mu\u00e7o, 1991). Furthermore, in both maps, along the contractional coastal belt, a clear seismic gap between Kotor Bay and Dubrovnik as well as around the city of Vlora with very few events and a low seismic moment release is discernible (Fig. 3).\n\n\n3.2\nThe 1979 MW 7.1 sequence\nThe Mw 7.1 event on April 15th, 1979 had its epicentre half-way between the cities of Bar and Ulcinj near the village of Dobra Voda (Herak et al., 1996; Kuk et al., 2000; Vannucci et al., 2004; Pondrelli et al., 2006; D'Agostino et al., 2008; Gr\u00fcnthal and Wahlstr\u00f6m, 2012). Due to a rather sparse seismic station network at that time, the localisation of the hypocentre has strong uncertainties of up to 50\u00a0km, depending on the catalogue. We consider event localisation and fault plane solution of Benetatos and Kiratzi (2006) most reliable, because it relies on waveform inversion of body waves. It shows a shallowly dipping thrust plane of 030\/14 (dip direction\/dip angle) and a hypocentre at a depth of c. 7\u00a0km (see Fig. 4c). The low dip angle implies that the fault ruptured along a deeper section, likely at a flat position. The strongest aftershock on May 24th, (Mw 6.2, Benetatos and Kiratzi, 2006) located ~45\u00a0km further to the NW of the mainshock and largely along strike. It also shows thrust geometries with 050\/35 and a slightly shallower hypocentre at c. 6\u00a0km depth (see Fig. 4d, localised by body wave waveform inversion by Baker et al., 1997). Mainshock and strongest aftershock during the 1979 sequence as well as their respective aftershocks form two spatially distinct clusters between the cities of Bar and Budva, separated by a c. 15\u00a0km wide gap (Karakaisis et al., 1985; Trifunac and Ivanovi\u0107, 2003; Benetatos and Kiratzi, 2006) (Fig. 4a). This bimodal distribution suggests that co-seismic rupturing affected two separate fault patches. Interestingly, the modelled co-seismic slip contours indicate displacement largely NW of the main shock epicentre within the area of this seismic gap, with a maximum slip of 2.7\u00a0m (isolines in Fig. 4c, adopted from Benetatos and Kiratzi (2006)). Conceivably, a substantial stress drop during the main shock inhibited further seismicity along this fault patch. The modelled co-seismic slip contours for the strongest aftershock indicate a movement of up to 30\u00a0cm (Fig. 4d). We notice that the modelled slip contours also coincide with the position of elongated, submarine ridges, which were described during a chirp sonar study focusing on the stratigraphic architecture of the continental margin in that area (Del Bianco et al., 2014). Until now, no connection between these structures and any faults in the area has ever been made, let alone a connection to the earthquake of 1979.\n\n\n\n4\nBathymetric analysis\nThe bathymetry of the Adriatic Sea in the study area is characterized by a shallow eastern part with depths around 300\u2013400\u00a0m before dropping to a maximum depth of around 1200\u00a0m in the Southern Adriatic Basin (SAB), which forms the connection into the Ionian Sea (Fig. 1a). The slope of the sea floor ranges from <1\u00b0 in the coastal waters up to 20\u00b0 at the rim of the SAB, (EMODnet Bathymetry Consortium, 2018). Offshore of the Montenegrin coast, the sea bottom is covered by Neogene and Quaternary sediments, dipping to WSW (Del Bianco et al., 2015). Available bathymetric data (EMODnet Bathymetry Consortium, 2018) and new high-resolution submarine soundings of the Meteor M86\/3 cruise (Kopp et al., 2013) show three elongated, yet unconnected submarine ridges located c. 15\u00a0km off the coast between the cities of Bar and Budva. The long axes of these ridges strike NW-SE, strictly parallel to the strike of onshore structures, the strike of the nodal planes of the 1979 main shock fault plane solution and its coseismic slip pattern (Fig. 4c and d). The most prominent ridge (\u201cBar Ridge\u201d) was covered by the Meteor M86\/3 cruise sounding, as well as by a high-resolution stratigraphic survey of Del Bianco et al. (2015). It measures 4.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.5\u00a0km and has a rather flat top that raises c. 20 m above the surrounding sea floor, which is around 70\u00a0m below sea level (b.s.l., Figs. 5 & 6\nb).\nAdjacent ripple structures along the sea floor were interpreted as palaeodunes (Del Bianco et al., 2014), probably witnessing the glacio-eustatic lowstand of the Adriatic Sea during the last glacial maximum at around 130\u00a0m below present-day datum at around 19 ka BP (Clark et al., 2009). Therefore, its flat top is most likely an erosional feature. The flanks of the ridge show a notable asymmetry of the slopes: the NE flank is gently dipping towards the coast, while the SW flank is much steeper (Fig. 5). The two smaller, less prominent along-strike structures show the same bathymetric asymmetry. Additionally, high resolution echo sounding has revealed a SW-vergent anticlinal structure with a steeper SW limb and a gently dipping NE limb (Del Bianco et al., 2014). Furthermore, discordantly onlapping sediments provide strong evidence that these structures evolved syntectonically over time. High sedimentation rates led to a burial of the structure in some parts. Reflection seismic data reveal that the ridges form crests of nascent and actively growing fault-related anticlines (Fig. 6c).\n\n\n5\nReflection seismic and well data\n\n5.1\nAvailable data\nSeveral hydrocarbon exploration campaigns conducted largely during the late 1990-ies yielded a comprehensive pool of reflection seismic data across the Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit. For this study, a dataset including about 60 offshore 2D reflection seismic lines gathered during a variety of campaigns, and 10 borehole wells (6 onshore & 4 offshore, see Figs. 6a & 7\n) was revised to complement onshore data gathered from available geological maps and field observations.\nThe seismic lines are evenly distributed, covering an area of 60\u00a0km along-strike (NW-SE) x 45\u00a0km across-strike (NE-SW) with a minimum distance of 1\u00a0km to the Montenegrin shoreline and an average distance of 2\u20134\u00a0km in between single lines. The length of the sections ranges from 10 to 55\u00a0km. In order to ensure the necessary confidentiality required by E & P business, the seismic data is mainly displayed in perspective view and with altered display (see Fig. 8\n for a perspective view of parts of the dataset). Most figures display the \u201coutcrop\u201d attribute (Schlumberger Petrel, 2017) instead of the amplitude. This enhances main features in the seismic profiles, which is especially useful in overview figures. Exploration wells are unevenly distributed, clustering around the area of Bar and Ulcinj. Drilled depths range from 886\u00a0m to 5,308\u00a0m and penetrated predominantly Cretaceous strata in the onshore wells and Palaeogene to Quaternary strata in the offshore wells (Figs. 7 & SF2). Most of the wells pierced at least one thrust contact, recognised by the repetition of marker layers, providing information about the depth location of the thrusts. Across the wells, the succession of penetrated lithologies is highly dissimilar, implying the existence of numerous thrust imbricates. Besides a gross lithological description, seismic to well modelling has been performed in 4 wells, allowing detailed assessment of formation average velocities (Fig. 7 & Supplementary Table ST 1). A precise seismic to well tie was not possible for the whole area due to the large distance between most wells and the targeted structures. Furthermore, the quality of several seismic profiles is often low due to coastal sideswipes - especially where most of the wells are located. Owing to the consistence of lithologies, a correlation of seismic velocities was also possible for wells without velocity information. This enabled us to perform a depth conversion for some of the interpreted sections. Cross-correlating reflectors between numerous intersecting profiles allowed to inter- and extrapolate reflectors across data gaps and into areas with poor data quality. The congruence of the picked reflectors at their intersections is around \u00b110\u00a0ms TWT, equivalent to c. 25 m depth assuming an average seismic velocity of 5,000\u00a0m\/s. Those inaccuracies can be attributed to differences in the processing of along-strike and across-strike sections for steeply dipping reflectors (e.g. during migration). We considered them negligible, since distinctive features of the picked sequence were still recognizable.\n\n\n5.2\nData analysis\nA selection of 40 seismic sections and 8 boreholes was chosen for more detailed analysis and with the aim of a structural interpretation, linking offshore and onshore data. Due to the lack of wells with sufficient depth, location and quality, several prominent reflectors were chosen that presumably delimit top and\/or base of main sedimentary successions. A tentative identification of sedimentary units was based on the gross seismic characteristics of the units, such as seismic facies (after Mitchum et al., 1977), unconformities and onlap relationships. Knowledge about sedimentary successions in the study area from geological maps and well data suggest that the selected lithostratigraphic units correspond relatively well to chronostratigraphic units. Therefore, strong reflectors can be expected for the transition between Pliocene to Quaternary siliciclastics and underlying Messinian carbonates, as well as for the unconformable top of Late Cretaceous limestone delimiting Eocene-Oligocene carbonates and siliciclastics. The existence of Messinian evaporites on the other hand is neither reported in any of the well logs nor discernible in the seismic sections in the study area. Few reflectors were expected within the Cretaceous succession due to consistent lithologies and densities. The Eocene-Oligocene succession with alterations of variegated shales, argillaceous sandstones and carbonates contains strong reflectors due to strongly differing densities and seismic velocities. Based on all considerations made above, the mapped reflectors were assigned to the top of the Miocene, Oligocene and Cretaceous successions.\nFaults were interpreted following standard structural concepts (Shaw, 2005). In the selected sections, faults can be recognised in their flat-positions as weak reflectors, where they create a density contrast within otherwise homogenous rocks (like in the Cretaceous limestones) and in steeper ramp sections where they offset strong reflectors.\n\n\n5.3\nStructural interpretation\nBased on our seismic and well interpretation, several previously unreported tectonic features were recognised in the study area. Our findings show that the previously described submarine elongated ridges (Chapter 4) are connected to a triangle structure with two NE-vergent back-thrusts, cross-cut by a later stage SE-vergent thrust fault (Figs. 8 &\nSF 2).\n\n5.3.1\nTriangle structure\nThe triangle structure consists of an intra-Cretaceous wedge up to 17\u00a0km long in cross-section (Figs. 8, 9 &\n\nSF 2). This is evidenced in a distinct upward-bulging of the corresponding reflectors (to the right\/north of the pink arrows in Fig. 8). The amount of displacement is largest in the central part of the ridges and diminishes towards NW and SE. In map view, this leads to a south-westward convex line, marking the leading edge of the triangle structure and representing the outermost deformation front (pink line in Fig. 9a).\n\n\n5.3.2\nBack-thrusts\nThe roof thrust of the triangle structure is associated with two back-thrusts (turquoise and green arrows and lines in Figs. 8 & 9a). Back-Thrust 1 (turquoise) represents the direct continuation of the roof thrust of the triangle structure. Back-Thrust 2 (green) only exists in the area of the Bar Ridge and its along-strike continuation to the SE. Around the south-eastern edge of the Bar Ridge, the offset along Back-Trust 1 diminishes abruptly, while the amount of shortening accommodated within the triangle structure diminishes gradually to the SE. Therefore, the subordinate Back-Thrust 2 represents a transition from a substantial amount of back-thrusting to no back-thrusting (compare Fig. SF 3). Back-Thrust 1 shows larger offsets of the top Cretaceous reflector than Back-Thrust 2. Nevertheless, neither of the two back-thrusts offsets reflectors younger than Paleocene. Eocene to Oligocene deposits show pronounced thickness variations across the crests of the Kotor and Bar ridges. This indicates that this succession represents an interval of syntectonic sedimentation. The Miocene succession also shows thickness variations across the ridge crests, but to a lesser extent. Combined, these observations suggest an Eo-Oligocene to Miocene age of tectonic activity along the triangle structure and its associated back-thrusts.\n\n\n5.3.3\nDalmatian basal thrust fault\nThe NE-vergent back-thrusts rooting in the frontal triangle zone have been offset by a SW-vergent thrust at a later stage (Figs. 6c, 8, 12, SF 2 & SF 3). This thrust connects the Kotor and Bar ridges (Chapter 4) on its leading edge with several structurally higher thrust imbricates on its trailing end. In our dataset, this thrust, and the thrust imbricates on its trailing end could be mapped for c. 48\u00a0km along strike. Towards SE, close to the coast around Bar, the offshore thrust imbricates connect with four fault-related anticlines exposed in the Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit onshore (labelled \u201c1\u201d to \u201c4\u201d in Figs. 8 & 9). We therefore interpret this thrust cross-cutting the back-thrusts in the Kotor and Bar ridges to represent the basal thrust of the Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit, which connects along-strike with the thrust belt front as previously mapped (Fig. 9a).\n\n\n\n\n6\nKinematic modelling of cross sections\nTo gain a better understanding of the kinematics and possible onshore connections of the identified structures, kinematic modelling was applied to two cross-sections: a first section through the epicentral region of the 1979 MW 7.1 main shock (Section A-A\u2032) and a second section through the bathymetric Bar Ridge (Section B\u2013B\u2019, see Fig. 9 for section traces).\n\n6.1\nCross section A (kinematic forward model through the epicentral area)\nWe constructed a balanced cross-section through the epicentral area of the 1979 mainshock, combining onshore geological and structural data as well as offshore lithological well logs (Figs. 9b, 10 & 11\n\n\n). Seismic profiles turned out to be poor in this area (probably due to sideswiping from the coast) and were therefore hardly considered as useful information. All available data within a 5\u00a0km distance to each side were projected orthogonally to the section (see Fig. 9b). The central part of Section A is characterised by 4 anticlines exposed onshore between the shoreline and the thrust front of the Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit. These anticlines consist of Cretaceous neritic carbonates and Eocene to Early Oligocene strata. Analysis of onshore geometries and well data led to the conclusion that these four anticlines are part of a larger antiformal stack of 6 thrust imbricates, numbered 1 to 6 from top to bottom (Figs. 9\u201311). A syntectonic deposition of the Cenozoic sediments is indicated by discernible thickness variations: according strata in the hinterland are very thin to non-existent compared to an increasing thickness between individual thrust imbricates in foreland positions. Further evidence for syntectonic deposition is the lower thickness of Cenozoic sediments in anticlinal crest positions described in Me\u00e7o and Aliaj (2000). The considerably differing dip angle and thickness of the individual thrust imbricates indicate a multiply stepped basal thrust. Based on this fault geometry, geological and structural outcrop data and well data we validated a kinematic forward model using the fault-bend-folding algorithm within the Petex MOVE 2019.1 structural modelling software.\nBy modelling a stepwise foreland propagation of the stepped detachment with flats at three different depth levels and adding syntectonic sediments with a thickness of 90\u00a0m after each deformation step (Fig. 10), all structural and stratigraphic observations could be satisfactorily explained (Figs. 11 &\nSF 4). The youngest sediments that experienced shortening during the emergence of the first anticline within the Kruja (Dalmatian) Unit give an upper age limit for the onset of deformation in the Early Oligocene (Fig. 10a). Serravallian-Tortonian lithothamnia limestone discordantly overlies anticline number 4 around the city of Ulcinj. The subsequent westward tilting of this unconformity is probably related with the emergence of anticline number 5 (Fig. 10e & f). The deformation of Pliocene strata by anticline number 6 is documented by reflection seismic data (Figs. 6c & 10g) and gives a minimum estimate for the duration of folding. The total shortening within the Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit amounts to 47%. In analogy with evidence from northern Albania (Roure et al., 2004; Velaj, 2012) we suspect that the shortening in stages A-D of Fig. 10 is of Rupelian to pre-Serravallian age. Consequently, the shortening depicted in stages E-G of Fig. 10 is most likely of post-Serravallian to recent age. Using the above time brackets and modelled shortening amounts, we estimate average shortening rates of 1.18 mm\/a for stages A-D and 0.78 mm\/a for stages E-G. Ongoing shortening is strongly suggested by the presence of seismic events on the along-strike continuation of the Infra-Dalmatian thrust, suggesting an embryonic foreland propagation of the basal detachment (compare Fig. 8). Interestingly, our above estimates of shortening rates relying on the geological record compare well with those estimated by Kastelic and Karafa (2012) in the area based on GPS data.\n\n\n6.2\nCross section B (kinematic restoration of the bathymetric ridges)\nWhile the balanced Cross Section A provides a geometrically viable model explaining seismicity observed during the 1979 series, a more detailed section was required to determine the structural connection between the epicentral area with the area that accommodated the highest co-seismic slip (Kotor and Bar ridges). Well data is rare in the area around the bathymetric ridges, but reflection seismic data is of high quality in this region. Depth-converted seismic sections running through the central part of the Bar ridge allowed the restoration of the eroded hinge zone and a stepwise restoration of the structure (Fig. 12). For this purpose, the fault-bend-folding algorithm within the Petex MOVE 2019.1 software was used.\nOur restoration reveals that a post-Miocene shortening of c. 2,320\u00a0m among the frontal-most thrust imbricate is necessary to create the present-day geometry. Taking this as age- and shortening constraints, the average shortening rate on this fault amounts to 0.4 mm\/a.\n\n\n\n7\nOnshore-offshore correlation of identified structures\n\n7.1\nConnection of offshore thrust imbricates with onshore coastal anticlines of the Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit\nThe presented sections allow a correlation of structural features along strike. Key feature is the Dalmatian basal thrust, which was demonstrably active during the 1979 earthquake series. We compiled a contour map for this thrust fault by using depth information obtained from the balanced cross sections, depth converted seismic sections, hypocentre locations and well data (Fig. 13\n).\nIn the area of Section B, the Dalmatian basal thrust shows a pronounced flat-segment in a depth of 4\u20135\u00a0km b.s.l., which is not present in Section A. The length of this flat-segment decreases from NW to SE and is replaced by a uniformly, more steeply NE-dipping fault segment. In the same region, also the shortening accommodated along the deeper, Infra-Dalmatian thrust decreases. While shortening along this thrust was responsible for the formation of the triangle structure along Section B, along Section A it is only recognizable as an embryonic, but likely seismogenic feature. The structurally higher stack of thrust imbricates above the Dalmatian basal thrust on the other hand is more pronounced along Section A. There, they appear onshore as four NW-SE-striking coast-parallel brachy-anticlines that plunge SE-ward below Quaternary sediments around the Montenegrin-Albanian border (labelled \u201c1\u201d to \u201c4\u201d in Figs. 8 & 9). The two structurally topmost of these fault-related anticlines re-emerge in northern Albania with a NNW-SSE-strike (\u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d in Fig. 9), while the two structurally deeper imbricates (\u201c3\u201d and \u201c4\u201d in Fig. 9) remain subsurface (Roure et al., 2004; their Fig. 6; see also Velaj, 2012). Further S, shortening also involved the structurally underlying Ionian Unit, which is not exposed in our study area.\n\n\n7.2\nDry valleys in coastal anticlines as indicator for ongoing surface uplift\nThe structurally highest anticlines within the Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit in southern Montenegro and northern Albania (numbered \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d above) exhibit several dry valleys at different altitudes (Biermanns et al., 2019). Most prominent is the dry valley across anticline \u201c2\u201d S of Dobra Voda, which also features a flat eroded crest (Fig. 14\n). Both, this erosional top and the abandoned river course in the dry valley are horizontal, suggesting no sustained folding after their formation. This raises the question as to whether river incision post-dates or pre-dates the formation of the wave-cut platform (Model A vs. Model B in Fig. 14).\nThe existence of river pebbles (including well rounded radiolarites sourced from the Budva (Krasta-Cukali) Unit) and the lack of marine sediments in the dry valley rather supports Model A. Nevertheless, both models suggest that active deformation must have occurred along a deeper thrust to generate surface uplift without active fold growth of the coastal anticlines. This conclusion matches with the observations of increased seismic activity along the structurally underlying Dalmatian basal thrust, as well as along the Infra-Dalmatian thrust (compare Fig. 11). In summary, we mostly consider the NE-dipping Dalmatian basal thrust to have triggered surface uplift and concomitant river incision that gave rise to the dry valleys observed.\n\n\n\n8\nDiscussion\nThe investigation of seismic sections in our study area revealed gradual along-strike changes of horizontal shortening within the Dalmatian (Kruja) Unit. We suspect that these along-strike changes are responsible for the irregular coastline cutting across the structural grain (Figs. 8 & 9). In the area of Section B (Figs. 9b & 12), the largest amount of shortening was accommodated in the frontal-most thrust imbricates along the Dalmatian basal thrust, which gave rise to the bathymetric ridges. Estimating the shortening accommodated along the structurally underlying triangle structure (Infra-Dalmatian thrust) turned out to be complex: Reflectors younger than Paleogene are not offset by the roof thrust (Back-Thrust 1 & 2), but are tilted towards SW above the leading edge of the triangle structure. This cannot be explained by movement along the Dalmatian basal thrust. A possible explanation is a \u2018fishtail-structure\u2019: shortening is accommodated by stacked wedges within a triangle structure. Small scale, alternating fore- and back-thrusts in the core of the triangle structure would allow ongoing shortening without offsetting overlying reflectors. The assumption of an alternating or even simultaneous activation of triangle structure (Infra-Dalmatian thrust) and Dalmatian basal thrust is supported by clearly detectable seismicity along the Infra-Dalmatian thrust (Fig. 11). Along strike, in Section A (Figs. 9 & 11), a larger amount of shortening was accommodated in structurally higher thrust imbricates, which also led to the emersion of four coastal anticlines. The existence of several windgaps in the two structurally highest anticlines implies a Plio-Quaternary to ongoing surface uplift of the coastal region. The flat, erosional top and the abandoned river valley of the coastal anticline S of Dobra Voda (Fig. 14) suggests uniform surface uplift rather than sustained folding. Surface uplift was triggered by ongoing, seismogenic faulting along the underlying hinterland-dipping Dalmatian basal thrust that carries several structurally higher piggyback anticlines. We suspect that all described structures can be linked to this basal thrust, which was also active during the 1979 earthquake series. According to empirical correlations of Wells and Coppersmith (1994), a MW 7.1 thrust fault earthquake like in 1979 corresponds to a surface rupture length of c. 52.6\u00a0km and a subsurface rupture length of c. 56.5\u00a0km (Fig. SF 5). These results are comparable to the mapped length of the activated frontal-most thrust sheet of c. 48\u00a0km (Fig. 9, section of the active thrust front which is framed by the pink line). An estimation of the downdip rupture width can only be obtained from the modelled Section A, as the localisation of aftershock hypocentres is considered too inaccurate. The accordingly interpolated width (direct distance between points X and Y in Fig. 11) is 24.9\u00a0km. This corresponds almost exactly to the width of 25.1\u00a0km calculated after Wells and Coppersmith (1994) (Fig. SF 5). Thus, both the length and width of the modelled Dalmatian basal thrust are demonstrably within the expected range of a fault capable of triggering an MW 7.1 earthquake. Excluding the possibility of weaker earthquakes and\/or aseismic creep on this fault, the kinematic restoration of Section B allows an estimation of recurrence intervals: The total shortening that was needed to build the present-day bathymetric ridges (c. 2,300\u00a0m) would imply a total of 860 MW 7.1 earthquakes (with the average coseismic slip of 2.7\u00a0m each) since the end of Miocene (Fig. 12). This assumption results in an average recurrence interval of c. 6,200 years for MW 7.1 events among this fault segment. Even though localisation of earthquakes that were related to the 1667 Dubrovnik series come with high inaccuracies, damage reports indicate an overlapping with the 1979 Bar sequence. The fact that two MW 7.1 earthquakes (Dubrovnik, 1667 & Bar, 1979) took place in such short time and space clearly demonstrates the severe seismic hazard for this region. This gets even more interesting, when considering the heterogeneous distribution of contractional earthquakes along the deformation front (Fig. 3). Two regions with substantially lower seismic moment release show up: one segment around the city of Vlora and another one between Budva and Dubrovnik (Fig. 3). Based on the instrumental seismicity record, G\u00fclerce et al. (2017) considered the former as a region of lower seismic hazard. Considering the significantly more comprehensive geological record, we suspect that this region might experience ongoing convergence and therefore contributes to loading stresses on locked faults, creating a significantly increased risk of hosting strong earthquakes in the future. Most recent evidence is the 26.11.2019 MW 6.4 Albania earthquake that plots exactly in the contractional belt along the deformation front near Durres (Fig. 3b). Therefore, it is important to further elaborate on the seismic hazard in this region by expanding the GPS network and intensifying offshore geological exploration.\n\n\n9\nConclusion\nBy combining available and new on- and offshore data within the area of the 1979 Mw 7.1 earthquake, we were able to develop a kinematic model that implies seismogenic dislocation, which predominantly took place along the Dalmatian basal thrust. The reported Plio-Quaternary surface uplift of coastal regions as well as successive onlap sedimentation among the bathymetric ridges infer recent to active tectonics and therefore a co-seismic activation of the structure during the 1979 earthquake.\nOur structural interpretations on an extensive set of 2D reflection seismic lines and well data in combination with kinematic models based on cross section balancing conclusively show that the study area accommodated a considerable amount of shortening during the Neogene and Quaternary. The area hosted multiple strong earthquakes that still shape the recent landscape and affected coastal settlements as the cities of Bar, Budva, Kotor or Dubrovnik. We were able to link the seismic events of the 1979 earthquake series to the presence of bathymetric ridges offshore Montenegro via the basal thrust of the Dinarides-Hellenides fold-and-thrust belt. Several newly identified onshore and offshore morphotectonic features likely represent the cumulative effect of several thrust type earthquakes such as those in 1979. A kinematic restoration of the frontalmost, fault-related bathymetric ridges revealed a recurrence interval of MW\u00a0\u2265\u00a07 events every c. 6,200 years along this section of the fault, assuming that all shortening was seismogenic. Based on the heterogeneous distribution of seismic moment release in the larger study area, other segments along the coastal contractional belt reveal seismic gaps that indicate a severe seismic hazard in the future.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nBenjamin Schmitz: Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing, Visualization.

In this way we know stresses due to gravity (hydrostatic and lithostatic), tectonic stresses, structural stresses, and residual stresses. The term hydrostatic stress is used for a stress in which the principal stresses are equal, \n\n\n\u03c3\n1\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n2\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n3\n\n\n. If the density of rock is \n\u03c1\n, stresses which at depth z are hydrostatic and have the value \n\n\u03c1\ng\nz\n\n are termed lithostatic. Tectonic stresses cause faulting, fracturing and earthquakes, structural stresses are caused by inhomogeneities within the crust, and finally, residual stresses are \u201clocked-in\u201d stresses associated with the deformational history of the rock (Jaeger and Cook, 1969).\nIn the recent decades our understanding of tectonic and structural stresses has improved considerably due to numerous studies that for the purposes of this article can be roughly divided into the following groups:\n\nWorld Stress Map project (WSM); This project was initiated by Zoback and Zoback (1980), Zoback et al. (1989), Zoback and Zoback (1991), Zoback (1992), later followed by Sperner et al. (2003), Heidbach et al. (2007, 2010, 2016a,b, 2018). The WSM is a global compilation of information on the present-day tectonic stresses. The 2016 database release contained 42,870 data records on events that happened within the upper 40\u00a0km of the Earth's crust. The number of data records grows each year. The stress indicators are grouped into four categories: (1) earthquake focal mechanisms, (2) well-bore breakouts and drilling-induced fractures, (3) in-situ stress measurements such as overcoring, hydraulic fracturing, borehole slotter, and (4) recent geologic data from fault-slip analysis and volcanic vent alignments. These studies, and also many other studies at the local, regional, and global levels, for example, by Bada et al. (2007), Tingay et al. (2010), Montone et al. (2012), Hurt and Zoback (2012), Yang and Hauksson (2013), Reiter at al. (2014), Czirok (2016), and Tutu et al. (2018), have shown that the regional tectonic stress patterns could be interpreted to a certain extent as homogeneous, and clearly linked to global plate tectonics. Maximum horizontal compression directions \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2192\n\n\nH\nmax\n\n\n\n due to tectonic stresses are often being almost parallel over vast regions, even on continental scales. In addition, there are higher order stress patterns that can be interpreted as structural stresses according to the definitions of Jaeger and Cook (1969).\nIn parallel to the studies related to the World Stress Map project, the second group of studies was carried out in relation to fault-slip analyses and (paleo)stress reconstructions based on direct observations and measurements of fault planes and direction of slip along these planes. Central to these studies is the so-called Wallace-Bott's hypothesis (Wallace, 1951; Bott, 1959), which assumes parallelism between fault slip and shear stress direction. In the past, numerous numerical methods have been developed to resolve the stress tensor \u03c3 from the observation of slip directions along multiplicity of fault planes, following, for example, Carey and Brunier (1974), Angelier and Mechler (1977), Angelier (1979, 1984, 1989, 1990, 1994), Etchecopar et al. (1981), Armijo et al. (1982), Fleischman and Nemcok (1991), Will and Powell (1991), Fry (1992, 1999, 2001), Arlegui-Crespo and Sim\u00f3n-G\u00f3mez (1998), and many others. These studies confirmed the so-called homogeneous stress hypothesis, and showed that the slip direction along multiplicity of differently orientated faults can actually be well explained by a single common stress tensor \u03c3. This enabled the reconstruction of ancient stress states in rocks in the geological past, the so-called paleostresses (e.g., Angelier, 1994). Many studies showed that paleostresses were also approximately homogeneous with parallel maximum horizontal direction \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2192\n\n\nH\nmax\n\n\n\n over vast distances up to continental scales. Such homogeneity of tectonic stress has been observed at all scales, on the level of an outcrop, on the local level and also for larger tectonic faults. This scale-invariance of the stress-to-fault-slip relation is a very important feature of tectonic faulting, and shows that small tectonic faults contain as much information about the local and regional tectonic stresses as larger faults. The presence of structural stresses on the smaller scales only affects the degree of natural dispersions within the fault-slip data.\nThe third group of studies relates to structural stresses and is generally referred to as Coulomb stress transfer or Coulomb stress changes around tectonic faults due to local discrete slip along them. This process is well studied, for example, by King et al. (1994), Stein et al. (1997), Parsons and Dreger (2000), Beeler et al. (2000), Ch\u00e9ry et al. (2001), Kilb et al. (2002), Stein (2003), Steacy et al. (2005), Bufe (2006), Ali et al. (2008), Durand et al. (2013), Mildon et al. (2016), Maede et al. (2017), Hodge et al. (2018), and Ahadov and Jin (2019) to name some of them. Through the application of various computer programs such as Coulomb 3.3 (Lin and Stein, 2004; Toda et al., 2005) and other similar software, complex models of fault arrays have been built incorporating multiple fault planes, for example, by King et al. (1994), Cakir et al. (2003), Nostro et al. (2005), Ishibe et al. (2011), and Strader and Jackson (2015). These studies have shown that structural stresses related to Coulomb stress changes are highly inhomogeneous, and produce high stress and strain gradients around active tectonic faults. The origin of the relatively homogeneous tectonic stress is therefore much different from the origin of the non-homogeneous structural stresses, and a clear distinction should be made between the two types of stress. The tectonic stress is not produced by Coulomb stress changes around multiplicity of fault planes in the Earth's crust, but its cause is rather related to the global plate tectonics and the movements of large tectonic plates.\nFinally, the last group of research is related to the implementation of the theories of generalized continua to describe geologic faulting. The classical and mainstream approach in seismology, structural geology, and geophysics is to describe the deformation of rocks within the framework of the so-called classical or Cauchy continuum, where the stress tensor is symmetric and couple-stresses are absent. In contrast, the higher-grade continua include higher derivatives of the displacement fields, and the higher-order continua include additional degrees of freedom (e.g., Forest and Sievert, 2003). One such example of the higher-order continuum is the Cosserat continuum, which includes independent rotations of the micro-elements of the continuum. The first to apply the Cosserat theory in structural geology to describe geological faulting, rotation of blocks between the geological faults were Twiss et al. (1991, 1993), Unruh et al. (1996), Twiss and Unruh (1998), Figueiredo et al. (2004), Twiss and Unruh (2007), and Twiss (2009). The most recent continuation of these early theories finds its place in the work of \u017dalohar and Vrabec (2010), and \u017dalohar (2012, 2014, 2018).\nWhile the models on Coulomb stress transfer (structural stresses) are relatively often used to improve the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment models (PSHA), such studies are far less numerous for the case of tectonic stresses. The relationship between the world's current tectonic stresses and the occurrence of large earthquakes is relatively poorly understood. There have been attempts to discover correlations between the earthquake focal mechanisms (e.g., Kagan, 2000), and to use the focal mechanisms for the PSHA purposes, for example, by Kagan and Jackson (1994, 2000, 2001), Roselli and Mariucci (2016) and Roselli et al. (2018). In this article we develop new numerical techniques to calculate the world's tectonic stresses and their time-development based on the earthquakes focal mechanisms catalogs. We use the Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog (https:\/\/www.globalcmt.org), but other similar catalogs may also be used. In the next step, we test the correlations between the calculated global tectonic stress fields and the magnitudes of the earthquakes. We discover a new physical law, which connects the magnitude of the normalized shear stress in a region and the maximum possible magnitude of the earthquake in that region. Finally, we discuss the possible physical origin of this law. All numerical tests have been performed by using T-TECTO Omega-Architect computer program. The results were visualzed by Quantectum GIS software.\n\n\n2\nMaterial and methods\n\n2.1\nStress and strain measures\nPossible characteristics of constitutive equations relating stress and strain for the faulting related deformations in the Earth's crust (cataclastic flow) were first discussed by Twiss and Unruh (1998). They recognized three principal driving mechanisms that should be incorporated: (1) elastic properties of the blocks bounded by the faults, (2) frictional sliding on the shear surfaces (faults), and (3) plastic deformation and brittle fracture of rocks (e.g., Twiss and Unruh, 1998; Dartevelle, 2003). The exact mathematical model was then formulated for the Cosserat continuum by \u017dalohar and Vrabec (2010), and \u017dalohar (2012, 2018), who presented the cataclastic flow model based on the J2 plasticity theory. Their model also explains the relationship between the Cosserat and Cauchy continuum models for the Earth's crust and describes the Cauchy continuum as a special type of the more general Cosserat model.\nBasic strain and stress measures for the Cosserat continuum are the Cosserat strain tensor e\n\np\n, torsion-curvature tensor \u03ba\n\np\n, stress tensor \u03c3, and couple-stress tensor \u03bc. According to the Toupin (1962, 1964) and Forest and Sievert (2003), the torsion-curvature tensor is related to the gradient of the Cosserat strain, which according to the homogeneous stress hypothesis on the regional level (scale) is assumed to be negligible (e.g., Babar et al., 2017; Kaplay et al., 2017). Therefore, also the torsion-curvature and rate of torsion-curvature tensors are supposed to be negligible, \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\u02d9\n\np\n\n\u2248\n0\n\n and \u03ba\n\np\n \u2248 0 (see also \u017dalohar, 2018, Chapter 6, for the detail discussion). According \u017dalohar and Vrabec (2010), and \u017dalohar (2012, 2018), the cataclastic flow model based on the J2 plasticity theory leads to the following constitutive\/viscosity equations relating stress tensor to the rate of Cosserat strain tensor:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c3\n=\n\np\nr\n\n1\n+\n2\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\np\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the index (S) denotes the symmetric part of the tensor. In the homogeneous regional strain fields and in the far field (far from the neighbourhood of the fault planes), the faulting-related deformation of the Earth's crust can be described within the framework of the classical Cauchy continuum theory. However, as soon as gradients of the strain become high, and also in the near field (close to the fault planes), the Cosserat effects become important.\n\n\n2.2\nMoment tensor summation in seismology\nAccording to Kostrov (1974) and Molnar (1983), the calculation of incremental strain due to faulting and earthquakes in a region has been solved by using seismic moment tensor summation:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\ni\nj\n\n\n=\n\n1\n\n2\nG\nT\nV\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\n\nM\nS\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n\nm\n\ni\nj\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n is the total faulting related strain rate, G is the shear modulus, V is the volume of the deforming medium, T is the time period of the earthquake record, and \n\n\nM\nS\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nm\n\ni\nj\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n=\n\nm\nk\n\n\n are the seismic moment and the moment tensor belonging to the k\u2212th fault\/earthquake, respectively (Reches, 1978, 1983; Marrett and Allmendinger, 1990; Kreemer et al., 2000). The seismic moment is defined as M\n\nS\n\u00a0=\u00a0GM, where M is the geometric moment. Note that the moment tensor does not account for any volume changes. \u017dalohar (2018) also showed that \n\n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\np\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n.\nMajor shortcoming of the original models for moment tensor summation, e.g. Equation (2), is that these models do not account for the results for the fault-slip data analysis studies and paleostress reconstructions. As we already discussed in the Introduction chapter, the fault-slip and paleostress analyses indicated the scale-invariance of the stress-to-fault-slip relation in the Earth's crust. Small tectonic faults contain equal amount of information on the local and regional tectonic stresses as the larger faults (scale-invariance hypothesis). The presence of structural stresses on the smaller scales only affects the degree of natural dispersions within the fault-slip data. Contrary to this philosophy, the moment tensors \n\n\nm\n\ni\nj\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n\n in Equation (2) are multiplied (weighted) by the seismic moment \n\n\nM\nS\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n\n of an earthquakes, and all terms in the sum are divided by the same volume V. Because the seismic moment of large earthquakes is considerably greater compared to smaller earthquakes, Equation (2) directly violates the scale invariance hypothesis. At the same time, Equation (2) implicitly assumes all earthquakes in the region contribute to the deformation of the complete region with the volume V. This is far from true, since smaller earthquakes can be considered as approximately point sources compared to the extended sources of large earthquakes and the region. On the global scale, the same can also be said for the large earthquakes. It is reasonable to assume that the contribution of a fault\/earthquake to the complete regional\/global strain rate field is largest near the fault plane and drops at larger distances. Therefore, Equation (2) should be improved to account for these effects, and the following model is introduced here:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n=\n\n1\nT\n\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\n\n\nw\nk\n\n\nm\nk\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\nk\n\n\/\n\nL\nC\n\n\n)\n\nn\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, w\n\nk\n is the weight, which can have the values either \n\n\nw\nk\n\n=\n\nM\nS\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n\n (weighted model) or w\n\nk\n\u00a0=\u00a01 (unweighted model). The unweighted model takes into account the scale invariance hypothesis, while the weighted model violates it. In addition, r\n\nk\n is the distance to the epicenter of the k-th fault\/earthquake, and L\n\nC\n is the Cosserat characteristic length. In the Cosserat continuum we introduce the dimensionless distance r\n\nk\n\/L\n\nC\n, which defines the rotation of the material in different scales of observations (e.g., \u017dalohar, 2018). The exact mathematical description of rotations in the Cosserat continuum far exceeds the scope of this article, and is reviewed in detail by \u017dalohar (2018). Note that in Equation (3) the same characteristic length L\n\nC\n is used for all earthquakes, independent of their seismic moment or magnitude. Such approach is unknown and unusual in the classical Cauchy continuum and is strictly borrowed from the Cosserat continuum. The power factor n in the above equation can have values n\u00a0=\u00a01, n\u00a0=\u00a02 or n\u00a0=\u00a03, where n\u00a0=\u00a01 reflects far-field effects, n\u00a0=\u00a02 reflects intermediate-field effects, and n\u00a0=\u00a03 reflects the near-field effects. This is similar as in the elastic theory of point sources in seismology and elastomechanics (e.g., Udias, 1999). Thus, the above Equation (3) allows for formulation of many different weighted or unweighted models. Scale invariance of stress is a useful approximation, but not a fundamental fact, therefore, assuming scale invariance may lead to results that are governed by this assumption, not by the behavior of the Earth itself. Therefore, weighted and unweighted models with different characteristic lengths should be critically evaluated and checked whether or not they give any physically meaningful results. This is the aim of this article.\nAccording to Equation (1), the tectonic stress tensor can be calculated from the symmetric part of the strain rate tensor \n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n; \n\n\u03c3\n=\n\np\nr\n\n1\n+\n2\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n.\n\n The problem is, however, that the values of the parameters p\n\nr\n and \n\n2\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n\n are unknown. Therefore, the only possibility is to calculate the normalized reduced stress tensor \u03c3\n(r) in the following way:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n(\n6\n)\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n(\n6\n)\n\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n11\n\n,\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n22\n\n,\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n33\n\n,\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n12\n\n,\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n23\n\n,\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n13\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis the six-dimensional vector in the Fry's(1999, 2001) \u201cstress space\u201d that corresponds to the symmetric part of the strain rate tensor \n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n and\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n(\n6\n)\n\n\n\u2016\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n11\n2\n\n+\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n22\n2\n\n+\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n33\n2\n\n+\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n12\n2\n\n+\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n23\n2\n\n+\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n13\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis the norm of this vector.

In the following, we will only concentrate the analysis on the near-field effects by using n\u00a0=\u00a03 in Equation (3). In this study, we use the Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog (https:\/\/www.globalcmt.org), which contains information on time, location, seismic moment, magnitude, moment tensor, and nodal planes for each earthquake. The following stress measures are then calculated everywhere on Earth within some user-defined resolution.\nThe normalized shear stress\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n is calculated as the shear stress produced by the normalized reduced stress tensor \u03c3\n(r) on a fault plane with the unit normal vector \n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\n:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nn\no\nr\n.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u2016\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\u22c5\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\u2016\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe relative normalized shear stress\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nr\ne\nl\n.\n)\n\n\n\n is defined as the relative ratio between the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n and the maximum value of the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n in a chosen region:\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nr\ne\nl\n.\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\nmax\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the global level, usually \n\nmax\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n=\n1\n\n, therefore \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nr\ne\nl\n.\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n. The distinction between \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nr\ne\nl\n.\n)\n\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n is important on the regional or local level, where \n\nmax\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\u2264\n1\n\n. In this case, it is sometimes more convenient to plot the charts of the relative normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nr\ne\nl\n.\n)\n\n\n\n to illustrate slight variations of the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n. Charts of the normalized shear stress or relative normalized shear stress are then produced by calculating the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n on all nodal planes contained in the seismic catalog (for example in the CMT catalog). Based on the theory of focal mechanisms (e.g., Udias, 1999), one of the nodal planes belonging to each earthquake is assumed to be the true fault plane. In some tectonic zone at the locality \n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n we may have several earthquakes with different values of the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n. Therefore, the following numerical method is used to construct the actual field of \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n at some locality \n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n. The normalized shear stress field \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n at a specific point \n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n is defined as the maximum value of the \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n values on any nodal plane within the circular region with the radius L\n\nS\n around that point:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n(\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n)\n\n=\nmax\n\n{\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n;\n\u00a0\n\nr\nk\n\n\u2264\n\nL\nS\n\n\n}\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, r\n\nk\n is the distance between the point of interest \n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n and the epicentre of an earthquake associated with the k-th nodal plane. An example of a chart illustrating the global relative normalized shear stress field is given in Fig. 1\n for the time period 01\/01\/2018\u201303\/07\/2018. White colour indicates the absence of any earthquakes, which is equivalent to no or low values of the relative normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nr\ne\nl\n.\n)\n\n\n\n. The red colour indicates high values of the relative normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nr\ne\nl\n.\n)\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n3.2\nTest 1; time-development of the tectonic strain and stress fields\nIn Test 1, we analyzed how the world's global stress fields change with time. We concentrated our analysis to the time period 01\/01\/2017\u201303\/09\/2019 and split the CMT catalog into 27 subcatalogs with the 6 months (183 days) time ranges given in Table 1\n. In the second step, we calculated the global strain rate tensor field \n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n and the normalized reduced stress tensor field \u03c3\n(r) with resolution of one degree. This means that both fields were calculated in 64,800 grid points on Earth. In the third step, various charts were produced illustrating the normalized shear stress as described in the previous subchapter 3.1. The results are described in continuation.\n\nFig. 2\n illustrates the field of the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n in the region of Japan for the subcatalogs No. 10, 15, 20, and 25 in Table 1, and for the 300\u00a0km Cosserat characteristic length L\n\nC\n in Equation (3). We used the unweighted model. Based on these charts we conclude that the field of the normalized shear stress is highly variable with time. During certain time periods, some regions may experience high normalized shear stress (red to black colours), and later the normalized shear stress drops considerably (blue to yellow colours). It is important to have in mind that these charts do not represent strain, for example, by assuming the constant stress and varying \u201cstrength\u201d of the faults in the seismically active tectonic zones. This seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that the tectonic plate boundaries are weaker, rather than more stressed compared to the internal parts of the plates and cratons. However, from the point of Cosserat theory, and also based on the results illustrated in Fig. 2, there is a clear relationship between the rate-of-strain and tectonic stress, Equation (1). If the rate-of-strain increases, the tectonic stress increases as well. Therefore, results illustrated in Fig. 2 clearly indicate changes in tectonic shear stresses at the tectonic plate boundaries. At the same time, the shear stress is defined only where active faulting takes place. In the absence of shear planes (faults), we can speak of shear stress only theoretically even if the actual stress is high.\n\n\n3.3\nTest 2: earthquake magnitude dependence on shear stress; regional level\nIn Test 2, we compared the field of the normalized shear stress with the magnitudes of the earthquakes for the same region of Japan as is illustrated in Fig. 2 in Test 1. One such example is illustrated in Fig. 3\n for the subcatalog No. 10 in Table 1, and for the 300\u00a0km Cosserat characteristic length L\n\nC\n in Equation (3). Similar results were obtained also for other subcatalog numbers in Table 1. Careful examination of the chart in Fig. 3A shows that the distribution of the largest earthquakes (largest black circles) well corresponds to the distribution of the areas experiencing highest normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n. All largest earthquakes clearly happened in the red-black areas (high normalized shear stress). Fig. 3B shows graph, where we plot the relative normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n (the maximum value within the 100\u00a0km circular regions around the epicentres) on the x-axis (shear stress) and the magnitudes of the earthquakes in the selected area of Japan on the y-axis.\nWe conducted thousands of such tests worldwide, and in all cases the dependence of the maximum possible magnitude M\nmax of the largest earthquakes on \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n is logarithmic according to the following equation:\n\n(10)\n\n\n\nM\nmax\n\n=\n\nM\n0\n\n+\nK\n\nlog\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the largest earthquakes in Fig. 3B are clearly positioned along the red line defined by equation \n\n\nM\nmax\n\n=\n8\n+\n11\n\nlog\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n. There also exists another population of earthquakes, which have the magnitudes defined by the blue line; \n\nM\n\u2264\n7.3\n+\n11\n\nlog\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n. The parameter K for the red and the blue lines is equal to 11, but the two lines are displaced in the vertical direction for the magnitude \u0394M\n0\u00a0=\u00a00.7. This will be discussed in detail in the discussion chapter.\n\n\n3.4\nTest 4; oscillations of the shear stress field before large earthquakes\nBased on Tests 1 and 2, large earthquakes are expected to occur in the strongest normalized shear stress fields \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n. Therefore, we concentrated the analysis to the largest earthquakes that happened after January 01, 2017. Figs. 4 and 5\n\n illustrate oscillations of the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n within 250\u00a0km circular regions around the epicentres of four M7.9+ earthquakes:\n\n1.\n\nFig. 4A and B; Mw\u00a0=\u00a08.1; offshore Chiapas, Mexico on September 08, 2017,\n\n\n2.\n\nFig. 4C and D; Mw\u00a0=\u00a07.9; Gulf of Alaska on January 23, 2018,\n\n\n3.\n\nFig. 5A and B; Mw\u00a0=\u00a08.2; Fiji region on August 19, 2018,\n\n\n4.\n\nFig. 5C and D; Mw\u00a0=\u00a08; Northern Peru on May 26, 2019.\n\n\n\nThe graphs show time on the x-axis and the normalized shear stress field \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n on the y-axis. In addition, black columns illustrate the magnitudes of the four earthquakes (also on the y-axis). In all four cases, the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n attained very high values at the time of the events, larger than 85% or 0.85. In three cases, namely the Mexico, Fiji and Peru earthquakes, the normalized shear stress was higher that 90% or 0.9. Two scenarios can be observed (Figs. 4 and 5):\n\nA)\nThe normalized shear stress was already high (long) before the actual earthquake (Mexico and Fiji earthquakes)\n\n\nB)\nThe normalized shear stress started to increase several months before the actual earthquakes (Alaska and Peru earthquakes)\n\n\n\nFor example, in the case of the Peru Mw\u00a0=\u00a08 earthquake on May 26, 2019, the normalized shear stress field was relatively moderate in December 2018 with values around 0.73, but then started to increase, achieving values around 0.9 in May 2019, just before the earthquake.\nWe made an additional test, where we compared the maximum normalized shear stress field \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nmax\n)\n\n\n\n at the time of the earthquakes T\n0\u00b131 days (Fig. 6\n). We compared two populations of earthquakes; (1) moderate to strong M6.5 - M7.5 magnitude earthquakes, and (2) strong M7.5+ earthquakes. The blue line on Fig. 6 illustrates the 5 days average value of \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nmax\n)\n\n\n\n for the population No. 1 (moderate to strong earthquakes), while the red line illustrates the 5 days average value of \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nmax\n)\n\n\n\n for the population No. 2 (strong earthquakes). The average values were calculated over the 5 days in which such earthquakes actually happened. The gray line in Fig. 6 illustrates the \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nmax\n)\n\n\n\n values for the population No. 2 earthquakes (strong earthquakes). Based on this graphs, it is clear that strong earthquakes on average happened in stronger normalized shear stress fields compared to moderate to strong earthquakes. Although the difference is small, it can still be clearly distinguished, since the red line is above the blue one.\n\n\n3.5\nTest 5: historical M8+ earthquakes after 1976\nWe made similar tests as described above for all M8+ earthquakes (in the USGS catalog) after the beginning of the CMT catalog; from 1976 till 2018. The analysis of the strongest M7.5+ earthquakes in the last two years (2018\u20132020) is covered separately in the previous subchapters. Note that the CMT catalog was used to calculate the normalized shear stress field. In this test, the CMT catalog was split into 526 subcatalogs with the 12 months time ranges and one month step forward, for example; 01\/01\/1976-01\/01\/1977, 01\/02\/1976-01\/02\/1977, etc \u2026 In the second step, we calculated the global strain rate tensor field \n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n and the normalized reduced stress tensor field \u03c3\n(r) with resolution of one degree. We used the 800\u00a0km Cosserat characteristic length L\n\nC\n in Equation (3), and the unweighted model. The field of the normalized shear stress was calculated in 64,800 grid points on Earth. Charts were produced illustrating the normalized shear stress as described in the previous subchapter 3.1.\nThe 32 analyzed earthquakes are listed in Table 2\n (Name, Date, Location, Depth, Magnitude). The last column in this table is related to the values of the average normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n shortly before the earthquakes in the radius 500\u00a0km around the epicentres. These values are also illustrated in Fig. 7\n. Table 2 and Fig. 7 show that high majority (28 earthquakes, 81.25%) of strong M8+ earthquakes happened in very strong normalized shear stress fields, larger than 0.8. Only 6 (= 18.75%) M8+ earthquakes happened in \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n<\n0.8\n\n. Note that moderate M4+ earthquakes can happen in much weaker normalized shear stress field, \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\u2265\n0.5\n\n (compare Fig. 3). This confirms, previous assumptions that in general only strong normalized shear stress field \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n generate very large earthquakes.\nAn illustrative example of how the normalized shear stress increased before an actual large earthquake is illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9\n\n for the great Tohoku 9.1 magnitude earthquake on March 11, 2011. Fig. 8 illustrates four charts for the time periods; (A) 01\/11\/2009-01\/11\/2010, (B) 01\/01\/2010-01\/01\/2011, (C) 01\/03\/2010-01\/03\/2011, and (D) 01\/04\/2010-01\/04\/2011. In (A), the future epicentral region of the great Tohoku earthquake was under moderate normalized shear stress around 0.77. In (B) and (C), we observe an increase of the normalized shear stress toward the value of 0.87. This increase started approximately 3\u20134 months before the earthquake (Fig. 9). Finally, the great Tohoku earthquake is associated with intense increase of the normalized shear stress toward 1.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nNew physical law for earthquakes\nIn this article, we show that a new and previously unknown physical law for earthquakes exists, which connects the value of the normalized shear stress in a specific tectonic zone to the maximum possible magnitude of an earthquake that the particular tectonic zone can produce \n\n\nM\nmax\n\n=\n\nM\n0\n\n+\nK\n\nlog\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n, where M\n0 and K are some time-dependent parameters. This law will be called the maximum magnitude law (MM-law). Only the main shocks achieve this maximum magnitude M\nmax, while other earthquakes, such as swarms, aftershocks or foreshocks, achieve lower magnitudes. In numerous cases we observe two or more populations of earthquakes. The first population are the largest earthquakes that follow their own equation \n\n\nM\nmax\n\n=\n\nM\n0\n\n+\nK\n\nlog\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n. The second population are relatively weaker earthquakes (with respect to the largest ones) that follow equation \n\nM\n\u2264\n\nM\n0\n\u2217\n\n+\nK\n\nlog\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n with the same parameter K, but with lower value of \n\n\nM\n0\n\u2217\n\n\n with respect to M\n0. In most cases we have\n\n(11)\n\n\n\nM\n0\n\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\u2217\n\n=\n\u0394\n\nM\n0\n\n<\n1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that everywhere and irrespective of the magnitude of the main shocks, the difference between the magnitude of the main shocks M and largest aftershocks\/forechocks m is some defined value \u0394M\n0:\n\n(12)\n\n\nM\n\u2212\nm\n=\n\u0394\n\nM\n0\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recognize this as the well known B\u00e5th's law (B\u00e5th, 1965). A number of extensive studies of the statistical variability of B\u00e5th's law have been carried out (Vere-Jones, 1969; Shcherbakov and Turcotte, 2004; Saichev and Sornete, 2005; Kisslinger and Jones, 1991; Console et al., 2003; Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002; Vere-Jones et al., 2006; Lombardi, 2002), however, these studies were unable to explain the physical origin of this law. \u017dalohar (2014, 2018) developed and described a new approach in understanding the physical basis of B\u00e5th's law, and derived it from equations describing faults interaction and block rotations in the Cosserat continuum. It is however, a great surprise to find this law also in the relationship describing the magnitude on normalized shear stress dependence as described in this article. This suggests that our current understanding of the Cosserat mechanics of faulting and earthquakes (\u017dalohar, 2018) is quite consistent and reliable.\nThe physical origin of the maximum magnitude law (MM-law) can be resolved by taking into account Equation (10) and the energy-magnitude relation for earthquakes (Kanamori and Anderson, 1975):\n\n(13)\n\n\nlog\n\nE\n=\n4.8\n+\n\n2\n3\n\nM\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nit follows:\n\n(14)\n\n\nlog\n\n\nE\nmax\n\n=\n\n3\n2\n\n\n(\n\nM\n0\n\n+\n4.8\n)\n\n+\n\n3\n2\n\nK\n\nlog\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using K\u00a0=\u00a04\/3, this can be written in the following form:\n\n(15)\n\n\n\nE\nmax\n\n=\nk\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n2\n\n,\n\n\n\nwith \n\nk\n=\n\n10\n\n\n(\n\n3\n\/\n2\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\nM\n0\n\n+\n4.8\n)\n\n\n\n\n . Since the maximum elastic shear energy density is defined as\n\n(16)\n\n\n\nw\nmax\n\n=\n\n\nE\nmax\n\n\nV\nC\n\n\n~\n\n1\n2\n\nG\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n2\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nit follows:\n\n(17)\n\n\n\nE\nmax\n\n=\n\nw\nmax\n\n\nV\nC\n\n~\n\nV\nC\n\n\n1\n2\n\nG\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n2\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that \n\nk\n=\n\n10\n\n\n(\n\n3\n\/\n2\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\nM\n0\n\n+\n4.8\n)\n\n\n\n~\n0.5\n\nV\nC\n\nG\n\n. In the above equations, \n\n\nV\nC\n\n=\n\nL\nC\n3\n\n\n is the cell volume, and L\n\nC\n is the Cosserat characteristic length.\nBased on the above discussion, the maximum magnitude law, Equation (10), can be explained as the consequence of the elastic shear energy released from the cellular structure of the Earth's crust with the Cosserat characteristic length L\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n. When L\n\nC\n is constant for all earthquakes in a region, then the expected value of the parameter K is 4\/3. Higher values of the parameter K may indicate complex relationship between the normalized shear stress and the Cosserat characteristic lengths for different magnitudes of earthquakes. This is certainly a problem worth of detailed future studies.\n\n\n4.2\nPrecursory stress changes before large earthquakes\nThe maximum magnitude law (MM-law) describes the logarithmic dependence between the maximum possible earthquake magnitude in a tectonic zone and the normalized shear stress in this tectonic zone. The higher the values of the normalized shear stress, the larger the possible maximum magnitudes. This allows for the hypothesis that very large earthquakes are only possible in the regions with the highest normalized shear stresses. In this article we described some tests that confirm this hypothesis. In Test 3, we concentrated our analysis on the largest M7.5+ earthquakes that happened on Earth after January 01, 2017. We showed that the average normalized shear stress field associated with M7.5+ earthquakes is indeed higher than the average normalized shear stress associated with moderate to strong M6.5 \u2013 M7.5 earthquakes (Fig. 6). The differences are not high, but are statistically well defined. Two scenarios can be observed in connection with even stronger M7.9+ earthquakes (Figs. 4 and 5). In the first scenario, the normalized shear stress was already high (long) before the actual earthquake. In the second scenario, however, the normalized shear stress was initially moderate, but began to increase several months before the actual earthquake. Here we discuss a new and important earthquake precursor \u2013 the normalized tectonic shear stress (the mechanism also works for the normalized driving stress). It shows there is an increased probability of very large earthquakes in those regions, where the normalized shear stress increases significantly. This was also verified and illustrated in Test 5, where we analyzed the values of the normalized shear stress before large historical M8+ earthquakes in the time period from 1976 till 2018.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this article we discover a new and previously unknown physical law for earthquakes, which defines the maximum possible magnitude M\nmax of an earthquake and the value of the normalized tectonic shear stress field \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n (or normalized driving stress \n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n) in tectonic zones on Earth. This law describes a logarithmic dependence of M\nmax on \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n of the form \n\n\nM\nmax\n\n=\n\nM\n0\n\n+\nK\n\nlog\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n)\n\n, and is called the maximum magnitude law (MM-law). The parameters M\n0 and K depend on time and place. The most important consequence of this law is, however, that the largest M7.5+ or even M8+ earthquakes only occur in the highest\/strongest normalized tectonic shear stress fields, which change over time. Two scenarios are observed. In the first scenario, the normalized shear stress was already high (long) before the actual earthquake. In the second scenario, the normalized shear stress was initially moderate, but began to increase several months before the actual earthquake. In this article we discovered and described an important new earthquake precursor \u2013 the normalized tectonic shear stress. There is an increased probability of very large earthquakes in those regions, where the normalized shear stress increases significantly. These changes are precursory. They occur months before the large earthquakes. This means they can be used as a tool in the development of advanced time-dependent PSHA models.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJure \u017dalohar: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Writing - original draft.

A variety of different fault damage zones have been identified and classified in the literature depending on their location relevant to the parent fault(s), including but not limited to: tip, wall, linkage, interaction and fault bend damage zones (i.e. Kim et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2016; Peacock et al., 2017). Such damage zones form due to local stress concentrations or perturbations along or between faults, often accommodating variations in the distribution of strain and displacement (e.g. Kim et al., 2000, 2001; Nixon et al., 2019). They commonly consist of numerous fractures (e.g. veins, joints, small faults, deformation bands, stylolites etc.) of different scales, types and orientations, forming networks that contribute to the overall deformation of the rock.\nA detailed understanding of the development of the different structures within fault damage zones can provide valuable insights on processes of fault growth and development (Cowie and Shipton, 1998; Kim et al., 2003; Shipton and Cowie, 2003; Fossen et al., 2005; Childs et al., 2009; Faulkner et al., 2011) as well as earthquake initiation and rupture patterns (King, 1986; Sibson, 1989; Kim and Sanderson, 2008; Soliva et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2012; Johri et al., 2014; Perrin et al., 2016). Of particular economic significance is the control of fault damage on fluid flow and rock permeability in the upper crust (Caine et al., 1996; Shipton et al., 2002; Leckenby et al., 2005; Kim and Sanderson, 2010; Mitchell and Faulkner, 2012; Ogata et al., 2014; Dimmen et al., 2017, 2020). Thus damage zones can be crucial factors when exploring for water aquifers (e.g. Huyakorn et al., 1983), ore mineral deposits (e.g. Curewitz and Karson, 1997), hydrocarbon reservoirs (e.g. Gartrell et al., 2004; Fossen et al., 2005; Rotevatn et al., 2007) and storage sites for CO2 (e.g. Shipton et al., 2004; Dockrill and Shipton, 2010).\nA plethora of literature, therefore, exists on fault damage zones with studies mainly focusing on characterising damage zone architectures and geometries (e.g. McGrath and Davison, 1995; Kim et al., 2001, 2004; Berg and Skar, 2005; Johansen and Fossen, 2008; Gudmundsson et al., 2010; Rotevatn and Bastesen, 2014; Choi et al., 2016; Peacock et al., 2017), geometric dimensions of damage zones and subsequent scaling relationships with fault displacement\/length (e.g. Hull, 1988; Knott et al., 1996; Vermilye and Scholz, 1998; Beach et al., 1999; Shipton and Cowie, 2001; Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009; Faulkner et al., 2011), fracture abundances and distributions within damage zones (e.g. Micarelli et al., 2003, 2006; Berg and Skar, 2005; Savage and Brodsky, 2011) and the effects of damage on physical rock properties such as permeability (e.g. Caine et al., 1996; Shipton et al., 2002; Mitchell and Faulkner, 2012). Less attention, however, has been given to characterising the arrangement (topology) and connectivity of the fractures within fault damage zones. This is important as fracture connectivity is crucial for assessing percolation potential and thus fluid flow through a rock body (Adler and Thovert, 1999; Manzocchi, 2002; Sanderson and Nixon, 2018). This is especially the case in low permeability rocks, such as the carbonate rocks used in this study, where permeability is often solely reliant on fractures and their connectivity (Faulkner et al., 2010).\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the topological characteristics of different fault damage zones, with a focus on quantifying the development of fracture connectivity. The study applies a topological analysis based on graph theory (i.e. Sanderson et al., 2019) to examples of damage zones associated with metre-scale extensional faults observed in carbonate rocks along the western coast of Malta (Fig. 1\n). A topological analysis provides a description of the geometrical relationships between the fractures within a network and is essential for assessing fracture network connectivity (Jing and Stephansson, 1997; Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018). The topological character of a fracture network is important as two fracture networks can have similar geometries (trace lengths, orientations and fracture intensities) but different topologies and thus connectivity, which could result in very different fluid flow properties (e.g. Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018). Therefore, this study focuses on constraining the potential variations in topology and connectivity of fracture networks within different fault damage zones. We explore the differences and similarities between the different types of damage zone, producing a topology-based classification scheme that describes both the connectivity and complexity of their fracture networks. Finally, we extrapolate the results to discuss how fracture networks develop within damage zones by using the different studied examples, with varying degrees of structural complexity, as proxies for damage zone maturity.\n\n\n2\nDamage zone terminology\nNumerous studies have proposed different classification and nomenclature schemes for describing fault damage zones. Kim et al. (2004) define tip, wall and linkage damage zones based on their location around subparallel segmented faults. Peacock et al. (2017) broaden this classification to include interaction damage zones around non-parallel and non-synchronous faults including intersection and approaching damage zones. Choi et al. (2016) use along-fault, around-tip and cross-fault damage, an approach that describes a damage zone based on the plane of observation and the damage zone position around an exposed fault. In this paper we follow the recommendation of Peacock et al. (2017) and use a prefix based on the damage zones\u2019 location in order to distinguish the three different types of studied damage zone (Fig. 2\n):\n\n\u2022\n\nTip-damage zones refer to damage around the lateral tips of an extensional fault, observed in plan-view. The damage in these zones is related to increased stresses at the tips of faults as they grow and propagate (e.g. Cowie and Scholz, 1992; Vermilye and Scholz, 1998). These are the same as tip damage zones described by Kim et al. (2004) and could either be mixed mode or mode III tip damage according to the around-tip damage zone classification of Choi et al. (2016).\n\n\n\u2022\n\nRelay-damage zones refer to damage around geometrically or kinematically linked, synchronous, sub-parallel and overlapping extensional faults, observed in plan-view. These damage zones can be associated with different stages of fault segment linkage from relay ramp structures between soft-linked faults to fully breached relays of hard-linked faults. The damage in these zones is related to fault interaction often accommodating the transfer of strain or displacement between two fault segments (e.g. Peacock and Sanderson, 1991, 1994; Huggins et al., 1995). These damage zones are equivalent to along-fault linkage damage zones (Kim et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2016).\n\n\n\u2022\n\nSplay-damage zones represent damage associated with upward splaying or bifurcating, synthetic faults that are observed in cross-section. These may be cross-sectional views of either a relay-damage zone or a mode III tip-damage zone, which could be considered as cross-fault damage or an around-tip damage, respectively (Choi et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nThese different damage zones are associated with local stresses during the propagation and linkage of faults as they grow and develop. We use several examples of each damage zone type to cover a range of structural complexities and as proxies for evolutionary stages of damage zone development during fault growth. The term structural complexity refers to the fracture abundance and range of orientations exhibited in a damage zone. We use the terms simple and complex as relative descriptions of the structural complexity of each damage zone, with complex indicating greater fracture abundances often displaying a wider range of orientations.\n\n\n3\nGeological setting\nThe Maltese Islands (Malta, Gozo, and Comino; Fig. 1a) are situated on the Malta Platform, which forms the NNE shoulder of the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene Pantelleria Rift (Reuther and Eisbacher, 1985; Dart et al., 1993; Jolivet and Faccenna, 2000). The archipelago is dominated by an ENE-WSW trending horst and graben system, comprising of the North Gozo and North Malta grabens (Dart et al., 1993; Putz-Perrier and Sanderson, 2010), that was activated during the Miocene before reaching a peak in activity during the Pliocene-Quaternary (Illies, 1981; Bosence and Pedley, 1982; Finetti, 1984; Jongsma et al., 1985). Major and minor extensional faults on the islands generally follow the trend of the horst and graben system with the exception of the ESE-WNW trending Il Maghlaq Fault (IMF; Fig. 1a), located on the southern coast of Malta, which has a similar trend to the Pantelleria Rift (Pedley et al., 1976; Illies, 1981; Reuther and Eisbacher, 1985; Bonson et al., 2007; Rotevatn et al., 2016). The Victoria Lines Fault (VLF) is a large graben-bounding fault (up to 195\u00a0m displacement) that separates the North Malta Graben from the Malta Horst to the south (Fig. 1a). The small extensional faults (<10\u00a0m displacement) that form the basis of this study are located at Ras ir Raheb, about 500\u20131000\u00a0m into the footwall of the VLF on the Malta Horst (Dart et al., 1993; Putz-Perrier and Sanderson, 2010; Michie et al., 2014; Dimmen et al., 2017). These small extensional faults may be considered as part of a >2\u00a0km wide footwall damage zone associated with the VLF, which includes several large splay faults distributing the displacement of the VLF (Putz-Perrier and Sanderson, 2010, Fig. 1a).\nThe islands comprise a sequence of Oligocene and Miocene carbonates that have a well-defined stratigraphy (Pedley et al., 1976; Dart et al., 1993). Along the coast at Ras ir Raheb (Fig. 1b), the stratigraphy can be divided into the Oligocene platform carbonates of the Lower Coralline Limestone Formation (LCLF) and the Miocene pelagic carbonates of the Globigerina Limestone Formation (Dart et al., 1993), which provide excellent outcrops for detailed studies of damage zones of small-scale extensional faults (e.g. Putz-Perrier and Sanderson, 2010; Dimmen et al., 2017). The Globigerina Limestone Formation can be divided into the Lower Globigerina Limestone Member (LGLM) and the Middle Globigerina Limestone Member (MGLM). The LGLM consists of fossiliferous packstones and wackestones and is marked at the top by a 50\u00a0cm thick phosphoritic conglomerate with an abundance of bivalve-, bryozoan-, solitary coral-, and echinoid-fossils (Pedley, 1987). The MGLM consists of highly bioturbated mudstones interbedded with thin layers (50\u2013100\u00a0cm thick) of phosphoritc conglomerate (Pedley et al., 1976; Bennett, 1979). The studied fault damage zones described in this study include relay- and tip-damage zones observed in plan-view on pavement outcrops of the MGLM and splay-damage zones observed in cross-section in cliff outcrops of both the LGLM and MGLM (Fig. 1b).\n\n\n4\nMethodology\n\n4.1\nMapping of damage zones\nField outcrops of 6 tip-damage zones, 9 relay-damage zones and 3 splay-damage zones were identified and documented in detail along sub-horizontal pavements and cliffs of the Globigerina Limestone Formation at Ras ir Raheb (N\u00e6rland, 2016) (Fig. 1b). All fault damage zones were photographed, mapped and structurally characterised allowing them to be classified depending on their structural complexity. Structural data were collected for faults exposed along the coast, including fault plane orientations and measured fault displacements. The high-resolution outcrop images were then merged, imported and georeferenced in ArcGIS where the fracture networks associated with each fault damage zone were then digitised for further geospatial and topological analysis (e.g. Nyberg et al., 2018).\n\n\n4.2\nNetwork topology and assessing connectivity\nA topological analysis was applied to each digitised fault damage zone in order to characterise the networks within them and to constrain their connectivity. In topology, each two-dimensional fracture network is considered as a planar graph consisting of nodes and branches between nodes (Manzocchi, 2002; Sanderson and Nixon, 2015; Sanderson et al., 2019). Based on the relationships between the fractures we can identify 3 types of node: I-nodes representing the tip of a fracture; Y-nodes representing the point of splaying or abutting fractures; and X-nodes representing the intersection point between two crossing fractures. Therefore, Y- and X-nodes are connecting nodes whereas I-nodes are isolated (Fig. 3\na). As branches have one node at each end they can be classified into three types, based on whether the nodes are connecting (C) or isolated (I): isolated branches (II), singly connected branches (IC) and doubly connected branches (CC) (Sanderson and Nixon, 2015) (Fig. 3a). The number counts of each node type (N\n\nI\n\n, N\n\nY\n\n, N\n\nX\n) and branch type (B\n\nII\n\n,\nB\n\nIC\n\n,\nB\n\nCC\n) can be used to plot their proportions on ternary diagrams, topologically characterising the fracture networks. The number of branches (B) and number of nodes (N) are related to each other by:\n\n(1)\n\nB = (N\n\nI\n\n+\u00a03N\n\nY\n\n+\u00a04N\n\nX\n\n) \/ 2\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that when sampling topological elements, that branches extending beyond the sample area are counted as half-branches in this relationship as only one end node is visible.\nWhere a network plots in a ternary diagram is representative of the network's connectivity. Isolated and poorly connected networks will plot towards the I-node and II-branch corners of each ternary diagrams, whereas well connected networks will plot towards the Y-X axis and CC corner (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the number counts of the different node types can be used to calculate parameters that directly describe the degree of connectivity within a network such as connections\nper\nbranch (C\n\nB\n), which describes the degree of connectivity between branches:\n\n(2)\n\nC\n\nB\n\n= (3N\n\nY\n\n+\u00a04N\n\nX\n\n) \/ B\n\n\n\n\nAs branches only have two nodes associated with them (i.e. I or C) values of C\n\nB\n range from 0 to 2 and can also be contoured onto both the node and branch ternary diagrams (Fig. 3) (Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018).\nAnother parameter is the average degree (<D>), which describes the degree to which nodes are connected to branches (Sanderson et al., 2019). It is defined by the ratio between the number of branches (B) and the number of nodes (N), whereby:\n\n(3)\n\nB \/ N\u00a0=\u00a0<D> \/ 2\n\n\n\n\nThus <D> provides an important link between the nodes and branches of the network. Within a fracture network an I-node has a degree of 1, a Y-node has a degree of 3 and an X-node has a degree of 4. Thus the average degree will vary from <D> = 1 (for poorly connected networks dominated by I-nodes and isolated branches) to <D> = 4 (for a completely connected network dominated by crossing fractures forming only X-nodes and CC-branches) (Fig. 3). Many natural fracture networks, particularly joint systems and fault networks, are often dominated by abutting relationships and Y-nodes (e.g. Nixon et al., 2012; Morley and Nixon, 2016; Duffy et al., 2017) and expected values of <D> will likely lie between 1 and 3.\n\n\n4.3\nEuler's theorem, regions and components\nIn graph theory the arrangement of the different nodes and branches within each fracture network forms a planar graph (Sanderson et al., 2019). As well as nodes and branches each planar graph contains components and regions bounded by cycles (Fig. 3b). The simplest component is an isolated branch (i.e. components iii and iv in Fig. 3b) but numerous connected nodes and branches will produce a connected component (i.e. components i and ii in Fig. 3b). Connected components represent clusters of fractures and can form anything from finite tree-like clusters to infinite networks. Regions, on the other hand, are the enclosed spaces within connected components representing the blocks of rock between fractures (Sanderson et al., 2019).\n\nEquation (3)\n shows that the number of branches (B) and number of nodes (N) can be linked to one another through the average degree (<D>). However, they can also be related to the number of components (K) and number of regions (R) through a generalisation of Euler's theorem (Euler, 1758; Sanderson et al., 2019), where by:\n\n(4)\n\nR\u00a0=\u00a0B \u2013 N\u00a0+\u00a0K\n\n\n\n\nThis indicates specific relationships between the different metrics (R, B, N and K) for a given network. In this paper we focus on comparing these different graph metrics to identify any relationships that could be useful for further classifying or describing the damage zones.\nIn addition, equation (4)\n is useful for extracting further metrics about a network. In particular, it can be used to extract the number of regions (or blocks between fractures) within each fracture network, simply calculated from the number of nodes, branches and connected components. If the area (A) of the extent of the sampled fracture network is known then we can also calculate an average block area (A\/R) for the network (Sanderson et al., 2019). Furthermore, dividing the average block area by the total sample area will give the dimensionless block intensity (R\n\n22\n), which can be simplified to:\n\n(5a)\n\nR\n\n22\n\n=\u00a0A\n\n\u22121\n\n. (A \/ R)\u00a0=\u00a01 \/ R\n\n\n\n\nAs R represents the number of enclosed regions, we can modify Equation (5a)\n to include an external infinite region representing the surrounding rock mass:\n\n(5b)\n\nR\n\n22\n\n=\u00a01 \/ (R\u00a0+\u00a01)\n\n\n\n\nThus, from equation (5b)\n, values for R\n\n22\n will range from 0 to 1, with 1 representing an intact rock mass that becomes more broken up as R\n\n22\n tends to 0. Therefore, as well as characterising the topology and connectivity of each damage zone we can also constrain how broken up the rock mass is within each damage zone, hence, quantifying the amount of damage. It is worth noting that this measure is highly influenced by the observed extent of a network and thus should only be used when comparing entire networks or sample areas of the same size.\n\n\n4.4\nSampling and assessing spatial variability\nAs well as collecting geometric and topological data for the damage zone as a whole, we also subsampled each damage zone to assess spatial variability. Circle samples that eliminate orientation bias (Mauldon et al., 2001; Sanderson and Nixon, 2015) were used to subsample along-strike and dip of the main faults associated with each damage zone. Within each circle sample the area, total trace-length, and the number of different topological elements (nodes, branches, components and regions) were recorded.\nThe sampling of nodes is straight forward as you simply count the number of nodes that lie within each circle sample (Fig. 3a). However, a branch may go beyond the boundary of a sample area, which means that: a) the length of such a branch is unknown or censored; and b) only one node associated with the branch lies within the sample area. Such branches can only be counted as half-branches. If topological information for the surrounding network is known, then the topology of the half-branch can still be determined. However, if this information is unknown then the topology of the branch cannot be determined and is classified as unknown. If a branch passes through a circle sample area then its associated nodes do not lie within the sample, thus the branch is not included in the branch count. This approach ensures that the branch count is consistent with the number of branches (B) calculated from the node count in equation 1. When calculating the number of regions (R) for each circle sample, using equation 4, we assume that the network is part of one connected component (after excluding isolated branches) as the components may be connected outside the sample area. Thus R = B \u2013 N + 1, resulting in a minimum value for the number of regions within each circle. Furthermore, a consequence of counting half-branches is that the value of R will include complete regions, within the circle sample, as well as half-regions which leave the sample area (Sanderson et al., 2019).\nThe recorded circle sample data were used to calculate subsequent along-strike\/along-dip profiles of different parameters including: i) fracture intensity, defined as total fracture trace-length per unit area (m\n\n\u22121\n or m\/m\n\n2\n); ii) connecting node frequency, defined as the number of connections per unit area (N\n\nC\n\n\/m\n\n2\n); and iii) the dimensionless block intensity (R\n\n22\n). In addition, contour plots of fracture intensity and connecting node frequency are used to illustrate variations within each damage zone.\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nStructural description of the damage zones\nAll of the studied damage zones are associated with normal faults, with less than 1.5\u00a0m of displacement, and consist of smaller faults (displacements up to a few cm) and opening-mode fractures. The faults generally have steep dips (up to 85\u00b0) and form a bimodal fault population with conjugate sets trending NNE-WSW and ESE-WNW (Fig. 1b). The examples of each type of fault damage zone (tip-, relay-, splay-) show varying degrees of structural complexity and can be further classified based on their structural style (Figs. 4\u20136\n\n\n).\nWe identify three different tip-damage zones with the simplest en echelon tips comprising overlapping and stepping fractures (e.g. Fig. 4a and b). More structurally complex tips include horsetail tips (e.g. Fig. 4c and f) that form several obliquely splaying fractures along-strike of the fault tip, and bifurcating tips (e.g. Fig. 4d and e) that include numerous splaying and intersecting fault strands and fractures. Local fracture intensities range spatially from 10\u00a0m\u22121 to 120\u00a0m\u22121 with the more complex tip damage zones exhibiting the highest intensities, often located at splays or areas of intense bifurcation, whereas the simplest tip damage zones only exhibit intensities <80\u00a0m\u22121 (e.g. Fig. 4a\u2013c).\nThe relay-damage zones are divided into intact relays, singly-breached relays and multiply-breached relays (Fig. 5). Intact relays comprise overlapping fault segments that may be interacting but have no physical linkage between the segments across the entire relay ramp. In the singly-breached relays, the fault segments are overlapping and interacting with a single linking fault\/fracture crossing the relay ramp between the two segments. Multiply-breached relays are where the two fault segments are linked by two or more faults\/fractures, thus breaking up the relay ramp creating a more complex damage zone. Local fracture intensities range spatially from 10\u00a0m\u22121 to 200\u00a0m\u22121 with the intact relay damage zones exhibiting the lowest intensities of <80\u00a0m\u22121 and the singly-breached relays containing intensities up to 100\u00a0m\u22121 (Fig. 5d and e). The highest intensity values are exhibited by the more complex multiply-breached relays (Fig. 5f\u2013i), with greatest intensities restricted to linkage areas where faults\/fractures are either splaying from or abutting the main fault segments.\nSplay-damage zones can range in complexity from a main fault with one or two synthetic splay faults (Fig. 6a and b) to a main fault with several synthetic splay faults interconnected by numerous antithetic faults\/fractures (Fig. 6c). The examples in this study show local fracture intensities ranging from 10 to 180\u00a0m\u22121, with K16 being the least structurally complex and exhibiting the lowest fracture intensities. In general local fracture intensities are less than 100\u00a0m\u22121, however, much higher values are observed at lenses and around splay intersections as shown for examples K3 and K8 (Fig. 6).\n\n\n5.2\nDamage zone topology and connectivity\nIn the next sections, we will explore the topology and graph metrics of the three main types of fault damage zone (tip-, relay- and splay-). The triangular plots in Fig. 7\n, along with Table 1\n, illustrate the proportions of the different node and branch types of each studied damage zone. The damage zones are mostly dominated by I- or Y-nodes, but show a broad variation plotting close to the I\u2013Y axis. Furthermore, almost all the damage zones are dominated by IC- or CC-branches, so plotting close to the IC-CC axis of the branch triangle.\nThe fault tip-damage zones (Fig. 4) plot closer to the I-node corner of the node triangle than relay- and splay-damage zones (Fig. 7a). Example K13, an en echelon tip, exhibits the greatest proportion of I-nodes at ~95% and is one of three tip-damage zones with no X-nodes (i.e. K13, K12, K18; Fig. 7a and Table 1). Whereas example K5, a horsetail tip, has the highest proportion of Y-nodes (~55%) and X-nodes (~3%) of all six fault tip-damage zones (Fig. 7a and Table 1). The branch triangle shows that most of the fault tip-damage zones plot along the IC-CC axis with low proportions of II-branches, between 4% and 8% (Fig. 7b and Table 1). The en echelon tip, K13, is the only fault damage zone dominated by II-branches with a proportion of >70%, thus plotting in the II-branch corner of the triangle. The en echelon tips produce the most isolated branches and nodes due to their unlinked and stepping fracture arrays. The nature of the bifurcating and horsetail tips, with numerous splaying and branching fractures, mean they have greater potential for creating Y-nodes and IC- or CC-branches.\nThe relay-damage zones (Fig. 5) plot closer to the Y-node corner of the triangle than both tip- and splay-damage zones (Fig. 7c). However, the examples show a large spread in node topology with examples K17 and K21, both intact relays, dominated by I-nodes with proportions of 57% and 67%, respectively. In contrast, the singly- (K11, K14) and multiply-breached relays (K1, K7, K19, K20) are all dominated by Y-nodes, with the latter showing the greatest proportion of connecting nodes (>80% Y- and X-nodes; Fig. 7c and Table 1) than any of the studied damage zones. Note that the multiply-breached relays also have greater proportions of X-nodes (between 8% and 11%) than any other damage zones. The relay-damage zones are dominated by IC- and CC-branches, with proportions of II-branches at <10%. The intact relays (K10, K17, K21; Fig. 7d and Table 1) exhibit more IC-branches (>30%) than the other relay-damage zones, with multiply-breached relays exhibiting up to 91% CC-branches, which is much greater than the other types of damage zone. The results indicate a progressive increase in both the proportion of connecting nodes (Y- and X-nodes) and CC-branches from intact relays to singly-breached relays to multiply-breached relays. These differences are a result of differences in their structural style with intact relays displaying more bifurcating fractures producing more IC-branches. Whereas the singly- and multiply-breached relays produce linking fractures between the two fault segments thus creating more CC-branches and less I-nodes.\nSplay-damage zones are clustered in both the node and the branch plots, reflecting a low variability in topology (Fig. 7e and f). They generally have topologies more similar to the relay-damage zones than the tip-damage zones (Fig. 7). The node plot shows that the splay-damage zones have large proportions of connecting nodes, ranging from ~60% to ~74% (Table 1). There are also very few II-branches (<6%) within the splay-damage zones with the largest proportion of their branches being fully connected CC-branches (>70%; Fig. 7f and Table 1).\nThe differences in topology between the three types of fault damage zone are reflected in the number of connections per branch (C\n\nB\n; Fig. 8\n and Table 1), with tip-damage zones having the lowest range of C\n\nB\n (0.52\u20131.62), with en echelon tips forming the least connected fracture networks (C\n\nB\n\u00a0<\u00a01.30; Fig. 8). Horsetail and bifurcating tips produce better connected tip-damage zones with values of C\n\nB\n\u00a0>\u00a01.40. In the relay-damage zones C\n\nB\n increases from less connected intact relays to very connected multiply-breached relays (Fig. 8). Intact relays display a similar range of C\n\nB\n to the tip-damage zones as they comprise two overlapping but soft linked fault tips. In contrast, multiply-breached relays are the most connected damage zone examples with values of C\n\nB\n\u00a0>\u00a01.85, which can be expected from hard linked fault segments. Splay-damage zones also produce well connected fracture networks with values of C\n\nB\n\u00a0>\u00a01.60, similar to singly-breached relays (Fig. 8).\n\n\n5.3\nGraph metrics\nThe plots in Fig. 9\n compare various graph metrics (i.e. number of nodes, branches, regions and compartments; Table 1) of the different damage zone fracture networks. Fig. 9a and b compare the number of branches (B) to the number of regions (R) and components (K), respectively. These metrics are normalised to the total number of nodes (N), which accounts for different sizes of network (i.e. larger networks produce greater numbers of nodes). Furthermore, this produces the parameter B\/N (number of branches per node or branch to node ratio) on the y-axis, which is the equivalent of <D>\/2, thus linking to the degree of connectivity. The plots indicate clear relationships where an increase in the branch to node ratio (B\/N) results in an increase in the number of regions (Fig. 9a) and a decrease in the number of components (Fig. 9b). The combined effect of these relationships means that the number of regions per component (R\/K) within each damage zone increases with the ratio of branches to nodes (B\/N) (Fig. 9c). This increase in the regions per component does not begin until the fracture networks reach a branch to node ratio of 0.9 (Fig. 9c), equivalent to an average degree (<D>) of 1.8, as no regions form below this degree of connectivity (Fig. 9a).\nThe tip-damage zones form fracture networks with low numbers of regions (Fig. 9a) but have high numbers of components (Fig. 9b). This is particularly the case for en echelon tips which form no regions (Fig. 9a) but have large proportions of isolated (II) and singly connected (IC) branches (e.g. Figs. 4 and 7b). As a result, they produce the lowest branch to node ratios (B\/N\u00a0<\u00a00.9). The relay-damage zones show a large spread in graph metrics with intact relays overlapping with tip-damage zones, so producing less regions but more components in comparison to the singly-breached and multiply-breached relays (Fig. 9a and b). The multiply-breached relays produce the most number of regions and least number of components of all the studied damage zones, resulting in the highest number of regions per component (Fig. 9c). Splay-damage zones show the least spread in graph metrics with relatively moderate numbers of regions and low numbers of components (Fig. 9a and b), thus displaying similar characteristics to the singly- and multiply-breached relays.\nOverall there appears to be a trend where, relative to the size of their networks, the more structurally complex damage zones (i.e. singly- and multiply-breached relays) produce more regions per component than for simple damage zones (i.e. en echelon tips and intact relays). This relationship is reflected in Fig. 9d, which illustrates influence of the degree of connectivity, with the dimensionless block intensity (R\n\n22\n) tending to 1 as the average degree (<D>) decreases towards 1.8. This suggests simple en echelon tips leave the rock mass relatively intact (R\n\n22\n\u00a0=\u00a01), as they produce no blocks, whereas the more complex multiply-breached relays break it into many blocks (R\n\n22\n \u226a 1). The fracture networks of splay-damage zones show the lowest values of R\n\n22\n (<0.01), suggesting they produce the most amount of damage in comparison to the other damage zones.\n\n\n5.4\nSpatial variations in topology and damage\nOne example of each type of damage zone (tip-, relay-, splay-) is selected for full presentation to explore the spatial distribution of different topological parameters and fracture abundances. Specifically, we use contour maps in combination with circle samples (CS) that record along-strike\/along-dip profiles in fracture intensity, connecting node frequency, average degree (<D>) and the dimensionless block intensity (R\n\n22\n) (Figs. 10\u201312\n\n\n). We focus on describing the locations of structurally complex areas, with high fracture intensities and a range of fracture orientations, within each type of damage zone and their relationship with topological and graph measures.\n\n5.4.1\nFault tip damage zone: example K5\nExample K5 is a small (max. throw: 1\u00a0cm) NNW-dipping normal fault exposed in a pavement outcrop within the MGLM (Fig. 1b). The normal fault tip comprises two main fault segments, that are soft linked, and splays into a set of WNW-trending wing-cracks (Fig. 10a). The fracture intensity map (Fig. 10b) shows values mostly below 20\u00a0m\u22121, with bullseyes of higher values restricted to bifurcation points (e.g. CS5, CS7 and CS8; Fig. 10a) or areas of lensing (e.g. CS9 to CS10; Fig. 10a) within the main part of the tip-damage zone. Bullseyes in the connecting node frequency map are also restricted to areas of bifurcation and lensing (Fig. 10c). This relationship is reflected on along-strike profiles of fracture intensity (Fig. 10d) and connecting node frequency (Fig. 10e) with corresponding peaks at CS5, CS7 and CS10.\nValues of R\n\n22\n are >0.1, indicating a low to moderate amount of damage, but show a clear inverse relationship to connecting node frequency and fracture intensity with lows at CS5, CS7 and CS10. This indicates that these areas of bifurcation and lensing within the damage zone are sites of increased damage where high fracture abundances and numbers of connections break the rock mass into numerous blocks. Values for <D> vary from 1 to 3, forming a broadly undulating but consistent profile with a decrease towards end of the tip zone from CS4 to CS1. They do not appear to correlate directly with the other profiled measures suggesting that the degree of connectivity is spatially less variable and not directly related to local increases in fracture intensity and connecting node frequency.\n\n\n5.4.2\nRelay damage zone: example K7\nExample K7 is a small (max. throw: 8\u00a0cm) multiply-breached relay, exposed in a pavement outcrop within the MGLM (Fig. 1b), between two right-stepping ENE-trending normal faults that dip towards NNW. Within the relay-damage zone, a wide range of fracture orientations are observed with ~NW-trending faults\/fractures breaching across the relay (Fig. 11a). Fracture intensities are generally less than 50\u00a0m\u22121 along the relay bounding faults with minor bullseyes and peaks associated with lensing (i.e. CS3, CS5 and CS6; Fig. 11b and d). The highest intensity values (>50\u00a0m\u22121) are observed along the relay breach with bullseyes where breaching fractures splay from or abut the ENE-trending relay bounding faults (i.e. CS8 to CS9 and CS11 to CS12; Fig. 11b and d). The highest connecting frequencies (>2000 N\n\nc\n\n\/m\n\n2\n) also occur along the relay breach (i.e. CS8-CS12), with a major bullseye and maximum profile peak in sample CS11 where breaching fractures splay and abut the southern relay bounding fault (Fig. 11c and e). Minor bullseyes and peaks in connecting node frequency also occur in areas of lensing along the relay bounding faults (i.e. CS3 and CS6).\nThe R\n\n22\n values in example K7 again show an inverse relationship with intensity and connecting node frequency and are considerably lower on average (<0.1) than example K5, indicating a moderate to high level of damage. The increased fracture abundance along with higher numbers of intersections in the breached area produce the lowest R\n\n22\n values, tending towards 0.01 (Fig. 11g). Unlike the other parameters the average degree (<D>) is relatively constant along-strike of the damage zone, ranging from ~2.5 to ~3 (Fig. 11f). Slightly higher values of <D> coincide with areas of lensing along the relay bounding faults and the breached relay area, matching patterns in fracture intensity and connecting node frequency.\n\n\n5.4.3\nSplay fault damage zone: example K3\nExample K3 is a NNW-dipping normal fault observed in a cliff section offsetting the LGLM and MGLM with a maximum throw of ~40\u00a0cm (Fig. 1b). The fault is planar in the MGLM, with a dip of ~60\u00b0, whereas in the LGLM the fault has a more listric character (Fig. 12a). Within the LGLM fracturing around the fault is dominated by long layer-parallel fractures, whereas within the MGLM there are numerous steeply dipping antithetic and synthetic faults\/fractures. Key features include a lens stretching in and above a phosphoritic conglomerate at the top of the LGLM and a footwall splay zone located in the upper part of the outcrop within the MGLM (Fig. 12a).\nWithin the LGLM (CS1 to CS16) the splay damage zone shows relatively low fracture intensities (<50\u00a0m\n\n\u22121\n; Fig. 12b and d) and connecting node frequencies (<1000 N\n\nc\n\n\/m\n\n2\n; Fig. 12c and e). Furthermore, along this interval R\n\n22\n values undulate around an average of ~0.3, a relatively low amount of damage. The transition from the LGLM through the phosphoritic conglomerate to the MGLM (CS17 to CS21) shows an increase in both fracture intensity and connecting node frequency, with peaks at CS20 immediately above the conglomerate. This spatial pattern is mirrored by the R\n\n22\n profile, which decreases to values\u00a0<\u00a00.1 representing an increase in damage (Fig. 12g). Values of <D> are highly variable within the LGLM, ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 (Fig. 12f), which contrasts with the relatively low and stable profiles of fracture intensity and connecting node frequency. The high variability in connectivity within the LGLM could be related to the numerous layer-parallel fractures obliquely cross-cutting the main fault and its subsidiary faults and fractures.\nIn the MGLM, discrete bullseyes and peaks in both fracture intensity (Fig. 12b and d) and connecting node frequency (Fig. 12c and e) occur where the largest antithetic fault\/fracture intersects the main fault (CS22 to CS24). At this intersection point there is also a significant decrease in R\n\n22\n, which tends towards 0.01 (Fig. 12g), indicating a high amount of damage with the rock mass very broken up at this location. The highest fracture intensities and connecting node frequencies along K3 occur within the footwall splay zone (CS32 to CS37), where broad bullseyes and peaks occur immediately above the main splay bifurcation point (Fig. 12a\u2013e). The peaks in fracture intensity and the number of connections measured in these circle samples coincide with the lowest R\n\n22\n values (0.01; Fig. 12g), highlighting that these samples represent a highly damaged zone. Within the MGLM, highs in <D> broadly coincide with highs in fracture intensity and connecting node frequency as well as lows in R\n\n22\n. This shows that the degree of connectivity can be influenced spatially by large changes in the fracture abundance and the number of connections.\n\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nNew characteristics of damage zones from topology and graph metrics\nThe application of topology and graph metrics to damage zones adds information to their characterisation based on the underlying relationships between the fractures within their fracture networks. The node and branch topological model (Figs. 3a and 13\na) describes the different types of connections between the fractures and how fracture traces are connected to others within the network (Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018). In addition, graph metrics provide a generalisation of the constitutive elements (nodes, branches, regions and components) that make-up each fracture network (Figs. 3b and 13b; Sanderson et al., 2019) and how those elements relate to one another. Thus, these two approaches provide a means to classify networks based on their arrangement and connectivity, complementing traditional studies that focus on describing their architecture and geometry (e.g. McGrath and Davison, 1995; Kim et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2016; Peacock et al., 2017). Our results indicate that different types of damage zone are characterised by distinct topological signatures and graph metrics, with differences and similarities between each type (as summarised by Fig. 13):\n\n\u2022\n\nTip-damage zones (Positions A-C) \u2013 En echelon tips have simple networks consisting of numerous isolated fractures, thus they plot between positions A and B on Fig. 13 as unconnected fracture networks (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0<\u00a01.3; Fig. 8) with high proportions of I-nodes and II-branches (Fig. 7). These networks comprise numerous components with very low branch to node ratios (B\/N\u00a0<\u00a01) and no regions (Fig. 9). At position B, complex tip-damage zones (e.g. horsetail tips, bifurcating tips) form, producing more connected fracture networks (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0=\u00a01.3\u20131.6; Fig. 8) with increased proportions of Y-nodes and high proportions of IC-branches (Fig. 7). These networks begin to form numerous small tree-like components with low branch to node ratios (B\/N =\u00a01) and very few regions (Fig. 9).\n\n\n\u2022\n\nRelay-damage zones (Positions B-D) \u2013 Intact relays consist of two overlapping fault tips that are approach one another but do not link, resulting in characteristics similar to tip-damage zones, generally plotting between positions B and C on Fig. 13. Singly-breach relays plot close to C, forming complex and moderately connected networks (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0>\u00a01.6; Fig. 8) with greater proportions of Y-nodes and CC-branches (Fig. 7b). Thus, their networks produce large tree-like components with high branch to node ratios (B\/N up to ~1.3) and moderate numbers of regions (Fig. 9). Finally, multiply-breached relays tend to plot closer to D, representing well-connected networks (with C\n\nB\n\u00a0>\u00a01.8; Fig. 8) dominated by Y-nodes and high proportions of CC-branches. These consist of a few large interconnected components with very high branch:node ratios (B\/N\u00a0>\u00a01.3) and high numbers of regions (Fig. 9).\n\n\n\u2022\n\nSplay-damage zones (Positions C-D) \u2013 Although these fault damage zones are observed in cross-section they show similar characteristics to singly- and multiply-breached relays, plotting between positions C and D on Fig. 13. The fracture networks display a moderate degree of connectivity (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0>\u00a01.6; Fig. 8), due to high proportions of Y-nodes and CC-branches (Fig. 7). They also produce large tree-like components with high branch to node ratios, the same as singly-breached relays, but generally have fewer components with more regions (i.e. Fig. 9).\n\n\n\nThe topological characteristics and graph metrics of the studied damage zones indicate a clear link to their structural style and complexity (i.e. high fracture abundances, range of orientations), with tip-damage zones forming the simplest networks and relay-damage zones forming the most complex. Tip-damage zones accommodate decreases in displacement at fault tips and are generated by stress concentrations, which are enhanced by larger displacement gradients (e.g. Cowie and Scholz, 1992; Cowie and Shipton, 1998; Shipton and Cowie, 2003). However, relay-damage zones involve the interacting stress fields of two fault tips, which inhibits tip propagation and increases displacement gradients as well as causes local rotations in the stress field between the two faults (c.f. Willemse et al., 1996; Crider and Pollard, 1998; Gupta and Scholz, 2000; Kattenhorn et al., 2000). Thus, the resultant damage zones will exhibit greater fracture intensities and varied fracture orientations in comparison to isolated fault tip-damage zones (e.g. Peacock and Sanderson, 1994; Bastesen and Rotevatn, 2012; Fossen and Rotevatn, 2016). Such increases in fracture intensity and variations in fracture orientation will increase connectivity (e.g. Sanderson and Nixon, 2018). Thus, more structurally complex damage zones are generally better connected, with greater proportions of connecting nodes and CC-branches that form larger components with more regions. Similar relationships between structural complexity and topological character have been described for rift fault networks, where complex multiphase rifts form more connected networks with higher proportions of Y-nodes and CC-branches in comparison to simple single-phase rifts (Morley and Nixon, 2016; Duffy et al., 2017).\nOverall these topological and graph characteristics provide new quantitative descriptions of network arrangement and connectivity, allowing a more meaningful comparison of the different damage zone types. An additional advantage of using topology and graph theory is that they are dimensionless and therefore the topology of damage zones and their fracture networks can be used and compared on a range of scales. Furthermore, the distinct topologies and trends in their graph metrics make it possible to predict the properties of the different damage zones. This can be useful when estimating deformation around fault tips and fault linkage in the subsurface, where small-scale structures in damage zones are not easily observed due to data resolution limitations (e.g. seismic reflection data; Enge et al., 2007) Thus this can have implications when assessing fluid-flow conduits and barriers (e.g. Leveille et al., 1997), the integrity of structural traps (e.g. Gartrell et al., 2006) and the structural configuration and compartmentalization of reservoirs in large-scale fault tips and relay damage zones (e.g. Pickering et al., 1997; Rotevatn et al., 2009; Rotevatn and Fossen, 2011; Richards et al., 2015).\n\n\n6.2\nDamage zone development and topological pathways\nWhen faults grow they propagate, interact and accumulate slip to increase in both length and displacement, allowing them to accommodate greater strains and become more linked (e.g. Cowie and Scholz, 1992; Peacock and Sanderson, 1994; Cartwright et al., 1995; Cowie et al., 2000; Walsh et al., 2001; Childs et al., 2003; Bull et al., 2006; Duffy et al., 2017; Rotevatn et al., 2019). During these processes of fault evolution, damage zones will generally increase in size and become more complex (Shipton and Cowie, 2001, 2003; e.g. Kim et al., 2003; Fossen et al., 2005; Childs et al., 2009; Bastesen and Rotevatn, 2012). For example, slip accumulation on a fault will enhance stress concentrations at the fault tip, producing a wider and more intense tip-damage zone (c.f. Shipton and Cowie, 2003). Furthermore, if the fault tip propagates and interacts with another fault then the tip-damage zone will evolve into a relay-damage zone, adding more damage structures to or overprinting the existing damage zone (Kim et al., 2003, 2004).\nThe variety of structural styles and complexities of the tip- and relay-damage zones observed in the study area illustrate this spectrum of damage zone development, as presented in the evolutionary model shown in Fig. 13c (i.e. A-D). Firstly, we infer that en echelon tips (A) might evolve into more complex horsetail and bifurcating tips (B) with increased slip and tip propagation, similar to the tip-damage zone evolution suggested by Kim et al. (2003) for strike-slip faults. Secondly, the three types of relay-damage zone clearly represent different stages of fault linkage (e.g. Peacock and Sanderson, 1991, 1994; Walsh and Watterson, 1991; Huggins et al., 1995; Childs et al., 2009; Bastesen and Rotevatn, 2012; Fossen and Rotevatn, 2016), with intact relays (B) expected to evolve into singly-breached relays (C) and finally multiply-breached relays (D) as the faults progressively interact and link. Using this evolutionary model, we discuss how the topology and graph characteristics of the damage zones might develop and how their arrangement and connectivity potentially evolves.\nThe topological and graph characteristics of the tip- and relay-damage zones (Figs. 7 and 9) indicate that they evolve along well-constrained topological pathways, as illustrated by the red arrows between positions A and D on Fig. 13a and b. The tip-damage zones only evolve part way along these pathways, initially dominated by I-nodes and II-branches before forming more Y-nodes and IC-branches and eventually CC-branches (Fig. 13a). This represents fractures splaying and bifurcating as horsetail\/bifurcating tip-damage zones develop. The node to branch ratios of the damage zones increase (particularly between positions A and B) as components increase in size and begin to link to form trees. After position B the components are connected enough to start forming regions (Fig. 13b).\nRelay-damage zones evolve further along the topological pathways, becoming dominated by Y-nodes and CC-branches (Fig. 13b; positions B-D) as across-fault fractures develop within the relay and abut\/cross-cut each other. Once the relays start to breach at position C, the number of components decreases as the two tip-damage zones of the interacting faults link to form larger interconnected networks. The number of regions per component substantially increases as more and more regions form within these interconnected damage zones.\nThese topological pathways provide important insights into how networks develop in damage zones during fault evolution. The node and branch topologies evolve along similar pathways predicted for rift fault networks as shown by Duffy et al. (2017). They apply node and branch topology to physical clay analogue models, showing how topology changes in fault networks with increasing finite strain. Their results are compared with natural examples of rift fault networks and also highlight the importance of across-strike faulting in reaching more evolved topologies. The similarities between the damage zone fracture networks and rift fault networks suggest that the pathways highlighted in this study could be more widely applied to larger scale fault networks.\n\n\n6.3\nControls on spatial variability along fault damage zones\nAll the studied damage zones show spatial variability in their complexity along-strike\/dip. More simple zones consist of a fault segment and damage with low fracture intensities and connecting node frequencies, which leave the rock mass relatively intact. These separate more complex parts consist of higher fracture intensities and connecting node frequencies that break up the rock mass into numerous blocks. These complex zones are often located around irregularities along the faults\/fractures, such as bends that create lenses or intersections associated with bifurcations\/abutments. As faults accrue displacement, these irregularities can locally perturb or concentrate stress, enhancing the development of fractures within the damage zone (e.g. Segall and Pollard, 1980; Rawnsley et al., 1992; Willemse and Pollard, 1998; Maerten et al., 2002; Berg and Skar, 2005; Fossen et al., 2005; Childs et al., 2009).\nThe fault splay-damage zones also show variations in damage between the different limestone members observed in the study area. In the Lower Globergerina Limestone Member (LGLM) a simple damage zone is observed, whereas in the Middle Globergerina Limestone Member (MGLM) more complex zones develop around intersections with splay faults and numerous antithetic faults. Studies have shown how changes in the mechanical and compositional properties of limestones can affect fracturing and faulting (e.g. Wennberg et al., 2006; Ortega et al., 2010; Michie et al., 2014; Korneva et al., 2018). Ortega et al. (2010) and Korneva et al. (2018) highlight how the level of dolomitization can control fracture intensity, but the limestones in the study area do not appear dolomitized. Wennberg et al. (2006) and Michie et al. (2014) illustrate the influence of texture and grainsize on fracturing and fault zone development, respectively. Both indicate that more fine-grained mud-supported limestones are likely to develop more fractures and large fracture networks than more coarse-grained, grain-supported limestones. As the MGLM consists of mudstones and the LGLM is composed of packstones and wackestones (Pedley et al., 1976; Pedley, 1987), we suggest the difference in damage zone development is caused by contrasts in grain size and mud composition of the limestones. This highlights the importance of considering the lithology when considering the character of damage zones and fault related deformation.\nThe presence of structurally complex zones highlights that deformation is not evenly distributed within a damage zone. It has been shown that such zones of increased fracturing and complexity can accommodate greater strains within the damage zone and help maintain strain compatibility (Nixon et al., 2019). Furthermore, such zones of complexity can have an impact on the behaviour of fluids within a damage zone. If the fractures are open, then these zones of high fracture abundance can enhance and localise flow (e.g. Davatzes et al., 2003; Kim and Sanderson, 2010; Dimmen et al., 2017, 2020). The variety in fracture orientations and the increased number of intersections helps maintain flow pathways, due to a greater probability that fractures are optimally orientated to remain open in any given stress-field (Sanderson and Zhang, 2004). Thus, in tight carbonate rocks with low matrix permeability the structurally complex zones can represent highly-permeable conduits for fluid flow (e.g. Tamagawa and Pollard, 2008; Rotevatn and Bastesen, 2014).\n\n\n6.4\nInsights into the three-dimensional connectivity of faults tips and relay zones\nTraditionally many of the descriptions of fault tip- and relay-damage zones have been acquired from two-dimensional outcrop surfaces (e.g. McGrath and Davison, 1995; Kim et al., 2003; Peacock et al., 2017; Nixon et al., 2019; this study), and there have been less observations of their three-dimensional character. Multiple sections through a fracture network can be used for providing more representative measurements of the network in three-dimensions \u2013 for example, one could apply stereology and average results from the different sections (e.g. Sanderson et al., 2019). The splay-damage zones in this study represent cross sections through either a relay- or tip-damage zone, providing an opportunity to compare their plan-view and cross-sectional characteristics in topology and connectivity. In plan-view there is much variability in topology (i.e. Fig. 7) and connectivity (i.e. Fig. 8) of the different tip- (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0=\u00a0~0.5 to ~1.6) and relay-damage zones (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0=\u00a0~1.2 to ~1.9). In contrast, the splay-damage zones produce more consistent topologies and connectivity (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0=\u00a0~1.65 to ~1.8), despite variations in style and complexity (i.e. Figs. 7 and 8). This suggests that even if fractures are not well connected along-strike (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0<\u00a01.5; Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018), it is likely that they are connected along-dip in cross-section (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0>\u00a01.5; Sanderson and Nixon, 2015, 2018). This is due to the formation of both synthetic and antithetic fractures within the damage zones and their opposing dip directions (i.e. Fig. 6). In low-permeability carbonate rocks, where the fractures provide permeability, such variations in fracture connectivity increases the potential for anisotropy in the rocks permeability (e.g. Balberg and Binenbaum, 1983; Long and Witherspoon, 1985; Zhang and Sanderson, 1995) as it impacts the percolation threshold of the fracture network (e.g. Manzocchi, 2002; Saevik and Nixon, 2017; Sanderson and Nixon, 2018). For example, if the fractures act as fluid conduits then tip-damage zones are likely to have greater along-dip permeabilities due to their low along-strike (i.e. plan view) connectivity, whereas singly-breached and multiply-breached relays are likely to have a more isotropic permeability as the degree of connectivity is similar in both sections of observation.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nField-examples of different tip-, relay- and splay-damage zones, associated with small-scale normal faults in carbonate rocks from Malta, have been mapped in detail and analysed in terms of their geometry, topology and graph characteristics. This has allowed us to document and quantify the arrangement and connectivity of the damage zone fracture networks and how they vary spatially. In addition, placing the damage zones in the context of a fault evolutionary model has allowed us to explore the potential network development of fault damage zones. Key findings include:\n\n\u2022\nDifferent tip-, relay- and splay-damage zones show distinct topological and graph characteristics, which are closely related to the structural style and complexity of the damage zones.\n\n\n\u2022\nTip-damage zones produce the simplest networks with higher proportions of I-nodes and II-\/IC-branches, resulting in low to moderate degrees of connectivity (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0=\u00a0~0.5 to ~1.6). Their networks include many isolated and small tree-like components that have few regions.\n\n\n\u2022\nRelay- and splay-damage zones produce more complex networks with higher proportions of Y-nodes and CC-branches, with moderate to high degrees of connectivity (i.e. C\n\nB\n\u00a0=\u00a0~1.2 to ~1.9). Their networks include large tree-like or interconnected components with the potential to develop numerous regions.\n\n\n\u2022\nCombining information from plan-view (tip- and relay-damage zones) and cross-section (splay-damage zones) examples can provide a more representative pseudo 3-D evaluation of a damage zones topology and connectivity. Connectivity can vary considerably in plan-view but is more consistent in cross-section, which can be important for assessing permeability anisotropy.\n\n\n\u2022\nLocations of stress perturbations and concentrations (i.e. fault bends and fault intersection points) produce complex zones within each damage zone. These consist of higher fracture intensities and higher connecting node frequencies. Thus these complex zones exhibit greater amounts of damage, breaking the rock mass up into numerous blocks.\n\n\n\u2022\nAs faults propagate, interact and accumulate slip their damage zones evolve along well constrained topological pathways. Networks are initially dominated by I-nodes and II-branches and evolve towards networks dominated by Y-nodes and CC-branches. Thus damage zone connectivity increases substantially as more and more fractures form in the damage zone. The components within the network will grow and link, evolving from many tree-like components to a few large interconnected components. In addition, the regions per component significantly increases as more regions form and components link.\n\n\n\nThe application of topology and graph theory to these different damage zones provides new information that complements traditional characterisations based on descriptions of their geometry and architecture. Furthermore, the topological and graph characterisation provides an important link to the fluid-flow behaviour of the damage zones by quantifying the arrangement and connectivity of their fracture networks. The distinct characteristics of the different damage zones in this study could provide useful insights when assessing flow properties of identified damage zones in the subsurface.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nCasey W.

In faulted or fractured reservoirs, these structural features may be reactivated due to continued production, resulting in unpredictable or even unwanted fluid flow behaviour such as early water breakthrough or channelized fluid flow (Jolley et al., 2007; Toublanc et al., 2005). Additionally, closed and cemented fractures can lower the effective permeability, thereby potentially inhibiting fluid flow and potential production (e.g. Bisdom et al., 2016; Laubach et al., 2019).\nPredicting the geometry, location and intensity of natural fractures has become an integral component of characterizing structurally complex reservoirs. These characterization studies often consider a multitude of scales and data types (Freeman et al., 2015; Quinn et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2017). Seismic data is generally used to detect and characterize larger structural features such as faults ranging from tens to hundreds of meters (Boe, 2012; Bounaim et al., 2013; Toublanc et al., 2005). Image log - and\/or core data is commonly used to detect and describe smaller structural features ranging from few centimetres to several metres. The usage of either data set in isolation has limitations with respect to its resolution. Seismic data lack the fine scale interpretation at the well location, and log data lack the lateral distribution component. However, the combination of the low-resolution seismic data and the high-resolution well data reduces the uncertainty in mapping and predicting structural discontinuities (Gauthier et al., 2002; Laubach et al., 2019; Toublanc et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2017).\nThere are several published methods that allow for combining seismic and well log data with the aim to reduce prediction uncertainties. For instance, a methodology commonly used in subsurface case studies is geostatistical modelling (Gauthier et al., 2002). This method generally integrates the seismic \u2013 and borehole input data using 1) statistical distributions (e.g. fracture length or orientation), 2) large scale probability maps, and\/or 3) correlations between the different datasets, in order to create large scale representations of subsurface reservoirs (e.g. Gauthier et al., 2002; Toublanc et al., 2005).\nA more recent method involves the usage of linear elastic forward modelling of geologically constrained data sets, so that mechanically constrained descriptions of sub-seismic features can be realized on a reservoir scale (e.g. Boersma et al., 2019a,b; Maerten et al., 2006; Maerten et al., 2016\nMaerten et al., 2019). This approach integrates seismic and well data with geological concepts such as fault or fold-related fracturing and linear elastic fracture mechanics (Maerten et al., 2006, 2019). However, successful applications of this approach require extensive knowledge of the geological and tectonic history in order to make sound assumptions.\nSubsurface fracture prediction uncertainties can also be aided by outcrop analogues, which can provide valuable information on the relation between far-field stresses, local lithology, large-scale structural features (e.g. faults or folds) and local fracture-network geometries (Boersma et al., 2019a,b; Hanke et al., 2018; Maerten et al., 2016; McGinnis et al., 2015). While the importance of outcrop analogues is acknowledged, multiple studies have also shown and suggested that introducing fracture data generated under tectonic constraints different from the reservoir conditions, can introduce a considerable bias (e.g. Boro et al., 2014; Laubach et al., 2019; Sanderson, 2016; Williams et al., 2017).\nAnother method for characterizing naturally fractured reservoirs is to analyse attributes of high quality 3D seismic amplitude data (Bounaim et al., 2019; Jaglan and Qayyum, 2015; Williams et al., 2017). For example, edge detection attributes such as amplitude contrast or curvature can identify areas of significant changes in the seismic signal which might relate to fault zones and fracture corridors (e.g. Boe, 2012; Chopra and Marfurt, 2007; Jaglan and Qayyum, 2015). Additionally, applying edge enhancement filters allows for the automatic detection and extraction of large fault networks (Boe, 2012; Boersma et al., 2019a,b; Bounaim et al., 2013; Jaglan and Qayyum, 2015; Williams et al., 2017). Furthermore, a case study testing seismic attributes for fracture detection showed that even when being at the limit of the seismic resolution, subtle changes in the seismic signal caused by naturally fractured rock could be detected using normal-vector attributes (Bounaim et al., 2019; Haege et al., 2013). However, even though these attributes can detect fractured rock bodies, it should be noted that individual fractures interpreted from core - or image-log data fall below the resolution of the seismic attributes.\nIn this study, we expand the seismic reservoir characterization methodologies explained above and present a new workflow that integrates seismic fault and fracture detection with borehole image-log interpretation. This is done in order to create a 3D seismic discontinuity cube that is representative of the fault and fracture network present within the southern part of the Ekofisk Field offshore Norway, which is a large naturally fractured chalk reservoir (Fig. 1\n). This study is structured as follows: First, a set of newly developed seismic volume attributes and fault detection tools are presented and used to create the 3D seismic discontinuity cube. Second, small-scale structural features are interpreted and characterized using image log data from three different wells. Third, a qualitative correlation between the seismic and well data is established. Finally, the results are evaluated against 4D seismic changes caused by water injection and the implications and potential for future work are discussed.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and study area\n\n2.1\nTectonic setting and stratigraphy\nThe Ekofisk field is located in the southern part of the Norwegian Central Graben (NCG) which represents the southern branch of the North Sea triple rift system (Gennaro, 2011) (Fig. 1a). The present configuration of the NCG is the result of several subsequent tectonic events (Gennaro, 2011; Vejb\u00e6k and Andersen, 2002; Ziegler, 1990, 1992):\n\n1)\nWNW-ESE Permo-Triassic extension and the deposition of the Zechstein successions\n\n\n2)\nEarly Jurassic doming\n\n\n3)\nLate Jurassic rifting (WNW-ESE extension)\n\n\n4)\nEarly Cretaceous E-W compression (inversion) and transpressive movement along NW-SE Triassic-Jurassic faults\n\n\n5)\nLate Cretaceous to Eocene thermal subsidence accompanied by several NNE-SSW compressive pulses resulting in the inversion of major basement faults and salt movement\n\n\n6)\nContinued halokinesis and the development 4-way dip anticlines (domes)\n\n\n\nThe Ekofisk Chalk Field is a dome structure (Fig. 1a and b) comprising upper Cretaceous and lower Paleogene reworked chalk sediment of the Tor Formation, the Lower Ekofisk Formation and the Upper Ekofisk Formation (Gennaro et al., 2013). These formations are overlain and sealed by the silt and shale layers of the Paleogene Balder Formation, resulting in large entrapments of hydrocarbons.\n\n\n2.2\nField characteristics\nThe Ekofisk reservoir rocks exhibit relatively high porosities (\u00b130%) and comparatively low matrix permeabilities ranging between 0.1 and 10 mD (Gennaro et al., 2013; Tolstukhin et al., 2012; Toublanc et al., 2005). Also, as known from other chalk fields in the North Sea (e.g. Klinkby et al., 2005), a gas cap at the crest of the field produces a Seismically Obscured Area (SOA) within the centre of the dome and in younger stratigraphic layers (Fig. 1b). A vast network of connected faults and fractures exists in the chalk formations, which significantly enhances the effective permeability of the normally tight reservoir rocks (up to 50mD), thereby making commercial production possible (Agarwal et al., 1997; Teufel and Farrell, 1990; Toublanc et al., 2005).\nPrevious seismic interpretations point out that the Ekofisk fault network shows three main orientations (WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW) (Gennaro, 2011; Jones et al., 2014; Toublanc et al., 2005) (Fig. 1b). Fracture classification studies using core data indicate that the Ekofisk fracture network can be sub-divided into four main classes, namely: 1) Tectonic fractures, 2) stylolite-associated fractures, 3) irregular fractures and 4) healed fractures, with the tectonic fractures being most dominant and the main contributors to the effective permeability within the Ekofisk reservoir formations (Agarwal et al., 1997; Jones et al., 2014; Teufel and Farrell, 1990; Toublanc et al., 2005). The main orientations of these small-scale structural features are commonly sub-divided in three main sets which generally strike parallel to the orientations of the main fault groups (i.e. WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW) (Agarwal et al., 1997; Teufel and Farrell, 1990; Toublanc et al., 2005). This observation has led to the assumption that the Ekofisk faults and fractures are structurally related (Agarwal et al., 1997; Teufel and Farrell, 1990; Toublanc et al., 2005).\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nThe dataset\nThis study focuses on the southern part of the Ekofisk Chalk Field, outside of the SOA (Fig. 2\na). This part of the field was chosen, such that potential sources of knowable seismic noise (e.g. production patterns, acquisition geometry (i.e. edge of the survey) and SOA) were best avoided.\nThe studied dataset consists of post-stack 3D seismic amplitude data and azimuthal density borehole image logs from three horizontal wells (Fig. 2a, b and c). The 3D seismic amplitude data were acquired prior to the onset of injection in the southern part field in 2014. The seismic data has binsize dimensions of 12.5\u00a0m by 12.5\u00a0m by 3.06\u00a0m. At reservoir depth, the vertical resolution and horizontal resolution were estimated to be 19\u00a0m and 63\u00a0m (determined with the point spread function), respectively. Reservoir markers such as the Top Balder and Top Upper Ekofisk can be identified (Fig. 2b). In addition to the 3D seismic data, a 4D time-strain cube (i.e. the time-shift of the seismic signal caused by changes in the reservoir properties (e.g. Rickett et al., 2007)) was used to evaluate how faults and fractures impact production (section 5.2). This 4D time-strain cube was created by combining two seismic cubes, which were acquired at different times (i.e. prior to injection and production and during active injection and production).\nThe three horizontal wells investigated in this study (wells A, B and C) were drilled into the Upper - and Lower Ekofisk Formation, respectively (Fig. 2a) (Well A: Upper Ekofisk and Well B & C: Lower Ekofisk). These wells are currently being utilized as injectors. The three respective azimuthal density image logs (ALD) have a relatively low resolution (i.e. vertical sampling ALD\u00a0=\u00a015.24\u00a0cm with respect to the vertical sampling of high-resolution FMI\u00a0=\u00a00.254\u00a0cm). This makes the interpretation of small scale and individual fractures difficult (Fig. 2c). However, while the resolution is low these logs can be used to identify larger features (fractured or faulted rocks) showing distinct changes in the rock density (Fig. 2c) (e.g. Ibrayev et al., 2016).\n\n\n3.2\nLarge-scale seismic discontinuity analysis\nFaults detectable on seismic data were detected using five edge attributes (Aqrawi and Boe, 2011; Boe, 2012; Bounaim et al., 2013) (Fig. 3\n): 1) edge detection with a dip-guided 3D Sobel attribute, 2) edge enhancement with a 3D Radon filter, 3) background adjustment, 4) additional edge enhancement (ridge detection attribute) and 5) scaling of edges using a voxel-by-voxel arithmetic calculation. The edges attributes were conditioned in such a way that only structural elements with a measurable seismic displacement were detected.\nThe first step in this workflow was edge detection using a dip-guided 3D Sobel attribute (Amplitude Contrast) (Fig. 3b) (Aqrawi and Boe, 2011). This attribute highlights areas where the seismic amplitude is disturbed or displaced and could therefore indicate faults, changes in depositional environment, or the reworking of sediments. In the second step, the seismic signature of medium-to large-scale faults was enhanced by subsequently applying a 3D Radon filter (Edge Enhancement 1) (Boe, 2012) (Fig. 3c). This filter enhanced planar seismic features by iteratively comparing, summing, averaging and smoothing the discontinuities (i.e. results of step 1) along planes with arbritrary dips and dip-directions (bounds of the allowed plane rotations are defined by the user), so that larger 3D discontinuities were enhanced, while smaller features, such as noise, were smoothed away (Boe, 2012). The third step involved the adjustment of the background, i.e. subtracting the Gaussian horizontal mean from the enhanced edge cube (Fig. 3d). In the fourth step, another edge enhancement step was performed to detect ridges (Edge Evidence attribute in Petrel) (Fig. 3e). Finally, the seismic cubes from steps 3 and 4 were multiplied, using a dataset specific best practice approach (i.e. calculator expressions formations were dependent on the input data and output discontinuity cubes) (Step 5) (Fig. 3f). The resulting discontinuity cube was then normalized, such that larger and wider faults have values close to 1.0, while subtle discontinuities are represented by values ranging between 0.2 and 0.6. Areas without faults or discontinuities have values close to zero. The normalized discontinuity cube was used to characterize the large faults within the Ekofisk Field.\n\n\n3.3\nSmall-scale seismic discontinuity analysis\nSmall-scale discontinuities (e.g. fractured rock) were more difficult to detect using the contrast in seismic amplitude. For this reason, these discontinuities were detected using 3D seismic vector attributes (Bounaim et al., 2019; Haege et al., 2013) (Fig. 4\n). This approach consists of the calculations of three subsequent volume attributes: 1) Normal vector calculations, 2) computation of the curl attribute and 3) computation of the small-scale seismic discontinuity cube (Fig. 5\n) (Bounaim et al., 2019; Haege et al., 2013).\nThe first step in the small-scale discontinuity analysis was the computation of the normal vectors of the seismic data in the three seismic components (Figs. 4 and 5a-b (step 1)). Here, the normal vector field was generated using a polynomial reconstruction of the seismic signal (Sonneland et al., 1998), which allowed for calculation of derivatives in each direction (inline, crossline, vertical). For consistency, the vectors were normalized to unit length and point upwards (Fig. 4). These three components of the normal vector field (VnIL, VnXL and VnZ) were used to calculate the dip and azimuth of the small scale discontinuities (Bounaim et al., 2019). In the second step, the curl of the normal-vector components was computed (Fig. 5c). This attribute captured abrupt spatial changes (rotation) in the normal vector data within each seismic voxel, thereby making it very effective in detecting subtle changes in the seismic reflection data (Bounaim et al., 2019). The final step involved the computation of the magnitude of the three curl attribute components (Step 3) (Fig. 5d). This magnitude cube was proven to be efficient for identifying fractured rock in a previous case study (Haege et al., 2014) and will be used for characterizing small scale discontinuities (e.g. fractured rock) throughout this study.\n\n\n3.4\nFracture interpretation from borehole image logs\nThe three aforementioned azimuthal density image logs were analysed using the Schlumberger Techlog wellbore software platform. Fractures were interpreted using a consistent resolution (1:100 (MD)), as features showing abrupt changes in the density and porosity log as well as clear changes in the borehole image log itself (i.e. both an increase and a decrease with respect to the background data) (Fig. 2c). Because of the quality and type of the utilized borehole data (Fig. 2c), discrimination between the different structural features present within the Ekofisk reservoir formations (i.e. tectonic fractures, stylolite-associated fractures, irregular fractures, and healed fractures) was impossible. Therefore, the interpreted features will collectively be called fractures throughout this paper. However, we acknowledge that this is a simplification that should be addressed in future studies, since the structural discontinuities present within the Ekofisk reservoir formations have different mechanical origins and have a distinct impact on the effective permeability (Peacock et al., 2016; Toublanc et al., 2005).\nFrom the interpreted fracture data, the Terzaghi corrected fracture intensity (P10) along the different wells was calculated (Fig. 6\na) (Terzaghi, 1965). Subsequently, the computed P10 was smoothed using a constant sampling window of 122\u00a0m (400\u00a0ft) (Fig. 6b). Such a large sampling window was chosen so that zones of intensively fractured rock could be identified and compared to the seismic discontinuity data. Apart from the fracture intensity, the orientation distributions of the interpreted fractures were acquired for each well.\n\n\n3.5\nWell to seismic correlation\nTo assess the correlation between the seismic attributes and the interpreted well data, the results of the seismic discontinuity analysis, i.e. small- and large-scale seismic-discontinuity cubes, were extracted along each well. This was done using the well-seismic tool in Petrel and data was extracted along a 40\u00a0m wide plane which was parallel to the trajectory of each analysed well (see Petrel manual for additional information on the data extraction). Subsequently, the extracted seismic data were compared to the interpreted fracture intensity and orientation, so that a qualitative correlation could be established.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nLarge-scale discontinuity detection\nThe results of the seismic fault detection workflow (Fig. 3) indicate that the Upper - and Lower Ekofisk Formation are heavily faulted (Fig. 7\na\u2013b), with the extracted faults showing three main orientations: 1) NNW-SSE, 2) NNE-SSW, and 3) WNW-ESE. Smaller E-W faults are also observed (Fig. 7a\u2013b). For simplicity these E-W faults have been categorized in the WNW-ESE group.\nThe WNW-ESE fault group is believed to be linked to the underlying WNW-ESE striking Jurassic rift faults and mainly occurs in clustered zones in the northern and western part of the study area (Fig. 7a\u2013b). Faults within the WNW-ESE fault group show relatively low displacement values and are generally not observed within the overlying Balder Formation (Fig. 7a\u2013d). The locality of the clustered WNW-ESE fault zones is consistent with previous interpretations of the Ekofisk fault network (e.g. Toublanc et al., 2005) (Fig. 2a).\nThe dominant NNW-SSE faults strike parallel to the major hinge axis of the Ekofisk dome structure. These faults are thought to be related to major doming events, and are most dominant in the Upper Ekofisk - and Balder Formation (Fig. 7a\u2013d). Within the Lower Ekofisk Formation, the dominance of the NNW-SSE fault group is less apparent (Fig. 7a\u2013d). Faults belonging to the NNW-SSE fault group show both inversion and normal faulting, implying that this fault group has been affected by the Late Cretaceous to Eocene NNE-SSW compressive events (Fig. 7c\u2013d) (Gennaro, 2011).\nThe NNE-SSW fault group is easily detectable from the seismic data. It shows normal displacement and is present throughout the Ekofisk - and Balder Formation (Fig. 7). These NNE-SSW faults displace the Ekofisk dome structure, suggesting that they continued to be active after the major doming events. Similarly to was observed in previous fault interpretations (e.g. Toublanc et al., 2005) our results show that this fault group is mainly clustered near the centre of the dome (Figs. 1b and 7).\n\n\n4.2\nSmall-scale discontinuity analysis\nThe analysis of small-scale discontinuities indicates that for the Upper Ekofisk Formation, the highest discontinuity attribute magnitudes (values ranging between 0.25 and 0.70) can be found in proximity to the larger NNE-SSW faults and along the WNW-ESE fault corridor (Figs. 7a and 8\na). The areas in proximity to NNW-SSE and other smaller faults show magnitudes slightly higher than 0.15 (i.e. dark grey features). Apart from the faulted areas, the attribute map shows relatively low values (i.e. magnitudes lower than 0.15) (Fig. 8a), which most likely implies that apart from faulted areas, very few small-scale discontinuities are present within the Upper Ekofisk Formation.\nThe Lower Ekofisk Formation shows more detectable small-scale seismic discontinuities (Fig. 8b). Again, the results indicate that high-attribute values occur along large fault planes present within the Lower Ekofisk Formation (e.g. the NNE-SSW - and WNW-ESE faults) (Fig. 8a\u2013b). However, the results also show that within the Lower Ekofisk Formation, areas which show high discontinuity magnitudes exist in locations where no faults are detected (Figs. 7b and 8b). For example, in the northern and western edges of the study area, large WNW-ESE and NW-SE elongated discontinuities are present in areas where only a few large faults were extracted (Figs. 7b and 8b). The orientation of these small-scale features is roughly parallel to the faults that are in proximity, and this could imply that they represent small structural features such as fracture corridors (Figs. 7b and 8b). However, in the southern and eastern edges of the study area, these features do not seem to align with the local fault orientations (Figs. 7b and 8b). A possible explanation for this observation is that within these areas, the small-scale discontinuities represent debris flows which are known to be present within the Lower Ekofisk \u2013 and Tor Formation (Gennaro et al., 2013). Alternatively, these discontinuities could represent an artifact in the utilized Lower-Ekofisk horizon.\n\n\n4.3\nThe combined seismic discontinuity cube\nFor the Ekofisk Field, the faults and tectonic fractures are believed to be structurally related (i.e. fault-related fracturing) (Agarwal et al., 1997; Toublanc et al., 2005). This implies that within our workflow both the large- and small-scale discontinuity cubes (Figs. 7 and 8) can be associated with fractured or faulted zones.\nTherefore, to create a representative discontinuity cube, the results of the small- and large-scale discontinuity analysis are normalized and added together. The resulting cube is called the seismic discontinuity cube and this cube is representative for both large- and small-scale discontinuities (e.g. faults and fractures) which are detectable from seismic (Fig. 9\na\u2013d). This cube will be used for further evaluation against the image log data.\n\n\n4.4\nBorehole image log interpretation\nThe borehole image log interpretation results show similar orientations with respect to the faults detected on the seismic (i.e. NNW-SSE -, NNE-SSW -, WNW-ESE - and smaller E-W faults) (Figs. 7 and 10a-\nb). Based on the measured orientation, the interpreted fractures can be subdivided into four groups, namely: NW-SE, WNW-ESE, ENE-WSW, and NE-SW (Fig. 10a\u2013b). The dip data indicate that 81% of the interpreted fractures have a dip ranging between 45\u00b0 \u2264 dip \u2264 90\u00b0 (Fig. 10a\u2013b), verifying that the interpreted features mainly represent tectonic fractures (e.g. Agarwal et al., 1997; Jones et al., 2014; Teufel and Farrell, 1990; Toublanc et al., 2005).\nDiscriminating the fracture data per well shows that each well is characterized by two fracture orientations (Table 1\n, Fig. 10a\u2013b). The orientation distributions of wells A and B highlight that the most dominant fracture groups strike approximately NW-SE and NE-SW (Table 1, Fig. 10a\u2013b). The similarities between the two wells are expected because wells A and B are both located in the southern part of the study area and drilled sub-parallel to each other (Fig. 2a). Moreover, seismic discontinuities in proximity to these two wells show similar orientations to those interpreted in the image logs (Fig. 7a\u2013b, 9a-b and 10 a-b). Well C is characterized by NNW-SSE and E-W striking fractures (Fig. 10a\u2013b and Table 1). Again, these fracture orientations are also observed in the seismic discontinuity data in proximity to well C (Fig. 7a\u2013b, 9a-b and 10 a-b).\nAlthough extracted fracture groups show similar orientation with respect to the seismic discontinuity data, it should be noted that fractures striking parallel to the well orientation are most likely under-sampled and under-represented in the acquired orientation distribution (Fig. 10b). This implies that for wells A and B, the NNW-SSE striking features and for well C, the NE-SW striking fractures are under-represented because they strike parallel to the respective well trajectory (Fig. 10b).\nThe borehole image log interpretation also indicates that most fractures show clustering behaviour and that fractures can be grouped in different zones showing relatively high intensity magnitudes (Fig. 6a\u2013b and 10c-d) (Sanderson and Peacock, 2019). For Well A, the interpretation indicates that five different zones of relatively high intensity fracturing could be identified (Fig. 10c\u2013d). The intensity distribution for well B shows that the different fractures clusters can be grouped in two distinct zones, that are separated by a relatively long interval which shows almost no fracturing (Fig. 10c\u2013d). Well C, has a more continuous fracture intensity signal and the results indicate that the interpreted features can roughly be sub-divided into two separate zones (Fig. 10c\u2013d).\n\n\n4.5\nComparison between image logs and seismic discontinuity data\nThe extraction of seismic data along each well, allows for the comparison of the seismic discontinuity cube and interpreted image log data (Fig. 11\na\u2013b). The results indicate that for well A, the peaks in the interpreted fracture intensity distribution have a good qualitative fit with the peaks in the seismic discontinuity signal, with most of the high intensity zones being captured by the seismic discontinuity cube. Well B has a reasonable fit between the seismic discontinuity data and interpreted fracture intensity distribution. Here, the different zones of fracturing are captured by the seismic discontinuity cube. The seismic signal extracted along well C shows a signal with two distinct peaks, which roughly correlate with the centres of the two interpreted fracture zones. This implies that well C also shows a reasonable qualitative correlation with the seismic data (Fig. 11a\u2013b).\nWhile a qualitative correlation is observed, discrepancies between the interpreted fracture intensity and seismic signal are also noted (Fig. 11a\u2013b). For example, in well B, the start and measured intensity of the first fracture zone has not fully been captured by the seismic discontinuity cube. Furthermore, the peak in the seismic discontinuity signal observed at MD\u00a0=\u00a04420\u00a0m does not fully coincide with a peak in fracture intensity (Fig. 11b). In well C, the two distinct fracture zones are not fully captured by the seismic discontinuity data (Fig. 11a\u2013b). These observed differences could potentially be explained by the seismic resolution or uncertainties in the velocity model. For instance, some of the interpreted fractures could fall below the seismic resolution. Furthermore, due to uncertainties in the velocity model, small discrepancy between the depth of the well data and depth of the seismic could exist.\nBy extracting the azimuth data of the seismic discontinuity cubes (i.e. can be computed from the three normal vector components (Fig. 5b)) along each well, the orientation distributions of the interpreted fractures and the seismic discontinuities can be compared. The results show that for all wells, the dominant orientations observed in the image logs are also observed and sampled in by the seismic discontinuity cube (Fig. 12\na\u2013c and Table 1) (i.e. Well A: NW-SE, NE-SW, E-W, well B: NW-SE, NE-SW and well C: NW-SE, E-W). Furthermore, the orientation distribution from the seismic data highlights an additional fracture group (Fig. 11a\u2013c). This group strikes parallel to the well trajectory and could therefore not be sampled by the image log interpretation (Fig. 12a\u2013c and Table 1) (i.e. NNW-SSE for well A and B and NE-SW for well C).\nHowever, as was observed with the fracture intensity correlation, small discrepancies between the orientation distributions do exist. Here, a possible explanation for the differences could be the resolution of the available image logs, which is relatively low (Fig. 2), potentially impacting the accuracy of the actual interpretation and thereby of the measured fracture orientations. Another possible explanation is that the seismic and well data sample the observed structural features in different proportions.\nIn summary, our results show that the seismic and well data show a qualitative correlation, emphasizing that the seismic discontinuity cube can be used for identifying zones of relatively high-density fracturing (Figs. 10 and 11). Additionally, the orientation data in the discontinuity cube can be utilized to identify the dominant strike of the fractured zones (Figs. 5 and 12).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nA seismic-driven workflow for characterizing natural faults and fractures in the Ekofisk Field\nIn complex reservoirs such as the Ekofisk Field understanding the spatial distribution, geometry and intensity of natural fracture and fault systems is seen as an integral component in predicting the effective permeability and potential fluid flow patterns (Agarwal et al., 1997; Hauk\u00e5s et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2014; Teufel and Farrell, 1990; Tolstukhin et al., 2012, 2014; Toublanc et al., 2005). Here, fractures and faults are believed to greatly enhance the permeability of the normally tight chalk rocks, making production possible (e.g. Agarwal et al., 1997; Toublanc et al., 2005). Therefore, to better predict fluid-flow behavior during production, several attempts have been made to map the fracture intensity and effective permeability using a variety of methods. For instance, Toublanc et al. (2005) used mappable faults and empirical relations to create reservoir scale fracture intensity and effective permeability models. Agarwal et al. (1997) used a positive relationship between matrix porosity and fracture intensity to map the effective permeability. A more recent method involves the inclusion of 4D seismic data in order to update existing reservoir models (e.g. Tolstukhin et al., 2014; Tolstukhin et al., 2012).\nThis study used a seismic-driven workflow to characterize the spatial distribution of the natural fault and fracture network present within the southern Ekofisk Field. The workflow comprises of newly developed seismic attributes (Boe, 2012; Bounaim et al., 2013, 2019; Haege et al., 2013; Hauk\u00e5s et al., 2018) in order to detect large-scale (e.g. faults) and small-scale discontinuities (e.g. fractures rock). The resulting discontinuity cubes show fault orientations and network geometries which are comparative to previous fault interpretations (e.g. Toublanc et al., 2005), acknowledging that the presented workflow could be utilized for extracting structural features up to the resolution of the seismic data. Further, the discontinuities detected on the seismic highlighted qualitative correlations with fracture data interpreted from the available image logs (Figs. 11 and 12), which implies that the presented seismic discontinuity cube could be used for identifying zones of relatively high intensity fracturing and faulting.\nHowever, while the qualitative correlation between the seismic and well data holds valuable information, a direct \u2013 and quantitative correlation between the two datasets was not observed (Fig. 11). This implies that improvements to the workflow and results are necessary before the seismic discontinuity cubes can be used as quantitative input for modelling the tectonic fracture network at reservoir level. These improvements can range from adding steps to the seismic discontinuity workflow (see section 5.3) to introducing core - and higher resolution borehole image data (e.g. Teufel and Farrell, 1990; Toublanc et al., 2005), thereby: 1) reducing the uncertainties in the extracted seismic discontinuities, and 2) better characterizing the different structural features present within the Ekofisk reservoir formations (i.e. tectonic fractures, stylolite-associated fractures, irregular fractures, and healed fractures).\nAnother possible improvement is to do a more in-depth analysis of the available image log - and seismic discontinuity data. For example, the interpreted fracture intensity (P10) and the observed seismic discontinuity data could be differentiated by orientation (Figs. 10\u201312), so that a better geological understanding between the small- and large-scale structural features is achieved. By doing so, the presented results could potentially be fitted to different fault damage zone models, thereby allowing for the translation of seismic discontinuity data to different fault\/fracture probability models (e.g. Gauthier et al., 2002; Mayolle et al., 2019; Toublanc et al., 2005).\n\n\n5.2\nPotential implications for the Ekofisk field and other complex reservoir studies\nWe propose that the presented workflow and results can improve the characterization of the Ekofisk and other complex reservoir studies. For instance, the extracted seismic discontinuity cube can help in identifying zones which have a high probability of being significantly faulted or fractured. Furthermore the presented discontinuity cubes could be evaluated against dynamic data such as 4D seismic, which measures the change in seismic behaviour (i.e. time shift, amplitude and impedance) caused by production or injection over time (e.g. Folstad, 2016; Tolstukhin et al., 2014; Tolstukhin et al., 2012). (Folstad, 2016; Hauk\u00e5s et al., 2018)\nFor the Ekofisk reservoir formations, negative seismic changes (i.e. 4D seismic hardening) are generally associated with 1) an increase of the water saturation, 2) rock compaction, 3) pressure depletion, and 4) channelized fluid flow caused by the presence of natural faults and fractures. This implies that, along actively injecting wells, the 4D seismic hardening data should show similar patterns as the seismic discontinuities and natural fractures. Therefore, to better understand whether such a correlation exists, seismic hardening data were extracted along a plane parallel to Well B (active injector well) and projected on top of the seismic discontinuity cube (Fig. 13\n). The depicted 4D changes represent the difference in two seismic datasets after 4 years of water injection. This figure shows that in most areas close to the trajectory of Well B, the 4D anomalies follow the general trend observed in the seismic discontinuity cube. This geometric fit suggests that the seismic discontinuity cube is representative of faults and fractures which increase the effective permeability and therefore channel fluid flow.\nWhile a geometric overlap between the two datasets exists, further research is needed to fully understand the correlation between observable discontinuities and 4D seismic changes. Therefore, we propose that the seismic discontinuity cube can provide a starting-point for an ensemble-based 4D seismic history-matching workflow as suggested by Hauk\u00e5s et al. (2018) or Tolstukhin et al. (2014). Here, the seismic discontinuity cube can be used to generate different effective permeability and\/or discrete fracture network models which can be implemented into dynamic reservoir simulations. The results of these simulations can then be compared to production data at the wells or to 4D changes observed in the seismic, so that geologically constrained reservoir models can be generated.\n\n\n5.3\nPotential improvements to the small-scale seismic discontinuity workflow\nAttributes using the rotation of normal vectors calculated from the seismic data could be used for the detection of small-scale discontinuities which fall at the limit of the seismic resolution (Bounaim et al., 2019; Haege et al., 2013). In this study, these attributes were used for detecting intensively fractured rock. However, because these attributes use subtle rotations in the seismic data for discontinuity detection, they could be very sensitive to random seismic noise, which may lead to erroneous results and\/or interpretations. Therefore, to minimize this potential issue in future studies, we suggest that signal to noise studies should be conducted, so that the sensitivity of the small-scale discontinuity workflow in relation to seismic noise is better assessed and quantified.\nAnother improvement to the workflow concerns sedimentary features such as debris or mass flows. These deposits are known to be present within the Ekofisk - and Tor Formation (Gennaro et al., 2013) and due to their dipping beds, may well cause distinct rotations in the seismic data. This implies that using the current settings of the small-scale discontinuity analysis, these sedimentary structures could well be present within the seismic discontinuity cubes. The extraction of sedimentary features could potentially explain the high discontinuity magnitudes that were detected in areas where no large-scale faults were observed (e.g. southern and eastern edges of the Lower Ekofisk Formation) (Figs. 7 and 8). Therefore, to avoid the potential extraction of discontinuities caused by sedimentary structures in future studies, we propose that an additional vertical dip filter can be implemented to the small-scale discontinuity workflow.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study implements a workflow of seismic-discontinuity extraction and image log-interpretation, in order to create a 3D seismic discontinuity cube which is representative of the fault - and fracture network present within the southern part of the Ekofisk Chalk Field, offshore Norway.\nThe results of the seismic discontinuity analysis show that extracted faults mainly show three orientations, namely: NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW, and WNW-ESE. Apart from these three main orientations, smaller E-W striking faults are also observed. These observed fault orientations are consistent with earlier interpretations presented in literature.\nThe results of the small-scale discontinuity analysis indicate that most detectable features occur in proximity to \u2013 or follow the orientation of larger-scale faults present within the study area. The results also show that within the Upper Ekofisk Formation, very few small-scale discontinuities are present away from larger faults. Within Lower Ekofisk Formation the small-scale discontinuities are more widespread and show higher magnitudes.\nThe image log interpretation indicates that fractures depict a similar pattern with respect to the extracted faults, and show four main orientations, namely: NW-SE, WNW-ESE, ENE-WSW and NE-SW. The extracted dip data ranges between 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, thereby suggesting that most of the interpreted fractures belong to the tectonic fracture group. The conducted intensity analysis shows that fractures mainly occur in clusters. These clusters mostly concentrate in larger separated zones showing relatively high fracture intensity.\nAt the well locations the extracted seismic discontinuity-cube shows a qualitative correlation with the interpreted fracture data, with most of the interpreted fracture zones being captured by the seismic discontinuity cube. Further, for all studied wells, the computed orientation of the seismic discontinuities is similar to the orientation of the interpreted fractures. Moreover, at the location of well B, the interpreted fractures and extracted seismic discontinuities show a geometric fit with 4D seismic hardening effects caused by four years of injection.\nFinally, based on presented results, we suggest that the seismic discontinuity cube is most likely representative for faults and fractures which actively channel fluids within the Ekofisk Field. Therefore, we propose that the presented workflow and results could be utilized in future projects in order to better assess the impact of natural faults and fractures within the Ekofisk Chalk Field and other structurally complex reservoirs. However, it should be noted that improvements to the workflow and presented dataset are necessary before such a feat can be fully achieved.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nQuinten Boersma: Software, Formal analysis, Project administration, Conceptualization, Writing - review & editing, Visualization, Data interpretation.

Variations of physical-chemical conditions with depth result in changes of the degree of strain localization and in rheological weakening of the uppermost and middle-to-lower crust (Sibson, 1977; Handy et al., 2007). The sheared rocks, formed at great depths during faulting, are preserved in exhumed rocks with older fabrics and are overprinted by a later reactived faults (Cao and Neubauer, 2016). In the experimental studies, at depth and elevated temperatures, rock fabrics undergo systematic changes, such as grain coarsening, dynamic recrystallization, mineral reactions and phase transitions. In particular, microstructures and dynamically recrystallized grain sizes are of great importance because they provide information about the flow stress of deformed rock and strain localization in the Earth's crust and mantle (e.g., Rutter, 1995; Cao et al., 2013). It is noteworthy that recent experiments confirmed and quantified that specific rheological weak minerals, such as clay minerals (e.g., Lockner and Morrow, 2011), talc (e.g., Moore and Lockner, 2008; Collettini et al., 2009), serpentine minerals (e.g., chrysotile and lizardite) (e.g., Tesei et al., 2018; Viti and Hirose, 2010; 2018) and smectite (montmorillonite) (e.g., Moore and Lockner, 2007; Tesei et al., 2015), have low coefficients of friction. Especially, the graphitic carbon has received some attention since it forms during friction experiments (Yund et al., 1990), and formation of silica gel or amorphous carbon material is suggested to cause dramatic fault weakening at intermediate to high slip rates (Goldsby and Tullis, 2002; De Paola et al., 2015; Spagnuolo et al., 2016).\nGraphitic material exhibits a large range of structures and chemical compositions, from amorphous-like compounds, through a myriad of turbostratic structure to crystalline graphite (Ross and Bustin, 1990; Nover et al., 2005; Beyssac and Rumble, 2014; Rumble, 2014). The graphitic carbon-bearing rocks widely occurr in low-to high-grade metamorphic rocks. In many low-grade metamorphic rocks, graphitic carbon (e.g., soot, low-grade coal) is often associated with brittle fault gouges whereas in middle-grade metamorphic terrains, crystalline graphite is most commonly seen in marble, schist or paragneiss (e.g., Beyssac et al., 2002a, b; Walter, 2004; Nover et al., 2005; Selverstone, 2005; Aoya et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2013; Nakamura et al., 2015; Cao and Neubauer, 2019; Chen et al., 2019). The crystallinity of carbonaceous compounds is mainly controlled by thermal metamorphism, gradually ordered from an amorphous stage, which is called graphitization. This ordering process is irreversible, and the resulting structure is not affected by subsequent retrograde metamorphism. Consequently, graphitization is believed to be a reliable indicator of peak temperature conditions of a metamorphic rock (e.g., Beyssac et al., 2002b; Lahfid et al., 2010; L\u00fcnsdorf et al., 2017). The method of vitrinite reflectance (VR) is well suited to measure the maximum temperature (O'Hara, 2004; Kaneki et al., 2018). However, some researchers argued that VR could fail to estimate the maximum temperature in a fault zone, and could lead to overestimation or underestimation for the reason of mechanochemical or faulting effects (Kitamura et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2015). On the other hand, the method of Raman spectroscopy is suggested in multiple studies to evaluate the maturity of carbon material and the deformation processes as a \u201cthermometer\u201d (Nakamura et al., 2015; Kuo et al., 2018). But Kirilova et al., 2017 suggested that the calibrated graphite \u201cthermometer\u201d is ambiguous in active tectonic settings because brittle processes cause mechanical modifications of the aggregate graphite crystallinity. Previous laboratory experiments also show that graphitic carbon formed in the rock, can significantly affect the mechanical properties of the fault during the process of faulting, inducing substantial reduction of friction resistance of the fault with respect to typical frictional behavior such as revealed by Byerlee et al. (1978). This process can effectively cause reaction weakening and strain localization (Upton and Craw, 2008). Thus, the graphitic carbon is thought to play an important role as solid lubrication resulting in fault weakening (e.g., Oohashi et al., 2011, 2013; 2014; Kuo et al., 2014; Cao and Neubauer, 2019). However, its deformation and metamorphic environment and the constraints on the rheological behavior of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks are still rarely discussed and require further detailed studies in natural fault zones.\nIn this contribution, we investigate the macrostructural and microstructural features of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks within a major crustal-scale shear zone of Southeast Asian, the Ailaoshan-Red River fault zone (ASRR-FZ). This strike-slip fault zone formed as a result of the Cenozoic continental collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates (Tapponnier and Molnar, 1977). Here, we focus on the strain gradient outlined by a gradual increasing metamorphism and deformation of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks. Using optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) with electron back-scattering diffraction (EBSD) and Raman spectroscopy analyses, we describe the progressive evolution of microstructures and associated changes in active metamorphic and deformation processes.\n\n\n2\nRegional geological setting\nThe pervasive tectonic activity in Southeast Asia since the Eocene is widely cited as the consequence of Cenozoic continental collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates (Tapponnier and Molnar, 1977; Molnar, 1989; Molnar and Lyoncaen, 1989). Collision not only resulted in formation of the Tibet Plateau and change of the topography and climate of the surrounding areas, but also resulted in lateral escape of surrounding blocks, including their extension and rotation (All\u00e8gre et al., 1984; Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992; Molnar et al., 1993). A series of large-scale continental strike-slip fault zones extends well beyond the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau, and affected Southeast Asia. In the SE Asia, from east to west, there are the Ailaoshan-Red River fault zone (ASRR-FZ), the Chongshan fault zone (CS-FZ) and the Gaoligong fault zone (GLG-FZ) (Molnar and Lyoncaen, 1989b; Leloup et al., 1995; Chung et al., 1998; Cao et al., 2011a, b) (Fig. 1\n\n).\nThe over 1000\u00a0km long NW-trending ASRR-FZ is considered as the most obvious discontinuous tectonic boundary of the Yangtze block to the northeast and the Indochina block to the southwest, causing the more than 500\u00a0km southward escape of the Indochina block as a result of lateral escape tectonics, possibly accompanied by the opening of the South China Sea basin (e.g., Tapponnier and Molnar, 1977; England and Molnar, 1990; Leloup et al., 1995). The large scale ASRR-FZ has the characteristics of long-term and multiphase activity, mainly suggested by an early stage of left-lateral shearing, a late stage of right-lateral transtensional faulting, tectonic-magmatic activity and exhumation of high-grade metamorphic complexes (e.g., Leloup et al., 1995; Chung et al., 1998; Cao et al., 2011a; Liu et al., 2012, 2019) (Fig. 3\n\n). Metamorphism, structure, and thermochronology of the high-grade metamorphic rocks in the metamorphic complex show that the large-scale left-lateral ductile shearing occurred between 31 and 17\u00a0Ma (Fig. 3). The ALS massif slowly cooled to very low temperatures between Late Miocene and Pleistocene\/Holocene times.\n\n\n3\nAnalytical methods\n\n3.1\nScanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis\nField Scanning Electron Microscope (FSEM) studies have been carried out for detailed sub-microscopic microstructure analysis. The FSEM was carried out to obtain the backscatter diffraction images in the State Key Laboratory of Geological Process and Mineral Resources of China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) using a Quanta 450 FEG instrument of FEI Company. Scanning was completed under low-vacuum conditions, and the resolution of the instrument is 2.5\u00a0nm\u00a0at 30\u00a0KV (BSE).\n\n\n3.2\nElectron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analyses\nDetailed microstructural observations and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements were conducted on thin sections from the ALS metamorphic complex. By standard, all thin sections were prepared parallel to the kinematic XZ section, i.e. parallel to the stretching lineation and, where visible, normal to the foliation. EBSD is a method using scanning electron microscopy to obtain information on crystallographic preferred orientation of main rock-constitutive minerals like quartz (e.g., Prior and Wheeler, 1999; Stipp et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2011b). The experiments were carried out in State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) using a FEI Quanta 450 FEG-SEM field emission scanning electron microscope and Nordlys \u2161 EBSD detector by measuring the mineral crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Before the experimental test, the oriented thin section has been polished by high precision. Polishing was performed by using first an Al2O3 suspension with a particle size of 3.5\u00a0\u03bcm and 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively, to polish the thin section, and then using a diamond suspension with a grain diameter of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm and finalized using an Al2O3 suspension with a particle size of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcm for the final high precision polishing. The samples were finally cleaned in an ultrasonic bath to prevent the residuals of the polishing fluid affecting the accuracy of the experiment. Before the test, a conductive tape attached to the thin section surface of measurement area was used to reduce charging effects as far as possible. Then the polished thin sections were mounted in the scanning electron microscope chamber with a 70\u00b0 incidence angle in respect to the electron beam, and the lineation of the thin section (structural X reference direction) is parallel to the SEM X-axis. The electron backscatter patterns (EBSP) were acquired under low-vacuum conditions, low acceleration voltage of 20\u00a0kV, a detector distance of 160\u00a0mm, and a beam working distance of ca. 19\u201322\u00a0mm and was completed with the mode of automatic mapping. Indexing was accepted when at least six detected kikuchi bands matched with those in the standard reflector file, the Mean Angular Deviation (MAD) is set to 1.5. After the completed test, EBSP analysis was carried out using the HKL Channel 5 software package, and the pole figures of representative lattice preferred orientation in samples were plotted in lower-hemisphere equal-area stereographic diagrams.\n\n\n3.3\nRaman Spectroscopy geothermometry method\nThe Raman spectroscopy technique is a method for analyzing the scattering spectrum different from the incident light frequency, which can obtain the information of the molecular structure. The micro-laser Raman spectroscopy experiment was carried out in the State Key Laboratory of Geological Process and Mineral Resources of China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). The instrument is a Renishaw RM-1000 Micro-laser Raman spectrometer, and the experimental parameters were as follows: energy of 1.2\u00a0mW, slit size of 25\u00a0\u03bcm, exposure time of 30\u00a0s, and scanning range of 1000\u20131800\u00a0cm\u22121. The Argon ion laser was used as excitation light source, and the laser wavelength is 532\u00a0nm.\nThe Raman spectrum data of graphite were selected in 1000\u20131800\u00a0cm\u22121 wavelength, and then they were separated by the Peak Fitting analysis method (Beyssac et al., 2002b). In the first-order region (1100-1800\u00a0cm\u22121), crystal symmetry normally occurs at 1580\u00a0cm\u22121 (G-band). For poorly organized graphitic carbon, additional bands, which are called defect bands, appear in the first-order region at 1150, 1350, 1500 and 1620\u00a0cm\u22121. The 1350\u00a0cm\u22121 band (D1 band) has been commonly used as major quantitative parameters of the graphitization process (Beyssac et al., 2002b; Rahl et al., 2005), and the 1620\u00a0cm\u22121 band (D2 band) and the 1500\u00a0cm\u22121 band (D3 band) are used as secondary parameters quantitative parameters. These parameters include position, area, full wave height at half-maximum (FWHM), and the height of each characteristic band are obtained, which relate to the degree of crystallization of graphite. The fluorescence background removal and multi-peak fitting of Raman data were performed using the Origin 8 software.\nTo eliminate structural heterogeneity within the sample, at least 4\u201317 spectra are recorded for each sample, and all results are recorded in Table 1\n. In this paper, we compare different Raman formulae of Beyssac et al. (2002b) and Rahl et al. (2005), and the reliability of temperature data is obtained by calculating Standard Deviation (1\u03c3). For the SD of the former is obviously smaller than that of the latter (details in Table 1), so we admit the empirical Raman formula of Beyssac et al. (2002b) to calculate the graphite Raman temperature:\n\nTRSCM\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212445\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0R2+641\n\nR2\u00a0=\u00a0[D1\/(G\u00a0+\u00a0D1+D2)] Area, TRSCM is graphite Raman empirical formula of Beyssac et al. (2002b), and the unit is \u00b0C. Temperature can be estimated to \u00b150\u00a0\u00b0C in the range 330\u2013650\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n3.4\nCarbon isotope analysis\nFor carbon isotope analyses, samples were first crushed to 200 meshes, and treated with 15% HCl for 48h to remove carbonate materials. The calcite-free residue was rinsed 3 or 4 times with distilled water, dried at 100\u00a0\u00b0C and crushed to powder again. Subsequently, a few milligrams of the samples were combusted in sealed silica tubes in the presence of CuO at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h. The evolved CO2 was purified cryogenically and analyzed for isotopes in the mass spectrometer. Graphite samples were combusted in Flash EA 1112 and analyzed in MAT-251EM isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Several samples were re-analyzed to check for homogeneity. The results are reported in \u03b4 \u2030 relative to the VPDB standard for carbon:\n\n\u03b413C (\u2030)\u00a0=\u00a0[(Rsample \/ Rstandard) \u22121]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\n\n\n\n\n\nR\u00a0=\u00a013C\/12C, uncertainties in \u03b413C value are at about\u00b10.1\u2030.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nGeological setting of ailaoshan massif and graphitic carbon-bearing rocks\n\n4.1\nGeological setting of ailaoshan massif along the ASRR-FZ\nFour narrow NW-SE oriented high-grade metamorphic massifs, mainly composed of Middle Proterozoic gneisses, include the Xuelong Shan (XLS), Diancang Shan (DCS), Ailao Shan (ALS) metamorphic complexes in China and Day Nui Con Voi (DNCV) metamorphic complex in Vietnam, are exposed along the ASRR-FZ (Fig. 1). The Ailao Shan (ALS) massif (Figs. 1 and 2), one of the four massifs, is composed of high-grade metamorphic rocks with various late-stage granites (e.g., Leloup and Kienast, 1993; 1995, 2001; Cao et al., 2009, 2011a, b). The center of the ALS metamorphic massif is characterized by widespread exposures of Neoproterozoic amphibolites, schists, gneisses, marbles and granitic intrusions of various ages (Fig. 2). The host rocks belong to Proterozoic Ailaoshan Group and nearby Silurian metasediments. The metamorphic rocks typically have high-temperature mineral assemblages up to the amphibolite facies and contain sillimanite, garnet, staurolite and kyanite in metapelitic rocks, amphibole, plagioclase\u00b1 garnet in metamorphosed mafic volcanics, tremolite, diopside, olivine, calcite and dolomite in silicate-marbles, two feldspars, quartz and micas in metamorphosed granitoids. Structures, consistent with intense ductile to brittle shearing, are widely distributed in the metamorphic units across the mountain belt.\nAfter experiencing Cenozoic ASRR strike-slip shearing, the Proterozoic Ailaoshan Group rocks mostly present characteristics of the strong left-lateral shear deformation (Fig. 3A\u2013D). Shear senses including sheared veins, S\u2013C fabrics and asymmetric fabrics (such as \u03c3- or \u03b4-fabrics of feldspar, garnet or hornblende porphyroclasts) are well-developed (Fig. 3A\u2013C). The deformed rocks exposed along the shear zone developed a mylonitic foliation (S) and a penetrative mineral and\/or stretching lineation (L), which formed together a typical L-S-type structure (L\u00a0\u2248\u00a0S, like in mylonitic gneiss in Fig. 3C) or a L-type structure (L\u00a0\u226b\u00a0S, like ultra-mylonitic gneiss in Fig. 3D). The mineral stretching lineation (L) and mylonitic foliation (S) are mainly constituted by felsic mineral aggregates, trails of rotated garnet, feldspar, hornblende porphyroclasts and oriented and elongated mineral aggregates. The strong stretching mineral lineation L is subhorizontal or is gently plunging to the NW or SE with a pitch angle of less than 30\u00b0 (Fig. 2b). When present, the mylonitic foliation is commonly parallel to the compositional layering, and strikes approximately NNW\u2013SSE, with variable dip angles.\n\n\n4.2\nGeological setting of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks\nThe studied samples of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks were collected mostly on the eastern and western sides of the ALS metamorphic complex, between the ASRR-FZ center and the low-grade metamorphic hanging wall unit (Figs. 2, 3E\u2013L). The graphitic carbon can be observed in the high-grade metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, schist, marble, and low-grade metamorphic grade rocks such as phyllite and fault gouge. These graphitic carbon-bearing rocks suffered variable deformation including sinistral\/dextral strike-slip depending on their metamorphic grade and subsequent brittle overprint. Some developed mylonitic foliation and penetrative mineral stretching lineation to form a typical L-S-type structure. According to the field data, the mineral and stretching lineation of the graphite-bearing rocks generally plunges to NW or SE, consistent with the lineation developed in the host mylonitic rocks. The high-grade metamorphic graphitic carbon grains in layers are parallel to the macroscopic foliation like schistosity or gneissosity (Fig. 3E and F). For low-grade graphitic rocks, graphitic carbon mineral aggregates together with felsic aggregates mainly constitute of scratching lineation (striae) on the fault surface (Fig. 3G and H), or form the fault mirror surface on the fault plane (Fig. 3I). In localized high strain zones, fault gouge filled by a thin layer of graphitic carbon distributed sub-perpendicular and cross-cutting the foliation of wall rocks or parallel to it, indicating that the appearance of graphitic carbon is closely related to brittle late-stage faulting (Fig. 3J\u2013L). Figure 4\n\n\n\n\n5\nMicrostructures of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks\n\n5.1\nDeformation microstructures\nAccording to lithological, metamorphic and deformation characteristics, the graphitic-carbon bearing rocks from the ASRR-FZ can be divided into three types: Type-I, graphitic carbon material (GM) occurs in medium-grade metamorphism and\/or strongly deformed rocks (e.g., samples AL0061, AL0064, AL0068, AL0105, AL0024 and AL1627) (Fig. 5\n), Type-II: GM occurs in low-grade metamorphism and\/or deformed rocks showing strain localization (e.g., samples AL1627-1, AL0103, AL0045, AL1628, AL1832, AL16161, AL16159) (Fig. 6\n), and Type-III with GM occuring in lower-grade metamorphic rocks and weakly deformed\/undeformed rocks (e.g., samples AL0126, AL0138 and AL0145) (Fig. 7\n). The three types of graphitic-carbon bearing rocks show different lithological characteristics. We selectrepresentative samples to describe the deformation microstructure features below.\n\n5.1.1\nMicrostructures of type I graphitic carbon-bearing rocks\nThe Type-I graphitic carbon-bearing rocks present medium-grade metamorphism and strongly mylonitization. These samples are mostly from the interior of the ASRR shear zone. Gneiss sample AL0061-2 consist of quartz ribbons, fine-grained feldspars and elongated mica aggregates. Ordered flaky graphite is coexisting with micas and has a long axis ranging from 1\u00a0mm to 0.2\u00a0mm (Fig. 5A). Strongly deformed Type I samples including graphitic schist and marble show typical features of mylonitic plastic flow. The dark or gray-dark graphitic marble is fine-grained and dominated (>80% area) of elongated and fine-grained calcite and a minor component of graphite (<20% area) (Fig. 5B and C). Graphitic carbon-bearing felsic rocks are composed of graphitic carbon and adjacent fine-grained feldspar, quartz, biotite, muscovite and other opaque minerals, forming the mineral lineation (Fig. 5D\u2013I). There, extremely fine-grained minerals are homogeneously distributed in the matrix, are elongated and show a strong shape preferred orientation (SPO). Dragged trails constituted of fine-grained minerals occur around these small \u03c3- and \u03b4-fabrics rotated porphyroclasts. S\u2013C fabrics and micro-slip zones cut through quartz veins and indicate left-lateral shear (Fig. 5D\u2013G), which is consistent with the outcrop-scale left-lateral shear deformation. Graphitic carbon aggregates are enriched at the boundaries between quartz and feldspar grains, forming slip-localized micro-shear zones or continuous\/discontinuous slip-planes (Fig. 5F). Quartz grains show bands as monocrystalline ribbons or polycrystalline aggregates (Fig. 5H and I). These quartz bands show undulating extinction and variable degrees of subgrain development and subgrain rotation dynamic recrystallization. The recrystallized grains show a shape-preferred orientation, defining a foliation plane, which is oblique to the extinction banding and inclined consistent with the shear sense.\n\n\n5.1.2\nType II microstructures of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks\nThe Type-II graphitic carbon-bearing rocks occur in low-grade metamorphism and\/or locally deformed domains. These samples were mostly collected on the eastern and western side of the ALS metamorphic complex, between the ASRR-FZ center and the lower-grade metamorphic hanging wall unit. High-grade metamorphic rocks including plagioclase amphibolite, hornblende-plagioclase gneiss, biotite schist and intrusive rocks are exposed adjacent to the west of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks, which all have undergone strong mylonitization (Type I metamorphic conditions). Weakly metamorphosed to un-metamorphosed sedimentary rocks are exposed adjacent to the east part (Type III metamorphic conditions). These graphitic carbon-bearing samples show low-grade metamorphic microstructural characteristics. Plagioclase is affected by sericitization (Fig. 6, samples AL16159-2, AL16161-1, and AL16162-1). The plagioclase and quartz grains are without obvious deformation. However, localized micro-shear zones are well developed. The micro-shear zones are mostly constituted of graphitic carbon aggregates and light mineral aggregates. Graphitic carbon is enriched in the micro-shear zones and induced there grain-size reduction. Slip-localized micro-shear zones of the graphitic carbon-bearing aggregates with continuous and discontinuous slip-planes can be observed.\n\n\n5.1.3\nType III microstructures of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks\nThe Type-III graphitic carbon-bearing rocks were mostly collected from the lower-grade metamorphic hangingwall of the shear zone or from fault gouge (in the footwall unit). This type of rocks presents weakly deformed to undeformed lower grade metamorphic microstructures (Fig. 7). Plagioclase and quartz grains are slightly oriented. The size of minerals (quartz and plagioclase) varies from 30 to 100\u00a0\u03bcm. The graphitic carbon grains are distributed among these minerals, which forms either a discontinuous foliation or slip-planes.\n\n\n\n5.2\nSubmicrostructures\nIn the backscatter diffraction image, black graphitic carbon and their submicrostructures can be clearly observed (Fig. 8\n). In Type I samples, the graphitic carbon aggregates are flaky or fine-grained crystals. They often occur along feldspar, quartz and biotite grain boundaries and at triple junctions, and tend to coexist with biotite The graphitic crystal aggregates show two types of occurrences depending on shear stress, including bending\/kink bands (Fig. 8A) in weakly deformed gneiss, and slip-localized micro-shear zones or laterally continuous or discontinuous slip-planes (Fig. 8B\u2013F) in strongly deformed marble and schist. In Type II domains of deformed phyllite samples, graphitic crystal aggregates are also enriched in the slip-planes (Fig. 8G). Other single graphitic carbon grains are distributed in the matrix as dispersive flakes or equidimensional grains. The long axis of graphitic grains in strongly deformed samples (2\u201320\u00a0\u03bcm) is shorter than in weakly deformed gneiss (>100\u00a0\u03bcm). Most oriented and extended slip-planes containing graphitic crystals show a similar slip direction and are arranged sub-parallel to the stretching lineation. In the Type III weakly deformed phyllite samples (Fig. 8 H\u2013I), graphitic carbon particles mostly exist as equidimensional grains, slightly enriched in weakening defect between hard minerals lattice, showing no slip characteristic. Small graphitic carbon particles (<5\u00a0\u03bcm) occur as inclusions within the quartz grains or micro-fractures, showing a nearly equiaxial shape.\n\n\n\n6\nResults of graphite Raman Spectroscopy geothermometry\nThe metamorphic peak temperatures of twenty samples of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks are calculated by using a Raman Spectra of Carbonaceous material (RSCM) thermometry. The Raman formula of Beyssac et al. (2002b) was used to calculate the temperature. Table 1 shows the locations (longitude (\u00b0E) and latitude (\u00b0N) in decimal degrees), number of Raman spectra (Sp.), mean and SD (standard deviation, 1\u03c3) of G and D1 position, G and D1 FWHM, R1 and R2 ratio, and RSGM (Raman spectra of carbonaceous material) temperature quoted from (Beyssac et al., 2002b) and (Rahl et al., 2005) of samples. The R1 values are calculated from (D1\/G) Height, and the R2 values are calculated from [D1\/(G\u00a0+\u00a0D1+D2)] Area.\nRepresentative Raman spectra of graphitic carbon (Fig. 9\n\n) show the standard positions of the D1 defect peak (1350\u00a0cm\u22121) and the G peak (1580\u00a0cm\u22121). Previous studies also support that with the increase of deformation and metamorphic temperature, the degree of carbonaceous crystallization (graphitization) increases, the height of the defect peaks (like D1 band, represent disordered amorphous degree) gradually decreases and then disappears, while the G peak of graphitic carbon (like G band, represents ordered crystallization degree) becomes narrower and higher, and moves towards to the crystalline graphite position (1580\u00a0cm\u22121) (Beyssac et al., 2004). A variety of Raman parameters are calibrated against temperature from metamorphic studies, in order to quantify the maximum Raman temperature utilizing graphitic carbon in metamorphic rocks (Table 1). The average temperatures calculated by formula of Beyssac et al. (2002b) are between 364 and 530\u00a0\u00b0C, with the maximal temperature of 604\u00a0\u00b0C and the minimal temperature of 352\u00a0\u00b0C. The temperature data obtained are consistent with the variation of G and D1 defect peaks. The total temperature range of the study area is 350\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C. According to the derived Raman temperatures and lithological characteristics, all samples are classified into three types, which are described above (Fig. 11\n).\nIn the Type I medium-grade metamorphic and\/or strongly deformed rocks, the RSCM temperatures have an average temperature of 509\u00a0\u00b0C, with maximum temperature of 604\u00a0\u00b0C, and minimum temperature of 432\u00a0\u00b0C. The average R1 ratios vary from 0.40 to 0.19, with Standard Deviation (SD, 1\u03c3) values are less than 0.14. The R2 ratios are between 0.34 and 0.25 and the SD values are less than 0.1. The G-FWHM parameters are mostly arranged in region 1 between 20 and 32 (Fig. 12\nc), and the G peak positions are in the standard zone near the standard line of 1580\u00a0cm\u22121 (Fig. 12d). The G peak is obviously higher than D1 defect peak suggesting that the crystallinity of graphitic carbon in Type I is well developed, indicating a high-to medium peak temperature.\nThe RSCM temperature of medium-to low-grade metamorphism and\/or deformed of Type II samples is in average at 420\u00a0\u00b0C, with a maximum temperature of 540\u00a0\u00b0C, and minimum temperature of 351\u00a0\u00b0C. The average R1 ratios vary from 1.3 to 0.45, with SD values of 0.33 to 0.09. The R2 ratios are between 0.59 and 0.38 and the SD values are less than 0.09. With the degree of carbonaceous crystallization (graphitization) increase, the R1 ratios show a continuously nonlinear growth (Fig. 12a). With the decrease of temperature, the G peak shows a tendency from higher than D1 peak to lower than D1 peak, indicating a medium to low peak temperature. Divided by temperature of 400\u00a0\u00b0C, the G-FWHM parameters show differentials in region 1 between 20 and 32 (>400\u00a0\u00b0C) and region 2 between 43\u201362 (<400\u00a0\u00b0C) (Fig. 12c). The G peaks also shown in different positions near the standard line of 1580\u00a0cm\u22121 or bias to ~1600\u00a0cm\u22121. D3 defect band in 1500\u00a0cm\u22121 can be detected below 400\u00a0\u00b0C in the study.\nIn the Type III lower-grade metamorphic and weakly deformed\/undeformed rocks, the RSCM temperatures in Type \u2162 samples are lower than 400\u00a0\u00b0C, with a maximum temperature of 397\u00a0\u00b0C and minimum temperature of 357\u00a0\u00b0C. The average R1 ratios are 1.36\u20130.86 and SD values are 0.15\u20130.04. The R2 ratios are between 0.62 and 0.58 and the SD values are less than 0.01. At higher values, R1 can exhibit a significant evolution up to 3.5 whereas R2 is more or less constant between 0.6 and 0.8 (Henry et al., 2019). But in our study, the R1 ratio only reaches to 1.36 and the R2 ratio reaches to 0.62 in lower-grade metamorphic rocks and metasedimentary rocks (Table 1). The G-FWHM in Type \u2162 samples are broader than in Type I samples and arranged in the region 2 between 43 and 62 (Fig. 12c), with a bias in G positions to ~1600\u00a0cm\u22121 (Fig. 12d) and a bias in D1 position to ~1340\u00a0cm\u22121. The G peak is lower than the D1 defect peak in Type III samples, suggesting poor crystallinity of graphitic carbon and low-temperature conditions (350\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C, Fig. 9j\u2013l).\n\n\n7\nEBSD lattice preferred orientations of quartz and graphite\nTo further constrain the deformation conditions of the granitic rocks, some representative samples of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks in the ALS massif, which show different temperature conditions and graphitic material, were selected for LPO measurements. Microscopic characteristics of these samples are partly described above in Section 5. Due to heterogeneties within samples, several selected measurements from the same samples have been done. Scanning areas includes matrix quartz grains and coexisting graphite grains except quartz bands. Quartz, graphite and biotite are selected to fulfill the scanning areas with a step of 5\u00a0\u03bcm. Quartz and graphite LPO pole figures of all three types of samples are presented in Figs. 12 and 13\n and are described below.\n\n7.1\nQuartz LPOs\nIn the representative Type I samples, the quartz mainly forms elongated polycrystalline aggregates, showing evidence of recrystallization in the form of irregular, serrated grain boundaries. In the strongly deformed graphitic mylonitic schist (sample AL0024-15), pole figures of quartz show a well-developed c-<0001> girdle. The girdle shows a c-<0001> maximum near the Y-axis. The pole figure of m{10-10} and a{11\u201320} form the two weak maxima in the X-axis, and r{10\u201311} forms weak maxima in the X-Z and X\u2013Y planes. The dominant slip system is prism <a> slip (Fig. 12A). The graphitic biotite gneiss of sample AL0061-2 shows pole figures of a quartz c-<0001> maximum between the Y-Z-axis direction to form a small girdle, m{10-10} and a{11\u201320} small weak girdles in the XY plane, and a r{10\u201311} weak maximum in the X-Z plane. The dominant slip system is rhomb <a> slip (Fig. 13B). But sample AL0061-5 shows pole figures of two maxima of quartz c-<0001> between the X-Z-axis direction and a submaximum between X- and Y-axis directions. The pole figure of a{11\u201320} forms a small weak girdle in the X\u2013Y plane, and r{10\u201311} forms two weak maxima in the X-Z and X\u2013Y planes. The slip system is represented as superposition of basal <a> slip onto prism <a> slip (Fig. 13C).\nIn the representative Type II samples, the quartz mainly forms polycrystalline aggregates, showing evidence of weak recrystallization. The pole figures from sample AL1627-1 present two c-<0001> maxima in the XZ-plane. The pole figures of m{10-10}, a{11\u201320} and r{10\u201311} present weak patterns. The dominant slip system is basal <a> slip (Fig. 13D). In the sample AL16161-1, the pole figure of c-<0001> presents very weak maxima in Z- and Y-axes. The pole figures of m{10-10} and a{11\u201320} also present weak patterns, but r{10\u201311} presents a weak maximum in the Z-axis. The slip system is represented as weak superposition of basal <a> slip onto prism <a> slip (Fig. 13E).\nIn the representative Type III samples, the quartz grains mainly show evidence of weak deformation and are slightly elongated. In the phyllite sample AL0138-4, the pole figures present weak c-<0001> maxima in Z-axis. The pole figures of m{10-10}, a{11\u201320} and r{10\u201311} present weak patterns. The dominant slip system is basal <a> slip (Fig. 13F). The pole figures of phyllite sample AL0145-1 also show weak patterns, which are represented as weak maxima of Z-axis in c-<0001>, m{10-10} and r{10\u201311}, and other weak patterns in a{11\u201320}. The dominant slip system is basal <a> slip (Fig. 13G).\n\n\n7.2\nGraphite LPOs\nGraphite LPOs in Type I were also analyzed in samples AL0061-2, AL0061-5, AL0024-15 and AL0024-23, from which quartz LPOs were analyzed. The graphite particles are mainly flaky and\/or elongated and show evidence of ordered crystallization. The graphitic biotite gneiss sample AL0061-2 shows a pole figure of double two graphite c-<0001>maxima near the Z-axis direction. The pole figures of {11\u201320} and {10-10} show a girdle in the XY plane, which is containing three weak maxima, and one of them is located near Y-direction (Fig. 14\nA). In sample AL0061-5, the pole figure of c-{0001} maximum is close to Y-direction and the {11\u201320} and {10-10} great girdles are all near the X-direction (Fig. 14B). The graphitic pole figure of the graphitic schist AL0024-21 presents a c-{0001} maximum in the Y-direction and a submaximum between Y-Z-axis direction. The pole figures of {11\u201320} and {10-10} shows weak maxima in the X-axis direction (Fig. 14C). In sample AL0024-23, the pole figure of c-{0001} shows a girdle containing a maximum close the Y-direction. The pole figures of {11\u201320} and {10-10} show maxima close the XZ plane (Fig. 14D).\nIn the representative Type II samples, the graphite LPOs were analyzed in samples AL1627-1, AL16161-1 and AL16159-2. The pole figures from graphitic schist sample AL1627-1 present two c-<0001> maxima in the Z-axis. The pole figures of {11\u201320} and {10-10} present weak girdle patterns in the XY plane (Fig. 14E). The LPOs of graphite in graphitic biotite schist of samples AL16161-1 and AL16159-2 show the same patterns in the presence of c-{0001} maxima close to Z and a girdle normal to the principal [c]-axis maxima in {11\u201320} and {10-10} (Fig. 14F\u2013G).\nIn the representative Type III samples, the graphite LPOs were analyzed in samples AL0138-4 and AL0145-1. In the phyllite sample AL0138-4, the pole figure of c-{0001} presents weak maxima in the Z-axis. The pole figures of {11\u201320} and {10-10} present weak patterns (Fig. 14H). The pole figures of the phyllite sample AL0145-1 show patterns of maxima in Z-axis and Y-axis in c-{0001}, weak maxima between X-axis and Z-axis direction in {11\u201320} and other weaker pattern in {10-10} (Fig. 14I).\n\n\n\n8\nResults of carbon isotopic composition\nThe distinct \u03b413C values can provide an insight into the source and mechanism of graphite precipitation in the ASRR-FZ. In order to understand the origin of graphite, the carbon isotope compositions of graphite only from Type-I graphitic mylonitic schist from ASRR-FZ have been measured at the present. The \u03b413C values of graphite form five samples range from \u221219.88\u2030 to \u221220.75\u2030 with an average value of \u221220.24\u2030\u00b10.3\u2030, indicating graphitization of organic matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsample No.\n\u03b413C\u2030(-VPDB)\ntype\n\n\n\n\nAL023-14\n\u221220.75\nType I\n\n\nAL024-21\n\u221220.38\nType I\n\n\nAL024-24\n\u221219.88\nType I\n\n\nAL024-15\n\u221219.91\nType I\n\n\nAL024-23\n\u221220.28\nType I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\nDiscussion\n\n9.1\nDeformation and metamorphic conditions\nIn the ASRR-FZ, the processes of formation and enrichment of graphitic carbon in slip-planes and micro-shear zones are established according to the deformation-metamorphic conditions of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks (Fig. 15\n). From the center to the upper boundary of footwall unit, the types of rocks and microfabrics vary from biotite-gneiss to mylonitic schist in medium-grade metamorphic conditions, and from schist to phyllite in low-grade metamorphic conditions. The temperatures of these graphitic carbon-bearing rocks range from 350 to 600\u00a0\u00b0C, which were calibrated by the RSCM thermometry through the empirical Raman formula of Beyssac et al. (2002b). According to RSCM temperatures and structural characteristics, these graphitic carbon-bearing rocks can be divided into three types, which are Type I of medium-grade metamorphism and\/or strong deformation of graphitic gneiss and mylonitic schist (462\u2013604\u00a0\u00b0C), Type II of low-grade metamorphism and\/or strain-localized graphitic marble, schist and phyllite (352\u2013540\u00a0\u00b0C), and Type III of lower-grade metamorphism and weak deformed\/undeformed phyllite (357\u2013397\u00a0\u00b0C). From the center to the boundary of the ASRR-FZ, the occurrence of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks has a variety from medium-grade to low-grade (Fig. 15). In the interior of the shear zone (as AL0061), the graphitic carbon is ordered and flaky, represented as gneissose foliation, and in the boundary (like AL0138), the graphitic carbon occurs as amorphous or equidimensional grains. In the Types I and II, the graphitic rocks are fine-grained, and show ductile flow and left-lateral shearing characteristics.\nIn our samples, quartz LPOs in Type I show mixed slip systems, including intensive prism <a> slip (Fig. 13C), rhomb <a> slip systems (Fig. 13A) and a combined dislocation creep prism <a> and basal <a> slip system (Fig. 13B). Fabric transitions in quartz occur with variation of critical resolved shear stress as a function of temperature, which are commonly held indicative for high to middle temperature deformation with combined dislocation creep prism <a> and rhomb <a> slip (Schmid and Casey, 1986; Mainprice and Nicolas, 1989). The patterns indicate dislocation creep activity of basal <a> slip and weak prism <a> slip systems, suggesting a strong low-temperature deformation overprint on a medium-temperature deformation. Compared to quartz LPOs, the slip system of graphite shows dominant prism <a> slip system. These results are consistent with deformation and metamorphism conditions estimated from graphite Raman spectroscopy geothermometer (462\u2013604\u00a0\u00b0C). The peak metamorphic temperature of these samples indicated by graphite Raman spectroscopy geothermometer is about 600\u00a0\u00b0C, which is close to calculated metamorphic and deformation conditions (500\u2013650\u00a0\u00b0C) of ASRR shear zone center during shearing, using mica-garnet and plagioclase-garnet geothermometers (Leloup and Kienast, 1993; Cao et al., 2010Cao et al., 2010). Combining with the RSCM temperatures, we imply that the basal <a> slip of quartz owns to the low-temperature superposition after the period of graphite crystallization and during the exhumation of the metamorphic massif. The quartz LPOs in Type II show two kind of slip system, including: (1) basal <a> slip, which suggests low-temperature deformation conditions (Fig. 13D), and (2) combined weak creep prism <a> and basal <a> slip, which represents low-temperature superimposition on the middle to high temperature (Fig. 13E). Combining with the RSCM temperature, we imply that the superposition of basal <a> slip belongs to the low-temperature conditions of graphite crystallization. All quartz and graphite LPOs in Type III show weak basal <a> slip, which represents low-temperature conditions (Fig. 13F and G).\n\n\n9.2\nSource of carbon\nThe carbon isotopic composition of graphite provides us with a robust monitor of crustal processes. Once fully crystalline, graphite will not readily respond to subsequent geological processes except by dissolution\/precipitation (Craw and Upton, 2014). Graphite from different sources can be broadly characterized by the relative proportion of their stable carbon isotopes. Thus, a carbon isotopic value \u03b413C\u00a0>\u00a0\u221216\u2030 is often attributed to fluid origin, while those<\u221216\u2030 is considered to be organic in origin (Schidlowski, 1988; Kehelpannala, 1999; Sanyal et al., 2009; Touzain et al., 2010). In our study samples, so far, we only obtained the \u03b413C values of graphite from Type-I material of the ASRR-FZ. The measured five samples show the \u03b413C values range from \u221219.88\u2030 to \u221220.75\u2030, with an average value of \u221220.24\u2030\u00b10.3\u2030, indicating graphitization of organic origin. The organic matter associated with metamorphic rocks shows successive stages in the evolution of carbonaceous matter to graphite.\n\n\n9.3\nRheological weakening implication of graphitic carbon-bearing rocks in shear zone\nStudies have demonstrated that strain localization in the lithosphere is one of the major processes, as it controls the formation of shear zones over a wide scales. Several processes could potentially be responsible for strain localization and dynamic weakening of the lithosphere: (1) general rheological weakening associated with grain size reduction by dynamic recrystallization (e.g., De Bresser et al., 2001 and references therein), (2) shear heating and pseudotachylyte formation creating melt lubrication during seismic events (e.g., Sibson, 1977; Lachenbruch and Sass, 1980; Di Toro et al., 2011), (3) metamorphic reaction weakening by formation of rheologically very weak low-friction minerals such as talc, graphite, and clay minerals (e.g., Wibberley, 1999; Moore and Rymer, 2007; Collettini et al., 2009; Lockner and Morrow, 2011; Kuo et al., 2014), (4) fluid migration by release of fluids in front of uprising magma, metamorphic dehydration reactions at depth, or release of fluids from a subduction zone (e.g., Sibson, 2000; Fusseis and Menegon, 2014), and (5) phyllosilicate-bearing fault gouges, which develop by velocity weakening behavior at rapid slip rates (e.g., Niemeijer and Spiers, 2007).\nGraphitic carbon has received attention since its slip surface formed during friction experiments (Yund et al., 1990), and its formation is suggested to cause dramatic weakening of rocks at intermediate to high slip rates (Goldsby and Tullis, 2002). Recent experimental studies report that graphitic carbon exists along fault zones and has a low coefficient of friction perpendicular to the c-axis, and graphitic carbon represents a potential \u201cdry\u201d lubricant in seismic zones during fault motion (e.g., Oohashi et al., 2011, 2014). Graphitic carbon grains connected to ASRR-FZ tend to be distributed along the mylonitic foliation (Fig. 5) in ductile shear zones represented by the microstructural characteristics of ordered flaky graphite sheets in mylonitic schists, or to be just enriched in slip-planes or micro-shear zones of brittle faults, performed as slip on the basal plane perpendicular to the c-axis (Fig. 6). The occurrence of graphitic carbon causes weakening of rocks and makes it easier to slip along the mylonitic foliation of plastic shear zones or fault gouge of brittle faults. Krabbendam et al. (2003) studied the role of dispersed graphite grain sizes range from 5 to 40\u00a0\u03bcm in high-grade mylonites and suggested that the graphite grain size also plays a role in its mode of deformation (Puelles et al., 2014). In our study, samples also show the tendency of being fine-grained in micro-shear zones. The long axis and short axis of graphitic carbon grains are 2\u201320\u00a0\u03bcm and 1\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. But flaky graphitic carbon aggregates in Type I sample AL0061-2 only show characteristics of bending or kink bands. Additionally, small graphite particles (<5\u00a0\u03bcm) occur as inclusions within quartz grains or microfractures, showing a near equidimensional shape and undeformed features. As to graphitic marble, graphite occurs in non-mylonitic marbles as coarse grains (ca. 10\u00a0\u03bcm large hexagonal prisms), forms elongate streaks of fragmented particles in protomylonite, or further fragments and produces extremely small particles in mylonite (Kretz, 1996).\nWhat's more, graphite LPO development is also a potential mechanism for rheological weakening of a rock and to initiate localized shear zones (Tommasi et al., 2009; Hansen et al., 2016; Cao and Neubauer, 2016). Previous study on natural ductility of deformed graphite LPO by EBSD and the LPO patterns of graphite in mylonites recorded the basal <a> and prism <a> slip system. The basal <a> slip coincides with the observed orientation (in XZ thin sections) of mica and graphite flakes parallel to the foliation. Additionally, the basal <a> slip and concomitant recovery, and frictional sliding on internal surfaces are important mechanisms of graphite deformation (e.g., Paterson and Edmond, 1972). Interpretation of prism <a> slip is not a known graphite intracrystalline slip systems or its expected mechanical behavior. Puelles et al. (2014) ascribed this pattern to the macroscopic flow plane or alignment parallel to grain boundaries oriented at a high angles with respect to the foliation. But in our study, graphite shows a strong slip system with basal <a>, rhomb <a> and even prism <a>slip, which are not EBSD indexation artifacts, since they are repeated in different samples. Combined with Raman temperature results, we firstly find the change of graphite LPO is not random but qualitatively organized with temperature changes. The LPO patterns of graphite in different rocks from medium-to lower-grade metamorphic zones of faults also show varieties like crystallographic fabric patterns of quartz with temperature change, which let us consider if the change of graphite LPOs can be one of the tools to indicate the temperature of deformation.\n\n\n\n10\nConclusions\nDeformed graphitic carbon-bearing rocks in the ASRR-FZ have experienced strong plastic to brittle deformation in medium-to low-grade metamorphic rocks, accompanied by grain-size reduction, development of LPOs and micro-shear zones and slip-planes. The LPO patterns and mechanism of graphitic carbon present dislocation varieties from creep base <a>, rhomb <a> to prism <a> slip with temperature rise. The peak temperatures calibrated by all Raman spectra are 350\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C, and are 604\u2013432\u00a0\u00b0C in Type I medium-grade metamorphosed and\/or strongly deformed rocks, 540\u2013350\u00a0\u00b0C in Type II low-grade metamorphism and\/or deformed rocks and 397\u2013357\u00a0\u00b0C in Type III lower-grade metamorphosed and weakly deformed or even undeformed rocks. The graphitic carbon's LPO patterns let us consider that the change of graphite LPOs with increasing temperature can be one of the tools to indicate the temperature. The rheological weakening is constrained by formation of second phases (e.g., graphite) on the microstructural evolution of mineral aggregates associated with strain localization within polymineralic rocks of shear zones.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nMeixia Lyu: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft, All persons who meet authorship criteria are listed as authors, and all authors certify that they have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for the content, including participation in the concept, design, analysis, writing, or revision of the manuscript.

Several studies have demonstrated that pre-existing structures may (i) be subject to reactivation during extension\/shortening (Daly et al., 1989; Theuniseen et al., 1996; Fossen, 2010; Phillips et al., 2016; Fazlikhani et al., 2017), (ii) control the nucleation and localisation of new faults during rifting (Manatschal et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2017; Collagena et al., 2019), (iii) cause stress field perturbation and formation of non-collinear fault networks (Morley et al., 2004; Reeve et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2017; Collagena et al., 2019; Osagiede et al., 2020), (iv) control the segmentation of faults and rift basins (Katumwehe et al., 2015; Rotevatn et al., 2018), (v) influence the length, orientation, spacing and evolution of faults (Fossen and Rotevatn, 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Osagiede et al., 2020), and vi) control the shape and evolution of the necking zones (Manatschal et al., 2015). Improvements in seismic quality and computer capacity during the last two decades have improved imaging of the intra-basement structures in seismic reflection data, the 2D & 3D modelling, and allow identification of how some of these structures control the location, orientation and interaction of rift-related faults (Bird et al., 2015; Manatschal et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Wrona et al., 2019). Some of these seismic studies show that thicker shear zones with a dip >15\u00b0 tend to be reactivated (Phillips et al., 2016; Fazlikhani et al., 2017). Thick shear zones are up to 300\u00a0km thick, up to 50\u00a0km long with displacements up to 10\u00a0km (See by Wrona et al., 2019 for a compilation of outcropped shear zones). Outcrop and seismic studies have shown the geometries of the shear zones in map view and cross-section, but their three-dimension geometry is still unknown. In addition, despite the number of studies devoted to deciphering the interaction between inheritance structures and rift-related faults, these studies have focused primarily on continental rifts and the proximal domains of rifted margins. It is, therefore, largely unknown how inherited structures impact later stages of rifting and passive margin development, including the role of pre-existing fabric in controlling the development of high-displacement (>3\u00a0km), low-angle (<30\u00b0) normal faults.\nLong-lived faults with moderate to low-angle dip and tens of kilometres displacement delimit the different structural domains along-and-across strike of rifted margins (Fig. 1\n) (Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018; Ribes et al., 2019). Highly extended terranes, such as metamorphic core complexes or hyperextended margins, have given insight into the behaviour of these faults (Davis, 1980; Lister et al., 1986; Andersen and Jamtveir, 1990; Malavieille, 1993; Davis et al., 2002; Axen, 2004; Manatschal, 2004; Sutra and Manatschal, 2012; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013). Based on some of these studies and seismic examples of the Norwegian passive margin, Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018) name the low-angle, highly-displacement faults as High-\u03b2 faults, and classified them in three types regarding deformation processes and the thickness of the continental crust (Fig. 1). (i) High-\u03b2 \u2018type 0\u2019 faults (type HB0 late-to post-orogenic detachment) are detachment faults associated with the evolution of metamorphic core complexes and supradetachment basins generated during late-to post-contractional stages of the Caledonian orogenic events, which are now preserved in the proximal domains of the margin (Braathen et al., 2000; Fossen, 2010; Gee et al., 2010; Corfu et al., 2014). These faults display listric, subhorizontal or convex geometries in cross-section with displacements of up to 100\u00a0km. (ii) High-\u03b2 \u2018type 1\u2019 faults (type HB1: coupling detachment) are faults related to the crustal thinning in the necking domain of rifted margins. These faults have planar, listric or ramp-flat geometries, dips of 0\u201345\u00b0 and displacements of 20\u00a0km\u201330\u00a0km in cross-section. Geometry variation along strike depends on the thickness, thermal state, composition and presence of ductile layers within the continental crust, and hence the efficiency of the coupling process between the continental crust and mantle (Manatschal et al., 2015; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018). (iii) High-\u03b2 \u2018type 2\u2019 faults (type HB2: exhumation detachment) are low angle (<30\u00b0) faults with listric, horizontal to convex-upwards geometries in cross-section. These faults are located in the distal domains of hyperextended rifted margins and have displacement up to 100\u00a0km.\nThis paper builds on the work of Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018), investigating how inherited basement structures controlled the location, geometry, orientation and segmentation of High-\u03b2 \u2018type 1\u2019 fault complexes developed during later rift phases within a thick continental crust (>25\u00a0km). To do this, we focus on the southern part of the Klakk Fault Complex (Klakk FC), which is located in the southern transition between the M\u00f8re and V\u00f8ring margin segments of the Norwegian Passive Margin (Mosar, 2003) (Fig. 2\na). The Klakk FC separated the Fr\u00f8ya High-Sklinna Ridge in its footwall from the R\u00e5s Basin in its hanging wall during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous rifting episodes (Fig. 2b). The Klakk FC is associated with a thinning of the continental crust from c. 30\u00a0km to c. 10\u00a0km, and thus, a crustal wedge geometry (Fig. 2c) (Osmundsen et al., 2002; Osmundsen and Redfield, 2011; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018). We constructed a 3D structural model of Klakk FC and surrounding area, integrating and interpreting 3D and 2D seismic reflection, well and potential field data to the west of the Fr\u00f8ya High (Fig. 2b). We show that the Klakk FC comprises N-S striking non-collinear fault complex, which has planar, listric and convex geometries in cross-section, with displacements of 17\u00a0km\u201334\u00a0km. We map several discrete basement structures and elucidate the controls they exerted on the geometry and evolution of the Klakk FC. The high quality seismic, with good imaging of structures to 10\u00a0s TWT depth, combined with the potential field data available, make this area a locality type for the study of High-\u03b2 \u2018type 1\u2019 faults within a thick continental crust.\n\n\n2\nStructural style of rifted margins\nThe structural configuration of a typical rifted margin is composed of proximal, necking, distal, outer and oceanic domains (Fig. 1) (Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013). Proximal domains are characterised by low values of extension where a continental crust exceeds 30\u00a0km thickness. Faults show steeply-dipping planar to listric geometries (low-\u03b2 faults) that define half-grabens (Gawthorpe et al., 2000; Manatschal, 2004; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018). Necking domains display a continental crust wedge shape (>10\u00a0km to\u00a0<\u00a030\u00a0km) in cross-section, which is produced by rapid strain localisation onto High-\u03b2 \u2018type 1\u2019 faults (Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Naliboff et al., 2017). High-\u03b2 \u2018type 1\u2019 faults developed in a thick continental crust with a steep geothermal gradient may generate CMCC in the necking domains (Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018). The distal domain is an area where extension affects a continental crust that is less than 10\u00a0km thick. It is divided into two subdomains, hyperextended and exhumed (Fig. 1) (Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013). Sag-basin types characterise this domain, where the footwall size decreases oceanward (Fig. 1) (Manatschal, 2004; Sutra et al., 2013). The High-\u03b2 faults that limit the different structural domains have been denominated as breakaway complexes (Fig. 1). (i) proximal breakaway complex limits the non-rifted area from the proximal domain; (ii) inner necking breakaway complex separates the proximal domain from the necking domain; (iii) outer necking breakaway complex delimits the necking domain from the distal domain; (iv) distal breakaway complex limits the hyperextended subdomain from the exhumed subdomain; and (v) outer breakaway complex bounds the exhumed subdomain from the outer domain. In this paper, and following Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018), the terms inner necking, outer necking, and combined inner and outer necking breakaway complexes are used to describe the High-\u03b2 \u2018type 1\u2019 faults that interact in the necking domain.\n\n\n3\nIntra-basement structures\nInherited structures in continental rifts and rifted margins are generally defined as pre-rift basement structures such as continental metamorphic core complexes, continental supradetachment basins, shear zones, ancient thrust or normal faults, and pervasive basement fabrics (e.g. Reeve et al., 2014; Phillips et al., 2016; Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019). High-displacement normal faults may exhume rocks from the middle and lower continental crust generating continental metamorphic core complexes in areas where the continental crust is more than 30\u00a0km thick (Davis, 1980; Wernicke, 1981; Serenne and Seguret, 1987). These metamorphic core complexes tend to display elongate domal geometries with major axis parallel or perpendicular to the extension direction, or hyperbolic geometries with marked asymmetries parallel and perpendicular to the extension direction (Jolivet et al., 2010; Wiest et al., 2019). Metamorphic core complexes have been divided into continental core complexes (CCC), continental margin core complexes (CMCC) and oceanic core complexes based on the thickness or absence of continental crust (Whitney et al., 2013). Supradetachment basins form above high-displacement normal faults, and they record the evolution of the highly extended terranes (Friedmann and Burbank, 1995; Osmundsen et al., 1998; Vetti and Fossen, 2012).\nShear zones form tabular zones from cms to several kms thickness and up to 100\u00a0s\u00a0km in length, which can accommodate large amounts of strain during extension, shortening and\/or strike-slip movement (Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017; Wrona et al., 2019). Detachment zones are shear zones that flatten into the brittle-ductile transition zone. Shear zones in seismic images can be identified based on three geometries: multiple inclined reflections, converging reflections and cross-cutting reflections (Wrona et al., 2019). Such geometries may, however, also represent layered basement, metamorphosed sedimentary rocks, or magmatic intrusions, which adds uncertainty to the seismic interpretation (Phillips et al., 2016; Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Wrona et al., 2019). Despite shear zones having been recognised in outcrop and seismic images (Fossen, 2010; Phillips et al., 2016; Wiest et al., 2019; Osagiede et al., 2020), their 3D geometry has not been well identified, because it may display a combination of highs and lows, in both sense, parallel or perpendicular to the movement direction (Lenhart et al., 2019; Wiest et al., 2019). Improvements in the acquisition and computational power have been increasing the quality of the recent reflection seismic surveys. They may illuminate metamorphic core complexes, supradetachment basins, shear zones and pre-existing faulting as part of the intra-basement structures (Reeve et al., 2014; Bird et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016; Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Collagena et al., 2019; Lenhart et al., 2019; Trice et al., 2019; Osagiede et al., 2020).\n\n\n4\nGeological background\nThe Norwegian passive margin has a NE-SW to N-S trend, with three dominant NW-SE-trending fracture zones (Jan Mayen, Bivrost and Senja) that divide the rifted margin into three main segments: M\u00f8re, V\u00f8ring and Lofoten-Vester\u00e5len (Fig. 2a) (Blystad et al., 1995; Mosar, 2003; Faleide et al., 2008, 2010; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Osmundsen et al., 2016; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018).\n\n4.1\nRegional tectonics\nThe closure of the Iapetus Ocean during the Ordovician and the subsequent oblique continent-continent collision between Laurentia and Baltica during the Silurian resulted in the culmination of the Caledonian orogeny (Torsvik and Cocks, 2005; Gee et al., 2013). This mountain belt featured major thrust and nappe units with an overall eastward to southeastward vergence that involved rocks from Baltica, Laurentia, Iapetus Ocean and exotic, predominantly island arc terrains (Gee et al., 2010, 2013; Corfu et al., 2014). The onshore geology in Western Norway offers insight into the Caledonian basement structure and composition, which acted as a \u2018structural template\u2019 for later rifting (Fossen, 2010; Chenin et al., 2015; Lenhart et al., 2019; Schiffer et al., 2019).\nPost-orogenic collapse, from 403 to 380\u00a0Ma (Fossen, 2000, 2010), generated a series of continental core complex-style basement culminations along the Norwegian margin, including the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) and the Central Norwegian Basement Window (CNBW) (Fig. 2a and b and ) (Braathen et al., 2000; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Osmundsen et al., 2006; Fossen, 2010; Andersen et al., 2012; Corfu et al., 2014; Fossen et al., 2016). Orogenic collapse also led to the formation of a series of extensional detachments that bounded intra-montane Devonian collapse basins (Braathen et al., 2000; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Osmundsen et al., 2006). Examples of these extensional detachment shear zones include the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment Zone, which bound the Solund, Kvamshesten, H\u00e5steinen and Hornelen basins in the WGR, and the H\u00f8ybakken Detachment, which bounds the \u2018Old Red Sandstone\u2019 basins in the CNBW (Fig. 2b) (Braathen et al., 2000, 2002; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Eide et al., 2005; Skilbrei and Olesen, 2005; Osmundsen et al., 2006; Corfu et al., 2014; Fossen et al., 2016; Lenhart et al., 2019).\n\nP\u00e9ron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen (2018) suggest that the prolonged, multi-phase rifting history of the mid-Norwegian margin was the result of the interaction between four deformation phases: stretching, thinning, exhumation-hyperextension and oceanisation-break up. The first rifting phase (stretching) includes mild rifting episodes during the mid-Carboniferous and a more significant rifting episode during the Permian- Lower Triassic (Blystad et al., 1995; Dor\u00e9 et al., 1999; Faleide et al., 2010; Tsikalas et al., 2012). Widespread extension created half-grabens with preferential NNE and NE strike during this episode, now preserved in the proximal domain (e.g. Froan Basin and Tr\u00f8ndelag Platform) (Fig. 2b) (Blystad et al., 1995; Dor\u00e9 et al., 1999; M\u00fcller et al., 2005; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013). The second rifting phase (thinning) consists of mild rifting events during the early Jurassic focused on the Halten Terrace, and a major rifting episode during the latest Middle Jurassic to Late Jurassic, which localised on the boundary between the Tr\u00f8ndelag Platform and the R\u00e5s and Tr\u00e6na basins. This rift phase caused high-\u03b2 faults to form (e.g. Klakk FC, Bremstein Fault Complex, Ytreholmen Fault Complex and Vingleia Fault Complex) and, consequently, the wedge-shaped crustal geometry of the necking domain in cross-section (Figs. 1 and 2) (Dor\u00e9 et al., 1999; Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008; Elliott et al., 2012; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Bell et al., 2014; Ravn\u00e5s et al., 2014). The third rifting phase (exhumation-hyperextension) was a major rifting event during the earliest Cretaceous and a middle Cretaceous mild rifting (Blystad et al., 1995; Dor\u00e9 et al., 1997, 1999; Faleide et al., 2010; P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2018). Extension during this phase was focused mainly on the R\u00e5s Basin and created hyperextended and sag basins, with associated mantle exhumation and serpentinisation (Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Osmundsen et al., 2016; P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2018). The fourth rifting phase (oceanisation-break up) involved major rifting during the Late Cretaceous-earliest Eocene (Blystad et al., 1995; Dor\u00e9 et al., 1999; Faleide et al., 2010; Gernigon et al., 2012; P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2018). Extension in this phase localised mainly in the distal domain, producing the M\u00f8re and V\u00f8ring marginal highs, and ultimately leading to a continental breakup between c. 52 to 49\u00a0Ma (Gernigon et al., 2012). The margins currently display an NW tilting because of thermal subsidence since the middle Cretaceous (Bell et al., 2014).\n\n\n4.2\nStudy area\n\n4.2.1\nStructures\nThis paper focuses on the area around the boundary between the M\u00f8re and the V\u00f8ring Basins, one of the boundaries between two of the Norwegian margin mega-segments. We focus on the area around the Fr\u00f8ya High, specifically the Klakk FC. This fault complex separates the Fr\u00f8ya High in its footwall from the R\u00e5s Basin in its hanging wall, which was active during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous rifting episodes (Figs. 2 and 3\n) (Blystad et al., 1995; Faleide et al., 2010; Osmundsen et al., 2016). The Klakk FC has an overall N-S strike and is c. 270\u00a0km long. The Klakk FC has a westward dip and features heaves of 10\u201315\u00a0km (Blystad et al., 1995; Osmundsen et al., 2016; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018). Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018) suggest that the Klakk FC represents a combined inner and outer necking breakaway complex along the Fr\u00f8ya High, whereas this fault complex represents the outer necking breakaway zone in the Sklinna Ridge area (Fig. 2b).\nThe Klakk FC interacts southwards with the Jan Mayen Lineament (JML) and the M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Complex (MTFC) (Fig. 2a and b and ). The JML represents the southwestward continuation of the sinistral NW-SE trending Jan Mayen transform fault system, and it separates the M\u00f8re Basin from the V\u00f8ring Basin, Halten Terrace and Fr\u00f8ya High (Fig. 2a and b and ) (Blystad et al., 1995). The MTFC separates the northern Viking Graben from the M\u00f8re Margin (Gabrielsen et al., 1999; Nasuti et al., 2012). The down-to-the-NW MTFC strikes ENE to NE, is c. 750 long, and is composed of several fault segments in a zone up to c. 80\u00a0km wide. Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018) define the southeastern strand of the MTFC in the M\u00f8re margin segment as the proximal breakaway complex, whereas the northwestern strand comprises the outer necking breakaway complex (Fig. 2b and c and ). This fault complex underwent dextral movement during the Silurian (Seranne, 1992; Dor\u00e9 et al., 1997), sinistral movement during the Devonian (Seranne, 1992; Braathen et al., 2000; Osmundsen et al., 2006), and several brittle dip-slip to oblique-slip and dextral displacement events since the late Palaeozoic (Braathen et al., 2002; Redfield et al., 2005).\nThe Klakk FC interacts northwards with the Vingleia Fault Complex (VFC). The NE-trending VFC separates the Fr\u00f8ya High from the Halten Terrace to the north (Fig. 2b). The VFC was active during the Triassic, with major displacement accommodation during the main late Jurassic and early Cretaceous rifting phases (Ravn\u00e5s et al., 2014; Elliott et al., 2015; Osmundsen et al., 2016). The Vingleia Fault Complex joins the N-S trending Bremstein Fault Complex towards the northeast, where it is the inner necking breakaway complex of the V\u00f8ring margin segment (Fig. 2a and b and ) (Osmundsen et al., 2016; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018).\n\n\n4.2.2\nBasement lithologies\nThe Central Norway Basement Window (CNBW) and the Fr\u00f8ya High are part of the same crystalline basement, based on the similarity in both their exhumation ages and geophysical characteristics (Skilbrei et al., 2002; Eide et al., 2005; Osmundsen et al., 2005). The CNBW, therefore, is an onshore analogue for the Fr\u00f8ya High. The CNBW is a continental core complex that was uplifted by the interplay of the MTFC with the H\u00f8ybakken and the Kolstraumen detachments during the orogenic-collapse, c. 400-365\u00a0Ma (Braathen et al., 2000, 2002; Kendrick et al., 2004; Eide et al., 2005; Osmundsen et al., 2006). Proterozoic crystalline rocks overlain by a thin folded layer of rocks of the Seve Nappe (Middle Allochthon) represent the lower plate, whereas upper-, uppermost-allochthon rocks (Caledonian intrusions, supracrustal rocks) and Upper Devonian \u2018Old Red sandstone\u2019 basins composes the upper plate of the continental core complex (Fig. 2) (Eide et al., 2005; Gee et al., 2010; Corfu et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2015). Four boreholes have drilled the basement on the Fr\u00f8ya High with granite crystalline basement being reported. Core into the basement (2972\u00a0m\u20132672.6\u00a0m) was recovered from borehole 6407\/10-3. Slagstad et al. (2011) classify a sample from this core as a fine-cal-alkaline granite of syn-collisional volcanic arc affinity, with a crystallisation age of 437\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma using U-Pb in zircons. In addition, they propose that these rocks are part of the uppermost allochthones of the Caledonian nappe and correlate them with the granite rocks outcropped at Sm\u00f8la and Hitra islands. Eide et al. (2005) determine an exhumation age of 377\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4\u00a0Ma for the same core using 40Ar\/39Ar method, which is similar to the ages reported for the H\u00f8ybakken detachment using the same dating method (Kendrick et al., 2004).\nThe Fr\u00f8ya High is covered by several geophysical surveys, including potential fields and seismic reflection data. The Fr\u00f8ya High is characterised by strong positive magnetic and gravity anomalies (>1200\u00a0nT and >60 mGal, respectively) (Fig. 3) (Skilbrei et al., 2002; Skilbrei and Olesen, 2005; Olesen et al., 2010, 2010b; Maystrenko et al., 2018). Gravity anomaly values in the Fr\u00f8ya High may reflect a high-density lower-crustal granulite layer (Mjelde et al., 2016; Maystrenko et al., 2018), or Precambrian rocks similar to the CNBW with intrusions of Caledonian plutons (Skilbrei and Olesen, 2005). The magnetic anomaly has been interpreted as a highly uplifted granitic to dioritic crystalline Precambrian rock based on a correlation with onshore rocks (Skilbrei et al., 2002; Skilbrei and Olesen, 2005; Maystrenko et al., 2018). Seismic data reveal an intra-basement antiformal structure underneath the Vingleia Fault Complex (VFC), which has been interpreted as a Palaeozoic shear zone (Osmundsen et al., 2002, 2005, 2016; Skilbrei and Olesen, 2005). Outcrops, boreholes, potential field and seismic data, therefore, suggest that both, the CBNW and the Fr\u00f8ya High are continental core complexes generated by orogenic collapse during the Devonian (Osmundsen et al., 2005).\n\n\n\n\n5\nData and methods\n\n5.1\nData\nWe use information from four boreholes that penetrated the basement rocks of the Fr\u00f8ya High, six 3D seismic surveys (4438\u00a0km2), a selection of 2D lines from eleven seismic surveys (11148\u00a0km total length), and the gravity anomaly and magnetic anomaly maps of Olesen et al., 2010 and Olesen et al. (2010b) (Figs. 2 and 3 and Tables 1 and 2\n\n). Seismic surveys recorded information to maximum depths of five and 10\u00a0s TWT. These data were processed in zero-phase and are displayed here in reverse polarity (Society of Exploration Geophysicists [SEG]). Black colour reflections (peak) in the seismic sections represents an increase in acoustic impedance, while red colour reflection (trough) denotes a decrease in acoustic impedance.\n\n\n5.2\nMethods\nWe integrated and interpreted the seismic data and well information in Petrel 2016 for software), and we used structural smoothing attribute to reduce the noise-signal ratio in the seismic data. This attribute improves the continuity of basement reflections. VSP data of each well was used to tie the geological data with the seismic data (Table 1). The top of the acoustic basement is characterised by a high-amplitude peak reflection (e.g. Fig. 5a and b and \n). Fault geometries were defined using the methodology by Shaw et al. (2004), which is based on (i) direct fault-plane reflections, produced by changes in acoustic impedance across and within fault zones, (ii) terminations of fold limbs or kink bands, and (iii) fault cutoffs (terminations of reflections or abrupt changes of reflection attributes at the fault surface). Fault planes were mapped using the fault interpretation strategies described by Tearpock and Bischke (2003). We classified intra-basement reflectivity into different seismic facies based on amplitude, geometry and continuity characteristics. The contacts and overall geometry of these seismic facies were identified and mapped to define the geometry of intra-basement structures. Comparison between different overlapping 2D and 3D surveys allowed recognition of geophysical artefacts (Fazlikhani et al., 2017). The layer cake methodology by Marsden (1989) was used for depth conversion using Move software. We calculated average velocities from VSP reports from the Cenozoic and Upper Cretaceous succession. The velocities reported for the V\u00f8ring and M\u00f8re basins for the Lower Cretaceous and older rocks were also used (Table 3\n) (Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008). The velocity analysis to quantify the uncertainty of the depth conversions is included in Supplement 1. The \u2018best-fit depth conversion\u2019 shows good match (\u00b15%) with well tops in the Fr\u00f8ya High and the R\u00e5s Basin (Supplement 1). In the deep parts of the basins, where there is a lack of well control, the acoustic basement sits at c. 12.7\u201314.4\u00a0km depth. The values reported in the results for faults dip angles, have an uncertainty that increases with depth. For listric faults that flatten with depth, we estimate a maximum uncertainty of \u00b15\u00b0 relative to the reported values. We added the geophysical Moho map by Maystrenko et al. (2018) to the depth converted sections (Fig. 5). Crustal thinning cannot be reliably calculated, since (i) the geophysical Moho may not match with the lithological Moho (P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2016), and (ii) the Klakk FC's footwall is extensively degraded\/eroded. Therefore, the values calculated between the top acoustic basement and geophysical Moho surfaces represent syn-rift basement thinning.\n\n\n\n6\nGeometry and structure of the Klakk Fault Complex\nThe down-to-the-west Klakk FC is an N-S non-collinear fault complex composed of several fault segments that delineate two structural salients and two structural recesses (Fig. 4a and c, 4d). The Klakk FC has significant along-strike variability in cross-section, exhibiting overall low-angle, planar to listric geometries with heaves ranging from c. 17\u00a0km to c. 34\u00a0km (Figs. 5\u20139\n\n\n\n and Table 4\n). Post-rift thermal subsidence rotated the Fr\u00f8ya High towards the NW (Bell et al., 2014). Consequently, present-day measured dips represent maximum values and are different from the fault dips during faulting. Fig. 5 shows the fault geometry in the depth domain, while Figs. 6\u20139 are in the time domain. Although cross-sections A to D are in the depth and time domains and located in the same area (Fig. 4), there is a lateral shift between them (Fig. 4a). The cross-sections in the depth domain focus on the fault geometry and are shifted towards the west, while cross-sections in the time domain show the intra-basement structures in the footwall principally and are shifted to the east.\nThe central structural salient has a NW-SE trend, while the northern structural salient exhibits an E-W trend (Fig. 4). The central structural salient is a prominent structural feature and shows an arc geometry in map view (Fig. 4b). This salient is c. 40\u00a0km wide and displays a convex-westwards geometry with a diameter of c. 34\u00a0km in map view (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4a shows that this arc is highly eroded with the prominent development of canyons that truncates the fault scarp of the Klakk FC. The Klakk FC surrounds this structural salient, and this fault complex changes its strike direction around the salient, from NW-SE in the south west, to NNE-SSW toward the west and to E-W to ENE-SWS towards the north (Fig. 4a). Section C-C\u2032 shows a planar geometry, with dips of c. 13\u00b0 and a minimum heave of c. 32\u00a0km towards the west of the central structural salient (Fig. 8). The fault scarp on the central structural salient displays a concave-downward geometry, as shown in the dip and strike cross-sections (Fig. 5c and e, 8). The continental crust has a thickness of c. 24\u00a0km in the footwall and c. 11\u00a0km in the hanging wall in the central structural salient area (Fig. 5b). We, therefore, calculate a minimum syn-rift basement thinning of c. 13\u00a0km in the west. The northern salient is c. 27\u00a0km long and c. 17\u00a0km wide (Fig. 4a and b and ). Two fault segments with an N-S strike connected by a NE-SW fault are localised to the west of the northern structural high (Fig. 4a). Section A-A\u2019 shows that the Klakk FC displays a single listric fault plane with a rider block and limited footwall scarp erosion in cross-section (Figs. 5a and 6). The upper part of the fault dips c. 44\u00b0, shallowing to c. 23\u00b0 with depth and has a minimum heave of c. 16.8\u00a0km (Fig. 5a and Table 4). The continental crust has a thickness of c. 26.4\u00a0km on the Fr\u00f8ya High and c. 13.5\u00a0km in the hanging wall cut-off (Fig. 5a and Table 4). Consequently, we calculated a minimum syn-rift basement thinning of c. 13\u00a0km to the west in the northern structural salient area (Fig. 5a).\nThe structural recesses display a significant change in the structural configuration in both map and cross-section concerning the structural salients (Figs. 4 and 5). The central structural recess has a convex eastwards geometry in map view, and it cuts c. 23\u00a0km into the high (Fig. 4a and b and ). The central structural recess has an NE-SW eroded ridge that is c. 7\u00a0km long, which divides the central structural recess into two zones, an inner zone in the eastern flank and an outer zone in the western flank (Fig. 5b). The inner zone has down-to-the-west linked fault segments that change their strike direction from NE-SW to NNE-SSW and are 2\u20134\u00a0km long in map view (Fig. 4d). Cross-section B-B\u2032 shows a down-to-the-west fault with a dip of c. 29\u00b0 and minimum heave of c. 2.6\u00a0km (Fig. 5b) and may continue as a detachment fault to merge with the outer breakaway zone. This fault bounds a half-graben basin, which shows a sedimentary filling of c. 1.4\u00a0km thick. Well 6306\/5-2 drilled the upper 12\u00a0m of this structure and found Upper Jurassic sandstones (Fig. 7). The outer zone has three down to the west linked fault segments with a NE-SW strike and are 10\u201312\u00a0km long in map view (Fig. 4a). In the outer zone, section B-B\u2032 shows that the Klakk FC consists of two interacting fault planes, with dips of c. 25\u00b0 and c. 18\u00b0, which create a minimum heave of 25.6\u00a0km, and an eroded fault scarp of c. 5.6\u00a0km long (Figs. 4a, 5b and 7). The thickness of continental crust is c. 25.3\u00a0km in the Fr\u00f8ya High and is c. 11.4\u00a0km in the R\u00e5s Basin (Fig. 5b). Consequently, we calculate a minimum syn-rift basement thinning of c. 13.9\u00a0km in the west of the central structural recess. The seismic information available for this study allows us to evaluate only the northern part of the southern structural recess (Figs. 2, 4b and 5d, 9). In section D-D\u2019, the Klakk FC is a down-to-the-SW fault that strikes NNW-SSE for c. 30\u00a0km in map view, and it interacts with the fault located to the west of the central structural salient (Fig. 4a). In this cross-section, the Klakk FC has a listric geometry, where the upper part of the fault dips c. 44\u00b0 dip shallowing to c. 9\u00b0 dip with depth, and its scarp is affected by degradation\/erosion approximately 4\u00a0km into the footwall. We calculate, therefore, a minimum heave of c. 20\u00a0km. The continental crust is c. 24.3\u00a0km in the Fr\u00f8ya High and is c. 11.9\u00a0km in the R\u00e5s Basin in cross-section (Fig. 5d). It suggests a syn-rift basement thinning of 12.4\u00a0km in the west of this section.\n\n\n7\nCharacterisation of the crystalline basement\n\n7.1\nPotential fields signature of the Fr\u00f8ya High\nThe Fr\u00f8ya High is characterised with overall high positive gravity (c. 60 mGal) and magnetic (c. 1200\u00a0nT) anomalies, that do not coincide spatially with each other (Fig. 3). The high positive gravity anomaly is localised above the central structural salient and towards the west of the central structural recess (Fig. 3a). The high gravity anomaly is comprised of three partly overlapping domal anomalies with a clover leaf-like geometry, covering an area of c. 40\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0km. In cross-section, the gravity anomalies tend to follow the geometry of the Klakk FC and the Mandel Basin (Figs. 7\u20139), except in section A-A\u2019 where the gravity anomaly has a flat response on the Klakk FC (Fig. 6). Similar high positive gravity values offshore are reported on the Gossa High (c. 50 mGal), to the north of the Sm\u00f8la island (c. 60 mGal) and to the west of Molde-Hustad area (c. 70 mGal) (Fig. 3a). The high magnetic anomaly is the highest in the mid-Norwegian margin and is located on the northern structural salient and towards the east of the central structural recess (Fig. 3b). It covers an area of c. 55\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a033\u00a0km. We do not observe a relationship between the magnetic anomaly and the Klakk FC on cross-sections A to D (Figs. 6\u20139). Other positive high magnetic anomalies offshore are located towards the north of the Fr\u00f8ya High (c. 400\u00a0nT) and towards the northeast of the Sl\u00f8rebotn Subbasin (c. 300\u00a0nT) (Fig. 3b).\n\nFig. 3 shows the potential field responses in the offshore and onshore areas around the Fr\u00f8ya High. We identify an elongate positive gravity anomaly with a NE-SW direction and c. 55 mGal on the CNBW. This anomaly is limited to the south and west by the H\u00f8ybakken detachment (Fig. 3a). High positive magnetic values are also recorded on Proterozoic crystalline rocks in the western part of the CNBW (c. 400\u00a0nT) and around the Hustad area (c. 300\u00a0nT) (Fig. 3b).\n\n\n7.2\nBasement seismic facies\nChanges in acoustic impedance, related to lithological or structural heterogeneity can cause local changes in amplitude at depth within the basement (Phillips et al., 2016; Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019). Although different acquisition and processing parameters in various 2D and 3D seismic surveys produce variations in frequency and amplitude, we used two techniques to identified geophysical artefacts. First, the presence of consistent seismic facies in different surveys located in the same area allows us to separate real reflections from geophysical artefacts with reasonable confidence (Fazlikhani et al., 2017). Second, we converted selected seismic sections to the depth domain (Fig. 5) to identify whether velocities changes caused the intra-basement geometries. These seismic sections preserved the intra-basement geometries, confirming that they are not geophysical artefacts.\nWe identify five seismic facies (SF1 to SF5) within the footwall of the Klakk FC based on amplitude, internal reflective character, and geometry of intra-basement reflections (Fig. 10\n).\n\n7.2.1\nSeismic facies 1 (SF1)\n\nObservations: SF1 consist of moderately continuous, divergent, subparallel to oblique reflection geometries that have high to medium amplitudes (Fig. 10a). SF1 occurs in the northern part of the southern structural recess, between the Klakk FC and the Mandel Basin (Figs. 9 and 11\n). The location of this seismic facies coincides with the location of a magnetic low (Fig. 9). The upper boundary of SF1 is the top of the acoustic basement horizon and it passes down into SF4 or SF3.\n\nInterpretation: SF1 shows similar characteristics to the seismic facies defined by Mitchum et al. (1977) for sedimentary rocks. Since no wells have penetrated this seismic facies, the sedimentary affinity of this succession cannot be determined with certainty. SF1 does, however, share characteristics and geometries with the intra-basement \u2018SF1\u2019 described by Lenhart et al. (2019) and the \u2018Seismic Facies 1\u2019 described by Fazlikhani et al. (2017), who both suggest that this type of seismic facies likely represent Devonian sedimentary basins.\n\n\n7.2.2\nSeismic facies 2 (SF2)\n\nObservations: SF2 is largely reflection-free with subtle internal areas of low to medium amplitude discontinues to chaotic reflections (Fig. 10b). SF2 occurs in the central and northern part of the Fr\u00f8ya High in map view, and it tends to die-out to some reflection of SF3 to the west (Figs. 6\u20138). The upper boundary of SF2 is the top of the acoustic basement reflection and it passes downward into SF4 in the central and west part of the Fr\u00f8ya high in map view. Boreholes 6306\/6-1 and 6306\/6-2 penetrate SF2 reporting rocks of granitic composition (Fig. 4a and Table 1).\n\nInterpretations: The 6306\/6-1 and 6306\/6-2 wells reported weathered granite rocks. SF2 coincides with the location of the irregular oval-like positive magnetic anomaly. This high magnitude anomaly has been interpreted as uplifted highly magnetic Precambrian granitic to granodioritic rocks (Skilbrei et al., 2002; Skilbrei and Olesen, 2005; Maystrenko et al., 2018). We, therefore, interpret SF2 as a lithological unit, related to the exhumed Baltic basement.\n\n\n7.2.3\nSeismic facies 3 (SF3)\n\nObservations: SF3 comprises moderate to high amplitude reflections with overall semi-continuous braided to inclined geometries gathered in tabular bands (Figs. 10c and 6 to 9). SF3 generally features antiformal shapes in the immediate footwall of the Klakk FC between 3.0 and 5.5\u00a0s TWT (Figs. 6\u20139). The upper and west boundary of SF3 is the eroded fault scarp or top of the acoustic basement; the east boundary is the SF2, and SF3 passes down into SF4.\n\nInterpretation: SF3 has not been penetrated by wellbores. Although SF3 has not been described as an intra-basement seismic facies in other publications, similar reflection geometries have been reported in the Norwegian Sea, Uruguay, the Barents Sea, the North Sea, Vietnam and New Zealand, where they have been interpreted as rift-related shear zones (Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Clerc et al., 2015, 2018; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018; Henstra et al., 2019; Phillips and McCaffrey, 2019). We interpret that the SF3 corresponds to shear zones related to the high-displacement faults (thinning phase) based on the location and the similarity with rift-related shear zones. We observe that SF3 is not connected with SF4 (Figs. 4 and 14, 15). This observation leads us to the interpretation that these seismic facies are not related to one and the same structure. We discuss this in section 8.1.3.\n\n\n7.2.4\nSeismic facies 4 (SF4)\n\nObservations: SF4 is characterised by high to very high amplitude grouped together in tabular bands with continuous reflections that have internal multiple inclined or converging geometries (Figs. 10d and 6 to 9). The tabular bands of SF4 are 0.5\u20131.5\u00a0s thick and tend to generate a major anticline towards the east of the central structural salient and central and southern recesses (Figs. 7\u20139). The upper boundary of SF4 is SF1, SF2 and SF3. In some places, SF4 mixes or merges with SF3. SF4 passes gradually down into SF5.\n\nInterpretation: SF4 is similar to \u2018Seismic facies 2\u2032 of Fazlikhani et al. (2017), \u2018SF3\u2019 of Lenhart et al. (2019) in the northern Viking Graben, which are inferred to be associated with Devonian shear zones. In addition, SF4 has similar characteristics and geometries to the Palaeozoic detachment interpreted by Osmundsen et al. (2002) below the Vingleia Fault Complex and Tr\u00f8ndelag Platform (Fig. 2). The three papers mentioned above all suggest that these Devonian shear zones are a continuation of onshore shear zones generated during the orogenic collapse of the Caledonian orogen. Based on the seismic facies similarities, the location and the presence of Devonian shear zones in the area, we propose that SF4 represents an inherited Devonian shear zone.\n\n\n7.2.5\nSeismic facies 5 (SF5)\n\nObservations: SF5 occurs in the deepest part of the seismic data, generally below the six to 7\u00a0s TWT, and it composed of high amplitude discontinuous to chaotic reflections (Figs. 6\u20139).\n\nInterpretation: This seismic facies is similar to \u2018SF4\u2019 of Lenhart et al. (2019), who suggest it is representing the Baltic basement. We therefore suggest that SF5 represents the lower continental crust, which is composed of reworked Baltic basement similar to the exhumed basement in the WGR or CNBW (Braathen et al., 2000; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Osmundsen et al., 2006; Fossen, 2010; Andersen et al., 2012; Corfu et al., 2014; Fossen et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n7.3\nGeometry of intra-basement reflective packages\nThree distinct intra-basement structures have been identified based on the geometry of reflections and arrangement of seismic facies: (i) a bowl-shaped structure that contain the SF1 seismic facies, (ii) a hyperbolic structure associated to SF4 reflectivity, and (iii) a dome structure generated for SF3 reflections in the immediate footwall of the Klakk FC (Figs. 11\u201315\n\n\n\n).\n\n7.3.1\nBowl-shaped structure related to SF1\nA bowl-shaped structure below the immediate acoustic top basement has a WNW-ESE direction and an area of c. 25\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a022\u00a0km (Fig. 11). This structure is located in the west of the Fr\u00f8ya High, between the central structural salient and southern recess (Fig. 11a). The spoon-shaped structure contains reflections of SF1 and is c. 12\u00a0km long and c. 0.36\u00a0s TWT thick (c. 1\u00a0km) in section F-F\u2019 (Fig. 11c). The basin has depositional contact with the top basement reflection. The band with SF4 has a ramp-flat-ramp geometry c. 6.5\u00a0s TWT below the spoon-shaped structure. The seismic facies in this structure differs from seismic facies in the Mandel Basin. SF1 shows an oblique geometry, while in the Mandel Basin, reflections are high amplitude, high-frequency with continues and parallel geometries that are truncated by Jurassic sedimentary strata (Fig. 11b and c and ).\n\n\n7.3.2\nHyperbolic surface belonging to SF4\nPoor continuity, overprinting and braided internal geometries in seismic reflections of SF4 package make challenging to do a single structural map (Figs. 6\u20139 & 12, 14, 15). In addition, the 3D seismic reflection data do not cover the structure with deep enough. To solve this issue, we created different structural maps at the top of SF4 of the same reflection packages (Fig. 13a) and chose the most common geometry of these maps (Fig. 13b).\nA very strong, high amplitude tabular band with reflections of SF4 appears in cross-sections A to D between 4 and 8\u00a0s TWT (Figs. 6\u20139 & 12a) and in the time slices on the central structural salient (Fig. 12b). In section A-A\u2032, SF4 display two asymmetric tight anticlines structures separated by a major syncline structure. The axes of these anticlines coincide with the location of the westernmost part of the Froan Basin and the Klakk FC (Fig. 6a and c and ). The band of SF4 forms three similar structures in sections B-B\u2032, C-C\u2032 and D-D\u2019: an asymmetrical anticline towards the east, a flat to gently west-dipping area to the west, and west-dipping monocline below the Klakk FC (Figs. 7\u20139). In section B-B\u2032, the asymmetrical anticline is c. 19\u00a0km long, the gently west-dipping structure is c. 14.5\u00a0km long, and a small asymmetrical anticline below the ridge is c. 16\u00a0km long (Fig. 7). In section C-C\u2032, the asymmetric anticline has c. 40\u00a0km long, the flat zone of c. 9\u00a0km long, and the NW-dipping monocline is c. 8\u00a0km long below the Klakk FC strand (Fig. 8a and c and ). In section D-D\u2032, the anticline is c. 22.4\u00a0km long, the flat area is c. 10.5\u00a0km long and the monocline c. 10\u00a0km long. SF4 forms an NW-plunging tight anticline on the central structural salient (Figs. 5e and 12), and a west-plunging anticline on the central structural recess (Figs. 5e\u00a0and\u00a012a and ). Tabular bands with reflections of SF4 appears upwards until c. 3\u00a0s TWT (Figs. 6\u20139 & 12). Consequently, the Klakk FC shows a cross-cutting interaction (sensu Phillips et al., 2016) with SF4 until c. 6.5\u20137.2\u00a0s TWT, where it changes to a merging interaction (sensu Phillips et al., 2016) around the band of SF4 referenced (Figs. 5e, 6c and 8c, 9c). Locally, the Klakk FC exhibits a ramp-flat-ramp cross-sectional fault geometry (cf. Rotevatn and Jackson, 2014) where the fault overall cross-cuts the SF4 fabric, but locally merges with and follows the SF4 along the \u2018flat\u2019 (Fig. 12a).\nThe SF4 surface is best described as a west-dipping hyperbolic surface in three-dimensions which is composed by domes, antiforms and saddles that vary along and across strike (Fig. 13). These antiforms and saddles show two trends, parallel and perpendicular to the extension direction, and with an WNW trending through dividing the surface into two areas (Fig. 13b). The southern area shows an N-S elongate dome, which is c. 59.5\u00a0km long and c. 49\u00a0km wide at 6\u00a0s TWT. The geometry of this structure, however, changes at c. 6.4\u00a0s TWT depth, where it becomes a NW-plunging antiform towards the west. We name this antiformal structure as the \u201csouthern spur\u201d, which is c. 25\u00a0km long at 7.5\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 13b). The northern area displays two antiformal and one domal structures above 6.4\u00a0s TWT. At 6\u00a0s TWT, \u201cantiform 1\u201d strikes NNE-SSW and is\u00a0>\u00a026.6\u00a0km long, \u201cantiform 2\u201d strikes E-W to NE-SW and is\u00a0>\u00a039\u00a0km, and \u201cdome C\u2033 is c. 11\u00a0km \u201cAntiform 2\u2033 continues to the west forming the \u2018northern spur\u2019, which is c. 29\u00a0km long, c. 27.6\u00a0km wide at 7.4\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 13b). The interpretation of the structures, located to the north of the WNW depression, has significant uncertainty because of the poor continuity of the SF4 reflections (Fig. 13b).\nThe SF4 west-dipping hyperbolic surface geometry correlates well with the cloverleaf geometry observed in the gravity anomaly map (Fig. 13c) and the structural map at the top of the acoustic basement (Fig. 13d). Both the SF4 structure and gravity anomaly values dip toward the west, and the southern and northern spurs of SF4 overlap with the NW cloverleaf gravity anomaly (Fig. 13c). Moreover, we identify that the top of the eroded fault scarp of the Klakk FC coincides with the western flank of the gravity anomaly (Fig. 13c). Fig. 13d shows that the southern spur of SF4 matches with the central structural salient, while the northern spur of SF4 matches with the ridge located in the central structural recess. The Klakk FC is localised towards the western flank of both the gravity and SF4 structures (Fig. 13c and d and ). The segments of Klakk FC with displacement <3\u00a0km are localised in the eastern part of the central structural recess, which matches with the geometry of the SF4 spurs in this area. In addition, the basement map shows a series of west-trending canyons that coincide with the structural saddles located between the southern spur, north spur and northern structural salient (Fig. 13d).\n\n\n7.3.3\nDomal structure associated with SF3\nA concave-downward tabular band of SF3 reflections form an elongate domal intra-basement structure in the westernmost part of the central structural salient at 4\u20135.5\u00a0s TWT (Figs. 5e, 14 and 15). The structure exhibits a series of sub-domes within a tabular band of c. 1.5\u00a0s TWT (Figs. 5e, 14a and 15), which is manifested as a circular geometry of c. 5\u00a0km diameter in a time slice at 4.5\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 12b). The long axis of the dome structure is tilted to the SE in the dip direction, similar to the slope of the eroded fault scarp of the Klakk FC (Fig. 14a). The dome is located into the immediate footwall below the Klakk FC eroded fault scarp, and it interacts with the Klakk FC in an acute cross-cutting contact (Figs. 5e, 14a and 15).\nThe dome structure overprints the southern spur of SF4. The dome structure is located above a continuous tabular band of SF4 that dips towards the west in the dip direction (Fig. 14a), whereas at 5.5\u00a0s TWT (c. 10\u00a0km), this structure is separated by 5\u00a0km from the axis of the SF4 anticline in the strike direction (Figs. 5e\u00a0and\u00a015 and ). At 4.5\u00a0s TWT, the time slice shows two structures, a circular structure with SF3 at the NNW in the central structural salient and an NW-plunging anticline with SF4 in the SW part of the central structural salient (Fig. 14b). The absence of SF3 structures below 6.5\u00a0s TWT, the separation between the axes of SF3 dome and SF4 southern spur, and the presence of both structures at 4.5\u00a0s TWT suggest that SF3 dome overprinted the SF4 southern spur.\n\n\n\n\n8\nDiscussion\n\n8.1\nInterpretation of the intra-basement structures\nWe discuss the nature of the three intra-basement structures identified based on (i) the character of the intra-basement seismic facies, (ii) the location and geometry of the seismic facies, (iii) the geometries of the structures identified and (iv) the correlation with nearby intra-basement structures that are described in the literature (e.g. Osmundsen et al., 2002; Phillips et al., 2016; Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019).\n\n8.1.1\nDevonian sedimentary basin\nA bowl-like geometry structure gathers the SF1 facies, which we interpret as a Palaeozoic, likely Devonian (?), sedimentary basin (Fig. 11a); the basis for this interpretation is laid out below. The basin is located immediately below the top of the acoustic basement and above the ramp-flat-ramp geometry of SF4 band at c. 6.5\u00a0s TWT (Figs. 9 and 11). In addition, we observe a depositional contact between the Devonian (?) sedimentary rocks and the underlying (likely) crystalline or metamorphic basement. Devonian sedimentary basins outcrops towards the west of the study area (\u2018Old Red Sandstones\u2019) (Braathen et al., 2000; Eide et al., 2005), and have been proposed in the offshore in the northern Viking graben (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019). In addition, the Devonian H\u00e5steinen basin in onshore Norway has been interpreted as a ramp-type basin, which is related to the ramp-flat-ramp geometry of the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment Zone (Vetti and Fossen, 2012). Supported by the regional prominence of Devonian sedimentary basins, our observations lead us to interpret this basin as a Devonian supra-detachment ramp-type basin (sensu Vetti and Fossen, 2012). Our interpretation aligns with the observations of Trice et al. (2019), who propose a Devonian or Carboniferous basin in the acoustic basement using broadband reprocessed seismic data in the same geographical area where we identify the SF1.\n\n\n8.1.2\nSF4 shear zone as an offshore extension of the Devonian H\u00f8ybakken Detachment\nThe SF4 shear zone identified in the southern Fr\u00f8ya High has the same hyperbolic geometry as other Devonian detachment geometries mapped onshore and offshore Norway. The SF4 shear zone shows a ramp-flat geometry in a dip-direction cross-section, which is similar to the one below the Vingleia Fault in cross-section (Figs. 6\u20139 & 12) (Osmundsen et al., 2002, 2016; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018). In three-dimensions, the SF4 shear zone shows a complex west-dipping hyperbolic structure (sensu Wiest et al., 2019) comprised of anticlines, domes and spurs similar to the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment Zone or the H\u00f8ybakken Detachment onshore Norway (Figs. 15, 16a and 16\nc) (Osmundsen et al., 1998, 2002, 2006; Braathen et al., 2000; Skilbrei et al., 2002; Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019). Using potential field data, Skilbrei et al. (2002) propose that the H\u00f8ybakken, Kollstraumen and Nesna detachments extend offshore with an NW to NNW-strike direction (Fig. 3). In addition, Osmundsen et al. (2002) interpret that the detachment zone underneath the Vingleia Fault Complex may correspond to the offshore extension of the H\u00f8ybakken detachment on the Fr\u00f8ya High. Mjelde et al. (2016) suggest that the JML is a detachment zone that joins the MTCF in the southern Fr\u00f8ya High. The SF4 shear zone mapped in this study coincides with the southernmost location of the detachment zone proposed by Mjelde et al. (2016). Instead of joining the JML, however, the shear zone mapped in this study has NNE-SSW strike direction at 6\u00a0s TWT. This pattern coincides with the location of the central structural salient and the ridge in the central structural recess. Also, the presence of a series of anticlines above 6\u00a0s TWT, where the east flank localises toward the Froan Basin, may suggest that SF4 shear zone is the westward continuation of the H\u00f8ybakken detachment.\n\nFig. 8 by Gernigon et al. (2020) shows high-velocity lower crustal bodies that coincide with the geometry of our SF4 shear zone in the north and northwest parts of the Fr\u00f8ya High. The \u2018high-velocity lower crust\u2019 (also termed \u2018lower crust body\u2019 in Gernigon et al., 2020) has been interpreted as, (i) gabbroid intrusions into the pre-existing continental crust during the continental breakup, or (ii) inherited eclogites bodies (Gernigon et al., 2003; Mjelde et al., 2005, 2013). These bodies show velocities of 7.3\u20137.6\u00a0km\/s, and they were identified initially in the distal and outer domains of rifted margins (Gernigon et al., 2003; Mjelde et al., 2005, 2009a, 2009b, 2013). The high-velocity lower crustal bodies tend to thin and occur at progressively deeper levels towards the proximal domain. The hyperbolic geometry of SF4, however, show a series of intra-basement antiformal structures towards the top of the crystalline basement. We, therefore, suggest that the intra-basement reflections interpreted in Fig. 8 by Gernigon et al. (2020) are part of the same inherited shear zone as that which we correlate to SF4.\n\n\n8.1.3\nA rift-related shear zone and continental margin core complex\nWe interpret the SF3 symmetrical anticline as a shear zone related to rifting. The high-displacement of the Klakk FC has been related to the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous rifting phases (thinning and hyperextension deformation phases) (Blystad et al., 1995; Dor\u00e9 et al., 1999; Faleide et al., 2010; P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2018). Peron-Pinvidic et al. (2013) describe that high-\u03b2 \u2032type 1\u2032 faults generated during the thinning deformation phase may create rift-related shear zones in the necking domain. Osmundsen et al. (2002) and Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018) show similar reflections to SF3 underneath the Gossa High, which is located c. 62\u00a0km towards the SSW of the central structural salient (Fig. 2). They propose that these reflections correspond to the Sl\u00f8rebotn detachment, generated because of the displacement of the outer fault of the M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Complex during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous rifting phases. We interpret that the dome structure of SF3 on the NW-most part of the central structural salient is a rift-related shear zone because of the displacement of the Klakk FC and footwall isostatic compensation. The SF3 shear zone overprinted reflections of SF4 and might have formed at the same time as the Sl\u00f8rebotn detachment.\n\n\n\n8.2\nRole of structural inheritance at low-angle, high-displacement faults during the thinning deformation phase\n\n8.2.1\nThe Klakk FC as a high-\u03b2 \u2018Type 1\u2019 fault at the western flank of the Fr\u00f8ya High\nThe Klakk FC has low-angle (c. 7\u00b0\u201323\u00b0), large-offset (c. 20\u201335\u00a0km) fault segments in our study area. This fault complex shows highly eroded footwalls, and the continental crust has a wedge shape in cross-section changing from c. 24\u00a0km to c. 11\u00a0km thick. Consequently, we confirm previous interpretations where the western Fr\u00f8ya High is the necking domain of the Norwegian Passive Margin (Faleide et al., 2008; Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Mjelde et al., 2016; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018). Following the Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018) classification, these faults are High-\u03b2 \u2032type-1'. We modified, however, the Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013 and Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018 models for Klakk FC at the west of the Fr\u00f8ya High, showing the presence of combine and separated areas of inner and outer necking breakaways. We observe a considerable fault geometry variability in cross-section along strike: (i) the segments of the Klakk FC shows an upper part with >40\u00b0 shallowing to c. 20\u00b0 with depth on the northern structural salient; (ii) a small ridge divides the central recess into inner and outer necking breakaway zones; (iii) a single planar fault with c. 10\u00b0 dips is located at the central structural salient; and (iv) segments of Klakk FC with an upper part\u00a0>\u00a040\u00b0 that shallows to\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0 in the southern structural recess. Our observations show that the Klakk FC has an inner- and outer-necking breakaway on the structural recesses, whereas the Klakk FC behaves as a combined inner and outer necking breakaway zone at the structural salients.\n\n\n8.2.2\nRole of the inheritance along the Klakk FC\nThe Fr\u00f8ya High is an offshore gneiss-core culmination, which is c. 120\u00a0km long with a general NNW-SSE strike. This High has been interpreted as a continental core complex and is the continuation of the CNBW (Skilbrei et al., 2002; Eide et al., 2005; Osmundsen et al., 2005; Maystrenko et al., 2018). Using the CNBW as an onshore analogue, we infer that the Fr\u00f8ya High must be composed by nappes, Devonian metamorphic core complexes and Devonian sedimentary basins. We interpret two continental core complexes to the west of the Fr\u00f8ya High, located within the northern and central structural salients respectively (Fig. 4). The locations of these core complexes coincide with the morphology of the hyperbolic geometry of SF4 at depth. This relationship leads us to postulate that the location and evolution of the continental core complexes controlled the geometry of the inherited shear zone, which subsequent controlled the location of the structural salients and recess during rifting. The geometry of the Devonian shear zones has been related to the exhumation and geometry of continental core complexes, as well as, with the geometry of the Devonian supradetachment basins onshore Norway (e.g. Figs. 2 and 3) (Osmundsen et al., 1998, 2006; Braathen et al., 2000; Vetti and Fossen, 2012; Wiest et al., 2019). Fig. 16c shows a likely geometry of the Fr\u00f8ya High area during late Devonian based on (i) the extrapolation of the SF4 shear zone geometry towards the top basement, (ii) the presence of granitic rock exhumed (376\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma) in the northern Fr\u00f8ya High (Eide et al., 2005), (iii) the continuation of the H\u00f8ybakken detachment on the Fr\u00f8ya High (Osmundsen et al., 2002), (iv) the presence of high-grade metamorphic rocks with high magnetic values (>1200\u00a0nT) on the northern structural salient (Fig. 3b) (Skilbrei et al., 2002; Maystrenko et al., 2018), and (v) the presence of a Devonian basin on the Fr\u00f8ya High (Trice et al., 2019). This configuration may represent the inherited structural template for subsequent rifting phases.\nRheological variability related to inherited structures or lithology are candidates for what controlled the location of half-grabens on and around the Fr\u00f8ya High. Fault segments with high-dip angle in the upper part of the Klakk FC and the presence of faults that strike NE-SW suggest that some fault segments started as high angle faults during the stretching deformation phase (Permian-Lower Triassic). Widespread deformation that creates half-grabens within a continental crust of more-than 30\u00a0km thickness characterises the stretching deformation phase (Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Naliboff et al., 2017). We, therefore, suggest that some faults with a NE-SW strike on the Klakk FC could have developed at the same time as the Mandel basin and some faults in the Froan Basin during the stretching deformation phase (Fig. 16d). This hypothesis cannot be reliably tested in the study area, however, because the footwall is highly eroded, the limits of resolution of seismic reflection data, and the lack of well data in the hanging wall.\nThe segments of the Klakk FC acquired its non-collinear structural configuration in map-view during the late Jurassic rifting phase (thinning deformation phase) (Fig. 16b and e). The thinning deformation phase is characterised by deformation migration and localisation, thinning of the middle-to-upper crust or lower crust-to-upper mantle, and generation of High-beta \u2018type 1\u2032 faults that cause coupled deformation and the continental crustal wedge geometry (Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Sutra et al., 2013; Manatschal et al., 2015; Naliboff et al., 2017). We observe these characteristics in the Klakk FC. In addition, this rift phase caused the denudation of the western part of the Fr\u00f8ya High, and generation of hyperextended half-grabens. The presence of a late Jurassic unconformity and a middle Cretaceous unconformity on the Fr\u00f8ya High (as identified in boreholes 6306\/6-1, 6306\/6-2) suggest that the faults reactivated during the early Cretaceous rifting phase (exhumation) (Figs. 4 and 16f). Continuation of footwall erosion and creation of west-directed canyons may have developed during this time.\nThe segments of the Klakk FC merged onto the SF4 shear zone when the Klakk FC became High-\u03b2 \u2018type-1\u2019 during the thinning deformation phase (Fig. 16e). We observe that the lower part of the Klakk FC segments have a low-dip angle (>20\u00b0), and they tend to exhibit merging interaction (sensu Phillips et al., 2016) with the SF4 shear zone in the structural salients (Figs. 6\u20139). This interaction may become cross-cutting as it approaches the coupling fault. The role of the structural inheritance from pre-existing shear zones has been discussed in numerous studies using outcrop observations, seismic data and modelling (Osmundsen et al., 2002; Morley et al., 2004; Manatschal et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2017; Osagiede et al., 2020). These studies show that inherited shear zones may (i) accommodate major strain during the beginning of the thinning phase, (ii) deflect the stress orientation and influence the nearby younger faults, (iii) reactivate and propagate upwards as brittle faults, (iv) change the style of rift faulting, and (v) influence the final architecture of the necking zone. Based on these studies, we propose that deformation was localised on the Klakk FC area during the late Jurassic rifting phase. It reactivated the SF4 shear zone and caused faults to propagate upwards as brittle faults. These faults reached the surface or linked with faults generated during the first rifting phase (Fig. 16b and e).\nRift-related shear zones may be related to continental margin core complexes in the necking domain. The high displacement of the combined necking breakaway complex causes tectonic denudation and isostatic compensation, leading to exhumation of the middle crust. Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018) interpret a continental margin core complex on the Gossa High based on the large-offset normal fault, the thinning of the continental crust, the geometry of the shear zone and the highly-rotated Upper Jurassic syn-rift deposits in the Sl\u00f8rebotn subbasin. A significant thickness of an inherited ductile shear zone or a hot type margin (sensu Clerc et al., 2018) is required to allow isostatic uplifting on the immediate footwall or crustal boudinage of the lower crust (Clerc et al., 2015, 2018; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018). Although we did not observe highly-rotated Upper Jurassic sedimentary strata around the central structural salient of the Fr\u00f8ya High, we identified the other characteristics described on the Gossa High. It may suggest that the northwestern part of the central structural salient is a continental margin core complex that locally overprinted part of the SF4 shear zone.\nAlthough the JML serves as a regionally important structural boundary between the V\u00f8ring and More margin segments (Blystad et al., 1995; Mjelde et al., 2016), and although the Klakk FC interacts interact to the south with the JML, we have found no evidence to suggest that the JML formed a key inheritance control on the structure and evolution of the Klakk FC proper (see e.g. Figs. 5e, 12b and 15 where the is no seismic evidence to suggest an underlying control of the JML). It cannot be ruled out, however, that the JML exercised some control on the fault control as it grew, partially affecting its southern termination; or a precursor structure of it, may have affected the evolution and geometry of the continental core complex at the time of its evolution, well before the Klakk FC develop.\n\n\n\n8.3\nIntra-basement shear zones in others high-displacement normal faults\nHigh-displacement faults in necking domains with a thick continental crust have been recognised in the Iberian, Angolan, Santos, Campos, Socotra, Gulf of Lion, Newfoundland-Galicia rifted margins and the Great South Basin of New Zealand (Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013; Sutra et al., 2013; Jolivet et al., 2010; Nonn et al., 2017; Phillips and McCaffrey, 2019). However, only Phillips and McCaffrey (2019) in the Great South Basin of New Zealand evaluate the role of inherited structures in the development of a high-displacement normal fault using two cross-sections. The geometries of the intra-basement reflections described in Phillips and McCaffrey (2019) are similar to the ones below the Klakk FC (this work), as well as, the ones interpreted by Koehl et al. (2018) at the Barents Sea, though these are related to low-\u03b2 faults.\n\nPhillips and McCaffrey (2019) show that the High-\u03b2 \u2018Terrane boundary fault\u2019 separates the Median Batholith (in its footwall) from the \u2018Western Province Terranes' (in its hanging wall). These authors associate the antiformal intra-basement reflections in the immediate fault's footwall with two structures. (i) a crustal shear zone with sub-parallel, dipping intra-basement reflections that are merging and thinning downwards along the \u2018Terrane boundary fault\u2019 in cross-section; (ii) a granitic laccolith with cross-cutting intra-basement reflections that form an antiform (See their Figs. 4 and 5). They interpret that the \u2018Terrane boundary\u2019 is an inherited shear zone or fault with two subsequent processes, an intrusion of a felsic body and fault reactivation because of change in the extension direction. Koehl et al. (2018) described the geometry of the S\u00f8r\u00f8y\u2013Ing\u00f8ya shear zone, which has similar antiformal intra-basement geometries in the immediate footwall of the M\u00e5s\u00f8y Fault Complex and Troms\u2013 Finnmark Fault Complex (see their Figs. 5 and 6). They interpret the high-amplitude intra-basement reflections packages as part of the Devonian S\u00f8r\u00f8y\u2013Ing\u00f8ya shear zone, which owe their geometry to the excision and incision process during the evolution of the Devonian shear zone. They also postulate that geometry of the S\u00f8r\u00f8y\u2013Ing\u00f8ya shear zone controlled the location and geometries of later rift-related structures. Our model presents another alternative for the interpretation of antiformal intra-basement reflections in the immediate footwall of high-\u03b2 normal faults. As described early, we interpret that intra-basement reflections represent (i) an inherited Devonian (?) shear zone (SF4) and (ii) an Upper Jurassic (?) rift-related shear zone (SF3). Although we cannot discard intrusions completely, the seismic evidence suggests otherwise, and we favour Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic (2018) interpretation for the creation of Gossa High continental margin core complex. We suggest that the findings of findings of Phillips and McCaffrey (2019) support the ideas proposed herein, in indicating that inherited shear zones may control the final geometry of high-displacement (their Fig. 4), low-angle normal faults and, consequently, the geometry of the necking domains. This therefore validates the regional observations by Manatschal et al. (2015) for the architecture of necking domains in magma-poor rifted margins.\n\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nWe have integrated potential field, well data, 2D and 3D seismic reflection data to address the role of structural inheritance during the development of high-displacement (>10\u00a0km), low-angle (>30\u00b0) normal faults in the necking domains of rifted margins with a thick continental crust (>25\u00a0km). We conclude that:\n\n\u2022\nThe Klakk Fault Complex (Klakk FC) exhibits an overall N-S non-collinear pattern, which includes fault segments that locally strike NNW-SSE, NE-SW and N-S. These fault trends are strongly controlled by the location of two structural salients at the Fr\u00f8ya High.\n\n\n\u2022\nKlakk FC segments are generally high-\u03b2 \u2018type 1\u2019 faults with listric or planar cross-sectional geometries. The Klakk FC has inner- and outer necking breakaway zones on the structural recesses, while it has combined inner and outer necking breakaway zones towards the west of the structural salients.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe 3D structural mapping of intra-basement seismic facies allows us to recognise three structures, which are interpreted as a Devonian shear zone, a Devonian supradetachment basin, and a continental margin core complex (CMCC). We interpret the Devonian structures to be related to the orogenic collapse, while the CMCC to be a late Jurassic \u2013early Cretaceous rift-related structure.\n\n\n\u2022\nSF4 shear zone may be a continuation to the west of the Devonian H\u00f8ybakken Detachment. This shear zone has a hyperbolic geometry in three-dimension and their geometry has been locally modified by continental margin core complexes.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe geometry of the continental core complex and inherited shear zone control the location of normal faults during the stretching deformation phase. Therefore, they generate the initial constraints in the development of structural salients and recesses.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe mapped pre-existing shear zones place constraints on the final geometries of the high-\u03b2 \u2018type 1\u2019 faults during the thinning deformation phase. Consequently, pre-existing intra-basement shear zones placed a large control on the geometry and evolution of the necking domain developed in a thick continental crust (>25\u00a0km).\n\n\n\u2022\nThe interpreted structures and their control on the development of necking domains might be analogous to another areas with High-\u03b2 \u2018type-1\u2019 faults in a thick continental crust (>25\u00a0km), such as the Iberian, Angolan, Santos, and Campos margins (Peron-Pinvidic et al., 2013), the Socotra margin (Noon et al., 2017), the Gulf of Lion (Jolivet et al., 2015) and the Newfoundland-Galicia margin (Sutra et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJhon M.

This early post-rift subsidence affected the distal deep basins, the continental shelf and the proximal coastal basins of the Atlantic margin, and was coeval with km-scale erosional exhumation of large continental domains to the east (Ghorbal et al., 2008; Ghorbal, 2009; Saddiqi et al., 2009; Oukassou et al., 2013; Lepr\u00eatre et al., 2015a; Gouiza et al., 2017). The underlying process behind this exhumation is still unclear, for it took place \u223c30\u2013\u223c50 My after lithospheric breakup between Morocco and Nova Scotia (Klitgord and Schouten, 1986; Sahabi et al., 2004) but prior to the Atlas\/Alpine shortening that raised the Atlas and the Rif mountain belts (Frizon de Lamotte et al., 1991, 2008; Laville and Piqu\u00e9, 1992).\nSimilarly to other passive continental margins with comparable movements of their hinterlands (Japsen and Chalmers, 2000; Japsen et al., 2006, 2009; Peulvast et al., 2008; Bonow et al., 2009), the anomalous vertical movements in Morocco are likely to be driven by tectonic processes. Mechanisms proposed for the Central Atlantic include long wavelength mantle processes (e.g., dynamic topography; e.g., Hoggard et al., 2016; M\u00fcller et al., 2018), surface processes (e.g., climate driven enhanced erosion; e.g., Westaway et al., 2009), regional tectonics (e.g., rift uplifted shoulder; e.g., Ruiz et al., 2011) and horizontal far-field stresses linked to rifting onset or mid-oceanic ridge spreading (e.g., Bertotti and Gouiza, 2012; Japsen et al., 2012; Green et al., 2018). Mantle processes alone, such as small-scale convection cells at the base of the mantle lithosphere may not be able to explain the crustal km-scale exhumation during the early post-rift (Gouiza, 2011). In this frame, attempts to link the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous exhumation in the east to the coeval subsidence in the west have overlooked the existence of contemporaneous NE-SW to NNE-SSW crustal shortening that might have driven both upward and downward vertical movements along the margin (Gouiza, 2011; Bertotti and Gouiza, 2012).\nThe Essaouira-Agadir Basin is located on the coastal plain of the Atlantic rifted margin in Morocco, bounded to the E and NE by the Palaeozoic basement highs of the Massif Ancien of Marrakech and the Jebilets, respectively (Fig. 1). These massifs have experienced substantial exhumation in the early post-rift history (Middle-Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous; e.g., Ghorbal et al., 2008; Ghorbal, 2009), while the Essaouira-Agadir Basin records clastic input in the Middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (Duval-Arnould, 2019; Luber et al., 2019). The Essaouira-Agadir Basin is thus an ideal location to investigate the tectonic processes responsible for the km-scale vertical movements (Fig. 1B). Most of the compressional structures observed in the Essaouira-Agadir Basin are attributed to Alpine shortening events leading to the uplift of the Atlas Belt (Hafid et al., 2006; Hafid, 2000; Ellouz et al., 2003). Thickness changes observed in Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous rocks are interpreted as resulting from synsedimentary halokinesis (Hafid et al., 2006; Hafid, 2000). However, other studies show that numerous contractional structures developed during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous in the western High Atlas and surroundings (Gouiza, 2011; Bertotti and Gouiza, 2012; Benvenuti et al., 2017).\nThe Jbel Amsittene Anticline is located in the central western part of the Essaouira-Agadir Basin and is one of several comparable structures, within the western High Atlas basins, thought to be formed by salt diapirism from the Late Cretaceous onwards (Piqu\u00e9 et al., 1998; Hafid, 2000; Le Roy and Piqu\u00e9, 2001). In this work, we carry out a structural analysis of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline (Figs. 1B & 2\n), based on field observations in the Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks, and structural modeling. We present new evidence to discuss the tectonics of the formation of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline and its relationship with the growth of other structures in the context of regional vertical movements in the Moroccan rifted margin of the Central Atlantic.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nThe Essaouira-Agadir Basin forms the western termination of the Moroccan High Atlas (Fig. 1). The basin evolved as part of the Atlantic rift during Triassic to Early Jurassic times and as a proximal shallow-water platform of the rifted margin since the Middle Jurassic (e.g., Hafid, 2000). Later convergence between Africa and Iberia\/Europe since Late Cretaceous caused N\u2013S to NNW-SSE regional shortening that inverted the Atlas rift, including the Essaouira-Agadir Basin, and built-up the Atlas Mountains (e.g., Hafid et al., 2006; Hafid, 2000; Piqu\u00e9 et al., 2002; Lanari et al., 2020a, 2020b). The basin is bounded to the south by lithospheric-scale faults that continue along-strike of the High Atlas belt, and is marked with transpressional and transtensional reactivations since the continental break-up (Ellero et al., 2020).\nThe Essaouira-Agadir Basin is composed of grabens and half-grabens bounded by N\u2013S to NNE-SSW normal faults and E-W transform faults (Hafid et al., 2006; Hafid, 2000). These extensional rift structures are filled by terrigenous red beds of Triassic age with widespread intercalations of basalt flows, unconformably overlain by an early Lower Jurassic evaporitic sag basin (Hafid et al., 2006). An early Pliensbachian unconformity is commonly considered to be the breakup unconformity, and seals syn-rift sequences and structures (Medina, 1995). Following continental breakup in the Central Atlantic, sedimentation became mostly marine in the Essaouira-Agadir Basin, leading to accumulation of a thick carbonate platform in the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous (increasing westwards from 0.5\u202fkm to 2\u202fkm; e.g., Z\u00fchlke et al., 2004), with sandstone and shale interbeds. Deposition of Upper Cretaceous to Neogene shale-dominated series followed, with intercalations of limestone beds (Hafid, 2000). Shortening in the Atlas domain initiated in the Late Cretaceous, leading to the formation of the Atlas fold-and-thrust belt (Frizon de Lamotte et al., 2000; Piqu\u00e9 et al., 2002; Teixell et al., 2003), and is believed to have triggered the formation of salt-cored anticlines in the Essaouira-Agadir Basin, with minor inversion of Triassic normal faults (Hafid et al., 2006).\nOther major tectonic events affected the Moroccan margin after the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean in addition to the inversion and uplift of the Atlas belt (e.g. Teixell et al., 2003). Low-temperature thermochronology documents km-scale exhumation that affected most of the Precambrian-Palaeozoic domains exposed to the east of the Atlantic margin (i.e. Meseta plateau, Jebilet, Massif Ancien of Marrakech, Anti-Atlas belt) during Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous times (Ghorbal et al., 2008; Ghorbal, 2009; Saddiqi et al., 2009; Ruiz et al., 2011; Oukassou et al., 2013; Sehrt, 2014). The Palaeozoic basement highs bounding the Essaouira-Agadir Basin, the Massif Ancien of Marrakech to the east, and the Jebilet to the northeast, experienced km-scale exhumation during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (Ghorbal, 2009; Saddiqi et al., 2009). Coeval exhumation events are also documented along the margin in the Meseta plateau to the north (Ghorbal, 2009; Saddiqi et al., 2009) and in the Anti-Atlas to the south (Malus\u00e0 et al., 2007; Ruiz et al., 2011; Oukassou et al., 2013; Sehrt, 2014; Gouiza et al., 2017; Charton et al., 2018). This regional exhumation seems to have occurred during the post-rift stage of the Central Atlantic Ocean, i.e. \u223c30\u2013\u223c50 Myr after lithospheric breakup between Morocco and Nova Scotia (Klitgord and Schouten, 1986; Sahabi et al., 2004), and thus, before the Atlas\/Alpine contraction that gave rise to the Atlas and the Rif mountain belts (Frizon de Lamotte et al., 1991, 2008; Laville and Piqu\u00e9, 1992) and related km-scale exhumation (Lanari et al., 2020b).\nJbel Amsittene is a well-exposed salt-cored anticline that strikes ENE-WSW (Fig. 2A). It is located on the coastal plain of the W Moroccan Atlantic margin, in the northwest of the Essaouira-Agadir Basin between the cities of Essaouira to the north and Agadir to the south (Fig. 1). The Jbel Amsittene Anticline has a limited extent to the west where offshore seismic data shows no folding \u223c10\u202fkm off the present coastline (Hafid et al., 2006).\nThe stratigraphy of Jbel Amssittene used in this study is based on Duffaud et al. (1966), Ja\u00efdi et al. (1970) and Z\u00fchlke et al. (2004). The stratigraphic column shown in Fig. 2B is taken from the 1:100000 geologic map of the study area (Ja\u00efdi et al., 1970), and shows an almost-continuous series of Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous rocks unconformably covered, near the coast, by Quaternary sediments. The oldest formation, exposed in the core of the anticline, comprises Upper Triassic (T) terrigenous sandstones and evaporites. An erosional event, marked by a stratigraphic gap, occurred before Early Jurassic (J0-J1) open-marine deposition. A gradual transition from floodplain to inner shelf environment during the Middle Jurassic (J2-J3; e.g., Duval-Arnould, 2019), resulted in a sedimentary change from predominantly siliciclastic sand-dominated units to shallow marine carbonates. The Upper Jurassic (J4-J5) sediments are mainly shallow marine carbonates of inner shelf to lagoonal environment, although there are some sandstones and clastic interbeds (Ouajhain et al., 2011). An environmental change from inner (J\/C\u2013C1\u2013C2) to outer shelf occurred by the end of the Early Cretaceous (C3). Quaternary terrestrial colluviums and coastal deposits overlie the Mesozoic rocks (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3\nJbel Amsittene Anticline geological cross-sections and field observations\nWe performed detailed structural fieldwork to understand the tectonic history of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline. Whenever possible, we differentiated between two deformational events; (i) deformation related to Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous structures involving soft sediment deposition, as a means to assess the stress field during the early post-rift of the Central Atlantic, and (ii) deformation related to (presumably-Cenozoic) Alpine events. We show relevant and representative outcrops (Fig. 2A) that summarize the main structural observations along three cross-sections. We provide uninterpreted pictures of these outcrops and complementary pictures in the Supplementary Material.\nThe studied geological cross sections are roughly 4\u202fkm apart transecting the anticline across its axis, NNW-SSE, and were constrained by bed measurements and field observations. Cross-section A (Fig. 3\n) is parallel to a road-cut for most of its length, which results in the best rock exposures in the area. Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks outcrop in the south and central parts of the section and are covered by Quaternary deposits in the northern region. Cross-section B (Fig. 4\n) is located \u223c4\u202fkm east of cross-section A and parallel to it. Cross-section B has sectors with poor accessibility or covered by vegetation and a small number of well-preserved outcrops. Cross-section C (Fig. 5\n) is \u223c4\u202fkm east of cross-section B, and parallel to the previous sections. We further detail two additional cross-sections and an outcrop farther east. Finally, we describe and recapitulate information relevant for the discussion in the form of along-strike and across-strike lateral variations, syn-sedimentary deformation, and a 3D thickness model.\n\n3.1\nWestern section: Cross-section A\nThe lower Lower Cretaceous (C1) to lower Middle Jurassic (J2) limestone, marl, and sandstone layers dip south in most of the southern flank and change from horizontal to steeply north-dipping where the topography is the highest. North of the topographic high, layers dip south again and finally outcrop as overturned, prior to being covered by Quaternary deposits in the northernmost area of the section. Quaternary rocks prevent an unambiguous thickness comparison between the older units on both sides of the anticline. Those that could be compared showed no changes in thicknesses. The transition from horizontal to overturned layers is observed in the oldest Jurassic limestones and shales exposed in this section (lowermost Jurassic, J1). The dip of the stratigraphic layers indicates a northward verging anticline with a t\u00eate-plongeante (plunging head) shape (sensu Seguret, 1972) in its central-northern sectors.\nLower Cretaceous marls and carbonates dip gently to the south (10\u00b0-20\u00b0) in the southernmost part of the southern flank (\u201ca\u201d in Fig. 3A), and become steeper towards the north, reaching dips of \u223c80\u00b0 at the highest point of the topography. Changes in dip are not constant and north dipping layers outcrop in the central sector of the southern flank (Fig. 3A), within the middle and lower Upper Jurassic shales, marls and limestones (J4). Moving northwards, the dip of the layers locally changes in relation to secondary N-verging folds tens of meters in size. Three conjugate fault sets outcrop in a local topographic flat (Fig. 3A), in the uppermost Upper Jurassic-lowermost Lower Cretaceous (J-C) limestones. We identify conjugate sets as faults with the same kinematics, coherent dip and dip angle (between \u223c45 and 60\u00b0), and independently-measured striae on both fault planes located at \u223c90\u00b0 from the fault planes intersection, and derive the orientation of the stress ellipsoid from the striations of conjugate faults (Fig. 3B). We show one of them in Oc1 (Fig. 3B). The regional bedding dips gently to the SSE, and the three conjugate fault sets show clear striations of sub-horizontal to gently S directions (from 216\u00b0\/04\u00b0 to 171\u00b0\/20\u00b0). The fault planes and associated striations are indicative of N\u2013S to NNE-SSW maximum horizontal stresses, both for limestones rotated with respect to the regional bedding (post-tilted) and non rotated (pre-tilted). From this outcrop northwards, bed dips start to increase and reach values up to \u223c55\u00b0 toward the south (\u201cb\u201d; Fig. 3A). Less than 50\u202fm before the exposure of the lower Lower Cretaceous limestones and marls (C1), a N\u2013S-striking sub-vertical clastic dyke of marine clastics cuts S-dipping strata (Oc2; Fig. 3C). A few meters northwards, a syn-sedimentary N-verging ramp fold indicates soft sediment deformation (Oc3; Fig. 3D). Whereas the conjugate fault set in Oc.1 (Fig. 3B) suggests no deformation took place before deposition of uppermost Upper Jurassic \u2013 lowermost Lower Cretaceous unit (J-C), the latter two syn-sedimentary structures (Oc2; Oc3, Fig. 3C and D) indicate NNW-SSE shortening during its deposition.\nStructures north of these outcrops seem to be exclusively related with the Alpine deformation phase. Approximately 200\u202fm north of these outcrops, the Upper Jurassic shale and limestone layers (J5) dip north (\u201cc\u201d in Fig. 3A). Steep and sub-vertical N-dipping overturned layers alternate occasionally with S dipping beds (\u201cd\u201d) for \u223c400\u202fm in lower and middle Upper Jurassic rocks (J4). Bedding-parallel flexural slip associated with Alpine deformation is common and related striations show a N\u2013S slip direction. Northward, Middle Jurassic (J3-J2) limestones and fine clastics dip consistently south until the topographic profile reaches its highest elevations (\u201ce\u201d). North of the topographic high, the orientation of Lower Jurassic strata (J1) changes from subvertical (\u223c80\u00b0) to subhorizontal with a gentle S-dip within a distance of ca. 500 m (Fig. 3A). Between the sub-vertical and sub-horizontal Lower Jurassic (J1) layers, S and N dipping sub-vertical strata alternate. Within this sector (\u201cf\u201d in Fig. 3A), highly deformed structures appear, showing faulted and folded strata, m-folds, recumbent folds, fault-related-folds, and more complex features, with unclear or non-sequential vergence. More to the north, the Lower Jurassic dolomites show no consistent strike for \u223c300\u202fm, and layers are overturned (up to \u223c60\u00b0) or S-dipping. Around 300\u202fm east of the section, Upper Triassic evaporites (T) outcrop in a circular depression of approximately 1\u202fkm in diameter (Oc.4; Fig. 3E). An intrusive contact is seen between the evaporites and the lowermost Jurassic unit (J1). The Lower Jurassic bedding dips away from the outcropping evaporites, from sub-vertical nearby to 25\u00b0 in a few hundred meters farther away from them. The strike directions of these Jurassic rocks vary consistently around the salt, in an overall concentric configuration. The strike directions progressively change to the regional E\u2212W to SW\u2212NE trends 300\u2013400\u202fm away from the evaporites. Continuing north along cross-section A, overturned strata become subvertical (80\u00b0-85\u00b0) (\u201cg\u201d) and finally N-dipping, before reaching the sub-horizontal Quaternary (Q) rocks that unconformably cover most of the northern flank. In this area, a sequence of SSE-verging fault-propagation folds outcrops in the Lower Jurassic limestones (J1), with axial planes indicating a SSE-to-NNW shortening direction (Oc5; Fig. 3F).\n\n\n3.2\nCentral section: Cross-section B\nGently south dipping lower Middle Jurassic (J2) to lower Lower Cretaceous (C1) shales and limestones outcrop from the southern side of the anticline until significantly north of the topographic high (Fig. 4A). The oldest rocks seen in the section are Lower Jurassic (J1; shales) and outcrop \u223c1,5\u202fkm north of the topographic high, in the core of the anticline. North of the hinge of the anticline there are steep north dipping layers of lower Middle Jurassic (J2) to Lower Cretaceous (C1) age. Some of these steep layers are overturned and dip south (\u201ci\u201d in Fig. 4A). Further north, the Lower Cretaceous strata (C2\u2013C3) have gentle north dipping slopes. The uppermost Upper Jurassic to lower Lower Cretaceous (J-C to C1) rocks are significantly thinner in the northern (\u223c350\u202fm) than in the southern (>900\u202fm) flank along cross-section B (Fig. 4A).\nIn the southernmost of cross-section B, Quaternary (Q) deposits cover Lower Cretaceous rocks (C1\u2013C3) (\u201ca\u201d in Fig. 4A). Northwards, rocks of the uppermost Upper Jurassic to lower Lower Cretaceous (J-C to C1) outcrop with consistent dips of \u223c40\u00b0 to the south (\u201cb\u201d). Upper Jurassic (J4-J5) limestone layers have steeper dips that vary from \u223c40\u00b0 to \u223c65\u00b0 to the south (\u201cc\u201d). Further north, the Middle Jurassic (J2-J3) layers gradually decrease in steepness from \u223c45\u00b0 to \u223c35\u00b0 to the south (\u201cd\u201d) and become roughly parallel to the topography (\u201ce\u201d, dips of 10\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 to the south) as they reach the topographic high.\nStarting 300\u202fm northwards of the topographic high, \u223c20\u00b0\u201340\u00b0 south dipping layers alternate with \u223c40\u00b0 north dipping layers. This trend continues for \u223c400\u202fm, and is seen also for parts of the Lower Jurassic (J1) rocks (\u201cf\u201d). Layers are folded asymmetrically in this area until the northward dips become dominant (Oc.6; Fig. 4B). Advancing farther north, these Lower Jurassic (J1) shale-limestone layers overturn and dip south again, for a distance of more than 900\u202fm. Dip angles of overturned Lower Middle Jurassic (J2) layers are here less verticalized than along the rest of this section (175\u00b0\/73\u00b0) (\u201cg\u201d). The Jurassic rocks are locally underthrusted in a fault-bend fold structure that indicates top to the south motion (Oc.7; Fig. 4C). The layers remain sub-vertical for around 1100\u202fm, and gradually decrease in steepness, from \u223c85\u00b0 to \u223c50\u00b0 to the north, in the lowermost Cretaceous (J-C) unit (\u201ch\u201d). Toward the north, layers of the lowest Lower Cretaceous (C1) are sub-vertical again, while the middle Lower Cretaceous (C2) strata have shallower dips (40\u00b0 N) (\u201ci\u201d) that decrease gradually to 20\u00b0 N when reaching the upper Lower Cretaceous (C3) shales. Observations show no evidence of synsedimentary deformation in the limestones and marls of uppermost Upper Jurassic to lower Lower Cretaceous (J-C to C1) age along the cross-section B, but these units show a decrease of >500\u202fm in thickness across the anticline strike (Fig. 4A).\n\n\n3.3\nEastern section: Cross-section C\nCross-section C portrays a north vergent anticline with two hinges, showing a northern steeply dipping flank and a southern gently dipping flank (Fig. 5A). The rocks exposed along this easternmost section are early Middle Jurassic (J2) to late Early Cretaceous (C3) in age. The thickness of the lowermost Cretaceous (J-C) formation varies from approximately 550\u202fm on the southern flank to 400\u202fm on the northern flank of the anticline, whereas the thicknesses of the Jurassic formations J2 to J5 are constant along the section.\nIn cross-section C, the southern flank of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline is characterized by south dipping sedimentary limestones, marls and shales (\u201ca\u201d in Fig. 5A), with subhorizontal Cretaceous rocks in its southernmost sector. Towards the north, older south-dipping carbonates crop out. Within the lowermost Lower Cretaceous \u2013 uppermost Lower Jurassic formation (J-C), layer inclinations vary between approximately 30\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 to the south (\u201cb\u201d). Here, the layers are locally offset by cm to dm-scale reverse faults, which indicate N\u2013S to NNE-SSW shortening coveal with sedimentation. Outcrop 8 (Fig. 5B) shows an example of these reverse faults in limestones. SSW dipping faults in this outcrop have up to \u223c20\u202fcm offset and terminate in the slumped overlying sediments that show soft deformation, indicating a possible phase of syn-sedimentary deformation during the early post-rift of the Central Atlantic.\nOutcrops farther north evidence deformation due to Alpine shortening. Towards the topographic high, the dip of the bedding gradually decreases from \u223c40\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 to the south, and upper Middle to middle Upper Jurassic (J3 \u2013 J4) rocks are exposed (\u201cc\u201d). Calcite-filled tension gashes are observed in several outcrops in and around the topographic high (Oc. 9; Fig. 5C). The veins are spaced by a few cm, and show both top-to-the-north and top-to-the-south shear kinematics. The former occurs mostly to the south of the topographic high, and the latter is observed mainly to the north of the topographic high. Northwards, along a \u223c500\u202fm sector, the beds are subhorizontal gently dipping to the north (\u201cd\u201d). Approximately 1\u202fkm farther north, beds dip to the south for \u223c100\u202fm before dipping north again (\u201ce\u201d) and lower Middle Jurassic (J2) carbonates and sandstones are exposed. In the second topographic high, where the second hinge plane of the anticline intersects the topography, the orientation of the bedding is 65\u00b0 to the north (\u201cf\u201d). Between the second topographic high and the valley north of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline, successive upper Middle Jurassic (J3) to lower Lower Cretaceous (C1) strata are exposed steeply dipping north (60\u201380\u00b0) (\u201cg\u201d). North of the valley, Lower Cretaceous (C1 to C3) limestone and marl strata are exposed dipping \u223c10\u201320\u00b0 northwards (\u201ch\u201d).\n\n\n3.4\nEastern sectors of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline\nOther relevant structural observations were found eastwards of the above-described sections. The most relevant structure for the scope of this study outcrops \u223c5\u202fkm to the east of cross-section C, in the lowermost Cretaceous (J-C) limestones (Oc. 10; Fig. 6\n). This outcrop depicts a series of high angle reverse faults dipping SSW that transect limestones below a \u223c30\u202fm long sedimentary wedge that pinches out towards the S. The top-to-the-north faults show reverse offsets of few to tens of centimeters and slickenlines indicating SSW-NNE shortening direction. The upper terminations of the faults are within the overlying lowermost Cretaceous syn-tectonic strata, and indicate active deformation during this period.\n\n\n3.5\nStructure and lateral variations in the Jbel Amsittene Anticline\nWe produced a structural map of the Jbel Amsittene (Fig. 7\nA). The map uses data collected from Section A to the coast, as in Brautigam et al. (2009), and two sections we reconstructed further east, where the anticline is more open (shown in Fig. 7B). These sections are similar in overall structure and geometry and change relevantly, albeit continuously, along the strike of the anticline (Fig. 7). The eastern sections (bottom of Fig. 7B) depict an open and asymmetrical anticline with a gentle north vergence. In the eastern sections (i) the southern limb dips gently and persistently south, (ii) salt deformation is not noticeable, neither in the hinge nor elsewhere, and (iii) the northern limb shows north dips with no overturned strata. The anticline shows a well-confined hinge and its flanks dip more gently than their western continuations. Small-scale structures are rare and more open. The layers along the limbs have an alternation of sectors with constant dip and sectors where dips vary progressively. By contrast, the western sections (top of Fig. 7B) present a tight structure and a clear north vergence. In the western sections, (i) the southern limb of the anticline dips south, from gently to steep, with local dips to the north, (ii) distortion by diapirism is limited to the vicinity of the hinge where the salt is outcropping, and (iii) the northern limb is frequently overturned and partly covered by Quaternary deposits. The western sections show a topographic crest characterized by a north t\u00eate-plongeante geometry. Strain markers are numerous and strata often show relevant changes in dip direction over short horizontal distances.\n\n\n3.6\nThickness changes along the Jbel Amsittene\nTo obtain thickness variations in the Jurassic formation, we put forward a 3D thickness model integrating remote sensing (horizon mapping) and structural data (dip data and geological cross sections; Fig. 8\n). We used a \u201c3 point-solver\u201d plug-in for Google EarthTM to derive bed attitude from the contact between beds and topography at three or more points (Bennison and Moseley, 2003). With these means, we collect dip data of bed contacts tens of meters in scale, at various locations around the anticline. We mapped horizons on DEM-coupled satellite images (Google Earth Pro\u2122) to obtain spatial coordinates of well-exposed geological contacts, identified by the georeferenced geological map of Choubert (1965) and color changes in the imagery. We used the mapped horizons and the large-scale (tens of meters) dip data in geological cross-sections to derive a 3D model of continuous stratigraphic surfaces using StructuralLab tool of Gocad. We then used the kine3d-1 tool and Matlab to obtain true thickness maps from the mapped horizons. Model resolution suggests a precision of \u223c20\u202fm\u202fat the surface, and hence lies below the thinnest stratigraphic units within the study area.\nThickness maps reveal an along-strike change in the thickness of Jurassic rocks (Fig. 8). Thickness variations comprise the Lower Jurassic (J0, J1), Middle Jurassic (J2, J3), and Upper Jurassic (J4, J5) along a clockwise profile from the northwestern to the southwestern fold flanks. We find maximum unit thicknesses in the overturned northern flank and a decrease in thicknesses eastwards. Such thickness decrease is substantial at the point where the fold limbs change into NNW dipping beds. All formations follow this trend, that becomes less significant towards the Upper Jurassic (J4, J5). It is worth noticing, however, that modeling is less precise in overturned layers. In the southern limbs, towards the west, thicknesses in all formations increase progressively, albeit remaining below thicknesses of the northern limb (Fig. 8). Generally, thicknesses are never constant along the anticline strike for >5\u202fkm. Thickness at the eastern side are around 40\u201350\u202fm in J3 and 140\u202fm and 80\u202fm in J4, respectively. Sediments increase in thickness towards the southern limbs, with 140\u202fm\u2013200\u202fm for J3. This corresponds to a thickness increase of \u223c70\u201375%. The J4a (Oxfordian) strongly increases from around 140\u202fm to more than 300\u202fm.\nWe also derive thicknesses for the upper Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous units (J-C, C1, and C2) using bed attitudes along unit contacts. We use this input to infer the planes of contact between the sedimentary units and calculate true thicknesses by measuring the distance between contacts orthogonally. Although this approach is less accurate and lacks the along-strike coverage of the aforementioned thickness model, it provides a valid first-order estimate on the variation of sedimentary thickness across strike. The upper Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous units (J-C, C1, and C2) decrease in thickness northwards across the strike of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline (Table 1\n). As seen in cross-sections A and B (Figs. 4 and 5), formations J-C and C1 are up to \u223c350\u202fm thinner in the northern flank with respect to the southern flank of the anticline (Table 1). These values represent a minimum estimate, given that the upper boundary of C1 is in places outside the limits of our study area. Our observations suggest that sedimentary thickness changes affect C2 as well, and that no thickness changes affect the Lower Cretaceous C3 formation. These thickness variations are less obvious in the east of the study area (Fig. 7).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nKey characteristics of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline\nThe Jbel Amsittene Anticline has a limited lateral extent and shows geometry changes along strike (Fig. 7). In the west, the anticline manifests as a box anticline with a gentle north vergence within a broader area of deformation. The anticline continues westwards for less than \u223c10\u202fkm off the coastline (Hafid, 2006). The tight t\u00eate-plongeante that the anticline has in the west smoothens and widens eastward into an open fold (up to \u223c20\u202fkm in wavelength) and eventually wanes. The eastward plunge of the fold axis and the southward dip of its axial plane (Fig. 7) results in the exposure of the oldest rocks at the core of the anticline in the west and their location to the north of the topographic high.\nThickness variations have different trends in Jurassic and Early Cretaceous units. Jurassic units show a signal of eastward decreasing thicknesses along strike, with maxima in the anticline center (Fig. 8). The cumulative thickness for the Jurassic units has sharp variations of up to 900\u202fm between the northern flank and the eastern termination of the anticline, while between the latter and the southern flank, thickness variations are of \u223c600\u202fm. A second-order signal across the anticline strike portrays a decrease in thickness towards the southern flank (Fig. 8). The combined thickness of units J-C and C1 decreases by up to 500\u202fm northwardsacross the axis of the anticline, and by up to 250\u202fm eastwards over a short distance (Table 1). Whereas thickness changes in Jurassic units seem unrelated to a tectonic event, the latter units may relate to changes in shortening rates, as shown below.\nDifferential strain distribution along the anticline strike can be inferred for modern and antecedent forms of the anticline. We derive along-strike changes in amount of shortening from variations in line-length approximations along the present anticline strike, and from the number and size of outcrop-scale syn-sedimentary structures in the Upper Jurassic \u2013 lower Lower Cretaceous (J-C) formation (Table 2\n). The western section presents line-length shortening values of \u223c1,6\u202fkm over a measured length of \u223c7,6\u202fkm, i.e., \u223c21% shortening. This shortening value remains almost constant in the central section (\u223c20%), and decreases in the eastern section (14,5%). Farther east, in the easternmost section, we measured 0,2\u202fkm of shortening over a length of \u223c4,3\u202fkm, i.e. \u223c4,5% shortening (Table 2). Thus, line-length shortening decays along the Jbel Amsittene Anticline strike from its center to the east. Although most deformation and probably the observed eastward decay in shortening along the anticline strike relates to structure tightening during Alpine times, we infer a similar trend for the syn-depositional structures in the Upper Jurassic \u2013 lower Lower Cretaceous (J-C) formation. Most of such syn-depositional structures appear in the west of the anticline and are absent in coveal rocks in the east and in rocks of upper Lower Cretaceous (C3) age exposed in the northern part of the study area. This suggests that the eastwards decrease in shortening resulted in a westward-opening conical anticline by the end of the Lower Cretaceous (C3).\nSyn-sedimentary deformation is common in outcrops of the uppermost Upper Jurassic-lowermost Cretaceous limestones (J-C), and is expressed as clastic dykes, fault-related folds and reverse faults affecting soft sediment (Figs. 3\u20135, 7). Overall top-to-the-north steep reverse faults with tips that offset soft sediments by few to tens of centimeters (Figs. 5 and 6) suggest N\u2013S to NNE-SSW shortening. This observation can be coupled with striae in nearby conjugate fault sets indicating NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW maximum horizontal stresses (Fig. 6). Other equivalent coeval reverse faults are also steep in their pre-rotated stages, and probably result from reactivation of Triassic\u2013Liassic normal faults. Similar evidence of syn-sedimentary shortening during deposition of the J-C unit can be found along the anticline strike. However, regional layer dips for this unit vary greatly (between approximately 30\u00b0 and 80\u00b0), and evidence in other outcrops, such as the t\u00eate-plongeante or the overturned strata, are clear indications of younger shortening. Taken together, the data suggest that shortening initiated anticline growth of the Jbel Amsittene during the early post-rift phase of the Central Atlantic, and that the anticline further developed and tightened during the Alpine orogeny (e.g., Saura et al., 2013 in the Central High Atlas; Pichel et al., 2019b in the offshore Essaouira-Agadir Basin; this study in the Jbel Amsittene).\n\n\n4.2\nModels for the evolution of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline\nWe put forward two potential models for the evolution of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline in Mesozoic times. We discuss, on the basis of the evidence presented in this contribution, our preferred model for an initial Mesozoic anticline development, which was enhanced and partly overprinted in the Cenozoic. Comparative, detailed structural studies inclusive of similar onshore anticlines in the area are required to confidently discriminate among these two potential evolutionary models proposed for the Jbel Amsittene Anticline, and elucidate the underlying growth mechanism for equivalent structures in the Moroccan margin. Discrimination among different the models would have implications on the geodynamic causes controlling the anomalous vertical motions during the early post-rift phase along the African margin.\nIn the first scenario, we assume the diapiric rise of the Triassic salt at the core of the present anticline is the driving force leading anticline growth already during the Early to Middle Jurassic. Halokinesis and salt tectonics are well expressed in the area (Hafid et al., 2006; Hafid, 2000) and proposed to happen during this period in the Central High-Atlas (Saura et al., 2013) and in the offshore Essaouira-Agadir Basin (Pichel et al., 2019a). Although extensive diapirism exists offshore Morocco, no clear interpretations of pre-Cretaceous timing and mechanism(s) of salt mobilisation are available, and it thus may occur in relation to different mechanisms than in the onshore (Neumaier et al., 2016). Moreover, salt mobilisation may potentially lead to syn-sedimentary deformation along the sides of the diapir and sedimentary dykes (Morley et al., 1998; Giles and Lawton, 2002 respectively; see examples in Poprawski et al., 2014). The Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous deformation features may therefore be gravity-driven sedimentation features of local origin that can form on any submarine slope of a few degrees.\nMany syn-sedimentary faults observed in the field are very steep. This might be the result of fault measurements concentrating on the steep, upper tips of the faults, for none of the faults has its root exposed. Moreover, the upper tips seem to show a sharp termination, potentially lithology-controlled. Is it thus possible that these faults are intraformational, and that they, and folded units, were generated by shear stresses of individual sedimentary packages sliding along bedding planes. This could be associated with slope gravity processes or a rising salt diapir, but this is unlikely given that some of these structures have vergence towards the diapir. Slope oversteepening can be purely sedimentary, and tectonic processes do not have to be involved to explain their formation. In this scenario, vertical movements (Stets, 1992; Bertotti and Gouiza, 2012; Gouiza et al., 2017) could be linked to anticline fold growth and salt tectonics, such that a gravitational load is applied by the uplift of the High Atlas and by the subsiding continental margin, creating a hydraulic head and leading to salt activation (Pichel et al., 2019a). The presence of salt in the anticline core and Jurassic thickness variations along the anticline that do not relate to the present structure are potential indicators for such salt-driven scenario, although further evidence from nearby anticlines need to be found.\nIn the second scenario, we assume that the Jbel Amsittene Anticline initially formed by horizontal shortening in the latest Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous. Horizontal shortening would mark an initial period of contraction and folding during the early post-rift phase, leading to the syn-tectonic growth of sedimentary wedges at anticline and outcrop scales (Figs. 4 and 5). Shortening would have started during latest Jurassic \u2013 earliest Cretaceous (J-C) and continued during the deposition of the Lower Cretaceous unit (C1), but ended before unit C3 deposition. During this time, the Jbel Amsittene developed as an open anticline that was probably asymmetrical along strike. The Triassic salt would function as a weak detachment facilitating accommodation of the horizontal stresses that lead to the reactivation of pre-existing structures (e.g., basement rift-related faults) and initial anticline growth before Cretaceous-Cenozoic tectonics (Hafid et al., 2006; Tari et al., 2003; Hafid, 2006). This shortening tectonics would be consistent with field observations of syn-sedimentary structures in the J-C unit and structures with clear vergence tens of meters away from the outcropping salt (Fig. 3). The lack of coherency in trend or scale of the salt with the overall anticline structure are also indicators of absence of halokinesis in the Jbel Amsittene during early post-rift of the Central Atlantic. These observations imply that Triassic salts were mobilised during compression led by horizontal tectonic forces, and that the growth of associated structures occurred in relation to a blind thrust rooted in the Triassic salt. The t\u00eate-plongeante structure towards the west and overturned layers at some sites indicate further shortening and anticline tightening during Alpine times. These structures and their consistent change along strike (Fig. 7) argue for vertical anticline growth during two overprinting phases of shortening, both acting roughly in the N\u2013S direction. We thus consider that the evidence reported here favors the second scenario by which the latest Jurassic \u2013 earliest Cretaceous growth of the Jbel Amsittene occurred by tectonic shortening.\nThe Jbel Amsittene Anticline ENE-WSW strike is parallel to the strike of the major structures bounding the High Atlas belt (Fig. 1B). These structures activated under a transtensional regime during the Triassic-Early Jurassic rifting of the Central Atlantic, and defined several pull-apart basins where grabens and half-grabens, bounded by N- to NE-trending normal faults, were filled by terrigenous and evaporitic deposits (Piqu\u00e9 et al., 2002; Laville et al., 2004; Frizon de Lamotte, 2005). In our attempt to reconstruct the evolution of the Jbel Amsittene through time, we hypothesize that the Jbel Amsittene Anticline formed in strata overlying a previous half-graben structure bounded by an E-dipping normal fault to the east and an E-W left-lateral strike slip fault to the north (Figs. 1B & 9\n). The latter is shown in the Mesozoic structural map of the Essaouira-Agadir Basin by Le Roy and Piqu\u00e9 (2001), based on seismic data. The presence and relative accommodation space expected from both these pre-existing structures could explain increasing Jurassic thicknesses westwards and northwards along and across anticline strike, respectively (Figs. 7 and 8). We interpret the upwards decreasing thickness in Upper Jurassic units (Fig. 9) as an indication that the aforementioned faults were sealed, at the latest, by the end of the Late Jurassic (rifting kinematics, for both High Atlas and Central Atlantic, end in the Early Jurassic; e.g., Michard et al., 2008). Subsequent Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous folding of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline may have occurred by reactivation of the E-W structure as a blind thrust, as interpreted on the structural map of Hafid et al. (2006) and on their seismic interpretation. This would result in thicknesses that increase towards the hanging-wall, i.e. southwards across the anticline, and are thus opposite in trend with regards to those in the Jurassic units, in agreement with our data (Table 1). Such blind thrust would be rooted in Triassic evaporites, acting as a weak decollement layer between the basement and the overlying Mesozoic basin infill (Fig. 9). Therefore, most of the strain was localised in the depocentre of the Triassic salt found underneath the western part of the Jbel Amsittene and wedging out towards the east. This is coherent with eastwards decreasing strain observed for both the early post-rift and the Alpine shortening phases.\n\n\n4.3\nRegional shortening in other Moroccan sites during anticline growth\nObservations within and nearby the Essaouira-Agadir Basin suggest that some of the other salt structures present in the rifted margin may have been originally formed at earlier times than the Tertiary contraction (e.g., Hafid et al., 2006; Bertotti and Gouiza, 2012; Saura et al., 2013; Benvenuti et al., 2017; Moragas et al., 2018; Pichel et al., 2019a). This could be the case of the Tidsi Anticline and the Imi n\u2019Tanout wedge in the Essaouira-Agadir Basin (Fig. 1B), and the Dad\u00e8s Valley in the Ouarzazate Basin. These structures may have formed similarly to the Jbel Amsittene Anticline, i.e. during an early post-rift shortening phase that reactivated inherited structures in assistance of the Triassic evaporitic rocks (Fig. 9). However, truncation of the basalt horizons by the Pliensbachian unconformity within certain structures also suggest the presence of earlier salt growth (Hafid et al., 2006).\nThe Tidsi Anticline, north of the Jbel Amsittene Anticline (Fig. 1B), was also thought to result from salt diapirism during the Late Cretaceous. The main arguments are the presence of growth strata documented in the Upper Cretaceous rocks and the lack of Jurassic series, coupled with the absence of tectonic indicators associated with these growth features (Amrhar, 1995; Hafid, 2006). While the relevance of diapirism in controlling the growth of the Tidsi Anticline during Late Cretaceous time is not unlikely, other older structures are observed in the area which document the existence of Early Cretaceous tectonic deformations hitherto neglected (Bertotti and Gouiza, 2012). This study also documents that the Late Lower Cretaceous strata in the uppermost part of the outcrop are sub-horizontal, which implies deformation occurred prior to the Late Cretaceous. The tectonic nature of these structures is proven by the fold vergence towards the core of the Tidsi Anticline, which is incompatible with an halokinetic origin.\nTo the east of Jbel Amsittene, the geometry of the post-rift portion of the Imi n\u2019Tanout wedge (Fig. 1B) prior to Alpine shortening has been reconstructed coupling thickness measurements with structural field observations (Z\u00fchlke et al., 2004; Bertotti and Gouiza, 2012). These studies show syn-depositional deformation is common in the Imi n\u2019Tanout wedge at the outcrop scale, and folds and thrusts with a NW-SE trending axis are common. These structures document Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous NE-SW shortening approximately perpendicular to the axis of the Imi n\u2019Tanout wedge suggesting their formation within the same deformation regime. Shortening structures are conformal to the large-scale folds in the northern part of the Essaouira-Agadir Basin that are related to the inversion of the Atlas system.\nIn the Ouarzazate foreland basin, located ca. 300\u202fkm southeast of the Essaouira-Agadir Basin and south of the central High Atlas (Fig. 1A), there is also strong evidence for a pre-Atlasic shortening event (Benvenuti et al., 2017). Observations from the Dad\u00e8s Valley indicate angular and progressive unconformities of syn-tectonic character within the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous stratigraphic units (Benvenuti et al., 2017). This study also documents syn-sedimentary tectonic structures that suggests a first Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous NNE-SSW to NNW-SSE shortening and a later E-W shortening during the Late Cretaceous (Benvenuti et al., 2017).\n\n\n4.4\nVertical motion and horizontal deformation during anticline growth\nA review of the temporal and spatial distribution of the crustal vertical movements has led to the proposal of an overall exhumation\/subsidence history for Morocco and its surroundings (Charton et al., 2018). Present-day basement massifs surrounding the Essaouira-Agadir Basin, i.e. the Anti-Atlas, the Marrakech High Atlas, and the Meseta, have been active sources of sediments throughout the Mesozoic (Fig. 10\n). Specifically, the Anti-Atlas, south of the Jbel Amsittene area, underwent significant exhumation between the Triassic and Middle Jurassic and during the Late Cretaceous to Present-day, while the Meseta and High Atlas massifs were exhumed from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous and towards the end of the Late Cretaceous. This discrepancy in exhumation time led to substantial shifts in source areas, yet to be tested with sedimentary provenance analysis in the Essaouira-Agadir Basin.\nContractional structures in the Cretaceous sedimentary units of the Essaouira-Agadir Basin are coeval with major rearrangements in plate motions related to the opening of the South and North Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 10). Continental separation and accretion of oceanic crust started in the Aptian-Albian time in the South Atlantic (Torsvik et al., 2009), between SW Africa and South America, and in the southern segment of the North Atlantic (Knott et al., 1993; Tucholke et al., 2007), between Iberia and Newfoundland. We propose that the resulting counterclockwise rotation of Africa and the southward drifting of Iberia led to N\u2013S compressive stresses within the African plate. At the same time, the ongoing oceanic accretion and mid-Atlantic ridge push in the Central Atlantic resulted in E-W compressive stresses (e.g., Gouiza et al., 2019). Similarly, another Mesozoic failed rift system between northwest and southern Africa along the Atlantic margin was active in the Early Cretaceous (e.g., Guiraud and Maurin, 1992) that may have triggered N\u2013S far-field stresses in Morocco.\nThe steady acceleration of the Atlantic Mid-Oceanic ridge spreading during the Jurassic period is a known active process in the Central-Atlantic region that may lead to tectonic stresses (Fig. 10C; Labails et al., 2010). Several drivers may have contributed to the Jurassic erosional exhumation: (a) relatively low sea level (e.g., Snedden and Liu, 2010); (b) far-field intraplate stresses by Mid Oceanic Ridge push; (c) positive dynamic topography (up to 100\u202fm of surface uplift; Barnett-Moore et al., 2017) potentially leading to regional instabilities; (d) high paleo-latitudes (similar to those of the Present-day; after Scotese, 2016, Fig. 10C) and; (e) arid to humid climates in the High Atlas during the Early Jurassic (Wilmsen and Neuweiler, 2007). Some of these processes, or some combination of them, may be responsible for the documented exhumation, and could have resulted in the instability and mobilisation of the Triassic salt by erosion of the sedimentary cap, generating hydraulic heads, or the propagation of faults in the salt cap generated by far-field intraplate stresses and\/or surface uplift.\nThe spatial and temporal relation between these contractional structures and the regional uplift event that affected the NW African margin suggest a common genetic process (Ghorbal et al., 2008; Lepr\u00eatre et al., 2015b; Gouiza et al., 2017; Charton et al., 2018). We consider that Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous shortening in the Essaouira-Agadir Basin was driven by these N\u2013S and E-W compressive stresses that reactivated the E-W (High Atlas\/Tethysian failed rift) and N\u2013S (Central Atlantic rift) syn-rift structures alike, and later initiated subsequent salt movements onshore and offshore the Moroccan rifted margin (Hafid et al., 2006; Hafid, 2000, 2006; Tari et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe collected detailed structural evidence in the Jbel Amsittene. Our data indicate that the structure is an asymmetrical and north-verging anticline, with a northern flank that dips steeply and locally overturns, and a southern flank that dips south more gently. Our data suggest that the Jbel Amsittene Anticline is a fault-propagation-fold with its detachment plane rooted in Late Triassic evaporites, and that it initially grew during NNW-SSE shortening by the end of the Late Jurassic. Shortening led to anticline-scale and outcrop-scale syn-tectonic wedges in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous strata and outcrop-scale syn-sedimentary structures indicating compressional stresses. The anticline lacks structures related to diapiric rise at relevant scales and the effect of salt diapirism is restricted locally to an area around the anticline core. We therefore conclude that the initial development of Jbel Amsittene Ancline during Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous times was mainly driven by shortening led by compressional tectonics, and only partially the result of salt tectonics. Later inversion of the Atlas system since the Late Cretaceous caused the tightening of the anticline. Being one of many contemporaneous contractional structures reported in the Essaouira-Agadir Basin and nearby basins linked to crustal-scale Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous exhumation, our observations suggest a tectonic evolution driven by intraplate stresses along the entire NW African margin.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nD.

Structural instability of volcanoes and other orogenic landforms can be prompted by a range of factors such as: magma intrusion (e.g., Mount St. Helens; Lipman and Mullineaux, 1981); overloading of flanks (Swanson et al., 1976), tectonic stresses (Lagmay et al., 2000), ground motion during earthquakes (Voight and Elsworth, 1997), hydrothermal activity (Day, 1996; Voight and Elsworth, 1997), alteration (Reid, 2004), precipitation (McGuire, 1996), freeze-thaw (Kawamura and Miura, 2013), and erosion (McGuire, 1996). This is combined with a natural variability in coherency, porosity, crystallinity and glass content of materials, which affects the strength and primary deformation mode (e.g., brittle vs ductile) of the edifice-forming rocks (e.g. Heap et al., 2010; Benson et al., 2012). Collapses of unstable volcanic structures occur at a wide range of scales, the smallest examples form from shallow slope instability events (Cecchi et al., 2004) and rockfalls (Calder et al., 2002), whereas larger scale instabilities can produce deep-seated slip events that may subject magmatic systems to decompression that triggers unrest and even eruptions (e.g. Hunt et al., 2018).\nLarge-scale collapse landslides pose significant hazards to life and property within the spatial range of the event (e.g. Siebert, 1992). Quantifying the potential distance these collapses may travel, the rate at which onset occurs and the speed of the avalanche itself as it propagates from the source area is therefore paramount in hazard risk assessments. Large landslide volumes can exceed 109\u00a0m3 (Siebert, 1984) and travel at speeds up to 100\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 (Siebert et al., 1987; Shea and van Wyk de Vries, 2008) and those with volumes in excess of 106\u00a0m3 often exhibit anomalously high mobility (Scheidegger, 1973). Mobility considers a combination of velocity and runout distance from source (Iverson et al., 2015), which can often be greater than ten times the height of fall (the elevation change from source to final position of the mass of material) in these instances (Legros, 2002). Analysis of the ratio of height of fall to runout distance against volume of landslides highlights that landslides with larger volumes travel longer distances, suggesting the importance of a mechanism that acts to lower frictional coefficients, allowing them to be more mobile than predicted by simple frictional sliding models (Shea and van Wyk de Vries, 2008). Such behaviour has been identified in events developing in all rock types (Legros, 2002 and references therein), suggesting a commonality of the process. Several mechanisms to reduce frictional coefficients during frictional sliding of landslides have been put forth, including: mechanical fluidisation (Davies, 1982; Campbell et al., 1995), the lubricating effects of basal groundwater or ice (Lucchitta, 1987; Legros, 2002; De Blasio, 2011), trapped air (Shreve, 1968), salt (De Blasio, 2011), acoustic fluidisation (Melosh, 1979, 1986; Johnson et al., 2016), mechanical and thermal fluid pressurisation (e.g. Ferri et al., 2011) elastohydrodynamic lubrication (Brodsky and Kanamori, 2001), frictional velocity weakening (e.g. Wang et al., 2017) and the formation of a lubricating frictional melt layer (Legros et al., 2000; De Blasio and Elverh\u00f8i, 2008; Wang et al., 2017).\nThe production of frictional melts is the result of frictional heating due to strain localisation onto a discrete, thin slipping layer (Sibson, 1975). These frictional melts are then preserved in the geological record as pseudotachylytes, often resulting from seismogenic fault activity (Sibson, 1975, 1977; Spray, 1992; Shimamoto and Lin, 1994; Di Toro et al., 2006; Nielsen et al., 2008), shear localisation in volcanic conduits (e.g. Kendrick et al., 2012), and at the basal contacts of some mass movements (Erismann, 1979; Masch et al., 1985; Legros et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2001; Hacker et al., 2014; Bernard and van Wyk de Vries, 2017). The presence of frictional melts along fault slip zones has often been suggested to act as a lubricant (Di Toro et al., 2006); yet, they may conversely act as a viscous brake (Fialko and Khazan, 2005), especially in intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks sheared at low (<10\u00a0MPa) normal stresses or low lithostatic loads (Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2012; Kendrick et al., 2014; Hornby et al., 2015). Importantly, the transient physico-chemical evolution of frictional melt during slip impacts rheological evolution (Lin and Shimamoto, 1998; Wallace et al., 2019), which controls slip velocity, shear resistance and any thermo-mechanical feedback due to viscous energy dissipation (Nielsen et al., 2010) that, in the case of mass movements, may ultimately regulate the runout distance.\nCareful examination of the internal structures of mass movement deposits, such as large landslides (including debris avalanches), suggests a spectrum of behaviour; from those which disaggregate during transport to those transported over long distances whilst maintaining their coherence, exhibited by undisturbed structures such as discrete lithological units and intrusions (Glicken, 1998; Erismann and Abele, 2001; Hacker et al., 2014). Some evidence suggests that larger events have preserved their internal structures (Erismann and Abele, 2001; De Blasio and Elverh\u00f8i, 2008). In order to preserve these features, shear must have been localised to a relatively narrow layer to prevent wholescale deformation. Shear localisation is an integral part of flow segregation and means that the basal mechanisms of debris avalanches and volcanic collapses largely control emplacement. On this layer, shear rates (and thus frictional heating) may be extremely high as a result of the high velocity of the mass movement (De Blasio and Elverh\u00f8i, 2008). Pseudotachylytes have only been identified at the base of a few landslides, including: Kofels, Austria (Erismann, 1979); Langtang, Nepal (Masch et al., 1985); Tsaoling, Taiwan (Lin et al., 2001); Markagunt slide, Utah (Hacker et al., 2014), Sevier slide, Utah (Biek et al., 2019), French Massif Central (Bernard and van Wyk de Vries, 2017) and Arequipa, Peru (Legros et al., 2000). The Arequipa volcanic landslide deposit displays a rare example of preserved pseudotachylyte at the base of a landslide originating from a volcanic source, namely Pichu Pichu volcano. The internal structure of the deposit is exposed owing to multiple incisions by rivers since emplacement >1\u00a0Ma ago (Legros et al., 2000). Here we present new observations from an extensive geological survey of the Arequipa volcanic landslide deposit, including re-examination of the original outcrops investigated in Legros et al. (2000) as well as newly identified shear exposures.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nPichu Pichu is part of the modern Central Andean Volcanic Zone and is located along the NE margin of the Arequipa basin, 30\u00a0km to the east of the city of Arequipa (Fig. 1\n). The volcanic arc trends approximately NW-SE, associated with major regional sinistral strike-slip faults trending NW-SE (de Silva and Francis, 1990; Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2009). The Arequipa basin is filled with four distinct, high-K calc-alkaline ignimbrites commonly referred to as the \u201cSillar\u201d (Lebti et al., 2006). These range in age from the 13.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0Ma Rio Chili Ignimbrite to the 1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0Ma Yura Tuff (Lebti et al., 2006). The source of these ignimbrites has been inferred to evidence a relict volcanic caldera now buried by the construction of Chachani volcanic complex during the quaternary (in the last 1\u00a0Ma to 642 ka; Aguilar Contreras et al., 2016). Similarly, the ignimbrites underlie the younger Arequipa volcanic landslide deposit (Legros et al., 2000; Lebti et al., 2006) estimated to have occurred at ~1\u00a0Ma (Lebti et al., 2006).\nPichu Pichu itself is an extinct volcanic complex with andesitic lava flows dated to 6.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57\u00a0Ma using K-Ar dating (Kaneoka and Guevara, 1984) with no evidence of younger activity. The collapse of a significant portion of the volcanic flank resulted in the formation of an open arcuate ridge morphology, facing the large volcanic debris avalanche deposit found to the east of Arequipa (Fig. 1). Initially the deposit was mapped to extend to the NE of Arequipa, however further investigation of those deposits found that the chemistry of entrained lava blocks and flow package characteristics more closely correlate to lava flows from an earlier cone of El Misti that underwent collapse before the formation of the modern day cone (Thouret et al., 2001). These more recent flows partially overlie and obscure the older collapse deposits now interpreted to originate from Pichu Pichu. More recently the northern boundary of the debris flow deposit was re-mapped in the area of Chiguata to follow the break in slope between the flank of El Misti and the irregular topography identified as the Pichu Pichu collapse formation (Thouret et al., 2001). The debris avalanche deposit has been stated to evidence both mixed and block facies using nomenclature of Glicken (1991), and has a basal pseudotachylyte (Legros et al., 2000), but has not been mapped in detail (Thouret et al., 2001).\n\n\n3\nMethods\nThe debris avalanche deposit was surveyed in 2017. Topographic maps were used to identify valleys and gullies that would be potential sites for basal exposures using the relative altitudes from the previously identified basal contact (Legros et al., 2000) at 2600\u00a0m above sea level. Where basal contacts were located, we also examined the debris avalanche deposit above for internal flow features.\nSamples were collected from several localities; for basal contacts samples were generally taken from above, below and within the shear zone. For all samples, flow direction was noted (determined from the position from source, clast imbrication and striations if present) in the field and ascribed to each specimen to enable structural analysis. Orientated, polished thin sections were used for both microtextural and geochemical analyses. Backscattered electron images (BSE) used for microtextural analysis were taken on a Phillips XL30 scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the University of Liverpool with 20\u00a0kV accelerating voltage and 10\u00a0\u03bcm working distance.\nBulk chemistry was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) at the University of Leicester using a PANalytical Axios Advanced XRF Spectrometer. Major element analyses were determined from glass beads fused from ignited powders and trace elements on pressed powder pellets. Relative precision and accuracy were better than 1.5% for major elements and 5% for trace elements based on a series of repeat analyses on reference materials (Bardon Hill granodiorite and Whin Sill dolerite; see supplementary materials).\nThe geochemical compositions of phases in the underlying ignimbrite, pseudotachylytes, cataclasites and lithic clasts from within the debris avalanche were measured using a Cameca SX100 electron probe micro-analyser (EPMA) at the University of Manchester, using wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). Calibration of the detectors were conducted on a range of standards (albite for Si and Na, wollastonite for Ca, fayalite for Fe, corundum for Al, ilmenite for Ti, periclase for Mg, tephrite for Mn and potassium feldspar for K). These standards were revisited at the start of each working day, although the albite standard and the VG568 rhyolite glass standard (Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming) were revisited regularly during analyses and before and after each sample to ensure there was no drift. Measurements on crystals were conducted with a focused ~1\u00a0\u03bcm beam with 20\u00a0nA current and 15\u00a0kV accelerating voltage. Analyses conducted on pseudotachylyte and interstitial glass in lithic clasts were conducted using a defocused 10\u00a0\u03bcm beam with 5\u00a0nA current and 15\u00a0kV accelerating voltage. Additionally, a defocused beam was also used to sample the bulk chemistry of areas of ultracataclasite. All tests with both focused and defocused beam had peak count times of 20\u00a0s and background (off peak) of 10\u00a0s.\nIn an attempt to obtain accurate and precise glass chemistries and minimise potential contamination from common restites (surviving crystals) in the pseudotachylyte glass, a 5\u00a0\u03bcm beam was also used for 6 analyses; they were found to return similar totals and chemistries to analyses done with the 10\u00a0\u03bcm beam.\nIn order to perform a rheological analysis of the frictional melt, the chemical composition obtained by EPMA was used as input in the GRD viscosity calculator (Giordano et al., 2008). ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012) was employed to analyse phases in BSE images and estimate the crystal fraction as well as a maximum packing fraction, calculated following Mueller et al. (2010) and Klein et al. (2017). This data was input into the empirical relative viscosity calculator of Costa et al. (2009) to compute the rheology of the frictional melt suspensions.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nField observations\nDuring our field campaign, we surveyed the Arequipa volcanic landslide deposit and closely examined key structures. The deposit is characterised by a heavily eroded area of high topography extending 26\u00a0km west from Pichu Pichu in a broad, fan-like shape (Fig. 1). The upper surface of the deposit is draped by fall deposits of more recent volcanic activity in the area. Legros et al. (2000) originally estimated the volume of the deposit to be\u00a0>10 km3, however, with the deposit covering around 200\u00a0km2 and thicknesses observed at >100\u00a0m even at distances >20\u00a0km from the source, the volume could exceed even 20\u00a0km3. Outcrops of the basal contact suggest a gentle 5\u00b0 average slope of the original underlying topography. Current topography indicates that the central section of the deposit exceeds 300\u00a0m in thickness. An accurate estimation of the volume in this case is impossible due to the unknown basal topography, erosion of the deposit, poor mapping of the distal extent and a number of overlying fall deposits.\nThe deposit is cut by multiple rivers and their tributaries, including the Rio Socabaya in which localities 2 and 3 are found (Fig. 1). Locality 1 is situated in a different river-cutting near the Characato District. These incisions expose some of the internal flow structures developed during the debris avalanche. Here, we describe observations of key structures from three localities with extensive exposure. These include basal contacts, defining the paleotopography, as well as mid-body shear zones and clastic dykes.\n\n4.1.1\nLocality 1 \u2013 basal pseudotachylyte\nOriginally, the base of the debris avalanche deposit was observed in a river-cutting near Characato District to the SE of Arequipa (Legros et al., 2000), approximately 24\u00a0km from Pichu Pichu (Loc.1 see Fig. 1). Here, the exposure presented by the river-cut is approximately 75\u00a0m long and 10\u00a0m high approximately parallel to the expected transport direction (Fig. 2\na\u2013b). Although the deposit extends further in all directions, vegetation covers most of the rocks on shallow topography. In this locality, the debris avalanche deposit is rather massive, made of a white-grey, granular medium consisting primarily of ash- and lapilli-size clasts of andesite lithics and individual crystals (Fig. 2a\u2013b). The andesite blocks are porphyritic, containing 20% plagioclase (up to 2.2\u00a0mm), 15.3% amphibole phenocrysts (up to 2\u00a0mm), rarer pyroxene phenocrysts and a microlite-rich groundmass. The andesite blocks occasionally reach 30\u00a0cm in size within the deposit and often display jigsaw brecciation fracture patterns.\nThe underlying ignimbrite is exposed as a poorly consolidated and highly weathered rock of pale grey colour consisting of ash-sized grains without large lapilli. Crystals of both biotite and plagioclase are identifiable alongside dark lithic fragments but all are rarely larger than 1\u00a0mm in size. The rock is highly fractured and contains non-continuous veins of silicic hydrothermal material up to 1\u00a0cm thick (Fig. 2c\u2013d). These veins all follow a similar orientation, striking in a 014\u2013020 direction with high dip angles of 80-90\u00b0 to the east, following the orientation of regional tectonic features (Lebti et al., 2006).\nThe contact between the debris deposit and the underlying basal ignimbrite is sharp, consisting of a thin, dark grey, vitreous layer approximately 1\u20131.5\u00a0cm thick (Fig. 2c\u2013d). The contact is observed at an elevation of 2610\u20132620\u00a0m in the northern face of the river-cutting and is dipping away from the outcrop face towards the north (strike 090 and 091) at variable angles, but generally around 35\u00b0(Fig. 2a\u2013b). The contact visibly extends over a length of ca. 60 m and is curvilinear, increasing in elevation by approximately 4\u20135\u00a0m over a distance of approximately 10\u00a0m away from Pichu Pichu at this locality. Over-hanging areas of the upper slip surface at the base of the deposit exhibit striations trending 286\u00b0 which deviates approximately 25\u00b0 north from the expected flow direction. The material either side of the contact is highly brecciated, containing no fragments larger than 4\u00a0cm within 50\u00a0cm of the contact.\n\n\n4.1.2\nLocality 1 \u2013 intra-body shear zone\nStrain localisation was not restricted to the basal contact at Loc. 1. An additional shear zone was identified within the deposit, some 20\u00a0m above the basal contact at 2636\u00a0m elevation and 30\u00a0m due NE from the basal contact previously described. Here, a change in colour is noted above and below the shear zone. The lower unit is a pale grey colour, fine-grained breccia, similar to that described directly above the basal contact but with rare larger (>20\u00a0cm) andesitic blocks. Above is a breccia with red-coloured matrix, rich in andesitic blocks (Fig. 2e\u2013f). The clasts in this upper lithology are larger, up to 50\u00a0cm, with less jigsaw brecciation and more angular shapes. These two units are separated by a layer of light brown material with no large clasts that varies from 2 to 10\u00a0cm thick and which is seen to inject into the lithology above. Within this, there is a thin layer of dark, microcrystalline material, approximately 3\u20134\u00a0mm thick (Fig. 2e\u2013f). The shear zone is observed to extend laterally for approximately 45\u00a0m and runs sub-parallel to the basal contact below at a strike of 108\u00b0 dipping to the north by ~20\u00b0.\n\n\n4.1.3\nLocality 2 \u2013 cataclastic basal contact\nA new exposure of the deposit base was found to the northeast of the original locality in a different river valley, approximately 17.5\u00a0km from Pichu Pichu (Loc. 2 see Fig. 1). Here, the materials forming the debris avalanche deposit and the underlying ignimbrite remain the same as in Loc. 1, yet the upper surface of the ignimbrite is, in some laterally discontinuous sections, draped by a 1\u20132\u00a0m thick layer of more clay rich, lahar deposit material with some imbrication of small clasts. The nature of the contact is however different and varies laterally within the outcrop, which totals approximately 300\u00a0m along a river-cutting (Fig. 3\n). The contact, observed at an elevation of 2854\u20132858\u00a0m, is seen in the north face of the river-cutting, near-parallel to the flow direction and is generally linear and almost horizontal (Fig. 3a\u2013b). It is largely visible as a sharp boundary between the two units (with either the thin lahar layer or ignimbrite as the lower unit). A large clast is preserved near the base of the debris avalanche, cut by multiple well-defined fractures parallel to the primary contact (Fig. 3c\u2013d). In this locality, no vitreous layer is present, but the shear zone contains extremely fragmented, fine, angular material and displays red iron oxide stains and 303\u00b0 trending striations on the lower contact surface with the lahar (Fig. 3c\u2013d). This is a more northerly direction of flow, due to the fanning of the deposit across the land surface.\n140\u00a0m to the west, separated from the previously described outcrop by an area of vegetation, an undulating contact is visible between the debris flow and the ignimbrite material where troughs were present in the paleotopography (i.e., the upper surface of the ignimbrite; Fig. 3e\u2013f). The deposit filled the depression and exhibits diffusely distributed alignment of material (akin to inclined sub-parallel laminations) up to a sharp slip surface that crosscuts the debris avalanche deposit (Fig. 3e\u2013f). Here, the base of a >2\u00a0m large andesitic clast is flat and parallel to the primary slip surface, showing signs of a throughgoing, bisecting rupture. No vitreous layer is present in the shear zone at this locality.\n\n\n4.1.4\nLocality 3 \u2013 intra-body shear zone and clastic dykes\nIn the Rio Socabaya gorge (Loc. 3 see Fig. 1), river incision exposes a >800\u00a0m long, up to 100\u00a0m high section of the debris avalanche deposit on both sides of the river valley. Here, the deposit is made of a massive, white-grey, granular medium consisting primarily of ash- and lapilli-size clasts of andesite lithics and crystals. However, in this locality, rare larger blocks of andesite were observed in the deposit up to 3\u20134\u00a0m in size. There is no visible basal contact between the facies identified, though the ignimbrite is exposed approximately 200\u00a0m to the west. Instead, the main rock mass exhibits multiple clastic dykes as well as intra-body shear zones some 5\u201310\u00a0m above the river bottom. The structurally-lowest shear zone, identified at the western end of the southern bank, developed within the main body of rock and does not separate disparate units within the debris avalanche deposit (Fig. 4\n). The shear zone appears as a linear feature marked by a thin, microcrystalline layer some 0.5\u00a0cm thick and extending over a length of approximately 5\u00a0m. The layer is not straight, but rather undulose. There is no discernible variation in clast shape or size in relation to the shear zone, though it is often obscured by vegetation. A few metres to the west of the end of the visible shear zone there is a clastic dyke, 2\u00a0m thick and >10\u00a0m high intruding sub-vertically into the deposit.\nMultiple clastic dykes have been injected into the debris deposit from below, though the source of the material is not observed in the field. These structures range in size from 10\u00a0cm to 2\u20133\u00a0m in thickness and reach up to several tens of metres in length (Fig. 5\na\u2013b). The thickness of the larger clastic dykes changes along their length, generally tapering towards their tips. Most of the dykes are sub-vertical, but there are several occurrences of sections of dykes, locally projecting horizontally around large, metre-scale clasts. The edges are sharp with the deposit, and material entrained in the clastic dykes varies in size and prevalence. The majority of the dykes contain predominantly fine-grained clastic material with small lithic clasts (mostly andesitic) and crystal fragments. In one case, a dyke contained over 50% mass of clasts (in a fine-grained groundmass), varying in composition and 1\u201330\u00a0cm in size. The margins of this dyke are devoid of large clasts, are fine-grained and show evidence of laminar shear banding (Fig. 5c\u2013d). In other cases, the dykes do not show evidence of internal strain localisation or gradational deposition. The dykes are intact and do not exhibit any offset, anticipated from post-emplacement shear within the bulk of the avalanche, indicative of their late stage occurrence.\nA second site observed in the same river valley is a shear zone consisting of a near-planar feature through the deposit exposed on the inside bend of the southern bank. This shear zone is approximately 25\u00a0m in length, with no discernible variation in lithology on either side. There is an observed reduction of the number of clasts above 3\u00a0cm in a layer 20\u00a0cm in thickness above the planar feature (Fig. 6\n), though intermittent large clasts up to 50\u00a0cm in size are present. At this shear zone the planar feature is additionally highlighted by its interaction with the clastic dykes. A dyke propagating from below terminates at the shear zone, increasing in width from 1\u00a0m to 3\u00a0m\u00a0at the intersection, visible in the outcrop and extending several metres along the shear plane, gradually pinching out. 3 m to the west of the large clastic dyke, another dyke, 30\u00a0cm in width cuts across the planar shear zone into the unit above (Fig. 6).\n\n\n\n4.2\nMicrostructural analysis\nThin sections of sheared samples were made perpendicular to shear and parallel to the slip vector. Micro-textural analysis was performed using optical microscopy and BSE imagery.\n\n4.2.1\nLocality 1 \u2013 pseudotachylyte basal contact\nMicrotextural analysis of the basal contact at Loc. 1 reveals that the dark layer observed at outcrop scale comprises a 12\u00a0mm thick vitreous layer with ~3\u00a0mm thick undulose, and diffuse boundaries at the top and bottom to cataclasites, which contain lithic clasts of bounding lithologies up to 2\u00a0mm in size (Fig. 7\n).\nVisual observation of the central dark vitreous layer shows that it is made of a mix of tortuous (fluidal) black isotropic filaments (in plane-polarised light), up to 0.7\u00a0mm thick and 5\u00a0mm long, and a large fraction (around 40%) of a dark brown material consisting of identifiable small rock fragments and crystals (Fig. 7). SEM image analysis reveals the black isotropic filaments to be bubble-bearing material with no identifiable crystal structure (Fig. 8\n). Later EPMA analysis produced consistent chemistry, ruling out the presence of small crystals. Therefore, as identified in Legros et al. (2000), the isotropic black material is interpreted to be glass, with interspersed ultracataclastic, crystal-rich dark brown material. The glass filaments contain varying fractions of vesicles (Fig. 8a\u2013b) which are up to 8\u00a0\u03bcm in size and occasionally elongated in the direction of en-echelon alignment of the melt filaments. Where preserved around large clasts, elongate vesicles form trails following the direction of shearing. Within the filaments, small, rounded patches of silica (5\u00a0\u03bcm) are observed.\nIn the brown material the crystals are predominantly plagioclase feldspar up to 0.6\u00a0mm in size with a modal size <0.4\u00a0mm. They show as equant fragments with multiple fractures. Additionally, smaller pyroxene crystals and occasional hornblende (<0.1\u00a0mm) are observed but are concentrated on the outer edges of the dark, vitreous layer. SEM image analysis reveals that the larger clasts have extensive cracking (Fig. 8d) but remain together forming a brecciated texture. The fractured and sheared plagioclase crystals (Fig. 8a and c) form elongate layers of plagioclase-dominated fragments.\nThe layering between pseudotachylyte glass and ultracataclasite follows Riedel shear bands concordant with the shear in the flow direction (Fig. 7). The darker, glass-rich filaments are more predominant in the centre of the layer and are absent from the bounding cataclasite. In these marginal cataclastic zones (separating glass layer from the andesite above and ignimbrite below), we observed large clasts consisting of fragments of mixed vesicular pseudotachylyte-ultracataclasite banded materials (pst in Fig. 8e\u2013f), similar in texture to the intact vitreous layer. The fragments are further fractured (showing trivial offset) and the margins are sub-angular.\n\n\n4.2.2\nLocality 1 \u2013 intra-body shear surface\nThe intra-body shear plane approximately 20\u00a0m above the basal contact at Loc. 1 is dominated by the presence of clasts and microcrystalline material. The visibly pale layer in the outcrop is a poorly sorted clast rich cataclasite, the dark vitreous layer is denser ultracataclasite welded with small amounts of amorphous material between grain contacts (Fig. 9\na). The largest clasts observed here are andesitic, 5\u20136\u00a0mm in size and semi-rounded, which are larger than the clasts near to the basal contact hosting frictional melt (section 4.2.1). Smaller crystal fragments, primarily of plagioclase are also present (Fig. 9b). In addition, the contact between the cataclasite and the thin, denser ultracataclasite layer is sharp (Fig. 9b\u2013c).\n\n\n4.2.3\nLocality 1 \u2013 basal ignimbrite\nAnalysis of the ignimbrite below the contact at Loc. 1 found that the formation is rich in similar sized anhedral plagioclase and sanidine crystals, commonly 1\u20132\u00a0mm in size and up to 3\u00a0mm with occasional smaller quartz and biotite crystals up to a maximum of 1\u00a0mm in size (Fig. 10\na). The plagioclase and sanidine crystals occasionally form glomerocrysts containing a combination of the two most abundant phenocryst types. These crystals are hosted in a matrix of small needle-shaped glass shards, (<0.5\u00a0mm). In the sample collected there is no evident welding of the material, which has high porosity. The crystal assemblage matches that described for the La Joya Ignimbrite formation mapped within the Arequipa basin infill, which is thought to extend across the whole area below the debris avalanche deposit (Lebti et al., 2006).\n\n\n4.2.4\nLocality 2 \u2013 cataclastic basal contact\nFrom the basal contact at Locality 2, there is no evidence of the localisation of shear onto a single zone. Instead, the material across a band of approximately 40\u00a0cm thickness is formed of highly fractured lithic and crystalline fragments and clasts hosted in a matrix of clay (Fig. 10c) with no evidence of glass. Larger lithic fragments, ranging in size from <1\u00a0mm up to 7\u201310\u00a0mm in size, are identifiable as andesitic in composition with similar crystal content as clasts from Loc. 1, with abundant sub-euhedral plagioclase (<1\u00a0mm) and subhedral amphibole phenocrysts (<0.8\u00a0mm). Plagioclase forms the largest of the crystalline fragments in the shear zone, though small, subangular, amphibole and biotite crystals around 1\u00a0mm in size are also observed in the cataclasite. Several large pumiceous clasts up to ~4\u00a0cm in size are also preserved within the shear zone with only minor fracturing. These pumiceous clasts contain plagioclase, sanidine and biotite. Small fragments are often monocrystalline, commonly plagioclase up to 2\u00a0mm in size. The orientation of these fragments shows no evidence of Riedel shearing and there are no pervasive shear fabrics observed within the cataclasite.\n\n\n4.2.5\nLocality 3 - clastic dyke\nA sample of a large clastic dyke in the northern face exposure at Loc. 3 is observed to contain considerable fractured glassy pumice fragments, andesite clasts (up to 7\u00a0mm in thin section though field observations indicate larger clasts are present), individual crystals of plagioclase and a high clay content (Fig. 10b). Additionally, some biotite (tabular, up to 1\u00a0mm) is present, which is not observed in the lithologies of the debris avalanche but is observed in the ignimbrite and cataclastic basal shear zone.\n\n\n\n4.3\nGeochemical analysis\nGeochemical analysis was performed to reconcile physico-chemical processes associated with the evolution of shear and frictional melting. XRF analysis was used to constrain the chemical composition of the host rocks, confirming the andesitic nature of the avalanche deposit and the rhyolitic chemistry of the ignimbrite (Fig. 11\n, see supplementary data).\nEPMA was conducted on several mineral phases from host rocks and crystal fragments and amorphous areas from the basal layer at Loc. 1 to constrain the development of frictional melting (with respect to the host lithologies). The plagioclase crystals in the vitreous layer as well as in andesite lithics within the ultracataclasite and ignimbrite host wall rock are compositionally grouped (Fig. 11), with CaO ranging from 6 to 9\u00a0wt% and NaO from 6 to 8\u00a0wt% (see supplementary data). Amphibole crystals in lithic fragments as well as rare individual crystals in the ultracataclasite at Loc. 1 were found to be compositionally similar and were absent in the vitreous layer (Fig. 11, see supplementary data). The two types of pyroxene present in the andesite, cataclasite and vitreous layer, were identified as augite (clinopyroxene; Ca-rich) and enstatite (orthopyroxene; Mg-Fe rich).\nGlasses in both the preserved vitreous layer and in a fragment of glass-bearing material found in the cataclasite were analysed (Fig. 8). The EPMA chemical composition of glass from the basal pseudotachylyte plots between the XRF bulk chemistry of the underlying ignimbrite and the andesitic blocks from the debris avalanche deposit (Fig. 11). The glass however tends to be enriched in SiO2, plotting closer to the composition of the ignimbrite than that of the andesite. In contrast, the glass fragments preserved in the marginal cataclasite of the basal shear zone spans a wider range in chemistry that is notably more mafic in composition. The glass in these pseudotachylyte fragments has less CaO wt% and SiO2 wt% than either the andesite or the ignimbrite (Fig. 11b). Analyses on the ultracataclasite within the layer returned poor totals with highly varying chemistries, suggesting sampling of mixed lithology fragments.\n\n\n\n5\nInterpretation\nThe field, microstructural and geochemical data can be used to make several interpretations about the mechanics of shearing within the debris avalanche.\n\n5.1\nIntergranular forces and fragmentation\nThe contrasting nature of the different basal shear zone exposures provide clues as to the emplacement mechanisms. At the basal contact at Loc. 1, we do not observe large andesitic clasts within 5\u00a0m of the contact and there is evidence of intense brecciation (Fig. 2). In comparison, at Loc. 2 we observe a number of large andesitic clasts, up to metre scale in close proximity to the basal shear localisation zone (Fig. 3). This suggests greater intergranular forces may have occurred near the base of the flow at Loc. 1 compared to Loc. 2 that exceed the elastic limit of the clasts (Davies and McSaveney, 2009), resulting in intense fracturing and reduction in clast and particle sizes (Arabnia and Sklar, 2016). This qualitative observation can also be made at a smaller scale within the shear localisation zone itself, where centimetre-scale clasts at Loc. 2 have survived (in comparison to the smaller fragments in the glass-bearing layer at Loc. 1). Some of these fragments are pumiceous (Fig. 10c) material that, due to their highly vesicular nature, would be mechanically weaker than other crystalline and lithic fragments. Their survival means that there was less cataclastic damage associated with this shear zone. The inferred greater intergranular forces at Loc. 1 also enhances the ability for frictional heating (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959) that can lead to melting. In support of this, biotite and amphibole fragments present in the cataclasite (Figs. 9 & 10c) are absent in the vitreous pseudotachylyte (Figs. 7 and 8), suggestive of selective melting of the mineral assemblage due to the lower fracture toughness and melting temperature of these phases (Spray, 2010).\n\n\n5.2\nTransient nature of slip zones and slip zone morphology\nDespite the deposit only preserving the cumulative history and final state of the debris avalanche, there is evidence to suggest the temporal evolution of the basal shear zones during the flow of the debris avalanche. At Loc. 1, the presence of glassy fragments in the cataclasite bounding the glass-bearing pseudotachylyte layer (Figs. 7 & 8e-f) suggests that there were at least two melting events. The \u201cglass in layer\u201d and \u201cglass in fragments\u201d have different textures and chemistry (Figs. 8 and 11) so either formed from different mixtures of material in the basal shear zone or under different temperatures, timescales and slip conditions. The original layer became fractured and subsequently a new layer comprising ultracataclasite and pseudotachylyte was formed. This process may have occurred multiple times throughout deposition. The development of a secondary slip layer at this locality was likely a late stage development, potentially induced by the slowing of the lower portion of the flow by loss of momentum and interaction with topography.\nSimilarly, at Loc. 2, the initially rough topography of the basal contact is cut through by a secondary linear contact (Fig. 3e\u2013f) suggesting gradational shifts in slip rate or overburden to localise slip to different surfaces at different times. Additionally, multiple fractures splay from these surfaces and cross-cut within the shear zone (Fig. 3c\u2013d) suggesting distinct ruptures.\nWithin the body of the avalanche deposit at Loc. 3, clastic dykes interact with a linear localised shear plane (Fig. 6). The dyke is wider and contains evidence of shear at the contact with the shear plane, indicating it may have terminated at the shear zone during active slip on that contact. In contrast a second clastic dyke at this locality injects through the preserved linear shear plane and is not subjected to any displacement along the shear plane. Therefore, this dyke must have occurred after shearing on this secondary shear plane ceased. This interaction of dykes and shear surfaces is additional evidence supporting the transient nature of active shear surfaces both at the base and within the flow.\n\n\n5.3\nMelt chemistry and source rocks\nThe chemical analyses for the frictional melt glass at Loc. 1 plot between the two bulk rock chemistries of the lower ignimbrite and andesitic upper plate material (Fig. 11). This suggests that a combination of both materials, initially incorporated and sheared in the basal zone, melted to form the glass preserved in the intact basal shear zone.\nThe more mafic composition of the analysed frictional melt glass fragments within the cataclasite (Fig. 11a), interpreted as remnants of a previous melt-producing shear zone, is likely due to early melting of amphibole and biotite (present in the host rocks and cataclasites). This is also supported by the highly vesicular nature of these fragments, as melting of hydrous phases releases water (e.g. Magloughlin, 2011). Primitive or partial frictional melts are frequently more mafic than more mature melts (Wallace et al., 2019 and references therein) and leave suspended survivor clasts of minerals with higher fracture toughness and\/or melting temperature (Spray, 2010). Further melting of the more resistant minerals brings the melt chemistry back towards the bulk chemistry, as seen here with the chemistry of the intact basal pseudotachylyte composition which plots between the andesite and ignimbrite.\n\n\n5.4\nFrictional melt rheology evolution\nUnderstanding the development and impact of frictional melting on the debris avalanche requires consideration of its rheology. Here the observations that slip caused frictional melting as well as fragmentation of frictional melt are used to constrain conditions in the debris avalanche during runout. We used the geochemical compositions of the glass (from the preserved layer and the fragment of glass-bearing earlier melt identified within the bounding cataclasite, both from the basal contact at Loc. 1) as input parameters in the GRD viscosity calculator of Giordano et al. (2008) to constrain the temperature (T in Kelvin) dependence of the viscosity (\u03b7 in Pa s) of the early frictional melt present in fragments (\u03b7\n\ne\n) and late frictional melt forming the main basal pseudotachylyte (\u03b7\n\nl\n):\n\n(1)\n\n\nl\no\ng\n\n\u03b7\ne\n\n=\nA\n+\n\nB\n\nT\n\n(\nK\n)\n\n\u2212\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n provides the values of A, B and C (where B and C are adjustable parameters controlled by composition and A is a constant independent of composition related to the viscosity at infinite temperature, see Giordano et al. (2008)) to model both melts (Fig. 12\na). The chemical compositions vary significantly locally due to the presence of small unhomogenised melt filaments (schlieren), which would have contrasting rheologies. However, the chemical compositions input do not include the water concentrations which would have likely been transiently present in the frictional melts owing to the presence of amphibole in the host rock (e.g. Wallace et al., 2019). Here, we assume the melt phase contained a nominal 0.1\u00a0wt% water concentration in this low-pressure environment.\nThe frictional melts described here contain variable fractions of suspended crystals and bubbles, known to impact the rheology and contribute to a non-Newtonian behaviour (Caricchi et al., 2007; Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2007; Truby et al., 2015; Coats et al., 2018). Here we consider the influence of crystals (i.e., fraction, shape and maximum packing) using the two-phase rheology calculator from Costa et al. (2009). We first constrained the solid fraction present in the pseudotachylyte (i.e., surviving crystals and lithics) via SEM image analysis using the ImageJ online toolbox (Schneider et al., 2012). We estimated the solid fraction in the early pseudotachylyte at 0.25 and late pseudotachylyte at 0.43 and the aspect ratio of the particles as 1.761 in the early and 1.684 in the late pseudotachylyte. Then, following guidelines from Mueller et al. (2010), we used the aspect ratio of the solid fraction to define a critical maximum packing of a monodisperse distribution \n(\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\nm\n\n\n)\n for both suspensions at 0.57. However, due to the polydispersivity (\u03b4) of the solid fraction, the true maximum packing is higher. We used the method of Phan et al. (1998) to define the polydispersivity where \n\n\u03b4\n=\n\n\n\nr\n\ns\nd\n\n\nr\n\n\n where r\n\nsd\n is the standard deviation of the fragment radii (3.00 and 2.71 for the fragment and layer respectively) and \n\nr\n\n is the mean of the fragment radii (3.66 and 3.67 for the fragment and layer respectively). This is based on measurements from 205 particles from the glass bearing fragment and 417 particles in the preserved layer over an analysis area of 200 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm2 respectively (see supplementary data). Subsequently, the polydispersivity in the fragment \n\n\n(\n\n\u03b4\ne\n\n)\n\n\n and later preserved layer \n\n\n(\n\n\u03b4\nl\n\n)\n\n\n pseudotachylytes were input into the fitting equation from Klein et al. (2017) substituting the monodisperse maximum packing of spheres \n\n\n(\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\n0\n\n\n)\n\n\n for our previously defined monodisperse packing of the solid fraction's aspect ratio \n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\nm\n\n\n=\n0.57\n\n)\n\n.\n\n This defines the true maximum packing of the solid fraction of the early fragment \n\n\n(\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\ne\n\n\n)\n\n\n and late preserved layer \n\n\n(\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\nl\n\n\n)\n\n\n such that:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\nm\n\n\n\n)\n\n\ne\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4\ne\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\nm\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese geometrical parameters were then used in the Costa et al. (2009) model to define the apparent viscosity of the frictional melt suspensions; here, considering the mass movements\u2019 runout speeds of >10\u00a0m s\u22121 (Legros, 2002 and references therein) and the preserved frictional melt thickness of 12\u00a0mm, we estimated the maximum frictional melt strain rate at 103 s\u22121 for use in our calculations (Fig. 12b; Table 1). [Whilst we posit that melt generation and thus melt thickness varied temporally and spatially, we used the preserved frictional melt layer thickness to define strain rate here to illustrate the impact of particles on suspension viscosity.] We observe that the presence of solid particles in the frictional melt significantly increase the range of probable viscosities which impact slip during the debris avalanche. Yet, further constraints of suspension viscosity are difficult without knowledge of temperature conditions in the melt.\nFrictional melting has commonly been described to be a disequilibrium process occurring via selective melting of mineral phases (Spray, 1992, 2010; Shimamoto and Lin, 1994; Lin and Shimamoto, 1998; Wallace et al., 2019). This provides a framework to evaluate frictional melt temperature based on mineral breakdown temperature. Considering that the frictional melting likely involved both wall rocks and that the pyroxenes, some plagioclase and few amphiboles survived implies that most of the amphiboles, any biotite inherited from the ignimbrite, the interstitial glass and some of the plagioclase likely underwent melting. This analysis suggests that the frictional melt may have reached temperatures of approximately 1200\u20131300\u00a0\u00b0C. At such temperatures, the viscosity of the frictional melt preserved in the basal layer would have been 105.1 -104.3\u00a0Pa\u00a0s (for the highest silica melt chemistry) and the apparent viscosity of the suspensions at a strain rate of 103 s\u22121\n\n(\n\n\u03b7\n\na\np\np\n\n\n)\n approximately 105.8\u2013105.1\u00a0Pa\u00a0s (assuming a nominal 0.1\u00a0wt% water dissolved in the melt).\nThe theory of heat conduction detailed by Carslaw and Jaeger (1959) can be used to estimate slip conditions required to generate temperature change (\u0394T):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u0394\nT\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\nV\n\nt\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\nC\np\n\n\n\n\u03c0\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering a friction coefficient (\u03bc) of 0.85 (at static conditions; Byerlee, 1978), a normal stress (\u03c3n) of 2.6\u00a0MPa [based on an overburden of 100\u00a0m and a bulk rock density (\u03c1) of 2656.6\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123 (as determined by He-pycnometry)], a specific heat capacity (C\n\np\n) of 900\u00a0J\u00a0kg\u22121 K\u22121, and a thermal diffusivity (k) of 10\u22126\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121, we can bracket slip velocity (V) and duration (t) along the basal contact. Given that distance (d) is proportional to the products of slip rate and duration, d\u00a0=\u00a0Vt, the above analysis suggests that frictional melting (reaching a nominal temperature of 1250\u00a0\u00b0C), would have occurred in <2\u00a0m if the slip velocity was greater than 5\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121. Fig. 12c shows that for more rapid slip rates, the distance of slip required for melting would have been shorter. This does not agree with the observation that only a thin pseudotachylyte was observed at much greater runout distances of 24\u00a0km. Yet, considering that the basal contact did not generate (or preserve) a pseudotachylyte at a slip distance of 17.5\u00a0km, it suggests that the slip conditions must have locally evolved rapidly during the avalanche, highlighting the transient nature of slip during debris avalanches, including the potential reduction of \u03bc during dynamic slip. Thus, we must turn to other proxies to define local slip rate conditions that led to frictional melting.\nThe early occurrence of frictional melt fragmentation, as witnessed by the presence of pseudotachylyte fragments (with different chemistry to the main pseudotachylyte) in the marginal cataclastic region of the shear zone, demands further appraisal. Silicate melts are viscoelastic bodies which abide by Maxwell's structural relaxation concept (Dingwell and Webb, 1989), where the timescale of relaxation \n(\n\u03c4\n)\n is proportional to the ratio between the melt's shear viscosity \n(\n\u03b7\n)\n and the elastic modulus at infinite frequency (\n\n\nG\n\u221e\n\n\n, approximated at 1010\u00a0Pa for silicate melts at relevant conditions; Webb and Dingwell, 1990):\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u03c4\n=\n\n\u03b7\n\nG\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn rheological analysis, if the timescale of observation \n(\n\nt\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n)\n approaches the relaxation timescale, the material exhibits increasingly elastic behaviour and may rupture if the accumulated stress is sufficient. This can be accessed via the dimensionless Deborah number \n(\nD\ne\n)\n, whereby \n\nD\n\ne\n0\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\nt\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n\n. It has been found that silicate melts tend to rupture at strain rates two orders of magnitude lower than that predicted by viscoelasticity theory; that is, at a critical Deborah limit, \n\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\n0\n\n\n=\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n\n (Webb and Dingwell, 1990). Thus, the critical timescale for rupture has commonly been simplified to \n\n\n\u03c4\nc\n\n=\n\n\u03b7\n\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\n0\n\n\n\nG\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n (Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2015).

However, the presence of the solid fragments and bubbles in the melt layer would have also modified the rheological conditions leading to rupture (e.g. Coats et al., 2018); thus any modelling of frictional melt rheology should account for the complexity borne by suspended particles. Here we detail how to implement this analysis. Cordonnier et al. (2012) suggested that the fraction of crystals in suspension \n(\n\n\u03d5\nx\n\n)\n would lower the critical Deborah number \n(\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\nx\n\n\n)\n following:\n\n(7)\n\n\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\nx\n\n\n=\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\n0\n\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03d5\nx\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\ne\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\ne\n\n\n\n is the maximum packing value estimated for the frictional melt at 0.73 for the early fragmented pseudotachylyte and 0.71 for the later preserved layer. The fraction of bubbles \n(\n\n\u03d5\nb\n\n)\n in the suspension would have similarly lowered the critical Deborah limit of the suspension \n(\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\ns\n\n\n)\n, which according to Coats et al. (2018) would follow:\n\n(8)\n\n\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\ns\n\n\n=\n1.7\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n\n\u03d5\nb\n\n+\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\nx\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich can be rewritten as\n\n(9)\n\n\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\ns\n\n\n=\n1.7\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n\n\u03d5\nb\n\n+\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\n0\n\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03d5\nx\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\ne\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, considering this failure criterion in our previous analysis of maximum strain rate and slip velocity experienced by the frictional melt, we can rewrite Eqs. (5) and (6), by considering \n\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\ns\n\n\n\n instead of \n\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n,\n0\n\n\n\n, obtaining:\n\n(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n=\n\n(\n\n1.7\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n\n\u03d5\nb\n\n+\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03d5\nx\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\ne\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nG\n\u221e\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\n\nAnd\n\n(11)\n\n\n\nV\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n=\n\n(\n\n1.7\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n\n\u03d5\nb\n\n+\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03d5\nx\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\ne\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nG\n\u221e\n\nz\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\n\nrespectively. As the fragmented pseudotachylyte has interstitial melt with a viscosity of 104.4\u00a0Pa\u00a0s and contains \n\n\n\u03d5\nx\n\n=\n\n 0.25 and \n\n\n\u03d5\nb\n\n=\n\n0.14\n\n, we estimate rupture occurred when the strain rate exceeded ~103.4 s\u22121 which would have occurred when the slip velocity exceeded at least 31\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 during debris avalanche (Fig. 12d); this critical slip velocity (for fragmentation) may have been higher for less evolved schlieren present in this early frictional melt. The same calculation for the later formed preserved layer using interstitial melt viscosity \n\n\n(\n\n\u03b7\nl\n\n)\n\n\n of 104.7\u00a0Pa\u00a0s, \n\n\n\u03d5\nx\n\n=\n\n 0.43, \n\n\n\u03d5\nb\n\n=\n\n0.15\n\n and \n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\nl\n\n\n\n=\n0.71\n\n gives a lower maximum velocity of 9.6\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 for the most evolved schlieren within the late frictional melt (but higher values for the less evolved melt filaments). So, these rheological constraints provide a view that the slip velocity varied during the debris avalanche.\nFinally, in order to assess the rheological impact of frictional melt on debris avalanches, we compare the shear resistance \n(\n\n\u03c3\ns\n\n)\n of the modelled melt layers to the shear resistance that would occur in a purely frictional, rock-rock slip environment (i.e., without melt). To do this, we use the viscosity equation:\n\n(12)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\ns\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b7\n\na\np\np\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the strain rate for the layer modelled is calculated by:\n\n(13)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n\n\n=\n\nV\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrictional melt suspension viscosity \n(\n\n\u03b7\n\na\np\np\n\n\n)\n previously calculated (see Table 1) following Costa et al. (2009) constrains the range of shear resistance imposed by the frictional melt onto slip at 4.7\u201356.1\u00a0MPa, evolving to 22.1\u2013260.4\u00a0MPa with further slip (under the same conditions). In contrast, the frictional resistance of rock-rock slip at the base of the deposit may be estimated using Byerlee's frictional law of \n\n\n\u03c3\ns\n\n=\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n (Byerlee, 1978); assuming a friction coefficient of 0.85 and a normal stress, \n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n=\n\u03c1\ng\nD\n=\n2.6\n\n MPa, we estimate the shear resistance during rock-rock sliding at 2.2\u00a0MPa. Comparing the shear resistances offered by rock-rock friction versus frictional melt, we find that the shear resistance calculated for the melt layer at 103 s\u22121 strain rate exceeds that predicted by Byerlee's frictional law. Yet, we surmise that the rate weakening tendency of rock-rock friction (Fialko and Khazan, 2005) would likely promote even lower shear resistances at the slip rates of meters\/seconds described in this section. However, local variations in chemistry, solid fraction and temperature would have promoted strain localisation which may have drastically impacted the resultant shear resistance during slip. It must be noted here, that the modelled apparent viscosities of the frictional melts may have been overestimated as they are constrained at a strain rate (103 s\u22121) exceeding the empirically validated strain rate limit (10\u22121 s\u22121) of the Costa et al. (2009) model. Beyond that limit, the model assumes (hence predicts) that the apparent viscosity no longer decreases as a function of strain rate (i.e., that slip with frictional melt no longer undergoes rate weakening at such extreme rates); thus the shear resistance (calculated for a given viscosity) increases with strain rate, though this remains untested. Further rheological experiments at such extreme rates are required to improve our ability to model the rapid shear regime extant in sector collapse events.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nEmplacement style\nThe palaeotopography of the original land surface included ridges and gullies as evidenced by the preserved palaeotopography and lahar deposits which are restricted to narrow channels in the ignimbrite. Clastic dyking may have resulted from the avalanche crossing fluid rich areas of palaeotopography such as riverbeds, or simply saturated regions of the porous ignimbrite. Local flow directions at Loc. 1 (Fig. 2) indicate that the debris avalanche was at least partially directed by local topography, which may be especially relevant near the thinned margins.\nIn each locality investigated there appears to be very little range in lithic composition. Although little literature exists on the composition of eruptive and intrusive products from Pichu Pichu, the observations made here suggest that the volcanic edifice-forming rocks are consistent with intermediate volcanic products typical of a compound volcano present in the Andes. The homogeneity of the surviving clasts within the flow in the areas studied therefore suggests there was limited internal shear that would have enhanced mixing of different lithologies during the debris avalanche. This is supported by the sharp contact between compositionally different flow packages at Loc. 1 (see Fig. 2e\u2013f). Such separation of flow packages suggests that overall, the flow mostly moved as discrete bodies, though without knowledge of the volcanic units incorporated this interpretation is speculative. Higher up in the flow at Loc. 3 away from high shear at the basal contact, large clasts have been transported intact. In this survey, as the studied shear structures were all in distal localities, it is difficult to convey any constraint about coherence within the core of the flow. Several field mapping studies of collapse deposits have previously noted that mixed-matrix supported facies are rare in deposit cores, but were more common in marginal regions (Glicken, 1998; Belousov et al., 1999). These studies have highlighted that the centre of deposits and proximal areas consist of larger blocks in block-supported facies.\n\n\n6.2\nEvolving degree of strain localisation\nThe basal sliding surface or shear zone of a mass movement is subjected to extreme shear conditions (Erismann and Abele, 2001). As noted at Loc. 1 there is evidence for intense shearing in the lower 2\u20133\u00a0m of the flow, causing the destruction of large clasts, forming a matrix-dominated, well-sorted granular layer. The presence of a matrix-supported basal layer has previously been observed at other avalanche deposits worldwide, such as at Parinacota (Chile) where structureless sedimentary layers occur at the base of each deposit and are interpreted to originate from the localisation of shear during emplacement (Clavero et al., 2002). Similarly, the small grain sizes in the lower 1\u00a0m\u00a0at the base of multiple debris avalanche deposits from Shiveluch (Kamchatka peninsula, Russia), has also been interpreted as the result of shear localisation at the base of a debris flow (Belousov et al., 1999). Although none are associated with a basal pseudotachylyte, it is an indicator of the common occurrence of basal shear localisation and comminution in volcanic debris avalanches. The extreme localisation to produce frictional melting, as seen at Loc. 1 in this study, is still rarely reported. However, earlier studies on this phenomenon at field sites such as Langtang (Nepal: Masch et al., 1985) and Kofels (Austria; Erismann, 1979) have been joined by more recent studies on Markagunt gravity slide in Utah (Hacker et al., 2014), Heart Mountain in Wyoming (Goren et al., 2010), Mont Dore volcanic massif (France; Bernard and van Wyk de Vries, 2017) and a rockslide near Kanchenjunga (Nepal; Weidinger and Korup, 2009) where further landslide generated pseudotachylytes have been identified.\nObservations made in Loc. 2 suggest that basal granular zones may be subjected to a high degree of strain localisation, as observed by an area of pervasive cataclastic shear crosscut by a fault surface, showing slip transfer upon enhanced localisation. Such cross-cutting behaviour, indicative of an increased degree of strain localisation, was further observed in the intra-body shear zones, suggesting that these switches in the degree of strain localisation may not necessarily be restricted to the basal shear zone, but may affect the development of the avalanche as a whole. This may be likely if shear occurs in an unfavourable region as in cases where a contact is uneven with asperities (see Loc. 2) or if local topography slopes against the deposit flow direction or during acceleration or deceleration phases. Rough surface topology across all scales would locally induce higher normal stresses which would respectively promote higher shear stresses (and intergranular forces) in this region of the flow, as illustrated by a sketch diagram in Fig. 13\n. This concentration of stress at the asperities may have promoted the rupture in the granular medium of a new, smoother surface and facilitate flow with lower frictional resistance. This would either act to shift shear to above the asperity (Fig. 13c) and\/or remove some or all of the basal asperity (Fig. 13d), incorporating the fragmented materials in the flow, and promoting shear on a smooth surface as seen at Loc. 2 (Fig. 3e\u2013f). Evidence for both mechanisms are seen, first by the generation of secondary slip surfaces and second by incorporation of ignimbrite material into the flow deposit. The Koefels landslide in Austria underwent a similar process but at a larger scale, forming new internal slip surfaces upon encountering a topographic barrier (in this case a valley wall) (Erismann, 1979). This is somewhat similar to the decoupling process in pyroclastic density currents and block-and-ash flows, where the dilute upper portion of the flow can detach from the lower flow and override a topographic barrier and even travel in a different direction to the lower flow (Fisher, 1995; Douillet et al., 2013). Here, the outcrops at Loc. 1 show 2 distinct zones of shear localisation at different levels within the flow body, similar to the suggestion of De Blasio and Elverh\u00f8i (2008).\n\n\n6.3\nFrictional melting\nAs pseudotachylytes were not ubiquitous along the basal contact, we advance that the generation of frictional melt at the base of debris avalanches may be considered to be both spatially and temporally discontinuous. The occurrence of a fluidised basal layer with enhanced injection and mixing, seen at Loc. 3 and in other landslides (Anders et al., 2010; Craddock et al., 2012) can prevent the strain localisation necessary for frictional melting. Melt formation in volcanic collapses is highly dependent on the conditions (including normal stress from overburden and pore pressure) (Legros, 2002; Nielsen et al., 2008; Violay et al., 2014), extent and rate of shear localisation (Magloughlin and Spray, 1992; De Blasio and Elverh\u00f8i, 2008), heat generation versus diffusion away from slip surface (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959), any residual heat from volcanism, surface topography and roughness (Nielsen et al., 2010), and the melting points and shear strength of the materials (Spray, 1992), many of which would vary and evolve during transport. This may in part explain the common absence of pseudotachylyte at the basal contacts of debris avalanche deposits worldwide, which may also be a result of alteration or destruction (Kirkpatrick and Rowe, 2013). As modelled in section 5.4, debris avalanches flowing at high rates (along one or several thin shear zones) may promote shear rates likely to exceed the structural relaxation of frictional melts to induce brittle failure, preventing preservation.\nThe maximum strain rates that may be accommodated by the thickness of the inhomogeneous melt layer observed indicates that the flow exceeded ~31\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 to fragment it. However, the higher modelled viscosity of the preserved layer suggests that it would have fragmented at slip velocities exceeding 9.6\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 (at the estimated temperatures). As the layer has remained intact, this suggests that the flow slowed between the fragmentation of the early melt-bearing layer and the formation of the preserved melt-bearing layer. This may also imply that the shear was localised elsewhere, a hypothesis supported by the occurrence of a secondary slip surface above the basal contact at this locality, or the layer preserved in the outcrop was a late stage feature formed as the flow slowed. Thus, slip velocity may dynamically vary during transport, as a function of distance, palaeotopography and strain partitioning onto different fault surfaces; such contrasting slip conditions may promote compressional and extensional regimes in the flow, which could induce secondary shear zones and intrusion of clastic dykes.\nAlthough frictional melts are commonly regarded as potential lubricating layers promoting increased runout distances (Erismann, 1979; De Blasio and Elverh\u00f8i, 2008), the rheological comparison of the apparent viscosity to Byerlee (1978) friction indicates that frictional melting is unlikely to have lessened the basal shear resistance at the high shear rates expected; even though the early frictional melt (prior to fragmentation) exhibited a relatively low apparent viscosity. Additionally, variation in melt layer thickness, temperature, and the incorporation of both exsolved and dissolved water from the breakdown of amphiboles could have rheologically impacted the development of frictional melts and promoted lubrication through time. If the formation of pseudotachylyte is a cyclic process in which melting may be followed by fragmentation (if strain rate is too high) and slip re-localisation onto a new fault plane, then the lubricating or viscous braking effects of frictional melts may equally be cyclic. It must be noted that variability in chemistry and, importantly, crystallinity during selective melting and melt homogenisation controls the rheological evolution of frictional melt (Spray, 2010; Wallace et al., 2019) and whether lubrication or viscous brake locally develops with slip.\n\n\n\n7\nConcluding remarks\nThe Arequipa volcanic landslide deposit originated from the sector collapse of Pichu Pichu volcano and forms an area of elevated hummocky topography approximately 300\u00a0m thick at its maxima, which extends 26\u00a0km west from the dissected volcanic complex in a broad, fan-like shape that covers ~200\u00a0km2. The andesitic debris avalanche, which likely exceeded 20\u00a0km3 in volume, ramped up over a palaeotopography of ignimbrite during runout.\nThe subsequent deposition of eruption products of other proximal volcanoes and the incision of rivers into the deposit obscures the original topography. However, river valleys reveal the basal contact and structures within the lower portion of the flow. Field examination, chemical analyses and microstructural observations highlight the complex nature of shear during the debris avalanche. We observed evidence of a variety of shear deformation mechanisms (cataclasis and frictional melting), degrees of strain localisation, and strain partitioning across the body of the flow (summarised in Fig. 14\n).\nThe basal contacts show varying degrees of shear localisation. The first example evidences a high level of shear with near total fragmentation of clasts near the basal contact and extreme localisation of shear to form a thin layer of pseudotachylyte. Fragments of pseudotachylyte within the cataclasite at the base suggests multiple generations of melt. Geochemical results combined with rheology modelling are used to suggest that the fragmentation of melt layers could be attributed to high strain rates that forced the melt into brittle rupture, thus limiting the chance of a persisting melt layer. Contrastingly, the second locality studied has a more diffuse basal shear zone, less fragmentation of clasts, multiple fracture sets and crosscutting slip surfaces that show slip zone evolution and indicate more distributed shear.\nWithin the lower portion of the debris avalanche body, at several localities, secondary shear zones are observed in the deposit. This highlights the propensity to delocalise shear from the basal plane to be accommodated on other discrete planes. Additionally, we note the presence of clastic dyking which likely originates from the basal plane and suggests the presence of a pressurised, fluidised layer in some areas that may have been enhanced by crossing of river beds or water saturation of the underlying porous ignimbrite. The interaction of clastic dykes, shear planes and the juxtaposition of distinct flow units suggests that active shearing planes acted as barrier layers limiting material mixing and causing segregation of the flow.\nWe conclude that shear localisation can occur at both the basal contact and on discrete planes within the flow and that frictional melting at the debris flow base may be possible at areas of extreme localisation of shear. However, it is unlikely that frictional melt aided lubrication at the base or that it persisted throughout the debris avalanche deposition, instead local deformation mechanisms at the flow base likely switched rapidly. The localisation of shear can therefore change both through time and spatially across the flow due to topographic, lithological and environmental changes of the land surface.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAmy Hughes: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing, Visualization, Project administration, Funding acquisition.

(1991, 1993), Unruh et al. (1996), Twiss and Unruh (1998), Figueiredo et al. (2004), Twiss and Unruh (2007), Twiss (2009), \u017dalohar and Vrabec (2010) and \u017dalohar (2012, 2014, 2015, 2018). These studies focused on explaining the properties of fault-slip patterns on faults in symmetrical (Andersonian and non-Andersonian) and asymmetrical stress fields in the Earth's crust, and showed that rotations of blocks between fault planes have a considerable effect on the slip direction along the faults. This elucidated the very mechanical behaviour of the fault zones. Therefore, the Cosserat theory enabled the development of a refined theory of tectonic faulting and earthquakes (\u017dalohar, 2018), which also coincides with the physics of seismicity migration, solitons, strain (or tectonic) waves, and vortex geology developed since 1980 (e.g., Malamud and Nikolaevskiy, 1983, 1985; 1989; Nikolaevskiy and Ramazanov, 1985; Nikolaevskiy, 1995, 1998; 2006; Mikhailov and Nikolaevskiy, 2000; Bykov, 2005; Vikulin et al., 2012, 2013; 2016; Levina and Ruzhich, 2015; Bykov and Trofimenko, 2016).\n\nNikolaevskiy (1995, 1998) suggested that a possible way to find out the local geophysical field dynamics for tectonic stresses is to use the sine-Gordon equation. The sine-Gordon equation is derived because the restoring moment of momentum is proportional to the vector multiplication of the reactive force and the corresponding arm. Based on this approach, Gershenzon et al. (2009) and Bykov and Trofimenko (2016) used the sine-Gordon equation to model tectonic plate movements and faulting process. Based on geodetic observations at GPS sites in proximity to local active faults in Amurian plate, Bykov and Trofimenko (2016) showed that the seasonal variations of the GPS station positions have a clear relation to the breather solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. A breather is a spatially localized, time periodic, oscillatory solution of the sine-Gordon equation. It represents the stress and strain fields, which periodically oscillate in time and decay exponentially with increasing distance from the center.\nIn this paper we describe two additional observations of the breather-type oscillating stresses in the Earth's crust. The first was observed in the South America from 2017 to 2019, while the second was observed south of Japan from 1977 to 1979. The first example is an almost ideal breather, and is, therefore, described first. The second example contains some natural noise, but can still be modelled as a breather. Our approach is based on the calculation of the normalized tectonic shear stress using the modified moment tensor summation method. The normalized tectonic shear stresses and their time-development are calculated from the earthquakes focal mechanisms. We use the Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog (https:\/\/www.globalcmt.org). We further discuss the relevance of our results for future studies of tectonic stresses in the Earth's crust and in earthquake studies.\n\n\n2\nMaterial and methods\n\n2.1\nSine-gordon equation and breathers\nDue to the fragmented state of the rocks in the Earth's crust and the possibility that blocks can rotate, Nikolaevskiy (1998, 2006), Mikhailov and Nikolaevskiy (2000) and Garagash and Nikolaevskiy (2009) assumed that the fractured rocks of the Earth's crust are subject to the Cosserat mechanics. In the Cosserat continuum the deformation of the volume element is described by two independent vector fields: the rotational vector field \n\n\n\u03c6\n\u2192\n\n\n, and the displacement vector field \n\n\nu\n\u2192\n\n\n. Nikolaevskiy (1995, 1998) modelled the local wave mechanics for tectonic stresses by using the sine-Gordon equation for geophysical field dynamics. The sine-Gordon equation is derived because the restoring moment of momentum is proportional to the vector multiplication of a reactive force and the corresponding arm. The parameterization of the sine-Gordon equation for geophysical material such as the Earth's crust depends strongly on the model under consideration. Therefore, we will present here some general mathematical properties of its solutions. The sine-Gordon equation reads (Ivancevic and Ivancevic, 2013):\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\u2202\n\nt\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n\n\n\n=\n\u2212\nsin\n\u03c6\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \nt\n is time, and \nx\n is spatial coordinate. In the Earth's crust, \n\u03c6\n can represent the rotations of the blocks, which occur between the sets of subparallel faults or along intersecting faults or wedges (\u017dalohar, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2018) This shows that the sine-Gordon equation is a nonlinear extension of the standard linear wave equation \n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n\/\n\n\u2202\n\nt\n2\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n\/\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n\n\n\n\n (Ivancevic and Ivancevic, 2013). The solutions of the sine-Gordon equation for the Earth's crust are slow solitary waves (solitons), which are often referred to in the literature as deformation waves, tectonic waves or strain waves (see \u017dalohar, 2018, for a detailed review of the literature). The sine-Gordon equation has many solutions. The best known are kink, anti-kink and breathers. For this article, only breathers are important.\n\nBykov and Trofimenko (2016) used the following \u201cstandard\u201d breather solution:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03c6\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\n=\n4\n\u00a0arctan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03c9\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\nsin\n\u03c9\nt\n\n\ncosh\n(\nx\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03c9\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \n\u03c9\n is the angular frequency of a breather, which is spatially localized, time periodic, oscillatory solution of the sine-Gordon equation. It represents a field which is periodically oscillating in time and decays exponentially in space as the distance from the center \n\nx\n=\n0\n\n increases.

The seismic moment is defined as \n\n\nM\nS\n\n=\nG\nM\n\n, where \nM\n is the geometric moment. Note that the moment tensor is asymmetric because of the rotation inherent to simple shear deformation resulting from the fault slip (Marrett and Allmendinger, 1990), and it also does not account for any volume changes.\nIn our model, Equation (3) is improved in the following way:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n=\n\n1\nT\n\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\nw\nk\n\n\nm\nk\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nr\nk\n\n\n\/\n\n\nL\nC\n\n\n\n)\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \n\n\nw\nk\n\n\n is the weight, with the values either \n\n\nw\nk\n\n=\n\nM\nS\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n\n (weighted model) or \n\n\nw\nk\n\n=\n1\n\n (unweighted model). In addition, \n\n\nr\nk\n\n\n is the distance to the epicenter of the k-th fault\/earthquake, and \n\n\nL\nC\n\n\n is the Cosserat characteristic length. In the Cosserat continuum we introduce the dimensionless distance \n\n\n\n\nr\nk\n\n\n\/\n\n\nL\nC\n\n\n\n\n, which defines the rotation of the material in different observation scales (e.g., \u017dalohar, 2018). Such an approach is unknown and unusual in the classical Cauchy continuum and is strictly borrowed from the Cosserat continuum. Note that the classical Cauchy continuum has no characteristic length. The exact mathematical description of rotations in the Cosserat continuum far exceeds the scope of this paper, and is available in \u017dalohar (2018). Note that in Equation (4) the same characteristic length \n\n\nL\nC\n\n\n is used for all earthquakes, independent of their seismic moment or magnitude. This means that Equation (4) describes the average strain rate associated with rotations at the scale defined by the selected value of \n\n\nL\nC\n\n\n, and neglects all local \n\n(\nL\n\u226a\n\nL\nC\n\n)\n\n or global \n\n(\nL\n\u226b\n\nL\nC\n\n)\n\n variations of the strain rate field. This is an obvious simplification used in our model, which, however, still gives useful results. The power factor \nn\n in the above equation reflects the far-field effects (\n\nn\n=\n1\n\n), the intermediate-field effects (\n\nn\n=\n2\n\n), or the near-field effects (\n\nn\n=\n3\n\n). This is similar as in the elastic theory of point sources in seismology and elastomechanics (e.g., Udias, 1999).\nAccording to \u017dalohar (2018), the tectonic stress tensor can be calculated from the symmetric part of the strain rate tensor \n\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n; \n\u03c3\n=\n\np\nr\n\n1\n+\n2\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\nS\n\n\n.\n The problem is, however, that the values of the parameters \n\n\np\nr\n\n\n and \n\n2\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n\n are unknown. Therefore, the only possibility is to calculate the normalized reduced stress tensor\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n\n in the following way:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n\nn\no\nr\n.\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\nS\n\n\n6\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n(\n6\n)\n\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n11\n\n,\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n22\n\n,\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n33\n\n,\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n12\n\n,\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n23\n\n,\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n13\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nis the six-dimensional vector in the Fry\u2019s (1999, 2001) \u201cstress space\u201d that corresponds to the symmetric part of the strain rate tensor \n\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n, and\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n(\n6\n)\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n11\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n22\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n33\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n12\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n23\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nu\n\u02d9\n\n\n13\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis the norm of this vector.

In the following, we will only focus on the near-field effects by using \n\nn\n=\n3\n\n in Equation (4). In this study, we use the Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog, which contains information on time, location, seismic moment, magnitude, moment tensor, and nodal planes for each earthquake. The following stress measures are then calculated everywhere on Earth within some arbitrary resolution.\nThe normalized shear stress\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n is calculated as the shear stress produced by the normalized reduced stress tensor \n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n\n on a fault plane with the unit normal vector \n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\n:\n\n(8)\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nn\no\nr\n.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u2016\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\u22c5\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\n\u2016\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nCharts of the normalized shear stress are then produced by calculating the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n on all nodal planes contained in the seismic catalog (i.e. in the CMT catalog). Based on the theory of focal mechanisms (e.g., Udias, 1999), one of the nodal planes belonging to each earthquake is assumed to be the true fault plane. In some tectonic zone at the locality \n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n we may have several earthquakes with different values of the normalized shear stress \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n. Therefore, the following numerical method is used to construct the actual field of \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n at some locality \n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n. The normalized shear stress field \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n at a specific point \n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n is defined as the maximum value of the \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n values on any nodal plane within the circular region with the radius \n\n\nL\nS\n\n\n around that point:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n)\n\n=\nmax\n\n{\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n;\n\u00a0\n\nr\nk\n\n\u2264\n\nL\nS\n\n\n}\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \n\n\nr\nk\n\n\n is the distance between the point of interest \n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\n\n and the epicentre of an earthquake associated with the k-th nodal plane.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nUsing the modified moment tensor summation method described above, we analyzed the time-dependant changes of the global tectonic shear stress fields worldwide since the beginning of the CMT catalog in 1976. Since the global seismicity data were used originating from different depths and lithologies, our calculations only represent a rough approximation of the real stress field. We used the unweighted model for the near-field effects, \n\nn\n=\n3\n\n in Equation (4). In most cases, the time changes of the shear stresses are relatively non-systematic and chaotic. In many cases, however, the clearly systematic changes occur which indicate either (1) a slow increase of the shear stresses followed by a slow decrease or (2) a slow decrease of the shear stresses followed by a slow increase. Two such cases are described below as case studies. In both cases we analyzed the oscillations of the normalized shear stress in the Points of Interest (PI), which were interpreted as the central points of the observed breathers. This means that \n\nx\n=\n0\n\n in Equation (2), and \n\ncosh\n\n(\nx\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03c9\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\n1\n\n. Equation (2) can then be simplified into the following possible forms for the normalized shear stress:\n\n(10)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n0\n\n\u00b1\n4\narctan\n\n(\n\na\n\u00a0sin\n\n(\n\u03c9\nT\n)\n\n)\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nor\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n(\nn\no\nr\n.\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n0\n\n\u00b1\n4\narctan\n\n(\n\na\n\u00a0cos\n\n(\n\u03c9\nT\n)\n\n)\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choice of which function to use in the model depends on the phase of the breather, which will be illustrated further in the continuation of the paper. Here, \n\n\n\u03c4\n0\n\n\n represents the average value of the normalized shear stress, \n\n4\na\n\n is then an amplitude in the central Point of Interest (PI), \n\n\u03c9\n=\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\/\n\n\nT\n0\n\n\n\n\n is the frequency, \n\n\nT\n0\n\n\n is the period, and \nT\n is time.\n\n3.1\nSouth America case study; 2017\u20132019\nAfter a several months long time interval of high normalized shear stress along west coast of South America, the systematic decrease of the shear stress started around September 7, 2017, followed by a systematic increase which ended around August 23, 2019 (Figs. 1 and 2\n\n). We analyzed in detail the value of the normalized shear stress in the Point of Interest (PI) at latitude \u221221\u00b0 and longitude 70\u00b0. This point is interpreted as the center of the observed breather, where the oscillations of the normalized shear stress field are the largest.\n\nFig. 1 shows three stages in the evolution of the normalized shear stress in the region in three time intervals, and an illustrative comparison with theoretical breather; January 1, 2017\u2013December 28, 2017 (A), February 1, 2018\u2013January 28, 2019 (B), July 1, 2018\u2013June 28, 2019 (C). At the beginning of the cycle (Fig. 1A), the area around PI was characterized by high normalized shear stress around 0.96. In the middle of the cycle (1B), the normalized shear stress around PI decreased toward the values around 0.85. At the end of the cycle (Fig. 1C) the normalized shear stress returned again toward high values around 0.96. The northern and southern regions of South America experienced smaller variations of the normalized shear stress (Fig. 1). The highest variations of the shear stress were detected around PI.\n\nFig. 2 illustrates the exact time-development of the normalized shear stress in PI and comparison to the theoretically ideal breather.

The estimated period was 716 days\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015 days, which is approximately 2 years. The studied breather was only stable for one period. The breather then disintegrated and the oscillations of the normalized shear stress in the region become irregular and chaotic.\n\n\n3.2\nJapan case study; 1977\u20131979\nThe second case study was observed in the regions of Ryuku Islands, Kumano Ridge, Zenisu Ridge, Kalsuura Basin, Izu-Ogasawara Trench, and Mariana Trench. After a several months long time interval of low normalized shear stress in this region, the systematic increase of shear stress started around March 25, 1977, followed by a systematic decrease which ended around March 11, 1979 (Figs. 3 and 4\n\n). We analyzed in detail the value of the normalized shear stress in the Point of Interest (PI) at latitude 31\u00b0 and longitude 140\u00b0, which is interpreted as a center of the observed breather.\n\nFig. 3 shows three stages in the evolution of the normalized shear stress in the region in three time intervals and an illustrative comparison with theoretical breather; July 1, 1976\u2013June 28, 1977 (A), March 1, 1977\u2013February 28, 1978 (B), May 1, 1978\u2013April 28, 1979 (C). At the beginning of the cycle (Fig. 3A), the area around our PI was characterized by low normalized shear stress around 0.74. In the middle of the cycle (3B), the normalized shear stress around PI increased toward the values around 0.95. At the end of the cycle (Fig. 3C) the normalized shear stress returned again toward low values around 0.77. The highest variations of the shear stress were detected around our PI (Fig. 3) in the northern part of the analyzed region.\n\nFig. 4 illustrates the exact time-development of the normalized shear stress in PI and comparison to the theoretically ideal breather.

The estimated period was 717 days\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015 days, which is approximately 2 years. The studied breather was only stable for one period. Then the breather disintegrated and the oscillations of the normalized shear stress in the region become irregular and chaotic.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe fast and instantaneous elastic response of the rocks in the Earth's crust can be successfully modelled within the framework of the classical Cauchy continuum, leading to the ordinary wave equation (Udias, 1999). The solutions of this wave equation are the primary and the secondary seismic waves. However, slow faulting and fracturing related elastoplastic or elastoviscoplastic deformations of the Earth's crust and rotations of blocks between the fault planes can be better modelled within the framework of the Cosserat continuum. This leads to modifications and improvements of the wave equations, such as those represented by the sine-Gordon equation. The solutions of the sine-Gordon equations are slow solitary waves (solitons), which are often referred to in the literature as deformation waves, tectonic waves or strain waves (see \u017dalohar, 2018, for a detailed review of the literature). The sine-Gordon equation has many solutions, but the general logic is that the solitary waves derived from it are not subject to the \u201cordinary\u201d linear superposition principle (Ivancevic and Ivancevic, 2013). The B\u00e4cklund transformations provide a way to obtain the hierarchy of the sine-Gordon solutions, when a new solution can be build on the basis of known solutions (Ivancevic and Ivancevic, 2013; Dodd et al., 1982). This leads to one-soliton solutions, such as kink and anti-kink solutions, and two-solitons solutions, such as kink-kink collision, kink-antikink collisions, and breathers. In fact, many breather solutions exist as well (Ivancevic and Ivancevic, 2013; Dodd et al., 1982), for example, standing breather, large amplitude breather, moving breather and small amplitude breather. Examples of the three-solitons solutions include, for example, standing kink and moving breather collisions, standing kink and moving small amplitude breather collisions, standing breather and moving kink collisions. The question is whether such waves can be found in the Earth's crust, and this needs to be addressed in the future research.\nThe only evidence for the possible existence of breathers in the Earth's crust was provided by Bykov and Trofimenko (2016). Based on geodetic observations at GPS sites in proximity to local active faults in Amurian plate, these researchers showed that the seasonal variations of the GPS station positions show a clear relationship to the breather solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. Our research on the global tectonic stresses partially presented also in this paper offers many new opportunities to study this question. In this paper we showed that oscillations of the global tectonic shear stress can also be successfully modelled as breathers. We presented two cases studies, the first in the region of South America, and the second in the region of Japan. The two case studies represented two breathers with the opposite phases. In South America, the systematic decrease of shear stress started at the beginning of the cycle, followed by a systematic increase towards the end of the cycle. In contrast, in the region of Japan, systematic increase of shear stress started at the beginning of the cycle, followed by a systematic decrease towards the end of the cycle. The two breathers had two additional common features; (1) both were stable for only one period of time, and (2) their period was almost exactly the same, about 2 years. This represents an interesting question for our further studies. Furthermore, it will be very important to study the relationship between the breathers and large earthquakes, tremors, slow-slip events, and volcanic eruptions.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJure \u017dalohar: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Writing - original draft.

While oceanic detachments form at (ultra)slow spreading ridges (Fig. 1d), continental detachments are found in convergent as well as divergent tectonic settings (Platt et al., 2015; Whitney et al., 2013). Syn-convergent continental detachments (Fig. 1a, e g. South Tibetan Detachment) can form through (episodic) gravitational collapse (Burchfiel and Royden, 1985; Rey et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2012) or channel flow and ductile extrusion (Beaumont et al., 2001; Grujic et al., 1996; Searle, 2010; Teyssier et al., 2005; Vannay and Grasemann, 2001). Classical low-angle detachments in the North American Cordillera, on the other hand, result from large-magnitude extension and bound domes\/antiforms of metamorphic rocks known as metamorphic core complexes (MCCs; Fig. 1b) (Armstrong, 1982; Coney, 1980). Similar structures are found around the globe, particularly in areas that experienced orogenic collapse such as the Aegean (Jolivet and Brun, 2010), Variscides (Vanderhaeghe et al., 2020) or Caledonides (Fossen, 2010). Furthermore, recent models of passive margins increasingly invoke a crucial role of detachments and supradetachment basins in their distal parts (Fig. 1c; Brun et al., 2018; Clerc et al., 2018; Jolivet et al., 2018; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018).\nAlthough detachments are fundamental tectonic features, their formation is far from fully understood (Axen, 2007). Driving forces, low-angle fault mechanics, localization mechanisms and structural models are often controversial (Labrousse et al., 2016; Lavier et al., 1999; Platt et al., 2015; Searle and Lamont, 2020). Detachments in distinct lithospheres, settings and areas clearly have different characteristics (John and Cheadle, 2013), still their formation shows two common denominators: I) Detachments are inevitably associated with the exhumation of previously ductile material (Fig. 1), sometimes including (partially) molten rocks (Whitney et al., 2013); II) Detachment faults are weakened by growth of weak phases such as phyllosilicates (Collettini et al., 2009b; Grasemann and Tschegg, 2012; Holdsworth, 2004). Therefore, the retrogressive structural and rheological evolution of the ductile crust is a key to better understand the formation of detachment zones. However, even in exposed continental detachment systems, inadequate erosion levels or steep topographic relief (Fig. 1) often limit access to systematically study their ductile parts.\nTo address this issue, we studied the deeply eroded footwall of a major continental detachment system in W Norway that formed during collapse of the Caledonian orogen (Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Fossen, 2010; McClay et al., 1986; Norton, 1987; Osmundsen et al., 2005). Located in the core of the Bergen Arcs megastructure (Fig. 2\n), the \u00d8ygarden Complex (\u00d8C) represents a domiform MCC with a flat erosion surface at sea level (Fig. 3\n) that cuts through ~10\u00a0km of crustal section. The so-called \u2018strandflat\u2019 morphology (Holtedahl, 1998) results in >1200\u00a0km of coastlines within an area of 75\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0km, furthermore complemented by road sections along and across structural trends. This situation provides ideal conditions for systematic structural mapping at multiple scales. In this contribution, we present the first comprehensive study of ductile(-to-brittle) structures in the \u00d8C including semi-quantitative mapping of ductile strain with the DISK scheme (Wiest et al., 2019) and a systematic analysis of 23 shear zones. Based on our results, we discuss the boundary conditions and dynamics of MCC formation and the structural evolution of the exhuming ductile crust. We compare the \u00d8C to MCCs in other orogens, neighboring domes, and geodynamic models, to infer implications for the formation of large-magnitude continental detachments.\n\n1.1\nDetachments vs. d\u00e9collements\nAlthough the term detachment is sometimes also used to include reverse faults or thrust zones with marked structural and\/or metamorphic breaks (e.g. Milnes et al., 1997), we here follow Whitney et al. (2013) and restrict the term to large-magnitude, low-angle, extensional high-strain zones that comprise ductile shear zones as well as brittle faults. As pointed out by Brun et al. (2018), the terms detachment and d\u00e9collement are not synonymous. Detachments are kilometer-scale fault zones, which cut across lithological contacts and unit boundaries (incision and excision as defined by Lister and Davis, 1989). In contrast, d\u00e9collements are weak layer-parallel horizons localizing deformation, which can occur from the microscale (see examples below) to the scale of entire orogens (Fossen, 1992).\n\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe \u00d8ygarden Complex (\u00d8C) is a dome-shaped window (Fig. 3) that exposes Baltic Shield basement in the core of the Bergen Arcs (Kolderup and Kolderup, 1940). The latter is an enigmatic megascale structure that formed through the combined effects of Caledonian orogenesis and post-orogenic collapse (Fossen and Dunlap, 1998).\n\n2.1\nBaltic Shield\nThe Baltic Shield in W Norway originally formed between 1.6 and 1.5\u00a0Ga through arc magmatism and sedimentation (Bingen and Solli, 2009; Roberts and Slagstad, 2015; Roberts et al., 2013). The crustal configuration of this part of the Baltic Shield mainly formed during the 1.2\u20130.9\u00a0Ga Sveconorwegian orogeny (Bingen et al., 2005). Alternating episodes of extension and contraction characterized by a hot orogenic setting (Bingen et al., 2008) involved extensive magmatism and widespread migmatization (Coint et al., 2015; Slagstad et al., 2013, 2018b). During the Ediacaran, a segmented passive margin was established and continental ribbons rifted off the margin while the Iapetus ocean was opened (Andersen et al., 2012; Jakob et al., 2019; Kj\u00f8ll et al., 2019). The Baltic Shield was transgressed and Cambrian shales were deposited onto deeply eroded Sveconorwegian crust (Gee et al., 2008).\n\n\n2.2\nCaledonian orogeny and extensional collapse\nThe Silurian to Early Devonian Caledonian orogeny comprises the closure of the Iapetus ocean until collision of Baltica (lower plate) with Laurentia (upper plate) from around 430\u00a0Ma (Corfu et al., 2014; Slagstad and Kirkland, 2018). Nappe stacking of different units of the Iapetus ocean, the Laurentian margin and the previously formed continental ribbons formed a thick orogenic wedge that was thrusted onto the Baltican margin while the Cambrian shales acted as a basal d\u00e9collement (Fossen et al., 2017; Gee et al., 2008). At this stage, the Baltican margin must have been very strong so that it could get coherently subducted (Butler et al., 2015) reaching high-to ultrahigh-pressure conditions recorded in eclogites (ages ~425\u2013400\u00a0Ma, see compilation by Kylander-Clark and Hacker (2014)) and felsic gneisses in the Western Gneiss Region\/Complex (Cuthbert et al., 2000; Dobrzhinetskaya et al., 1995; Griffin and Brueckner, 1980; Root et al., 2005; Wain, 1997).\nWhile there is evidence for syn-convergent detachments in the overriding plate on the Laurentian (Greenland) side of the orogen (Andresen et al., 2007; Hartz et al., 2001; Hodges, 2016), the Scandinavian lower plate shows overwhelming evidence for post-orogenic collapse (Fossen, 1992, 2010). Following continent collision from around 405\u00a0Ma, reversed plate movements (Fossen et al., 2017; Rey et al., 1997) led to extensional reactivation of the basal d\u00e9collement (Fossen, 2000) and the resulting eduction of the continental slab caused near-isothermal decompression of the deeply buried Baltican crust (Andersen et al., 1991; Butler et al., 2013; Duretz et al., 2012; Root et al., 2005). Crystallization ages of migmatites between 405 and 390\u00a0Ma witness the thermal softening and increased buoyancy of the orogenic root at this stage (Ganzhorn et al., 2014; Gordon et al., 2013; Kylander-Clark and Hacker, 2014; Labrousse et al., 2002). This led to wholesale collapse of the overthickened crust in a regime of sinistral transtension, forming orogen-scale extensional detachments and sinistral strike-slip zones while Devonian supradetachment basins were deposited (Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Chauvet and Seranne, 1994; Fossen, 2010; Fossen et al., 2013; Hossack, 1984; Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Osmundsen et al., 2006; S\u00e9guret et al., 1989; Seranne, 1992; Seranne and Seguret, 1987). Ages of amphibolite-to greenschist-facies reworking during exhumation and cooling mostly fall between 405 and 375\u00a0Ma (Chauvet and Dallmeyer, 1992; Fossen and Dallmeyer, 1998; Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Kylander-Clark et al., 2008; Spencer et al., 2013; Walsh et al., 2013).\nPost-orogenic deformation shows a regional strain gradient from cold crust in the foreland and the upper parts of the orogenic wedge to hot crust in the orogenic infrastructure (Fauconnier et al., 2014; Fossen et al., 2014; Hacker et al., 2010; Milnes et al., 1997). The Hardangerfjord shear zone (Fig. 2) is an extensional shear zone that cross-cuts the basal d\u00e9collement and corresponds to the limit of thick-skinned post-orogenic deformation involving the Baltic Shield basement (Fossen and Hurich, 2005). Along the west coast of southern Norway, the Nordfjord-Sogn detachment zone exhumed strongly deformed eclogite-bearing crust in MCCs that were juxtaposed with Devonian supradetachment basins (Braathen et al., 2004; Hacker et al., 2003b; Johnston et al., 2007a; Norton, 1987; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Wiest et al., 2019). Deep crustal flow was largely coaxial (Andersen et al., 1994; Hacker et al., 2010) and involved large-scale internal necking as well as extension-parallel upright folding due to constriction (Fig. 2: cross section B\u2013B'\u2019; Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998; Labrousse et al., 2002; Labrousse et al., 2004). In proximity to the detachment zones, coaxial flow was overprinted by retrograde simple-shear deformation that involved vertical shortening (Andersen et al., 1994; Johnston et al., 2007b; Wiest et al., 2019). Detachment shearing started at amphibolite-facies conditions and evolved progressively into brittle conditions (Braathen et al., 2004). From the Permian through the Mesozoic, two phases of North Sea rifting brittlely overprinted and partly reactivated Caledonian structures (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.3\nThe Bergen Arcs\nThe Bergen Arc system (Fig. 3) consists of a heterogeneous stack of thrust nappes that were imbricated during Caledonian convergence (Kolderup and Kolderup, 1940; Kvale, 1960). The Minor Bergen Arc comprises elements of the Iapetus ocean (Fossen, 1989), while the Bl\u00e5manen Nappe represents a fragment of Baltican basement and its sedimentary cover (Fossen, 1988). The Lind\u00e5s Nappe is famous for early Caledonian fluid-induced eclogitization of granulite-facies anorthosites and experienced partial melting leading to syn-convergent exhumation (Austrheim, 1987; Bingen et al., 2004; Jolivet et al., 2005; Kuhn et al., 2002; Labrousse et al., 2010). The Gullfjellet Ophiolite and the Sunnhordland Batholith belong to a suite of arc-related rocks that formed in a supra-subduction setting, possibly at the Laurentian margin (Andersen and Jansen, 1987; Furnes et al., 2012; Pedersen et al., 1992). The Major Bergen Arc includes parts of the pre-Caledonian hyperextended margin (Andersen et al., 2012; Jakob et al., 2017). Together, these different units are folded into an arcuate synformal structure, which occupies the hanging wall of the extensional Bergen Arcs shear zone (Wennberg, 1996; Wennberg et al., 1998). The \u00d8C forms the core of this structure and the contact between the \u00d8C and the nappe stack is a basal thrust that has been reactivated as an antithetic detachment (Wiest et al., 2018b). Small remnants of Devonian supradetachment basins are preserved on islands directly north of the \u00d8C (upper left corner of Fig. 3).\n\n\n2.4\nThe \u00d8ygarden Complex (\u00d8C)\nThe \u00d8C consists of Telemarkian (1.5\u00a0Ga) granitic crust and Proterozoic metasediments that were migmatized and intruded by voluminous plutons during the ~1.0\u00a0Ga Sveconorwegian orogeny (Slagstad et al., 2018a; Sturt et al., 1975; Wiest, 2020; Wiest et al., 2018b; unpublished SIMS U\u2013Pb zircon ages of granitic leucosomes). These 1050\u20131000\u00a0Ma Sveconorwegian magmatic rocks can be directly correlated with equivalent rocks in southern Norway, which are undeformed (Coint et al., 2015) and suggest an autochthonous position of the \u00d8C and a Caledonian age of deformation (Wiest et al., 2018b). While large granitic and gabbroic plutons dominate the eastern and southern part of the complex (Askvik, 1971; Bering, 1985; Fossen and Ragnhildstveit, 2008; Weiss, 1977; Wiest et al., 2018b), the central and northern part comprise mostly migmatites, leucogranites and locally quartzite-schist assemblages that apparently resisted migmatization (Austrheim and Ragnhildstveit, 1999; Johns et al., 2001). Many of the granites in the entire \u00d8C are exceptionally radioactive and associated with high heat production values (Pascal and Rudlang, 2016; Rudlang, 2011; Schulze, 2014). On the 1:250.000 geological map (Ragnhildstveit and Helliksen, 1997), mafic rocks cover 14% of the exposed surface of the \u00d8C, but smaller scale mafic bodies are abundant.\nDuring the Caledonian orogenic cycle, the \u00d8C experienced intense ductile reworking (Fossen and Rykkelid, 1990; Rykkelid and Fossen, 1992) including partial melting of the lowest levels (Johns, 1981). SIMS U\u2013Pb zircon ages date crystallization of granitic leucosomes at 405\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma and overlap with Ar\u2013Ar white mica and biotite ages in between 405 and 399\u00a0Ma (Wiest, 2020). These new ages confirm that most of the observed deformation occurred during post-orogenic collapse and led to rapid exhumation of ductile crust as suggested by previous models (Boundy et al., 1996; Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Fossen and Rykkelid, 1992; Wiest et al., 2018b). This is furthermore constrained by the onset of brittle faulting dated at ca. 396 Ma (Larsen et al., 2003). During North Sea rifting, the \u00d8C formed a horst (Fossen, 1998) and limited number of coast-parallel alkaline dikes intruded in the Permian and Triassic (Fossen and Dunlap, 1999). Steep brittle faults, which cut through the gneissic fabrics, formed in multiple episodes from the Carboniferous until the Cretaceous (Fossen et al., 2016; Ksienzyk et al., 2014, 2016).\n\n\n\n3\nStructural architecture of the \u00d8C\nThe \u00d8C forms a shallow dome structure with only the eastern half exposed. The western part is below sea level and structural trends can be traced in the bathymetric data (Fig. 3). A series of cross-sections and a pseudo-3D view (Fig. 4\n) show the internal architecture of the complex. Extension-parallel E-W sections show consistently E-dipping fabrics that obtain a gentle westward dip at the westernmost exposures and in offshore seismic sections (Fossen, 1998; Gr\u00fcnwald, 1994). The ca. 25\u00a0km-long, continuously exposed central E-W section (F\u2013F\u2032) represents ca. 10\u00a0km of vertical crustal section from the top of the complex in the east to the deepest exposed levels in the west. Extension-perpendicular N\u2013S sections show a very different picture. At upper levels (section B\u2013B\u2032), the gneissic fabric forms an open antiform with second-order undulations. At lower levels (section A-A\u2019), the gneissic fabrics define five subdomes. Except for the Fedje dome (Larsen, 1996) in the north, the subdomes are exposed as E-plunging antiforms (Larsen et al., 2003). At the lowest level in the core of the complex, migmatites define a double-dome structure.\nWe distinguished three structural units within the \u00d8C that are characterized in the following section 3.1. They share important similarities such as retrogressive simple shearing, similar orientations of fabrics of different metamorphic grades (section 3.2) and a similar style of stretching and folding (3.3). Section 4 provides a more detailed characterization of shear-zone evolution in each of the units.\n\n3.1\nStructural units (levels)\n\n3.1.1\nUpper Unit\nLocalized amphibolite-facies deformation characterizes the Upper Unit (Fig. 5\n). Pervasive shearing was weak and dominated by L\u00a0>\u00a0S fabrics (Fig. 6\n) so that primary textures within large Precambrian granite and gabbro plutons were preserved (Wiest et al., 2018b). Augen gneisses with feldspar augen in a fine-grained multi-phase matrix represent the most common rock type. Banded gneisses and mylonites are only found in high-strain zones. Retrograde deformation at greenschist facies to semi-brittle conditions was abundant in the Upper Unit. On the map scale, there are large tracts of phyllonites and fault rocks that range from mixed mylonites\/cataclasites to amorphous ultracataclasites. On the microscale, low-temperature\/high-stress fabrics commonly overprint coarse-grained high-grade fabrics. Quartz-rich rocks show regime 3 fabrics as defined by Hirth and Tullis (1992), cut by micro-scale shear zones and mylonitic quartz veins with regime 1\u20132 fabrics (electronic supplement 2). While symmetric fabrics are sometimes found in homogeneous gneisses and amphibolites, most fabrics are asymmetric, especially where phyllosilicate-rich layers are present, and indicate almost exclusively top-to-E kinematics (Fig. 6).\n\n\n3.1.2\nMiddle Unit\nPervasive amphibolite-facies shearing characterizes the Middle Unit (Fig. 5). It consists largely of banded gneisses and amphibolites, while Precambrian protoliths and localized deformation are only found in low-strain domains (Fig. 6). Isolated lenses of micaschist contain kyanite, sillimanite and garnet. The characteristic rock type of the unit are banded gneisses with L\u00a0=\u00a0S fabrics (Fig. 6) formed by a medium-grained phase mix of quartz, feldspar and biotite. Fine-grained feldspar layers show no competence contrast to quartz-rich layers with regime 3 microfabrics. Feldspar-rich pegmatites, on the other hand, represent weakly deformed rigid bodies within gneisses and amphibolites. Progressive strain-localization occurred during retrograde deformation from kilometer-scale gneissic zones into meter-scale high-strain zones. These weak zones are inherited micaschists or formed by retrograde, fluid-induced phyllonitization (see documentation in section 4.3 and electronic supplement 2). In either case they show highly localized semi-brittle deformation. On the microscale, regime 1\u20132 quartz microstructures are restricted to micro-scale shear zones, while the gneissic fabric shows abundant sericitization and saussuritization. Similar to the Upper Unit, coaxial deformation is recognized in homogeneous gneisses and amphibolites (Fig. 6), but more common are asymmetric fabrics indicating top-to-W kinematics. Simple shearing comprises distributed as well as localized deformation at different metamorphic grades, ranging from banded gneisses to semi-brittle chlorite phyllonites (see section 4.3). The mapped boundary between Upper and Middle Unit (localized vs. distributed deformation) coincides with the respective occurrence of top-to-E and top-to-W fabrics.\n\n\n3.1.3\nLower Unit\nThe Lower Unit (Fig. 5) consists of Caledonian migmatites with melt crystallization dated by SIMS U\u2013Pb zircon geochronology to 405\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma (Wiest et al., 2018a). These migmatites are metatexites with varying amounts of melt and form a double-dome structure with steep E-W striking foliations in the core of the complex (Fig. 4). However, heterogeneous solid-state deformation overprinted the original geometry of the migmatite bodies. A weak pervasive stretching lineation developed in biotite-melanosomes, while localized shear transformed the migmatites into banded gneisses. A suite of garnet-staurolite-kyanite amphibolites within the migmatites show a progressive development from melt-present deformation to ductile-brittle greenschist facies deformation (see section 4.4). Other shear zones in the migmatite domain show a cataclastic overprint.\n\n\n\n3.2\nFabric orientations\nWe compiled a large structural dataset, which comprises newly acquired data from this study, digitized measurements from structural maps (Bering, 1985; Bernhard, 1994; Gr\u00fcnwald, 1994; Johns, 1981; Larsen, 1996; Wiest et al., 2018b; Ytredal, 1995, 1996) as well as the digital structural database of maps from the Norwegian geological survey (Andersen et al., 1988; Austrheim and Ragnhildstveit, 1999; Bering et al., 1988; Fossen and Ragnhildstveit, 2008; Johns et al., 2001). In total, our dataset comprises 4024 foliations, 1072 lineations and 115 fold axes and is made available in electronic supplement 1.\nFabrics throughout the complex show a consistent pattern of shallowly ESE-plunging stretching lineations, lineation-parallel fold axes and a corresponding girdle of mostly flat-lying foliations (Fig. 7\n). Structural trends are similar in the three units and amphibolite- and greenschist-facies fabrics are parallel. The migmatitic Lower Unit, however, shows steeper migmatitic foliations cut by solid-state fabrics (electronic supplement 2). We distinguish six structural subareas to highlight second-order geographical variations in fabric orientations. The Laksev\u00e5g area (Upper Unit) shows a dominant ENE fabric trend that rotates towards ESE in the northern part of the Ask\u00f8y area (Upper and Middle Unit) and in the southern Sotra area (Upper and Middle Unit). The \u00d8ygarden area (Middle Unit) shows consistently flat-lying foliations and an ESE-trend within a large scatter of linear fabrics. NE-plunging fold axes are found in weakly deformed rigid bodies. West-dipping fabrics occur in the westernmost part of this area. Linear fabrics in the Fedje area (Middle Unit) have a clear ESE-WNW trend, while foliations define a dome. Both linear and planar fabrics are here steeper than in most of the Middle and Upper Units. The migmatite core (Lower Unit) has steep migmatitic foliations that have been vertically shortened by solid-state shearing. The trend of fabrics in this area is close to E-W and foliations show a S-vergence with a steeper southern limb and a shallow northern limb. This asymmetry is reflected in the geometry of the entire complex (Fig. 3).\n\n\n3.3\nFolding and boudinage\nGneissic tectonites in the \u00d8C are strongly anisotropic and display very different structural characteristics in lineation-parallel (E-W) and -perpendicular (N\u2013S) sections (Fig. 8\n). Different fold structures are observed on different scales. While E-W-trending upright folds are seen on the map-scale (Figs. 4 and 8a), tight to isoclinal recumbent folds are abundant on the outcrop-to micro-scale. Literal textbook examples of multilayer buckle folds (Fig. 8b; see Fossen, 2016) show that competent layers (amphibolites or feldspar-rich pegmatites) controlled fold geometries during vertical shortening. Fold hinges are commonly occupied by retrograded amphibolites (biotite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chlorite phyllonites) in between more competent granitic layers (Fig. 8c). The weak phyllosilicate-rich layers allowed the formation of tight to isoclinal folds and show a genetic relationship between recumbent folds and retrogressive shear at amphibolite to greenschist facies conditions (see section 4).\nIn contrast to N\u2013S sections, E-W sections show a remarkably parallel stratification of the undulating gneissic foliations (Fig. 8d). On the outcrop-scale, the lineation-parallel sections reveal abundant necking instabilities formed by layer-parallel extension. Purely ductile necking structures are symmetric, but more commonly we find asymmetric boudinage of amphibolites and feldspar-rich pegmatites associated with shear fractures (Fig. 8e). In heterogeneous gneisses, asymmetric foliation boudinage (Fig. 8f) and small-scale folding instabilities (Fig. 8g) formed above phyllosilicate-rich small-scale d\u00e9collements (Rykkelid and Fossen, 1992). The map-scale structural relationships suggest that E-W stretching lead to necking and extension-perpendicular horizontal shortening forming upright folds. Under retrograde metamorphic conditions, shearing involved vertical shortening and was becoming progressively more non-coaxial.\n\n\n\n4\nShear-zone evolution at different structural levels\nTo characterize the structural and metamorphic evolution of different levels of the MCC in more detail, we present a description of 23 high-strain zones (Fig. 9\n) in form of a catalogue (electronic supplement 2) that contains field photos, illustrations and microphotographs. We summarize our observations in Table 1\n and classify shear zones with respect to their geometry, lithologies, localization and rheology. In the following, we describe representative shear zones of the different structural levels before we summarize aspects of shear zone evolution during MCC exhumation.\n\n4.1\nBounding shear zones\/faults\n\n4.1.1\nAustevoll shear zone\nThe southern bounding shear\/fault zone of the \u00d8C is exposed on the island Austevoll, where it merges with the higher-level Sunnhordland detachment (Andersen and Andresen, 1994). The Austevoll locality (Fig. 10\n) is separated from the \u00d8C by the 700\u00a0m-deep Krossfjord. An E-W trending ductile-to-brittle fault zone juxtaposes strongly sheared gneisses with weakly deformed granites of the Sunnhordland batholith (Andersen and Jansen, 1987), which occupied high structural levels of the orogenic wedge (Scheiber et al., 2016). The footwall of the fault consists of a 300\u00a0m-wide section of S-dipping mylonitic to ultramylonitic banded gneisses (Fig. 10b) that have characteristics of the Middle Unit with top-to-W and dextral kinematics. Shear fractures host quartz veins and phyllonitic layers show new growth of white mica and chlorite, suggesting the presence of fluids during mylonitization. A zone of granitic and mafic ultramylonites was incised by a steep E-W trending brittle fault zone. In a 10-20\u00a0m-wide damage zone the rocks are strongly fractured and shattered, while there is a very discrete fault plane that juxtaposes the embrittled gneisses with fractured granite. Away from the fault, the granite in the hanging wall (Fig. 10c) is weakly deformed except for local shear zones. A large amount of incision and excision must have taken place in the fault zone, to juxtapose gneisses from the Middle Unit of the \u00d8C with the upper levels of the Caledonian nappe stack. This fault is cut by coast-parallel faults and fractures that carry Permian dikes (Fossen and Dunlap, 1999), suggesting that it originated prior to North Sea rift initiation. Also, the deep fjord in between the Austevoll locality and the \u00d8C (Fig. 3), invokes the presence of weak rocks (e.g. phyllonites) in a wide shear zone in the footwall of the exposed fault.\n\n\n\n4.2\nUpper Unit\n\n4.2.1\nLoddefjord shear zone\nThe 300\u00a0m-thick, shallowly E-dipping shear zone (Fig. 11\na\u2013c) is located structurally ca. 1\u00a0km below the eastern boundary of the complex (Wiest et al., 2018b). Anastomosing zones of banded gneisses and mylonitic amphibolites show top-to-E fabrics and contain low-strain lenses of weakly deformed protoliths (Fig. 11a). They show that the Loddefjord shear zone formed in the heterogeneous contact zone between large gabbro and leucogranite bodies (Fig. 11b). Heterogeneous deformation of mafic layers led to boudinage and fracturing of rigid (coarse grained) layers. Abundant veins and hydration of the amphibolites demonstrate fluid ingress along these fractures. Within the alteration zones, biotite replaced amphibole and, if more water was present, biotite was almost entirely replaced by chlorite. Chlorite-phyllonites form layers that are up to 10\u00a0m thick and 100s of meters wide. Within these phyllonitic shear zones, the original rheological relationships were reversed. The mafic phyllonites represented the weakest layers and contain fractured and sheared clasts of granitic rocks (Fig. 11c). Small angular granitic clasts were rotated and rounded in the ductile phyllonite matrix (Wiest et al., 2018b, their Fig. 6B), which gave the peculiar-looking fault rock the nickname \u2018tectonic conglomerate\u2019 (Kolderup and Kolderup, 1940). Anastomosing subhorizontal fractures represent the last stage of deformation in the phyllonite shear zones.\n\n\n4.2.2\nKlokkarvik shear zone\nThis shallowly E-dipping shear zone is up to 800\u00a0m-thick and represents the boundary between the Upper and Middle Unit along the eastern coast of Sotra. The Klokkarvik shear zone localized in a highly heterogeneous zone of amphibolites, granitic gneisses and pegmatites (Fig. 11d) that separates relatively weakly deformed homogeneous bodies of granite and gabbro above and below the shear zone, respectively. Fabrics within the shear zone show consistently top-to-ESE kinematics, while top-to-W fabrics are found in the gneisses below (Fig. 6). Lithological heterogeneity and variable deformation of coarse- and fine-grained amphibolites caused large competence contrasts within the shear zone that resulted in ductile-brittle deformation. Boudinage-related fracturing of rigid coarse-grained mafic rocks (Fig. 11d) created pathways for fluids that formed hydrothermal mineralizations of quartz, feldspar and pyrite. Within granitic layers, coarse-grained feldspar-rich pegmatites represent rigid layers and quartz-filled fractures formed at their borders. The quartz veins were themselves mylonitized, while hydration at the contacts formed muscovite (\u00b1chlorite) phyllonites (Fig. 11d). These felsic phyllonites show phase-mixing microstructures and the development of micro-shear bands through the connection of muscovite layers (electronic supplement 2).\n\n\n\n4.3\nMiddle Unit\nThe pervasive deformation in the Middle Unit makes the definitions of shear zones somewhat arbitrary. Yet, some zones show even higher strains than their surroundings and fall into three categories: 1. Strain localization next to weakly deformed bodies, 2. Localization in inherited weak rheologies, 3. Progressive strain-localization during retrograde deformation.\n\n4.3.1\nSkogs\u00f8y shear zone\nLocated in the westernmost part of the \u00d8C, where fabrics turn into westward dip, a ca. 50 m-thick subhorizontal shear zone developed at the contact between a leucogranite and Precambrian migmatite (Fig. 12\na). The homogeneous leucogranite consists almost entirely of coarse-grained K-feldspar and quartz and contains dismembered mafic boudins. On top of the shear zone, the leucogranite forms a NW-verging fold with NE-plunging fold axes and mineral stretching lineations. Towards the shear zone, grain size decreases continuously, and the mafic bodies become more and more stretched out. The core of the shear zone is a 10\u00a0m-thick zone of ultramylonite with shallowly NW-plunging stretching lineations, clear top-to-NW kinematic indicators and sheath folds. The granitic ultramylonite contains rare K-feldspar augen but shows mostly a uniform fine-grained microstructure with evenly distributed feldspar, quartz and finely dispersed biotite. Thin biotite-layers act as small-scale decollements (Fig. 8h).\n\n\n4.3.2\nBlom shear zone\nThe 200\u00a0m-thick shallowly NE-dipping shear zone shows consistent top-to-W kinematics. It represents a heterogeneous zone of mylonitic gneiss, amphibolite, quartzite and sulfidic garnet-micaschist (Fig. 12b). The protolith relationships suggest that the quartzite\/schist lenses are resisters, which escaped Precambrian migmatization, and represent inherited weak layers that localized Caledonian shearing. In the largest, ca. 5\u201310\u00a0m thick schist layer folded and mylonitized quartz veins are abundant. These brittle-ductile fabrics are cut by a foliation-parallel, dm-thick subhorizontal fault gouge (Fig. 12b), which in turn is cut by steep brittle faults and fractures of Early Devonian age (Larsen et al., 2003).\n\n\n4.3.3\nToft\u00f8y shear zone\nThe Toft\u00f8y shear zone (Fig. 12c) represents a wide zone of strongly deformed gneisses that locally contain weakly deformed Precambrian migmatites. Foliations dip shallowly to the east and are folded along lineation-parallel ESE-plunging recumbent folds (Fig. 8c). Kinematic indicators show consistently top-to-W kinematics. Abundant biotite-d\u00e9collements controlled the evolution of shear zone structures in the gneisses (Fossen and Rykkelid, 1990, 1992; Rykkelid and Fossen, 1992). These biotite layers formed either as melanosomes of Precambrian stromatic metatexites (cm-thick, several m2 lateral extent) or as retrogressed amphibolite layers (m-thick, several km2 lateral extent). The metatexites are more strongly deformed than neighboring quartzitic gneisses. Vertical shortening through recumbent folding allowed the formation of laterally extensive, subhorizontal high-strain zones that show progressive strain-localization during retrograde deformation and hydration of mafic layers. The best exposures of these processes are found in the Toft\u00f8y-Vik locality, which is part of a 3\u00a0km-long, shallowly E-dipping ductile-to-brittle fault zone (Fig. 12c\u2013e). Amphibolite-facies gneisses show boudinage of mafic layers, while some large amphibolite layers are transformed into chlorite-biotite phyllonite (Fig. 12d) and form a \u2018tectonic conglomerate\u2019 with fractured granitic clasts in a sheared phyllonite matrix (Fig. 12d and e). Compared to the phyllonite zones in the Upper Unit, however, these phyllonites are coarser grained and show top-to-W kinematics.\n\n\n\n4.4\nLower Unit\n\n4.4.1\nSpjeld shear zone\nThe steeply N-dipping Spjeld shear zone represents the northern boundary of the migmatite domain. The migmatites in this zone contain a tract of highly reactive garnet-staurolite amphibolites with three distinct fabric domains that record a progressive evolution from high to low grade (Fig. 13\n). Domain 1 consists of meter-scale lenses of unfoliated amphibolite, which contains no macroscopically visible plagioclase. The rock consists of large, unoriented amphiboles and garnet and skeletal staurolite crystals reaching up to 10\u00a0cm in diameter. Rutile inclusions occur commonly in garnet and Johns (1981) describes occurrences of kyanite. The rock contains veins consisting entirely of garnet and plagioclase-garnet-staurolite leucosomes at the boundary to Domain 2. The latter consists of coarse-grained amphibolites that contain abundant plagioclase and have a well-developed vertical foliation that wraps around the Domain 1 lenses. Plagioclase shows textures indicative of partial melting and occurs commonly around garnet that is replaced by magnetite. Solid-state symmetric fabrics show coaxial stretching in E-W direction, but asymmetric foliation boudinage indicates a sinistral sense of shear. Domain 3 is a coarse-grained chlorite phyllonite shear zone cutting obliquely through the Domain 2 fabric. The shear zone developed along a vertical fracture with thick plagioclase-quartz veins that served as a pathway for fluids, which hydrated the rock so that all mafic phases were replaced by chlorite.\n\n\n\n4.5\nShear zones and structures across the scales\nSome of the described structures and processes are self-similar on different scales, while others are not (Fig. 14\n). Necking occurs from the microscale, affecting minerals, to the crustal-scale forming an entire MCC. Folds are recumbent on the mesoscale, but upright on the macro- and megascale. Coherent migmatite bodies are observed up to the km-scale, however, the extent of migmatites at deeper levels of the complex could be larger. The mapped migmatites coincide precisely with an E-W-elongated positive magnetic anomaly (Gellein, 2007a). Similar anomalies in other parts of the complex might indicate unexposed migmatite bodies that could be connected at depth as indicated in Fig. 4.\nBased on Table 1 we can assess micro-to mesoscale aspects of shear zone localization and rheology. Shear zones localized either in inherited weak zones, at the rim of weakly deformed rigid bodies or at unit boundaries and always represent zones of strong lithological heterogeneity. Phyllosilicates, either inherited or newly formed, played an important role in many shear zones. Phyllosilicate layers were inherited in form of melanosomes in stromatic metatexites or schist layers that escaped migmatization. Lithological heterogeneity and variable shearing of coarse-grained (rigid) and fine-grained layers lead to brittle-ductile deformation. Fluid ingress along shear fractures was associated with retrograde hydration, especially of mafic rocks. Biotite-phyllonites formed from retrogressed amphibolites are very common, but usually no more than a few decimeters thick. Individual bodies of chlorite (\u00b1biotite)-phyllonites, which formed through advanced hydration of mafic layers, can be up to 10\u00a0m thick, but shear zones commonly contain multiple levels of phyllonites. Muscovite-quartz phyllonites formed through hydration of felspar-rich granitic rocks but are less common.\nWhen trying to extrapolate our outcrop-scale observations, it becomes clear that the inherited as well as newly formed weak d\u00e9collements could have controlled the rheology of the ductile crust, as soon as they formed an interconnected shear zone network. The map-scale pattern of shear zones suggests this as a plausible scenario in the case of the \u00d8C. Inside these shear zones, however, a multitude of factors and processes determined the rheology, which furthermore evolved over time. During retrogression, ductile-to-brittle deformation became progressively localized into weak phyllosilicate horizons until the last increment represented by subhorizontal, foliation-parallel fault gouges that are cut by Early Devonian steep faults (Larsen et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThe \u00d8ygarden Complex \u2013 A bivergent MCC\nWe have shown that the \u00d8C is a ductile dome that contains structures formed at different crustal levels. Retrogressive E-W stretching with increasing strain intensity from top to bottom formed ductile-to-brittle shear zones at all exposed structural levels. This deformation includes simple shear, vertical shortening and low-grade retrogression, which is characteristic for the footwall of continental detachment systems (Whitney et al., 2013). Available dates from the \u00d8C show an evolution from partial melt crystallization (U\u2013Pb zircon leucosomes: ~405\u00a0Ma) to rapid exhumation of ductile crust (Ar\u2013Ar white mica and biotite: mostly 405\u2013399\u00a0Ma) (Boundy et al., 1996; Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Wiest, 2020) reaching brittle conditions around ca. 396 Ma (Fossen et al., 2016; Larsen et al., 2003). These ages correspond to post-orogenic collapse in a regime of sinistral transtension (Fossen, 2000; Fossen et al., 2013; Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001). Today, the \u00d8C is in contact with remnants of Devonian supradetachment basins (north), uppermost parts of the orogenic wedge (south) and various nappes of the Bergen Arc system (Fig. 3). As discussed by Wiest et al. (2018b), the eastern contact of the \u00d8C can be considered as an E-directed detachment that reactivated the original basal thrust (Fossen, 1989) with variable amounts of excision. Besides, parallel reflectors in near-shore seismic data suggest a shallowly W-dipping detachment offshore (Fossen et al., 2016). This is also indicated by the westward rotation of fabrics into westerly dip associated with dominant top-to-W kinematics, top-to-W shear zones at the southern and northern tips of the complex, and overlaying Devonian supradetachment basins. Although not exposed, the location of this western detachment can be inferred from a pronounced E-W-trending magnetic anomaly (Gellein, 2007a) that corresponds precisely to the mapped migmatite domain. All of the aforementioned points suggest that the \u00d8C represents a bivergent MCC, exhumed during post-orogenic collapse.\n\n\n5.2\nBoundary conditions of post-orogenic MCC formation\nA post-orogenic MCC model agrees with the boundary conditions of the Bergen Arc system. Although ductile flow might have occurred during convergence (see section 5.3), we found no structures in the \u00d8C that can be clearly assigned to this stage. In the overlaying nappes of the Bergen Arcs system, in contrast, ages and structures related to syn-convergent deformation and exhumation are abundant (Fossen, 1988, 1989; Fossen and Dunlap, 1998, 2006; Jolivet et al., 2005; Kuhn et al., 2002). This conforms with the notion, that the Baltican margin was cool and rigid during continental subduction so that deformation became localized into the overlaying basal d\u00e9collement and weak allochthons (Butler et al., 2015; Fauconnier et al., 2014; Fossen, 1992). Post-orogenic extension, on the other hand, affected an overthickened and thermally softened, but rheologically highly heterogeneous crust. The orogenic wedge was relatively cold and consisted of various thrust nappes with very distinct histories and rheologies (Fossen et al., 2017). The Bergen Arcs system is mostly occupied by dry lower-crustal rocks of the Lind\u00e5s Nappe (Austrheim, 2013) and the Gullfjellet Ophiolite, which represented both rigid and dense bodies (Gellein, 2007b). Structurally underneath, the km-thick thrust-related mylonites and schists of the Minor and Major Bergen Arcs (Faerseth et al., 2011; Fossen, 1989) constituted d\u00e9collements localizing deformation. The three map units within the \u00d8C and their structural characteristics can be interpreted as rheological layers with downward decreasing viscosity. The boundary between the Upper and Middle Unit represents the transition from localized to distributed strain (Cooper et al., 2017), while the limit of partial melting defines the Lower Unit. Highly radioactive granites (Pascal and Rudlang, 2016) may have caused a thermal anomaly in the \u00d8C. Previously, late Caledonian partial melting has been reported only from the highest-grade regions of the Western Gneiss Region (Gordon et al., 2013, 2016; Hacker et al., 2010; Kylander-Clark and Hacker, 2014; Labrousse et al., 2004, 2011). The rheological layering, inferred for the Bergen Arcs system and the underlying \u00d8C (Fig. 15\n) at the onset of post-orogenic extension, represents a first-order parameter controlling intra-crustal necking and MCC formation (Huet et al., 2011; Labrousse et al., 2016; Wijns et al., 2005).\n\n\n5.3\nFormation of the \u00d8ygarden dome and the Bergen Arcs\nThe formation of domes is commonly controversial (Yin, 2004) and the \u00d8C is no exception. The juxtaposition of the migmatite domain with strongly deformed, but solid-state structural levels suggests that the \u00d8ygarden dome formed within the ductile (plastic) crust. This could have happened during convergence or initial post-orogenic extension. The peculiar relation of opposing shear senses at upper and lower levels of the \u00d8C inevitably invokes comparison with models of channel flow (Grujic, 2006) or \u2018compressional MCCs\u2019 (Searle and Lamont, 2020). Doming and top-to-W fabrics above the migmatite domain could be related to horizontal eastward flow of a partially molten layer during ongoing convergence (\u2018channel detachment\u2019 by Teyssier et al., 2005). Such a model, however, does not explain the systematic retrogressive overprinting of fabrics with consistent, but opposing kinematics in different domains. Alternatively, the opposing shear senses might represent westward extrusion of a ductile nappe similar to the Greater Himalayan Series (Grujic et al., 1996). However, this model is not supported by the regional structural context (Fossen, 2000; Fossen et al., 2014) and available geochronological data (Wiest, 2020). A more consistent explanation may be provided by transtensional doming during post-orogenic collapse involving westward ductile extrusion of high-grade, low-viscosity material at lower levels.\nIn the latter scenario (Fig. 15), initial stretching of the rheologically layered orogenic crust caused upper crustal faulting, while necking instabilities developed in the ductile crust. The inverted rheological and density structure with the Lind\u00e5s Nappe and Gullfjellet Ophiolite on top of partially molten granitic basement induced doming of the \u00d8C. Inside the basement, necking of upper levels was compensated by extension-perpendicular shortening within the lower levels, forming mega-scale upright folds including the migmatite double-dome (Le Pourhiet et al., 2012; Rey et al., 2017; Wiest et al., 2019). During continued crustal stretching, these structures were progressively overprinted by bivergent detachments. As a result, the dense nappes sank into an arcuate synformal structure, caught in between the concave Bergen Arcs Shear Zone (Wennberg et al., 1998) and the convex eastern detachment wrapping around the \u00d8ygarden dome (Fig. 15). Considering the deep erosion level, the structural relationship of the \u00d8C and Bergen Arcs can thus be seen as ductile equivalents to horsts and grabens.\n\n\n5.4\nShear zone evolution during MCC exhumation\nIndifferent of these models, we can discuss factors that controlled the rheology within the exhuming shear zones. The observed amount of leucosomes in the Lower Unit of the \u00d8C (Fig. 15a) suggests that the presence of melt initially controlled deep crustal flow (Rosenberg and Handy, 2005), while high temperatures activated pervasive ductile flow in the Middle Unit. In the Upper Unit, preexisting lithological heterogeneity (Fig. 15b) appears as the main parameter that controlled shear zone localization (Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2007) and became progressively more important for the lower levels. Competence contrasts related to variable mineralogy and grain size led to ductile-brittle deformation and channelized fluid flow in shear fractures (Fig. 15c). The \u00d8C shows evidence of abundant syn-tectonic fluids of probable metamorphic and\/or magmatic origin (Quilichini et al., 2016; Siebenaller et al., 2012; Whitney et al., 2013). There must have been significant permeability in the ductile crust, to allow the large fluid fluxes that are needed to form the observed chlorite phyllonites (Fig. 15d). Chlorite contains on average 5 times as much water as amphiboles and 3 times as much as mica (Hacker et al., 2003a). If we consider for example an ellipsoid-shaped amphibolite body with dimensions 100\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0m x 10\u00a0m (corresponding to one of the larger phyllonite bodies observed in the Loddefjord shear zone) that consisted of 50% amphibole, an influx of roughly 2 million liters of water would be needed to convert all the amphibole to chlorite. Fluids could have moved through shear zones by intergranular processes, such as creep cavitation (Fusseis et al., 2009), yet, on the mesoscale we observe ductile-brittle fracturing (Fig. 15c) as the major mechanism providing transient permeability. The relative abundance of pervasively phyllonitized amphibolites compared to granitic rocks implies a higher reactive potential for fluid-rock interaction in mafic rocks (Kleine et al., 2015). Furthermore, the fabric weakening associated with fluid-induced retrogressive phyllosilicate growth (Bos and Spiers, 2002) activated a feedback loop of shearing, channelized fluid flow and phyllonitization. This made mafic rocks sinks for fluids and turned them into the weakest layers, in stark contrast to their expected behavior at low metamorphic grades. During exhumation and retrogression, deformation progressively localized into phyllosilicate-rich d\u00e9collements, either inherited (melanosomes and schists) or newly formed (phyllonites), eventually forming subhorizontal brittle faults (Fig. 15e). If we assume that these d\u00e9collements were interconnected in a self-similar manner across the scales (Fig. 14), the rheology of phyllosilicates (Aslin et al., 2019; Bos and Spiers, 2002; Hunter et al., 2016; Wintsch et al., 1995) controlled the deformation of the exhuming ductile crust at some stage.\n\n\n5.5\nComparison with other MCCs\nConsidering the rheological profile of the crust, the \u00d8C appears to represent an intermediate case in between classical \u201cCordilleran metamorphic core complexes\u201d without migmatization (e.g. Armstrong, 1982; Coney, 1980; Platt et al., 2015) and migmatite-cored MCCs hosting gneiss domes with extensive melting such as the Cordilleran Shuswap MCC (Norlander et al., 2002; Teyssier et al., 2005; Vanderhaeghe et al., 1999, 2003), the Aegean Naxos MCC (Cao et al., 2013; Jolivet et al., 2004; Vanderhaeghe et al., 2004) or the Variscan Montaigne Noire dome (Brun and Van den Driessche, 1994; Roger et al., 2015; Whitney et al., 2015). Besides the geological setting of orogenic collapse, the \u00d8C resembles these MCCs also in other aspects. Despite the difference in erosion level, the similarity between Caledonian and Cordilleran MCCs has long been noted (McClay et al., 1986). The \u00d8C shows similar Precambrian basement rocks in the core, opposed shear senses (Cooper et al., 2010) and a downward succession from localized to distributed (solid-state) deformation (Cooper et al., 2017). The inferred structure of the migmatite double-dome, on the other hand, resembles the Montagne Noire and Naxos MCCs (Kruckenberg et al., 2011; Rey et al., 2017; Roger et al., 2015). The exotic garnet-staurolite amphibolites described in Section 4.4 might indicate that the \u00d8C migmatites sampled portions of the lower crust and transported them upwards in a manner similar to the model proposed by Whitney et al. (2015) for the Montagne Noir eclogites. Rutile inclusions in garnets suggest that these amphibolites experienced pressures above 10\u00a0kbar (Zack and Kooijman, 2017), assuming that the rutile is metamorphic, which is 2\u00a0kbar higher than the only previously published thermobarometric estimate from the \u00d8C (Boundy et al., 1996). Low-grade retrogression involving fluid alteration, has affected all structural levels of the Naxos MCC (Cao et al., 2017). The retrogressive shear zone evolution described in this study can be better understood by comparing the \u00d8C to nearby MCCs in W Norway.\nCoaxial stretching and deep crustal necking, followed by detachment-related simple shearing, is characteristic for most of the Western Gneiss Region and the extensional system of SW Norway (Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Andersen et al., 1994; Fossen, 2010; Hacker et al., 2010; Labrousse et al., 2002, 2004; Wiest et al., 2019). Although an order of magnitude smaller, the \u00d8C structurally resembles the Central Norway basement window (Braathen et al., 2000). More directly, it can be compared with the neighboring Gulen MCC (Fig. 2). While syn-extensional melting was absent at the exposed level of the Gulen dome (Wiest et al., 2019), deep crustal extension-perpendicular inward flow of solid-state low-viscosity material formed a high-grade core with abundant eclogites, coaxial strain, subvertical foliations and isoclinal upright folds parallel to subhorizontal lineations. Wrapping around the core, detachment mylonites are distinguished by retrograde simple shear deformation, vertical shortening and low-grade retrograde deformation involving fluid-rock interaction. Why was a high-grade core preserved in the Gulen MCC, while the entire \u00d8C shows characteristics of detachment shearing? The Gulen MCC apparently experienced higher pressures during continental subduction, although retrogression may just have obliterated any traces of eclogite-facies metamorphism in the \u00d8C (note the description of rutile inclusions in garnet in section 4.4). On the other hand, the crust in the \u00d8C had either a higher geothermal gradient because of especially heat-producing granites (Pascal and Rudlang, 2016) or experienced higher strain rates, so that migmatites were exhumed from a deeper crustal level (Rey et al., 2009). Most importantly, however, fluids seem to have been more abundant in the \u00d8C and triggered a weakening feedback in the exhuming ductile crust. The exact source of these fluids is yet unknown, but we note the location of the \u00d8C above a postulated extinct Sveconorwegian mantle wedge, which might have been hotter and more hydrous than average lithospheric mantle (Slagstad et al., 2018a). Lastly, the \u00d8C is the only MCC exposed in the hanging wall of the main detachment system that runs along the west coast of southern Norway (Fig. 2). An important implication of this point is the possible existence of multiple levels of (bivergent) detachments and MCCs in the North Sea region, which could have influenced rifting (Fazlikhani et al., 2017).\n\n\n5.6\nComparison with models and implication for detachments\nBased on numerical and analogue models (e.g. Brun et al., 1994; Tirel et al., 2008; Tirel et al., 2006), Brun et al. (2018) suggest that detachments must not necessarily initiate at the onset of extension, but can evolve progressively during exhumation of ductile crust. This model-based idea conforms very well with our observations from the \u00d8C. We see a km-wide \u2018processing zone\u2019 in the ductile crust where retrogressive shearing forms an interconnected network of inherited and newly formed phyllosilicate-rich d\u00e9collements (Fig. 16\n). The \u00d8C might represent an extreme end-member case, caused by the excessive abundance of fluids. Still, similar processes could be essential for detachments in general, given their consistent ductile-to-brittle evolution and the important role of phyllosilicates within such structures (Bos and Spiers, 2002; Collettini et al., 2009a; Hunter et al., 2016; Whitney et al., 2013; Wintsch et al., 1995).\nThis idea could help to resolve an apparent paradox in the formation of extensional continental detachments. A high intra-crustal strength contrast is needed for internal necking of the crust (Labrousse et al., 2016), as opposed to wide rifting or whole-crust necking compensated by mantle flow (Brun et al., 2018; Buck, 1991). On the other hand, the thickness (and hence the strength) of the brittle layer limits localization on a single detachment fault (Lavier and Buck, 2002; Lavier et al., 1999). So, while a strong brittle layer is mandatory for intra-crustal necking, it impedes the formation of MCCs. Based on our model of the \u00d8C, we speculate that retrogressive shearing triggers positive weakening feedbacks, which reduce the viscous strength of the exhuming ductile crust. This effectively reduces also the thickness of the brittle layer, allowing brittle deformation to localize into single faults that eventually become detachments.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nWe explain the structure of the \u00d8C and the Bergen Arcs by bivergent MCC exhumation during post-orogenic collapse. Extension of a rheologically layered orogenic crust led to necking and doming controlled by viscous flow of the (partially molten) Baltic Shield basement. Lithological heterogeneity during shearing triggered a feedback loop of ductile-brittle deformation, channelized fluid flow and retrogressive phyllosilicate growth, which caused fabric weakening particularly in mafic layers. The interconnection of inherited and newly-formed, phyllosilicate-rich d\u00e9collements controlled the progressive localization of deformation. The associated weakening of the exhuming ductile crust promoted the formation of bivergent detachments that juxtaposed the \u00d8ygarden dome with Devonian supradetachment basins and high levels of the former orogenic wedge. Our results suggest that retrogressive weakening can occur in a kilometer-wide ductile-to-brittle \u2018processing zone\u2019 and represents an essential mechanism for the progressive formation of continental detachments.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJ.D.

Fault-bend folds and fault-propagation folds are ramp folds because they are related to thrusts in a ramp situation (Fig. 1\n), whereas detachment folds are related to thrusts in a flat situation (Fig. 2\n). Fault-bend folds (Rich, 1934) develop as rocks move along non-planar thrust surfaces resulting in rock bending. Fault-propagation folds (Dahlstrom, 1970) develop near the termination of thrusts so that folding and fault propagation are simultaneous. Detachment or d\u00e9collement folds (Chamberlin, 1910) develop near the tip of thrusts or along thrusts, if fault displacement decreases, and may be limited by lower detachments, upper detachments or both.\nThree main kinematic mechanisms have been proposed to account for the amplification of parallel folds: a) folds in which limb dip remains constant and limb length increases through time, so that fold amplification occurs due to hinge migration or kink-band migration (Suppe, 1983); b) folds in which limb length remains constant and limb dip changes through time, and therefore, folds amplify by limb rotation (De Sitter, 1956); and c) folds in which both limb length and limb dip vary through time, so that hinge migration together with limb rotation cause fold amplification (Beutner and DiegeI, 1985). Infinite solutions are possible in the latter case depending on the percentage of contribution of hinge migration versus limb rotation.\nThe hinge migration mechanism has been successfully applied to fault bend folds (e.g., Suppe, 1983, 1985) and fault-propagation folds (e.g., Suppe and Medwedeff, 1990) (Fig. 1), although mechanisms involving limb rotation have been also proposed for fault-propagation folds (e.g., Mitra, 1990). Detachment folds grow by any of the amplification mechanisms mentioned above, i.e., hinge migration, limb rotation or combination of both mechanisms (e.g., Epard and Groshong, 1995; Homza and Wallace, 1995; Poblet and McClay, 1996) (Fig. 2).\nHere I present a set of maps of terminations of different types of simple thrust-related folds with kink-chevron geometries, formed by different amplification mechanisms. These maps have been constructed using serial geological sections across a single structure assuming that cross sections along strike represent different stages of the geometric and kinematic history. The objective of this work is visualizing to what extent the cartographic patterns may be used as a diagnostic element for different types of structures and\/or amplification mechanisms. The reason why maps of periclinal terminations of structures have been chosen is because the maps of cylindrical parts of folds, in which the thrust displacement remains constant along strike, are very similar regardless of the type of fold\/thrust interaction. On the other hand, this work pretends to be a vindication of the importance of continuing constructing geological maps now that, due to budgetary difficulties and other aspects, geological maps seem to have fallen into obsolescence for some earth science professionals.\nBuilding maps and 3D models of terminations of theoretical folds with kink band and chevron geometries is an old technique developed by Faill (1973) to analyze the structure of the Appalachians in central Pennsylvania. This strategy has been used in previous works to build 3D block diagrams of theoretical fault-bend folds (Medwedeff, 1989) and fault-propagation folds (Wilkerson et al., 1991), axial surface maps of theoretical fault-bend folds (Shaw et al., 1994), 3D models and maps of theoretical trishear fault-propagation folds (Cristallini and Allmendinger, 2001), contour maps of theoretical fault-bend folds (Bernal and Hardy, 2002), contour maps of theoretical fault-bend, fault-propagation and detachment folds (Salvini and Storti, 2002), and 3D block diagrams and simplified maps of theoretical detachment folds (Wilkerson et al., 2004) amongst others. Although there are several methods to determine the deformation associated with a structure, the criteria used here to define different strain domains are similar to those employed by Salvini and Storti (2001) to construct geological sections across theoretical fault-bend and fault propagation folds.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nThe assumption that fold geometry variations in space are equivalent to geometric variations in time is an old theory (Elliot, 1976; Means, 1976) that has proved to supply excellent results in some natural examples (e.g., Poblet et al., 1998). One of the great advantages of this theory is that it allows building maps of structures in a simple way. This assumption has been used here for parallel, asymmetric folds, consisting of two planar limbs, a planar crest and very narrow hinges in between them, i.e., with a kink-like geometry (Figs. 1 and 2). The faults related to these folds include a lower detachment, a footwall ramp and an upper detachment in the case of fault-bend folds, i.e., simple-step fault-bend folds, a detachment and a footwall ramp in the case of fault-propagation folds, i.e., simple-step fault-propagation folds, and a detachment in the case of detachment folds. Both the detachments and thrust ramps consist of constant-dip fault surfaces and the transitions from the detachments to the ramps are abrupt. I assumed that the footwalls remain undeformed and are stationary, and therefore, the motion only involves the hangingwalls. Undeformed beds are assumed to be horizontal.\nSerial geological sections across different types of fault-related folds formed by different amplification mechanisms have been built in areas with an along-strike gradient of fault displacement decreasing to zero displacement (Figs. 1 and 2). This has allowed constructing geological maps of periclinal terminations of structures. I have assumed that the fault displacement decreases along strike following an arithmetic progression since it is the simplest type of variation. If a geometric progression or another type of function are employed, the main features of the geological maps obtained would be the same although the structure shape would be distorted with respect to the maps constructed using an arithmetic progression. The tectonic transport vector employed is from south to north and the strike of the thrusts is E-W, so that they move as pure dip-slip, reverse faults. In one case the tectonic transport vector is slightly oblique to the thrust strike, and therefore, it behaves like a dip-slip fault with a small strike-slip component; the value of the angle between the tectonic transport vector and the thrust strike has been kept close to 90\u00b0 to avoid excessive oblique fault displacement. The topography has assumed to be flat in all the sections for simplicity.\nThe fault geometry and depth, as well as the dip of the limbs, have been kept constant in all the geological sections across fault-bend folds except for two cases. In one of them the lower detachment depth varies and in the other one the thrust dip varies, and in both cases, the change along strike of these two geometric elements follow an arithmetic progression, so that they increase as the thrust displacement increases. The length of the limbs and crest of the fault-bend folds has been modified along strike according to the variations in the amount of fault displacement. The transition from the lower detachment to the footwall ramp and the position of the loose line in the across-strike sections before folding\/thrusting have been fixed at the same latitude, except for the case in which the tectonic transport vector is slightly oblique to the thrust strike. The simulated fault-bend folds obey Suppe (1983) equations.\nThe geometry of the detachment and its depth, as well as the dip of the limbs and footwall ramp, have been kept constant in all the geological sections across fault-propagation folds. The footwall ramp length, as well as the length of the limbs and crest, have been modified according to the thrust-displacement variations along strike. The transition from the detachment to the footwall ramp, as well as the position of the loose line in the across-strike sections before folding\/thrusting, has been fixed at the same latitude similarly to fault-bend folds. The simulated fault-propagation folds follow Suppe and Medwedeff (1990) theory.\nIn the case of detachment folds formed by hinge migration, the dip of the limbs, as well as the forelimb versus backlimb length and the crest length, remained constant in all the geological cross-sections constructed, so that only the length of the limbs varied according to thrust displacement variations. In the case of the limb rotation mechanism, the length of the limbs has been kept constant in all the geological cross-sections, whereas the dip of the limbs varied. In the folds formed by combination of hinge migration and limb rotation mechanisms, only the forelimb versus backlimb length has been kept constant, but the length and dip of the limbs, as well as the crest length, varied along strike. The position of the loose line in the across-strike sections before folding\/thrusting has been fixed at the same latitude. The simulated detachment folds correspond to structures developed according to Poblet and McClay (1996) equations.\nThe maps of subsurface fault-bend folds located in southern California and northeastern Pennsylvania (USA), built by Shaw et al. (1994) using seismic data and techniques different from those used here, are consistent with my maps. This suggests that the methodology employed here to construct the geological maps may be reliable.\nThe strain distribution is an additional aspect that can help in the diagnosis of different types of fault-related folds. Thus, we have defined different domains within each map by considering the following criteria: a) whether the rocks have or have not been transported along thrust surfaces and\/or rotated, b) the number of times rocks rolled though active axial surfaces (Suppe et al., 1992) in the case of folds formed by hinge migration or through limited-activity axial surfaces (Poblet and McClay, 1996) in the case of folds formed by limb rotation, and c) whether the axial surfaces belong to folds with high or low interlimb angles. The strain will be minimum in rocks that have not rolled through any axial surfaces and maximum in rocks that have rolled through two axial surfaces, passing through intermediate values such as when rocks have been transported or rotated, they have rolled through one axial surface whose interlimb angle is high or they have rolled through one axial surface whose interlimb angle is low. Although the strain distribution is controlled by other important factors not considered here, one of the advantages of using the criteria above is its easy applicability.\nThe strain distribution displayed in sections across fault-bend folds, fault-propagation folds and detachment folds located in outcrops of the Cantabrian Zone (Spain), built by Masini et al. (2010) and Bulnes et al. (2019) using field data and techniques to predict the deformation different from those used here, is consistent with the deformation distribution shown in my maps. This suggests that the methodology employed here to determine the deformation distribution may be reliable.\n\n\n3\nDifferences between maps of periclinal terminations of thrust-related folds\nThe differences in terms of geometry of the structures and their strain distribution visualized on maps of periclinal terminations of thrust-related folds, which allow identifying different types and different fold amplification mechanisms, are described below.\n\n3.1\nGeometry\nI will start with maps of periclinal terminations of ramp folds and detachment folds formed on thrusts with constant along-strike geometry and I will compare them. Next, I will examine the influence exerted on the maps by the along-strike variation of each of the three following parameters: the detachment depth, the thrust dip, and the angle between the tectonic transport vector and the thrust strike.\nOne of the first aspects to highlight is that fold trends in the terminations of structures formed by orthogonal contraction are not always perpendicular to the tectonic transport direction irrespective whether they are ramp folds or detachment folds (Figs. 3\u20135\n\n\n).\nWhen the thrusts are buried, the trailing and leading anticlinal axial surfaces of the ramp folds get closer as we move towards the central part of the structures (Fig. 3a and b). Regardless of whether the fault-bend fold is in the crestal uplift or crestal widening stage, these two axial surfaces do not join in the case of fault-bend folds leaving a gently dipping or horizontal crest zone in between them, while they end up joining in the case of fault-propagation folds giving rise to a new anticlinal axial surface in the core of the anticline.\nThe differences between ramp folds when the thrusts crop out are (Fig. 3c and d): a) both the fault-bend fold and the related thrust end in the same transversal because the axial surface that delimits the fold lateral extension and emanates from the thrust tip is perpendicular to the thrust, while the fault-propagation fold extends beyond the end of the thrust because the axial surface that emanates from the thrust tip is oblique to the thrust; b) only the backlimb and crest crop out in the fault-bend fold, while the backlimb, the crest and the forelimb crop out in the fault-propagation fold; and c) the crest of the fault-bend fold is in contact with the thrust, while the crest of the fault-propagation folds is not.\nThe difference between the maps of different detachment fold types lies in the fold limbs (Fig. 4). When the hinge migration mechanism intervenes in the fold amplification, the cartographic width of the limbs delimited by the axial surfaces, as well as the cartographic width of the folds, decrease towards their termination. On the contrary, when the amplification mechanism is solely limb rotation, the width of the limbs on the map, delimited by the axial surfaces, remains approximately constant along strike and the width of the whole fold decreases towards the central part of the structure.\nAn important distinction worth noting between ramp and detachment folds is that the traces of the trailing and leading synclinal axial surfaces are not parallel in ramp folds (Fig. 3). This is because the trailing syncline is pinned to the flat-ramp transition, so it reflects the ramp geometry, whereas the forelimb trace is a function of the slip gradient. The trace of the trailing synclinal axial surface tracks that of the leading synclinal axial surface in detachment folds (Fig. 4), because both are a function of the slip gradient.\nFrom the considerations above it follows that it is possible to differentiate three types of structures using the geometrical features depicted on maps of periclinal terminations: fault-bend folds (Fig. 3a and c), fault-propagation folds and detachment folds involving hinge migration (Figs. 3b, d, 4a and 4c), and detachment folds formed by solely limb rotation (Fig. 4b). Fault propagation folds and detachment folds in which hinge migration intervenes are almost indistinguishable unless the thrusts responsible for the fault-propagation folds crop out.\nThe maps of the periclinal terminations of fault-bend folds in which the detachment depth varies (Fig. 5a) and those of fault-bend folds formed on thrusts with constant along-strike geometry (Fig. 3a) exhibit two main differences. Thus, the crest of the structure is never horizontal and none of the axial surfaces is parallel to the trailing synclinal axial surface when the detachment depth varies. If the lower detachment depth increases as the thrust displacement increases, then the trailing anticlinal axial surface will progressively separate from the trailing synclinal axial surface so that the backlimb will be wider as the displacement increases (Fig. 5a). In this case, the map is relatively similar to that of fault-propagation folds (Fig. 3b) and of detachment folds involving hinge migration (Fig. 4a\u2013c) because no horizontal crest occurs. Conversely, if the lower detachment depth decreases as the thrust displacement increases, then the backlimb will become narrower for some thrust displacement values.\nThe main difference between the maps of periclinal terminations of fault-bend folds in which the thrust dip varies along strike (Fig. 5b) and those of fault-bend folds formed on thrusts with constant along-strike geometry (Fig. 3a) is the angle between the leading axial surfaces and the trailing synclinal axial surface. If the thrust dip increases as the thrust displacement increases, the separation between the leading axial surfaces and the trailing synclinal axial surface will increase towards the fold termination (Fig. 5b). If the thrust dip decreases as the thrust displacement increases, the separation between the leading axial surfaces and the trailing synclinal axial surface will decrease towards the fold termination.\nThe maps of periclinal terminations of ramp folds in which the tectonic transport vector is oblique to the thrust strike (Fig. 5c) exhibit one main difference with respect to those in which the tectonic transport vector is perpendicular to the thrust strike (Fig. 3a). Thus, the trailing synclinal axial surface is oblique to the transverse syncline axial surface that marks the fold lateral end in the former ones and perpendicular in the latter. When the angle measured clockwise from the trailing synclinal axial surface to the transverse synclinal axial surface is acute, the thrust will be a reverse fault with a right-lateral component (Fig. 5c). The maps of these structures are somewhat similar to those of detachment folds involving hinge migration (Fig. 4a\u2013c), although the latter do not have a horizontal crest zone. If the angle measured clockwise from the trailing synclinal axial surface to the transverse synclinal axial surface is obtuse, then the thrust will be a reverse fault with a left-lateral component.\n\n\n3.2\nStrain distribution\nFirst, I will describe the strain patterns in ramp folds and detachment folds caused by longitudinal axial surfaces and I will compare them. Next, I will discuss the influence exerted on the maps by transverse axial surfaces.\nIn ramp folds, both fold limbs have rolled once through active axial surfaces; one separates the backlimb from the horizontal rocks transported over the lower detachment and its interlimb angle is high, and another separates the forelimb from the fold crest and its interlimb angle is low (Fig. 6\n). However, in fault-bend folds in a crestal widening stage, the portion of the fold crest adjacent to the forelimb has not rolled through any active axial surface but the portion of the fold crest adjacent to the backlimb has rolled through two active axial surfaces (Fig. 6a), while the crest of fault-propagation folds has not rolled through any active axial surface (Fig. 6b). The horizontal rocks located beyond the forelimb have been transported over the upper detachment in fault-bend folds (Fig. 6a), while they have remained stationary in fault-propagation folds (Fig. 6b). While both complete fold limbs have rolled once through active axial surfaces in detachment folds formed by hinge migration (Fig. 7\na), only small strips of rocks located in the fold limbs and crest adjacent to the axial surfaces have rolled once through axial surfaces of limited activity in detachment folds formed by limb rotation (Fig. 7b). The horizontal rocks located behind the backlimbs have been transported over the detachment, while those beyond the forelimbs have remained stationary because the detachment folds developed above thrust tips (Fig. 7).\nAs with geometry, strain distribution maps allow differentiating three types of structures: fault-bend folds (Fig. 6a), fault-propagation folds and detachment folds involving hinge migration (Figs. 6b and 7a), and detachment folds formed by limb rotation (Fig. 7b). Fault-propagation folds and detachment folds in which hinge migration participates are very similar and undistinguishable based on strain distribution maps.\nOnly active, limited-activity and inactive axial surfaces longitudinal to the structures have been taken into account in the maps presented in Figs. 6 and 7. However, as displacement along the thrusts increases and consequently structures propagate, some areas are also forced to roll through transverse axial surfaces. However, determining which parts of the structures may have rolled through transverse axial surfaces is difficult because these structures may amplify in two different modes described below. a) In the frontal propagation mode, the position of the lateral termination of the structure remains in the same transversal despite increasing the thrust displacement, and therefore, the structure maintains its cartographic length with time (Fig. 8\na). Regarding the strain distribution caused by transverse axial surfaces, the most striking aspect of this propagation mode in fault-bend folds is that a portion of the dipping part of the crest rolls through the transverse anticlinal axial surface that separates the dipping part from the horizontal part of the fold crest. Thus, there would be rocks that have rolled through one transverse axial surface in the horizontal part of the fold crest. b) In the frontal propagation combined with along-strike propagation mode, the lateral termination of the structure moves laterally when the displacement along the thrust increases, and therefore, the cartographic length of the structure increases with time (Fig. 8b). Regarding the strain distribution caused by transverse axial surfaces, in addition to that described in the frontal propagation mode, undeformed rocks roll through the transverse synclinal axial surface that bounds the lateral termination of the structure and end up being incorporated into the structure. Thus, apart from rocks that have rolled through one transverse axial surface in the horizontal part of the fold crest, rocks that have rolled through one transverse axial surface would also be found in the dipping part of the fold crest.\n\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nAlthough the approach presented here is very simple, the geological maps constructed assuming a space-time equivalence yield a general view of the cartographic pattern, in terms of both geometry and deformation distribution, of the periclinal terminations of the most common types of thrust-related folds. Obviously, when the structures are more complex (rounded hinges, footwall involved in the structures, splays emanating from the main thrusts, etc.), the maps are logically more complicated, but even so, the main features should be somewhat similar to those of the maps presented.\nThese maps may serve as models to be compared with maps of folded and thrusted regions in order to help diagnosing different types of structures and\/or amplification mechanisms, but also as a guide to assist in the construction of geological maps in regions where there is little surface and\/or subsurface data (outcrops, well logs, seismics, etc.), the data quality is poor, or the data are unevenly distributed.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJosep Poblet: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing, Visualization, Project administration, Funding acquisition.\n\n","223":"","224":"","225":"","226":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nClinoptilolite, a natural zeolite mineral of the clinoptilolite\/heulandite group, is a non-toxic micro-porous hydrated aluminosilicate composed of a 3-D framework of linked SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra. Partial substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ results in an overall negatively-charged crystal lattice, mainly neutralized by various exchangeable extra-framework cations (commonly K+, Na+, Ca2+ and\/or Mg2+) that are loosely bound within pores and channels of the characteristic crystal structure; H2O molecules may also occupy cavities (see Tschegg et al., 2019 and references cited therein). The exact crystal chemical formula of the natural clinoptilolite mineral studied here is (Ca1.51K1.39Mg0.37Na0.15)[Al5.64Si26.36O72]*11.77 H2O (calculation based on the average chemical composition from 16 microprobe analyses of clinoptilolite; Tschegg et al., 2019). These properties allow clinoptilolite to be used in an extremely broad range of applications, ranging from use as a building stone, in cement\/concrete aggregates, as a paper\/rubber filler, for fertilizing in horticulture, in treating exhaust gas, waste water and organic\/nuclear waste and in veterinary\/human medicine (e.g. Mumpton, 1999; Reh\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2014\"; Eroglu et al., 2017).\nFault zones in the upper crust are important structures that control fluid flow, the location of ore deposits, hydrocarbon reservoir architecture and seismogenic properties (e.g. Robb, 2004; Lonergan et al., 2007; Faulkner et al., 2010; Manzocchi et al., 2010). Due to their abundance in the upper crust, most studies on fault-related processes focus on quartzo-feldspathic or carbonate rocks (for a recent review see Collettini et al., 2019 and references cited therein) and provide strong evidence from both geological data and laboratory experiments about the structural and frictional heterogeneities within crustal faults.\nThe localization of deformation along strong upper crustal faults generally results in the formation of a fault core, within which most of the displacement is accommodated, surrounded by a damage zone of variable thickness, characterized by more distributed deformation (e.g. Caine et al., 1996). The intensity of fragmentation, crushing and comminution increases towards the fault core, within which intense grain size reduction forms narrow bands of ultracataclasites associated with the principal slip surfaces (PSS; e.g. Sibson, 1977; Chester and Chester, 1998; Smith et al., 2011). The preservation of pseudotachylites (e.g. Spray, 1987; McNulty, 1995; Di Toro and Pennacchioni, 2005) and more controversial structures such as polished and mirror-like slickensides (Fondriest et al., 2013; Siman-Tov et al., 2015; Kuo et al., 2016; Pozzi et al., 2018) and\/or truncated grains (Smith et al., 2011; Fondriest et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2016) probably suggests that earthquakes occurred along these structures. Weak faults (Collettini et al., 2019) record a more distributed deformation and result from, for example, dissolution-precipitation creep and mineral replacement reaction-assisted fault weakening. Weak faults accommodate deformation in anastomosing networks of interconnected weak minerals recording SC\/SCC\u2019 fabrics (Evans and Chester, 1995; Niemeijer and Spiers, 2007; Tesei et al., 2013). Seismic rupture nucleation is inhibited by weak faults, which accommodate deformation predominantly by aseismic creep and remain weak over long time scales (Collettini et al., 2019).\nHere we report the first observations of deformation localization in a very pure and homogeneous clinoptilolite-tuff exposed in the open-pit mine at Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec (Slovak Republic), which is run by Zeocem a.s., one of the world's major natural clinoptilolite producers (Tschegg et al., 2019). Although the characterization of fault rocks in this highly porous zeolite-tuff is certainly not representative of the upper crust, the economic importance of clinoptilolite justifies the understanding of rock-fluid interaction during fault localization, as this can significantly influence the purity and thus the quality and possible uses of the raw material. Our studies can also serve as an analogue for deformation localization in other highly porous volcanic or sedimentary rocks, which are in general of economic importance because of their ability to act as pathways and reservoirs for any kind of fluid or gas (e.g. Woods, 2014).\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe East Slovak Basin (Fig. 1\n) is located at the junction of the Western and Eastern Carpathians, and belongs to the Alpine orogenic system. The basin, which is a Neogene intra-montane structure with a total thickness of up to 7\u00a0km of clastic sediments and interlayered rhyolitic rocks and tuffs (Kov\u00e1\u010d et al., 1995), is part of the Trans-Carpathian depression; this developed during collisional processes within the Carpathian orogeny, followed by thermal subsidence and extension at the northern margin of the Pannonian domain (Schmid et al., 2008). The geodynamic evolution of the basin can be divided into a northwestern depocenter active in the Early Miocene, a central depocenter in the Middle Miocene and a southeastern depocenter in the Late Miocene (Jan\u00e1\u010dek et al., 1969). An initial N\u2013S compressive regime was followed by the formation of strike-slip faults associated with dacitic to rhyolitic volcanic activity. The Middle Miocene was characterized by a syn-rift phase of deposition, with calc-alkaline volcanism accompanied by explosive eruptions of silicic magmas, as a consequence of active subduction in the Eastern Carpathian region and rollback of the subducted slab (Lexa et al., 1993; Harangi et al., 2007). At this stage, the East Slovak Basin developed into a back-arc basin, with shallowing-upward clastic sediments intercalated with tuff and tuffite deposits. Crustal thinning was associated with a significant increase in the geothermal gradient (Kone\u010dny et al., 2002; P\u00e9cskay et al., 2006). During the Late Miocene, sedimentation was controlled by thermal subsidence and the basin became a peripheral part of the Pannonian Basin system. During the Pliocene to Pleistocene, the last tectonic stage of the basin evolution was characterized by NE-SW-directed compression (Kov\u00e1\u010d et al., 1995).\nThe studied rocks are from a quarry close to the village of Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec (UTM 34U 556149 5412211), about 30\u00a0km northeast of Ko\u0161ice, at the northern margin of the East Slovak Basin (Figs. 1 and 2\n). The open-pit mine, in which clinoptilolite-tuff (Hrabovec Tuffs) is extracted at six levels, is c. 350 m long (ESE-WNW direction) and 150\u00a0m wide (NNE-SSW direction), with a maximum depth of up to c. 80 m. The c. 100 m thick Hrabovec Tuffs, which are exposed over a strike length of c. 7\u00a0km, are the uppermost of three conformable tuff layers that occur within a Middle Miocene (c. 15 Ma) marine volcano-sedimentary sequence (\u0160amajov\u00e1, 1979). The marine sediments, which in the NW part of the mine form the structurally lowermost level, consist of SW-dipping thickly bedded coarse-grained sandstones interlayered with siltstones and claystones with millimeter-sized detrital white micas. The Hrabovec Tuffs are conformably overlain by cm-to dm-thick bedded turbiditic calcareous siltstones and sandstones of the Vranovsk\u00e9 Formation (Varga et al., 1985), with the same bedding orientation as the sediments below the tuff. The tuff layer was strongly overprinted by diagenetic-anchimetamorphic processes soon after deposition, resulting in the formation of authigenic clinoptilolite and low cristobalite (\u0160amajov\u00e1, 1997; Tschegg et al., 2019).\nEquivalent to volcanic rocks in the central segment of the Carpathian-Pannonian region of similar age, the studied clinoptilolite-tuff has a rhyolitic composition (74.3\u201377.6\u00a0wt % SiO2, 4.09\u20135.49\u00a0wt % Na2O\u00a0+\u00a0K2O) with a generally high-K calc-alkaline affinity (3.07\u20134.28\u00a0wt % K2O; see Tschegg et al., 2019 for further details). Thin-sections show that clinoptilolite occurs as coarse patches forming pseudomorphs of volcanic glass shards, as precipitates in voids and as ultra-fine-grained crystals making up the matrix. Based on these observations, Tschegg et al. (2019) concluded that this huge, remarkably homogeneous and monomineralic natural clinoptilolite-tuff deposit formed from the eruption of an equilibrated magmatic source, with essentially isochemical conditions during the subsequent zeolitization process.\n\n\n3\nSampling methods and analytical techniques\nThe topographic background of the Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec mine in Fig. 2 is an orthophoto mosaic draped onto a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Both the orthomosaic (resolution 6483\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08436, 6.12 cm\/pix) and the DEM (resolution 12718\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016182, 3.06 cm\/pix) were calculated with the photogrammetric software Agisoft Metashape Professional Version 1.5.3 (www.agisoft.com) from 515 aerial pictures taken with a DJI Mavic Pro drone on 23 May 2018. For the automatic double grid mission, the Android App Pix4DCapture 4.4.0 was used, with a 70% overlap between the pictures and a 70\u00b0 inclination of the camera. The constant flight height was 20\u00a0m above the uppermost level of the mine. The geo-referenced orthophoto mosaic (all coordinates are in UTM34 N) was made 50% transparent and draped over the DEM using QGis Version 3.8.2. Due to safety and accessibility issues, structural field measurements have been supplemented with measurements from a virtual outcrop generated from a second, higher resolution flight mission with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone on 3 July 2019, equipped with a Hasselblad L1D-20c. The 3D model (36022681 faces) was calculated with Agisoft from 619 aerial pictures and orientation data of fault zones f1-f5 (Fig. 2) were measured and mapped using LIME (virtualoutcrop.com).\nOriented samples of brittle faults with well-developed polished surfaces were collected in the quarry on levels 3 and 4 (556408E\/5412015N).\nFault surfaces of hand-specimens were imaged with both a Keyence Digital VHX-600 digital microscope, using reflected-light, and a FEI INSPECT-S50 scanning electron microscope (SEM) using secondary electron (SE)-mode, at the University of Vienna.\nPolished thin-sections were made orientated parallel to the observed major slip-direction and perpendicular to the fault surface. Due to the very soft nature of the rock, these were made 100\u00a0\u03bcm thick. The carbon-coated thin-sections were studied using backscattered electron (BSE)-mode and electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) on the INSPECT-S50 SEM (beam conditions were 10\u201315\u00a0kV and 15\u00a0nA), concentrating on the microstructures associated with the fault surfaces.\nFalse-color images of the mineral assemblages were produced based on a combination of BSE and EDS analyses with the Trainable Weka Segmentation plug-in (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017) using the program Fiji ImageJ (imagej.net\/Fiji, Schindelin et al., 2012). The mineral distributions shown have a >80% probability confidence; black regions indicate a pixel uncertainty with a probability of <80%. Using imageJ, fractures in thin-sections were segmented from the matrix, resulting in a binary image that was subsequently divided into a number of subareas of the same size. The area percentage of the fractures in each subarea was calculated using the \u201carea fraction function\u201d in imageJ.\nTo characterize rock-fluid interaction processes during deformation, the compositional difference between the pure clinoptilolite-tuff and the thin dark stained fracture surfaces were analyzed at the laboratories of Glock Health, Science and Research GmbH. Weight losses associated with volatile components (LOI; loss on ignition) were quantified by recording sample weights before and after controlled heating (ignition at 550\u00a0\u00b0C) in a Nabertherm LE 6\/11 muffle oven, until achieving constant weight. Whole-rock major and trace elements were analyzed using a PerkinElmer ELAN DRC-e inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometer (ICP-MS) after sample digestion in an Anton Paar Multiwave 3000 microwave oven. High-purity HNO3 and HF reagents were used for sample digestion. For quality control, USGS CRM RGM-2 and NCS CRM Tibet Sediment (DC70321) standards were analyzed with the samples. Qualitative mineral whole-rock compositions were obtained with a Bruker D-8 Advance diffractometer, equipped with a Cu source. Top-loaded, powdered specimens were scanned under tube conditions of 40\u00a0kV and 40\u00a0mA, using a theta 2-theta configuration, 0.01\u00b0 step size @ 0.5\u00a0s\/step from 6\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 2-theta. Brukers DIFFRAC.EVA software (Version 2016) was used for phase evaluation. Reference sample NIST SRM1976a and an intralaboratory clinoptilolite-tuff reference sample were analyzed before the run to assure the quality of the measurements.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nStructural field data\nThe Hrabovec Tuffs in the Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec mine consist of an extremely homogeneous pale blue-green to green clinoptilolite-tuff without any major internal depositional structures (see below). Some of the stratigraphically lowermost parts on the north side of the mine show a rhythmic cm-layering with an orientation parallel to the over- and underlying sedimentary bedding, dipping about 45\u00b0 towards the SW (Figs. 2, 3\na, and 4\na). This layering is seen more by the refraction of brittle fractures cutting the layering than by any significant compositional changes (Fig. 3B in Tschegg et al., 2019). Elsewhere, the rock breaks easily, sometimes with a very poor conchoidal fracture, suggestive of a homogeneous, fine grain size. The only post-depositional but pre-zeolitization structures in the tuff are conjugate deformation bands, which have a subvertical set striking NW-SE and a second set, which dips at c. 40\u00b0 towards SE (Fig. 3a). After back-rotation of the inclined layers within the tuff to a horizontal position, the deformation-bands are vertical and form orthogonal conjugate sets striking NNW-SSE and ENE-WSW (Fig. 3a). The deformation bands are seen as thin (<1\u00a0cm wide) slightly darker bands; these probably formed during an early stage of tuff diagenesis (Fig. 4b). In thin-sections, no microstructural or compositional difference between deformation bands and host-rocks could be observed in the SEM, suggesting that the microstructures in the deformation bands (e.g. reorientation or crushing of grains) were destroyed by the zeolitization processes.\nThe homogeneous clinoptilolite-tuff is partly cross-cut by numerous meters to tens of meters length fractures that clearly formed after zeolitization (Fig. 4). These fracture-surfaces are sometimes impregnated\/stained with fluid-transported (hydro-)oxides and are not associated with the formation of cataclasites (Figs. 4c, d, e and f). In the SE corner of the mine, on levels 3 and 4 (Figs. 2 and 4a), these fluids infiltrated the clinoptilolite-tuff, forming a few mm- to cm-thick zone along the fractures showing dendritic, tube shape forms (Fig. 4c).\nTwo different fracture-sets have been distinguished (Fig. 3b):\n\n(i)\nMode-I fractures with plumose-structures that record no apparent offset and dip uniformly steeply to the N (Fig. 3b, great circles, Fig. 4d). Most fracture surfaces on the southern side of the mine belong to this type. The majority of the fractures show fringe-cracks and twist-hackles with opposite stepping senses on opposite sides of the plumose-fracture surface, recording a staircase arrangement. Only a few plumose-fracture surfaces with the same stepping sense at both fringe-zones have been observed (Simon et al., 2006). Since the clinoptilolite-tuff is not layered, these fractures are not bounded by bedding-surfaces and record a complex propagation pattern. Tracing the plumose lines from the origin, most structures show a curly pattern. The absence of clear arrest-lines and the planar fractures-surfaces without rip-marks suggest that the fractures propagated in a single event and did not halt temporarily during propagation (Simon et al., 2006). No cataclasites are associated with these Mode-I fractures.\n\n\n(ii)\nFractures (joints and faults with a minor offset) without plumose-structures. These show a great variability of spatial orientations, with most fractures steeply dipping towards the NW or SE (Fig. 3b, pole data). The observation that the poles to all these fractures roughly plot on a NW-SE striking great-circle and that most of the fractures are steeply dipping towards either the NW or the SE suggests that the fractures originated as conjugate mode-II or shear fractures, probably indicating NW-SE extension. Indeed, several fractures record a weak dip-slip lineation on the stained surfaces but, due to the very minor displacement, no evidence of damage in the undeformed clinoptilolite-tuff host-rocks or the formation of cataclasites has been observed in the field.\n\n\n\nThe SE-dipping fractures were reactivated as either normal faults and\/or sinistral strike-slip faults forming 5 major fault zones (f1-5 in Figs. 2 and 3c). Slip on the oxide-stained surfaces created a clear lineation (Fig. 4e) associated with the formation of cohesive and incohesive cataclasites and ultracataclasites up to 1\u00a0cm thick. Scratching and cataclastic reworking of stained fracture surfaces demonstrate reactivation of the earlier fracture system (Fig. 4e). Frequently, zones of incohesive cataclastic fault-rocks are sharply confined by two fault surfaces forming fault-bound lenses (Fig. 4f; Childs et al., 2009). Secondary synthetic Riedel fractures and duplex imbrications within the zone of incohesive cataclasites are the most frequent kinematic indicators, indicating a top-to-the SE normal sense of movement for all mapped major fault zones (f1-f5). These fault-bound lenses sometimes contain incohesive ultracataclasites and fault-gouges with internal SC\/SCC\u2019 fabrics consistent with the top-to-the SE extensional movement of the faults. In some cases, the bordering faults have polished slickensides with mirror-like surfaces that formed in a zone of multiple-generations of cohesive (ultra)cataclasites (Fig. 4e). Locally, dip-slip lineations overprint a strike-slip lineation, demonstrating that the sinistral strike-slip faults pre-dated the NW-SE extensional event (Fig. 4e). The Angelier plot (Fig. 3c) and the cross-cutting relationships (Fig. 4e) suggest a NW-SE extensional event reactivating earlier NE-SW oriented sinistral strike-slip faults. The 5 major SE-dipping normal faults (f1-f5 in Fig. 2), which are associated with this NW-SE extension, cut through the whole mine. The lack of any marker horizons within the very homogeneous tuff makes it difficult to estimate the offset along these normal faults. However, the faults propagate into the overlying sediments demonstrating that the faults were active after deposition of the sediments and have offsets in the order of a few meters.\nThe youngest structures, which have been mainly observed in the NE part of the mine (level 4, Figs. 2 and 4a), are Liesegang-bands. The repeating bands, which are always bounded by dark-stained fractures, gradually increase in color intensity and show sharp boundaries at their maximum intensity, before the next band begins.\n\n\n4.2\nMicrostructural observations\n\n4.2.1\nUndeformed clinoptilolite-tuff\nThe undeformed, c. 100 m thick clinoptilolite-tuff is characterized by two forms of randomly orientated clinoptilolite (Figs. 5\na and b): (1) Relatively coarse idiomorphic grains typically 10\u201330\u00a0\u03bcm in size, occurring either as pseudomorphs of larger volcanic glass shards or infilling voids and (2) ultra-fine-grained clinoptilolite forming the matrix (Figs. 5a and b; cf. Tschegg et al., 2019 for details). Irregularly shaped volcanic quartz, K-feldspar and plagioclase grains, generally <150\u00a0\u03bcm in size, occur within the tuff (Tschegg et al., 2019). Plagioclase grains partly have a thin K-feldspar rim, typically <2\u00a0\u03bcm thick (Figs. 7d and e). In the vicinity of fault surfaces, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm thin K-feldspar veins cut the clinoptilolite-tuff (for more detail about these veins see section 4.2.3.).\nA small number of foraminifera tests (external shells) up to c. 100\u00a0\u03bcm in size occur within the clinoptilolite-tuff (Fig. 2); all of those seen have been altered to K-feldspar. Some of the foraminifera-tests are partly filled with matrix clinoptilolite and partly with fine-grained K-feldspar; these can be interpreted as geopetal indicator confirming the overall upright stratigraphy. Due to the strong alteration, the fossils can only be identified as Globigerina spp. and hence they provide no biostratigraphic constraints (Holger Gebhard, Geological Survey of Austria, pers. comm.). A single crinoid-stem ossicle 120\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter has also been found, replaced by quartz. The presence of these fossils confirms that the tuff was deposited in a marine environment (Tschegg et al., 2019).\n\n\n4.2.2\nOpen mode-I cracks in clinoptilolite-tuff\n\nFigs. 5c and d show the complex growth of new minerals and infilling of fine-grained materials into the open mode I cracks. Up to 50\u00a0\u03bcm sized idiomorphic clinoptilolite crystals grew on the walls of the open cracks, together with c. 50\u00a0\u03bcm sized idiomorphic K-feldspar. Younger Fe-oxides covered these crystals with a sub-\u03bcm thick coating (Fig. 5c). These highly irregular voids in the open mode I cracks were later selectively filled with unstratified fine-grained material derived from incohesive cataclasites and transported from somewhere else (sediments in Fig. 5d). Incomplete infilling of the irregular shaped mode I cracks partly closed-off by idiomorphic crystals record rounded voids, like gas bubbles in fluids, suggesting that the infilling was supported by fluids under gravity. Cross-cutting relationships and infilling of different generations of very-fine-grained material of different compositions and grain sizes suggest that this infilling occurred in several pulses. The sedimentation process is also highlighted by the observation of layers thinning laterally and onlapping onto the idiomorphic clinoptilolite blades. Some of these material-infills are partly replaced or overgrown by Fe oxides in an up to 50\u00a0\u03bcm thick zone, which accentuates the fine layering and give a false impression of a tectonic cleavage.\n\n\n4.2.3\nFault rocks in clinoptilolite tuff\nThe investigated faults in the Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec mine are characterized by a pair of principal slip surfaces (PSSs) along which most displacement was accommodated. By definition, the PSSs are extremely localized and are bordered to the undeformed host-rocks by a less than a few mm-thick zone of proto- to ultracataclasites and\/or foliated host-rocks (Fig. 6\nd). In the following, we investigated one side of the pair of PSSs. What is shown above the PSS (with respect to the orientation of our pictures in Figs. 7\u20139\n\n\n) is in fact the material between a pair of PSSs, which we call the inter-PSS zone. What is shown below is the transition to the undeformed host-rocks, which we call the PSS-host-rock zone.\nUnder the reflected-light microscope, the inter-PSS zone shows the polished microstructure seen in the field, overprinted by distinct fine slickenlines up to 0.2\u00a0mm wide, which may have a whitish color, partially covered by brown to black, dark-stained cataclasites (Figs. 6a and b). The PSSs show some small, 1\u00a0\u03bcm long, elongated pit structures (micropores) aligned with their long axis perpendicular to the fault lineation (Fig. 6c). In the inter-PSS zone, ultra-fine-grained 2\u00a0\u03bcm large idiomorphic K-feldspar crystals grew preferentially aligned parallel to the slickenlines (Fig. 6c).\nSEM-BSE images of sections perpendicular to the fault surface show that the PSS is decorated by a thin bright layer ranging from 1\u00a0\u03bcm to 5\u00a0\u03bcm in thickness that is dominated by K-feldspar, sometimes mixed with Fe and Mn deposits (Fig. 6d). This bright layer has a knife-sharp surface to the inter-PSS zone but has a slightly irregular contact with the PSS-host-rock zone.\nThe inter-PSS zone may contain various generations of ultracataclasites, voids with partly idiomorphic crystals, and ultra-fine-grained material deposited with variable thicknesses subparallel to the PSS. In the sample shown in Figs. 7a and b, up to c. 20\u00a0\u03bcm large idiomorphic to subidiomorphic K-feldspar grains crystallized into an open void (l1 in Fig. 7c). In contrast to the open mode-I cracks described above, no idiomorphic clinoptilolite crystals have been found here. Two other distinct layers (l2 and l3) of a variable thickness and different mineralogical content have been deposited onto the idiomorphic crystals: Layer l2 has an average thickness of 20\u00a0\u03bcm and is composed of a fine-grained porous clinoptilolite matrix with ultra-fine-grained (<2\u00a0\u03bcm) Fe-bearing metalliferous phases surrounded by a thin rim of K-feldspar (Fig. 7c). K-feldspar is heterogeneously distributed; higher concentrations of K-feldspar resulted in lower porosities. Layer l3 is subparallel to and shows a sharp boundary with respect to l2, and has a variable thickness of between 5 and 30\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 7c). The ultra-fine-grained material consists mainly of clinoptilolite, with <2\u00a0\u03bcm sized K-feldspar, and is characterized by elongated fragments of plagioclase oriented with their long-axes parallel to the boundary to l2.\nIn Figs. 7d and e, a zone of cataclasites is separated by the PSS from the foliated PSS-host-rock zone. The cataclasite is mainly composed by K-feldspar, clinoptilolite, plagioclase clasts up to 10\u00a0\u03bcm, and by Mn-\/Fe-oxide bearing minerals. Some of the clasts in the cataclasite are composed of cataclasites and vein material, suggesting repeated reworking of the cataclasites and vein fillings (Fig. 7f). The reworking of vein material is further supported by enrichment of the cataclasites by K-feldspar fragments. Grains record internal cracking and the cataclasite is cut by Riedel fractures (Fig. 7f3) consistent with the kinematics measured in the field. Along the PSS, several clasts in the cataclasite are truncated (Fig. 7f1), indicating slip along the PSS after formation of the cataclasite. Although the cataclasite is sharply bordered by the PSS and by the PSS-host-rock zone, it shows a variable thickness, between 20 and 50\u00a0\u03bcm, resulting in an irregular boundary. These corrugations are filled with ultra-fine-grained material of an unknown origin; Raman spectroscopy failed to identify any mineral, but EDAX analysis showed an Al- and Si-dominated composition (Fig. 7e and f1, f3).\nCohesive cataclasites and\/or foliated clinoptilolite-tuffs, ranging from several tens to hundreds of microns in thickness, form the PSS-host-rock zone (compare Figs. 7a and b with d, e). Fault-associated fractures formed directly adjacent to the PSS, in a zone that is generally <1\u00a0cm wide. The distribution of the fractures (quantified by the area ratio between fractures and the matrix) shows an increase in fracture density towards the PSS, reaching a maximum of c. 3.7% (Fig. 8). The fractures can be subdivided into short and long fracture sets. The former, which comprises fractures with an average length of 1.5\u00a0mm, is characterized by fracture networks localized directly adjacent to the PSS and orientated at 15\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 to the PSS, with a mean at 31\u00b0. In contrast, the long fracture set is dominated by fractures with an average length of 5.5\u00a0mm, mostly orientated at 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 to the PSS, with a mean around 45\u00b0. Some of the fractures are exploited by K-feldspar precipitation along the fracture surface, forming wing-cracks at their tips (Fig. 7b).\nThe cataclasites in the PSS-host-rock zone comprise angular clasts up to 50\u00a0\u03bcm in size of essentially undeformed clinoptilolite-tuff, clasts of cataclasites, and fractured grains of plagioclase, K-feldspar and quartz within a fine-grained clinoptilolite-dominated matrix. Locally, elongated clasts are oriented with their long-axes subparallel to the PSS. Quartz and plagioclase clasts close to the PSS are characterized by fractures and boudin-like structures oriented at a high-angle with respect to their long-axes, in places resulting in V-shaped fractures. These fractures, which have an anti-Riedel orientation, consistent with the Riedel fractures also seen in the cataclasites, are filled with clinoptilolite and\/or K-feldspar (Fig. 9a).\nWithin the cataclasites, clast-cortex grains with cores dominated by plagioclase and a cortex mainly consisting of fine-grained clinoptilolite have been observed (Fig. 9b). The core grains are usually angular, up to c. 100\u00a0\u03bcm in size, and surrounded by an irregular clinoptilolite cortex rim up to 25\u00a0\u03bcm in thickness, creating an overall rounded shape. Tiny curved fracture networks are preserved in the plagioclase at the contact between the core and the surrounding cortex. The cortex rims are composed of clasts from the cataclasite up to 30\u00a0\u03bcm large with long-axes parallel to the rim of the cortex, within an ultra-fine-grained clinoptilolite matrix.\nSome cataclasites have a sharp boundary to the undeformed clinoptilolite host-rock, marked by a secondary fault, but frequently the contact is highly irregular (Fig. 7a) showing injection of fluidized cataclasites into older cataclasites or the host-rock (Fig. 9c). Because these intrusions are composed of the same material as the intruded material, the intrusions are sometimes only visible in BSE images. This is due to the fact that the fluidization impregnated the injected material with either K- or Fe-rich fluids, depositing K-feldspar and\/or ore minerals, resulting in a patchy, paler color.\nApart from the cataclasites, the PSS-host-rock zone is characterized by foliated clinoptilolite, with a foliation oblique to the PSS but systematically inclined with respect to the PSS towards the shear direction. Since this foliation is only observed close to the PSS, in the PSS-host-rock zone, the formation of the foliation is related to displacement along the faults. Dissolution-precipitation creep locally resulted in SC\/SCC\u2019 fabrics consistent with the kinematic movement along the PSS (Fig. 7b). The foliation S and secondary foliation C are both decorated by irregular, anastomosing K-feldspar veins that are also preferentially oriented parallel to elongate clasts or form 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm thick rims around larger clasts (Figs. 7b, e and 9d). K-feldspar veins also formed subperpendicular to the foliation or seal cracks in fractured plagioclase grains (Figs. 7d and e), which have long-axes parallel to the foliation. Some veins connect to the PSS, along which K-feldspar precipitates in veins subparallel to the PSS, or crystallized as idiomorphic crystals in voids (Figs. 7b and c). Rarely, foraminifera tests are preserved in the foliated clinoptilolite, in the PSS-host-rock zone, showing deformation consistent with shortening perpendicular to the foliation (Fig. 9d).\n\n\n\n4.3\nWhole-rock mineralogical and geochemical observations of fault rocks\nThe results of the mineralogical and geochemical analyses are summarized in Table 1\n and Fig. 10\n. Whole-rock XRD analysis of the dark stained, fluid-impregnated fracture and PSS (Fig. 4d) do not show any significant mineralogical differences to rocks unaffected by fluid-infiltration (see Fig. 10a and Tschegg et al., 2019). Clinoptilolite is the major constituent, with minor amounts of cristobalite and feldspars, as well as accessory biotite and quartz. Neither additional mineral phases, such as iron-\/manganese-oxides or hydroxides nor substantially elevated diffraction-pattern background levels, which could indicate increased amounts of amorphous phases, were detected in the XRD scans of the impregnated specimens.\nThe geochemical results, however, indicate which elements are responsible for the dark staining. The impregnated rock surfaces are characterized by higher amounts (>80 relative %) of MnO, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ba, Pb and most rare-earth elements (REEs, La\u2013Lu) whilst Fe2O3, Ga and As are moderately enriched (>30 relative %). SiO2, Al2O3, CaO and K2O concentrations are essentially the same in the two rock types and Na2O is slightly lower compared to the average clinoptilolite-tuff composition (Fig. 10b). The 1:1 line shown in Fig. 10b indicates that, apart from the higher concentrations of the mostly siderophile elements (after White, 2013) and REEs listed above, the element concentrations are fairly similar.\nThe mineralogy of the cataclasites within a fault-bound lens and the adjacent (c. 1\u00a0dm distance) host-rocks (Fig. 4f) are essentially identical, but differ slightly compared to the clinoptilolite-tuff normally found at Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec, with marginally higher feldspar and a bit little lower cristobalite contents (Fig. 10a; compare also Tschegg et al., 2019). Their chemical compositions are also essentially the same; only elements such as Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, Ba, Pb and most REEs, which were identified as being related to the staining of the tuff, have slightly higher concentrations in the cataclasite compared to the adjacent host\u2013rock (Fig. 10c). When compared to the average host-rock composition, the fault-bound lens samples show minor (18\u201330 rel. %) enrichment of Al2O3, CaO, Na2O and K, with less SiO2 contents. The trace elements concentrations, including REEs, are strikingly similar.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nStructural evolution of the clinoptilolite-tuff from Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec\nBased on the structural field-data and microtectonic investigation, the following structural evolution of the clinoptilolite deposit has been inferred:\nThe tuff was conformably deposited over meter-thick bedded coarse-grained Lower Badenian (c. 16-15\u00a0Ma) sandstones and is overlain by Middle Badenian (c. 15 Ma) turbiditic graded sand- and mudstones (Fig. 2). The bedding in the underlying and overlying sediments, together with a rarely developed layering in the tuff (Fig. 4a), has an essentially uniform dip towards the SW (mean 210\/40\u00b0; Fig. 3a). Although no channels or erosive non-depositional surfaces have been observed, a disconformity at the bottom of the tuff and the bottom of the overlying turbiditic sediments cannot be excluded.\nThe only pre-zeolitization deformation structures in the tuff are locally developed and orthogonal sets of conjugate deformation-bands (Fig. 4b), which probably formed shortly after deposition of the volcanic ash, within a still unconsolidated state of the tuff. Although the deformation-bands form conjugate sets, the structures were, together with the host-rocks, strongly overprinted by diagenetic alteration processes (= zeolitization), and hence are often hardly visible and give no indication about their kinematic formation (e.g. dilation, compaction or shear deformation-bands).\nThe first structures recognized are mode-I fractures with plumose-structures, joints and conjugate shear fractures with no visible offset (Figs. 4b and c). All these features are pervasively impregnated by manganese and are not associated with the formation of cataclasites. The occurrence of idiomorphic clinoptilolite crystals growing in veins that cross-cut the tuff suggests that the formation of the veins and the mode-I fractures occurred during a late stage of zeolitization. There are no clear arguments about the timing of the tilting of the whole package (clinoptilolite together with the over- and underlying sediments) towards the SW; but, assuming that the tilting of the bedding occurred after this deformation event, these data indicate NW-SE extension after back-rotation of about 40\u00b0 around a horizontal rotation axis.\nBoth WNW- and SE-dipping fractures were first reactivated as sinistral strike-slip faults, overprinted by normal faults, indicating again a phase of NW-SE extension. These faults are probably associated with both aseismic creep and seismic deformation; this is discussed in the next section. Statistically, the SE-dipping normal faults are clearly the dominant system, some of which can be mapped throughout the quarry (f1-f4, Fig. 2) and which also record the largest observable displacements, of up to a few meters of normal offset. The reactivation is mainly suggested by scratching and cataclastic deformation of the previously formed manganese staining and by the geochemical data of the cataclasites, which also suggest reworking of the earlier stained joint surfaces within the fault-bound lenses (Fig. 4f). Cross-cutting relationships of slickenlines indicate that movement on the sinistral strike-slip faults occurred between the two phases of NW-SE extension. The only markers that suggest that the components of normal displacement were in the order of a few meters are the contacts between the tuff and the bedding within the overlying sediments (Fig. 2). No markers for estimating the strike-slip offsets have been found within the tuffs. Although idiomorphic K-feldspar minerals grew in voids created by fault slip, no idiomorphic growth has been seen in clinoptilolite. Nevertheless, clinoptilolite grew in anti-Riedel fractures (Fig. 9a) and since the fractures are not filled with cataclasites, this growth must have been synchronous with anti-Riedel fracturing. This observation suggests that the strike-slip faulting also occurred within the P\/T and fluid environment that allowed clinoptilolite growth and hence soon after the phase of open Mode-I fracturing.\nIn conclusion, the structural observations are consistent with the Middle Miocene-Pleistocene tectonic evolution of the East Slovakian Basin, which was mainly characterized by attenuation of the crust along normal and transtensional strike-slip faults at the northern marginal part of the Pannonian Basin System (Kov\u00e1\u010d et al., 1995; P\u00e9cskay et al., 2006; Harangi et al., 2007). Note that no evidence for NE-SW Pliocene-Pleistocene compression (Kov\u00e1\u010d et al., 1995) has been observed in the Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec mine.\n\n\n5.2\nEvidence for velocity strengthening and weakening behaviours in clinoptilolite-tuff\nFaults may record, in their microstructures, periods of velocity strengthening deformation, during which fluid-assisted processes (dissolution-precipitation creep and mineral replacement reactions) may lead to the formation of foliated fault rocks characterized by interconnected and anastomosing networks of SC\/SCC\u2019 fabrics (Evans and Chester, 1995; Niemeijer and Spiers, 2007; Tesei et al., 2013). In contrast, dynamic weakening processes may be associated with extreme deformation localization and may be associated with microstructures such as ultra-fine-grained cataclasites, polished mirror-like slickensides (Fondriest et al., 2013; Siman-Tov et al., 2015; Kuo et al., 2016; Pozzi et al., 2018), truncated grains (Smith et al., 2011; Fondriest et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2016; Smeraglia et al., 2017), clast-cortex grains (Boutareaud et al., 2008, 2010; Smith et al., 2011) or pseudotachylites (e.g. Spray, 1987; McNulty, 1995; Di Toro and Pennacchioni, 2005).\nIn the investigated fault rocks, we document several microstructures that may be indicative of seismic slip. Such microstructures, which have been widely studied in carbonates (Rowe and Griffith, 2015 and references cited therein), comprise polished slickensides, truncated grains along PSSs and clast-cortex grains, which are here for the first time described in very homogeneous zeolite-tuffs (Figs. 4e, 7 and 9b). Moreover, our microstructural observations suggest that the (ultra)cataclasites found in the PSS-host-rock zone behaved, in part, as a mobile, fluidized material (Figs. 7a and 9c). The protrusion of sub-layers into one another along highly irregular, bulbous boundaries is consistent with the development of a fluid of relatively low viscosity (Brodsky et al., 2009). The occurrence of fluidization structures, ultracataclasites with irregular cuspate-lobate boundaries and the injections of ultracataclasites into the host-rocks further supports the interpretation of seismicity recorded in the investigated faults (Brodsky et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2011; Fondriest et al., 2013; Rowe et al., 2012; Demurtas et al., 2016; Smeraglia et al., 2017). Co-seismic fluidization, which allows rock particles of ultracataclasites to be passively transported by the fluid phase, has been suggested to result from the expansion or vaporization of pore fluids to exceed lithostatic stress values, leading to a reduction of the effective normal stress across seismic faults (Sibson et al., 1975; Rice, 2006). Furthermore, the presence of rounded clast-cortex grains consisting of a central angular clast surrounded by an outer cortex of fine-grained material that defines the rounded structure has been suggested to form during localized fluidization of the distinct slip layers at probably seismic slip-velocities (Smith et al., 2011).\nAll these micro-structures have been critically discussed to establish whether they may form at seismic slip-rates and if they are indicative of dynamic weakening (Fondriest et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013, 2015; Verberne et al., 2013; Siman-Tov et al., 2015). We are fully aware that recent experiments have shown that most of these criteria can also form under different and aseismic conditions (e.g. Han et al., 2011; Han and Hirose, 2012; Rempe et al., 2014; Pozzi et al., 2018). Furthermore, it can be challenging to differentiate seismic slip from slow or aseismic slip based on evidence in the rock record and all classifications of whether or not a microstructure can be taken as evidence of seismic slip depend on the definition of \u201cseismic slip\u201d used (see Rowe and Griffith, 2015). Nevertheless, because all of these microstructures are found close to the PSS, we propose that at least some faults in the Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec mine developed by seismic rupture propagation. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that dynamic chemo-mechanical feedback processes in the clinoptilolite-tuffs might differ significantly from processes in carbonate or quartzofeldspathic rocks and require further investigations.\n\n\n5.3\nRock-fluid interaction during faulting in clinoptilolite-tuff\nMicrostructural, geochemical, and mineralogical observations indicate that one or probably several fluid pulses occurred within the rocks. These precipitated K-feldspar and (amorphous) oxides and\/or hydroxides of trace-elements such as Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, Ba, Fe, Pb and REEs. Multiple fluid pulses are suggested by different fluid-related microstructures; these record a relative age sequence by their cross-cutting relationship (e.g. idiomorphic K-feldspars in Fig. 7c and reworking of K-feldspar in cataclasites in Fig. 7f). Neither the potassium nor the trace-elements observed in the ultracataclasites, idiomorphic K-feldspar crystals and veins in the PSS-host-rock zone could have originated from the original clinoptilolite-tuff, since none of the phases in the mineral paragenesis contains significant amounts of those elements. Therefore, we assume that an external fluid source used the sporadically appearing fracture pathways to infiltrate the rock between and\/or during deformation. These fluid pulses circulated along voids and\/or fractures, leading to a spatially limited, generally <0.5\u00a0mm wide, impregnation of the rock adjacent to fracture surfaces and the precipitation of K-feldspar as idiomorphic crystals in voids or as micro-veins in the PSS-host-rock zone (Table 1, Figs. 4, 7 and 10).\nNo Mn-bearing mineral phases, such as cryptomelane, hollandite, pyrolusite or todorokite, which could be expected to be responsible for the staining in the tuffs, have been identified by X-ray diffraction, although observed in similar tuffs elsewhere (e.g. Carlos et al., 1993). As no crystalline metalliferous phases have been detected, we suggest that impregnation of mainly the host-rock macro-pores took place. Further, grain boundaries and the zeolite-framework channels (meso- and micro-porosity of the rock) could have been potential fluid-pathways, with associated trace-metal deposition. However, as the observed rock-fluid interaction processes are limited to the PSS and the PSS-host-rock zone, a short-lived injection-period of the fluids along the fractures is assumed.\nThe whole-rock mineralogical and geochemical analyses of the fault-bound lens samples (cataclasite and adjacent rock) clearly illustrate their almost identical mineralogical and geochemical compositions (Table 1 and Fig. 10), indicating that essentially no alteration (fluid involvement, gain\/loss of elements) occurred during faulting. The slight enrichment of mainly siderophile trace-elements in the cataclasite is most likely attributed to impregnated fault surfaces that were reworked during cataclasis.\nIn summary, fluids mainly enriched in potassium and siderophile trace-elements show a complex interaction with movements along the faults, but rock-fluid interaction is (if at all) limited to a few millimetres adjacent to the fault surfaces. This result is of great economic importance for the Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec mine, because a more pervasive infiltration by metal-enriched fluids would significantly influence the purity and thus the quality and possible uses of the raw material.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nDeformation in the clinoptilolite-tuff open-pit mine close to Ni\u017en\u00fd Hrabovec (Slovak Republic) was accommodated along faults that reactivated both joints characterized by plumose structures and fractures. These structures were in a favorable orientation to accommodate the overall Miocene NW-SE directed extension in this region.\nFaults in the porous clinoptilolite-tuff are extremely localized, showing, with the exception of dm-thick fault-bound lenses, almost no damage zones. Most of the deformation is localized along PSSs and within a few mm-thick PSS-host-rock zones. Both the PSS and the PSS-host-rock zone record a complex history of multiple fault slip events assisted by fluid pulses from an external source, enriched in potassium and mainly siderophile trace-elements.\nThe recorded microstructures are indicative of velocity hardening, accommodated by dissolution precipitation creep (SC\/SCC\u2019 foliation), and velocity weakening processes, showing the formation of multiple ultracataclasite layers along PSSs.\nMicrostructures such as polished slickensides, injection of fluidized cataclasites, clast-cortex grains and truncated grains along PSSs suggest that at least some of the faults formed during seismic slip.\nBoth deformation and rock-fluid interaction are extremely localized along fractures and do not affect the major part of the clinoptilolite-tuff host-rocks, guaranteeing a pure, high quality material of great economic importance and value.\n\n","227":"","228":"","229":"","230":"","231":"","232":"","233":"","234":"","235":"","236":"","237":"","238":"","239":"","240":"","241":"","242":"","243":"","244":"","245":"","246":"","247":"","248":"","249":"","250":"","251":"","252":"","253":"","254":"","255":"","256":"","257":"","258":"","259":"","260":"","261":"","262":"","263":"","264":"","265":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFault-related pseudotachylytes are generally considered to result from frictional heating during coseismic brittle faulting (Sibson, 1977; Grocott, 1981; Swanson, 1992; Magloughlin, 1992; Kirkpatrick et al., 2009; Toy et al., 2011). Field studies have documented such tectonic pseudotachylytes from dominantly cataclastic rocks as well as from ductile mylonitic environments. Conceptual models for deep crustal-scale fault zones, in particular strike-slip faults (Sibson, 1983; Swanson, 1992), suggest that fault-related pseudotachylytes may be expected to develop from deep greenschist facies levels around 12\u201316\u00a0km depth to entirely brittle levels around 2\u20134\u00a0km (Sibson and Toy, 2006). Pseudotachylytes that developed at deep levels may thus overprint foliated structures formed during slow ductile creep. Pseudotachylytes from such regimes have been reported, e.g., from the Outer Hebrides Thrust of northwest Scotland (Sibson, 1977, 1980), the Musgrave block in central Australia (Wenk and Weiss, 1982), from mylonitic gneisses of the Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Massif in the French Pyrenees (Passchier, 1982, 1984), the Late Paleozoic mylonites of the southern coast of Maine (Swanson, 1988), and from the M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Zone in W Norway (Sherlock et al., 2004). The presence of fault-related pseudotachylytes in these sheared rocks may reflect the progressive interplay of mainly ductile and genuinely brittle processes during the waning stages of ductile shear, possibly associated with a long-term gradual transition to the brittle field. Alternatively, these structures may have developed completely unrelated to the earlier shear history, during an essentially much later, brittle reactivation event.\nThis paper is concerned with pseudotachylyte structures in a greenschist facies shear zone at Cap de Creus (E Pyrenees, Spain). The region is world-famous among structural geologists for the excellent exposure of ductile shear zones (e.g., Carreras et al., 1977, 1980; Druguet, 1997; Carreras, 2001, and references therein; Fusseis et al., 2006; Fusseis and Handy, 2008). Despite detailed structural research in the area, however, the pseudotachylytes of Cap de Creus have so far, to the best of our knowledge, not been described in the structural literature. In this paper, we aim (1) to document pseudotachylyte structures and microstructures from a shear zone in the Cap de Creus area, (2) to present the results of 40Ar\/39Ar dating of the pseudotachylytes to assess the temporal and tectonic context within which they formed, and (3) to estimate seismic source parameters associated with the development of the pseudotachylytes. This allows us to place the structures, dating results and inferred seismic parameters in the larger scale context of the Alpine orogeny as outlined in the discussion below.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting of the pseudotachylyte-bearing shear zone\nCap de Creus in NE Spain forms the easternmost end of the Pyrenees, the Alpine fold-thrust belt that formed by collision of Iberia and Eurasia. The Pyrenees contain a core known as the Axial Zone exposing Paleozoic rocks that were intensely deformed and metamorphosed during the Variscan orogeny (Zwart, 1979), and a Mesozoic-Cenozoic cover of mostly non-metamorphic sediments that are only affected by Alpine deformation processes (Fig. 1\n, inset). The region around Cap de Creus belongs to the Axial Zone and exposes uppermost Proterozoic to Cambrian, dominantly siliciclastic sediments (Carreras, 2001; Casti\u00f1eiras et al., 2008), metamorphosed during the Variscan orogeny to LP-HT amphibolite facies metagreywackes and cordierite-sillimanite biotite schists up to migmatite-grade (e.g., Druguet, 1997; see Fig. 1). The area is thus dominated by dark-coloured metagreywackes and metapelites, with an intensely developed foliation parallel to the axial planes of isoclinal folds, often refolded by second-generation tight folds with crenulated structures along their axial planes. These structures, conveniently described in terms of first and second generation (D1, S1 and D2, S2) deformations, show N\u2013S to NE-SW oriented trends and are both associated with Variscan LP-HT metamorphism. In addition, coarse-grained pegmatitic granitoids (Fig. 1) have intruded the higher-grade rocks mainly between the first and second deformation (Druguet et al., 1997). Granitoids and migmatites at Cap de Creus are not dated, but nearby exposures of these rocks further west yielded ages of 299\u2013290\u00a0Ma (Druguet et al., 2014).\nA set of commonly SE-NW and less frequently EW striking, greenschist facies ductile shear zones transect the amphibolite facies Variscan structure. They are developed in the Cap de Creus area at a regional scale (Carreras, 2001; Fusseis et al., 2006) and show estimated displacements of the order of 1\u00a0km. One of these shear zones, consisting of an intricately anastomosing network of smaller scale shears, separates the rocks around the Cap de Creus light house from the westerly part of the area (Fig. 1). This shear zone, running from cala Cullar\u00f3 in the north via cala Culip to cala Jugadora and cala Fredosa to the S and SE, has a moderate to steep dip to the NE. Both the exposures near cala Cullar\u00f3 and the branch running from cala Culip to cala Fredosa (Fig. 1) contain pseudotachylytes, developed along an intensely sheared mylonitic matrix as described below.\nThe Cap de Creus shear zones formed under retrogressive metamorphic conditions and their age has for a long time been the subject of debate, since both Alpine and Variscan ages have been proposed (see, e.g., Carreras, 2001). Recent muscovite 40Ar\/39Ar dating of shear zones in the area (Vissers et al., 2017) have yielded Jurassic (Oxfordian) ages between 159.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43 and 175.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.10\u00a0Ma (all dates are quoted at the 95% confidence level). The dating of muscovite from the pseudotachylite-hosting cala Culler\u00f3 \u2013 cala Fredosa shear zone gave a 162.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.96\u00a0Ma 40Ar\/39Ar age (the location of the dated exposure is indicated in Fig. 1 by a white star). One shear zone in the region, in addition, yielded an age of 58.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.55\u00a0Ma (Vissers et al., 2017).\n\nVissers et al. (2017) showed that the present steep dip of the shear zones and the more or less horizontal strongly attenuated metamorphic field gradient are most likely the result of Alpine tilting and represent a Jurassic low-angle extensional shear zone that formed at the eastern Iberian margin. Extensive offshore geophysical imaging on the eastern Iberian margin has demonstrated that during the middle Jurassic eastern Iberia underwent hyperextension (Etheve et al., 2018) during slow opening of the Alpine Tethys ocean (Vissers et al., 2013), in which context the low-angle extensional shear zones of Cap de Creus fit well (Vissers et al., 2017; van Hinsbergen et al., 2019).\n\n\n3\nStructures of the cala Cullar\u00f3 \u2013 cala Fedrosa shear zone\n\n3.1\nDuctile shear structures and associated assemblages\nThe shear zone is characterized by intense stretching and drag of earlier S1 and S2 foliations in the metapsammitic and pelitic wall rock, and an intensely developed mylonitic foliation Sm dominating the central parts of the shear zone (Fig. 2\na and b). In many localities, asymmetric extensional crenulation cleavages (e.g. Platt and Vissers, 1981) consistently indicate top-to-the-SE motion (Fig. 2c), and trains of small-scale isoclinal folds with axial planes inclined to the mylonitic foliation equally suggest movement of the hanging wall to the SE, i.e., a dextral sense of motion in map view (Fig. 1). The mylonitic shear zone rocks are notably lighter coloured than the adjacent biotite-rich wall rock due to greenschist facies alteration of the precursor amphibolite facies assemblage (e.g., Fusseis and Handy, 2008). The greenschist facies mylonites are commonly fine-grained (grainsizes of 100 ?m or less) and are dominated by oriented muscovite and biotite occasionally interleaved with chlorite, quartz, and often albite (Fig. 2d), whilst several samples also contain clinozoisite. Some of the mylonitic schists are very rich in mica (\u226b 50%). In such mica-rich rocks, extensional crenulation cleavage planes may be well developed (Fig. 2d) and decorated with very fine-grained intergrowths of chlorite and biotite (Fusseis and Handy, 2008). Porphyroclasts of colourless mica and feldspar, as well as occasional mica-feldspar pseudomorphs after andalusite, may occur enclosed in the fine-grained mylonitic matrix.\n\n\n3.2\nPseudotachylyte structures and microstructures\nAt several localities in the shear zone pseudotachylytes are exposed (black dots and stars in Fig. 1). The geometry of these structures suggests that they are relatively late features. Concordant veins of dark very-fine-grained to cryptocrystalline material, either of variable thickness or almost perfectly planar, may occur at different levels in the shear zone (Fig. 3\na). Their common persistence over several meters and their very sharp contacts with the mylonitic wall rock strongly suggest that these veins are fault veins (Sibson, 1977). The veins may show clear variations in thickness reminiscent of pinch-and-swell structures with a wavelength of one to a few dm, but where they are approximately planar they commonly show thicknesses between 1 and 4\u00a0mm, with a mean of 2\u00a0mm. They may also be discordant to the main mylonitic foliation, truncating and cutting across marker horizons (Fig. 3b). Associated with the fault veins are usually small, high-angle tapering veins interpreted as injection veins (Toy et al., 2011, Figs. 3c and 4\na). The fault vein \u2013 injection vein geometries such as observed at Cap de Creus are considered to be a principal characteristic feature of tectonic pseudotachylytes (Sibson and Toy, 2006).\nMore complex observed pseudotachylyte geometries range from ladder structures (Sibson, 1977) (Fig. 3d) to breccias (Fig. 3e and f). These structures, equivalent to the pseudotachylyte generation zones of Grocott (1981), are essentially formed by two subparallel fault veins linked by high-angle injection vein structures, where larger amounts of dark pseudotachylyte separate increasingly isolated fragments of wall rock. Small-scale Riedel-type fractures decorated by pseudotachylyte (Fig. 3e) occasionally contribute to the brecciation. The dilatation necessarily involved in the development of these structures confirms that they are genuinely brittle.\nAt this stage, it needs to be emphasized that the field observations as such do not prove that the glassy cryptocrystalline material in the fault and injection veins illustrated in Fig. 3 result from frictional heating during coseismic motion along the pertinent fault surfaces. We therefore proceed to inspect the microstucture of the pseudotachylyte in search for features diagnostic for the former presence of a melt phase. Fig. 4a shows a fault vein sampled from exposure A near the northwestern end of the cala Culler\u00f3 - cala Fedrosa shear zone. Numerous fine-grained clasts in the margin of the fault vein show a marked shape preferred orientation (Fig. 4b) that could have developed as the clasts were transported by flow of a matrix melt, whilst a millimetre-scale isoclinal fold in the centre of the fault vein (Fig. 4a) seems consistent with flow of an essentially fluid (liquid) phase (Fig. 4a, note fold hinge F). In addition, some small fragments enclosed in the dark pseudotachylyte matrix show embayments compatible with corrosion by a melt (Fig. 4b and c). The micron-scale pseudotachylyte microstructure, illustrated in the backscattered electron micrographs of Fig. 4c and d, is characterized by 20 ?m scale clasts embedded in a matrix of 1\u20135 ?m size platelets of biotite intergrown with Ca-poor plagioclase and occasional quartz with an ultrafine grained microporphyritic texture that is clearly igneous (Fig. 4e and f). Semi-quantitative microchemical analyses of the ultrafine grained material are presented in the supplementary data. A general lack of typical devitrification microstructures like spherulites, reported from pseudotachylytes by other workers (see e.g., Spry, 1969), lead us to interpret the biotite-feldspar matrix as the product of crystallization from a melt rather than devitrification of a glass phase, but we note that occasional aggregates of radially arranged biotites (Fig. 4e) may well have grown from initially dendritic nuclei.\n\n\n3.3\nKinematics of the pseudotachylytes\nKinematic interpretations of the ductile shear zone structures at Cap de Creus are generally straightforward because of the excellent exposure of kinematic indicators (e.g., Carreras, 2001). The kinematics of the pseudotachylyte bearing fault veins, however, is more problematic because the shear direction data are largely limited to few faint, groove-like lineations on fault vein \u2013 wall rock interfaces. The significance of these faint lineations on the pseudotachylyte fault veins is enigmatic, but we hypothesize that they originate from a cataclastic precursor at the onset of frictional melting, because the melt clearly has a proportion of rigid clasts.\nAn interesting exposure to study kinematic aspects of the pseudotachylytes was found in locality G (Fig. 1) illustrated in Fig. 5\n. The exposure allows a view onto the plane of a concordant fault vein parallel to the mylonitic foliation Sm (Fig. 5a). The fault vein is partly eroded, revealing numerous small injection veins in the wall rock immediately underneath. A detail is shown in Fig. 5b, in which at least two veins show an en-echelon tension gash geometry suggesting that the two veins are in fact shear structures in the plane of Sm. As the orientation of the erosion surface approximates that of the mylonitic foliation Sm, hence of the concordant fault vein, we may analyse the distribution of the various injection veinlets in the plane of the fault vein. The result is shown in Fig. 5c and d. The rose diagram shows a distribution that at least qualitatively matches the expected distribution of faults in the XY plane when oriented as in Fig. 5e. The data suggest a shallowly SE plunging principal displacement axis x, close to the trend of a set of joints (j) in the black pseudotachylyte material that might represent tensile structures perpendicular to the principal direction of shortening in the plane of Sm. These results are consistent with a subhorizontal direction of motion parallel to the faint groove-like lineations on fault vein walls (see also Fig. 11 below).\nWhilst the above analysis suggests a subhorizontal direction of motion along the pseudotachylyte fault veins, the associated movement sense remains unclear. With the aim to elucidate the movement sense, we address a pseudotachylyte exposure (locality D in Fig. 1) comprising an >6\u00a0m long section with multiple fault vein structures (Fig. 6\n). In the NW part of the exposure the structure is dominated by a system of two roughly concordant fault veins with pseudotachylyte-bearing breccia in between (Fig. 3e), passing to the SE into a single fault vein with several pseudotachylyte lenses and high-angle injection veins. At less than 0.5\u00a0m below this fault vein, two discordant fault veins cut downward to the SE, and enclose a dm-scale duplex structure of at least four slices, each bounded by pseudotachylyte-bearing faults (Fig. 6b and c). The orientation of the outcrop is favourable for kinematic interpretation of the ductile structure, because the mylonitic foliation is roughly perpendicular to the erosion surface, with the ductile stretching direction approximately in the plane of the outcrop. Likewise, the fault vein structures are roughly perpendicular to the erosion surface and the faint lineations that may reflect the direction of brittle motion are again oriented in the plane of the outcrop. This implies that the duplex structure of Fig. 6 can potentially be restored. Fig. 7\n shows a restoration of the structure assuming that the duplex geometry was formed in four single jerks (illustrated in Fig. 7b\u2013e), and that fault veins may have slightly been curved as a result of slow post-seismic deformation. Three out of four of the associated displacements are NW-directed and resemble thrusts, whilst motion along fault 2 is SE directed. Note that the fault structures tend to shorten, hence thicken the mylonite zone. As the restoration does not really pose geometrical problems, it is hypothesized that the restoration may be valid and that the duplex structure indeed reflects the cumulative effect of at least four pseudotachylyte-generating fault motions, with estimated displacements of about 15, 5\u201310 and 25\u201340\u00a0cm respectively, while the displacement during the last stage (fault 4 in Fig. 7d and e) is not well constrained. It is unknown if the four stages of motion are sequential within one phase of brittle deformation, or that they represent different phases. As opposed to the top-to-the-SE ductile shear sense of the host mylonites, the thrust-like motions along the duplex forming faults indicate top-to-the-NW motion, i.e., a sinistral movement sense in map view, except for a small top-to-the-SE displacement of 5\u201310\u00a0cm along the stage 2 fault, consistent with the orientation of the Riedel fracture shown in Fig. 3e. For the overlying concordant fault veins higher in the exposure there are no constraints on the associated displacements.\nAt this stage, we emphasize that the pseudotachylyte structures documented here at Cap de Creus are clearly younger than the ductile shear zone structures. Irrespective of the excellent degree of exposure, we have not found any pseudotachylyte with evidence of subsequent ductile shearing, expected in case the pseudotachylytes and the shear structures were broadly coeval (such as e.g. described by Sibson (1977) from the Outer Hebrides). The opposed kinematics of the pseudotachylytes relative to that of the ductile shearing in the host rock and the overprinting relationships both suggest that the brittle deformation was not coeval with the ductile shear. Instead, the field data suggest that the pseudotachylytes reflect a younger, brittle seismogenic overprint postdating ductile shearing.\n\n\n\n4\n\n40Ar\/39Ar dating of the pseudotachylytes\nOur field study of the cala Culler\u00f3 \u2013 cala Fredosa ductile shear zone reveals ubiquitous evidence of a brittle overprint by pseudotachylyte-type fracture geometries. The associated fault veins are, in most cases, approximately concordant with the earlier mylonitic shear zone foliation, whilst less frequent discordant fault veins and injection veins clearly cut the ductile structures. As emphasized above, these geometrical relationships can be interpreted in two ways: (1) the pseudotachylyte structures may have developed progressively during the waning stages of ductile shear which, given the Jurassic age of the shear zone, would imply a Jurassic age of the pseudotachylytes, or (2) these structures developed completely unrelated to the earlier shear history during an essentially much later brittle deformation event. To distinguish between these different options, we have employed the stepwise heating 40Ar\/39Ar technique to unravel the timing of pseudotachylyte formation. Obtaining age constraints of fault-generated pseudotachylytes can be an analytical challenge since they are most exclusively heterogeneous and can contain a complex mixture of minerals contained in the melt matrix with different diffusive properties and varying degrees of entrained unmelted host rock clasts (Di Vincenzo et al., 2004) which may disturb and\/or elevate the apparent ages away from their formation ages. Despite of these challenges, several attempts have succeeded in obtaining reliable geochronology by careful data interpretation using stepwise heating and\/or high resolution UV laser extraction methods, usually in tandem with microstructural analysis at different scales (e.g. Wenk et al., 2000; Di Vincenzo et al., 2004; Sherlock et al., 2004; Pennacchioni et al., 2006; Sherlock et al., 2009; Zanchetta et al., 2011; Di Vincenzo et al., 2013; Di Vincenzo et al., 2019).\nWe have selected pseudotachylyte samples from four different exposures along the shear zone (Fig. 1, exposures A, B, D and G; stars denote samples C1A at A, CdC14-20\u00a0at\u00a0B, D1A and D1B at D, and T1A and T1B at G, see also Fig. 9\n\n below). In view of a possible heterogeneity of the pseudotachylyte ages, we choose to test the reproducibility of the results by analyzing several splits of samples C1A, D1A and D1B. In addition to cm-scale sample CdC14-20 from exposure B, we prepared polished slabs and thin sections of pseudotachylite fault and injection veins from the other exposures (A, D and G), and used a microsaw to select small pieces (~2\u20133\u00a0mm) for age dating to allow control on the microstructure of the dated samples.\n\n4.1\nMethod and 40Ar\/39Ar analytical protocol\nThe sample of the pseudotachylyte from locality B was hand-crushed using an agate pestle and mortar, and one piece (~0.3\u00a0mm) was separated from the crushed material. The sample was packed in an aluminum capsule together with the Taylor Creek Rhyolite (TCR) flux monitor standard along with pure (zero age) K2SO4 and CaF2 salts. Small fragments from the other three exposures (A, D and G) were prepared similarly. The samples were irradiated at IFE (Institutt for Energiteknikk, Kjeller, Norway) in two irradiations. The raw data and the correction factors for the production of isotopes from Ca and K can be found in the supplementary dataset X.X The samples were placed in a 3.5\u00a0mm pit size aluminum sample disk and step heated using a defocused 3.5\u00a0mm laser beam with a flat energy spectrum (Photon Machines Fusions 10.6). The extracted gases from the sample cell were first exposed to a piston free Striling cryochiller held at \u2212130 ?C to trap potential water vapor, then further expanded into a two-stage low volume extraction line (c. 300\u00a0cm3), both stages equipped with SAES GP-50 (st101 alloy) getters, the first running hot (c. 350\u00a0\u00b0C) and the second held at room temperature. Argon isotope compositions were analyzed with an automated MAP 215\u201350 mass spectrometer in static mode, installed at the Geological Survey of Norway. The peaks and baseline (AMU\u00a0=\u00a036.2) were determined during peak hopping for 10 cycles (15 integrations per cycle, 30 integrations on mass 36Ar) on the different masses (41\u221235Ar) on a Balzers electron multiplier (SEV 217) and regressed back to zero inlet time. Samples C1A (1 and 2), D1B (3) and T1B (4) were analyzed on a SC 217 multiplier from MasCom. Blanks were analyzed every third measurement. After blank correction, a correction for mass fractionation, 37Ar and 39Ar decay and neutron-induced interference reactions produced in the reactor was undertaken using in-house software AgeMonster, written by M. Ganer\u00f8d. This software implements the equations of McDougall and Harrison (1999) and the newly proposed decay constant for 4\u00a0K after Renne et al. (2011). A40Ar\/36Ar ratio of 298.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31 from Lee et al. (2006) was used for the atmospheric argon correction and mass discrimination calculation using a power law distribution. We calculated J-values relative to an age of 28.608\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.033\u00a0Ma (\u00b1\u03c3) for the TCR sanidine flux monitor (Renne et al., 2011). Uncertainties are quoted at the 95% confidence level.\n\n\n4.2\nResults\nLaser step heating results of the pseudotachylyte sample CdC14-20 from locality B are presented in Fig. 8a and Table 1\n. The step heating experiment yielded a weighted mean plateau age of 50.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23\u00a0Ma in the middle of the spectrum (Fig. 8a), accounting for 50.7% cumulative 39Ar released, separated by older step ages at low and high temperatures of the experiment.\nAs mentioned above, we have supplemented our 40Ar\/39Ar study of sample CdC14-20 with dating of pseudotachylyte samples from different localities along the shear zone (Fig. 1, exposures A, D and G, see also Figs. 9 and 10\n\n) and, together with sample CdC14-20 (Fig. 8a), the degassing spectra of these analyses are shown in Fig. 8b\u2013e with corresponding age vs. Ca\/K (calculated from 37ArCa\/39ArK) plots. It should be noted that due to a detector error, some of the samples (C1A (1 and 2), D1B (3) and T1B (4)) were run after a long time since irradiation, making results less reliable since most of the 37Ar produced from Ca has been decayed, precluding accurate calculation of Ca\/K ratios and interference corrections. Except for sample T1A, all samples yield reproducible concordant segments, with early Eocene (Ypresian- Lutetian) ages. The apparent age vs. Ca\/K ratios (Fig. 8a\u2013e) diagrams clearly indicate that within-sample concordant steps, yielding early Eocene ages, come from mineral phase(s) with low Ca\/K ratios, generally \u22640.5, which is compatible with degassing of matrix minerals, as reported for other natural pseudotachylytes (e.g., Zanchetta et al., 2011; Di Vincenzo et al., 2013, 2019). Results from sample T1A reported in Table 1 have been considered unreliable, possibly due to recoil effects or, more likely, to the presence of a higher portion of unmelted material from the source rock.\nAside that sample, however, our geochronological results clearly indicate that the Jurassic ductile shear fabric became overprinted by pseudotachylyte structures during the early Eocene. This calls for seismogenic reactivation along the intensely foliated, hence highly anisotropic shear zone structure during the Alpine orogeny.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nAside from our aim to document the pseudotachylyte structures and microstructures developed along the cala Culler\u00f3-Cala Fredosa shear zone, a first crucial aspect concerns the question whether or not the pseudotachylyte fault and injection veins result from frictional heating during coseismic motion along the pertinent fault surfaces. Secondly, the kinematics of the pseudotachylytes should be consistent with the history of Alpine shortening and strike-slip motion in the Pyrenean domain. Finally, the kinematic data, the size of the outcrop, and the thickness of the fault veins allow rough estimates of the associated earthquake source parameters and related energy budget. We now discuss these three aspects below.\n\n5.1\nEvidence for melting during coseismic frictional heating\n\nSibson and Toy (2006) list several criteria that pseudotachylytes should meet to possibly represent melt products of frictional heating. At the outcrop and hand specimen scale, these include fault vein - injection vein geometries, markedly sharp boundaries of the veins with the host rock, a zonal colour banding possibly reflecting chilled margins, no grains visible with naked eye in matrix, embayed clasts, and a glassy luster and\/or conchoidal fracture surface of the veins. At the microscale, criteria such as embayed clasts, microcrystallites\/spherulites, variation of microcrystallite texture at vein margins, dendritic crystal habits, sulphide droplets, and the microstructure of injection veins may all indicate the former existence of a melt. A convincing argument in favour of a former melt phase is the presence of glass, but in geologically non-recent pseudotachylytes such glasses may well have devitrified and recrystallized.\nThe pseudotachylyte exposures at Cap de Creus are characterized by fault and injection veins of cryptocrystalline material, by the markedly sharp boundaries of the dark-coloured veins and, occasionally, a glassy luster and conchoidal fracture surfaces. These features all suggest that the exposed pseudotachylyte material did indeed form from a melt. At the microscale, embayed clasts and occasional millimetre-scale isoclinal folds seem consistent with flow of an essentially fluid (liquid) phase, and this also applies to the shape preferred orientation of tiny clasts such as in Fig. 4b that could have developed during flow of a matrix melt. The most convincing evidence, however, is the clearly igneous, microporphyritic microstructure of the pseudotachylyte matrix at the 10 ?m scale and smaller, seen in at least two of the dated pseudotachylytes from the Cala Cullar\u00f3 peninsula, and made up of non-oriented biotite and feldspar and enclosing ultrafine clasts of quartz. The mineral composition of this matrix is also consistent with the essentially pelitic composition of the sheared protolith as follows. As emphasized by Spray (2010), the development of frictional melts is a nonequilibrium process involving initial cataclastic grain size reduction, comminution and subsequent melting, affecting first the low hardness sheet silicates with rather low individual melting points, followed by harder feldspars with higher melting points, and eventually leaving quartz as clasts. The country rock minerals thus melt in a sequence controlled by their mechanical properties and individual melting points. Given the phyllosilicate-rich composition of the mylonitic country rock, a more ferromagnesian, biotite-rich melt can be expected which, owing to its low viscosity, has an enhanced potential to act as a lubricant. All of the observational evidence from the pseudotachylyte structures and microstructures in the Cala Cullar\u00f3 \u2013 Cala Fredosa shear zone thus seem consistent with the former presence of a melt phase in fault and injection veins, presumably generated during coseismic frictional melting.\n\n\n5.2\nKinematics of the pseudotachylytes in the context of the Alpine orogeny\nWe now turn to the tectonic setting of the pseudotchylyte-forming process during Alpine reactivation. The orientation data for the ductile and pseudotachylyte structures are summarized in Fig. 11a and b. Note that the ductile stretching direction is subhorizontal on a NE dipping shear plane (Fig. 11a), and that the lineations on fault veins have similar orientations (Fig. 11b). Kinematic criteria consistently indicate subhorizontal ductile shearing with a dextral, top-to-the-SE sense of motion, whilst the movement direction of the pseudotachylyte is subhorizontal but with an opposite, top-to-the-NW sense (Fig. 11b). The Variscan basement rocks of Cap de Creus form part of the Iberian margin presently preserved south of the North Pyrenean Fault (Fig. 11c). The Iberian margin was affected by Alpine continental collision of Iberia and Eurasia from the latest Cretaceous till the Miocene. The collisional process resulted in a minimum cumulative shortening of some 165\u00a0km, evidenced from restoration of the deep seismic ECORS Pyrenees section (Beaumont et al., 2000), during which time the original Jurassic shear zones, and the attenuated Variscan metamorphic field gradient, became likely tilted northwards by ~90\u00b0 towards their modern orientation (Vissers et al., 2017). Whilst the net shortening direction is approximately N\u2013S, plate kinematic reconstructions (Vissers and Meijer, 2012) show that the shortening direction varied considerably with time. The well-confined early Eocene (Ypresian-Lutetian) ages of the pseudotachylytes (between 52.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.64\u00a0Ma and 44.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0Ma, see Table 1), allow interpretation of the associated brittle strike-slip deformation against the background of Iberian plate kinematics. Based on ocean floor magnetic anomaly fitting in a six-plate circuit, Euler poles for Iberia with respect to Europe for anomaly (chron) An24 (53.3015\u00a0Ma) and An21 (46.536\u00a0Ma) describe the positions of Iberia shortly before and during the main stages of pseudotachylyte development (Figs. 10 and 11c). From this reconstruction, and using the stage pole describing the motion of Iberia from chron 24 to chron 21, an average shortening direction can be calculated trending WNW-ESE, i.e., clearly different from the cumulative NS directed shortening of the Pyrenees, but remarkably consistent with brittle reactivation along a NW-trending shear zone and development of pseudotachylyte fault veins with top-to-the-NW kinematics (Fig. 11c).\n\n\n5.3\nEarthquake source parameters and energy density allied with the fault veins\n\n5.3.1\nSeismic moment\nWith the notion that the pseudotachylyte fault veins at Cap de Creus may have formed in response to coseismic faulting, the displacements (~25 and 40\u00a0cm) needed to form the duplex structure at locality D should be a measure of coseismic slip. We note, however, that it is unclear if the pseudotachylyte fault veins all developed during one single event, or if these different slips represent different earthquakes. We also note that the observed displacements are not necessarily equal to the mean values of coseismic slip.\nThe mapped outcrop of the pseudotachylyte-bearing shear zone is 1500\u00a0m long, and at both ends the structure likely continues below sea level. Together with the slip values, we may estimate the associated earthquake magnitude because both the dimensions of the fault and the slip value are parameters contributing to the seismic moment (Mo):\n\n(1)\n\n\nMo\n=\n\u03bcA\n\n\nD\n\u203e\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere ? is the shear modulus, A the rupture surface and \n\n\nD\n\u203e\n\n\n the average displacement (slip) along the fault. A lower bound to the rupture surface A can be estimated via the exposed length of the pseudotachylyte bearing shear zone assuming a circular slipped area of ?r2 representing a reasonable minimum value of A with a radius r\u00a0=\u00a0750\u00a0m. For an average displacement of 0.25\u00a0m and a shear modulus of 30\u00a0GPa, Mo\u00a0=\u00a01.32\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 Nm, yielding a moment magnitude Mw of 4.75 (Hanks and Kanamori, 1979). For a slip value of 0.40\u00a0m, Mo\u00a0=\u00a02.12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 Nm, which is equivalent to Mw\u00a0=\u00a04.88.\n\n\n5.3.2\nFault vein thickness, shear resistance and energy dissipation\nThe observed fault vein thicknesses in the Cap de Creus pseudotachylytes allow estimates of the average shear resistance during slip \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n via the energy dissipated to form the melt layers by coseismic frictional melting. Such analysis by Di Toro et al. (2005) and Sibson and Toy (2006) shows that for adiabatic melting from frictional dissipation the thickness t of the melt layer can be approximated by:\n\n(2)\n\nt\n=\nQ\n\/\n\n\u03c1E\nm\n\n\nwhere\n\nQ\n=\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\nF\n\nD\n\nand\n\n\nE\nm\n\n=\n\nc\np\n\n\n\n\nT\nm\n\n\u2212\n\nT\na\n\n\n\n+\n\u0394\n\nh\nfus\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nQ\n\n is the frictional heat generated per unit area of the fault, \n\n\u03c1\n\n the rock density, and \n\n\n\nE\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n the energy per unit mass needed to melt the host rock. \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n is the average shear resistance during slip, \n\nD\n\n the coseismic displacement, whilst the parameters to calculate \n\n\n\nE\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n are \n\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\n\n the specific heat, \n\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n the melting temperature, \n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n\n the ambient host rock temperature at the onset of slip, \n\n\u0394\n\n\nh\n\n\nfus\n\n\n\n the latent heat of fusion, and \n\n\u03d5\n\n the proportion of unmelted clasts. From equation (2) it follows that (see also Di Toro et al., 2005):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n=\nt\n\n\n\u03c1E\n\n\nm\n\n\n\/\nD\n\n\n\nwhilst the energy dissipation per unit area of a fault surface to form a frictional melt layer of thickness t is:\n\n(4)\n\n\nQ\n=\n\n\nt\u03c1E\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFault vein thicknesses observed at Cap de Creus are between 1 and 4\u00a0mm, and often vary even on the outcrop scale. Fig. 9a shows vein thicknesses in 11 exposures along the host shear zone, measured using field photographs and thin sections. The average of the mean values per exposure (white dots) along the shear zone is ~2\u00a0mm. We therefore estimate the average shear resistance \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n associated with 2\u00a0mm thick fault veins for coseismic displacements D\u00a0=\u00a00.25\u00a0m and D\u00a0=\u00a00.40\u00a0m. Apart from fault vein thickness and displacement values, \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n is also a function of \n\n\n\nE\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n and therefore of host rock temperature prior to slip which, unfortunately, is poorly constrained. In view of the Jurassic 40Ar\/39Ar age of the host shear zone, Ta must have been below the 40Ar\/39Ar closure temperature for muscovite (~350\u00a0\u00b0C). Exhumation studies in the central Pyrenees (e.g, Sinclair et al., 2005) indicate ongoing erosion of the Axial Zone already in the Early Eocene suggesting that also at Cap de Creus ambient temperatures may have been substantially lower than 350\u00a0\u00b0C in response to erosional exhumation of the thickening crust, although the 40Ar\/39Ar white mica age of 58.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.55 from another ductile shear zone in Cap de Creus (Vissers et al., 2017) indicates that those sheared rocks may still have been at lower greenschist-facies conditions. We therefore explore \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n for ambient host rock temperatures \n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n\n of 100 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C, and use \n\n\u03c1\n\n\u00a0=\u00a02650\u00a0kg\/m3, cp\u00a0=\u00a01200\u00a0J\/kg\u00b0C, a melting temperature of 1200\u00a0\u00b0C, \u0394hfus\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0kJ\/kg, and ?\u00a0=\u00a00.2. Our choice for the value of cp is corroborated by the average composition of the host shear zone rocks, whilst the pseudotachylyte microstructures indicate that a proportion \n\n\u03d5\n\n\u00a0=\u00a00.2 of clasts in the matrix is reasonable. For a 2\u00a0mm melt layer, the average shear resistance \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n calculated for 0.25\u00a0m slip and \n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n=\n\n 100\u00a0\u00b0C is 36.5\u00a0MPa, whilst \n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n=\n\n 300\u00a0\u00b0C yields 31.4\u00a0MPa. For 0.4\u00a0m slip, these values are 22.8 and 19.6\u00a0MPa, respectively. The associated energy dissipation is 9.1\u00a0MJ\/m2 for \n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0\u00b0C, and 7.8\u00a0MJ\/m2 for \n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0\u00b0C. Like Sibson and Toy (2006) we find that the energy dissipation on a fault surface to form melt layers 1 and 10\u00a0mm thick is ~4.5 and ~45\u00a0MJ\/m2.\nBearing in mind that the kinematics of the fault veins at Cap de Creus indicate brittle strike-slip reactivation of a moderately to steeply dipping anisotropic shear zone, we infer that the fault veins are best described as strike-slip structures. We therefore use estimates of the depth-dependent frictional shear strength on optimally oriented faults by Sibson and Toy (2006) for the case of strike-slip faulting, but also explore normal and thrust faults. Note that the temperature increase during melting (\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n\n) is also depth-dependent because the ambient host rock temperature \n\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n\n increases with depth along the geotherm, hence that (\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n\n) decreases with increasing depth. It follows that, for each of the main Andersonian fault types, a given fault vein thickness also serves to model the coeval depth of the fault zone. Like Sibson and Toy (2006) we make the assumption that ?F drops linearly to zero during slip, so that the average kinetic resistance is half the initial static frictional strength, and perform our calculations for a dry crust, i.e., for zero pore fluid pressure. Note again that the depths at which melt veins of a given thickness are expected to form vary with Andersonian fault type (Fig. 9b). For a strike slip fault, 2\u00a0mm thick fault veins are inferred to form at a depth of ~4\u00a0km, but note that any pore fluid pressure would result in larger depth values hence that the inferred depth must be considered a minimum value.\n\n\n5.3.3\nEnergy dissipation and apparent stress estimates from seismology\nThe estimated energy dissipation for 1, 2, and 10\u00a0mm melt layers is shown in the diagram of Fig. 12\n modified after Sibson and Toy (2006). This allows comparison with seismological estimates of earthquake fracture energy ranging from 0.1 to 10\u00a0MJ\/m2 (Abercrombie and Rice, 2005) shown in grey shading. The diagonal shear stress contours define combinations of slip and average frictional resistance that could give rise to melt layers of different thickness. As noted by Sibson and Toy (2006), they also represent contours of apparent stress relating radiated wave energy per unit area of the fault to displacement. Apparent stress (Wyss and Brune, 1968) of an earthquake (the product of seismic efficiency, \u03b7, and the average shear stress over the fault surface during slip, \n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n? is defined as:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\n\n\n=\n\n(\n\u03b7\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\u03bc\n\n(\n\n\nE\n\n\nr\n\n\n\/\nMo\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere Er is the radiated wave energy, Mo the seismic moment, and \u03bc the shear modulus. As \n\nMO\n=\n\u03bc\nA\n\n\nD\n\u203e\n\n\n\n (equation (1)), this can be rewritten as:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\na\n\n\n=\n\n\nE\n\n\nr\n\n\n\/\n\n(\nA\n\n\nD\n\u203e\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nso that apparent stress is the wave energy radiated per square meter of the fault surface, per meter displacement. Values for apparent stress commonly lie in the range 0.1\u20131\u00a0MPa, equivalent to 0.1\u20131\u00a0MJ\/m2 of radiated wave energy per meter displacement (P\u00e9rez-Campos and Beroza, 2001), with an apparent upper limit for continental earthquakes at 10\u00a0MPa (McGarr and Fletcher, 2003). From the diagram of Fig. 12 it is clear that 1\u201310\u00a0mm pseudotachylyte melt layers would require seismic displacements of centimeters to decimeters when \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n ~100\u00a0MPa, in comparison with displacements of decimeters to meters when \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n ~10\u00a0MPa. Choy and Boatwright (1995), however, have shown that the apparent stress of strike-slip earthquakes is significantly higher, with a mean value of 3.62\u00a0MPa and a 95% geometric spread between 0.61 and 20.69\u00a0MPa, which may be pertinent to the case of the Cap de Creus pseudotachylytes indicating subhorizontal slip. P\u00e9rez-Campos and Beroza (2001) also conclude that the apparent stresses of strike-slip earthquakes are larger than those of normal and thrust faults, but smaller than those estimated by Choy and Boatwright (1995). The apparent stress values for strike-slip earthquakes of Choy and Boatwright (1995) are shown in Fig. 12 (red shading). The displacements of 0.25\u20130.40\u00a0m and the energy density for 1\u20132\u00a0mm fault veins define a rectangular field that overlaps with the high 95% boundary of Choy and Boatwright (1995), whilst a 2\u00a0mm fault vein formed at 0.40\u00a0m slip requires \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\u203e\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a022.8\u00a0MPa, i.e. slightly larger than the upper 95% boundary of 20.69\u00a0MPa. A seismogenic origin of the Cap de Creus pseudotachylytes seems thus in reasonable agreement with studies of strike-slip earthquakes in seismology.\n\n\n5.3.4\nEarthquake source parameters and geological constraints\nOur calculations suggest that the pseudotachylytes may have formed in response to one or more strike-slip earthquakes at a minimum depth of ~4\u00a0km, with a seismic moment in the range of 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 to 2.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 Nm (Mw\u00a0~\u00a04.7\u20134.9), and an average frictional resistance of ~23\u00a0MPa. This raises the question what the coeval overburden was now removed by erosion. The thickness of the Paleozoic sequence and possibly overlying Mesozoic and lower Cenozoic rocks is difficult to estimate. Casti\u00f1eiras et al. (2008) describe an upper Proterozoic - lower Paleozoic stratigraphy at Cap de Creus of 2600\u00a0m, at nearby Roc de Frausa of 4260\u00a0m and, farther to the west at Canigou, of 4550\u00a0m. The Mesozoic is not exposed in the easternmost Pyrenees, but Verg\u00e9s et al. (1995) document a Mesozoic-Paleocene succession in the eastern Pyrenees of 3000\u20135000\u00a0m. The total overburden at Cap de Creus may thus have been about 8\u00a0km, but the present day geology only accounts for some 2.5\u00a0km of upper Proterozoic - lower Paleozoic metasediments and Variscan granitoids (Carreras, 2001) because Alpine uplift and erosion removed much of the Paleozoic and possibly Mesozoic rocks. However, the thickness of these rocks in the nearby areas to the west suggests that during the Cenozoic an overburden of more than 4\u00a0km as inferred in our calculations is reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nA greenschist facies shear zone transecting amphibolite-facies metasediments and associated pegmatites at the Cap de Creus peninsula contains pseudotachylytes characterized by up to 4\u00a0mm thick fault veins and cm-scale high-angle injection veins. Microstructural study of the pseudotachylyte reveals ultrafine-grained domains (down to a few micrometers) of biotite and feldspar with a clearly igneous, microporphyritic structure suggesting crystallization from a melt. This observation lends support to an interpretation of the pseudotachylytes as the product of coseismic frictional melting.\nRecent 40Ar\/39Ar dating of the shear zone rocks have revealed a Jurassic (~162\u00a0Ma) age for the mylonites. Here we present results of an 40Ar\/39Ar study of the pseudotachylytes yielding Early Eocene (Alpine) ages between 52.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.64\u00a0Ma and 44.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0Ma. In addition, albeit surrounded with some uncertainties, the kinematics of the pseudotachylyte structures suggest a top-to-the-NW sense of motion, i.e. opposite to the sense of shear in the surrounding shear zone rocks. Both the geometry and kinematics of the pseudotachylytes and their age suggest seismogenic brittle reactivation of the earlier shear zone structure during the Alpine orogeny. Reactivation likely post-dated tilting of Jurassic low-angle normal shearzones, and involved brittle strike-slip motions. This fits well with a coeval stage of strike-slip motion between Iberia and Europe inferred from magnetic anomaly-based plate kinematic reconstructions.\nThe dimensions of the pseudotachylyte-bearing shear zone and estimates of the displacement of 0.25\u20130.40\u00a0m along the fault veins point to minimum values of the associated seismic moment Mo of 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 to 2.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 Nm, equivalent with a moment magnitude Mw of ~4.7\u20134.9. The average thickness of the fault veins is ~2\u00a0mm, and given their strike-slip kinematics this suggests that they may have formed at 4\u00a0km depth, at an energy density of ~9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0J\/m2 and an average frictional resistance of ~23\u00a0MPa, i.e. slightly higher than the apparent stresses of strike-slip earthquakes documented in seismological studies.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nReinoud L.M.

                 Understanding the genetic complexity of traits is an important objective of small grain temperate cereals yield and adaptation improvements. Bi-parental quantitative trait loci (QTL) linkage mapping is a powerful method to identify genetic regions that co-segregate in the trait of interest within the research population. However, recently, association or linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) became an approach for unraveling the molecular genetic basis underlying the natural phenotypic variation. Many causative allele(s)\/loci have been identified using the power of this approach which had not been detected in QTL mapping populations. In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), GWAS has been successfully applied to define the causative allele(s)\/loci which can be used in the breeding crop for adaptation and yield improvement. This promising approach represents a tremendous step forward in genetic analysis and undoubtedly proved it is a valuable tool in the identification of candidate genes. In this review, we describe the recently used approach for genetic analyses (linkage mapping or association mapping), and then provide the basic genetic and statistical concepts of GWAS, and subsequently highlight the genetic discoveries using GWAS. The review explained how the candidate gene(s) can be detected using state-of-art bioinformatic tools.\n               ","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"\n                  Human dentin, as an important calcified tissue in the body, plays significant roles in withstanding masticatory forces and has a complex hierarchical organization. Understanding the composition and ultrastructure of dentin is critical for elucidating mechanisms of biomineralization under healthy and pathological states. Here, atomic force microscope infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and AFM-based amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM) techniques were utilized to detect the heterogeneity in chemical composition and mechanical properties between peritubular and intertubular dentin at the nanoscale. AFM-IR spectra collected from peritubular and intertubular dentin contained similar vibrational bands in the amide regions (I, II and III), suggesting that collagen may exist in both structures. A distinctive band at 1336\u00a0cm\u22121 indicative of SO stretching vibrations was detected only in peritubular dentin. AFM-IR imaging showed an uneven distribution of chemical components at different locations, confirming the heterogeneity of dentin. The Young\u2019s modulus of peritubular dentin was higher, and was associated to a higher mineral content. This study demonstrated distinctive chemical and mechanical properties of peritubular dentin, implying the different development and mineralization processes between peritubular and intertubular dentin. AFM-IR is useful to provide compositional information on the heterogeneity of human dentin, helping to understand the mineral deposition mechanisms of dentin.\n               ","48":"\n                  Gender-based pharmacokinetics and\/or pharmacodynamics differences can result in differences in treatment which can accordingly affect the drug safety and\/or efficacy. A new validated bio-analytical LC-MS\/MS method was developed for the estimation of ezogabine, a third-generation antiepileptic drug, in human plasma using oxcarbazepine as an internal standard (IS) and to study the gender effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters in Egyptian human subjects. Liquid-liquid extraction of plasma samples was performed with diethyl ether: dichloromethane. The separation was accomplished in an isocratic mode with a mobile phase of a mixture of 5\u00a0mM ammonium acetate: methanol: acetonitrile pumped on a reversed phase C18 INERTSIL ODS-3 (5\u00a0\u00b5m, 150\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.6\u00a0mm). Multiple reaction monitoring was applied and operated by positive mode electrospray ionization. Male and female Cmax (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0308; CL\u00a0=\u00a095) and t1\/2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0301; CL\u00a0=\u00a095) were found to be significantly different using Mann-Whitney U test. These findings highlight the difference of ezogabine pharmacokinetics among populations. Further, gender-based ezogabine dose adjustment may be considered.\n               ","49":"\n                  Far infrared radiation (FIR) has been widely used to treat chronic diseases and symptoms; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. As gut microbiota (GM) markedly impact the host\u2019s physiology, making GM a potential target for the therapeutic evaluation of FIR. C57BL\/6J mice were exposed to five times of 2\u00a0min-FIR exposure on the abdomen, with a two-hour interval of each exposure within one day. Fecal samples were collected on day one and day 25 after the FIR\/control treatment, and the extracted fecal DNAs were evaluated using ERIC-PCR and 16S amplicon sequencing. Host\u2019s G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) were analyzed using qRT-PCR. FIR induced immediate changes in the GM composition. A prompt and significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduction in the abundance of phylum Deferribacteres (comprised of several pathogens) was observed in the FIR-irradiated mice compared to the control group. Contrarily, FIR exposure induced beneficial genera such as Alistipes, Barnesiella, and Prevotella. The gut of FIR-irradiated mice was predominated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producers. Also, FIR stimulated the expression of SCFAs-sensing receptors, GPCR 41, 43, and 109 in the gut epithelial barrier. These findings provide the first-hand evidence in which the beneficial effects of FIR radiation might be partially through the modulation of GM.\n               ","50":"\n                  The Arabian camel is the largest known mammal that can survive in severe hot climatic conditions. We provide the molecular explanation for the thermotolerance of camel granulosa somatic cells after exposure to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 2 (acute heat shock) or 20\u00a0h (chronic heat shock). The common features of the cellular responses to acute heat stress were the increase of heat shock proteins and DNA repair enzymes expression. Actin polymerization and Rho signaling were critically activated as a cellular defense against heat shock. Cells exposed to chronic heat shock showed altered cell architecture with a decrease in total detected proteins, metabolic enzymes, and cytoskeletal protein expression. Treatment with transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) pathway inhibitor SB-431542 suppressed the morphological alterations of cells exposed to chronic heat shock. Moreover, during the recovery stage at 38\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, proteomic changes were partially restored with an exponential increase in HSP70 expression, and the cells restored their normal cellular morphology on the 9th day of recovery. Full proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012159. The strategies of cellular defense and tolerance to both thermal conditions reflect the flexible adaptability of camel somatic cells to conserve life under extremely hot conditions.\n               ","51":"\n                  Histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs) play important roles in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation. Recently, it has been suggested that combinatorial modification codes that comprise two or more HPTMs can recruit readers of HPTMs, performing complex regulation of gene expression. However, the characterization of the multiplex interactions remains challenging, especially for the molecular network of histone PTMs, readers and binding complexes. Here, we developed an integrated method that combines a peptide library, affinity enrichment, mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics analysis for the identification of the interaction between HPTMs and their binding proteins. Five tandem-domain-reader proteins (BPTF, CBP, TAF1, TRIM24 and TRIM33) were designed and prepared as the enriched probes, and a group of histone peptides with multiple PTMs were synthesized as the target peptide library. First, the domain probes were used to pull down the PTM peptides from the library, and then the resulting product was characterized by MS. The binding interactions between PTM peptides and domains were further validated and measured by isothermal titration calorimetry analysis (ITC). Meanwhile, the binding proteins were enriched by domain probes and identified by HPLC-MS\/MS. The interaction network of histone PTMs-readers-binding complexes was finally analyzed via informatics tools. Our results showed that the integrated approach combining MS analysis with ITC assay enables us to understand the interaction between the combinatorial HPTMs and reading domains. The identified network of \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d provided potential clues to reveal HPTM functions and their regulatory mechanisms.\n               ","52":"\n                  The calcium looping process, based on the reversible reaction between CaCO3 and CaO, is recently attracting a great deal of interest as a promising thermochemical energy storage system to be integrated in Concentrated Solar Power plants (CaL-CSP). The main drawbacks of the system are the incomplete conversion of CaO and its sintering-induced deactivation. In this work, the influence of particle size in these deactivation mechanisms has been assessed by performing experimental multicycle tests using standard limestone particles of well-defined and narrow particle size distributions. The results indicate that CaO multicycle conversion benefits from the use of small particles mainly when the calcination is carried out in helium at low temperature. Yet, the enhancement is only significant for particles below 15\u202f\u03bcm. On the other hand, the strong sintering induced by calcining in CO2 at high temperatures makes particle size much less relevant for the multicycle performance. Finally, SEM imaging reveals that the mechanism responsible for the loss of activity is mainly pore-plugging when calcination is performed in helium, whereas extensive loss of surface area due to sintering is responsible for the deactivation when calcination is carried out in CO2 at high temperature.\n               ","53":"\n                  Flax fiber (Linen fiber), a valuable and inexpensive material was used as sorbent material in the uptake of uranium ion for the safe disposal of liquid effluent.

The removal efficiency reached 94.50% at pH 4, 1.2\u202fg adsorbent dose and 100\u202fmin in batch technique. Adsorption results were fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm. The recovery of U (VI) to form yellow cake was investigated by precipitation using NH4OH (33%). The results show that flax fibers are an acceptable sorbent for the removal and recovery of U (VI) from liquid effluents of low and high initial concentrations.

Via first principles, in this study, a synthesized CsCl type binary alloy, TiOs, was predicted to be a TNLS with three topological nodal lines (TNLs) centered at the X point in the kx\/y\/z\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c0 plane, and these TNLs, which are protected by mirror, time reversal (T) and spatial inversion (P) symmetries, are perpendicular to one another. The exotic drum-head-like (DHL) surface states can be clearly observed inside and outside the crossing points (CPs) in the bulk system. The CPs, TNLs, and DHL surface states of TiOs are very robust under the influences of uniform strain, electron doping, and hole doping. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced gaps can be found in this TiOs system when the SOC is taken into consideration. When the SOC is involved, surface Dirac cones can be found in this system, indicating that the topological properties are still maintained. Similar to TiOs, ZrOs and HfOs alloys are TNLSs under the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof method. The CPs and the TNLs in both alloys disappear, however, under the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof method. It is hoped that the DHL surface property in TiOs can be detected by surface sensitive probes in the near future.\n               ","55":"\n                  \n                     Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is difficult to treat, especially when the corneal deep stroma is involved. Intrastromal injection of antimicrobial agents is an effective adjuvant therapy for deep recalcitrant microbial keratitis; however, it has not been used to treat AK due to suspected drug toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of corneal intrastromal injection of polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and propamidine isethionate (Brolene\u00ae, Sanofi) in New Zealand white rabbits. We performed intrastromal injections of PHMB (0.02 or 0.01%) and propamidine isethionate (0.1 or 0.05%) into the rabbits\u2019 right corneas. The left corneas were injected with phosphate-buffered saline as controls. The rabbits were sacrificed on the 7th day after injection, and the corneal buttons were harvested for further evaluation by slit lamp microscopy, specular microscopy, hematoxylin and eosin staining, scanning electron microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling assays, and WST-1 assays. We found that intrastromal injection of 0.02% PHMB or 0.1% propamidine isethionate resulted in corneal epithelial erosion, corneal edema, and severe neovascularization. However, 0.01% PHMB or 0.05% propamidine isethionate did not induce obvious cornea toxicity. In conclusion, intrastromal injection of 0.01% PHMB or 0.05% propamidine isethionate may be promising adjunctive treatments for deep stromal AK.\n               ","56":"\n                  Circulatory microRNAs have recently emerged as non-invasive and effective biomarkers for diagnosis of various diseases.

This study aimed at investigating plasma miR-484, miR-524, miR-615-5p and miR-628-3p expression signatures in Egyptian patients with HCV mediated cirrhosis, fibrosis and HCC. Plasma miRNAs expressions in 168 samples [(40 healthy controls, 47 with HCV liver fibrosis, 40 with HCV-cirrhosis and 41 with HCV-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)] were quantified using RT-PCR. The studied miRNAs were differentially expressed among all participating groups. Plasma miR-484 levels exhibited significant downregulation in advanced fibrosis as compared to mild fibrosis and HCC. Moreover, miR-484 showed significant upregulation in HCC versus cirrhosis. Both miR-524-5p and miR-615-5p were upregulated in cirrhotic group as compared to controls. Differential expression between HCC and controls was noticeable in miR-524-5p. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed promising diagnostic performance for miR-484 in discriminating late fibrosis from both mild fibrosis and HCC and also for miR-524 in distinguishing between cirrhosis and fibrosis.

A pulsed power generator (Chundoong) was used to generate pulsed HPMs (dominant frequency: 3.5\u00a0GHz). For treatment 1, 5, 15, and 45 shots are given to cells in which the electromagnetic energy of 0.6\u00a0J was delivered to the cells at each trigger shot. Cell viability, proliferation rate, apoptosis, cell death, metabolic activity, and oxygen-free radical regulation were evaluated after the MW exposure at low and high doses. MW exposure increased the viabilities and proliferation rates of both melanoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, while no significant effects on the fibroblast cells were observed. We found an elevated level of ATP and mitochondrial activity in melanoma cells. Also, it was observed that MW exposure did not affect cell death in melanoma and fibroblast cells. A polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the MWs induced dose-dependent proliferation markers without affecting the cell cycle and apoptotic genes in the melanoma cells. Our findings show the differential effects of the MW radiation on the melanoma cells, compared to those on the fibroblast cells.\n               ","59":"\n                  An optimization-simulation strategy has been applied by coupling a commercial process simulator (Aspen HYSYS\u00ae) with a programming tool (MATLAB\u00ae) to produce a precise steady state simulation-based optimization of a whole green-field saturated gas plant as a real case study. The plant has more than 100-components and comprises interacting three-phase fractionation towers, pumps, compressors and exchangers. The literature predominantly uses this coupling to optimize individual units at small scales, while paying more attention to optimizing discrete design decisions. However, bridging the gap to scalable continuous design variables is indispensable for industry. The strategy adopted is a merge between sensitivity analysis and constrained bounding of the variables along with stochastic optimization algorithms from MATLAB\u00ae such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. The benefits and shortcomings of each optimization technique have been investigated in terms of defined inputs, performance, and finally the elapsed time for such highly complex case study. Although, both GA and PSO were satisfactory for the optimization, the GA provided greater confidence in optimization with wider ranges of constrained bounds. The implemented strategy precisely reached the best operating conditions, within the range covered, by minimizing the total annual cost while maintaining at least 92% butane recovery as a process guarantee for the whole plant. The optimization-simulation strategy applied in the current work is recommended to be used in brownfields to optimize the operating conditions since they are susceptible to continuous changes in feedstock conditions.\n               ","60":"\n                  In this paper, we reported a system for the ultrasensitive fluorescence detection of cytokeratin fragment antigen 21\u20131 DNA (CYFRA21-1 DNA) for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. The approach used electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET-ATRP) with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the metal ligand. Firstly, thiolated peptide nucleic acid (PNA) was linked to aminated magnetic beads solutions (MBs) by a cross-linking agent and then hybridized with CYFRA21-1 DNA (tDNA). Subsequently, Zr4+ was introduced into the MBs by conjugating with the phosphate group of tDNA, and the initiator of ARGET-ATRP was introduced into via phosphate-Zr4+-carboxylate chemistry. Next, Cu(II)Br\/EDTA was reduced to Cu(I)\/EDTA by ascorbic acid (AA) to trigger ARGET-ATRP and then a large amount of fluorescein-o-acrylate (FA) molecules were grafted from the surface of the MBs, which amplified significantly the fluorescent signal.

Placental-specific 8 (PLAC8), which has increased expression in stool, may be associated with CRC recurrence. Insights into the role of PLAC8 in CRC recurrence and its clinical significance may support to develop strategies for preventing CRC recurrence and deterioration. Clinical tissues, cell and animal models were used to clarify the roles of PLAC8 in CRC tumorigenesis, invasion, and migration. Next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA has been used to assess the gut microbiota in stool of CRC patients. We found that PLAC8 was upregulated in tissues from patients with late-stage CRC. In our in vitro studies, PLAC8 was dynamically regulated in mitotic cells. Overexpressed PLAC8 was nucleated at the centrosome during mitosis, and therefore, PLAC8 overexpression might increase cell growth and migration (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The tumorigenic and invasive effects of PLAC8 on CRC cells were also confirmed in a xenograft mouse model. We further identified reduced levels of two butyrate-producing organisms, Butyricicoccus and Prevotella spp., in stools from CRC patients. We found that butyrate downregulated PLAC8 expression and induced apoptosis in PLAC8-overexpressing cells. Our data suggests that PLAC8 gene and protein expression and dysbiosis of gut microflora, especially in butyrate-producing microorganisms, may be indicators of CRC progression.\n               ","62":"\n                  Bergapten has long been used in combination with ultraviolet A irradiation to treat depigmentation disorder.

Subsequently, a high-activity mutant was used to produce bergapten for pharmacological-activity analysis. Key PpBMT amino acids involved in bergaptol binding and substrate specificity were identified, such as Asp226, Asp246, Ser265, and Val320. Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analysis revealed that the V320I mutant efficiently transformed bergaptol to produce bergapten. Pharmacological-activity analysis indicated that bergapten positively affected hair pigmentation in mice and improved pigmentation levels in zebrafish embryos. This report provides the first description of the catalytic mechanism of coumarins-specific O-methyltransferase. The high-activity V320I mutant protein could be used in metabolic engineering to produce bergapten in order to treat depigmentation disorder.

Sixteen male competitive swimmers with 22.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.84\u202fyears of age were randomly assigned in a crossover manner to undergo a standard warm-up (non-PAP; control condition) and a warm-up that included PAP sets (PAP; experimental condition) consisting in 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 repetitions of unloaded countermovement jump. Participants performed a 25\u202fm all-out trial in front-crawl with only flutter kicks eight min after each warm-up. Kinetics (i.e., peak thrust, mean thrust, and thrust-time integral) and kinematics (i.e., speed, speed fluctuation and kicking frequency) were experimentally collected by an in-house customized system composed of differential pressure sensors, speedo-meter, and underwater camera. Peak thrust (P\u202f=\u202f0.02, d\u202f=\u202f0.66) and mean thrust (P\u202f=\u202f0.10, d\u202f=\u202f0.40) were increased by 15% in PAP compared to non-PAP. Large and significant differences were noted in speed (P\u202f=\u202f0.01, d\u202f=\u202f0.54) and speed fluctuation (P\u202f=\u202f0.02, d\u202f=\u202f0.58), which improved by 10% in PAP compared with non-PAP.

Data were acquired through surveys published between 2006 and 2018 from the Demographic and Health Program in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Multiple logistic regression was used for each national survey to identify the associations between WS conditions and malaria infection diagnosed by microscopy or a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) among children (0\u201359\u202fmonths), with adjustments for age, gender, indoor residual spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated net (ITN) use, house quality, and the mother\u2019s highest educational level.

Therefore, highly sensitive readout parameters are necessary to adequately quantify distress. The present study compared the performance of different non-invasive methods in determining animal distress, such as measuring body weight, distress score, faecal corticosterone metabolites, burrowing, and nesting behaviour, with continuous monitoring of heart rate, body temperature and activity by telemetry. The distress caused by two surgical interventions was compared and the burden caused by tumour growth was described. Transmitter implantation caused higher distress than laparotomy plus carcinoma cell injection into the pancreas. Surprisingly, no significant increase in distress was observed during tumour growth. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that some non-invasive distress-parameters, i.e., distress-score and burrowing activity, exhibited slightly better performance to quantify distress than the most suitable parameters measured by telemetry. Due to the high burden caused by the implantation of the telemetric device, the use of non-invasive methods to assess distress in laboratory animals after surgical interventions should be favoured in future studies.\n               ","67":"\n                  To investigate the H2 purification mechanism of V membranes, we studied the adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion properties of H in V, an attractive candidate for H2 separation materials.

As the coverage range increases, the adsorption energy of H2 molecules first decreases and then increases, while that of H atoms remains unchanged.

Specifically, lower body positive pressure support system (LBPPSS) decreases weight-bearing and ground reaction forces with potentially positive effects on qualitative gait indices. However, which gait features are being shaped by LBPPSS in post-stroke patients is yet poorly predictable. A pilot study on the effects of LBPPSS on qualitative and quantitative gait indices was carried out in patients with hemiparesis due to stroke in the chronic phase. Fifty patients, who suffered from a first, single, ischemic, supra-tentorial stroke that occurred at least 6\u202fmonths before study inclusion, were enrolled in the study. They were provided with 24 daily sessions of gait training using either the AlterG device or conventional treadmill gait training (TGT). These patients were compared with 25 age-matched healthy controls (HC), who were provided with the same amount of AlterG. Qualitative and quantitative gait features, including Functional Ambulation Categories, gait cycle features, and muscle activation patterns were analyzed before and after the training. It was found that AlterG provided the patients with higher quantitative but not qualitative gait features, as compared to TGT. In particular, AlterG specifically shaped muscle activation phases and gait cycle features in patients, whereas it increased only overall muscle activation in HC. These data suggest that treadmill gait training equipped with LBPPSS specifically targets the gait features that are abnormal in chronic post-stroke patients. It is hypothesizable that the specificity of AlterG effects may depend on a selective reshape of gait rhythmogenesis elaborated by the locomotor spinal circuits receiving a deteriorated corticospinal drive. Even though further studies are warranted to clarify the role of treadmills equipped with LBPPSS in gait training of chronic post-stroke patients, the knowledge of the exact gait pattern during weight-relief is potentially useful to plan patient-tailored locomotor training.\n

variation is a valuable and sustainable resource of the phenotypic and genetic diversity within plant species (e.g. barley, Hordeum vulgare L.) worldwide that offer beneficial traits for plant breeding. The phenotypic variation within-species caused by spontaneously natural genetic mutations that maintained in nature by evolutionary, artificial and natural selection processes [1]. Natural variation brought great advances to understand crop morphology and their response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The understanding of natural variation in crop plants through thousands of years for domestication e.g. in barley about 10,000\u202fyears ago [2] can be seen in the genetic modification of developmental traits and adaptive features. Natural variation studies in wild species elucidated the molecular basis of phenotypic differences related to domesticated plant adaptation that is important to interpret the maintenance and evolutionary significance of phenotypic variation [3]. For instance, Six-rowed 1 (VRS1) and Non-brittle rachis 1 (btr1) or Non-brittle rachis 2 (btr2) genes in barley have clear impact on spike architecture phenotype as a consequence of domestication [4,5]. During domestication, loss of function in VRS1 gene converted the two-rowed barley to six-rowed that increased the grain number per spike and the deletions in Btr genes make non-brittle rachis that improved grain retention. Analyses of natural variation within wild and\/or domesticated, cultivated plants diversity can help to utilize the diverse resources for crop improvement efficiently and improve the knowledge of the genetic basis of cultivated crop improvement. Genetic analyses of natural quantitative variation in crop plants were developed a few decades ago [1]. A genebank provides a rich source of genetic variation that had been greatly used to improve cultivars through incorporating the desired alleles into breeding programs for increasing grain yield and improving tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses [6]. The genetic bottlenecks that happened during domestication and modern breeding processes lead to a narrowing of the genetic variation in cultivars that negatively affects productivity, adaptation and yield sustainability [6].\nBarley is grown in areas where other close relative cereal crops like wheat (Triticum spp.) are poorly adapted and it is now cultivated in all temperate regions of the world. Therefore, barley became a basic crop for human civilization and approximately 70% of production is used for animal feed, 20\u201325% malting, and 5\u201310% for food [7]. Presently, it is ranked as the fourth most important cereal crop in the world [8] while Europe and the Russian Federation produce 65% of global production. Being related to wheat and with it is economic and agronomic importance, numerous genetic and genomics studies in barley have been used as a model crop for wheat. Barley's research has dramatically expanded in the last few decades with more than 25,000 publications since 1980 based on Web of Science\u2122. Barley has many features of a model species. Since barley has over 400,000 accessions in gene banks [9], it offers an excellent resource to efficiently exploit genetic resources and their utility for breeding programs. In combination with a new ordered high-quality reference genome sequence assembly [10], barley became a crop with a much more tractable genome. Consequently, barley remains an important model plant that can be used to understand the genetic basis of adaptation to various abiotic and biotic stresses (predicted with climate change).\nThe recent advances in DNA sequencing paved the way to genetically improve the important traits (grain quality, biotic and biotic stress tolerance, etc). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) e.g. genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) provide thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) covering the most genomic region in barley chromosomes. Many powerful statistical genetics methods were proposed to identify alleles controlling target traits. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is one of those useful methods and it is successfully used to identify candidate genes for many important traits in barley as it tests the association between the marker type (e.g SNP) and the phenotype of a target trait. There are many considerations and recommendations that should be taken into account when geneticists decide to perform GWAS. In the current review, we will discuss the advantages and distances of GWAS, different methods for performing GWAS, and a brief guide of interpreting GWAS results. We focused on barley studies in our review as a excellent example of a crop that has a significant genetic improvement due to the identification of many useful QTLs and genes, that were used in marker-assisted selection, using GWAS.\n\n\nGenetic studies of complex traits\nForward genetics aims to screen the phenotype of many individuals that are genotypically different. Understanding the relationship between genetic polymorphism and the phenotypic variation observed among individuals is one of the fundamental interests. This basic relationship has been extensively studied since Mendel demonstrated that this relationship is inherited. Revealing the genetic factors underlying complex characters such as agronomically important traits like grain yield requires an understanding of allelic variation at a specific locus level that controls the phenotype and the genetic architecture of a given trait. The variation of the plant phenotype is directly connected back to the underlying causative loci using mapping approaches. To achieve this goal, phenotypic and genotypic differences among the individuals are studied either using bi-parental QTL mapping populations (linkage mapping) or association mapping populations (LD mapping) of unrelated individuals. Therefore, both mapping approaches aim to identify molecular markers that are linked to QTL.\nThese approaches became attractive and useful because they utilize the advances in genome sequencing and high-quality and density SNP arrays for many crops, including barley. Recently through NGS, most of the populations are genotyped by either a 9\u202fK iSelect Illumina Infinium array [11] that contains 7,842 gene-based SNPs of which 6,094 SNPs have known physical positions (the location of identifiable landmarks of SNP on the chromosome which always measured in base pairs), or a 50\u202fk Illumina Infinium iSelect genotyping array contains 44,040 SNPs which represent 29,415 unique gene pseudomolecules annotations [12]. The 50\u202fK array increased the density of the high-quality markers i.e. a higher number of SNPs (14,626 SNPs) compared with 4,570 SNPs in 9\u202fK [13]. The NGS offers an effective and relatively low-cost approach to rapidly map the population using GBS. The GBS technique uses restriction enzymes to reduce the complexity of DNA samples and then produce high-quality polymorphism data [14]. Early use of GBS found 1,596 SNPs [15], hence the 50\u202fK chip provided better coverage of the genome. Even though genotyping using SNP is extremely efficient and reliable, the GWAS performed over the past decade explored some drawbacks that should be considered. GWAS based on SNP relies on the pre-existing genetic variant reference that is used for sequencing and mapping the individuals. Such specific design leads to missing pinpoint causal variants and cannot detect most of the genetic signals or rare mutations of complex traits. Based on the Web of Science\u2122 database, since 1991 around 1300 QTL studies using parental populations are listed compared to only 90 GWAS publications in barley.\nIn the next sections, QTL mapping and GWAS methods will be discussed with more focus on the GWAS method.\n\n\nQTL mapping (linkage mapping)\nThe linkage or QTL mapping approach is commonly used to identify genomic regions (QTL) controlling target traits. The family-based mapping analysis depends upon the genetic recombination and segregation during the construction of mapping populations in the progenies of bi-parental crosses that consequently affect the genetic mapping resolution and allele richness. QTL mapping has proved and remains a powerful approach to identify loci that co-segregate with the trait of interest in the research population. This approach can be applied in different types of populations e.g. F2 populations, double-haploid (DH) populations, backcross, or recombinant inbred lines (RILs) families, using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR), and SNP markers.\nQTL analysis has been widely applied in barley for the genetic dissection of agronomic traits using genetic maps constructed from RFLP markers [16,17] or applying other genetic maps using e.g. SSRs [18]. QTL analysis for developmental and yield traits was carried out in DH and RIL mapping population using AFLP [19] while SSR markers were used to detect QTL for physiological, biochemical, agronomic and yield traits in RIL population [20,21]. Recently, SNP chip started to be used in QTL studies e.g. Huang et al. [22] used them in a RIL population to discover QTL for agronomic traits and fusarium head blight. GBS is also used for QTL analysis in RIL that allowed them the detection of the Breviaristatum-e (ari-e) locus [15].\nMultiple environment trials (i.e. locations and\/or years) for studying complex traits are commonly used to assess the performance of genotypes across a range of environments, including QTL\u202f\u00d7\u202fenvironment interaction (QEI) to find important and broadly adapted QTL. There are several studies focused on agronomic traits such as heading date, thousand-grain weight (TGW) and plant height in barley using this approach e.g. [23,24]. Many QTL studies have been carried out to study the genetic factors underlying drought-related traits in barley, revealing that most of the detected QTL control developmental and adaptive traits in addition to drought tolerance. Rollins et al. [25] detected numerous QTL under dryland conditions using SSR and diversity arrays technology (DArT)-markers for constructing a genetic linkage map in the RIL population. Using such a combination of markers, QTL analysis demonstrated that heading date related-genes (in particular the vernalization genes Vrn-H1 and Vrn-H2) had pleiotropic effects on yield-related traits and biomass.\nThe major fundamental limitations in QTL mapping are that the diversity of segregating alleles between the parents can be only tested, and the mapping resolution solely relies on the number of recombination events that occurs during the population development [26]. Developing pure lines (homozygous lines) for mapping populations is time-consuming and results in a low resolution of mapped QTL as an outcome of a low number of recombinations caused by the few numbers of genotypes resulting in a narrow genetic base with low allele richness (\nTable1\n\n). Through conventional breeding, six to eight generations of introgressions or selfing are needed to form pure lines (homozygous lines) of RILs or near-isogenic lines (NILs) populations while two generations to form a DH population with a lower chance of recombination rate events than RIL population [27]. This may be due to the fact that DH lines only go through one round of recombination while RILs, on the other hand, go through many rounds of recombination. Homozygous lines can be also produced from F2 using a single seed descent method where one seed is harvested from each F2 line and then grown into an F3 and so on until F8 to F10 generations with high levels of homozygosity at virtually all loci. Finally, the members of a family-based mapping population will contain different amounts of recombination among loci.\nTo avoid these limitations, improvement in the mapping resolution within the mapping population can be dramatically improved by increasing the number of intercrosses using multiparent RILs [28]. There are many positive features in using this approach. It requires high-density markers in case of a high recombination rate (RIL lines) for mapping QTL and to identify tightly linked markers. It is also robust to understand the heterogeneity at the locus level. Advanced molecular technologies e.g. GBS allowed for rapid and cost-effective genotyping (hundred to thousands of markers) with high allele richness that make QTL mapping robust and useful for identifying the target region of complex traits.\n\n\nGenome-wide association study (GWAS)\nAssociation analysis using GWAS is a powerful tool being effectively and efficiently used for genome-phenotype associations and causative loci\/genes identification. The basic scenario in GWAS is to calculate the association between each marker and a phenotype of interest that has been scored across unrelated lines\/individuals (unrelated individuals means distantly related and heterogeneous individuals) of a diverse collection [29]. Robustness and effectiveness of GWAS in the dissection of complex traits in crops including barley had been demonstrated and expected to become more efficient to identify the causative loci\/gene(s) for quantitative traits with a help of the currently available large populations and high-throughput sequencing technology. High-resolution mapping can also be attributed to historical recombination events [30] and the greater allele numbers that are incorporated in GWAS. In the association mapping populations, historical recombinations that accumulated over generations with historical Linkage Disequilibrium (LD, over dozens\/hundreds of generations) persist among the representative accessions and improved the resolution for association analysis through the rapid decay of LD. Unlike association mapping populations, family-based populations, particularly DH populations, having a limited number of recombination events will often generate populations with relatively low mapping resolution and wide recombination value for a pair of loci, hence a larger linkage block that increases LD.\nThe application of sophisticated analytical approaches has started to extend the utility of different genetic resources for studying the natural variation that can be ultimately used in improving the crop. This approach has been studied extensively in humans and also started in plants since the beginning of this century [31]. Early reports used this approach in plants were on diverse maize (Zea mays L.) population [32] and Arabidopsis\n[33], thereafter the approach was used in other crops and the number of published reports increased, see the review by Rafalski [30]. In barley, this approach started ten-years ago [34,35].\nRecently, GWAS has become a key approach for mapping quantitative traits and studying the natural variation. GWAS with high-density genotyping platforms provides enough marker density to dissect the genetic architecture of traits of interest in barley. Through screening large and diverse collections with ample genetic marker density, GWAS can detect causal loci underlying natural phenotypic variation. For instance, GWAS analysis using a 9\u202fk SNPs chip from Illumina\nTM\n\n[11], a gene-based chip providing a high genetic resolution that can help to uncover novel alleles that improve productivity and adaptation. In barley, the GWAS approach will become more robust and informative using the newly developed 50\u202fk Illumina Infinium iSelect genotyping array for barley [12].\nNatural variation of phase transition especially heading date is one of the critical traits that are highly associated with adaptation and yield [36]. Understanding the natural variation of heading date is important to increase our knowledge regarding the natural diversity of other developmental traits such as leaf area, plant height, tillering, grain number, or other agronomic traits [37\u201342].\nThe main objectives of performing GWAS are to identify causative factors for a given trait and\/or to determine the genetic architecture of the trait. The number of loci underlying the phenotypic variation of traits differs i.e. the trait can have a simple genetic architecture with a low number of large-effect loci (e.g. barley spot blotch) or a complex genetic architecture and controlled by many loci (polygenetic e.g. heading date) [43].\n\nImportant factors affecting the power of GWAS\nThe power of GWAS to detect the true association is determined by many factors which should be taken into account when geneticists and breeders perform GWAS for target traits, Table1 summarized the advantages and limitation of GWAS which are described as follow:\nFirst: phenotypic variation. The raw phenotypic data should be filtered from the outliers which are noisy data points for further analysis. Keeping these points can shift the phenotypic data from a normal distribution which is considered as a limitation of GWAS that can later affect the natural diversity analysis. The simple way to know how many outliers are in the phenotypic data and whether they are effective or not is to use a boxplot that can easily visualize the data and extreme outliers should be excluded. Meanwhile, the phenotypic variation is an important part of the association analysis and removing outliers should not affect it in a meaningful manner. Moreover, traits only with moderate to high heritability estimates (for the phenotypic data after filtration) should be considered in GWAS because heritability is a good indicator of how much the genetic variance contributed to the phenotype and how much the phenotype is linked to the genotype. Low broad-sense heritability is a limiting factor that reduced the power of GWAS to detect the association. Genotypes repeated across locations or years may have a strong genotype\u202f\u00d7\u202fenvironment interaction which reduces the heritability of a trait. There are many methods such as best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) and best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) that can be used to adjust the phenotypic data scored across locations or years to provide better estimates of the phenotypic values considering genotype\u202f\u00d7\u202fenvironment interaction. The relationship between the associated SNP and phenotypic traits in unrelated individuals is explained by the estimation of the variance of SNPs which when used in a GWAS is also known as the so-called SNP-based heritability. Such analysis helps in dissecting genetic variation and understanding the genetic architecture for complex traits, in addition to identifying the most significant SNP that can be incorporated in future breeding programs.\nSecond: the number of individuals. The population size is very important for obtaining meaningful results. Population size is critical to define portions of the phenotypic and genotypic variation; hence increasing the population size will improve the power of having meaningful associations with a larger effect, an acceptable frequency within the population, and overcome rare-variants. Thus, a low number of individuals is a disadvantage that reducing the power of GWAS. A range of 100\u2013500 individuals are needed and suitable for performing GWAS [44]. The individuals of the population may be selected based upon their expected phenotypic and genotypic variation considering genetic background, including geographic regions, biological status, growth habit or whatever trait the researchers interested in. The selected individuals should be replicated to confirm their diversity through statistical analyses including clustering analyses and to ensure a normal distribution. In case the individuals do not have extensive genotypic information, it is possible to estimate their genetic diversity using a few molecular markers for some important genes e.g. photoperiod response, vernalization response, plant height, and row-type. After a phenotypic and genetic analysis, we keep those individuals which show high variation in the population. Finally, sufficient seed for further research purposes is needed. The population should be grown and isolated (selfing) for at least one growing season with a preference for multiple selfing generations for multiplication and purity e.g. single seed descent. Careful selection of population individuals can have large genetic variation and detect true novel association signals that can be used for further breeding and genetics aspects. Most of barley GWAS studies used hundreds of individuals which were selected to represent different geographical regions, growth habits, row-types, etc. which maximize the genetic variance to detect the specific allele(s). This approach also increased the chance for genetic heterogeneity within the population that may reduce the power of GWAS to detect major loci, leading to a non-causative allele(s), and affect the allele estimates of the marker. A high number of samples with low genetic heterogeneity (from the same region, growth habit or row-type\u2026) may not show expected phenotypic\/genotypic diversity or the allelic variation present at low allele frequency or absent completely. Therefore, a high number of globally diverse individuals would be the best solution to make the balance between genetic diversity and allele frequency e.g. GWAS for highly heritable and routinely scored morphological traits during genebank propagation (e.g. row-type, hull adherence and awn roughness) in a 1,000-sample core set from 21,405 accessions of the IPK barley collection using GBS [45]. Many studies on wheat dealt with the problem of heterozygous loci in the association panel by considering all heterozygous loci as missing and re-filtering the marker data [46,47] and similarly was done in faba bean, Vicia faba L [48].\nThird: population structure. It is a statistical approach that aims to calculate relatedness correlation among individuals within the population due to the admixture and historical structure that must be considered carefully during the analyses and results interpretation. The selection of a population for association analysis by researchers generates the structure, based on geographic or growth habit, etc. that leads to having a specific genetic variation and an effect on the end-use of association analysis. It is the major limitation in the GWAS analysis since not all individuals are equally distantly related to each other at the genetic level. Ignoring the correction of population structure leads to having spurious associations between genotype and the trait of interest. The STRUCTURE program is a computationally intensive method to define the population structure and then estimate the proportion of clusters (unknown number of subpopulations) within the population so-called Q matrix and then estimates which individual belongs to which subpopulation [49]. The software produces highly accurate clustering using multilocus data from the genotypes to explain the population structure. Removing structured associations is not always adequate for controlling the population structure due to the limitation in defining the number of clusters and how to assign individuals into clusters. In addition, structure analysis can be time-consuming requiring intensive computational analysis. Alternatively, the EIGENSTRAT method using principal component analysis (PCA) is another statistical approach developed by Price et al. [50] that counts the structure of the population in order to reduce the dimensional genotype data to control the structure. The method considers the genotypic data to deduce genetic variation that can be explained by a small number of dimensions. Yu et al. [51] developed a mixed-model approach to control spurious associations through accounting multiple levels of relatedness through a pairwise relatedness matrix called the kinship matrix (K). K can calculate the relatedness between pairs of individuals using genotypic information. The high value of relationships among the individuals indicates high genetic similarity e.g. the tendency among the individuals from the same geographical region which can be clustered in the group. Most of the studies use both methods (STRUCTURE and PCA) to confirm their results [38,45,52,53]. The principal component analysis is presented in a scatter plot of PCA1 and PCA2 which present the most of the total variation between the individuals based on their genotypic data. If the genotypes are randomly distributed in the plot and form no clear groups, then there is no population structure in the population, and vice versa (Fig. 1\n\na and b). In STRUCTURE software, the population structure is determined by plotting the proposed number of subpopulations against delta k\n[54]. However, if the number of subgroups is assigned into two subpopulations, the population could have two possible subpopulations or no population structure because STRUCTURE does not estimate delta k for the first subpopulation. The presence or absence of population structure can be determined by another plot in which a number of subpopulations are plotted against log-likelihood. In the case of no population structure (Fig. 1\nc), the log-likelihood is steadily increased with the increase of a number of subpopulations. If the log-likelihood, on the other hand, is steadily increased after k\u202f=\u202f2 (Fig. 1\nd), then this population can be divided into two possible subpopulations. Structure Harvester (http:\/\/taylor0.biology.ucla.edu\/structureHarvester\/) is a very useful website in which the output results of STRUCTURE can be compressed and uploaded. The software provided information on population and the best k for the proposed populations in table and figures.\nFourth: allele frequency. A very important factor, which affects the power of GWAS, is if alleles are present in a few individuals across the population. Rare allele leads to a lack of resolution power [55]. Therefore, allele frequency distribution and analysis impact on detecting the association. It is difficult to detect the functional alleles that are present at a low frequency unless they have high impacts on the phenotype. Ignoring the allele frequency might mislead the GWAS outputs. Most of the GWAS studies focused solely on common variants and have the major allele frequency at\u202f\u2265\u202f5%. This approach means that in the population of 200 individuals, the allele present in 10 individuals or less will not be detected because it is a rare variant with minor allele frequency (MAF) at\u202fless than\u202f5%. Unfortunately, rare alleles could explain natural variation in a specific group of individuals that is important for further breeding and genetics in addition to biological studies. For example, deep analysis of GWAS revealed that a group of East Asian accessions (13 accessions out of 209) is carrying the allele (MAF\u202f\u2265\u202f5, i.e. the allele present in 11 accessions) that led to significantly longer phase durations, lower tiller numbers, more leaves, and a greater leaf area [56]. This finding confirmed that low-frequency alleles may have relatively large effects on complex traits and suggested that the population structure should be well studied and connected to the GWAS output to interpret the findings. It is also important to mention that the selection process of individuals has a clear impact on variants across the allele frequency that can be skewed for traits which are strongly influenced by selection. In most crops, the domestication bottleneck has a clear impact on the allele frequency by eliminating many rare alleles and reduced the average allele frequencies. Therefore, careful selection of a large number of representative individuals (including wild relatives and landraces) with advances in genotyping (e.g. GBS) will further boost the power of GWAS to detect the MAF by increasing the number of SNPs. Furthermore, a deep analysis of the association signals including the flanking SNPs and group-specific individuals (e.g. wild and landraces) could, on one hand, increase the power of discovering variants with a strong effect on the phenotype. Alternatively, it could potentially detect the causative association signal. Overall, discovering the highly informative rare alleles will provide more powerful genetic tools to answer biological questions.\nThe linkage mapping population is a good choice for dealing with rare alleles since it can be artificially introduced. Several studies have used linkage mapping along with LD mapping, which resulted in a methodology known as \u201cnested association mapping\u201d which decreases spurious associations by considering the population structure. Recently, Nested Association Mapping (NAM) has been developed in barley to investigate the genetic architecture of complex traits using GWAS. Halle Exotic Barley 25 (HEB-25) is a multi-parental mapping design to use the advantages of linkage analysis and association mapping by crossing 25 wild barley (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum, Hsp, and ssp. agriocrithon, Hag) accessions with the spring barley cultivar Barke (H. v. ssp. vulgare, Hv) which offered an exceptional genetic resource [57]. Allelic diversity within the mapping population can be increased through intercrossing multiple parents which are genetically diverse e.g. the Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) [58]. Another issue that should be considered is allelic heterogeneity at a single locus level (multiple alleles\/genomic markers might have similar effects on the trait of interest), or at loci heterogeneity if the heterogeneity occurs in several distinct genes [59]. Incorporating multiple neighboring markers to the strongest associated signal is the solution in small grain cereal crops e.g. barley and wheat because we still work with a few thousands of SNPs.\nFifth: LD is another point that has to be considered during the analyses, especially to define the interval of highly associated SNPs that can lead to defining the most significant loci. Ignoring the non-random association among alleles at different loci means that both causal and non-causal alleles will be incorporated in the further analyses that likely driving to have false associations. The LD is an indicator to detect the distance between loci, which is important to find the number of required markers for the whole-genome scan, i.e. high LD value means a low number of markers are needed to cover the genome [60,61]. A long-range LD increases the chance of false association and therefore, the calculation of LD at the beginning of the association analysis is essential. The coefficient of LD is used to measure the value of how likely two loci are associated and sharing the history of mutation and recombination. This analysis always includes a disequilibrium matrix that shows the pairwise calculations among loci using the most two common statistics for measuring LD i.e. r2 and D\u2019 [31]. According to many LD analyses in plants, r2 is a stronger value to estimate how loci correlate with the QTL of interest while D\u2019 is more affected by small population sizes and low allele frequencies. Because LD is used to calculate the association value between loci (r2 or D\u2019, >0) it is important to connect the phenotypic variation with the causative SNPs. LD between SNPs, including the causative locus (within LD) must be considered in a statistical analysis that can show whether each SNP within the LD is significantly associated with the phenotypic variation or not. Here, we propose to consider all SNPs above the threshold (in some cases all SNPs) in such analysis to check which one can explain more natural phenotypic variation since it is known that not all of the highly associated SNPs having a highly significant impact on the phenotype. The SNPs which are in LD with r2\u202f>\u202f0.2 should be considered in the statistical analysis which can be useful to detect the causative loci especially for QTL that are located in the centromere region. Another feature of calculated r2 as an estimate of LD between each pair of SNPs is that it gives important information if a group of significant SNPs tends to be inherited together or representing the same QTL or individual QTLs. By looking on the significant SNPs located on the same chromosome, if the r2 value between the two SNPs is high, then these SNPs probably represent the same QTL and tend to be inherited together, while, if the value is low, then the two significant SNPs probably represent two different QTLs.\nTo clarify, LD is an estimate of map distance with the consideration of allele frequencies, whereas linkage refers to chromosome-level [31].\nThe map resolution of a given population (i.e. the number of markers and density) is determined by genome size and LD decay (the rate at which LD declines with genetic or physical distance). How quickly LD decays over distance (genetic\/physical) has been shown to differ dramatically and vary significantly among species, within the genome and for loci within a population. The rapid decay of LD requires a large number of markers to be used in the whole-genome association analysis [62]. The rate of LD decay helps the breeders to point the number of markers that would be needed for GWAS by dividing the genome size on the distance at which LD is decayed [63].\nIn self-pollinated species like barley, the LD decay is always larger than in cross-pollinated species such as maize, therefore a lower number of markers are required to cover the genome. In barley, one million SNP markers are required to cover the barley genome in case of LD decay at 5 kbp, whereas only 57,000 SNPs are required if the decay is at 100\u202fkbp [61]. Moreover, the LD decay varied among different barley populations with less than 1\u202fcentiMorgan\u00a0(cM as a genetic distance based on the genetic linkage for the physical distance of alleles on a chromosome which is equal to the number of recombinants divided by the total number of offspring multiplied by 100) in wild and 14\u202fcM in cultivated winter barley and within the genome, i.e. was higher in the centromeric than telomeric regions [64]. Therefore, high mapping resolution with dense SNPs together with great genetic diversity makes barley a promising model temperate cereal crop. LD decay can be visualized by a scattering or heatmap plots of r2 values versus genetic\/physical distances between all pairs of SNPs along a genome or chromosome or specific genomic region e.g. QTL.\nThe historical recombination can be estimated through analyzing the LD pattern in the population which depends on multiple factors like allele frequency, recombination rate, random mating, mutation rate, genetic drift and migration, selection, population size, and structure. In the association's panel which is selected by researchers (artificial selection process), the allele frequency is not expected to fit with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions for loci (i.e., unlike bi-parental population, genotype frequencies can not be predicted by association population allele frequencies). SNPs that are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are commonly removed from GWAS analysis [65]. The advantage of association population is that recombination events which are accumulated over generations improve the map resolution with high allele numbers. In outcrossing species, the effect of mating patterns and admixture clearly explain more rapidly LD decays compared to selfing species due to the greater effective recombination in outcrossing species [31]. The effects of genetic drift include losing rare alleles that increase LD levels in small population size. Selection can also increase LD. For example, if the mutation or recombination between the neighboring alleles happened then they both will be under selection pressure. Therefore, the selection of the association population can produce locus-specific linked alleles (selected allele at a locus) which control specific phenotype that likely appeared in LD. Generally, selection and admixture increase the LD level. Finally, migration increases LD in the population and has an impact on genetic structure in an association panel. Therefore, estimating a \u201cstructure\u201d in the population or identifying subgroups in the panel can reduce its impact. Ignoring selection, mutation, migration, or drift which could have occurred during the history, lead to having alleles in linkage equilibrium (r2 or D\u2019=0).\nAs discussed above, the major problem of having a false association in GWAS is the population structure. The application of mixed model methods to correct the population structure using the PCA [38] or K matrix [53] in barley is commonly used [36,40,45,66] as a powerful tool for controlling the population structure and reducing spurious signals of association whereas a combination (Q\u202f+\u202fK) of these approaches appears to be the most powerful [11,67]. These approaches have successfully split the individuals of diverse barley populations into subpopulations based upon row-type (two- and six-rowed) and\/or geographical origins and\/or growth habits (spring and winter subpopulations). Therefore, considering the relationship matrix for the population structure correction purpose in the mixed models is an influential method that is commonly used in barley to significantly reduce the number of false-positive associations. Note, in some cases, controlling the population structure using Q\u202f+\u202fK may lead to having overcorrection and then losing significant information and output.\nRecently, many studies used QTL mapping and association mapping to identify and validate QTLs associated with target traits e.g. in maize [68], faba bean [48] and brassica [69]. Two populations representing two different genetic backgrounds of bi-parental and diverse populations which were genotyped using the same set of markers. The advantage of using both populations is the easy tracking of significant markers associated with the same trait in two different genetic backgrounds. There is no study in barley that includes both analyses. Therefore, it could be very useful to consider this approach in barley to genetically improve breeding target traits.\n\n\nHow GWAS works\nTo conduct a GWAS experiment, the first step is to select the population of study with a full consideration of the size of the population (minimum 100 individuals) with preference to increase the number of individuals as much as possible to avoid Beavis effects that lead greatly overestimated of phenotypic variance when the number of individuals are small e.g. 100 [70]. Then, there are three important stages for performing a successful GWAS experiment (\nFig. 2\n\n); Stage I is the phenotyping in which all genotypes should be phenotyped for a particular trait or group of traits based on the objectives of the study. Accurate phenotyping is a very critical point to detect genotype-phenotype associations. Phenotyping should be repeated over replications and\/or locations and\/or years. The broad-sense heritability should be calculated for raw data (note, it should be calculated after removing the outliers) including all of these factors and considering G\u202f\u00d7\u202fE interaction. High heritability is an indicator that the trait is mostly genetically controlled which is important to detect the association signals. Then, the phenotypic data can be used to estimate the mean i.e. BLUE or BLUP. Because the phenotypic data are highly unbalanced in the plants, the estimation of genotypic values is mostly calculated as fixed effects (i.e. BLUE) using mixed models [71] which have been successfully used in barley [45,52,53,66].\nStage II (\nFig. 2\n) is the genotyping in which the same set of individuals that were phenotyped should be used for genotyping using DNA molecular markers. GBS is the most frequent method used in genotyping because it generates numerous SNP markers inexpensively that cover the crop genome (e.g. wheat, barley, etc.). The GBS-generated SNPs should be filtered based on missing data, heterozygosity, and minor allele frequency. Before running GWAS, population structure should be tested in order to select the better GWAS model. The general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM) are statistical models often proposed for performing GWAS (Fig. 2). The GLM does not take the population structure-related into account. Hence, GLM was used in populations which did not have the population structure in faba bean, Vicia faba L. [62] and rice [72]. The MLM, on the other hand, considers the population structure in its model (Kinship or kinship\u202f+\u202fQ matrix + PCAs).\nFinally, the phenotypic and genotypic data are combined using appropriate software (e.g TASSEL) by which alleles associated with a particular trait can be detected after the GWAS model was selected (Stage III: Fig. 2). Phenotyping is highly recommendable to be conducted before genotyping especially for those populations with no prior information. For example, if a population consisted of 400 genotypes which were collected from different regions and the objective is to test them in a particular environment. It is possible that many genotypes could be lost due to poor adaptation to the phenotyping environment. Therefore, time and money (for genotyping) can be saved by testing the phenotypic diversity of that population first.\nThe significance of marker-trait associated (passing the threshold e.g. \u2013log10 p-value 3) is usually determined by the false discovery rate (FDR) or Bonferroni correction (BC) which can be defined as multiple comparisons that can be fit to test the significance of hundreds of thousands to millions of markers in GWAS. For BC, the significant level is divided by the number of tests (markers) at each locus. The BC method is intensively used e.g. [73,74] to define the threshold of significant markers for several traits at once. As a result, a fixed BC P-value will be generated using the following equation\n\n\n\nP\n-\nv\na\nl\nu\ne\n\n\n\n\nB\nC\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n0.05\n\nK\n\n\n\n\nwhere k is the total number of markers (statistical tests).\nThe false discovery rate (FDR) is another test that provides an estimate of the number of actual true results among those called significant [75]. In this test, the p-values of all markers generated from GWAS are sorted in ascending order. Then, each p-value at each locus is given a rank (R - e.g. 1, 2, 3, \u2026. 100,000). The p-value of FDR for each marker is calculated as follow\n\n\n\np\n\nv\na\nl\nu\ne\n\n\n\n\nF\nD\nR\n\n\n\n=\n\n\npR\n\u00d7\n0.05\n\nK\n\n\n\n\nwhere p R refers to the rank of marker p-value\nFDR is calculated for each trait independently, which makes it more powerful in studying the genetic factors of developmental and agronomic traits in crop plants. Compared to the fixed p-value (BC) for all traits, the p-value (FDR) is more flexible and changed based on the markers and traits. Therefore, FDR is less conservative than BC and recommended to be used in crop plant association studies to detect the highly associated markers for each trait independently. In both tests and at each locus, if the p-value of FDR or BC is less or equal to the p-value, generated from GWAS, of the marker, the association is true and the marker is associated with the trait. The marker-trait association can be tested at the significance level of 0.01 and 0.05 [38,53]. However, some association analysis studies tested the marker-trait association by using FDR at 20% of significance level as it can detect significant markers with minor effects [62]. The determination of significance level for marker-trait associations in GWAS is based on the study, which may use high FDR to investigate the whole picture of the genetic architecture of a trait or low FDR to identify candidate loci\/gene(s) for further genetic and molecular studies [39].\n\n\nSoftware for performing\u00a0GWAS (TASSEL, GenStat, PLINK, and R (GAPIT))\nGWAS can be performed using many software statistical packages (Stage III: Fig. 2). Here, we focused on the most important association analysis software packages that are frequently used.\nTASSEL (Trait Analysis by Association, Evolution, and Linkage) is the most common software for GWAS in plants. It includes many powerful statistical methods for performing GWAS including GLM and MLM [76]. TASSEL can analyze the population structure using kinship and PCA . LD is included also in TASSEL. The software is always used in association analysis in barley e.g. [40]. The new version of TASSEL (TASSEL 5.0) can analyze genetic diversity and perform SNP calling from GBS data. Interestingly, the software includes many visualizing tools which can be used to present data such as a scatter plot of PCA, LD, Manhattan plot for GWAS results, the heat map for genetic distance, a phylogenetic tree using archaeoptery in addition to the phenotypic variance explained by markers (R2). The new version also includes some useful data summaries, which provide a quick view for a researcher on genotypes, markers, heterozygous, missing data and number of markers on each chromosome. Old versions of TASSEL such as TASSEL v.2.1 can accept any type of DNA markers (e.g. SNP, SSR, AFLP, RAPD, etc.). The TASSEL v.5.0 accepts only SNP markers. TASSEL is free software and can be downloaded from http:\/\/www.maizegenetics.net\/tassel.\nGenStat for Windows Edition is another statistical software that can perform marker-trait association analysis in a genetically diverse population using bi-allelic and multi-allelic markers. Using GenStat, GWAS can be done either GLM or MLM models with population structure correction to control genetic relatedness by PCA or Kinship. There is an option to define the threshold of the significance of \u2013log10(p) of which Bonferroni can be selected. Interestingly, LD decay can be determined and visualized by GenStat software and the effect of each SNP can also be calculated to show the impact of the SNP on the traits. LD decay is important to determine the number of markers required for GWAS. Plots for GWAS profile of the -log10(P) of the test statistics and the map with the location of the detected significant markers, and Q-Q can also be visualized. Therefore, GenStat has been intensively used to detect causative allele(s)\/loci in barley [11,36,67,77] of which had been cloned (\nTable 2\n\n). The GenStat software can be purchased and downloaded from https:\/\/www.vsni.co.uk\/software\/genstat\/.\nPLINK allows the study of a large dataset of phenotypes and genotypes [78]. It is free software that can be downloaded from http:\/\/zzz.bwh.harvard.edu\/plink\/. It provides many characteristics and features of which, PLINK performs analyses for population stratification detection, basic association tests, meta-analyses, and some other tests such as gene-based tests for association and screening for epistasis. Graphical images for Manhattan plot, Q-Q plot, and multidimensional scaling (for population structure) can be illustrated. Also, the results of GWAS and LD among SNP markers can be presented in tables produced by PLINK.\nThe recent advances in R statistical environment free software (https:\/\/www.r-project.org\/) provide many useful packages for performing GWAS. The genome association and prediction integrated tool (GAPIT) is a useful R package that performs GWAS and genomic selection. The main advantages of GAPIT are: it can handle a large amount of data (SNPs and genotypes) and it reduces computational time without compromising statistical power [79]. The package includes many statistical methods such as MLM, population parameters previously determined (P3D), and efficient mixed-model association (EMMA). The results of GWAS results can be illustrated by Manhattan plots, quantile\u2013quantile (QQ) plots and a table, including p-value, minor allele frequency, sample size, phenotypic variance explained by markers R2 and adjusted P-value following a false discovery rate [75]. Similarly, the results of kinship are presented in a heat map and a table. Moreover, heritability estimates and likelihood function can be produced in graphs at different compression levels. Due to the aforementioned features, GAPIT becomes the most powerful and useful tool for association analysis in barley [41,45] or other cereals like wheat [80].\nThere is a clear trend of using GenStat for QTL and candidate-gene identification because it is one of the earliest software to do these analyses and has many features that are not available in other software. For example, by GenStat the phenotypic and genotypic data can be analyzed, BLUE values can be calculated, LD can be measured, and population structure with PCA and kinship can also be calculated and then GWAS by applying either GLM or MLM can be done. The output includes all of the important plots and information about the marker-trait associations e.g. the effect value of marker on the trait in addition to G\u202f\u00d7\u202fE interaction. Finally, the significant associations can be validated by Bonferroni correction. In other software\/packages, often each step needs to be calculated separately for GWAS.\n\n\nThe output results of GWAS\nEach software program gives slightly different parameters as output results for GWAS. TASSEL software is a good example of producing many parameters that help to dissect the genetic basis of the target trait. These parameters include the p-value of each SNP which is important to determine the significance with the trait, R2 (phenotypic variation explained by marker) that determines if the significant SNP is a minor or major QTL, and allele effects of the significant SNP (increased or decreased the trait).\nThe main output can be presented in the Manhattan plot that illustrates, on a genomic scale, the P-values of all markers used in GWAS. The x-axis represents the genomic order by chromosome and position on the chromosome, while, the y-axis represents the\u202f\u2212\u202flog10 of the P-value of each marker (equivalent to the number of zeros after the decimal point plus one). The associated significant SNP (lowest significant p-values), representing QTL tend to show up as a strong signal on the Manhattan plot (Fig. 3\n\nA). The threshold of \u2013log10 (p-value) can be fixed at a confidence value of which \u2013log10\u202f\u2265\u202f3 is the most common and reliable value (Fig. 3\nA). For further analysis, the threshold can be recalculated using the multiple comparison analysis that makes the p-value of SNP more robust and trustworthy (Fig. 3\nA).\nAnother important graph in GWAS is the QQ plot which illustrates the relationship between the observed and expected p-values. It depicts the deviation of the observed P-value of each SNP from the null hypothesis. The QQ plot can be used to compare the observed vs, expected values among GWAS statically models to show how well the model used in GWAS considering the population structure and familial relatedness and then can be applied, for instance, MLM compared to GLM or CMLM models (Fig. 3\nB). The diagonal or standard line (red in Fig. 3\nB) shows whether the points are matched perfectly or deviated which reflect the distribution. Gray area shows 95% confidence region for values. It is expected that most of the data points in the QQ plot will lie on the diagonal line since they are not associated with the trait. Whereas the deviations from this line suggest that the model does not sufficiently control the population structure which can be interpreted as spurious associations.\nThere are three main possible QQ plots, each with its own meaning:\n\n(1)\nthe observed values correspond to the expected values, all points (observed vs. expected p-values) are very near or on the diagonal line and within the confidence interval, the gray highlighted region (Fig. 3\nB).\n\n\n(2)\nthe significant SNPs (observed p-values are highly and significantly different from expected p-values under the null hypothesis) move towards the y-axis (Fig. 3\nB).\n\n\n\n(3)\nIf there is an early separation of the points or unclear trend, this means that the results could be due to an unaddressed population structure or\/and poorer quality of the phenotypic data. In this case, most of the highly deviated SNPs are represented as a false association and other considerations (e.g. correction of population structure, phenotypic data correction) are required (Fig. 3\nB).\n\n\n\nIt is implausible that GWAS will completely explain the heritable proportion of complex traits, but, it can explain a large proportion. The difficulty in detecting small effects by rare variants or very small effects by common alleles makes it impossible.\n\n\n\nGWAS as a driver of gene discovery in barley\nIn barley, progress has recently been made toward identifying loci\/genes underlying the phenotypic and allelic variation of complex traits using GWAS with a high throughput SNP platform, i.e. sufficient marker density to cover the entire genome. Many studies have demonstrated the power of association population mapping in identifying candidate genes that control the target traits (\nFig. 4\n\n). Here, we will also demonstrate the power of GWAS in detecting the allelic variation which had been functionally validated (\nTable 2\n).\n\nANTHOCYANINLESS 2 (ANT2) is the first gene in barley discovered using GWAS and then cloned by Cockram et al. [67]. Re-sequencing ANT2 candidate basic helix-loop-helixprotein1 (HvbHLH1) gene showed the deletion in a premature stop codon upstream that lead to lack of anthocyanin in the tested mapping population. Lateral spikelet fertility gene INTERMEDIUM-C (INT-C) is another example. It is an ortholog of the maize domestication gene TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB1) and was detected by GWAS [81]. The natural allelic variation at this locus shows the positions of the 17 independent int-c mutant alleles, which is important to understand the genetic basis of crop domestication and fundamental spikelet developmental processes. HvAPETALA2 (HvAP2\/Cly1) had been also detected by GWAS that is associated with the genetic basis of natural variation of spike density-related traits in spring barley [77]. In the same study, the GWAS was used to discover the ZEOCRITON alleles which are associated with the studied traits in a 401 two-rowed UK spring barley population. In 2012 Comadran et al. [11] developed the 9\u202fK iSelect IlluminaTM SNP platform from which they provided a high GWAS map resolution that leads to cloning barley CENTRORADIALIS (HvCEN\/eps2) which contributed to the spring growth habit and environmental adaptation in cultivated barley. Using a GWAS, the genomic region of salt tolerance gene HKT1;5 had been discovered in barley and then re-sequencing the gene that is responsible for Na\u202f+\u202funloading to the xylem and controlling Na\u202f+\u202fdistribution in the shoots validates it [82]. The aforementioned successful examples of genes identified through GWAS provides strong evidence that GWAS served as part of a rapid gene-cloning strategy that can be effectively used for further gene cloning.\n\n\nQTL and allelic variation detected using a GWAS\nGWAS is also used to explore the important alleles of the candidate genes underlying the natural variation (Table 2\nand\nFig. 4). For example, GWAS analysis in a worldwide barley collection discovered the most important alleles of Six-rowed spike 2 (VRS2) gene. Haplotype 4 encodes a functional VRS2 protein showed a significant and consistent association signal for phase duration, leaf area, and leaf and tiller number [56]. The natural variation of the pre-anthesis stages\/phases in barley is based on the genetic allelic diversity at PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR (HvPRR37)\/PHOTOPERIOD RESPONSE LOCUS1 (Ppd-H1) gene, as the central heading time gene, that in turn regulates the responses to long-day photoperiod. A single nucleotide change at marker 22 alleles (G\/T in the CCT-domain) Ppd-H1 gene changes the status of the photoperiod responsive (Ppd-H1) accessions to reduced photoperiod sensitivity (ppd-H1) to long-day conditions. The change led to the evolution of the late heading of European accessions (mostly cultivars\/breeding lines) compared with the early heading of landraces (carrying sensitive alleles Ppd-H1) and coming from the barley center of origin [36,83]. Histological analysis confirmed the GWAS results that allelic variation at marker 22 of Ppd-H1 controlled cell proliferation period and leaf maturation which directly contribute to leaf size in European winter barley [41]. In other studies, GWAS demonstrated that the genotypic variation at the barley domestication gene VRS1 influenced the leaf area and tiller number which was confirmed by mutant, histological, transcriptome and molecular validation in case of leaf area [84]. GWAS showed that natural selection of adaptive evolution for late heading in European accessions improves other adaptation and developmental traits such as increased leaf area and tiller number which in turn improve grain yield [38,39,41]. Many other genes found to be associated with important developmental and agronomic traits (Fig. 4) of which BFL (BARLEY FLORICAULA\/LEAFY) gene had strong associations with phase transitions, tillering and other yield-related traits [36,38].\nGWAS demonstrated its strength to detect novel loci\/QTL of natural variation (Table 3\n). To this end, many barley populations and marker types have been used for studying the genetic basis of wide-range of traits including agronomic traits (Table 3). For example, Genobar world wide spring barley collection consists of 224 accessions had been intensively used for GWAS studies that revealed QTL (\nTable 3\n) for tillering at 5H (31.7\u201334.1 cM) and 6H (16.9\u201324.6), plant height at 5H (21.3\u201324.6) [38], leaf area at 1H (95.9\u201397.9) and 2H (50.9\u201356.4) [39] in addition to many other novel QTL underlying the natural variation of germination, seedling architecture at 1H (76\u201348), 2H (112\u2013115) and 5H (44\u201345) [52], phase transition and developmental stages 3H (56\u201364) and 5H (2.6\u20139.3) [36]. Natural variation analyses in a NAM population (consists of 1420 individuals) were applied that provide further insights into the evolutionary genetics underlying adaptive traits in barley [57,66,73,74]. Using NAM population, the allelic variation at many genes involved in phase transition and development (Vrn-H, Ppd-H, and Denso, Fig. 4) in addition to many other novel loci (\nTable 3\n) at 4H (3\u20134 and 110\u2013114) have been detected [57]. Whereas Saade et al. [73] discovered the locus underlying biodiversity in leaf sheath hairiness at 4H, 111.3\u202fcM using the same population (Table 3). GWAS approach was used to understand the genetic mechanisms of biotic and abiotic stress in barley. For instance, salt and drought stress tolerance alleles\/loci were discovered in different diverse barley populations [52,66,85]. The genetic basis of seedling root and shoot architecture under drought stress had been studied that reveal new loci at 1H (76\u201348), 2H (112\u2013115) and 5H (44\u201345) with the putative candidate genes [52]. In other studies, GWAS had been conducted to explore the genetic factor (Table 3) underlying drought tolerance agronomic traits e.g. grain yield, TGW, peduncle, leaf, and spike length [86] and physiological parameters e.g. water use efficiency and water content among 2H (118\u2013119), 3H (24\u201325), 4H (49\u201355) and 5H (48\u201349 and 147\u2013148) are important [87]. Studies focused on discovering the natural variation of salt tolerance in barley and effective loci at 2H,140\u2013145 [66] and 2H (3.5), 4H (1\u202f4\u202f5) and 5H (43.5) have been detected [88]. Novel loci associated with natural variation of resistance to stripe rust, Fusarium, the net form of net blotch and stem rust [89\u201393] whereas the study by Turuspekov et al. [94] identified highly significant QTL at 6H (63\u201364) for stem rust resistance (Table 3). Nagel et al. [95] used GWAS for the first time to study seed dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting traits and revealed novel loci at 1H (5), 3H (104.3 and 135.6) and5H (169.4). In addition to above-mentioned studies, many others have been conducted to uncover the genetic architecture of yield component and quality traits under field conditions e.g. at 2H (41\u201352\u202fcM), 3H (8\u20139), 5H (100\u2013108) [40], 2H (106\u2013107), 7H (1.6\u201315) [96], 2H (145\u2013155), 3H (95\u2013100) and 5H (160\u2013170) [97]. The GWAS studies in barley detect novel QTL which not previously reported including candidate genes for further genetic and\/or molecular characterization and validation. GWAS output provides new sources of alleles that enhance the diversity of tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress in addition to improving yield in future breeding.\n\n\nHow to predict the gene in barley?\nOnce the GWAS output has passed all of the statistical criteria, the next step will be candidate genes identification. The most important, consistent and significant association(s)\/QTL(s) including highly significantly associated markers (-log10 SNPs passing the multiple comparison analysis e.g. FDR) e.g. genomic region at 7H (Fig. 3\nA) will be selected to find their physical positions using recently published barley genome sequence [98]. The physical map can be used to define the physical interval on the genome (using flanking SNPs of association\/QTL within the LD decay physical distance) that can include candidate gene(s). \nBARLEX\n, IPK server http:\/\/apex.ipk-gatersleben.de\/apex\/f?p=284:10 offers such information about the SNPs and barley genes including their annotation GO Terms and other useful information.\nIn case there are many highly associated SNPs within the LD decay physical distance, we recommend narrowing down the physical interval up to hundred(s) Kbp that empowered us to detect the closest candidate genes to the highly associated SNP. In the best case, SNP(s) can be physically within the candidate gene that leads to checking whether these SNP(s) are functional i.e. having a significant impact on the associated traits or not.\nHere we suggest selecting the high confidence gene including SNPs within their physical position to make \u201c\nSNP-Gene based haplotype analysis\n\u201d that allows us to validate the functionality of the SNP(s) within the candidate gene. This analysis can identify which SNP has the most effect on the associated trait(s) by splitting the population based on the alleles of each SNP. Matching the allele with the phenotypic value in the population and then statistical analysis for the significant differences test between alleles e.g. t-test statistics can show the importance of each allele on the targeted trait(s).\nTogether with the Exome Capture Sequence, data and gene expression available at \nBARLEX\n for barley will allow one to check whether the candidate gene is a capture target and then reveal the most promising haplotypes underlying associated traits, in addition, to check in which organ and at which developmental stage the gene is expressed. This analysis will provide the ability to build phylogenetic-trees and haplotype-networks within and between individuals and subpopulation or genetic background (e.g. geographic region) to provide insights into the evolution of the candidate gene(s), potentially providing evidence for selection in particular regions\/environments. This approach helps further functional and molecular analysis e.g. mutagenesis, expression analysis and CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) (CRISPR)\/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein9). The analysis will validate and provide trait-enhancing alleles for crop breeding\/genetics and shed new light on evolution and functions.\n\n\nGenomics of polyploidy cereals\nPloidy level in crop species is a significant factor influencing the genotyping qualities, SNP discovery, and validation. Many cereal crop species are unlike barley and rye with a diploid genome (2n\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f=\u202f14). The polyploidy genome in cereal crops such as tetraploid (2n\u202f=\u202f4x\u202f=\u202f28) and hexaploid (2n\u202f=\u202f6x\u202f=\u202f42) wheat, tetraploid and hexaploid oats (Avena sativa), and triticale (Triticosecale) that can be tetraploid to octoploid (2n\u202f=\u202f8x\u202f=\u202f56). The genome complexity in the allopolyploid species as results of hybridization of related species e.g. triticale (a cross between wheat (Triticum turgidum) and rye (Secale cereal)) [99] makes genotyping far behind the diploid crop species and slowed down SNP discovery. A notable challenge in polyploid cereals is how to assemble and distinguish the homologous SNPs among the genotypes and subgenomes and\/or paralogous SNPs due to duplicated copies and transposable element. High sequence similarity among the subgenomes impedes discovering the homologous variations which are important for understanding the genetic factor underlying the quantitative traits in polyploid crops. The redundancy of homoeologs among the subgenomes can curb important phenotypic variation. Genetic studies in polyploid cereal crops required high-density, quality and number of SNPs through high-throughput SNP genotyping to overcome on complexity and size of genomes. For instance, SNP arrays achieved noticeable progress in SNP polymorphic rates and size had been developed in wheat 9\u202fK, 90\u202fK, 35\u202fK, 135\u202fK and 820\u202fK SNP [100]. Prior to attempting GWAS in polyploid crops, some important points must be carefully considered, e.g. how to detect and define the rare alleles, to which subgenome the allele belongs and how to deal with the effect of population structure and which subgenome contributes more to the structure and variation in addition to LD and it\u2019s decay. The recent advances in the genome sequence in allopolyploid crops e.g. bread wheat and its diploid and tetraploid progenitors [101\u2013104] help the researchers in distinguishing among homologous copies carried by subgenomes. The new technologies lead to de novo assembly of the chromosomes that reduce the complexity by assembling the highly redundant genome and assign the genes. Sequencing ancestral diploids aid the assigning of specific sequences to the diploid progenitor. The emergence of the pan-genome in crops will improve the sequence coverage and quality. It will lead to develop a core genome that contains all shared sequences in all sequenced individuals and add the absent\/present genes [105].\nIn wheat, the \nWheat@URGI\n (Unit\u00e9 de Recherche G\u00e9nomique Info) databases and tools to discover genetic and genomic wheat data according to \nIWGSC\n reference sequences, physical maps, genetic maps, polymorphisms, genetic resources, phenotypes and arrays [106]. It maintained and hosted by a research unit in genomics and bioinformatics at Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). WheatMine website https:\/\/urgi.versailles.inra.fr\/WheatMine\/begin.do.\nIt is also possible to blast the targeted sequences at the specific chromosome and ancestral diploid using blasting server https:\/\/urgi.versailles.inra.fr\/blast_iwgsc\/blast.php.\nThe output contains the gene description including annotation, GO Terms and other useful information. High-quality reference genomes and gene discovery, using high quality de novo genome assembly improve the GWAS analysis to discover the candidate gene using the physical position of linked SNP markers with the natural variation. Using SNP arrays for genotyping, researchers working on wheat were able to detect candidate genes for grain yield-related traits [46,47,80,107,108].\nEven though promising progress in polyploidy cereals genomics analysis has been made in last few years, most genetic studies in polyploids e.g. wheat have so far relied on diploid models i.e. barley to simplify the polyploid data and overcome of the aforementioned obstacles in wheat. Barley has been a model for genetic and cytogenetic studies in last decades due to many features e.g. low chromosome number, dozens morphological and cytological mutants, thousands of genetic stocks, genetic mutant stocks for reverse genetics approaches e.g. Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) are available. In addition to advances in gene editing e.g. Cas9 and its close evolutionary distance and extensive conservation of synteny, barley is a useful genomic model for wheat and other polyploidy cereals.\n\n\nFuture applications of GWAS strategy in crop improvement\nThe knowledge of natural variation in barley as a model crop for small grain cereals has advanced tremendously in the past years. In the near future, GWAS in barley will be more informative using the advances in the genomic sequence, high-throughput SNP genotyping with the impressive set of genetic resources that are available at the genebank e.g. IPK. The GWAS output can be implemented and used in many aspects, for instance, breeding, genetic mapping, candidate genes, and gene editing. Highly accurate phenotyping by researchers or high- throughput phenotyping platforms will also increase the power of GWAS in detecting novel loci. Such advances provide resources that improve and facilitate breeding, genomic and genetic analysis of important agronomic traits in crops. More deep analysis for the detected causative loci by GWAS e.g. haplotype-based analysis is a key for genomics-assisted crop breeding. GWAS has a higher resolution because of more recombination events, and more genotypes can be used for a broader genetic base compared with biparental QTL mapping. GWAS in future barley work should be considered as an exploratory analysis for the right selection of true segregating parents that can be used in the QTL mapping population and for further genetic and molecular validation of the associations. GWAS can also used to understand breeding-program variation (the genetic variation in the association panel used to develop improved plant material) or marker-assisted selection (selection of individuals for breeding program based on their genotypic information at specific allele linked to QTL) because the association mapping population can be considered as a source of alleles which are not or rarely present in the bi-parental mapping populations.\nRecently, many studies used QTL mapping and association mapping to identify and validate QTL associated with target traits e.g. in maize [68], faba bean [48] and brassica [69]. This approach using both populations to check whether the significant markers associated with the same trait in two different genetic backgrounds or not [109]. There is no study in barley using this approach; therefore, it could be very useful to consider it in barley to genetically improve breeding target traits. The association mapping population is a source of allelic variation including the domestication alleles which are mostly present in wild relatives and landraces offers an excellent resource to increase the discovery of functional loci\/genes underlying genetic variation for complex traits including yield, disease resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance. The analyses allow predicting the function of many alleles representing mutations and candidate genes which have an agronomic impact, hence can be used in further molecular validation e.g. gene expression and gene editing. With the help of statisticians and bioinformaticians, the analysis of complex traits in crops will be much improved through developing more databases and statistical models. Integrating -omics and genetics will be crucial for crop improvement and molecular analyses. The extension of the analysis of natural variation to the molecular mechanism will elucidate the mechanisms involved in barley plant development and adaptation.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"\n\nIntroduction\nDentin, which comprises most of tooth structure, is a mineralized connective tissue with distinctive mechanical properties necessary for supporting enamel, protecting dental pulp and withstanding masticatory forces without fracturing [1,2]. Like other vertebrate mineralized tissues such as dental enamel and bone, the specialized functions of dentin are determined by its hierarchical organization and composition [3]. Dentin is a heterogeneous composite material traversed by dentinal tubules of micrometer diameter (1\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm) and surrounded by mineralized peritubular dentin, which is embedded within a partially mineralized intertubular dentin [4,5]. The dentin tubules extend radially outwards from the pulp toward the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) and cementum-dentin junction (CDJ) [2,5]. The heterogeneity of this human hard tissue makes it difficult to be repaired and reconstructed readily [6]. Clinically, dentin damaged by disease has to be replaced by restorations. Understanding the mechanical and biochemical properties of dentin is the cornerstone to predicting its behavior and its interfacial interactions with restorations [5,7]. Such knowledge will help to reveal the process of mineral deposition, which is important for the development of treatments for mineralization-related diseases (dentinogenesis imperfecta, dental erosion and carious lesions) and also for the innovation and development of scaffolds for its repair.\nDue to the small dimensions of human peritubular dentin (about 1\u00a0\u03bcm in width) and its being contiguous with intertubular dentin [8], the chemical composition and structure of peritubular dentin is still not well understood. FTIR spectroscopy was an excellent tool for analyzing the functional group of organic and inorganic molecules, as well as crystallinity of the mineralized tissue [9\u201315]. The organic and mineral composition of peritubular dentin of horses has been identified using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) [16]. Due to the limited spatial resolution (3\u201330\u00a0\u03bcm) of FTIR, conventional FTIR spectroscopy of human teeth only represents the average spectrum within a beam area consisting of both peritubular and intertubular dentin and fails to distinguish peritubular dentin from intertubular dentin [16\u201318]. AFM-based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) is a new technique which combines the spatial resolution of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with the chemical analysis of infrared spectroscopy (IR) using the AFM probe to detect the changes of photothermal resonance induced by pulsed infrared emissions. The AFM-IR technique can achieve chemical component mapping with high spatial resolution of 20\u201330\u00a0nm, which is also in high consistency with FTIR [17\u201319]. Taking the advantage of the fine spatial resolution and the ability to collect topographical and chemical information simultaneously, AFM-IR technique is the ideal tool for identifying the structural heterogeneity of nanocomposite materials and tissue samples including dentin, bone, skin and hair [20\u201330].\nThe difference in chemical distribution between peritubular and intertubular dentin may induce differences in mechanical properties. Clarifying the mechanical differences between peritubular and intertubular dentin is the corroboration for the chemical difference, as well as an important reference for dental operative procedures. Previous articles have reported the Young\u2019s modulus difference between peritubular and intertubular dentin via techniques such as nanoindentation and AFM-indentation [31,32]. However, the spatial resolution of the above approaches is also limited. Instead, AM-FM mode is a recently developed bimodal AFM technique that provides fast and quantitative maps of Young\u2019s modulus and viscosity coefficients of the sample surface with comparable spatial resolution with AFM-IR mapping [33,34]. In AM-FM mode, the cantilever was excited at two frequencies simultaneously. The first-order resonance was used for tapping mode imaging, which was operated in amplitude modulation (AM). As the tip taps the surface, the second resonance frequency will shift depending on how the tip interacts with the sample. This frequency shift is traced with frequency modulation (FM) and converted into values of the sample\u2019s Young\u2019s modulus. AM-FM mode has been applied to determine elastic modulus of a large variety of materials such as bone microconstituents, cells and polymers [34], which will benefit the study of the differences in mechanical properties between peritubular and intertubular dentin.\nThis is the first study to identify the nanoscale chemical heterogeneity of human dentin by AFM-IR. Using the non-invasive, non-destructive AFM-IR technique, we obtained the IR absorption spectra at nanoscale, providing information of the chemical composition of human peritubular and intertubular dentin. Additionally, AFM-IR is able to provide the nanoscale chemical imaging to characterize the organic and mineral distribution in human dentin. In this study, we tested whether the chemical and mechanical properties of human peritubular dentin are different from intertubular dentin, and whether AFM-IR is a useful tool to identify the nanoscale chemical heterogeneity of human dentin.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nSpecimen preparation\nHuman third molars were obtained from patients between ages of 18 and 30 at the Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, as approved by the Research Ethics Committee (ERC-[2017]-18). The teeth were without any caries, cracks or other defects. The molars were stored in 0.9% phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH\u00a0=\u00a07.4) containing 0.002% sodium azide at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The roots were removed with a slow-speed water cooled diamond saw (Buehler Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, USA). The remaining tooth samples were sectioned longitudinally into beams of about 3.0\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.0\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.0\u00a0mm (Fig. 1\n). The dentin beams were mechanically fractured to avoid creation of a smear layer on cut surfaces. To be specific, two notches were made in the opposite sides of a dentin beam and it was then plunged into liquid nitrogen for 10\u00a0min and fractured along the line joining the notches.\n\n\nSEM observation\nThe dentin specimens described above were dehydrated in ascending grades of acetone (from 25% to 100%). Excess acetone was permitted to evaporate under a protective hood and the specimens subsequently coated with platinum (Pt) for 3\u00a0min. Observations were carried out with an FE-SEM (Ultra Zeiss Oberkochen, Germany) at 1\u20135\u00a0kV under an in-lens detector.\n\n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\nThree different spots on the surface of a specimen were randomly chosen and ATR-FTIR spectra were collected using the Thermo Nicolet 5700 spectrometer (Nicolet, Madison, WI). To be specific, the specimen was place on the face of the germanium crystal of the smart OMNI sampler accessory (Nicolet, Madison, WI) and the pointed tip of the standard pressure tower was adjusted to the center of the mark. Spectra were collected in the range from 750 to 4000\u00a0cm\u22121 at 4\u00a0cm\u22121 resolution by using 100\u00a0scans. The peaks ranging from 900 to 1800\u00a0cm\u22121 of the dentin specimen were recorded according to Bachmann et al [35,36].\n\n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD)\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to explore the crystallinity phases of dentin. The XRD profiles were recorded with a diffractometer (PANalytical-Empyrean instrument) using a step size of 0.02\u00b0\u00a0mrad\/s and a scan range 2\n\u03b8\n of 20\u201340\u00b0. The voltage and current were 40\u00a0kV and 40\u00a0mA respectively.\n\n\nAtomic force microscope infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR)\nThe IR absorption spectra were obtained using the Nano-IR2s instrument (Anasys Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) (https:\/\/www.bruker.com\/products\/surface-and-https:\/\/www.bruker.com\/products\/surface-and- dimensional-analysis\/nanoscale-infrared-spectrometers.html). The instrument consists of a tunable infrared laser focusing onto a sample in the proximity of the AFM probe tip. At each wavenumber of the laser, the oscillation amplitude of AFM cantilever is recorded to achieve IR absorption of the specimen. It is reported that the AFM cantilever oscillation amplitude is linearly dependent on the IR absorption. For each characterization, the focusing spot of the laser was tuned to optimize the oscillation amplitude of AFM cantilever. The specimen was fixed upon a metal plate with adhesive tape in between. The AFM scans in the AFM-IR were carried out in contact mode with a PR-EX-nIR2 gold-coated cantilever (resonance frequency: 13\u00a0kHz, spring constant: 0.23\u00a0N\/m). To enhance oscillation amplitude of AFM cantilever, the pulse frequency of the laser was synchronized and locked to the resonant frequency of the tip in contact with the specimen.\nThe single IR spectrum data were collected at selected sites with a wavenumber spacing of 2\u00a0cm\u22121. The incident laser power was set to 80% in the range from 900\u00a0cm\u22121 to 1800\u00a0cm\u22121. The IR spectra were normalized to a fixed laser power at each wavenumber via calibrating with the laser power detected by an IR sensitive photodetector. The spectra were smoothed in Analysis Studio, a software from Anasys Instruments. The baseline for each spectrum was determined through local minimum fitting. Then the baselines were subtracted to remove interference from IR absorbance in substrate and thick sample. The parameters including mineral\/protein ratio, crystallinity and acid phosphate content were assessed on basis of the corrected spectra [37].\nFor the IR chemical mapping, the laser power was adjusted to 82.4% for the mapping at 1033\u00a0cm\u22121, 1336\u00a0cm\u22121, 1692\u00a0cm\u22121. For all IR mapping, the scan rate was 0.2\u00a0Hz. Meanwhile, the topography images were recorded during mapping to keep the track of the specimen drifting. The 1692\u00a0cm\u22121\/1033\u00a0cm\u22121 intensity ratio map was generated from the 1692\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1033\u00a0cm\u22121 maps after the image shift correction.\n\n\nMechanical properties mapping\nMechanical properties of the dentin specimen were obtained in-situ with AM-FM mode via an Asylum Research MFP-3D Infinity AFM system. In AM-FM mode, the cantilever is excited near the first and second resonant frequencies simultaneously. The first-order resonance is operated in AM mode for morphology imaging. To be specific, the cantilever is excited near the first resonant frequency \n\n\nf\n1\n\n\n. The deflection signal of the cantilever is analyzed by a lock-in amplifier to determine the amplitude \n\n\nA\n1\n\n\n and phase \n\n\n\u03d5\n1\n\n\n response of the first eigenmode. During the scanning, the feedback loop adjusts \n\n\nA\n1\n\n\n to maintain constant that equal to amplitude setpoint \n\n\nA\n\n1\n,\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n\n, so that the displacement of scanner in z-direction can be used for morphology tracking. Meanwhile, the cantilever is also excited at the second resonant frequency\n\n\nf\n2\n\n\n. Here, a frequency feedback loop adjusts the frequency by a small amount \n\n\u0394\n\nf\n2\n\n\n to maintain the second eigenmode on resonance as the tip interacts with the sample.\nThe AM-FM signals were recorded by the lock-in and feedback system and can be used to extract the indentation depth [34,38]\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n=\n\n3\n4\n\n\n(\n\n\nk\n1\n\n\nQ\n1\n\n\n\nA\n\n1\n,\nf\nr\ne\ne\n\n\ncos\n\n\u03d5\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n2\n\nk\n2\n\n\u0394\n\nf\n2\n\n\n\nf\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nand effective storage modulus\n\n\n\n\nE\n\neff\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c0\nR\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nk\n1\n\n\nQ\n1\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n1\n,\nf\nr\ne\ne\n\n\n\nA\n\n1\n,\ns\ne\nt\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\u03d5\n1\n\n)\n\n\n-\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n2\n\nk\n2\n\n\u0394\n\nf\n2\n\n\n\nf\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n-\n\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nQ\n1\n\n\n ,\n\n\nA\n\n1\n,\nf\nr\ne\ne\n\n\n\n are the quality factor and \n\n\nA\n1\n\n\n of the cantilever in air under first resonant frequency, which can be obtained by the tuning procedure. \n\n\nk\n1\n\n\n and \n\n\nk\n2\n\n\n are the modal stiffness of the cantilever. \n\n\nk\n1\n\n\n can be obtained by force constant calibration. \n\n\nk\n1\n\n\n can be calculated by \n\n\nk\n2\n\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\nf\n2\n\n\nf\n1\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\nk\n1\n\n\n.\nIn this work, AC160TS-R3 probe (Olympus Ltd Tokyo, Japan) was adopted for AM-FM imaging. The force constant (modal stiffness of the first resonant frequency) of the probe was calibrated using the thermal noise method to be \n\n\nk\n1\n\n=\n\n26.125\u00a0N\/m. And its first and second resonance frequency was 270\u00a0kHz, and 1504\u00a0kHz respectively. Thus \n\n\nk\n2\n\n=\n810.758\n\nN\/m\n\n was obtained. The tip has a typical tip radius of 7\u00a0nm. The fractured dentin with exposed longitudinal section was scanned directly in AM-FM mode without preliminary treatment. The scan speed was set at 0.5 line\/s, and \n\n\nA\n\n1\n,\nf\nr\ne\ne\n\n\n\n was chosen to be 100\u00a0nm. Because the actual value of tip radius is difficult to know, AM-FM mode usually need a reference sample of known modulus to calibrate the tip radius. We used a clean glass slide as reference sample, which has a Young\u2019 modulus of 55 GPa [39]. And the tip radius was calibrated to be 8\u00a0nm. Schematic diagrams of methodology for AFM-IR and Bimodal AM-FM were shown in Fig. 2\n.\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nSpectral characterizations of peritubular and intertubular dentin\nTo confirm the sample preparation procedure exposes the dentin surface correctly, we observed the fractured dentin surface with SEM. The typical image with dentinal tubules perpendicular to the surface is shown in Fig. 3\n. The dentin tubules, seen in transverse cross section, are surrounded by peritubular dentin and connected by intertubular dentin. The peritubular dentin appears as ring-like structures and is distinguished from intertubular dentin by its appearance being brighter, more dense and smoother; while the intertubular dentin seems more disorganized and rugged and (as seen in Fig. 3B), seemed tightly packed with fibers. The average width of the peritubular dentin is about 1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0\u03bcm, which were in accordance with previous reports [4,7,40].\nTo clarify the chemical distribution difference between peritubular and intertubular dentin, IR absorption spectra of the peritubular dentin and the intertubular dentin were obtained using the nano-IR in the range from 900 to 1800\u00a0cm\u22121 (Fig. 4\n). The spectrum, without background modification, is available in Fig. S1 as an attachment. The absorption bands associated with the organic contents at 1532 and 1596\u00a0cm\u22121 are assigned to amide II; the peak at around 1692\u00a0cm\u22121 assigned to amide I, at around 1206, 1254, 1280 and 1360 (1380) cm\u22121 assigned to amide III, at around 1336\u00a0cm\u22121 assigned to SO stretching vibrations (sulfonamide) [1,4,16,41\u201353]. The absorption peaks associated with mineral contents at around 932, 966, 1033, 1088, 1148, 1442 and 1490\u00a0cm\u22121, are assigned to PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n1, PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n1, PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3, PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3, HPO4\n2\u2212, CO3\n2\u2212\n\u03bd\n3 and CO3\n2\u2212\n\u03bd\n3, respectively [4,16,41,42,46].\nThe detailed information about the locations and assignments of AFM-IR spectra from intertubular dentin and peritubular dentin is listed in Table 1\n. Several absorption bands were observed both in peritubular and intertubular dentin spectra (Table 1). As the amide I and III bands were typical of collagen, our study supported that peritubular dentin contains collagen, which was also observed by other researchers [4,16]. Besides the peaks assigned amide I, amide II and amide III, a unique band at 1336\u00a0cm\u22121 assigned to the SO stretching modes of sulfonamide [45], was detected in peritubular dentin. As chondroitin sulfate has been identified by immnunohistochemistry [54], it was speculated the 1336\u00a0cm\u22121 band in peritubular dentin may be originated from chondroitin sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan on cell surfaces and within pericellular matrices in the form of proteoglycans, plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes [55]. In addition, a unique band of 1490\u00a0cm\u22121 assigned to CO3\n2\u2212\n\u03bd\n3 was observed only in peritubular dentin, indicating that peritubular dentin may contain a greater variety of inorganic contents than intertubular dentin. When analyzing the FTIR spectrum of human dentin (Fig. S2), we found that all absorption peaks in FTIR spectrum were also found in the AFM-IR spectra. The shift between FTIR and AFM-IR spectra was slight. More details of absorption peaks were observed in AFM-IR spectra, indicating the higher resolution of local IR characterization. XRD profile of dentin could be accessed in Fig. S3 as an attachment file. As indicated by Fig. S3, the diffraction peak (0\u00a00\u00a02) at 2\n\u03b8\n\u00a0=\u00a025.90\u00b0, (2\u00a01\u00a01) at 2\n\u03b8\n\u00a0=\u00a031.77\u00b0, (1\u00a01\u00a02) at 2\n\u03b8\n\u00a0=\u00a032.19\u00b0 and (3\u00a00\u00a00) at 2\n\u03b8\n\u00a0=\u00a032.90\u00b0are all characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals according to International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD). However, it is important to point out that XRD analysis can only provide the average inorganic information of dentin and cannot distinguish peritubular dentin from intertubular dentin [56\u201362].\nAs shown by IR spectrum, the intensity of 932, 966, 1088 and 1148\u00a0cm\u22121 band of peritubular dentin is higher than that of intertubular dentin. The mineral\/protein (PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n1\n\u03bd\n3\/amide I) ratio (932\/1692\u00a0cm\u22121, 966\/1692\u00a0cm\u22121, 1033\/1692\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1088\/1692\u00a0cm\u22121) of peritubular dentin is found to be significantly higher than that of intertubular dentin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), indicating that peritubular dentin has more mineral content than intertubular dentin. Crystallinity and acid phosphate content are useful for understanding the mineralization process. Crystallinity, which is an index of crystal size\/perfection, represents the degree of long range order of material and strongly affects its quality [63]. As measured by the 1033\/1020\u00a0cm\u22121 ratio, the crystallinity of intertubular dentin (1.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02) is significantly higher than that of peritubular dentin (1.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), indicating that intertubular dentin contained more highly crystalline apatite. The acid phosphate content (1148\/1088\u00a0cm\u22121) is significantly greater for peritubular dentin (1.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01) than for intertubular dentin (0.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nGenerally, increasing the degree of crystallinity indicates a relatively lower degree of imperfections, disorders and substitutions [63]. In our study, the crystallographic structure of peritubular dentin was found to be lower than that of intertubular dentin, meaning that although peritubular dentin is highly calcified, the calcified material may not be apatite mineral [54,63,64]. As reported before, the types of mineralization in majority of dentin was extracellular matrix (ECM) molecular-derived mineralization, including extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar mineralization [65,66]. For intertubular dentin, non-mineralized predentin formation preceded maturation of dentin [66]. Peritubular dentin did not result from such transformation of predentin into dentin. Proteoglycans, lipids and other ECM proteins were in the formation of a thin amorphous network, leading to a dense hypermineralized peritubular dentin [66]. Besides, when considering the mechanism of biological hydroxyapatite formation of dentin, the mineral nucleation and mineral propagation can be expected to differ between these two structures. Further study of these conjectures needs to be carried out.\n\n\n\nAFM-IR imaging of peritubular and intertubular dentin\nTo reveal the distribution of each chemical component, IR chemical mapping was conducted on longitudinal section of dentin, in which the IR source was respectively tuned to 1033\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponding to PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3, 1336\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponding to SO stretching vibrations (sulfonamide), and 1692\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponding to amide I (Fig. 5\n). The distribution of PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3 and SO stretching vibrations (sulfonamide), as well as amide I are uneven between peritubular and intertubular and dentin. As shown in Fig. 5A and 5B, PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3 and SO stretching vibrations (sulfonamide) typically exhibit relative high intensity (dark yellow signal) in peritubular dentin, whereas light red and blue PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3 and SO stretching vibrations (sulfonamide) signals suggest a relative low intensity in intertubular dentin. In Fig. 5C, the intertubular dentin shows intense amide I signal, while peritubular dentin exhibits relative weak amide I intensity. The chemical mapping images allow for the visualization of distribution of various aggregates in peritubular dentin and intertubular dentin.\nThe results of Fig. 5 were consistent with the result of Fig. 4A indicated by the IR spectrum. The finding of low intensity of amide I in human peritubular dentin compared to intertubular dentin in this study was consistent with the previous studies [4,8,16]. To be specific, the mineral content of peritubular dentin was much more abundant than that of intertubular dentin, while the organic matter of peritubular dentin was much less than that of intertubular dentin [4]. Hard tissues in vertebrate animals, such as dentin, bone and cementum are generated by mesenchymal cells that express a matrix of fibrillar collagen type I, which mineralizes through the introduction of apatite nanocrystals into the fibrils and into the extrafibrillar space [8]. As previous studies showed that peritubular dentin forms from an extracellular matrix rich in glutamic acid, it is considered an exception among mineralized tissues [67,68].\n\nFig. 6\n shows the amide I\/PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3 peak intensity ratio map generated from 1692 cm\u22121\u00a0(amide I) map and 1033\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0(PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3) map after image shift correction with the AFM image. As indicated in\u00a0Fig. 6C, the intertubular dentin exhibits relative higher amide I\/ PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3\u00a0intensity than peritubular dentin, suggesting the amide I\/ PO4\n3\u2212\n\u03bd\n3\u00a0ratio is more abundant in intertubular dentin than in peritubular dentin, which is in accordance with the results of chemical mapping.\n\nThe Young\u2019s modulus of peritubular and intertubular dentin\nYoung\u2019s Modulus mapping of the longitudinal section of dentin was obtained with AFM AM-FM mode. As shown in Fig. 7\nA, the peritubular dentin shows a flat and smooth structure whereas the intertubular dentin has many globular structures. In the Young\u2019s modulus image (Fig. 7B), the color scale represents relative difference in the Young\u2019s modulus, differentiating between intertubular dentin and peritubular dentin. In Fig. 7A, the black, roughly linear, trough-like structure going from bottom left to upper right is the dentin tubular space once occupied by the odontoblastic process. Roughly parallel to this trough-like structure is a yellow structure showing higher Young\u2019s modulus, which is the lamella of peritubular dentin observed in longitudinal section (Fig. 7B).\nThe peritubular dentin surrounding the dentin tubule, indicated in yellow in Fig. 7B, shows the Young\u2019s modulus value of 32.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.67 GPa, while the intertubular dentin connecting the tubules, indicated in blue, has a Young\u2019s modulus of 20.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.97 GPa (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Meanwhile, AM-FM imaging also provides the indentation mapping, which is shown in Fig. 7C. The average indentation values of the peritubular dentin and intertubular dentin are calculated by averaging 5 indentation values from each region, which are 0.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0nm and 0.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0nm, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Peritubular dentin is thus much stiffer than intertubular dentin.\nThe mineral\/protein ratio of peritubular dentin was significantly higher compared to intertubular dentin. As for mechanical properties, peritubular dentin had a higher Young\u2019s modulus than intertubular dentin, suggesting a positive relationship exists between mineral content and mechanical properties of dentin. In accordance with our findings, it was reported that the hardness of dentin was dependent on its mineral content and reduction of dentin hardness was directly linked to the decreased mineral content [69]. Notably, as dentin heterogeneities at very small scales can be identified, mechanical information of peritubular and intertubular dentin cannot be obtained with standard physical tests. The AFM indentation method improves the accuracy of modulus at micro- and even nano-scales, due to the introduction of an experimentally determined tip area function [70].\nIn the present study, we employed nanoscale AFM-IR to characterize the chemical nature of human peritubular and intertubular dentin, both inorganic and organic phases, for the first time. As reported by literature, FTIR spectroscopy has been used in analyzing the organic and mineral composition in horse dentin and there was collagen in both peritubular and intertubular dentin [16]. However, Habelita et al reported that piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) cannot detect any piezoelectric response in human peritubular dentin, thus it should be a non-collagenous tissue [8]. An invasive and destructive method of immunohistochemistry have proved that chondroitin sulfate was the typical phosphoproteins of peritubular dentin [54], which was consistent with the result of this study. Compared with previous studies, our study showed that most of organic content (amide I, II, III) and mineral content of peritubular dentin are similar to those of intertubular dentin. A distinctive band of 1336\u00a0cm\u22121 indicative of the SO stretching vibrations (sulfonamide) was detected in peritubular dentin, but was absent in intertubular dentin. A summary of the comparison of our results with existing reports was shown in Table S1 as an attachment file [16,31,32,71,72].\nAs an outstanding technique in exploring the nano-topography and chemical constituents of biomaterial [23\u201330], AFM-IR technique can be employed for investigating the relationship of organic and inorganic components and deciphering the biochemical mineralization mechanism of dentin in the near future. Although there are excellent advantages of applying AFM-IR in directly characterizing the peritubular and intertubular dentin, we need to consider the limitation of this study. The teeth samples in this study were selected from patients between ages of 18 and 30, however, it is reported that ageing of teeth may influence the parameters of chemical components and mechanical properties [71,73]. It would be useful to analyze the heterogeneity of human dentin from different age groups in the future.\nThis study indicated that AFM-IR can be used in the future to analyze changes in human dentin mineral formation in health and disease (eg. dentinogenesis imperfecta). Additionally, in response to acidic and bacterial attacks, chemical characteristics such as mineral\/protein ratio, crystallinity and acid phosphate content of dentin should be investigated in response to acidic and bacterial attacks.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conducted AFM-IR and AM-FM analyses of human dentin which confirmed our conjecture that the chemical and mechanical properties of peritubular dentin are different from intertubular dentin. This is the first study to characterize the chemical composition and distribution of human dentin by AFM-IR technique, proving AFM-IR is a suitable and rapid method for identification of the chemical contents in human calcified tissues at nanoscale.\nThis study paves the way for investigating mineral deposition mechanisms of peritubular and intertubular dentin and analyzing pathological changes in dentinal structure and composition in response to acidic and bacterial attacks in future studies.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics requirements\n\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008 (5). Informed consent was obtained from all patients for being included in the study.\n\n","48":"\n\nIntroduction\nEpilepsy is a common nervous disorder that affects about 70 million people worldwide [1,2]. Epilepsy disturbs the life quality and can cause health and financial problems for the society [3]. The high incidence of wounds during seizures and the high rate of mortality compared to healthy subjects led to weakening the health quality of people [4,5]. Recently, new approaches assisted in finding new classes of antiepileptic agents, such as ezogabine.\nEzogabine (EZG) (Fig. 1\nA), N-[2-amino-4-(4-fluorobenzylamino)-phenyl] carbamic acid ethyl ester, also known as retigabine, has been approved in 2011 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency [6] and approved and marketed in Egypt in 2017. It is a third-generation antiepileptic drug that acts by activating low-threshold voltage-gated potassium channels in the brain followed by decreased neuronal excitability with better safety profile [7,8]. It is mainly used for treatment of patients with partial seizures and also useful for treating neuropathic pain and migraine [9\u201311]. Ezogabine median time to Cmax is 0.5\u20132.0 hr. Then, a mono-exponential decline in plasma concentrations occurs with a median half-life of 6\u20138 hr. Absolute oral bioavailability of ezogabine is ~60%. Its major metabolism happens through N-acetylation and subsequent N-glucuronidation [12].\nPharmacokinetic interindividual variability is mostly the origin of the variation in clinical response to drug administration. In general, this variability may be attributed to the inter-individual variation in the rates the drug is absorbed, distributed and eliminated. Among these factors, gender is quite significant [13,14]. In a previous study, the effect of gender on ezogabine pharmacokinetics in white subjects was evaluated and it was reported the higher AUC and Cmax values in females than in males [15].\nEzogabine was reported to be estimated by several HPLC methods. Three of these are developed for its determination in pharmaceutical formulations [16\u201318], four stability-indicating methods by HPLC-UV [19\u201321], three other methods used LC-MS\/MS for its determination in dog plasma [22], in human plasma [23] and for identification of four EZG impurities [24].\nAccordingly, the objective of carrying this work was to determine the impact of gender on the pharmacokinetics of ezogabine among Egyptian population and if gender-based dose adjustment is required. A new bioanalytical method was developed and the validation was carried out following US-FDA [25] and EMA [26] guidelines. The developed method was applied to study the difference in the pharmacokinetics of ezogabine between males (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and female subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a015).\n\n\nExperimental\n\nInstrumentation\nAn Agilent HPLC 1260 series with auto-sampler, gradient quaternary pump vacuum degasser and mixer was used and connected to MS\/MS detector (model 6410A)., Agilent MassHunter Workstation software (B.07.00) was used for data acquisition. Other instruments including Vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Germany), cooling Centrifuge (Sigma, Germany), Jenway pH-meter (3505, Essex, U.K.), vortex mixer (Stuart, England), and ultrasonic processor (Elma, Germany) were used. Nylon membrane filter (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Germany) was used for mobile phase filtration. The validated WinNonlin 7.0 software (Certara USA) was used for pharmacokinetics calculations.\n\n\nMaterial and reagents\nEzogabine was supplied and certified by Optimus, India. Oxcarbazepine (Fig. 1B) was supplied and certified by Amoli organics pvt Ltd, India. Diethyl ether was supplied and certified by Carbon group. Dichloromethane was supplied and certified by Biochem. Methanol and acetonitrile were supplied and certified by Sigma, Germany. Ammonium acetate was supplied and certified by Loba chemie, India. Membrane filters 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm from ChromTech (UK) were used. All other chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade unless indicated otherwise. Human plasma specimens acquired from blood bank was used for priori and in-life validation.\n\n\nLC-MS\/MS conditions\nSeparation was carried out on a reversed phase ZORBAX Eclipse plus C18, 5\u00a0\u00b5m. The mobile phase was 5\u00a0mM ammonium acetate: methanol: acetonitrile, 30:50:20 v\/v\/v. The column temperature was adjusted at 40\u00a0\u00b0C at a flow rate of 0.6\u00a0ml\/min with an injection volume 2\u00a0\u03bcL. The retention times of Ezogabine and oxcarbazepine were about 1.4 and 1.6\u00a0min, respectively within a run time of 3.0\u00a0min duration.\nBoth ezogabine and IS were detected by operating the MS\/MS system with the positive ion mode using a spray gas pressure of 45 psi with a nitrogen flow of 11\u00a0L\/min, capillary voltage (4000\u00a0V) and dwell times (200\u00a0ms). Fragmentor voltage was set at 130.0\u00a0V for ezogabine and at 135.0\u00a0V for IS while the collision energies were set at 1.0\u00a0V for ezogabine and 5.0\u00a0V for IS. MRM transitions were measured at: m\/z 304.1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0229.9 for ezogabine and m\/z 253.2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0236.1 for IS.\n\n\nPreparation of standard solutions\nA solution of ezogabine in 100\u00a0ml methanol was prepared (Solution A, 200\u00a0\u00b5g\/mL). Then, it was diluted with diluent I (methanol: water, 50:50, v\/v) to prepare Solution B (20\u00a0\u00b5g\/mL) and Solution C (5000\u00a0ng\/mL). A solution of oxcarbazepine in 100\u00a0mL methanol was prepared (Solution D, 100\u00a0\u00b5g\/mL), which was further diluted with diluent I to prepare Solution E (10000\u00a0ng\/mL). All the standards were stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C till the time of analysis.\n\n\nCalibration and quality control samples preparation\nPrepared calibration curves consisted each of 8 calibration standards, a blank sample and a zero sample to be quantified. Control human plasma (450\u00a0\u03bcL) was spiked with 50\u00a0\u00b5L of IS stock solution E and 50\u00a0\u00b5L of Ezogabine standards solutions to prepare the Calibration standards. So, the spiked samples final concentration of calibration standards will be in the range of 10\u20132000\u00a0ng\/mL and the QC\u2019s are 30, 800 and 1600\u00a0ng\/mL for QCL, QCM and QCH, respectively, then the samples were mixed by vortex.\n\n\nSample preparation\nFive mL of diethyl ether: dichloromethane (70:30, v\/v) were added to each sample (0.5\u00a0mL), then, fifty \u00b5L of IS (Solution E 10,000\u00a0ng\/mL) were added and the mixture was vortexed for 1\u00a0min and centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 4500 r.p.m. The organic layer was separated, evaporated under vacuum, then reconstituted in 100\u00a0\u00b5L of the mobile phase, and injected on the column.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic study\nThe main aim of this study is to explore the impact of gender on the pharmacokinetics of ezogabine in Egyptian volunteers (n\u00a0=\u00a025; 10 male and 15 female). The review and approval of the experimental procedures and protocols were carried out by the ethics committee of Pharmasolutions CRO, Cairo, Egypt. Male and female volunteers were fasted for 10\u00a0h but consuming only water one hour before and two hours after dosing (oral tablet containing 400\u00a0mg EZG). Blood samples (5.0\u00a0mL) were collected from a forearm vein into polypropylene tubes containing K2EDTA at 0.00 (pre-dose), 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48\u00a0h after dosing after oral administration of Trobalt 400\u00a0mg film coated tablets. The samples were immediately centrifuged, to separate plasma which was stored at \u201370\u00a0\u00b0C until time of analysis. For analysis, calibrators and samples were thawed without assistance for about 60\u00a0min. Concentrations of EZG in plasma of subjects were calculated using the validated LC\u2013MS\/MS bioanalytical method. The pharmacokinetic parameters for EZG were calculated using the validated WinNonlin 7.0 software. Pharmacokinetics Parameters were determined using a non-compartmental approach with a log-linear terminal phase assumption. Linear trapezoidal rule was used to calculate AUC0-t (AUC from time 0 to the last measurable Cp). The extrapolated AUC (from time of the last measurable Cp to infinity) was estimated from the last measurable Cp divided by \u03bbz. AUC0-inf (AUC from time 0 to infinity) equals to AUC0-t plus the extrapolated AUC (AUCt-inf). Cmax was obtained from observed time-Cp profile.\nStatistical analysis of the obtained data was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software.\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nMethod development\n\nMass spectrometric detection optimization\nOptimization of tandem mass parameters were carried out to obtain the maximum response for both drug and IS. The MRM was selected based on the highest sensitivity. Detection of ezogabine and IS was carried out using the following transitions: m\/z 304.1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0229.9 and m\/z 253.2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0236.2, respectively.\n\n\n\nPlasma extraction optimization\nExtraction of plasma samples is essential in bioanalytical methods to ensure maximum sample purification from plasma components. Plasma samples were extracted with different solvent mixtures such as dichloromethane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate or tri-butyl methyl ether. Finally, diethyl ether: dichloromethane (70:30, v\/v) resulted in high response and good percentage recovery.\n\n\nChromatographic conditions optimization\nChromatographic conditions were optimized by trying various stationary phases and mobile phase composition. Tried columns include C18 Zorbax, Eclipse Plus (1.8\u00a0\u00b5m, 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.1\u00a0mm) and reversed phase C18 INERTSIL ODS (3.5\u00a0\u00b5m, 150\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.6\u00a0mm). For mobile phase optimization, ammonium acetate, ammonium formate buffers or aqueous formic acid were tried in mixture with an organic modifier such as methanol and\/or acetonitrile. Good peak shapes and separation were obtained by using methanol and acetonitrile. Ammonium formate buffer (5\u00a0mM) was found to be the optimum to obtain the highest detection response (Fig. 2\n).\n\n\nBioanalytical method validation\nPre-study validation for bioanalytical method development assures the suitability of the method for planned application. The following validation parameters are usually evaluated for quantitative procedures: linearity, quantitation limit, matrix effect, selectivity, recovery, precision, accuracy, robustness, and stability and dilution integrity. In-process validation was carried out analyzed using QC samples. With each batch, QC samples were prepared and analyzed along with subjects\u2019 samples.\nLLOQ of ezogabine is 10\u00a0ng\/mL with a percentage of nominal concentration of 97.99% and a CV of 9.65%. ULOQ (Upper Limit of Quantification) was 2000\u00a0ng\/mL.\nThe concentrations of calibration standards covered the range (10\u20132000\u00a0ng\/mL). Weighted linear regression (1\/X2) was applied. In the present method, calibration curve was found to be consistently accurate and precise over the concentration range of 10\u20132000\u00a0ng\/mL. The mean Coefficient of Determination (R2) is equal to 0.9989.\nMethod selectivity was tested by treating and chromatographing six blank samples from different sources. No significant interference was detected in all the plasma blanks at the retention times of ezogabine and IS (Fig. 3\n).\nRecovery of the drug was calculated by comparing mean analyte responses of three processed QC samples obtained by the usual extraction procedure (without addition of internal standard) with working solutions analyzed without processing. The average recovery across the three concentrations was not affected by concentration. Recovery of oxcarbazepine (internal standard) from human plasma by the assay method was assessed by comparing mean IS response from one distinct concentration in plasma (IS working solution) with working solutions of the same concentration. Table 1\n shows high recovery results confirming good extraction efficiency.\nMatrix effect was calculated using six batches of blank matrix from individual volunteers at low and high QC sample levels. The IS normalized MF and the CV% of the IS-normalized MF are presented in Table S1, See Supplementary File. Moreover, carry over test was carried out by injecting blank sample after each ULOQ calibrator (n\u00a0=\u00a06) (Table S2, See Supplementary File).\nTo assess the precision and accuracy, six determinations of LLOQ and quality control samples were analyzed on three different days (Table 1).\nIn the present method, Dilution integrity quality control samples were prepared by diluting plasma stock with a concentration of 3600\u00a0ng\/mL. Six samples were diluted twice and six others were diluted four times. Precision and accuracy were confirmed for both dilution factors.\nCoefficient of variation% test was 5.051 and 6.328 for two-fold and four-fold dilution, respectively. The accuracy results were 99.537 and 101.774 for two-fold and four-fold dilution, respectively.\nTo test short term stability, thawing of triplicates of the low and high QCs (including the addition of internal standard) was carried out at room temperature (22.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b0C) and then analyzed after keeping it this temperature for 6\u00a0h. This was repeated but with freshly processed QC samples with calibration curve and then analyzed for comparison. Results confirm the stability of the analyte and internal standard in processed samples at the room temperature for up to 24 hrs without significant effect on concentration.\nFreeze and thaw stability testing was carried out by the storage of samples at two concentrations (QCL, QCH) at \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C for at least 12\u00a0h followed by thawing unassisted at room temperature for one hour. This was repeated for four cycles. After the third cycle, thawed samples were quantified together with comparison samples.\nFor long term stability, three replicates were prepared in human plasma at two concentrations (QCL, QCH) and stored at \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C (Stability solutions).\nThree aliquots of each of the low and high QCs (including the addition of internal standard) were extracted as mentioned before but left at dry state without reconstitution with the mobile phase for 45\u00a0h at room temperature.\nResults confirm the stability of the analyte and internal standard in the processed samples at room temperature for up to 24 hrs, after three Freeze and thaw cycles, and in the dry extract at the room temperature for up to 45 hrs for the entire period of the study without significant effect on concentration.\nAutosampler stability was assessed by preparing QCL and QCH samples and then processed and left for 24 hrs at room temperature (22.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b0C). Samples were found to be stable for up to 24 hrs.\nThe stability of the drug and the internal standard stock solutions was evaluated at room temperature (22.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b0C) for at least 6\u00a0h. Results confirm the stability of the analyte and internal standard stock solutions at room temperature for up to 6 hrs and frozen at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0days (Table 1).\n\n\nPharmacokinetic study\nAlthough an equal number of males and females was targeted in the beginning of the study, it ended up to uneven number of the two genders (males, n\u00a0=\u00a010 and females, n\u00a0=\u00a015) as a result of inclusion\/exclusion criteria. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used for the statistical comparison of the two groups as it is the true nonparametric counterpart of the t-test and it was found that the data do not follow a normal distribution [27].\nAs shown in Fig. 4\n, the male and female pharmacokinetic profiles are plotted. The summary of their PK parameters and their statistical description are listed in Table S3, See Supplementary File. Such results show that the difference in ezogabine concentration between males and females have been identified with higher concentrations among males.\nThe tmax and AUC were not significantly different between the two genders. A slight insignificant difference of the average time needed in male and female for attaining maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) where the tmax was 2.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.39\u00a0h in men and 4.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.08\u00a0h in women (p\u00a0=\u00a00.1349; confidence level (CL)\u00a0=\u00a095). Likewise, the total exposure of ezogabine in both male and female subjects was found insignificantly different (AUC\u00a0=\u00a09479.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05928.49 and 6281.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02514.77 hr.ng\/mL, respectively) with moderately increased extent of exposure in men compared with women. No significant difference was found between the weight-normalized CL\/F and Vz\/F of male and female.\nOn the other hand, women exhibited significantly longer t1\/2 (10.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0h) than in men (8.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.18\u00a0h), (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0301; CL\u00a0=\u00a095). Similarly, a significant different Cmax was observed with higher Cmax in male compared to female (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0308; CL\u00a0=\u00a095). These findings are not in agreement with previously reported study on white subjects, where the pharmacokinetic parameters were to some extent higher in women over men [15], which denotes that a gender-based inter-individual variability is observed in the pharmacokinetics of ezogabine among different populations.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nGender-based variation in the pharmacokinetic profile of ezogabine among Egyptian subjects was studied using a validated LC-MS\/MS method. The pharmacokinetic profile of the studied Egyptian subjects was highly variable among individuals with significant difference in terms of both Cmax and t1\/2 between male and female subjects. Moreover, the results were not in agreement with a previous study on white subjects, highlighting on a gender-based inter-individual variability among populations. This presented the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid possible side-effects or sub-therapeutic doses and subsequently considering gender-based dose adjustment.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008 (5). Informed consent was obtained from all patients for being included in the study.\n\n","49":"\n\nIntroduction\nAbout 54.3% of the sunlight that arrives the earth is infrared rays [1,2]. Infrared radiations have been sub-classified, among which, far-infrared (FIR) can transfer energy to other objects in the form of heat [3]. Several studies have reported health-promoting properties of FIR in the murine and cell models. For instance, FIR has shown anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in a peritonitis mouse model [4]. In another study, Chang et al. reported that FIR could protect spinocerebellar ataxia cells by inhibiting PolyQ protein accumulation and improving mitochondrial function. PolyQ disease is a rare neurodegenerative disease and lacking an effective treatment strategy [5]. Similarly, anti-cancer abilities of FIR have also been observed by the growth arrest of HSC3, A549, and Sa3 cancerous cells through the upregulated expression of the ATF3 gene that led to the activation of tumor suppressor gene p53 [6]. Likewise, FIR has shown to inhibit the growth of spontaneous mammary tumors in a mouse model [7]. However, despite all these beneficial abilities of FIR, the fundamental mechanism is still unknown.\nIt is well recognized that commensal microbes play an integral role in the host\u2019s digestion and immune systems [8]. Any perturbation in the diversity and composition of gut microbiota (GM) could severely impact the host physiology [9]. Some of the external stimuli that can affect GM composition include ingested foods, dietary supplements, and antibiotic treatments. How would radiation energy, such as FIR, affect the composition of the gut microbiome is unknown. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of FIR on GM in the C57BL\/6J mouse model and to unveil the mystery behind the health benefit of the FIR radiation. In this study, mice were given five consecutive exposures to FIR within 12\u00a0h. The fecal GM composition was determined using Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC)-PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. The physiological effect of the host was determined by the expression of SCFA-sensing G-protein coupled receptors in the gut epithelial barrier.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nFIR radiating device\nSeveral FIR-emitting devices are commercially available [3]. In this study, we used EEFit\u00ae Pen, a FIR emitting device commercially available (Nick Wang Technology Limited). This handheld device emits electromagnetic waves of 4 \u2013 20 \u00b5m with 85.61% average FIR emissivity and photon energy level 12.4 MeV\u20131.7 eV [10].\n\n\nAnimals maintenance and treatment\nMice were kept in cages with free access to food (PicoLab\u00aeRodent 20\u20135053; LabDiet, USA) and water. Mice were housed in a 12\u00a0h\u2019 light-dark cycle facility in the Animal Center of the Macau University of Science and Technology. For FIR radiation treatment, the mouse was held by hand with the belly facing up and keeping at a 2\u00a0cm distance from the FIR emission device which was mounted on a stand (Fig. 1\nA). To rule out any stress-induced changes on the GM composition, the control mice were also held by hand for the same time frame as the FIR-treated mice. The treatment schemes are illustrated in Fig. 1. In brief, each FIR radiation lasted for 2\u00a0min with either 4\u00a0h (Scheme I) or 2\u00a0h (Scheme II) interval between each radiation. Fecal samples were collected from individual mice before and after FIR-treatment as indicated in the treatment schemes (Fig. 1). All the fecal samples were stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for later DNA extraction.\n\n\nGenomic DNA extraction, ERIC-PCR analysis, and 16S amplicon sequencing\nTotal genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The extracted DNA samples were analyzed for similarity among groups using conserved ERIC regions with a pair of ERIC-1 and ERIC-2 primers and plotted with PLS-DA tool as previously described [11]. DNA samples were sequenced for 16S rRNA genes using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego), targeting the V3\u2013V4 region with barcoded 515F and 806R universal primers and processed as previously described [12]. Briefly, dual-index barcodes and Illumina sequencing adapters were used to join the reads using limited PCR cycle. After purification with Agencourt AMPure beads (Agencourt, USA), Nextera XT protocol was used for library normalization. And then, samples were loaded into a single flow cell for sequencing on the MiSeq sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Clusters were generated and paired-end sequenced with dual index reads in a single run with a read length of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300\u00a0bp. PANDAseq was used for collecting paired-end sequences, and Raw FASTQ files were obtained. Sequences were trimmed of primers and barcodes. All the reads with \u2018N\u2019 and those with sequences <250\u00a0bp were removed. The cleaned sequences were then clustered at k\u00a0=\u00a010 (97% similarity) followed by deletion of chimeras and singleton reads. Finally, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were classified using BLASTn against a 16S National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-derived database (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, http:\/\/rdp.cme.msu.edu). The data has been submitted to NCBI SRA under ID PRJNA514213.\n\n\nQuantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis\nAt the end of Day 1 and Day 25, mice (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were euthanized, intestinal mucosal tissues were collected for RNA extraction RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, German) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mRNA expressions of GPRs 41, 43 and 109 were conducted using qRT-PCR analysis as previously described [11]. The q-PCR analysis was performed on fecal DNA samples to identify the relative abundance of SCFA- producing bacteria and the specific gene sequences encoded the bacterial enzymes (butyrate transferase, butyrate kinase and mm-CoA decarboxylase) involved in the synthesis of the SCFAs. Specific primer sequences used for the PCR analysis were listed in Table 1\n. \u03b2-actin was employed as the internal control for qRT-PCR. All qPCR assays were normalized with a universal primer set for the 16S rRNA gene of total bacteria. The 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method was applied to calculate the fold change of relative gene expression. \u0394\u0394Ct\u00a0=\u00a0(Ct treatment_target gene\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Ct treatment_reference gene)\u00a0\u2212\u00a0(Ct control_target gene\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Ct control_reference gene).\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nR packages phyloseq (1.22.3) was used for alpha and beta diversity analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was performed with bioBakery (version 17). Alpha values were set to 0.05 whereas the threshold on the logarithmic score of linear discriminant analysis was \u22652.0. SPSS (version 22) for statistical analysis. Data normality was ascertained with Kolmogorov\u2013SmirnovD test. Statistical significance was ascertained with Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nOptimization of the FIR exposure scheme\nSince there was no prior reference to the effect of FIR radiation on gut microbes, our first task was to check whether GM would respond to FIR radiation and what would be the FIR exposure scheme to detect significant changes in GM. For this purpose, nine mice from the same cage were randomly divided into three groups: namely, the control group, the 1st group received three exposures of FIR radiation and designated as Scheme I, and the 2rd group received five exposures of FIR and designated as Scheme II (Fig. 1A). Based on the ERIC-PCR results, we found that the Scheme II yielded greater separation between the FIR-treated and the control groups (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.63) compared to the group separation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.37) in Scheme I based on the PERMANOVA test (Fig. 1B).\n\n\nTransient exposure to FIR induced compositional and temporal changes in GM profile assessed by ERIC-PCR based analysis\nHenceforth, the Scheme II was adopted for the subsequent experiments (Fig. 1C). Under this scheme, we evaluated both the transient and the longitudinal effects of FIR using ERIC-PCR analysis on fecal samples collected on Day1 (D1), Day 2 (D2), Day3 (D3) and Day 25 (D25) from both treated and the control groups. To our surprise, the FIR-induced changes in GM composition sustained up to 25\u00a0days after the initial exposure on D0 (Fig. 1D).\n\n\n16S sequencing of the mouse fecal DNAs revealed the FIR treatment is in favor of the growth of beneficial bacteria\nFor in-depth GM analysis, 16S sequencing experiment was carried out (Fig. 2\nA). Like ERIC-PCR analysis, UniFrac analysis separated 16S sequences of the FIR-treated mice from that of control mice (Fig. 2A). There was a slight decrease in the OTUs diversity in the FIR-D1 (Chao1\u00a0=\u00a03844.97, Shannon\u00a0=\u00a04.6) compared to the Ctrl-D1 mice (Chao1\u00a0=\u00a03875.83, Shannon\u00a0=\u00a04.6); however, enrichment of OTUs diversity was observed later at D25 (Chao1\u00a0=\u00a04057.67, Shannon\u00a0=\u00a04.7) (Fig. 2B).\nParticularly, the abundance of phyla Tenericutes and Deferribacteres was significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.049, respectively) reduced in the gut of FIR-D1 compared to Ctrl-D1 mice (Fig. 2C). These two phyla are comprised several pathogenic bacteria that dwell in the gut and the buccal mucosa of the host [13,14]. Lower abundance of Deferribacteres in the FIR-irradiated mice (Fig. 2C) was mainly related to the reduced abundance of Mucispirillum (Fig. 2E). Similarly, the decrease of Tenericutes (Fig. 2C and D) was mainly related to the decreased abundance of genus Mycoplasma (Fig. 2F). Moreover, the suppressed abundance of Verrucomicrobia with FIR exposure (Fig. 2C) was contributed to the lower OTUs count of Akkermansia muciniphila (Fig. 2G), a commensal bacterium found to be negatively correlated with inflammation and obesity [15]. Furthermore, an increasing trend in the prevalence of Bacteroidetes was observed in FIR-exposed mice (Fig. 2C), which is mainly caused by the enhanced growth of Barnesiella and Prevotella species (Fig. 2H). Complete lists of FIR-enhanced and -suppressed bacteria are shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. S2, respectively.\nBased on the linear discriminant analysis (LEfSe), on D1, FIR radiation mainly induced the growth of Barnesiella spp., Alistipes massiliensis, Clostridium indolis, Prevotella spp., and Barnesiella intestinihominis (Fig. 3\nA). On D25, the FIR-treated mice displayed enrichment of Bacteroides oleiciplenus, Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum, Parabacteroides merdae, and Helicobacter ganmani (Fig. 3B).\n\n\nFIR enhanced the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria\nAnother interesting finding was the striking enhancement of the relative abundance of Clostridium clusters in the gut of FIR-irradiated mice (Fig. 3C). These clusters are known to produce SCFAs, especially for butyrate [16\u201318]. The enrichment of Clostridia clusters was further confirmed through the qPCR assays with the species-specific primers (Table 1) (Fig. 3D). Remarkably, the FIR-induced effects sustained 25\u00a0days from the initial FIR exposure (Fig. 3C and D). We also examined and compared the relative levels of SCFAs-producing bacteria based on the presence of the gene sequences that are involved in the SCFAs synthesis pathways. Using sets of specific degenerate PCR primers, we conducted qPCR on three relevant gene sequences in the terminal steps of SCFAs synthesis, i.e., butyrate transferase (But), butyrate kinase (BuK) and malonyl\u2010CoA decarboxylase (MatA). The results showed that the relative levels of all three gene sequences were elevated in FIR-treated mice compared to the control, and the elevated level was detectible at least until D25 (Fig. 4\nA).\n\n\nFIR upregulated key GPCR genes in mice\nOne of the important biological effects of SCFAs is the activation of various host\u2019s GPCRs and influence an array of cellular responses to the benefits of the host\u2019s health [19]. GPCRs are expressed at the surface of the gut epithelial cells, play essential roles in promoting gut homeostasis, and regulating inflammatory responses [20]. Bacterial metabolites, such as SCFAs, bind to the GPCRs as ligands and mimic the host signaling molecules [21]. We found upregulation of three main GPCRs genes, i.e., GPRs 41, 43, and 109a in the mice 24\u00a0h after the FIR exposure (Fig. 4B).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nFIR application is growing in various biomedical fields and health providers, yet there is no measurable parameter to assess its beneficial effects. GM is known to play an essential role in host metabolism and immunity; and, any event-induced perturbation in this community imposes direct implication on the host\u2019s health [22]. Therefore, make GM a potential biological system to assess the unknown healing abilities of FIR. In this study, we evaluated FIR effects on GM diversity and composition in C57BL\/6J mice. Also, the observed microbial changes were associated with the expression of GPCR encoding genes. It is worth mentioning that the EFFit Pen emitting radiation can be gaged and delivered to a confined area of the mouse abdomen in our study.\nIn this study, we showed that several potential pathogenic bacteria were significantly reduced in mice upon FIR radiation. The genus Mycoplasma under Tenericutes constitutes several mucosal pathogenic bacteria that can cause acute infection in the host [14]. On the other hand, another genus Anaeroplasma from Tenericutes remained at high abundance in the FIR-exposed mice on D25. Anaeroplasma is considered a potential new probiotic genus against chronic inflammatory diseases. This group of bacteria possesses anti-inflammatory properties by inducing cytokine TGF-\u03b2 and improves the intestinal barrier by enhancing mucosal IgA in mice [23]. Similarly, the FIR radiation inhibited the growth of family Deferribacteraceae and genus Mucispirillum. Mucispirillum sp. is a mucus degrading bacterium and can trigger spontaneous colitis in mice [24].\nAmong the FIR-induced beneficial bacteria, we observed instantaneous growth of Barnesiella spp, Alistipes massiliensis, Clostridium indolis, Prevotella spp., and Barnesiella intestinihominis in FIR-D1 (Fig. 3A). Apart from Barnesiella, the growth of these groups of bacteria sustained or even further propagated on D25 (Fig. 3B). Prevotella can degrade the undigested polysaccharide, improve the host\u2019s glucose metabolism, and plays an important role in energy homeostasis [25]. Species belonged to the genus Barnesiella are common dwellers in the human gut and protect the host against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis\n[26]. In addition, Barnesiella species could help host against obesity as these species are found abundantly in the gut of normal weight compared to the obese people [27]. In another experiment, Everard et al., (2011) found that prebiotics-induced Barnesiella spp. improved leptin sensitivity and metabolic parameters in ob\/ob mice [28]. Furthermore, Weiss et al. (2014) reported enhancement of Barnesiella spp. in mice fed with oligosaccharides 2-fucosyllactose-derivatives and 3-fucosyllactose-derivatives [29].\n\nAlistipes bacteria are essential for the efficacy of dietary therapy against Crohn\u2019s disease. The prevalence of Alistipes sp., Barnesiella spp., and Prevotella spp. have been correlated with the production of monosaccharides and short-chain fatty acids [30]. Another bacterium Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum remained elevated in FIR-treated mice on D25. This bacterium is a butyrate-producing bacterium with anti-colitis properties by strengthening the epithelium function [31]. We noticed the prevalence of Helicobacter ganmani in FIR treated mice. This bacterium, although belongs to a pathogenic genus, is unable to induce typhlitis in laboratory mice [32]. In addition to the data obtained from 16S sequencing, we verified the enhancement of SCFAs-producing bacteria by qPCR analysis of three main Clostridia clusters IV, XIV, and XIVa and the genes encoded enzymes in the SCFAs synthetic pathways, especially butyrate (Figs. 3E and 4A). Butyrate is an energy source for colonocytes and has been reported for anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties [21].\nInterestingly, some of the FIR-induced changes in the Clostridia clusters were long-lasting. In addition, we also evaluated SCFAs sensing receptors (GPCRs) to evaluate whether FIR-modulated GM could impact mice physiology. Therefore, three genes encoding GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109 were evaluated and found upregulated in the mice exposed to FIR radiations.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur findings showed that transient FIR-radiation could induce long-lasting alterations of gut microbial composition. The study also revealed, for the first time, that the health benefit of FIR treatment might be in part through the modulation of GM and the responses of host\u2019s signaling mediators such as SCFA-sensing GPCRs.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\nAll Institutional and National Guidelines for the care and use of animals (mice) were followed.\n\n","50":"\n\nIntroduction\nIncreasing global warming has led to a coinciding increase in research on the key detrimental factors of heat stress (HS) affecting animal welfare, livestock production, and human health.Increased temperatures above the normal limit or prolonged exposure to extreme environmental temperatures reduces cell viability when cellular defense mechanisms are not sufficient to withstand against this stress [1].\nLiving organisms react to hyperthermia through up-and-down regulation of genes correlated with cell defense against the detrimental effects of cellular protein denaturation and cytoskeleton disorganization [2]. Mostly, when exposed to heat stress, cells respond by a rapid and selective increase in heat shock proteins (HSPs) synthesis and by a dramatic reorganization of various cytoskeletal networks such as microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin microfilaments [3].The camel (Camelus dromedarius) is one of the largest xeric mammals that can survive in conditions of extreme dehydration and high temperatures for extended periods of time [4]. It increases the internal body temperature (Tb) to reach 43\u00a0\u00b0C during severe hot and dry conditions and dissipates this heat with the cold subjects to lower body temperature again [5]. Comparative genomics have predicted that the adaptability of camelids to xeric life conditions is due to unique lipid metabolism and stress responses to extreme environmental conditions [6].\nExtremely elevated temperatures cause damaging effects on metabolic machinery, such as inhibition of enzymes\u2019 catalytic activities, single and double-stranded DNA breaks and mutations, in addition to inhibition of DNA repair pathways [7]. Furthermore, apoptosis and necrosis may occur to somatic cells, such as Jurkat cells, at 44\u00a0\u00b0C and 46\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively [1]. Researchers have suggested that cellular responses to acute and chronic thermal stresses are different [8]. Clearly, prolonged exposure of cells to heat shock disrupted the cell morphology, and caused apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis [9,10]. Preliminary results indicate clear resistance by camel cells, suggesting unique cellular defense mechanisms following prolonged exposure to lethal heat.\nObservations showed a mutual relationship between cell survival and the induction of heat shock proteins. Cells that produce excessive heat shock proteins at high temperatures will combat both thermal and oxidative stress and sustain viability [1].\nCollective evidences revealed that dying cells can recover following apoptosis and ferroptosis in a process called \u201canastasis\u201d [11]. Anastasis is a term coined to outline the process of cell recovery or cellular resurrection from the brink of cell death [12].\nRecently, we showed different thermotolerance capabilities between camel somatic cells and oocyte [10]. Moreover, we showed the different durability against chronic heat shock among different somatic cells of camels [13]. The impetus of the current study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling thermotolerance of camel somatic cells after exposure to acute (45\u00a0\u00b0C\/2\u00a0h) or chronic heat stress (45\u00a0\u00b0C\/20\u00a0h), which is a lethal temperature for most of mammalian cells [1]. This study provides a paradigm for strategies of cellular thermotolerance, which can provide better explanation of the unique characteristics of camel cells.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nChemicals\nChemicals and culture media were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nGranulosa cell culture\nCells were obtained from camel ovaries. Ovaries were collected after routine animal slaughter at a local abattoir in Riyadh city. There was no member of the research team involved in pre-slaughter live animal handling or in the process of slaughtering. Ovaries were then transported to the laboratory within 4 to 6\u00a0h in a warm normal saline solution (30 to 33\u00a0\u00b0C). Antral follicles (2\u20138\u00a0mm in diameter) contents were collected using 10\u00a0mL disposable syringe. Cumulus-oocytes complexes were excluded from the follicular fluid contents under stereomicroscope using sterilized Pasteur pipette. Primary culture of granulosa cells was performed in 4-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences, Franklin lakes, NJ, USA). The culture medium consisted of Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1\u00a0mg\/mL gentamycin. Cells were cultured at 38\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 2\u00a0days. Culture medium was changed every 2\u00a0days until the cells reached 90% confluency. Primary culture of porcine granulosa cells were kindly provided by Dr. Goo Jang from Seoul National University, South Korea, and were handled similarly as camel granulosa cells.\n\n\nHeat exposure and examination of cell viability\nCells were distributed into six 4-well dishes (viable cell count of 10.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\/mL). Following the cellular attachment, culture dishes were exposed to one of the following conditions: (1) incubation at 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h (acute exposure), followed by 38\u00a0\u00b0C for recovery; (2) incubation at 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0h (chronic exposure), followed by 38\u00a0\u00b0C for recovery. Each treatment was accompanied with a control group which was initially cultured at 38\u00a0\u00b0C. Time-lapse imaging was performed using JuLITM Live Cell Movie analyzer (NanoEnTek Inc., Seoul, Korea). All control, heat shock and time-lapse experiments were performed using humid humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 (ThermoFisher Sci., Waltham, MA, USA) of For revealing the role of TGF\u03b2 pathway during the chronic heat stress, we treated the cells with TGF\u03b2 pathway inhibitor SB-431542 of dose 20\u00a0\u00b5M [14] during the exposure to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0h. Following the treatments, cells were collected by trypsinization and washing in PBS, and finally suspended in 1\u00a0mL PBS. Equal amounts of cell suspension and trypan blue solution (0.4% solution in PBS) were gently mixed, loaded into a hemocytometer and examined under a microscope at low magnification. The ratios of dead cells (blue-stained) to total cells were recorded. The experiment was repeated five times, and the values were recorded as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM.\n\n\nMeasurements of oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione)\nMalondialdehyde (MDA), the lipid peroxide, and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were measured in the conditioned medium of five replicates using colorimetric methods. For MDA, thiobarbituric acid was allowed to react with MDA in an acidic medium at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The absorbance of this resulting reaction was measured at a wavelength of 534\u00a0nm. GSH level measurement was based on the reduction of 5,5\u2032 dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) by glutathione to produce a reduced yellow compound which is directly proportional to GSH concentrations. The absorbance of the resulted chromogen was measured at a wavelength of 405\u00a0nm.\n\n\nRelative quantitative PCR (qPCR)\nCells (three replicates) were trypsinized, washed in PBS and collected with centrifugation at 1000 xg for 2\u00a0min. RNA was extracted from cell pellets using a total RNA extraction Kit (Intron Biotech, Seoul, Korea). RNA concentration and purity were estimated by NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer(Thermo Fisher). Pulsed reverse transcription (RT) was performed according to Mestdagh et al. [15] with some modifications [10]: 120 cycles of 16\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min, 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, and 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0s, followed by final inactivation at 85\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. RT reactions were comprised of 50\u00a0ng of total RNA, and 5\u00a0\u00b5M of random hexamers in a 40\u00a0\u00b5L total reaction volume using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Relative quantitative real-time PCR was performed using automated thermal cycler (ViiA 7, Applied Biosystems). Reactions comprised of 100\u00a0ng of cDNA, 1\u00a0\u00b5M forward and reverse primers, and 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SYBR Green premix (Applied Biosystems). House-keeping gene GAPDH was used for normalization and the fold-change of the target transcripts were calculated through the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method. cDNA template-negative samples and reactions without RT resulted in no amplification in all assays. Thermal cycling conditions were 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s, 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0s, and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 40\u00a0s. Details of primers used to amplify the target transcripts are listed in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n\n\nShotgun proteomics analysis\n\nPreparation of cell protein lysate\nCollected cells were quickly washed with cold PBS supplemented with a protease and phosphatases inhibitors (complete ultra-tablets, mini, Roche, Mannheim) to suppress any possible protease activity such as that of phosphofructokinase. Protein was extracted from the cells by combining approximately 200\u00a0\u03bcL (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104) of cells with 1\u00a0mL lysis solution (8\u00a0M urea, 500\u00a0mM Tris HCl, pH 8.5) and complete ultra-protease inhibitor (Roche, Mannheim). After incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h with occasional vortex, samples were centrifuged at 12,000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min. Acetone was used to precipitate the lysate and was measured through the BCA method (Pierce, Rockford IL) at \u00c5562 nm prior to digestion.\n\n\nPreparation of tryptic digest\nThirty \u00b5g of cell protein lysate from each sample was subjected to digestion in solution. In brief, protein pellets were suspended in 8\u00a0M urea lysis solution and reduced with 5\u00a0mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) for 30\u00a0min. Alkylation of cysteine residues were performed with 10\u00a0mM iodoacetamide for 30\u00a0min in the dark. Prior to digestion with trypsin, samples were diluted to a final concentration of 2\u00a0M urea with 100\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. A modified procaine trypsin (Sigma, Germany) was added at ratio of 50:1 (protein: protease mass) along with 1\u00a0mM CaCl2 and incubated overnight in a thermo-shaker at 600\u00a0rpm and 37\u00a0\u00b0C for endopeptidase digestion. The digested peptide solution was acidified using 90% formic acid to a final pH of 2.0. The resultant peptide mixture was cleaned using stage tip and quantified as discussed previously [16]. Each sample was run in triplicate.\n\n\nNano-LC MS\/MS analysis\nNano-LC MS\/MS analysis was conducted using a TripleTOF 5600 + (AB Sciex, Canada) connected at the front end with a Eksigent nanoLC 400 autosampler with Ekspert nanoLC 425 pump. Peptides were trapped on a CHROMXP C18CL 5\u00a0\u00b5m column (10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0mm) (Sciex, Germany) on trap and elute mode. MS and MS\/MS ranges were 400\u20131250\u00a0m\/z and 170\u20131500\u00a0m\/z, respectively. Samples were eluted on a 55-minute linear gradient 3\u201340% solution (80% ACN, 0.2% formic acid). The 40 most intense ions were sequentially selected in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode with a 2\u20135 charge state. Surveys of full scan MS and MS\/MS spectra were estimated at resolutions of 35.000 and 15.000, respectively. External calibration was scheduled and run during sample batches to correct possible TOF deviation to ensure the analysis accuracy.\n\n\nProteomics data analysis\nMascot generic format (mgf) files were generated from raw files using a script supplied by AB Sciex. MS\/MS spectra were analyzed using\u00a0X\u00a0Tandem in Peptide shaker (version 1.16.26) against the Camelus UniProtKB\/TrEMBL database (462 entries) with reversed decoy sequences. The search space included all fully and semi-tryptic peptide candidates (containing up to 2 missed cleavages with at least 6 amino acids). Precursor mass and fragment mass were identified with an initial mass tolerance of 20\u00a0ppm and 10\u00a0ppm, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.02146 amu) was considered a static modification and oxidation of Methionine (+15.995), acetylation of protein N- terminal and K (+42.01\u00a0amu), and pyrrolidone from carbamidomethylation C (\u221217.03\u00a0amu) as variable modification. To ensure high quality results, the false discovery rate (FDR) was kept at 1% at the protein level. Final assembly of sample replicates was applied to generate final outputs for each sample and normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) normalization was used to compare the protein abundance as fold-change between the samples according to Gokce et al. [17]. Total ion chromatography (TIC) and Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) were also performed for cells exposed to acute and chronic thermal stress and represented in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Detailed analysis of proteomics are shown in Supplementary Excel files 1 and 2 for acute and chronic heat shock, respectively.\n\n\nCytochalasin B treatment and wound healing\nCells were randomly allocated into three treatments: cells incubated at 45\u00a0\u00b0C treated with or without 0.5\u00a0mg\/ml cytochalasin B (CB), and cells were incubated at 38\u00a0\u00b0C and treated with CB for two hours. After removal of CB, cells were microscopically examined to determine the effect of CB on morphology and then were subjected to a scratch healing assay following our recent report [10]. In brief, granulosa cells from the three treatments were distributed in 35\u00a0mm dishes and cultured until confluent. The cell monolayers were then scraped in a straight line with sterile 1000-microliter blue pipette tips to create a wound, washed with culture medium to remove debris at the edge of the scratch. Culture medium was replaced with 2\u00a0mL and the dishes were then incubated at 38\u00a0\u00b0C in humid atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell growth and wound healing was assessed by capturing images and measuring the mean distance between the wound edges with ImageJ 1.50i software (NIH, USA).\n\n\nROCK-inhibitor Y-27632 treatment and wound healing\nCells were randomly allocated into three treatments: cells incubated at 45\u00a0\u00b0C with or without 10\u00a0\u00b5M ROCK-inhibitor Y-27632 (RI) treatment, or incubated at 38\u00a0\u00b0C and treated with RI for two hours. After removal of RI, cells were microscopically examined and then subjected to a wound healing assay as previously described. Cell growth and wound healing were assessed as previously mentioned.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nValues were presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM. Cell replication values were analyzed using ANOVA. Quantitative PCR results were compared by Student T-test. Significant statistical differences were considered when P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05. Normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) and protein expression alteration (fold changes), log values, and confidence were calculated based on spectral peak intensities generated from the mass spectrometric analysis after extracting confident protein spectra with\nP\u00a0<\u00a00.05 [18]. Results were considered as non- significant if P value was higher than earlier indicated value. Proteomics data analysis and associated illustrations were performed using R language unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nImpact of heat shock on camel cell morphology\nCells exposed to acute heat shock (45\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h) retained their normal spindle shape with no other observed morphological changes (Fig. 1\nB). However, chronic heat shock significantly distorted the cell morphology. Cells in the control group and during the pre-exposure period were characterized by spindle shape and ovoid nuclei (Fig. 1A). Moreover, cells showed temporal morphological changes after exposure to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 5, 10, and 20\u00a0h. Cells became polygonal after 5\u00a0h of exposure, and then cells lost the cellular matrix and spindle shape gradually (Fig. 1C\u2013E, respectively). Cells became spherical shape with spherical nuclei (Fig. 1F) and stopped the cell motility (Supplemental Video 1). Moreover, dead cells were suspended in the culture medium. Cells retained to rounded shape and gradually regained the cellular matrix, spindle shape, and motile or migratory activity after recovery at 38\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 1G and Supplemental Video 1 and 2). Unlike camel cells, porcine cells were unable to retain the orginal morphology before the heat shock and cells undewent collapse and degenrative morphology at the ending of exposure to chronic heat shock (Supplemental Video 3).\n\n\nProteomic profiling of heat shocked cells\u2019 proteins\nThe total number of proteins identified during acute heat shock exposure was higher than in the control sample (391 vs. 321, respectively). While, there was a significant decrease (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) in the number of identified proteins in chronic heat shocked cells compared with control as well as recovered cells (178 vs. 613, and 327, respectively). The relative low number of proteins identified is due to the small database of Arabian camel proteins (Swissprot; 35 proteins, TrEMBL; 427). Comparison between the experimental groups showed that 137 proteins were unique to acute heat-shocked cells, while 67 proteins were unique to the control group (Fig. 2\nA). Similarly, 13 proteins were unique to the chronic heat-shocked cells and 48 proteins only appeared in the cells after recovery at 38\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h (Fig. 2B). Proteomics analysis also showed slight differences between the number of associated peptides and peptide spectrum match (PSM) in both acute and chronic heat shocked cells (Fig. 2C and D, respectively). Fig. 3\n, shows the top 20 significantly dysregulated proteins reported in heat map in both acute and chronic heat-shocked cells. Total ion chromatography (TIC) and Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) of cells after recovery from chronic heat shock showed prominent expression of heat shock protein 1 reported in cells recovered at 38\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 4\n). Details of the uniquely expressed proteins are discussed below. Further details on the full proteome profiles of all experimental groups can be found in Supplementary Excel Files 1 and 2. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [19] partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD012159. Detailed results of the proteomics are illustrated below within the discussion of some selected pathways.\n\n\nImpact of heat shock on mRNA transcripts expression\nExposure of cells to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h showed that HSP70 and HSP90 transcripts increased 10-fold and 7-fold, respectively (Fig. 5\n). However, no significant alteration in BAX, BCL2, P53, and ACTB expression after acute heat shock exposure (Fig. 5). TGFB, ACTA2, TAGLN, and TPM1 mRNA transcripts showed significant decrease in heat-shocked cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 5)\n\n\nRole of actin polymerization during acute heat shock\nWe therefore, examined the effect of heat shock on the cytoskeleton by suppressing actin polymerization with cytochalasin B (CB) [20] during acute heat shock. Untreated cells exposed to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h showed no morphological changes. However, cells treated with CB during heat shock (45\u00a0\u00b0C) exhibited severe cellular shrinkage (Fig. 6\nE) compared to cells treated with CB and exposed to 38\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 6D). Two hours after removal of CB, cell morphology returned to the normal pre-exposure form, but the cells still exhibited cytoplasmic retractions (Fig. 6). Moreover, heat shocked cells treated with CB showed reduced cellular movement and healing of cell scratches after recovery at 38\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h (Fig. 7\n) compared to cells treated with CB and exposed to 38\u00a0\u00b0C or exposed to heat shock without CB treatment.\n\n\nRole of Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCKs) in acute heat shock\nInterestingly, treatment of cells with Y-27632, a specific selective inhibitor ofRho-associated protein kinases (ROCKs), exaggerated the effect of acute heat shock (45\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h) on cultured cells. Cells showed cytoplasmic retractions and shrinkage and turned into star-shape (Fig. 8\n). Moreover, the ROCK inhibitor (RI) Y-27632 retarded wound healing of cells exposed to the acute heat shock (Fig. 9\n) more than CB treatment (Fig. 7); wound width was 525.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034.2 vs. 790.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.3 in CB and RI, respectively.\n\n\nRole of transforming growth factor pathway in chronic heat stress\nWe hypothesized that the TGF\u03b2 pathway, which is related to cytoskeleton organization, might be involved in the morphological changes associated with the cellular response to chronic heat shock. Interestingly, supplementation of the culture medium with SB-431542 (a TGF\u03b2 pathway inhibitor) maintained the spindle morphology of the heat-tolerant cells (Fig. 10\n) when compared with non-supplemented cells. Cells resumed replication after 120\u00a0h of recovery as illustrated in Fig. 1D\u2013G.\n\n\nImpact of heat shock on oxidative stress, anti-oxidative defense, apoptosis and cell viability\nAcute exposure of cells to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h showed no effect on malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; however, chronic exposure to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0h increased MDA over its level after 2\u00a0h of exposure (3.88\u00a0nM\/mL vs. 3.02\u00a0nM\/mL, respectively, P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). In contrast, GSH levels increased significantly after acute exposure to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h (145.2\u00a0mM\/L vs. 126.4\u00a0mM\/L, P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) with no difference at the end of chronic exposure for 20\u00a0h (Table 1\n).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe current study revealed the molecular mechanism of the camel cells to manage and recover from acute and chronic heat shock and showed the adaptability of camel somatic cells to conserve life under extremely hot conditions. The disturbed architecture of camel cells exposed to extremely chronic heat shock (45\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0h) might be indicative of a special cellular re-structural response by camel cells. Similar morphological changes were reported in rat intestinal cells exposed to 42\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h [9] and amoebacells exposed to acute heat shock at 34\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min [21]. Notably, after recovery at 38\u00a0\u00b0C, the morphological changes were gradually disappeared, and the camel cells returned to their normal spindle morphology and migratory activity, which indicates a unique feature of camel cells resilience and plasticity that has not been reported for other mammalian cells.\nProteomics results showed that the level of nuclear receptor coactivator 2 increased 2-fold (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) in acute heat shocked cells. Nuclear receptor coactivator 2 is involved in protein dimerization, intracellular receptor signaling, and regulation of DNA transcription as a cellular defense against the protein denaturation associated with heat shock [22]. A significant decrease in leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 59 was observed in acute heat shocked cells. This might be associated with reduced RNA trafficking and binding to the ribosomes and a pause of ribosome translation that occurs with heat shock [23,24]. Interestingly, chronic heat shock altered several proteins in the experimental groups (Fig. 3B and D). Coatomer subunit delta, Ras-related protein Rab-6A helicase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X were all significantly elevated by chronic heat shock and were not detected in control cells. These proteins are responsible for intracellular protein transport, retrograde vesicle-mediated transport Golgi to ER, and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity, a response reflecting the protein turnover stimulated by heat shock. Moreover, the heat shock and recovery stages induced eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-II which is involved in the cellular response to osmotic stress and stress granule assembly. These four proteins maintained their elevated expression after recovery from chronic heat shock. Similarly, chronic heat shock induced proteins such as nuclear receptor coactivator 2 previously discussed in the acute heat shock. In addition, it uniquely induced expression of transmembrane channel-like protein and histone-lysine N-methyltransferase MLL4 which regulate calcium ion transmembrane transport and transcription. The levels of these three proteins steeply decreased during the recovery stage and so may be induced by chronic heat shock (Supplementary Excel File 2).\nDuring acute heat shock, results of qPCR showed no significant alteration in ACTB expression (Fig. 5) and similarly proteomics results showed non-significant decrease in the level of beta-actin (0.5-fold) after exposure to acute heat shock (Supplementary Table 2). This result might indicate a high turnover of the beta actin protein during heat shock or suggests the existence of another supportive pathway to maintain the cytoskeleton integrity (Fig. 1B). Two hours after removal of CB, cell morphology returned to the normal pre-exposure form [25], but the cells still exhibited cytoplasmic retractions which indicate that cytoskeleton integrity during heat shock, particularly dynamic actin polymerization, is involved in the cellular defense against acute heat shock.\nFurthermore, the current results indicate additional essential roles of the ROCKs pathway not only in maintaining actin polymerization and the cell cytoskeleton but also for actomyosin activity [26,27] as a mean of defense against acute heat shock. This finding coincides with the results reported by Ramachandran et al. (2011) who found that RI treatment resulted in the loss of stress fibers and caused cellular shrinkage and stellate appearance of the cells [28]. Digging the Rho signaling pathway through proteomics (Supplementary Table 4) revealed that spetins (spetin 2, 7 and 9) disappeared after acute heat shock. Septins connect to Cdc42 effectors, Borg proteins, and are involved in cytokinesis and cell division, which could explain the delay in wound healing by RI-treated acute heat shocked cells [29]. On the other hand, there was no change in cofilin-1 after acute heat shock, suggesting the maintenance of actin polymerization [30] during the response against heat shock. Conversely, most Rho-associated proteins (such as septins, F-actin, myosin heavy chain, transforming protein RhoA, and Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1) were absent; in addition, the extreme reduction (3-fold) of cofilin-1 after chronic heat shock (Supplementary Table 5) indicated the loss of stress fibers and actomyosin integrity and may account for the observed morphology of cells after chronic heat shock (Fig. 1D\u2013F). Cytoskeletal actin and stress fibers are not static and can easily change cell morphology by assembling or disassembling themselves [31]. Moreover, tubulin polymerization is susceptible to temperature change; early experiments revealed that most microtubules in animal cells disassemble when the cells are cooled to 4\u00a0\u00b0C and reassemble when the cells are rewarmed to 37\u00a0\u00b0C, and these changes are regulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) [31].\nAlthough, qPCR results demonstrated that acute heat shock caused no alteration in ACTB expression, it significantly decreased (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) the expression of TGF\u0392, ACTA2, TGLN, and TPM1 (Fig. 5). Although we noticed a reduction in the expression of TGF\u03b2 and its pathway (actinin 2, transgelin, and tropomyosin) transcripts, the acute effects of elevated temperature were not clearly reflected on the proteomics level (Supplementary Table 2). Most probably, effects on the protein level might require more time as evidenced in the chronic heat shock results (Supplementary Table 3). Meanwhile, Flanders et al. showed that hyperthermia (41.5\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h) was associated with TGF\u03b2 induction at the mRNA and protein levels in cardiac rat cells as a cardioprotective effect of heat shock [32]. In the current study, supplementation of the culture medium with SB-431542 maintained the spindle morphology of heat-exposed cells with no effect on cell replication after 120\u00a0h of recovery. TAGLN, ACTA2, and TPM1 are TGF\u03b2-inducible genes and are required for actin cytoskeleton organization and cellular differentiation [33], but their involvement in cellular morphological acclimation to heat stress is not known. SB-431542 specifically inhibits the activin receptor-like kinase activity of ALK-4, ALK-5, and ALK-7 [34]. Studies have shown that supplementation with a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist (recombinant T\u03b2RII\u2044Fc chimera) ameliorated the heat-induced blood-testis-barrier disruption, which reflected the involvement of TGF\u0392 expression in heat-induced morphological changes in the testis [35]. We propose that the TGF\u03b2 pathway might be involved in the disruption of cellular architecture and this impact can be alleviated through inhibition of the TGF\u03b2 pathway. Our results coincide with those of Wang et al. [36], who found around 2- to 4-fold reduction in transgelin (TAGLN) expression in chicken testis after acute heat shock, while they contradict the results of He et al. [37] who found a 1.6-fold increase in rat intestinal TAGLN expression after acute heat shock (41\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h). These two results are conflicting probably because the internal core body temperature of chicken and rats differs and both are different from the in vitro conditions in this study. Additionally, several proteins involved in the TGF\u03b2 pathway and expressed during heat shock maintained altered expression levels after recovery (Supplementary Table 6); A-kinase anchor protein 12, mastermind-like protein, actinin 2, transgelin, and serpin showed\u00a0~\u00a00.5-fold decrease after chronic heat shock, while tropomyosin 1 showed no alteration after chronic heat shock. Interestingly, these changes were partially restored during the recovery stage particularly serpin and mastermind-like protein levels which increased by 2-fold and 1.5-fold respectively, when compared to their levels after heat shock (Supplementary Table 7).\nChronic heat shock diminished proteins associated with cytoskeletal integrity such as integrin alpha V, fermitin, moesin, clathrin, dynein, and plastin-2, all of which are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization and they reappeared after cell recovery at 38\u00a0\u00b0C. Additionally, the protein talin, which is associated with actin binding, disappeared after chronic heat shock and did not return during the recovery stage. Importantly, galectin levels markedly decreased after chronic heat shock and recovery by 4- and 7-fold, respectively, (Supplementary Table 3) when compared with expression in control cells, suggesting the loss of integrin binding and subsequently low cellular adhesion [38].\nMoreover, proteomics results showed that during acute heat shock expressed cell adhesion protein integrin alpha V (Supplementary Table 2), paradoxically however chronic heat shock inhibited integrin alpha V (Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, during the recovery stage there was a decrease (0.25-fold) in elongation factor 2 (Fig. 3), which aids in actin filament binding, cadherin binding, and is involved in the response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, lamin-B1, which is a component of the nuclear lamina and provides a framework for the nuclear envelope and may also interact with chromatin, also decreased (0.5-fold) during recovery. Interestingly, beta-actin expression increased 1.7-fold during the recovery stage compared with heat shocked cells (Supplementary Table 3). Some proteins disappeared during chronic heat shock and resumed their expression during the recovery stage including integrin alpha V, moesin, clathrin, dynein, and plastin-2 which are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Additionally, the protein talin, which is associated with actin binding disappeared after chronic heat shock and was not regained during recovery. Some proteins were induced by heat shock and maintained their expression during the recovery stage including heat shock protein 6, which is involved in protein folding and alpha-crystallin, which had a 3.2-fold increase during the recovery stage and is responsible for nuclear and cytoplasm structure (Supplementary Table 3).\nIt is well known that heat shock is considered as an oxidative stress. Shotgun proteomic profiling pinpointed a significant increase in glutathione S-transferase mu and P1-1 (1.6- and 3.3-fold, respectively) (Supplementary Table 2) after acute heat shock. Additionally, after recovery from chronic heat shock, cells resumed their expression of both enzymes (Supplementary Table 3), as a cellular defense to the increased level of MDA caused by chronic heat shock (Table 1). This response is essential to prevent intracellular damage caused byreactive oxygen speciesand as a powerful defense against lipid peroxidation and the breakdown of xenobiotics [39,40]. Exposure to heat for 2\u00a0h inhibited cell proliferation for 24\u00a0h, then cells gained their ability to proliferate and reached confluence at 96\u00a0h post heat stress. Afterwards, the cells behaved in a similar matter to those in the control group (Fig. 1H). This result confirms the finding of Figs. 7 and 9 because heat shocked cells (non-treated with CB or RI) showed reduced the wound healing capability compared with those cultured at 38\u00a0\u00b0C. Conversely, prolonged heat stress decreased the viability (living cells were reduced to 32% compared to 100% pre-exposure) and proliferation of cells for 48\u00a0h post heat stress (Fig. 1C). These cells resumed replication 144\u00a0h post heat stress but did not reach confluence until 240\u00a0h post-exposure (data not shown). As we show below, and in accordance with the MIQE guidelines [41], chronic heat shock significantly decreased Gapdh and actin-\u03b2 proteins and therefore we did not perform real-time PCR analysis for the chronic heat shocked cells and only showed the results of the proteomics profile. Further investigations are required to determine which housekeeping genes are not altered by chronic heat shock and can be used as reference controls for relative quantification of mRNA transcripts.\nInterestingly, P53, BAX and BCL2 transcripts as well as the BAX\/BCL2 ratio showed no change after acute heat shock (Fig. 5). Among the unique proteins that were found as a response to the acute heat shock (Supplementary Table 2), were some associated with apoptosis and autophagy such as 26S protease regulatory subunit 6A, 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 5 isoform 1, cathepsin D, cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1, cytochrome c, nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 isoform 2, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase, proliferation-associated protein 2G4, proteasome subunit beta, and Ras-related protein Rab-2A, suggesting a cellular response to the short-term exposure to heat shock through apoptosis and autophagy (Supplementary Excel File 1). We propose that cells respond to acute heat shock by brief arrest in cell cycle to permit the corrections of cellular damage caused by the heat shock. Additionally, prohibitin-2 increased 1.5-fold during chronic heat shock and 2-fold during the recovery stage (Supplementary Excel File 2), indicating the mitophagy stimulation was a response to the heat shock injury [42].\nMoreover, acute heat shocked cells also expressed unique proteins associated with protein folding such as DNA damage-binding protein 1, heat shock 70\u00a0kDa protein 4, heat shock protein 70 A1B, and heat shock protein 90, as well as proteins involved in ubiquitination such as ubiquitin thioesterase and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Excel File 1). Heat shock proteins are chaperones cause partial unfolding or protein aggregation that protect cells from the detrimental thermal and oxidative stress [43]. Hsp70 and other HSPs bind to hydrophobic residues exposed by stress and prevent partially denatured proteins from aggregation and allow them to refold [44]. Furthermore, HSPs stabilize and protect actin microfilaments when organized in small, phosphorylated oligomers [3]. Chronic heat shock significantly (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) increased chaperons levels including endoplasmin (Hsp90b1), heat shock protein 70 A1B, heat shock protein 90, and heat shock protein beta-1 compared to control cells by 1.35-, 1.45-, 1.54-, and 1.7-fold respectively. Heat shock protein 70 1A and heat shock protein 70 1L increased during the recovery stage compared with their levels in heat shocked cells (1.4-fold of both) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Excel File 2). Interestingly Hsp70 (heat shock protein 1) elevated dramatically in the recovery stage. Fig. 4 shows an obvious peak of Hsp70 through TIC and IDA analysis that indicates the essential roles of chaperones during the stage of recovery for protein refolding and corrections of misfolding that were associated with the chronic heat shock. We propose that maintaining high levels of Hsp70 during the exposure to such high temperature is the major cell machinery required for protection of cellular proteins from the damaging thermal stress. In addition, upregulation of Hsp70 during recovery may also suppress DNAase activity associated with chronic heat shock [12,45] and may also share in the cell cycle arrest [45] that was found in our results to allow the DNA repair. Conversely, PCR results showed that acute heat shock did not affect the expression of P53, BAX, and BCL2 (Fig. 4). Apoptosis can be inhibited with Hsp70 via blocking the binding of procaspase-9 to the cytochrome c apoptosome complex [46]. Moreover, Hsp70 augments the glutathione reductase activity to reduce glutathione disulfide into sulfhydryl form of glutathione (GSH). This interplay augments the cytoprotective effects of Hsp70 and the cellular redox environment in response to stress [47]. Camel somatic cells mitigate the impacts of acute heat shock by increasing the expression of heat shock proteins and GSH levels. This observation is in accordance with earlier genomic studies which illustarated the adaptation of camel genome to extreme environmental heat [6]. Additionally, chronic heat shock induced the expression of other chaperons such as HSP6 (Supplementary Table 3), serine\/threonine-protein phosphatase, and nuclear receptor co-activator-2 (Fig. 3D), which were maintained during the recovery stage. Moreover, during the recovery stage chaperon proteins associated with protein folding such as protein disulfide-isomerase A6 increased (1.5-fold) when compared to the heat shock stage (Fig. 3).\nHeat shock and recovery also selectively evoked some proteins associated with metabolic pathways such as ADP\/ATP translocase 4, which exchanges cytosolic ADP for mitochondrial synthesized ATP. It uniquely induced dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase which is involved in fatty acid oxidation, lipoprotein catabolism and proteolysis [48]. Additionally, chronic heat shock uniquely induced proteins associated with nucleic acid metabolism and protein translation such as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 and non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein. Moreover, 60S ribosomal protein L13 increased during recovery by 2.2-fold compared with the levels during heat shock (Supplementary Excel File 2). Our finding clearly show that acute heat shock uniquely induced some metabolic proteins associated with ATP synthesis such as ATP synthase protein 8 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3. Moreover, acute heat shock increased levels of DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase (1.5-fold), a DNA repair enzyme. Similarly, gene ontology studies showed altered protein pathways in chronic heat shock and after recovery. For example, we reported that DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase which was expressed in heat shocked cells could not detected by mass spectrometry during the recovery stage. However, some metabolic proteins resumed their expression after recovery such as ATP synthase protein 8 and Na\/K ATPase (Supplementary Excel Files 1 and 2).\nThe morphological changes observed in the camel granulosa cell exposed to 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0h in this study (Figs. 1 and 10) were interesting and raise the possibility of cellular acclimation towards heat shock through an estivation-like state in the mammalian cells. Estivation is a process of thermotolerance, where many invertebrates enter a state of aerobic dormancy in response to extremely elevated environmental temperatures. This status characterized by hypometabolism associated with behavioral, physiological, and biochemical slackening. Such adaptation aim to conserve water, energy reserves, and to minimize detrimental effects to cellular machinery [49]. To confirm this hypothesis, further metabolomics studies are ongoing. Interestingly, our current results revealed that several metabolic enzymes were dysregulated after chronic heat shock, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase which is a main house-keeping gene in normal non-stressed cells [50]. Additionally, several metabolic proteins were not detected during chronic heat shock and were significantly elevated during the recovery stage such as ATP synthase and Na\/K ATPase (Supplementary Table 3, Fig. 11\n). This might indicate that a hypo-metabolic state occurred in the cells during chronic heat exposure to a temperature considered lethal to many other mammalian cells as part of an estivation-like state that we propose in the current model. The absence of Na\/K ATPase may also affect cell volume (as observed in Figs. 1 and 10) and increase the total amount of water contained in the cells during heat shock exposure [51]. The increased level of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase seen during chronic heat shock (Fig. 3D) indicates the dependence of the cells on the energy liberated from lipid and protein catabolism, which is associated with the current model for protection against lethal hyperthermia. Interestingly, estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 1, an enzyme required for estradiol metabolism in the granulosa cells, was among the proteins that were absent in chronically heat shocked cells (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Excel File 2), and were restored after recovery, confirming the metabolic dormancy state of chronically heat shocked cells. The link between the \u201cestivation-like state\u201d that we propose here and the newly introduced phenomenon of cellular recovery \u201canastasis\u201d or the cellular resurrection and reversal of cell death is interesting and requires further investigation.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe provide a molecular interpretation for the thermotolerance of camel granulosa cells. The common features of the cellular response to acute heat shock (45\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h) are increasing the expression of heat shock proteins and DNA repair enzymes. Whereas cells exposed to chronic heat shock (45\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0h) showed reduction in total protein levels, metabolic enzymes, and cytoskeletal proteins. These alterations were partially restored during the recovery stage after 24\u00a0h with an obvious increase in Hsp70 and then cells regained their normal cellular morphology on the 9th day of recovery (Fig. 11). The strategy of cellular defense and tolerance to both thermal conditions reflects the flexible adaptability of camel cells. The cellular resilience, plasticity and mechanism of recovery from chronic heat stress can be an example for understanding the interesting newly discussed phenomenon \u201canastasis\u201d [52]. This strategy would also provide a paradigm for interfering with the thermotolerant response of cells that may occur in certain diseases such as tumors [53].\n\n\nFunding\nThis study was supported by King Saud University, Deanship of Scientific Research, Research Group #RG-1438-018.

Meanwhile, it has been suggested that two or more histone modifications may form combinatorial HPTMs, which act as a recognition platform to recruit reader proteins and further regulate gene transcription [6\u20139]. For example, the methylation of lysine H3 and its adjacent phosphorylation (H3S10ph) can modulate the binding of hetero-chromatin protein 1 with histone H3 and thus alter chromosome alignment and segregation [10]. Therefore, the readers that display distinct binding abilities to different HPTMs play critical roles in translating the complex PTM codes to certain meaningful biological functions [8,9,11], including transcription, cell cycle progression, cell growth and differentiation, and apoptosis [12]. The majority of reader proteins can recognize combinatorial HPTMs by their multiple domains. For example, a trans-histone PTM platform that was formed by tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) and acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H4 (H4K16ac) to coordinately interact with the PHD finger and Bromodomain of BPTF [13]. Recently, a dual histone methyl-lysine binding module of SHORT LIFE was reported to recognize both tri-methylation on H3K4 and H3K27 via its BAH and PHD domains, respectively [14]. Moreover, tandem-domain-reader proteins not only lead to multivalent binding of the combinatorial histone modifications but also interact with nuclear proteins to form large multiprotein complexes, which are involved in many chromatin-dependent functions [6,12,15\u201317]. A further complication is the fact that the \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d coordinately interact with each other to reveal epigenetic codes [8,18]. Previous reports have indicated that the network of \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d is related to numerous diseases [19].\nCurrently, research on the interactions between HPTMs and proteins has developed rapidly, and most studies have been performed on the peptide level, such as peptide microarrays. However, the interactions are usually transient and characterized by modest tens-to-hundreds micromolar affinity [19,20]. Peptide microarrays are largely limited to peptides containing individual PTMs, and the integrity and spatial orientation of the peptides also have some nonspecific influence on the interaction [21]. Another popular technology, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based methods [22], has enabled the mapping and understanding of histone modifications at the genomic level. However, ChIP has also been limited by the weakness of the antibodies, which exhibit cross-reactivity and epitope closure [23,24]. Recently high throughput strategy based on the semi-synthesis of DNA-barcoded nucleosome libraries had been developed for screening the recruitment and modulation of HPTM binders, as well as known combinatorial HPTM crosstalks [25,26]. The method is very attractive, however the construction of analysis tool still has a high requirement in histone protein synthesis and the reassemble nucleosome. To date, more and more methods, such as surface plasmon resonance imaging technique [27] and NMR spectroscopy [28] have been implemented to profile readers of combinatorial HPTMs or to reveal their interactions. Notably, MS, as a more detailed, high-throughput, and unbiased method [29,30], plays important roles in the study of HPTMs and has promising potential to elucidate the communication of \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d.\nIn this work, we focused on several tandem-domain-reader proteins and analyzed their readout of HPTMs peptides and binding nucleoproteins to profile the complicated interactions between combinatorial HPTMs and tandem domains. The interactions were identified by MS, and then the binding abilities were quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In addition, tandem-domain proteins were used as probes to pull down the nucleoproteins. The interaction network of the histone PTMs-readers-binding complexes was analyzed by bioinformatics analysis. A schematic view of the work is provided in the supplemental information (Fig. S1). The results showed that four transcription-associated proteins, such as MBB1A, HELLS, PRKDC and TRRAP, could modify the histones alone or as a component of the complex. Finally, we constructed the network of \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d and revealed the molecular mechanism of the effects of tandem-domain protein-mediated histone crosstalk on epigenetic regulation.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nProtein expression and purification\nThe chromatin-associating domains from human BPTF (PHD-Bromo 8326\u20138832), human CBP (Bromo-PHD 4038\u20134745), human TAF1 (Bromo-Bromo 4033\u20134908), human TRIM24 (PHD-Bromo 2658\u20133341), and human TRIM33 (PHD-Bromo 2789\u20133511) were N-terminally fused to GST. All proteins were expressed in E. coli Rosetta and induced overnight by 1\u202fmM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside at 16\u2103 in LB medium supplemented with 50\u202fmM ZnCl2\n[13]. After cell lysis and centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to Glutatahione Sepharose 4B agarose (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, USA). The resultant plasmid sequences (BPTF-PB, CBP-BP, TRIM24-PB, TRIM33-PB, and TAF1-BB) are provided in the supplemental information (Figs. S8\u2013S12).\n\n\nPeptide pull-down\nAll histone peptides bearing combinational modifications were purchased from SciLight Biotechnology (China) and derived by chemical synthesis. The combinatorial HPTMs peptides were designed based on previous reports [1\u20134,31\u201334]. The peptide mixture was prepared by mixing equivalent amounts of different peptides. GST-tagged proteins were first attached to Glutatahione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, USA). After washing the beads five times (wash buffer, 50\u202fmM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150\u202fmM NaCl, 0.05% NP40), the peptide mixture was incubated with the beads. During the peptide pull-down, the peptide mixture (100\u202fmg\/ml, 5\u202f\u03bcl) was incubated with the GST-tagged proteins (10\u202fmg\/ml, 20\u202f\u03bcl). After incubation, all the beads were washed by wash buffer I two times (wash buffer I, 50\u202fmM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350\u202fmM NaCl, 0.5% NP40), and by wash buffer II three times (wash buffer II, 50\u202fmM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350\u202fmM NaCl, 0.05% NP40) to remove false positive binding peptides. Finally, 30% acetic acid was added, and the enriched peptides were eluted and detected by MALDI-TOF MS.\n\n\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis (MALDI-TOF)\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis was performed using Autoflex III TOF\/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany) (mass tolerance: \u22644\u202fppm). The measurements were conducted in reflex positive-ion mode with delayed ion extraction. Prior to analysis, the instrument was externally calibrated with a mixture of peptide standards. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) was used as the matrix for the analysis of peptides. Sample aliquots of 1.0\u202f\u00b5l were placed onto the MALDI plate. Then, 1.0\u202f\u00b5l of the DHB matrix was added and dried at room temperature. MS data were analyzed using Flexanalysis software (3.3.65.0) for spectral processing and peak detection.\n\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)\nFor ITC measurement, synthetic histone peptides (SciLight Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and proteins were extensively dialyzed against the ITC buffer: PBS (137\u202fmM NaCl, 2.7\u202fmM KCl, 10\u202fmM Na2HPO4, 2\u202fmM KH2PO4) (pH 6.5). During the ITC assay procedure, four GST tagged proteins (75\u202f\u03bcM, 350\u202f\u03bcl) were titrated with each peptide (1.5\u202fmM, 80\u202f\u03bcl), separately. The titration experiment was monitored using a MicroCal iTC200 system (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, USA) at 25 \u00b0C. Each ITC titration comprised 18 successive injections. Each peptide was titrated into different proteins and tested by ITC. The resultant ITC curves were processed using Origin (v.8.0) software (OriginLab) in accordance with the \u2018\u2018One Set of Sites\u2019\u2019 fitting model.\n\n\nProtein pull-down experiment\nAll GST-tagged proteins (BPTF-PB, CBP-BP, TRIM24-PB, and TAF1-BB) were first incubated with Glutatahione Sepharose 4B beads. After washing the beads five times (wash buffer, 50\u202fmM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150\u202fmM NaCl, 0.05% NP40), 1\u202fmg HEK293T nuclear extract was added to the beads which were previously bound to the tandem domain proteins and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The nuclear proteins enriched by the tandem-domain-protein probes (BPTF-PB, CBP-BP, TRIM24-PB, and TAF1-BB) served as sample groups. The beads incubated only with 1\u202fmg nuclear extracts served as the negative control group. After incubation, all the beads were washed with wash buffer I two times (wash buffer I, 50\u202fmM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350\u202fmM NaCl, 0.5% NP40) and with wash buffer II three times (wash buffer II, 50\u202fmM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350\u202fmM NaCl, 0.05% NP40) to remove false positive binding peptides. Finally, 5\u202f\u00d7\u202floading buffer was added to the beads, and the mixture was boiled at 95\u2103 for 5\u202fmin. Then, the enriched proteins were separated by a 10\u201312% gradient PAGE gel. The gel was dealt with silver staining and subjected to LC-MS\/MS analysis.\n\n\nLC-MS\/MS analysis\nAll proteins were first subject to in-gel trypsin digestion. Then, each sample of peptides was reconstituted in 7\u202f\u00b5l HPLC buffer A (0.1% (v\/v) formic acid in water), and 5\u202f\u00b5l was injected into a Nano-LC system (EASY-nLC 1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). We used C18 columns (50-\u03bcm inner diameter\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202fcm, 2\u202f\u03bcm C18) to separate each sample via an 85-minute HPLC-gradient (linear gradient from 2 to 35% HPLC buffer B and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile for 75\u202fmin and then to 90% buffer B in 10\u202fmin). The HPLC elution was electro-sprayed to an Orbit rap Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The source was operated at 1.8\u202fkV. We carried out mass spectrometric analysis in a data-dependent mode with an automatic switch between a full MS scan and an MS\/MS scan in the orbit rap. The automatic gain control (AGC) target was 3e6, and the scan range was from 400 to 1350 with a resolution of 70,000 in the full MS survey scan. We selected the 10 most intense peaks with a charge state of 2 and above for fragmentation by higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy of 27%. The MS2 spectra were acquired with 17,500 resolutions. Finally, we searched the MS\/MS data results against the UniProt database using MaxQuant software (v1.5.2.8) with a less than 1% overall false discovery rate (FDR) for peptides. The mass tolerance of LC-MS\/MS is 0.05\u202fDa. The peptide sequences were searched using trypsin specificity with a maximum of two missed cleavages. We performed three replicate experiments to evaluate experimental reproducibility. The mass spectrometry proteomics data were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [35] partner repository with dataset identifier PXD014909.\n\n\nLabel-free analysis\nThe nuclear proteins enriched by the GST-tagged tandem domain probes (BPTF-PB, CBP-BP, TRIM24-PB, and TAF1-BB) served as the sample group, while nuclear proteins enriched only by the Glutatahione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, USA) served as the control group. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins of sample group and control group were digested in gel and identified by LC-MS\/MS. Every identified protein has an LFQ intensity after searching with MaxQuant software (v1.5.2.8). The ratio was obtained when the experimental LFQ intensity divided by the control LFQ intensity of each identified protein. A ratio greater than 2.0-fold (ratio\u202f>\u202f2.0) was defined as indicative of \u201cenriched\u201d proteins. Then, bioinformatics analysis of enriched proteins was further carried out with the DAVID and KEGG database.\n\n\nBioinformatics analysis\nCategorical annotation was performed using Gene Ontology (GO). Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to analyze the biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC) of the proteins. The distribution of the different proteins in the metabolic pathways was demonstrated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways.\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nThe structures of tandem-domain proteins and readout of combinatorial HPTMs by these proteins\nThe proteins BPTF [13,36], TAF1 [37], CBP [38], TRIM24 [39] and TRIM33 [40] all have tandem PHD fingers and Bromodomain, except TAF1, which contains tandem Bromodomain. The plant homeodomain (PHD) finger recognizes methylated lysine [13,36,41\u201343], while Bromodomain recognizes acetylated lysine, which is involved in the suppression or activation of transcription [19,44,45]. Located in tandem with other reader domains, these domains often perform dual recognition of HPTMs, suggesting a potential cross-talk among readers [46]. PHD fingers and Bromodomain are conservative in different proteins or species [47,48]. However, the interactions or orientation in the Bromodomain-PHD or PHD-Bromodomain tandem modules are different, as shown in Fig. 1\nA. This finding implies that the unique function of a single domain or the whole function of tandem domains may be distinguished. It has been reported that these tandem domain proteins can read combinatorial HPTMs peptides, namely, BPTF-PHD-Bromo (BPTF-PB) reads H3K4me3\/H4K16ac [15], CBP-Bromo-PHD (CBP-BP) reads H4K12acK16ac [48], TRIM24-PHD-Bromo (TRIM24-PB) reads H3K4me3K23ac [39], TRIM33-PHD-Bromo (TRIM33-PB) reads H3K9me3K18ac [40] and TAF1-Bromo-Bromo (TAF1-BB) reads H4K5ac\/K8ac [37]. Here, we present schematics of the binding models of the five proteins (Fig. 1B).\nTo explain the relationship of the \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d, we carried out the experiments in two parts (Fig. S1). First, to profile the complicated interactions between combinatorial HPTMs and reader proteins, we incubated the peptide library with tandem-domain proteins using a new integrated method that screened and quantified the interactions by MALDI-TOF MS and ITC. Then, we used the tandem domain proteins as probes to enrich the interactive nucleoproteins and identified these proteins by HPLC-MS\/MS analysis.\n\n\nThe MALDI-TOF MS screening of the peptides recognized by tandem-domain proteins\nTo reveal the transient and slight interactions between combinatorial HPTMs peptides and tandem-domain proteins, we used an integrated method that combines MS and ITC analysis. The peptide library and highly sensitive MS were used to measure the interaction between the HPTMs peptides and the tandem-domain proteins. Then, ITC was used to quantitatively verify the interactions.\nWe incubated the proteins with a peptide library (Table 1\n) that contains combinatorial modifications on different amino acid sites. The identification of tandem-domain proteins and combinatorial HPTMs peptides by MS is provided in the supplemental information (Fig. S2, Figs. S3 and S7). To exclude nonspecific binding peptides, we incubated peptides only with GST beads as the negative control for comparison with peptides incubated with BPTF-PB (Fig. S4). Then, the enriched interactive peptides were identified by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 2\n). The results showed that the peptides H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3R2meK4me3, H3K9bu, H3K9cr, H3K9hib, H3K4me3K9ac, H3K4me3K9bu, H3K4me3K9cr and H3K4me3K9hib could be enriched by the four tandem-domain proteins, but the intensities of these peptides were different. This finding is consistent with previous reports that the domain-domain interactions or orientation between PHD fingers and Bromodomain affected the binding properties of these peptides [20]. However, we did not detect any peptides readout by TAIM33-PB.\nThe HPTMs readout patterns of the tandem-domain proteins revealed different readout properties. For example, the distribution of H3T3ph is opposite to that of H3K4me3, which reveals a Tph-mediated binary switch mechanism in active genes [49]. The diverse outcomes of the histone combinatorial readout by tandem-domain-reader proteins indicates a complex regulation based on multiple histone modifications. Using the integrated approach in this research, we could understand the interaction between combinational HPTMs and reading proteins by combining the sensitive MS technique with ITC analysis.\n\n\nThe quantitative analysis of the binding ability of combinatorial HPTM peptides with tandem-domain proteins by ITC\nTo quantify the binding affinities, we carried out ITC assays between the peptides containing combinatorial modifications and tandem-domain proteins based on the MS screening results (Fig. 3\n). The tandem-domain proteins used in ITC were digested by thrombin proteases to remove the GST tag and the digestion was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S5). We found that only BPTF-PB could efficiently bind different combinatorial HPTM peptides. No apparent heat change was detected in the other three proteins during ITC. K\nD and other thermodynamic parameters are reported in the supplemental information (Table S4).\nBPTF-PB could interact with several combinatorial HPTM peptides in our peptide library: H3R2meK4me3 (K\nD 13\u202f\u03bcM), H3K4me3K9ac (K\nD 15.8\u202f\u03bcM), H3K4me3K9bu (K\nD 27.6\u202f\u03bcM), H3K4me3K9cr (K\nD 17.5\u202f\u03bcM) and H3K4me3K9hib (K\nD 14.1\u202f\u03bcM) (Fig. 3 M\u2212Q). The measured interactions between BPTF-PB and H3R2meK4me3, H3K4me3K9ac or H3K4me3K9cr are consist with the previously reported interaction [13,33]. The other peptides (H3K4me3K9bu and H3K4me3K9hib) were found to interact with BPTF-PB for the first time. As known, the BPTF-PB readout of combinatorial HPTM peptides mainly depended on the PHD finger readout of H3K4me3 [36], and the Bromodomain of BPTF-PB could read acetylated lysine, which exhibits a synergistic effect [36]. These acetylation modifications (butyrylation, crotonylation, or 2-hydroxybutyrylation) are similar to lysine acetylation but exhibit different hydrocarbon chain lengths and hydrophobicity or charges [33,34]. Thus, the modifications might have the potential to stretch into the binding pocket of Bromodomain and ultimately lead to different binding abilities of BPTF-PB. Thus, given the strong interaction between PHD and H3K4me3, the peptides with combined modifications (H3K4me3K9bu, H3K4me3K9cr and H3K4me3K9hib) also interacted with BPTF-PB. In contrast, the other three proteins CBP-BP, TRIM24-PB, and TAF1-BB did not exhibit binding ability when titrated with the peptides in ITC. We hypothesized that these proteins lack of the molecular basis of BPTF-PB for which the interaction mainly relied on the PHD finger readout of H3K4me3 [36]. The extended hydrocarbon chains of butyrylation, crotonylation and hydroxybutyrylation on lysine increased the hydrophobicity and the bulk of the modified lysine residues in histones compared with lysine acetylation [33]. Thus, the interaction between these proteins and peptides was weak and transient, and it was difficult to detect. In general, compared with ITC, MALDI-TOF MS is a more sensitive technology to detect weak and transient interactions, and this integrated approach enabled us to detect the signal of the interactions between the combinatorial HPTMs and reading domains, which could not be easily observed in vivo.\n\n\nThe qualitative and quantitative analysis of differential enriched-proteins of these tandem-domain proteins by label-free analysis\nTo explore the nuclear proteins enriched by the tandem-domain proteins, we identified and analyzed these nucleoproteins by HPLC-MS\/MS. Here, we used four different proteins, BPTF-PB, TAF1-BB, CBP-BP and TRIM24-PB, as probes that were incubated with HEK293T cell nuclear extracts.\nNucleoproteins enriched by tandem-domain-protein probes (BPTF-PB, CBP-BP, TRIM24-PB and TAF1-BB) served as the sample group, while nuclear proteins enriched only by the beads served as the control group (Fig. S6). The ratio was obtained when the experimental LFQ intensity divided by the control LFQ intensity of each identified protein. The proteins which ratio\u202f>\u202f2.0 were defined as enriched proteins and we found that almost all the differential proteins belonged to enriched proteins (Fig. 4\nA) [40]. All these differential nucleoproteins could be separately enriched by BPTF-PB, TAF1-BB, CBP-BP or TRIM24-PB (Tab S1 and Tab S2), and these differential proteins were further analyzed by bioinformatics (Fig. 4B). Among the enriched proteins, HELLS [50], PRKDC [51], PLK1 [52], and PSIP1 [53] have been reported to interact with BPTF, while TRIP12 [54], BPTF [55], and PARP1 [56] interact with CBP.\nTo annotate and assess the biological roles of these proteins, we used Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to analyze the biological process, molecular function and cellular components of the proteins (Fig. 4C and 4D). The distribution map of cluster analysis reveals that the molecular functions of these 78 enriched proteins were associated with various binding processes, such as ATP binding or RNA binding (Fig. 4D). GO biological process analysis results showed that these proteins were significantly enriched in many cellular gene expression and transcription processes (Fig. 4C). In particular, 14 of these 78 enriched proteins could bind with DNA, RNA, histone or chromatin, which directly participated in transcription-related epigenetics processes (Fig. 7). The distribution of different proteins in metabolic pathways was analyzed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Proteins and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. These enriched proteins were mainly involved in five different metabolic pathways, particularly cell cycle and spliceosome (Tab S3). Collectively, these data revealed a high-probability role of these enriched proteins in the regulation of cellular transcription.\n\n\nThe cluster analysis of these enriched proteins\nTo discover the regulation patterns revealed by the similarity of enriched proteins, we carried out cluster analysis. We used Perseus software (v1.5.6) to cluster these 78 enriched proteins and to identify the relationship among BPTF-PB, TAF1-BB, CBP-BP and TRIM24-PB. The result reveals that the intensities of these proteins was relatively similar, even they were enriched by different tandem-domain proteins (Fig. 5\n). In addition, all these nuclear proteins have functions related to multiple cellular processes, such as transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling [12]. In general, the cluster analysis of these enriched proteins is of great significance in establishing the molecular network.\n\n\nThe special binding proteins in the network of \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d\nTo further reveal the relationship of the \u201cbinding complexes\u201d and \u201cHPTMs\u201d, we tried to screen and identify the proteins associated with both of them using the EpiFactors database. From the EpiFactors database, four nucleoproteins (MBB1A, HELLS, PRKDC and TRRAP) were identified that directly participated in epigenetic transcriptional regulation. These four proteins were perfectly identified by HPLC\/MS-MS. The specific peptides of each protein are presented in Fig. 6\n.\nMyb-binding protein 1A (MBB1A) [57] interacts with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins to activate or inhibit transcription. MBB1A is one of the components of the histone phosphorylation-modifying complex and chromatin-remodeling complex that can phosphorylate H2AXY142. DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PRKDC) [58] is a serine\/threonine protein kinase. As a molecular sensor of DNA damage, PRKDC participates in double-strand breaks and repairs. PRKDC is a HPTM writer that can phosphorylate histones, especially H2AXS139 and H2AFXS139. Transformation\/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP) [59] is a histone acetylation writer cofactor and provides specific tags for transcriptional activation. Lymphoid-specific helicase (HELLS, also as LSH) [60\u201362] participates in the formation of heterochromatin and chromatin remodeling. HELLS could also maintain DNA methylation and modify histones. Thus, all of these four proteins that can interact with reader proteins can also modify the histones. Finally, direct links of the network \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d have been established by these four proteins.\n\n\nThe molecular network of \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d\nFinally, the two functions of reader proteins, which read combinatorial histone modifications and interact with nucleoproteins, were linked together to explain their relationship. As an important linker, the tandem-domain-reader proteins connect the HPTMs with binding complexes to form the network (Fig. 7\n). From the network, the tandem-domain-reader proteins could read different combinatorial HPTMs peptides and interact with nucleoproteins. The interactive nucleoproteins were separated into two parts based on function, namely, transcription and other functions.\nThese reader proteins often exist in protein complexes associated with chromatin [12,47]. In addition to HPTM-dependent histone bindings, reader proteins could also mediate other protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, ultimately contributing to the overall chromatin interaction [46,63]. Given the presence of multiple proteins in the complex, their multivalent interaction increases the affinity and specificity and leads to different biological outcomes [15,16]. The knowledge of this network is beneficial for interpreting the mechanism and for translating this molecular network language into downstream functions given their significant roles in gene activation.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the study, we established an integrated method to identify the molecular network of the \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d for understanding the molecular mechanism of HPTM. Our results showed that the method was beneficial for the comprehensive analysis of combinatorial HPTMs crosstalk. Focusing on the interaction between tandem-domain proteins and peptides containing combinatorial modifications, we found that all the tandem-domain proteins (BPTF-PB, CBP-BP, TRIM24-PB, TRIM33-PB, and TAF1-BB) have the potential to read dual-modification peptides, especially BPTF-PB, which could interact strongly with H3R2meK4me3, H3K4me3K9ac, H3K4me3K9bu, H3K4me3K9cr and H3K4me3K9hib. The results also indicated the effect of the new modifications (such as butyrylation, crotonylation, or 2-hydroxybutyrylation) on such interactions. Then, we analyzed the relationship between the tandem-domain proteins and nuclear proteins. Using GST pull-down and HPLC-MS\/MS identification, we identified 78 enriched proteins and screened out differential enrichment of the reading domains. Together, we identified the interaction network of \u201cHPTMs-reader proteins-binding complexes\u201d, which will be helpful to understand the crosstalk between combinatorial HPTMs, to interpret the binding mechanisms of tandem domain histone readers, and to dissect the regulatory mechanism of dual HPTMs and the downstream activities regulated by histone codes.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects\n\n","52":"\n\nIntroduction\nGlobal warming is one of the main challenges faced in this 21st century. The main cause is CO2 emissions from anthropogenic origin, which are mainly produced by the combustion of fossil fuels [1]. Despite increasing effort in developing environmentally friendly technologies based on renewable energy sources, fossil fuel power plants still account for a significant share of the overall energy mix. Thus, greenhouse gas emissions from this type of facilities are still at unacceptable levels [2]. The main alternative renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuel power plants are wind and solar. Nonetheless, these technologies share an important shortcoming in their inability to provide a constant energy supply due to the intrinsic intermittency of wind and sunlight. Concentrated solar power plants (CSP) offer the possibility of integrating grid energy production with large-scale thermal energy storage (TES) thereby achieving dispatchability [3,4]. TES systems in commercial CSP plants include steam accumulators and high specific heat molten salts [4\u20136]. However, storing the heat produced by direct solar radiation as chemical energy entail several advantages [7,8]. For instance, the long-term storage of the products without radiative heat losses becomes possible. At the same, the continuous energy consumption required to maintain the salts in molten state is avoided [9]. Finally, Current molten salts are limited to about 560\u202f\u00b0C to avoid degradation, thereby limiting the maximum attainable efficiency [10]. Achieving higher temperatures could boost the efficiency of the thermodynamic power cycle as the difference between charge and discharge temperature becomes larger [8,11]. Finally, exergy efficiency is enhanced due to the larger energy densities provided by reaction enthalpies as compared to sensible and latent heats [8,12,13]. Among several chemical looping alternatives, the calcium looping (CaL) process has attracted a great deal of interest as a very promising system for thermochemical energy storage (TCES) since it displays several advantages such as low cost, high reaction temperature, acceptable reversibility and high energy density [14\u201316].\nIn the last decades, the CaL process has been explored as an avenue to mitigate CO2 emissions in fossil fuel power plants and cement manufacture facilities since it constitutes an effective technology for CO2 capture and storage (CCS). The CaL process is based on the reversible calcination of CaCO3 into CaO [17]:\n\n(1)\nCaCO3(s)\u202f\u21cc\u202fCaO(s)\u202f+\u202fCO2(g) \u0394Hr\n0\u202f=\u202f178\u202fkJ\u00b7mol\u22121\n\n\n\n\nThis reaction has been widely studied since it is a fundamental step in cement production. Thus, it is relatively feasible to establish the optimum conditions for direct and reverse reaction depending on the application. CaCO3 is inexpensive and abundant in the form of different minerals (limestone, marble, dolomite, etc) [18,19]. It exhibits a high reaction enthalpy that allows for a high theoretical energy density, ranging from 1 to 4 GJ\/m3 depending on the author and estimation method [12,13,20]. In the last years, several schemes regarding the integration of the CaL process in CSP plants (CaL-CSP) [14,21\u201323]. These contemplate the calcination of CaCO3 using direct solar radiation as heat source. Solar radiation can impinge directly on the storage material or it can be used to heat up the external walls of a solar particle receiver [14,24]. Stored energy is recovered through the reverse exothermic solid-gas reaction between CaO and CO2 at higher temperatures in the carbonator. Excess CO2 out of the carbonator is then circulated to power a CO2 turbine and produce electricity on demand. The high temperature of the working gas would ensure higher efficiency as compared with that of TES plants [16].\nThe CaL process exhibits two significant drawbacks that penalize its large-scale implementation, the incomplete conversion of CaO and its progressive deactivation along the successive carbonation\/calcination cycles [14,25]. The decay in CaO conversion is generally attributed to the extensive sintering and loss of surface area that occur at the high temperature and high CO2 partial pressure required [26\u201328]. Moreover, it has been observed that, when calcination is carried out in inert gas, a blocking CaCO3 layer rapidly forms on the CaO particles surface during the subsequent carbonation. This pore-plugging layer severely hinders further diffusion of CO2 molecules and prevents achieving complete conversion [29\u201331]. Therefore, the optimum conditions for CSP storage would be those that maximize the discharge temperature in order to improve the efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle while avoiding excessive sorbent deactivation. Recent studies have shown that can be achieved by carrying out the calcination at the lowest possible temperature in inert gas, and the carbonation at the maximum attainable temperature in CO2, normally about 950\u202f\u00b0C [32,33]. However, pressurized carbonation (at ~3 bars) would allow to further extend the maximum carbonation temperature [16,34].\nBeing one of the relevant challenges to overcome towards making the CaL-CSP technology attractive at industrial level, a number of strategies have been devised to reduce CaO deactivation. Thus, it is well known that crystallinity [35], particle size [18,36], morphology [37,38] and the inclusion of additives [19,39] have a strong influence on Ca-based multicycle performance. Regarding the impact of particle size, it has been observed that large or highly crystalline particles exhibit substantially slower decarbonation kinetics, thereby requiring higher temperatures for the complete regeneration of CaO in short residence times [40]. Additionally, carbonation in large particles is hindered by pore diffusion and pore-plugging [30,41,42]. On the other hand, small particles exhibits faster calcination at lower temperatures, what eventually results in improved long term recyclability [18]. Moreover, the use of small particles would facilitate the integration with solar energy and decrease the cost in materials for constructing the solar receiver [43]. However, small particles are difficult to handle in industrial processes based on fluidised bed reactors. Trajectories and residence times of particles in cyclones strongly depend on their size while collection efficiency decays markedly for particles with sizes below 10\u202f\u00b5m [44,45]. Thus, the usual particle size lower limit to ensure an acceptable efficiency of cyclones is about 50\u202f\u00b5m. Overall, the optimum particle size in pilot plants based on fluidised bed reactors has been found to lie within the 100\u2013300\u202f\u00b5m range [46,47].\nDespite its importance, the influence of particle size in CaL-CSP has yet to be explored in sufficient detail since most published works use material with very wide particle size distributions. In this study, multicycle CaL-CSP experiments have been carried out using limestone sample sets with well-defined particle sizes, ranging from small 4-\u03bcm particles to large 900-\u03bcm particles. At the same time, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) has been used to observe the morphological changes undergone by the material during consecutive carbonation and calcination cycles, in order to assess the mechanism responsible of the loss of activity. The results herein shed light on the relationship between particle size, extent of conversion after each cycle and deactivation after repeated carbonation and calcination cycles. Two different CaL-CSP operation schemes have been considered. First, the calcination stage is carried out in helium (CSP-He) as originally conceived in [32]. This procedure takes advantage of the high thermal conductivity of helium and the high diffusivity of CO2 in this gas to favour the calcination process so that full decarbonation is achieved in short residence times at temperatures as low as 700\u2013750\u202f\u00b0C. However, employment of helium at industrial scale entails technical issues such as high cost, gas losses and the necessity of gas separation from CO2 after calcination. Thus, the tests have also been carried out using an alternative operation scheme in CO2 closed cycle. This second integration scheme would be less complicated to implement technically but would entail raising the calcination temperature up to 950\u202f\u00b0C.\n\n\nExperimental\n\nMaterials\nThe samples used in this work were limestone from standard Eskal series supplied by KSL Staubtechnik GmbH (Germany). The Eskal series are widely used in powder technology studies as standards for calibration of equipment and testing. Particle size distributions were determined by laser diffraction as reported in [48]. Five different samples with a well-defined average particle size were studied (2, 4, 15, 30 and 80\u202f\u00b5m). An additional sample with larger particle size, ranging from 700 to 1000\u202f\u00b5m, was also tested. Samples will be referred hereafter as KO2, KO4, KO15, KO30, KO80 and KO900. PSD data are listed in Table 1\n while frequency distributions of particle sizes for all samples are plotted in Fig. 1\n.\n\n\nMethods\nMulticycle calcination\/carbonation tests were carried out in a TA instrument Q5000IR TG analyzer equipped with a IR furnace composed of a SiC reaction chamber heated by IR lamps that allows high cooling and heating rates up to 300\u202f\u00b0C\u00b7min\u22121. Such rates are necessary to emulate realistic CaL conditions in which the material is rapidly circulated between carbonator and calciner at different temperatures. All tests were run using small sample masses (\u224810\u202fmg) in order to avoid interfering mass and heat transfer phenomena as well as to facilitate exchanges with the surrounding atmosphere. The reaction chamber has a volume of just 20\u202fcm3. According to process simulations, the maximum efficiency in CaL-CSP plants, not considering pressurized conditions, is achieved when the carbonation reaction takes place in a high CO2 concentration environment at about 850\u202f\u00b0C [16]. Considering this, the samples were tested according to the energy storage conditions described below:\n\nCSP-He\nCSP-He experiments begin with a calcination step (from room temperature to 750\u202f\u00b0C at 300\u202f\u00b0C\u00b7min\u22121) under He atmosphere followed by a 5-min isothermal stage. After this first calcination, carbonation is initiated in pure CO2 atmosphere by increasing the temperature at a rate of 300\u202f\u00b0C\u00b7min\u22121 up to 850\u202f\u00b0C, and keeping this temperature for 5\u202fmin. Then, a new calcination stage is triggered by reducing the temperature at 300\u202f\u00b0C\u00b7min\u22121 down to 750\u202f\u00b0C under He, followed by 5-min isotherm. An intermediate step is introduced after calcination by decreasing the temperature down to 300\u202f\u00b0C under He for 2\u202fmin. This stage is intended to simulate the extraction of sensible heat from reaction products after calcination. After this cooling step a new cycle is started, for a total of 20 carbonation\/calcination cycles.\n\n\nCSP-CO2\n\nCSP-CO2 experiments begin with a precalcination stage (from room temperature to 950\u202f\u00b0C at 300\u202f\u00b0C\u00b7min\u22121, held for 5\u202fmin) in high CO2 concentration (95% CO2\/5% air vol\/vol). Precalcination is followed by a carbonation stage without changing the atmosphere by quickly decreasing the temperature down to 850\u202f\u00b0C at 300\u202f\u00b0C\u00b7min\u22121 and maintaining this temperature for 5\u202fmin. A total of 20 carbonation\/calcination cycles were run in these tests.\nSEM micrographs of gold-sputtered samples (40\u202fmA, 30\u202fs) were taken employing a Hitachi S4800 FEG microscope at 5\u202fkV.\nNitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms were measured using an ASAP2420 (Micromeritics) instrument. Samples degassing was carried out at 300\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh. Total surface areas (SBET) were determined using the BET equation. In order to prepare the amount of sample needed for BET measurements, a tubular furnace was employed. Samples were prepared in small batches (300\u202fmg of CaCO3 at a time) to minimize mass and heat transfer phenomena during the calcination and carbonation reactions. The experimental schemes were similar to that described in B.1 and B.2 but calcination times had to be extended to 30\u202fmin to ensure complete decarbonation.\n\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nMulticycle conversion\n\nFig. 2\n shows, as an example, the complete thermograms recorded in the multicycle tests in both CSP-He and CSP-CO2 conditions for the KO30 sample. The main implication of the latter conditions is that calcination temperature needs to be raised up to 950\u202f\u00b0C in order to achieve complete decarbonation within the scheduled 5-min step, as compared to just 750\u202f\u00b0C required when helium is used as carrier gas. Fig. 3\n includes a detail of the 1st, 10th and 20th cycles, highlighting the differences in the fast kinetic-driven and diffusion driven carbonation phases depending on particle size and operation scheme. It has been amply reported that the carbonation in CaL processes proceeds through two well differentiated stages [42]; first a rapid reaction controlled phase that depends on CaO available surface which is abruptly followed by a much slower diffusion controlled phase that triggers once a barrier layer composed of CaCO3 product forms, hindering further diffusion of CO2 molecules [49]. The diffusion controlled stage becomes rate-limiting step once the CaCO3 product layer reaches the critical value that depends on reaction conditions [31].\n\nFig. 3 illustrates the influence of particle size, cycle number and operation scheme on the relative importance of fast reaction-controlled and slow diffusion-controlled carbonation stages. It can be inferred from the plots in Fig. 3a and b that in CSP-He the carbonation reaction is mainly determined by the fast reaction regime, with negligible CO2 uptake during the subsequent diffusion-controlled stage. This behaviour serves to highlight the pore-plugging phenomenon, since the rapid formation of a blocking CaCO3 layer limits further CO2 diffusion to the porous interior of the particle. Therefore, in CSP-He conditions, the conversion at each cycle depends mostly on the extension of the carbonation achieved during the fast stage since the relative contribution of diffusion-controlled carbonation is very small. In contrast, the relative contribution of each carbonation phase differs in CSP-CO2. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, in CSP-CO2 the weight of diffusion-controlled carbonation is much more relevant. The extension of the reaction-controlled stage during the first recarbonation is roughly independent of the particle size save for the largest KO900 particles, which displays an unusual behaviour that might be related to its substantially slower decarbonation kinetics. However, the diffusion-controlled regime is promoted in smaller particles. Finally, Fig. 3d shows a marked decrease of the reaction-controlled carbonation with the cycle number. After 10 cycles, the carbonation is mainly diffusive, what implies that the CaO is heavily sintered (Fig. 3d). Another important issue, illustrated in Fig. 4\n, is decarbonation kinetics. The measured reaction rate is much faster when calcining at CSP-CO2 conditions due to the higher employed temperatures.\nThe CaO conversion (X) is used to quantitatively compare the performance of different materials and reaction conditions. This parameter provides a measure of the extension of the reaction at any given cycle. It is defined as the ratio of the mass of CaO converted in the carbonation stage of each cycle to the total CaO mass before carbonation [50]. In order to extrapolate at long term and determine the residual conversion after a large number of cycles, the conversion plots can be fitted by the following semi-empirical equation [26,50]:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nX\nN\n\n=\nX\nr\n+\n\n\n\n\nX\n1\n\n\nK\n\n\nN\n-\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n1\n-\n\n\nXr\n\n\nX\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere Xr is the residual conversion, which converges asymptotically after a large number of cycles), K is the so-called deactivation constant, X\n1 is the conversion at the first cycle and X\n20 the conversion at the 20th cycle. Best fitting parameters are included in Table 2\n. In summary, the data show that conversion achieved in CSP-He is in all cases higher than the conversion achieved in CSP-CO2. However, the difference in residual conversion, the really relevant parameter for industrial purposes, is only significant for KO2 and KO4; the two smaller particle sizes tested.\n\nFig. 5\n includes the comparison of the CaO conversion as a function of the cycle number obtained for each particle size and for both CSP-He and CSP-CO2 reaction conditions. The largest particle size tested (KO900) in CSP-He conditions displays a low conversion during the first carbonation. That occurs because the first calcination is incomplete since decarbonation kinetics are very slow for such large particle sizes [30]. As expected, the decay of CaO conversion is more pronounced for larger particles since they are more liable to deactivation by pore-plugging [30]. Also, cycling stability is noticeably impaired in CSP-CO2 due to the significantly harsher calcination conditions (950\u202f\u00b0C in pure CO2) thereby favouring the loss of reactive surface due to sintering [27]. However, the detrimental effect of using large particles is much more important in CSP-He, with a substantial drop in residual conversion from 0.55 to 0.15 as the average particle size (d50) increases from 2 to 900\u202f\u03bcm respectively. On the other hand, the handicap of using large particles is less significant in CSP-CO2 conditions. In such case, the residual CaO conversion drops from 0.17 to just 0.07 for the same average size increase (from 2 and 900\u202f\u03bcm). It is nonetheless surprising the limited influence of particle size on conversion observed in CSP-He over a minimum threshold value. Thus, multicycle conversion performance only improves substantially for average sizes below 15\u202f\u03bcm. This entails significant implications towards any prospective application at large scale. Since fine particles below 50\u202f\u03bcm are cohesive and cannot be fluidised in practical applications and long term conversion of large particles is not significantly worse in CSP-CO2 conditions, our work suggests the technically simpler closed CO2 system might eventually be more advantageous, at least from the point of view of materials performance.\n\n\nInfluence of particle size and reaction conditions on sample morphology\nIn order to gain a better understanding of the influence of particle size on multicycle performance, the morphological changes undergone during carbonation and calcination stages have been studied by SEM. For comparative purposes, the samples KO2 and KO80 are chosen as representative of very small and large particles respectively. Fig. 6\n includes the micrographs of as received limestone. The relatively large particles in KO80 sample appear as non-aggregated individual particles comprising a narrow distribution range. On the other hand, KO2 particles form larger aggregates due to cohesive forces, which for this size are much stronger than the particle weight [51]. In both cases, particles are constituted by well-defined crystals.\nSEM micrographs in Fig. 7\n shows comparative sequences of the morphological changes undergone by KO2 and KO80 particles during the CaL cycles carried out in CSP-He conditions. The micrographs correspond to the CaO arising after the first calcination stage, the CaCO3 formed in the subsequent recarbonation stage; the CaCO3 formed after 20 cycles and finally the CaO after calcination in the 20th cycle.\n\nCSP-He\nKO2 sample, composed of small particles averaging 2\u202f\u03bcm, forms sizable aggregates through the entire multicycle experiment. After just one calcination and carbonation stage (Fig. 7a and b respectively) the individual particles can still be distinguished whereas repeating cycles lead to the merging of neighbouring particles into large porous structures (Fig. 7c and d). This morphology, composed of small aggregates, grants the material a remarkable cycling stability. Arguably, this structure proves very resistant to deactivation by pore-plugging, thereby ensuring a high surface area of CaO available for carbonation remains despite repeated cycling (Fig. 7d). In contrast, while KO80 particles leave a relatively porous structure after the initial carbonation (Fig. 7e), the subsequent carbonation stage leads to the rapid formation of a CaCO3 blocking layer preventing the diffusion of CO2 molecules to the interior of the particle. Subsequent calcination and carbonation stages eventually lead to the progressive sintering of the surface layer, which is ultimately the only part of the particle that undergoes repeated transformations. Fig. 7g and h show the porous core underneath the sintered surface created by the pore-plugging effect after 20 calcination and carbonation cycles. The grain growth and sintering occur mainly during the carbonation stage as it is promoted by CO2. Actually, both KO2 and KO80 samples (Fig. 7b and f) evidence considerable grain growth even after the first recarbonation, with the formation of a mosaic structure, comprised of about 1 \u00b5m grains covering the entire particle surface. Therefore, the limited grain size observed underneath the external sintered layer in Fig. 7g and h proves the inner core has remained inactive during the cycles. In the inset of Fig. 7h, a fracture is shown to emphasize the marked differences between the surface CaCO3 shell and the inner unreacted CaO core. It should be noted that the inset in Fig. 7h was taken using identical magnification as the main image to better highlight the disparity in grain sizes. Finally, it is interesting how the conversion of CaCO3 into CaO exhibits a shape-memory feature; the shades of the previous CaCO3 grains are apparent in subsequent CaO (Fig. 7g). This shape-memory feature preserves the blocking layer along the carbonation and calcinations cycles and facilitates further sintering, leading to the progressive decay in CaO conversion.\nThe relationship between these morphological transformations and the multicycle behavior described is Fig. 5a is clear. The relevance of the pore-plugging effect depends on particle size; the larger the size, the higher the volume of material that remains inactive underneath the plugging layer. Hence the limited CaO conversion exhibited by the larger particle sizes in the multicycle tests. For smaller particles, a greater fraction of the material contributes to conversion each carbonation stage. Furthermore, the CaO arising from the calcination of the mosaic-like sintered structure shows a significant loss of surface porosity (Fig. 7g) with respect the starting material (Fig. 7a) leading to a decay in CaO conversion along ensuing cycles. Table 3\n includes the BET surface area values measured for KO2 and KO80 samples after one calcination and after 5 carbonation and calcination cycles. As expected, there is a reduction in surface area because of sintering after a few cycles. Surface available for carbonation decreases about 30% in the case of the small KO2 particles whereas the reduction reaches 50% for the larger KO80 particles. That difference can be attributed to the formation of the sintered surface layer. It is also interesting that the surface area for all 4 samples studied is quite similar after the first calcination.\n\n\nCSP-CO2\n\nAs it will be discussed hereafter, sample behaviour is remarkably different when cycled in CSP-CO2 conditions, due to the harsher calcination conditions; pure CO2 and a high temperature of 950\u202f\u00b0C. The overall effect on the multicycle conversion is a worsening of cycling performance with respect to CSP-He conditions, especially in the case of smaller particles. The sequence shown in Fig. 8\na\u2013d illustrate how small KO2 particles cycled in CSP-CO2 conditions endure progressive aggregation, eventually leading to the formation of a macroporous structure constituted of merged neighbouring grains. Also, while in CaCO3 form, well developed grains in mosaic structures are clearly distinguished. However, the morphology of subsequent CaO exhibits striking features that contrast with what previously observed in CSP-He. Instead of preserving the mosaic structure attained by CaCO3 grains in the preceding carbonation stage, CaO arising in CSP-CO2 conditions constitutes a macroporous globular structure containing large channels. Moreover, no differences in morphology were observed between the surface and the interior of the particles. Thus, it seems that pore-plugging phenomenon is not that relevant in this CSP-CO2 operation scheme as the formation of macroporous channels largely prevents the particles to be completely covered by the clogging carbonate layer. This arrangement is a consequence of the high temperatures attained, well over CaCO3 Tamman temperature (about 500\u202f\u00b0C), that strongly promote mass transfer by solid state diffusion [52]. That, coupled with the grain-growth promoting effect of CO2 lead to extensive sintering all over the entire particle volume. In the case of samples with small average size, neighbouring particles merge as seen in Fig. 8c and 8d. After 20 carbonation and calcination cycles, the loss of surface area is substantial as observed in the insets of Fig. 8c and g. The surface of the CaO appears smooth (Fig. 8d and h) in contrast with the cracked surface evidenced in samples cycled in CSP-He (Fig. 7d and h). The progressive loss of micro and mesoporosity in CaO formed under CSP-CO2 after repeated cycling might explain the reduction in relative weight of the fast reaction-controlled carbonation in relation to the diffusion-controlled carbonation. Besides, as illustrated in Fig. 4, decarbonation rate is at least five times faster at 950\u202f\u00b0C in CO2 than at 750\u202f\u00b0C in helium. Sudden release of occluded gases in short times within a high mobility matrix might induce the formation of a globular-like or foamy structure, as it has been observed in a somewhat different systems, such as the pyrolysis of rice husk to form SiO2\n[53]. Contrary to what occurs in the case of CSP-He, under CSP-CO2 operation conditions there is little advantage in using small-sized particles since the extensive sintering and particle merging rapidly destroy the relatively open structure displayed in CSP-He (Fig. 7b and d). Table 3 also includes the BET surface area values measured for KO2 and KO80 samples after one calcination and after 5 carbonation and calcination cycles in these experimental conditions. As it occurred in the previous CSP-He conditions, the decline in surface area after 5 consecutive carbonation and calcination reactions is more marked in larger particles, amounting to 75% and 40% for KO80 and KO2 samples respectively.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this work, the influence of particle size on limestone multicycle chemical looping conversion has been studied under operation conditions relevant for thermochemical energy storage applications. Experimental multicycle tests have been carried out using calcination in helium at relatively low temperatures and calcination at high temperatures in 100% CO2. Limestone particles of well-defined and narrow particle size distributions have been employed in the analysis. When calcination is carried out in helium at low temperature, the CaO conversion is substantially better for small particles as they are more resilient to pore-plugging, the main deactivation mechanism in CSP-He. Nevertheless, the enhancement is only substantial for particles below 15\u202f\u03bcm, which might be difficult to employ in industrial applications involving fluidised bed reactors. Over that size, the formation of a blocking CaCO3 layer on the particles surface prevents further diffusion of CO2 to the inner particle core. Thus, a substantial volume of material remains inactive during the carbonation stage thereby limiting CaO conversion. On the other hand, when calcination is carried out in CO2 at high temperatures, the deactivation of the material can be attributed to severe sintering all over the entire particle volume and the loss of surface porosity. Consequently, the improvement in conversion achieved by using particles with small average size is very limited. For particle sizes over 15\u202f\u03bcm, the multicycle performance is relatively similar regardless the operation conditions. Thus, the CSP-CO2 scheme of closed loop might be more advantageous for techno-economic reasons due to the high cost of helium and the simplicity of design. It has also been found that the carbonation process in CSP-He is mostly driven by fast kinetically controlled reaction while in CSP-CO2 conditions solid-state diffusion has a relevant contribution. The residual CaO conversion attained in our experiments for particle-size usable at industrial level is still below 0.4, the critical value to make the technology competitive with respect to molten salts. Nevertheless, the sequence of morphological changes here presented brings valuable insight into the deactivation mechanism and can provide researchers a guide regarding the type of macroporous structures to be sought in order to minimise the sorbent deactivation.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","53":"\n\nIntroduction\nEnvironmental pollution is deemed one of most serious issues that should be taken care of due to its catastrophic influences on human health and environment [1]. Therefore, many countries have paid considerable attention to avert or treat environmental pollution [2,3]. Pollutants of water and waste water industries such as heavy metals have been treated using different physical and chemical processes. Compared to all the different wastewater industries, water containing radioactive pollutants (uranium and thorium) is the most dangerous wastewater. Thus, researchers are still investigating different methods to remove radioactive elements from liquid wastes for safe disposal [4\u20136]. Uranium (U) is a very significant toxic and radioactive element that is utilized in many nuclear applications. However, it has negative effects on the environment and needs to be removed from radioactive waste water[7]. Uranium from nuclear industrial processes seeps into the environment, pollutes water or soil and enters plants and from comes in contact with human bodies, causing severe damage to the kidneys or liver that lead to death [8]. Various processes, such as precipitation, evaporation, ion exchange, liquid-liquid extraction, membrane separation [9\u201313], have been used to treat the radioactive liquid wastes. However, these methods are not successful or cost-effective, especially when dealing with the great volumes of liquid waste includes low concentrations of radioactive pollutants [14]. For that reason, many researchers considered adsorption to be one of the most efficient processes to treat this limits of pollutants. Adsorption process has been considered to be an advantageous technique (simple construction and operation) and it uses a variety of adsorbent materials such as modified rice stem [15], codoped graphene [16], nanogoethite powder [17], iron\/magnetite carbon composites [18] and sporangiospores of mucor circinelloides [19], to adsorb pollutants from the liquid phase. Flax fibers are obtained from agriculture as a by-product. It is composed of fibers, cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin containing functional groups in their chemical composition such as carboxyl, hydroxyl group which have a major role in facilitating adsorption processes. The current work, deals with the treatment of high concentrations of uranium ions discharged from nuclear processes (mining, nuclear fuel manufacture and application), which must be treated to the lowest concentration before being transferred to the relevant processing units such as the Hot Labs Center, Atomic Energy Authority, Cairo. In this research, the focus was on the use of natural degradation materials such as flax fibers to remove and recover the U element from the liquid wastes. The factors affecting the batch sorption(pH, sorbent dose, initial feed concentration, contact time, and temperature) were optimized and the results were evaluated using isotherm and kinetics models.\n\n\nMaterials & methods\n\nMaterials\nFlax fiber was obtained from flax industry, Tanta, Egypt. Flax fiber was prepared as follows: they were cut into <3\u20135\u202fmm pieces and washed by hot water many times to remove wax and foreign matters. Washing was continued until all contaminants were removed and clear water was obtained. After that, flax fibers were dried at 378\u202fK to dry the fibers. Liquid samples of experiments were prepared from uranyl acetate (UO2(OCOCH3)2\u00b76H2O). Feed and finial uranium concentrations (mg\/l) were determined spectrophotometrically (Shimadzu UV\u2013VIS-1601 spectrophotometer) using arsenazo (III) [20]. All chemicals and reagents used in this research were analytical grades.\n\n\nMethods\nTo study the adsorption performance of the prepared flax fibers, sorption of U (VI) ions was investigated in a batch system. A known weight of adsorbent was agitated at 250\u202frpm with 60\u202fmL uranium sample in a thermostatic shaker water bath of type (Julabo, Model SW \u221220\u202f\u00b0C, Germany) at different conditions (Table 2). 0.1\u202fM HNO3 or 0.1\u202fM NH4OH solutions were utilized to adjust pH (Metrohm E-632, Heisau, Switzerland). The fiber was separated by filter paper and the sample was spectrophotometrically analyzed. Maximum uptake capacity qe (mg\/g) and adsorption percent [R (%)] were determined by following equations.\n\n(1)\n\n\nR\n\n\n%\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nfeed\u00a0concentration - final\u00a0concentration\n\n\/feed\u00a0concentration\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nq\n\n\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nfeed\u00a0concentration\u00a0-final\u00a0concentration\n\nx\n\n\nVolume\u00a0of\u00a0sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass\u00a0of\u00a0flax\u00a0fiber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorption kinetics\nThree kinetic models were used to explain and estimate the uptake of uranium ions on flax fiber by linear and nonlinear techniques [21]. Non-linear technique is a better system to acquire the parameters of kinetic models.\n\nPseudo-first-order model\nThis model [22], is explained by the following equations:\n\n(3)\n\n\nNon-linear\n:\n\n\nq\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\nq\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n(\n1\n-\n\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n1\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nLinear\n:\n\nL\no\ng\n\n(\n\nq\ne\n\n-\n\nq\nt\n\n)\n\n=\nL\no\ng\n\n(\n\nq\ne\n\n)\n\n-\n\n(\n1\n-\n\nK\n1\n\n\/\n2.303\n)\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudo-second-order model\nThe model is explained by equations [23]:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nNon - linear\n\n:\n\nq\nt\n\n=\n\nK\n2\n\n\nq\ne\n2\n\nt\n\/\n\n(\n1\n+\n\nK\n2\n\n\nq\ne\n\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\nLinear:\nt\n\/\n\nq\nt\n\n=\n\n(\n1\n\/\n\nK\n2\n\n\nq\ne\n2\n\n)\n\n+\n\n(\n1\n\/\n\nq\ne\n\n)\n\nt\n\n\n\nwhere, qe and qt are the sorption capacity at final and any time t (mg\/g) and K1 (L\/min) and K2 (g\/mg.min) are the constants of the pseudo-first and second order models, respectively.\n\n\nThe Elovich kinetic model\nThe Elovich model is used to illustrate the chemisorption process assuming that the sorbent surfaces are vigorously heterogeneous, but the equation does not suggest any specific mechanism for sorbate\u2013sorbent and is explained by equation [24]:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\nNon - linear\n\n:\n\n\nd\n\nq\nt\n\n\/\nd\nt\n=\n\u03b1\n\nexp\n\n(\n-\n\u03b2\nd\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parameters of \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the Elovich constants which refer to the sorption rate (mg\/g. min), and the capacity of flax fiber (g\/mg), respectively.

Lignin acts as a bonding material. The composition (cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin and ash) of Fax fibers were analyzed using the process developed by Aravantinos-Zafiris et al. (1994) [25]. The chemical compositions of flax fiber are shown in Table 1\n.\n\n\nBET analysis\n\nFig. 2\n shows N2 sorption\u2013desorption isotherms (NOVA 2200E BET Surface Area Analyzer, Quantachrome Instruments) of flax fiber, which is described as IV- style with a hysteresis loop, which indicates a mesoporous nature of flax fiber. The hysteresis loop have a quick adsorption and desorption nature, representing a narrow mesopore size distribution. Flax fiber possesses a large surface area of 51.54\u202fm2\/g and a pore volume of 0.41\u202fcm3\/g. The active sites of flax fiber were provided by a high surface area. The active adsorptive sites result from the mesoporous nature of flax fiber leading to its the high adsorption capacity of uranium ions onto the fiber.\n\n\nFourier transformed infrared spectroscopy analysis (FTIR)\nThe FTIR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) of the flax fiber (Fig. 2) describes the properties of material components. The band at 3483\u202fcm\u22121 refers to OH group and CH bonds in the alkyl groups at 2910\u202fcm\u22121. The band at 1735\u202fcm\u22121 and 1642\u202fcm\u22121 explains that there is a CO group of hemicellulose and ketenes, respectively [15]. The bands at 1465 and 1433\u202fcm\u22121 represent symmetric CH, CH2 vibrations and CH group at 1387\u202fcm\u22121 of methyl group. The band near 1165\u20131130\u202fcm\u22121, refer to asymmetric COC. The bands at 1032\u202fcm\u22121 refer to the ether group of CO ether [27]. After the process of adsorption, changes were made in OH group, CH bonds and CO group to 3490, 2923 and 1653\u202fcm\u22121, respectively. These shifts indicate that there is a correlation between the uranium ions and the functional groups that make up the flax fibers by the ion exchange of H+ on the surface of fibers with UO2\n2+ which changes the vibration strength and peak wavenumber[15]. The shifts in wavelength and the alteration in absorption intensity of OH group, CH bonds and CO groups can be correlated to the mechanism of adsorption. The presence of OH stretching vibration may be attributed to the components of cellulose and lignin that may required in UO2\n2+ binding during ion exchange and\/or complexation mechanisms [28].\n\n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis\n\nFig. 3\n (a and b), shows the XRD pattern of flax fiber before and after adsorption was performed by X-ray diffractmeter (Philips instrument PW 1730). In the raw flax fiber four patterns of diffraction are presented at 2\u03b8\u202f=\u202f14.82\u00b0, 16.56\u00b0, 22.76\u00b0, and 33.99\u00b0, which refer to the planes of (\u202f\u22121\u202f1\u202f0), (1\u202f1\u202f0), (2\u202f0\u202f0), and (0\u202f0\u202f4), respectively, indicating the crystalline structure of cellulose after adsorption[29]. Similar diffraction peaks were observed, and additionally new peaks at 2\u03b8\u202f=\u202f33.22\u00b0, and 74.55\u00b0 referred to planes of (1\u202f1\u202f1) and (3\u202f1\u202f1), respectively. The appearance of new peaks and decreasing of the crystal structure after the uranium uptake may owe to the uptake of U(VI) by flax fibers, which causes part of the particle construction to modify from crystal to amorphous[11].\n\n\nThermal analysis\nThermal analysis was performed by DTA-50 Differential Thermal Analyzer, Japan. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows a degradation percent of 3.3% within 304\u2013501\u202fK, of dehydration reactions of water content [30]. The degradation percent of flax fiber begin at 502\u202fK and increase with increasing the temperature to 80% between 502\u202fK and 683\u202fK (Fig. 3C). The degradation percent within 684\u2013798\u202fK was 6.3%, of char degradation [31]. Differential thermal gravimetry analysis (DTG) shows two peaks at 565 and 648\u202fK which corresponding to light and heavy materials, respectively. DTG curve indicates that the maximum degradation happened at the temperature 648\u202fK with the rate of 0.68\u202fmg\/min.\nThermal analysis indicates that there are two steps are involved in the degradation of flax fiber. The first step is the hemicellulose degradation [31], between 565\u202fK and 598\u202fK of percent 18.6% (Fig. 3C). The second step of degradation begin at 598\u202fK and is finished at 648\u202fK.\n\n\n\nSorption studies\nSorption time, pH, initial U(VI) concentration, dose and temperature were optimized and expressed as removal percent (R%) of U (VI) ion on the adsorbent. The uptake of uranium increases with increasing time until it reaches a certain time (100\u202fmin), no noticeable change occurs with increase in time due to saturation of adsorption sites [32,33]. The pH parameter is very important in the adsorption of U(VI) ions because of its ability to change the ionic forms of uranyl ions. Uranium uptake was raised with increasing the pH until reaching a maximum value at pH 4 and then decreased (Table 2\n). Lower adsorption of uranium ions at low pH values is due to the competition with H+ on the surface of flax fiber [34]. When pH values increase beyond pH 4 the percentage removal decreases due to the creation of other forms (UO2(OH)2) or precipitation. Also, the effect of ionic strength on U(VI) adsorption was studied and the result indicates that the uptake of U(VI) ions on flax fibers is feebly reliant on ionic strength along the pH range. Table 2, demonstrates that the removal percent of uranium ions remains at its maximum value; 100%, between 100 and 600\u202fmg\/l initial concentration and then it decreases as U (VI) concentration is raised, due to a decrease in the adsorption sites on the surface of flax fiber [35]. The effect of flax fiber dose on the U(VI) uptake was explained in the range 0.2 to 1.6\u202fg. Table 2, shows that the removal percent increased with increasing the dose due to the increase in sorption sites. Until it reaches a certain limit (1.0\u202fg) there will be no further increase in the uptake percentage [36,37]. Keeping all other parameters constant, the uptake of uranium increased slightly with increasing the temperature up to 323\u202fK and then it started decreasing at temperatures from 323 to 333\u202fK as shown in Table 2. This refers to both endothermic from 301 to 323\u202fK and exothermic in nature from 323 to 333\u202fK.\n\n\nIsotherms studies\nFive isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Redlich-Peterson and Jovanovic model) were used to explain the equilibrium uptake of uranium ions on flax fiber and the isotherm parameters were estimated by linear and nonlinear systems. The achieved isotherm parameters determined by nonlinear methods are good fitting than those acquired by linear methods because the non linear methods overcome the inaccuracy of the results using the original isotherm equations [38,39].\n\nLangmuir model\nThis isotherm is used to determine the monolayer uptake of U (VI) onto flax fiber and is described by the following equations [35]:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\nNon - linear\n\n:\n\nq\ne\n\n=\n\n(\n\nQ\nL\n\n\nK\nL\n\n\nC\ne\n\n)\n\n\/\n\n(\n1\n+\n\nK\nL\n\n\nC\ne\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\nLinear:\n\n\nC\ne\n\n\/\n\nq\ne\n\n=\n1\n\/\n\n(\n\nQ\nL\n\n\nK\nL\n\n)\n\n+\n\nC\ne\n\n\/\n\nQ\nL\n\n\n\n\nwhere, Ce is the U(VI) concentration at equilibrium (mg\/L).

[15,40]:\n\n(13)\n\n\n\nNon - linear\n\n:\n\n\nq\ne\n\n=\n\n(\nR\nT\n\/\nH\n)\n\nln\n\nK\nT\n\n\nC\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(14)\n\n\nLinear\n:\n\n\nq\ne\n\n=\n\n(\nR\nT\n\/\nH\n)\n\nln\n\nK\nT\n\n+\n\n(\nR\nT\n\/\nH\n)\n\nln\n\nC\ne\n\n\n\n\nwhere KT (L\/g), R, T and H (J\/mol) are constants of Temkin model (L\/g), universal gas constant (8.314\u202fJ\/mol\/K), temperature (K) and constant related to sorption heat (J\/mol), respectively.\n\n\nRedlich-Peterson model\nThis model describes adsorption equilibrium in excess of adsorbate concentration which is appropriate in either homogenous or heterogeneous processes and expressed by the following eq. [37]:\n\n(15)\n\n\n\nNon - linear\n\n:\n\n\nq\ne\n\n=\n\nK\n\nRP\n\n\n\nC\ne\n\n\/\n\n(\n1\n+\nA\n\n\n\nC\ne\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(16)\n\n\nLinear\n:\n\nln\n\n[\n\nK\n\nRP\n\n\n\n(\n\nC\ne\n\n\/\n\nq\ne\n\n)\n\n-\n1\n]\n\n=\nln\nA\n+\n\u03b2\nln\n\nC\ne\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere KRP (L\/g) and A (L.\/mg)\n\u03b2\n are the constant of Redlich-Peterson model. The item \u03b2 is the exponent related to adsorption energy\n\n\nJovanovic model\nJovanovic model is predicated on the assumptions limited in the Langmuir model, but also the option of a little mechanical associates among the sorbate and sorbent and expressed by the following eq. [40]:\n\n(17)\n\n\n\nNon - linear\n\n:\n\nq\ne\n\n=\n\nq\nmax\n\n\n(\n1\n-\nexp\n\n\n(\n\nK\nJ\n\n\nC\ne\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(18)\n\n\nLinear\n:\n\nln\n\nq\ne\n\n=\nln\n\nq\nmax\n\n-\n\nK\nJ\n\n\nC\ne\n\n\n\n\nwhere qmax is maximum uptake of sorbate (mg\/g), and KJ is the Jovanovic constant (L\/mg).\nThe linear and nonlinear parameters of adsorption isotherms are listed in Table 3\n. The results of the linear analysis show that the Langmuir model appears to be the best fitting model for U(VI) uptake on flax fiber with higher correlation coefficient (R2) than other models indicating that U(VI) ions are adsorbed onto flax fiber as monolayer surface adsorption. Fig. 4\n shows the plot of non-linear isotherms obtained at 323\u202fK. The results obtained by the non-linear method confirmed that the Langmuir model is the most suitable model than other models for the adsorption process as the adsorption capacity results are consistent with the results of experiments and also the value of correlation coefficient (R2) and chi-square analysis (\u03c72) are greater than other isotherms.\n\n\n\nAdsorption kinetics\nThe results of the linear and non linear kinetic studies (Table 4\n), show that the value of theoretical adsorption capacity (qe) of pseudo first order kinetics and Elovich model do not fit the experimental result. But, a good agreement was obtained with pseudo second order rate (Fig. 5\n). For pseudo second order model, the parameters are similar to those achieved by the linear technique. The These results explain that the process of uranium uptake on flax fibers corresponds or follows the pseudo second order model and the higher value of correlation coefficient confirm this result.\n\n\nThermodynamic studies\nEnthalpy change (\u0394Ho), Free energy change (\u0394Go) and entropy change (\u0394So) were calculated from the following eqs. [32,35]:\n\n(19)\n\n\n\u0394\n\nG\no\n\n=\n-\nR\nT\nlog\n\nK\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(20)\n\n\n\u0394\n\nG\no\n\n=\n\u0394\n\nH\no\n\n-\nT\n\u0394\n\nS\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(21)\n\n\nlog\n\nK\nc\n\n=\n\u0394\n\nS\no\n\n\/\n2.303\nR\n-\n\u0394\n\nH\no\n\n\/\n2.303\nR\nT\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\nT: Temperature (K)\n\n\nR: Gas constant (8.314 J \/mol.

If \u0394H0\u202f>\u202f0 (positive) the process is endothermic in nature and the U(VI) uptake increases with rise the temperature. On the other hand, if \u0394H0\u202f<\u202f0 (negative) the process is exothermic in nature and the U(VI) uptake decreases with rise in the temperature as a result of breaking the bonds formed by high temperature[7]. Table 5\n, shows that \u0394G\u00b0 was negative and increases by increasing the temperature from 301 to 323\u202fK (Fig. 6a), then decreased after 323\u202fK (Fig. 6b), which indicate the favorability of uranium uptake at lower temperature. The reason for the endothermic nature (from 301 to 323\u202fK) is the increase in the pores of the fiber by heating effect, which leads to the emergence of active sites on the surface of the fiber which increase the interaction of UO2\n2+ with the functional groups (OH group, CH bonds and CO group) of the cell walls of flax fibers by the ion exchange of H+ on the surface with UO2\n2+. Besides, spread free UO2\n2+ into the pores of the fibers(electrostatic interaction) [41]. While the exothermic system (from 323 to 333\u202fK) is due to the release of uranium ions from the active sites on the fiber surface due to weak or broken in the interaction between UO2\n2+and the functional groups responsible for bonding. The positive \u0394H\u00b0 from 301 to 323\u202fK, refers to an endothermic behavior, and negative \u0394H\u00b0 in the range 323 to 333\u202fK, indicates an exothermic behavior. Positive \u0394So refers to random uptake of uranium ions onto flax fibers.\n\n\nDesorption process\nThe recovery of U (VI) from loaded adsorbent material (flax fiber) was performed using five different desorption solutions (HNO3, HCl, H2SO4, Na2CO3 and H2O) at room temperature (Fig. 7\n). Firstly, loaded flax fiber was treated with 50\u202fmL (1.5\u202fM of HNO3, HCl, H2SO4, and Na2CO3) of each eluting solution in thermostatic shaker bath for 1\u202fh at 301\u202fK. Water has a weak effect as eluting agent in the desorption of uranium ions from fibers because it removes the uranium ions of very weak interaction with both pores and surface. Proton exchanging agent is the main mechanism of desorption process. The HNO3 is also able to dissolve uranium to form the soluble form. Desorption process occurs by the replacement of uranium ions on the surface and pores of flax fiber by H+ and U(VI) ions are released to the bulk solution. Fig. 7, shows higher desorption when HNO3 is used. Therefore, HNO3 was selected as the best desorbing agent for recovering U (VI) ions. Desorption (%) was calculated according to the following eq.:\n\n(22)\n\n\nDesorption\n\n\n%\n\n\n=\n\n\n\ndesorption\u00a0ions\n\n\/\nadsorption\u00a0ions\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovering process\nUranium ion in desorption liquid was recovered by adding ammonium solution, NH4OH (35%) until reacheding to pH 8. The form product (ammonium diurinate) was then filtered and heated at 1073\u202fK to obtain uranium oxide [34]. The residue after cooling is screened and examined by environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) (Fig. 8\n). This analysis indicates that the content of uranium as U3O8 in the sintered yellow cake reached 98.83%.\n\n\nThe regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent material\nThe regenerated flax fibers were reused in the recycle process to study the change in its adsorption capacity. The results of adsorption \u2013 desorption cycles are given in Table 6\n. The results show a lowering in adsorption percent with increase in desorption cycles. Table 7\n, shows the U(VI) uptake by flax fiber and other adsorbents from liquid waste. The comparison of adsorption capacity values between flax fibers and other materials confirms that flax fibers exhibit an acceptable absorption capacity of U(VI) from aqueous solutions. The block diagram of U(VI) uptake using flax fiber in the batch technique was shown in Fig. 9\n.\n\n\n\nDesign of batch adsorber\nThe data required to design a full scale of batch unit for removal of uranium ion from liquid wastes were determined from the results of the best adsorption isotherm model which [36]. In this work, a full-scale unit of batch technique was designed from data of Langmuir isotherm. Fig. 10\na shows a technique of batch-unit for U (VI) adsorption using flax fiber.\nIf that a liquid volume V (m3) of U (VI) of initial concentration C0 (mg\/l), was treated to a finial concentration Ce (mg\/l) using adsorbent mass M (g). Adsorption capacity of flax fiber was increased from q0 at time 0 to qe at equilibrium. The balance equation of batch-unit, was determined as follows:\n\n(23)\n\n\nV\n\n(\n\nC\n0\n\n-\n\nC\ne\n\n)\n\n=\nM\n\n(\n\nq\ne\n\n-\n\nq\n0\n\n)\n\n=\nM\n\nq\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen, q0\u202f=\u202f0, Eq.

(22) is used to determine both flax fiber doses and the volume of wastewater introduced in the full scale batch unit (Fig. 10b). Design data indicated that flax fiber has a good potential for adsorbing high concentrations of U (VI) ions from liquid wastes.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFlax fiber showed to be an acceptable adsorbent material for removal and recovery of U (VI) with higher liquid concentrations. Equilibrium uranium capacity of flax fiber was 40.9\u202fmg\/g at pH 4 and 323\u202fK. Thermo studies showed that the uptake of U(VI) is an endothermic process between 301\u202fK and 323\u202fK and exothermic in nature from 323\u202fK to 333\u202fK. The adsorption data obtained by linear and nonlinear showed both the Langmuir and pseudo second order models are the best fitting models. Regeneration process of flax fibers have proved a lowering in adsorption percent with increase in desorption cycles. A full scale batch adsorber unit is designed using the best adsorption isotherm model.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects\n\n","54":"\n\nIntroduction\nOver the past 10\u00a0years, topological insulators (TIs) [1\u20135] have received widespread attention from researchers around the world. Due to the band inversion effect [6], the topological insulator has peculiar topological elements, that is, the bulk material exhibits insulating properties, and the surface state exhibits metallic properties. In recent years, investigation of the topological elements has been extended to three-dimensional (3D) semimetal materials [7\u201311]. This type of material exhibits excellent physical properties [12\u201314] (Weyl fermion quantum transport and Hall effects) because it contains different types of topological elements. Therefore, following the TIs, topological semimetals (TSMs) can be regarded as a rising star in the field of quantum materials.\nTo date, three types of TSMs, namely, Dirac semimetals (DSs), Weyl semimetals (WSs), and topological nodal line semimetals (TNLSs), have been predicted in theory. 3D DSs [15\u201318], including a four-fold degeneracy point near the Fermi level (E\nF), can resist external disturbances because they are protected by crystal symmetry and time reversal symmetry (T). Some theoretical works [18\u201320] have been done, and these efforts have greatly enriched the members of the 3D DS family. It must be mentioned that some novel topological elements predicted by theory have been experimentally confirmed. For example, Neupane et al. [21] systematically studied the electronic structure of Cd3As2 by means of high-resolution angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), and they stated that the Cd3As2 system contains many unusual topological phases. Also, in 3D Na3Bi, Liu et al [22] detected 3D Dirac fermions by ARPES with linear dispersion along all the momentum directions. If T or reverse symmetry is broken, the 3D DS will evolve into a WS [23]. The well-known WS materials are the TaAs family, and their special topological elements have been experimentally confirmed [24].\nFor Dirac semimetals and WSs, their crossing points (CPs) are distributed at different k points in the Brillouin zone (BZ), while the CPs near the Fermi level (E\nF) of the TNLS will form a closed loop [25\u201330]. Many different families and different types of TNLSs are theoretically predicted. Normally, the TNLSs can be roughly divided into three categories, i.e., type I TNLS, type II TNLS, and critical type TNLS [27]. A schematic diagram of these three cases is given in Fig. 1\nc\u2013e. For critical type TNLSs (see Fig. 1b), their distinguishing feature is the presence of energy bands feature an intersection between a horizontal and a dispersive band. In type I TNLSs, these bands (see Fig. 1c) exhibit a traditional conical dispersion in which the electron and hole regions are well separated by energy. In type II TNLSs (see Fig. 1e), these bands are fully tilted, and their electron and hole states coexist at a given energy. Different types of TNLSs have different special properties [29,31], although the different types of TNLSs have a common topological element, namely, the drum-head-like (DHL) surface states [32\u201334]. Such a two-dimensional (2D) flat surface band state provides another possible way to achieve high temperature superconductivity [35]. Therefore, searching for new, especially synthetic, TNLSs is very necessary. In this work, we will focus on an old synthesized CsCl-type [36] binary alloy, TiOs. The first observation of the ordered CsCl type TiOs system was reported in the work of Laves and Wallbaum [37]. The lattice parameters obtained experimentally by Laves and Wallbaum were a\u00a0=\u00a0b\u00a0=\u00a0c\u00a0=\u00a03.07\u00a0\u00c5. Also, Eremenko [38] observed that TiOs melts congruently at 2160 \u2103 by differential thermal analysis. The lattice parameters obtained by Eremenko in 1966 were a\/b\/c\u00a0=\u00a03.081\u00a0\u00c5. In this work, by means of first-principles, the lattice parameters of CsCl-type TiOs were optimized, and the calculated results were a\/b\/c\u00a0=\u00a03.806\u00a0\u00c5. The results in this current work are in good agreement with their experimental values mentioned above.\nBased on first principles, we predict that TiOs alloy with the CsCl type structure is a TNLS with three type I nodal lines (NLs) that are perpendicular to each other. What is more, interesting DHL surface band states can be observed when the spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) effect is absent. The effects of uniform strain and hole\/electron doping on the electronic structures will also be investigated in detail. In addition, the band structures of CsCl type ZrOs and HfOs alloys have been studied using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) methods, respectively.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nIn this study, the electronic structures of [Ti\/Zr\/Hf]Os have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT), within the VASP code [39]. The DFT method has proven to be one of the most accurate methods for computation of the electronic structure of solids [40\u201346]. We also used the projector augmented wave (PAW) method to deal with the interaction between the ion cores and the valence electrons. The PBE [47] parameterization of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [48] was selected to describe the exchange and correlation functionals. For the CsCl type [Ti\/Zr\/Hf]Os systems, a plane-wave basis set cut-off of 500\u00a0eV and a Monkhorst-Pack special 15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0k-point mesh were used in the BZ integration. The unit cell was optimized until the force and total energy were less than 0.005\u00a0eV\/\u00c5 and 0.0000001\u00a0eV, respectively. The surface states of TiOs were investigated in this study via the WannierTools software [49], according to the method of maximally localized Wannier functions [50,51].\nAs an example, the crystal structure of CsCl type TiOs is exhibited in Fig. 1(f), and one can see that the Ti occupies the (0.5,0.5,0.5) site, while the Os occupied the (0,0,0) site. A phonon energy calculation of [Ti\/Zr\/Hf]Os at their equilibrium lattice constants was performed in NanoAcademic Device Calculator (Nanodcal) code [52]. The results are given in Fig. 2\n(a\u2013c), and there is no virtual frequency in their phonon band structures, indicating that these compounds in this study are theoretically stable.\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nFig. 1(a) exhibits the selected high symmetry points, i.e., \u0393-X-M-\u0393-R-X, in the BZ for CsCl type TiOs alloy. Based on these high symmetry points, the band structures of [Ti\/Zr\/Hf]Os alloys without SOC via the PBE method were calculated, and the results arecollected in Fig. 3\n(a\u2013c). From them, one can see that there are three CPs near the E\nF in total, and they are along \u0393-X, X-M, and R-X, respectively. These CPs are composed of two dispersions, and the two dispersion bands form a traditional conical dispersion at the CP, indicating that these CPs are of the first type (see Fig. 1c). What we need to point out is that this Ti\/Hf\/ZrOs system is protected by T and spatial inversion (P) symmetry, and the spin-less Hamiltonian is always real valued [27], so the observed three CPs in Fig. 3(a)\u2013(c) cannot exist in isolation. Instead, they should belong to a TNL or other types of TN structures. In order to explain this more clearly, in Fig. 4\n(a) the energy band structure diagram of CsCl-type TiOs in the R-X-M direction is given. From it, one can see two CPs, one along the R-X direction and the other one along the X-M direction, in the k\nz\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\u03c0\n\n plane. A schematic diagram of the TNL (k\nz\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c0 plane) where the two CPs are located is also given in Fig. 4(c). Therefore, one can draw the conclusion that an X-centered TNL is formed in the k\nz\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\u03c0\n\n plane. Due to the cubic symmetry of the material itself, it is easy to see that there are also two equivalent TNLs that can be observed in the k\nx\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\u03c0\n\nplane and the k\ny\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\u03c0\n\n plane (see Fig. 5\n(a)). The TNLs are located in the mirror-invariant plane, and these TNLs enjoy the protection of the mirror symmetry Mx, My, and Mz, as the three CPs feature opposite Mx, My, and Mz eigenvalues.\nAs shown in Fig. 4(a), one can see that that the CPs along the R-X and X-M paths are type I. To further illustrate that all the CPs along the whole first BZ and the X-centered TNL in the k\nz\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\u03c0\n\n plane are type I, a more detailed calculation was also performed. For CsCl type TiOs, there are fourfold rotation symmetry and mirror symmetry in the k\nz\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\u03c0\n\n plane, so we do not need to calculate the energy band structure for the whole first BZ. Instead, we can use 1\/8 part to reflect the nature of the overall BZ, as shown in Fig. 5(b). We divided the 1\/8 BZ into 5 parts, so in addition to X-R and X-M, we also selected the four additional directions X-A, X-B, X-C, and X-D. The band structures of TiOs along X-M, X-A, X-B, X-C, X-D, and X-R are given in Fig. 5(c)\u2013(h), respectively. From the figures, one can see that all the CPs along these above-mentioned paths belong to the type I nodal points, and therefore, the TNL in the k\nz\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\u03c0\n\n plane can also be seen as type I. Noted that a similar situation was reported for CaTe by Du et al. [53] They found that CaTe is a TNLS with three TNLs when the SOC is absent. These three lines are also perpendicular to each other and focused on the M point.\nBased on our above discussion, one can conclude that TiOs, ZrOs, and HfOs alloys are newly predicted TNLSs without the SOC effect as calculated by the PBE method. In order to make our results more accurate, the calculations of the band structures of Ti\/Zr\/HfOs were repeated using the state-of-the-art HSE06 [54] functional, and the results are exhibited in Fig. 3(d)\u2013(f). Unfortunately, for ZrOs and HfOs, the three CPs observed under the PBE method disappeared, and these CPs were converted into three energy gaps. This means that, when using HSE 06, one cannot theoretically observe the novel topological elements of ZrOs and HfOs. For TiOs compound, however, the three CPs still occurred under the HSE 06 method. The DFT+Hubbard correction (DFT+U) calculation for the TiOs system was also carried out in this work, and the results are given in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information. Therefore, in the following part of this study, we only focus on one material, namely, TiOs, and study its novel physical properties.\nThe calculated orbital-resolved band structures of TiOs are shown in Fig. 6\n, where the three CPs are formed by two bands crossing each other, which we have marked as Band 1 and Band 2 (see Fig. 6). Band 1 mainly arises from the Ti-d orbitals, and Band 2 mainly comes from the Os-d orbitals. Therefore, the three CPs are formed by the hybridization between the Ti-d and Os-d orbitals.\nIn nodal point-type topological materials, their surface states exhibit a Fermi arc type structure. Unlike the topological elements of this class of materials, the surface states of the TNLS should be DHL-type. To confirm the existence of these particular nontrivial topological, i.e., DHL, surface states, we calculated the projected spectrum of the TiOs (0\u00a00\u00a01) surface along \n\n\nR\n~\n\n-\n\nX\n~\n\n-\n\nM\n~\n\n\n in the surface BZ (see Fig. 1(b)), and the obtained results are given in Fig. 4(b). In this Figure, we use two yellow balls to indicate the location of the two band CPs (BCPs) along the R-X-M path, and we use black arrows to highlight the DHL surface states. From the figure, one can clearly see that some DHL surface states are located inside or outside the bulk TNLs. Remarkably, between the two BCPs, the DHL surface state appears to be nearly flat. Based on Kopnin et al.'s work [35], a two-dimensional flat surface state is expected to be a good way to achieve high temperature superconductivity. We hope that the interesting DHL surface states in TiOs can be confirmed by ARPES and scanning tunneling microscopy in the near future.\nThe effect of uniform strain on the band structure of TiOs was investigated and the results are given in Fig. 7\n. The optimized lattice constants under different uniform strains can be seen in Table S1. As shown in Fig. 7(a)\u2013(d), 1\u00a0GPa, 6\u00a0GPa, 10\u00a0GPa, and 20\u00a0GPa, respectively, were added during the calculations of band structures. In order to verify whether the TiOs is still stable under different uniform strains, the phonon band structures under different strains were calculated. As an example, a phonon band structure at 20 GPa is given in Fig. 2(d), and one can see that there is no imaginary frequency present, reflecting the proposition that TiOs under these uniform strains are still stable in terms of theory. From Fig. 7, one can see that the CPs are still maintained, and therefore, the TNL bulk and DHL surface states still exist in CsCl type TiOs under uniform strains ranging from 0 GPa to 20 GPa.\nIn this work, we will also focus on the effects of electron and hole doping (with a doping concentration of 0.025 carrier per atom [55]) on the band structures of TiOs. The calculated results are given in Fig. 8\n, where one can see that the shape of the band structure of TiOs did not change except for a slight increase (hole-doping induced) or decrease (electron-doping induced) in the vicinity of the E\nF, which indicates that the excellent topological elements, such as the CPs, the TNLs, and the DHL states, in the TiOs system exhibit strong resistance to both the hole doping effect and the electron doping effect. Usually, the Fermi level position, and thereby the carrier concentration, can be adjusted by the use of a gate voltage [56,57].\nBefore closing, we want to discuss the effects of spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) on the TiOs system because this system contains heavy elements. Generally, the SOC effect will drive the TNL states into other different topological phases. To the best of our knowledge, many TNLSs were predicted without considering the effect of the SOC (see Table S2), even though, a transition from the TNL state to an other topological state can be found when the SOC is further added because the SOC generally lifts the degeneracy on the nodal lines. For TiOs, SOC-induced gaps can be found, and the results are exhibited in Fig. 9\n. Along the X-M and R-X paths, the values of the opened gaps are comparable to that of CaAgAs [58], although the SOC-induced gap along \u0393-X is somewhat larger than that of CaAgAs. In order to further confirm that the topological properties still are maintained in TiOs when the SOC effect is involved, the projected spectrum of the TiOs (0\u00a00\u00a01) surface under the influence of SOC is given in Fig. 10\n. From it, one can observe that the surface Dirac cone has appeared, which confirms the occurrence of the nontrivial topological property even when the SOC effect is considered.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, we have predicted that CsCl-type TiOs, ZrOs, and HfOs compounds are TNLSs in the absence of the SOC effect with the PBE method. Under the HSE06 method, however, only the TNL states and the CPs in TiOs are maintained, and novel DHL surface states can be found inside and outside the bulk TNL states of TiOs. With more detailed computations, we can conclude that there are three TNLs centered at the\u00a0X\u00a0point and that these TNLs (in the k\nx\/y\/z\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\u03c0\n\n plane) are perpendicular to one another. These TNLs are protected by the T, P, and mirror symmetries. By calculating the orbital-resolved band structures, one can see that the CPs, and even the TNLs, are formed by the hybridization between the Ti-d and Os-d orbitals. The effects of uniform strain, hole doping and electron doping on the electronic structures were investigated, and the calculated results showed that the TNLs are very robust with respect to the above-mentioned effects. SOC-induced gaps can be found in this system, and the gaps almost comparable with that of CaAgAs compound. Surface Dirac cones can be found in this system when the SOC is taken into consideration, indicating that the topological properties are still maintained. Importantly, TiOs was alloy is easy to synthesize, and its crystal properties have already been well studied experimentally. It is hoped that our current work will bring this old material back to the attention of researchers.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","55":"\n\nIntroduction\n\nAcanthamoeba spp. are free-living, ubiquitous protozoa found mainly in humid soil and in water reservoirs. They are the causative agents of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a vision-threatening corneal infection first reported in 1973 in the United States [1]. Acanthamoeba trophozoites are relatively responsive to many therapies, while Acanthamoeba cysts are well suited to survive extreme environmental conditions, including medications. The highly resistant cyst form makes AK treatment difficult [2].\nAK has a high cure rate if diagnosis could be made as early as possible [3]. If diagnosis is delayed, AK can become refractory to traditional treatment, particularly at later stages when the infection penetrates the deep stroma. There is no consensus on the treatment for AK till now. A recent study compared the therapeutic effect of different topical antiamoebic agents (0.02% polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) monotherapy, 0.02% PHMB\u00a0+\u00a00.1% diamidine, 0.02% PHMB\u00a0+\u00a00.02% chlorhexidine\u00a0+\u00a00.1% diamidine, and 0.1% diamidine monotherapy), which showed that 0.02% PHMB monotherapy for the initial treatment of AK is as effective as biguanide\u00a0+\u00a0diamidine combination therapy [4]. Nevertheless, current conventional therapies for AK are 0.02% biguanide (PHMB or chlorhexidine) in combination with a 0.1% diamidine (propamidine isethionate or hexamidine) applied hourly for at least 1\u00a0week and then tapered weekly according to the patient\u2019s clinical response [5,6]. For patients with late diagnosis and poor drug responses, alcohol-assisted epithelial debridement can be performed as an adjuvant therapy to avoid therapeutic keratoplasty [6].\nIntrastromal injection of antimicrobial agents may be promising adjunctive treatments for deep recalcitrant microbial keratitis, which responds poorly to conventional treatment modalities [7\u201310]. However, this strategy has not been tested in AK due to suspicions of drug toxicity. The concentration-dependent corneal toxicities of antiamoebic agents have been previously reported [11], but their toxicity after corneal intrastromal injection remains untested. Therefore, in this study, we have investigated corneal toxicity in rabbit eyes after intrastromal injection of PHMB and propamidine isethionate, to determine safe concentrations for AK treatment. With safe dosages, intrastromal injection of PHMB or propamidine isethionate could represent promising adjuvant therapies for deep AK.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research and were approved by the University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU).\n\nPreparation of PHMB and propamidine isethionate\nTwo antiamoebic agents were used in our study. PHMB is a synthetic cationic polymer composed of repeating basic biguanide units connected by hexamethylene hydrocarbon chains [12] and propamidine isethionate is a polyether compound known as bis(4-guanidinophenyl) ether of propane-1,3-diol, which works through inhibiting synthesis of DNA, RNA, phospholipids, and proteins [13]. PHMB (Cosmocil CQ 20%, Avecia Biocides, U.K.) was diluted to 0.02 and 0.01%. Propamidine isethionate (0.1%; Brolene eyedrops; Sanofi-Aventis, Australia) was used as supplied, and also diluted to 0.05%.\n\n\nAnimals\nThe right eyes of 12 New Zealand white rabbits were intrastromally injected with 0.1\u00a0mL of 0.02% PHMB, 0.01% PHMB, 0.1% propamidine isethionate, or 0.05% propamidine isethionate (n\u00a0=\u00a03 per treatment). The left eyes served as controls and were subjected to intrastromal injection of 0.1\u00a0mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\n\nCorneal intrastromal injection\nRabbits were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (20\u00a0mg\/kg) and xylazine (10\u00a0mg\/kg) before intrastromal injection. Topical anesthesia was provided using Alcaine (proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%; Alcon, Fort Worth, TX). Under a surgical microscope, intrastromal injection of 0.1\u00a0mL of solution was performed by 30-gauge needle at three different sites in the paracentral corneal stroma. The animals were sacrificed 7\u00a0days after intrastromal injection by intravenous injection of a lethal dose of pentobarbital. The corneal buttons were harvested and examined by slit lamp microscopy, specular microscopy (SM), Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and cell viability test.\n\n\nIsolation and culture of corneal cells\nIsolated rabbit corneal endothelial cells were incubated with 0.5\u00a0g\/L trypsin-0.2\u00a0g\/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Invitrogen-Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. Descemet\u2019s layer was removed by mechanical dissection under the microscope. Endothelial cells were cultured in 25\u00a0cm2 culture flasks containing Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma-Aldrich), 24\u00a0mg\/mL adenine, 4\u00a0mM L-glutamine, 1% antibiotic solution (Invitrogen-Gibco), and growth factors (0.4\u00a0mg\/mL hydrocortisone, 1.3\u00a0ng\/mL triiodothyronine, 8\u00a0ng\/mL cholera toxin, and 5\u00a0mg\/mL insulin). The culture medium was changed every 3\u00a0days. To isolate rabbit corneal stromal keratocytes, the corneal epithelial and endothelial layers were removed carefully by mechanical scraping. The remaining stroma was cut into small explants approximately 3\u00a0mm in size, which were placed in plastic culture dishes to allow keratocyte growth. The growth media was DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 4\u00a0mM L-glutamine, and 1% antibiotic solution. The culture medium was changed every 3\u00a0days.\n\n\n\nExaminations\n\nSlit lamp microscopy\nThe rabbits\u2019 corneas were examined by slit lamp microscopy to evaluate the presence of possible corneal changes, including corneal edema, epithelial erosion, corneal neovascularization, and corneal haze 7\u00a0days after intrastromal injection.\n\n\nSpecular microscopy (SM)\nEndothelial cell counts were measured on a Konan KSS-EB10 SM (Konan Medical USA, Irvine, CA) 7\u00a0days after intrastromal injection. The endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation (CV), and percentage of hexagonal cells (6A%) were determined in at least 50 endothelial cells per replicate.\n\n\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining\nWe prepared 6-\u03bcm sections from corneas, stained them with H&E, and imaged them under a light microscope (E-800 Leica, Solms, Germany) equipped with a digital video camera (Nikon DS-Ri1, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nCorneal specimens were rinsed with PBS and immediately immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for at least 24\u00a0h. The specimens were then rinsed with Milli-Q (MQ) water three times for 5\u00a0min each, and transferred to 1% tannic acid for 60\u00a0min at room temperature. The specimens were subsequently rinsed with MQ water three times for 5\u00a0min each. The samples were then dehydrated by immersion in a graduated ethanol series according to the following scheme (5\u00a0min each): 30% (once), 50% (once), 70% (once), 95% (twice), and 100% (three times). After dehydration, specimens were soaked in hexamethyldisilazane for 15\u00a0min, then placed in an empty desiccator and left in a fume hood overnight at room temperature. The specimens were coated with gold and ultrastructural changes were evaluated using an SEM at different magnifications.\n\n\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay\nThe TUNEL assay was used to quantitatively detect apoptosis in the corneas, using the Roche In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, AP. Briefly, dewaxed and rehydrated tissue sections were incubated with Proteinase K working solution for 15\u201330\u00a0min at room temperature. Slides were rinsed with PBS and the area around the samples was dried with filter paper. The lid was added and the cells were incubated in TUNEL reaction mixture (50\u00a0\u00b5L per well) for 60\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in the dark. The slides were subsequently rinsed three times with PBS. The samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope using an excitation wavelength in the range of 450\u2013500\u00a0nm and detection in the range of 515\u2013565\u00a0nm (green). TUNEL-positive nuclei appeared green, while TUNEL-negative nuclei appeared blue.\n\n\nCell viability assay\nThe viability of keratocytes and endothelial cells was assessed using the WST-1 (Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt-1) assay (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). We prepared a cell suspension containing 0.1\u20131.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells\/mL in medium, added 100\u00a0\u00b5L of the suspension to the wells of a 96-well cell culture plate, and incubated the plate for 24\u201396\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for cell culture. Then, 10\u00a0\u00b5L of CytoSelect\u2122 WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay Reagent was added to each well, and the plate incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 0.5\u20134\u00a0h. Absorbance was measured at 450\u00a0nm using a plate reader.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical significance was analyzed using the Student\u2019s t-test. P values\u00a0<\u00a00.05 were considered statistically significant. All data are expressed as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nSlit lamp examination\nEyes were evaluated 7\u00a0days after intrastromal injection. Corneas injected with PBS were clear in appearance (Fig. 1\nA), while corneal edema, epithelial erosion, and severe neovascularization were observed with 0.02% PHMB treatment (Fig. 1B). Corneas injected with 0.01% PHMB were also clear under slit lamp examination (Fig. 1C). For propamidine isethionate, the 0.1% solution resulted in corneal edema with epithelial erosion, but no neovascularization was observed (Fig. 1D). No corneal edema or erosion was observed with 0.05% propamidine isethionate (Fig. 1E).\n\n\nH&E staining\nHistological sections of the corneas were observed by H&E staining. In control corneas treated with PBS, no obvious changes were observed (Fig. 1F). However, massive inflammatory cell invasion and neovascularization were observed after 0.02% PHMB injection (Fig. 1G). With 0.01% PHMB, the stroma was thickened, but no inflammatory cells were observed (Fig. 1H). In corneas injected with 0.1% propamidine isethionate, enlarged stromal spaces containing few inflammatory cells were observed (Fig. 1I), while no obvious changes were observed with 0.05% propamidine isethionate treatment (Fig. 1J).\n\n\nScanning electron microscopy\nWith PBS treatment, the collagen fibrils of the stroma were regularly arranged (Fig. 1K). Arrangements of collagenous lamellae were distorted with 0.02% PHMB (Fig. 1L), while no structural damage was observed after 0.01% PHMB (Fig. 1M). There were also disarrangements of collagen fibrils with 0.1% propamidine isethionate injection (Fig. 1N), but no structural change was found after 0.05% propamidine isethionate treatment (Fig. 1O).\n\n\nCorneal endothelium toxicity\nWe used SM to count the endothelial cells after intrastromal injection of PHMB or propamidine isethionate. Unfortunately, the 0.02% PHMB images were too blurry for analysis, and the endothelial cells could not be counted. However, specular microphotographs were obtained for the PBS, 0.01% PHMB, 0.1% propamidine isethionate, and 0.05% propamidine isethionate treatments (Fig. 2\n), and the cell densities were 3476.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032.4, 3185.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a086.8, 3327.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a095.3, and 3431.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a057.9 cells\/mm2, respectively (All P\u00a0>\u00a00.05 vs. the control (PBS)). We observed cytotoxicity to corneal endothelial cells with 0.02% PHMB intrastromal injections, while intrastromal injection with 0.01% PHMB, 0.1% propamidine isethionate, and 0.05% propamidine isethionate did not cause significant decreases in corneal endothelial cells.\n\n\nTUNEL assay\nTUNEL-positive keratocytes, which indicate keratocyte apoptosis, were detected with 0.02% PHMB and 0.1% propamidine isethionate treatment, while no keratocyte apoptosis was observed with 0.01% PHMB and 0.05% propamidine isethionate (Fig. 3\n).\n\n\nCell viability assay\nPHMB and propamidine isethionate-treated corneal stromal keratocytes and endothelial cells exhibited significant dose- and time-dependent decreases in viability (Fig. 4\n). PHMB had higher cell toxicity compared with propamidine isethionate. In a previous report, the combination of a low (0.00125%) concentration of PHMB with the autophagy inhibitors showed low cytopathic effects on human corneal cells and high cytopathic effects on Acanthamoeba cells [11]. Therefore, we used 0.00125% as our lowest concentration for PHMB in the WST-1 assay. When the PHMB concentration was decreased to 0.00125%, almost no toxicity was observed in corneal stromal keratocytes or endothelial cells (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Similarly, when the propamidine isethionate concentration was decreased to 0.05%, almost no toxicity was observed in corneal stromal keratocytes cells (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that diffuse and deep acanthamoeba cyst infiltration increases the need for therapeutic keratoplasty [14]. Intrastromal injection with antibiotics has been used to treat deep bacterial and fungal keratitis, but intrastromal injection of antiamoebic agents has never been tested for the treatment of deep stromal AK. Theoretically, intrastromal injection of PHMB or propamidine isethionate may be an alternative treatment for patients with deep stromal AK who are unresponsive to topical anti-Acanthamoeba agents, decreasing the need for therapeutic keratoplasty. In addition, in patients requiring therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), graft failure associated with AK recurrence due to residual viable cysts inside the recipient corneal stroma is not uncommon. Pre-operative intrastromal injection with PHMB or propamidine isethionate could potentially eradicate cysts in the deep stroma, reducing recurrence rates after PKP. However, there is limited data on the toxicity of PHMB and propamidine isethionate when administered via intrastromal injection. In this study, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro corneal toxicities of different concentrations of PHMB and propamidine isethionate, in an attempt to identify effective but nontoxic concentrations for intrastromal injection.\nConventional AK treatment concentrations are 0.02% PHMB and 0.1% propamidine isethionate [2]; however, we observed significant corneal toxicity at these concentrations. Conversely, intrastromal injection of 0.01% PHMB or 0.05% propamidine isethionate was safe for the corneas. In clinical treatment, 0.02% PHMB and 0.1% propamidine isethionate will encounter serial dilution after administration. In an actual eye, 7\u00a0min after application, the concentration drops by more than half as a result of tear turnover, suggesting that 0.01% PHMB and 0.05% propamidine isethionate should be able to effectively treat AK [15].\nOur results revealed that corneal toxicity increases with higher concentrations of PHMB and propamidine isethionate. PHMB concentrations higher than 0.02% and propamidine isethionate concentrations higher than 0.1% had significant corneal toxicity. Previous report also revealed that 0.02% PHMB resulted in significantly decreased viability for human corneal epithelial and endothelial cells [16]. In our study, 0.01% PHMB also caused decreased viability; however, in the absence of normal physiological eye function, this in vitro test could overestimate PHMB toxicity. In animal models, cornea exposure to sustained high concentrations of medications are not common. Moreover, we only give single dose of intrastromal injection in this study, the cytotoxicity is not as high as that in vitro.\n\nAlthough the results suggest that intrastromal injection of 0.01% PHMB and 0.05% propamidine isethionate are safe adjuvant therapies for deep AK, this study has some limitations. First, some Acanthamoeba strains are highly resistant to PHMB, and therefore may not respond to treatment [15]. However, since the evaluation of the toxicity of corneal intrastromal injections has been established, other antiamoebic agents can be tested for these resistant strains [17]. Second, an animal model of AK infection is required to evaluate the true effects and pharmacokinetic parameters of corneal intrastromal injection. Future studies in this model system could help determine the appropriate concentrations for intrastromal injection depending on infectious status.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate safe concentrations of PHMB and propamidine isethionate for corneal intrastromal injection in rabbit eyes. In vivo and in vitro studies suggest that intrastromal injection of 0.1\u00a0mL of 0.01% PHMB or 0.05% propamidine isethionate is safe for the corneas. These parameters should be tested in an animal model of AK to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. Moreover, propamidine isethionate has a relatively low toxicity and could be considered for intrastromal injection in deep recalcitrant AK before further evidence is found.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nAll Institutional and National Guidelines for the care and use of animals (fisheries) were followed.\n\n","56":"\n\nIntroduction\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) is a contagious liver disease affecting nearly 160 million people worldwide [1] In 2010, it was estimated that 0.5 million people die from HCV-associated hepatic diseases each year [2]. Nowadays and despite of the discovery of novel anti-HCV strategies, HCV associated death cases per year has doubled with more than 300 million people infected chronically with either hepatitis C or B [3]. Blood transfusion, hemodialysis, multiple drug injections and the use of unsterilized equipment are the main causes for increased prevalence of HCV especially in developing countries [4]. The global geographic distribution for HCV genotypes varies substantially in different parts of the world [5]. Egypt has high prevalence of HCV where approximately 3.5 million Egyptians have active HCV infection [6]. Genotype 4 is the most frequent form in HCV infected Egyptian patients [6]. HCV is a slowly progressing disease with persistent hepatic inflammation which could develop, in 20\u201330\u00a0years of HCV infection, into fibrotic wound scars, cirrhosis and\/or ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The latter is the fifth most frequent cancer type globally and is ranked third in malignancy-related mortality cases [7]. It also represents 13% of common cancer types in Egypt with nearly 7000 death cases per year [8,9]. Various epidemiological studies showed that many HCC patients (as high as 70%) have anti-HCV antibody in the serum [10]. Currently available HCC diagnostic markers such as des-\u03b3 carboxy prothrombin, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), imaging and liver biopsy are either unreliable, insensitive, expensive or invasive [11,12]. Lack of cost effective, reproducible and non-invasive biomarkers for all HCV associated hepatic diseases is a major cause for late diagnosis and hence delayed intervention and\/or therapy. Therefore there is an urgent need to search for alternative and reliable options that could assist in early diagnosis, prognosis and\/or staging, with minimal invasion to suit late disease stages, prior to offering any therapeutic option.\nMicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs which regulate expression of genes in a sequence specific approach. They pair with mRNA targets at 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) resulting in translational repression, mRNA de-adenylation and\/or decay [13]. It is reported that miRNA control most of coding genes [14]. miRNA expression was found to be partly tissue specific [15]. For instance, miR-122 is mainly expressed in liver [16]. In HCV infection, HCV RNA sequesters hepatic miR-122 for its own replication which in turn depresses normal miR-122 targets [15]. Miravirsen, a locked nucleic acid, is an antagomir against miR-122 decreasing HCV replication and was therefore used successfully as the first miRNA dependent drug [17]. Circulatory miRNAs, in particular, have emerged as potential noninvasive biomarkers in various HCV mediated liver diseases. Elevated levels of miR-155 and miR-122 and decreased levels of miR-16 and miR-199a were correlated with pathogenesis of HCV mediated HCC and were considered to be reliable non-invasive HCC biomarkers [18]. However, limited studies are available for correlation of miRNA expression profiles with hepatic disease progression from HCV infection to fibrosis and cirrhosis. This study aimed at investigating expression profiles for circulatory miR484, miR-524-5p, miR-628-3p and miR-615-5p in the plasma of HCV mediated fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC Egyptian patients as potential and non-invasive biomarkers for staging and early diagnosis purposes especially for fibrotic and cirrhotic cases.\n\n\nRationale of miRNAs selection:\nBimpaki et al. (2010) was the first to identify miR-484 as one of the upregulated miR in massive macronodular adrenocortical disease [19]. Vecchione et al. (2013) reported its down regulation in chemoresistant breast cancer [20]. Yang et al. (2016) found that miR-484 induced hepatocellular malignancy transformation in animal model and also cell lines [21]. Recently and on the contrary, Tessitore et al. (2016) reported that miR-484 was dysregulated in HCC liver tissues. This controversy could be attributed to use of different sample sources as miRNAs are partly tissue specific [22].\nBioinformatic analysis of in glioma cells revealed association of miR-524-5p with Hes-1 and Jagged-1 components of notch pathway. Using in vitro assay, miR-524-5p overexpression was reported to induce apoptosis and suppress cancer invasion and proliferation in glioma. It was therefore considered as a cancer suppressor by targeting different components in notch pathway [23]. It was also reported that its overexpression suppresses tumor proliferation through inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase)MAPK(pathway [24].\nExpression of miR-615-5p was reported to be upregulated in HCC and cirrhotic hepatic samples. Its expression was inversely correlated with Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-II) mRNA expression through direct binding to the 3\u2032-UTR region of IGF-II [25]. Its expression was elevated also in both HCC tissues and cell lines with negative regulation of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) and its downstream targets [26]. Woo et al. (2016) reported SHMT2 upregulation in HCC cell lines that were knocked down for miR-615 and noticed reduction in tumorgenicity and cell proliferation [27]. On the other hand, Chen et al. (2017) reported downregulated for miR-615-5p in HCC tissues with increase of Ras-protein which enhanced HCC metastasis in-vivo and in-vitro models [28].\nThe miR-628-3p was first reported in enteroviral infection and was considered to moderately distinguish between infected and healthy individuals [29]. Later on, its expression patterns were found to be downregulated and upregulated in colorectal and pancreatic cancers respectively [30]. Yet, its association with cancer formation and progression in general and liver in particular is not illustrated.\nThe expression profiles for the four mentioned miRNAs were not previously investigated in the plasma of HCV mediated fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC cases across the globe and among Egyptians in particular.\n\n\nPatients and methods\n\nPatients\nFollowing implementation of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, one hundred and twenty eight chronic HCV Egyptian patients were recruited in this study. All participants of this study signed a written informed consent and the ethics review committee at the Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University approved the study protocol (Serial: BC1603). This study was carried out according to Helsinki ethical guidelines. The design of the study is observational cross-sectional. Patients with the following inclusion criteria were recruited in this study; age elder than 18\u00a0years old; positive evidence for HCV infection confirmed by both anti-HCV test (HCV Ab Plus Rapid Test, Cairo, Spectrum) and positive HCV viral titer as detected by Q-RTPCR (Step-One Plus, Applied Biosystems, California, USA). Patients were negative for both hepatitis B core Ab (HBc-Ab) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Exclusion criteria were applied for any patient younger than 18\u00a0years old, or any patient with positive HBsAg and\/or HBc-Ab or any other co-infection with HBV, or any patient with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis originating from any other disorder other than HCV infection, or any patient with secondary liver cancer or any other malignancy other than HCC, or any HCV patients who received any antiviral therapy, or any treated HCC patient. Fibrotic and cirrhotic patients were categorized based on their FibroScan scores which were represented in kilo pascal. HCC diagnosis was confirmed by multiphasic MRI and\/or dynamic computed tomography. Patients were admitted, over the past three years, to the Endemic Medicine Department, Kasr El-Aini Hospital at the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Based on the rigorous criteria set for inclusion and exclusion in this study, the 128 filtered patients were classified into 47 cases with liver fibrosis (F0 to F3) subcategorized as 26 mild fibrosis (F0-F1) and 21 advanced fibrosis (F2-F3), 40 cases with liver cirrhosis (F4) and 41 HCC cases. Forty healthy volunteers with negative anti-HCV test were recruited in this study as control group. All cases included in this study were subjected to clinical, serological and biochemical investigations.\n\n\nSamples collection\nBlood samples were collected and both serum and plasma were prepared for each sample. For plasma preparation, EDTA treated blood samples were firstly centrifuged at low speed at 4000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min then the supernatant was centrifuged at high speed at 13,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, to get rid of any cellular debris, and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until use.\n\n\nRoutine laboratory tests\nRoutine lab tests included complete blood count (CBC), RBCs count, total leukocyte count, platelet count, using cytometer after dilution with appropriate solution for each assay (Egyptian Diagnostic Media, Egypt) hemoglobin (Hb) (Spectrum, Egypt), calculated MCV, prothrombin time (Biomed, Cairo, Egypt), international normalized ratio (INR), AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, albumin, alpha feto protein (AFP) using Spectrum\u00ae kit (Cairo, Egypt). All control samples were negative for HCV-antibody test.\n\n\nRNA extraction, polyadenylation and cDNA synthesis\nDirect-zol\u2122 RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research, California, USA) was used to extract total RNA according to manufacturer\u2019s manual. During extraction, cel-miR-39-3p (Qiagen, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) was used as spike-in control for normalization purposes. The A260\/A280 ratio was measured for extracted RNA to determine quality and quantity using the Q5000 UV\u2013Vis Nanodrop (Quawell, California, USA). A total of 100\u00a0ng RNA was poly adenylated with E. coli Poly(A) Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) and then reverse transcribed to synthesize cDNA using GoScript Reverse Transcription kit (Promega, California, USA) as per manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\n\nQuantitative reverse transcription-PCR\nIn each 20\u00a0\u03bcl PCR reaction of the 96 well plate, 2\u00a0\u03bcl of each diluted cDNA was mixed with 10\u00a0\u03bcl GoTaq\u00ae qPCR Master Mix (Promega, California, USA) and 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM of each primer. Primers have been carefully designed and validated for non-specific amplification to ensure precise quantitation for selected miRNAs. The plate was then amplified for 40 cycles and relative miRNA expression and fold change was calculated using 2-\u0394\u0394Ct formula with the healthy individuals group as normalizer and the spiked miR-39 as internal control as follows; \u0394\u0394Ct\u00a0=\u00a0[Ct (miR of concern, test)-Ct (miR-39, test)]-[Ct (miR of concern, calibrator)-Ct (miR-39, calibrator)].\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nData was analyzed using SPSS software v-15 (SPSS, USA) and GraphPad Prism software V5 (GraphPad, California, USA). Data are represented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM. Analysis of variance (one way ANOVA), Tukey. Chi square and post hoc tests were utilized for comparison with P value \u22640.05 considered to be significant. Since miRNA fold change values were not normally distributed as computed by Shapiro-Wilk test, we performed Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis as non-parametric tests and data was presented using median and quantiles. Analysis of correlation was carried out to investigate correlation between selected miRNAs in each category using Spearman correlation. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for evaluation of accuracy.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nClinical and demographic features of all participating groups in this study:\nThe clinical features for all studied individuals are shown in Table 1\n. In our analysis, chronic liver disease (CLD) group contained F0, F1, F2 and F3 patients. There was a significant trend (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) for progression of hepatic disease from fibrosis to cirrhosis and eventually to HCC with increasing age (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). No statistical difference for gender type among participating groups (P\u00a0=\u00a00.843) was observed. Serum biochemical parameters of ALT, ALP, AST, total bilirubin were significantly different among the studied groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with increasing values towards disease progression till HCC. Albumin and prothrombin time tests showed significant decline in liver synthetic function with liver disease progression. Albumin was significantly lower in cirrhotic and HCC cases. Although INR values increased with disease progression, this increase was significant only (<0.0001) between HCC and the remaining groups. AFP showed significant difference between mild fibrosis and HCC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012) but not between the other CLD groups. Hemoglobin, RBCs and platelet levels decreased significantly in all the studied groups as compared to the healthy controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Major reductions in those levels were noticed in cirrhosis and HCC cases. On the other hand, total leukocyte count increased significantly in all patients. All healthy subjects had negative HCV viral titer while all the remaining groups had positive viral titer with slight non significant variation among them (P\u00a0=\u00a00.457). In principle, variation in HCV viral load could be attributed to several factors. One of those factors is the HCV infection period, since viral load increases with time as concluded by Fanning et al. (2000) who noticed 1.7-fold increase in viral load per year in their studied patients [30]. Other factors that can cause variation in the baseline viral load are patients\u2019 age, BMI and their fibrotic stages as indicated by Ticehurst et al. (2007) who noticed significant correlation between baseline viral load and fibrotic stage, BMI and age among their studied patients [31]. Also, one of the factors that can influence the baseline viral load is gene polymorphism. Nguyen et al. (2018) reported significant association between interferon lambda gene polymorphisms and variation in HCV viral loads [32]. HCC patients recruited in this study had tumour size of <3\u00a0cm (20%), 3\u20135\u00a0cm (20%) and >5\u00a0cm (60%) as indicated by CT imaging. Forty eight percent of HCC patients had single liver focal lesion while the remaining had multiple hepatic foci. Occurrence of those lesions in the right lobe was recorded in 40% of HCC patients, 30% in the left lobe and 30% of cases had lesions in both lobes. Fifty eight of HCC patients developed portal vein thrombosis (PVT). The demographic and clinical data presented in Table 1 indicate that individuals recruited in each group are properly categorized and to perfectly represent the assigned group.\n\n\nDifferential expression of plasma miRNAs levels in all studied groups\nThe Kruskal Wallis test for multiple comparison of non-parametric data (GraphPad Software, CA) was used to examine if there is any statistical difference in the expression pattern of all the investigated miRNAs among healthy control, mild fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC. Plasma expression profiles for miR-615-5p and miR-524-5p in particular exhibited significant upregulation of 2.99 and 6.17 respectively between control group and patients with cirrhosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and 0.007 respectively) (Fig. 1\n). There was also significant increase (2.69, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) in miR-524-5p expression pattern in HCC group as compared to healthy individuals. There was marginal significance among the studied groups for miR-628-3p (P\u00a0=\u00a00.067). No significant differential expression was observed for miR-484 among all the studied groups (P\u00a0=\u00a00.200).\n\n\nPlasma miRNAs signatures across various stages of HCV mediated hepatic diseases\nFurthermore, plasma miRNA expression profiles and signatures through progression from mild fibrosis (F1-F2) to advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) and eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma were investigated using Mann-Whitney U test. There was a significant reduction in miR-484 expression as F1-F2 patients progress to F3-F4 (from 6.23 to 0.27) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.041) (Fig. 2\n). Furthermore, HCC patients showed significant upregulation in miR-484 when compared to patients of F3-F4 category (from 0.27 to 1.25) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.037) as shown in (Fig. 2). The upregulation in HCC cases exceeded even that in F1-F2 cases. Other comparisons of F1-F2 versus F3-F4, showed non-significant upregulation for miR-524, miR-615-5p and miR-628-3p with P-values of 0.078, 0.780 and 0.608 respectively. As for comparison of F3-F4 versus HCC, no statistical significance was found for downregulation of miR-524-5p, miR-615-5p and miR-628-3p (P\u00a0=\u00a00.798, 0.083 and 0.519 respectively).\nMoreover, individual plasma miRNA expression pattern in each stage of the fibrotic cases (from F1 to F4) was investigated using Kruskal-Wallis test (GraphPad Software, CA). There was no significant difference among those cases (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In further analysis, we also traced the profile signatures for the studied miRNAs in the combined fibrotic group (three stages from F1 to F3) against those of cirrhosis (F4 stage) and HCC cases through a dual comparison using Mann-Whitney U test (Fig. 3\n). miR-524-5p was fund to be significantly upregulated in F4 versus F1-F3 (2.99 and 0.91 respectively) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.023). Furthermore, miR-484 was upregulated in HCC versus F4 (1.25 and 0.27 respectively) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). The expression patterns for miR-615-5p and miR-628-3p did not exhibit significant difference (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) neither for HCC versus F4 nor for F1-F3 versus F4.\n\n\nPlasma miRNAs expression levels in hepatocellular carcinoma patients\nNone of the investigated miRNAs exhibited significant difference in expression profiles between HCC and CLD groups as confirmed by Mann-Whitney U test (Fig. 4\n). There was significant down-regulation for miR-615 expression in HCC group as compared to the CLD group (1.74 versus 6.17 median fold change respectively). Although the HCC group showed upregulation in their expression profiles of in miR-484, miR-524-5p and miR-628 as compared to the CLD group, but those upregulations were not significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.11, 0.39 and 0.45 respectively).\n\n\nDiagnostic performance of plasma miRNA\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to examine the diagnostic performance of at all miRNA that showed significant differential expression (Fig. 5\n). ROC analysis for plasma miR-484 showed AUC value of 0.67 (95% CI 0.5067\u20130.8307, P\u00a0=\u00a00.040) between F3-F4 and F1-F2 categories which showed differential gene expression. The discriminating power for miR-524-5p to differentiate between F1-F3 versus F4 was investigated. ROC analysis showed an AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.66 (95% CI 0.5254\u20130.8050, P\u00a0=\u00a00.022). Furthermore, ROC curve analysis revealed also ability of the miR-484 to discriminate between HCC and F3-F4 with AUC value of 0.67 (95% CI 0.5067\u20130.8307, P\u00a0=\u00a00.040).\n\n\nLogistic regression analysis of all the studies miRNAs\nUnivariate logistic regression (LR) for all the investigated miRNAs was carried out to predict miRNAs associated with hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular diagnosis but with no significant values obtained. Furthermore, LR analysis for predictor miRNAs in cirrhotic cases revealed marginal significance for miR-484 only with a P-value of 0.083. On the other hand, LR analysis for chronic and fibrotic HCV patients exhibited non significant pattern with P-values of 0.059, 0.096, 0.682 and 0.857 for miR-484, miR-628, miR-615 and miR-524 respectively.\n\n\nSpearman correlations for all investigated plasma miRNAs\nThe investigated miRNAs exhibited positive and significant correlation among the fibrotic groups. miR-524-5p was correlated with miR-628-3p (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.342, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012). There was no correlation between studied miRNA in either HCC or cirrhotic group with the highest correlation observed between miR-615-5p and miR-484 (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.229, P\u00a0=\u00a00.140) and between miR-615-5p and miR-628-3p (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.185, P\u00a0=\u00a00.203). Correlation study between HCV viral load and the investigated miRNAs revealed non significant association (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) with correlation coefficient of 0.165, 0.182, 0.289 and 0.302 for miR-484, miR-524, miR-615 and miR-628 respectively.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nPrognosis and early diagnosis of fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC disorders which are associated with prolonged HCV infection necessitates the urgent need to screen for reliable markers that can accurately detect those disorders and preferably their progression prior to offering proper medical intervention. Currently there is no non-invasive and reliable biomarker which could be utilized for diagnosis, prognosis or staging of fibrotic and cirrhotic complications arising from HCV infection.\nIn this study, the investigated miRNAs were differentially expressed among all participating groups. Plasma miR-484 levels showed upregulation in mild fibrosis (F1-F2) when compared to advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) and also upregulation in HCC group when compared to advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). Plasma expression for miR-484 could discriminate between advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) and HCC cases. Furthermore, miR-484 showed significant increase in HCC versus cirrhosis (F4). The upregulation of miR-484 expression in HCC group comes in agreement with Yang et al. (2016) findings [21]. They performed an experiment using animal model and cell lines to examine the contribution of miR-484 to hepatocellular nodules formation but not with cirrhosis or fibrosis. miR-484 was found to induce hepatocellular malignant transformation. Our findings contradict those reported by Tessitore et al. (2016) who reported that miR-484 was dysregulated in HCC disease [22].\nLevels of miR-524-5p were significantly upregulated in cirrhosis group versus healthy controls. It also showed upregulation in HCC as compared to cirrhosis with differential expression as compared to control. To the best of our knowledge, miR-524-5p expression was not reported previously neither in HCC nor in fibrosis nor in cirrhosis. In our study, miR-524-5p was downregulated in combined fibrosis (F1-F3) versus cirrhosis patients. Most of the other work published, showed downregulation of miR-524 in other cancer types such as glioma [23], but none evaluated its expression in HCC disease.\nIn this study, plasma miR-615-5p was upregulated in cirrhosis group when compared to control. Another study conducted by El Tayebi et al. (2012) reported that miR-615-5p was overexpressed in cirrhotic liver tissues as compared to healthy liver tissue [25]. It was proven that miR-615-5p suppresses IGF-2 which in turn reduce invasion and proliferation of HCC [25]. Therefore it was believed that miR-615-5p acts as tumor suppressor targeting IGF-2 win various tumor types [25]. In this study and for the first time to be reported, there was upregulation in mild fibrosis (F1-F2) group versus control group. It was also upregulated in F3-F4 when compared to healthy controls. Moreover significant down-regulation for miR-615 expression in HCC group as compared to the CLD group was also reported for the first time.\nConcerning miR-628-3p, there was marginal significance for differential expression among the Egyptian studied groups of HCC, cirrhosis and fibrosis as compared to the healthy individuals (P\u00a0=\u00a00.067). It was also positively correlated with miR-524-5p was correlated (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.342, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012). Expression profile for miR-628-3p was reported to be upregulated and downregulated in pancreatic and colorectal cancers respectively [33].\nTargetScan and miRDB programs were also used in this study to predict miRNA targets genes. The two programs revealed that miR-484 targets various key cell regulators such as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type E (PTPRE), transforming growth factor beta receptor 3 (TGFBR3), CREB regulated transcription coactivator 3 (CREB3L3) and membrane associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 1 (MAGI1). PTPRE is a member of tyrosine phosphatases which regulates cellular growth and oncogenic transformation. CREB is cAMP dependent transcription factor which play a key role in hepatocellular carcinoma. TGFBR3 is a membrane proteoglycan which inhibits TGFB signalling and its downregulation is associated with cancer development. MAGI1participates in cell\u2013cell contact through assembly of several protein complexes on the plasma membrane. Concerning miR-524, it was found to bind mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and 4 (MAPK1 and MAPK4), growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (GRB10) and BCL6 corepressor like 1 (BCORL1). MAPK family is also named as extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) which regulates various transcription factors and cellular proliferation. GRB10 suppresses cell growth through inhibition of tyrosine kinase signalling pathway. BCORL1 represses transcription through interaction with various classes of histone deacetylases. Targetscan and miRDB programs also identified ABI family member 3 (ABI3), Adenomatosis polyposis coli 2 (APC2), IGF-2 and ETS proto-oncogene 1, transcription factor (ETS1) as main target genes for miR-615. ABI3 inhibits cell migration and metastasis. APC2 reduces beta-catenin levels which plays a key role in cancer pathogenesis. ETS1 is a transcription factor which reulates various biological processes which control cell development and tumorigenesis. Amon the key target genes of miR-628 was BCL2 interacting protein 3 like (BNIP3L), EFR3 homolog 3 (EFR3A) and Serine\/Threonine Kinase 40 (STK40). BNIP3L is a member of the pro-apoptotic subfamily. EFR3A controls activity of G protein coupled receptors. While STK40 regulates various signalling pathways associated with versatile activities of the cell such as survival, proliferation and apoptosis.\nIn this study, significant positive correlation was reported between the studied miRNAs among the fibrotic groups using RT-PCR. The four investigated miRNAs of this study could discriminate different stages of HCV associated diseases from healthy individuals and could therefore have promising diagnostic value. Moreover, ROC analysis revealed that those miRNAs could be used to distinguish advanced fibrosis from mild cases. This in turn suggests the possibility of utilizing those miRNAs as promising and sensitive biomarkers in HCV mediated liver disease progression. Conducting this experiment on larger population size and also on other populations from other ethnicities with different viral genotype infection would be beneficial prior to selecting those miRNAs as universal markers in HCV mediated liver disease progression. Screening further other miRNAs using more sophisticated and highthroughput techniques such as microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) would definitely enrich the biomarker library and would facilitate the process for optimal selection of ideal miRNA panels for early diagnosis, staging and prognosis at universal level.\n\n\nConclusion\nFor the first time, our study profiled expression signature of miR-484, miR-524, miR-615 and miR-628 in HCV Egyptian patients at various disease stages. The investigated miRNAs were expressed differently in the plasma of HCC cases and could discriminate severe fibrotic cases from mild fibrosis and cirrhosis. Plasma miR-484 showed a unique expression profile with upregulation in mild fibrotic cases followed by downregulation as cases develop advanced fibrosis and is then upregulated in HCC cases. Expression level for miR-524-5p was upregulated in both cirrhosis and HCC cases following downregulation in F1-F3 combined fibrosis. Plasma miR-615-5p was upregulated in cirrhosis group when compared to control. Therefore those studied miRNAs can be beneficial in staging and diagnosis of various fibrotic, cirrhotic and HCC complications arising from HCV infection. The newly studied miRNAs could be utilized in further clinical evaluation in other populations of different genotypes.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008 (5).

Most metals have already been introduced at the centre of phthalocyanine macrocycles by slightly changing the synthetic procedure. Depending on the central metal, reactivity, electronic and magnetic properties, as well as biological functionality of the resultant complexe may change significantly [1,2]. From their discovery in 1928, metal phthalocyanines have been widely used as commercial dyes and pigments, and more recently as electrocatalysts for fuel cells [3], as models for coal char combustion and pyrolysis [4], as precursors for producing carbon nanotubes [5,6], as photosensitisers for photodynamic therapy [7], as electrode materials for energy storage [8,9], or as components in solar photovoltaic cells [10].\nLately, the use of phthalocyanines to store energy in supercapacitors has attracted increasing attention due to their pseudocapacitive behaviour. Metal phthalocyanines have been primarily used as additives to increase the capacitance of carbon materials, such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Nanocomposite films based on Ni(II) tetra-aminophthalocyanine (NiTAPc) and MWCNTs were found to yield high specific capacitances in 1\u202fmol L\u22121 H2SO4 electrolyte thanks to the nitrogen-containing groups on the phthalocyanine ring [8]. Electro-polymeric nickel tetra-aminophthalocyanine (polyNiTAPc) was also supported on MWCNTs and the resultant composite, MWCNT-polyNiTAPc, exhibited excellent stability up to 1000 cycles of charge-discharge [9]. Nevertheless, little work exists on the use of phthalocyanines as precursors of carbon materials and the application of the latter as capacitor electrodes. Metal phthalocyanines based on either Ni, Fe, Co or Mn were used to prepare CMK-3 \u2013 type ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) exhibiting high graphitic character by a hard-templating method [11]. One of these materials exhibited considerably higher electrochemical performances in 0.5\u202fmol L\u22121 H2SO4 than an amorphous CMK-3 material obtained from sucrose with the same silica template, and also presented higher resistance to oxidation owing to its highly graphitic character. However, preparing the silica template is expensive and its removal by dissolution with either HF or NaOH is necessary for recovering the carbon. The latter procedure further increases the cost of the synthesis, generates toxic products, and is therefore not easily scalable at the industrial level.\nHydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) is an environment\u2013friendly technique usually carried out inside autoclaves at mild temperatures (<250\u202f\u00b0C) under self-generated pressure, and using water or other poorly hazardous solvents [12]. Given that the reaction is exothermic, the consumption of thermal energy is very low compared to other methods. HTC is a particularly useful method to convert complex structures that do not suffer any structural disruption below 180\u202f\u00b0C, such as cellulose, lignin or lignocellulosic biomasses, and subsequent pyrolysis of the obtained hydrochars gives rise to carbon materials that have been extensively investigated as supercapacitor electrodes [12\u201314]. Other uses included the production of chemicals like phenolic compounds and aldehydes, which can be subsequently processed by bio\u2013refineries [15,16], and the obtention of metal\/carbon catalysts from mixtures of carbohydrates and metal salts followed by pyrolysis, which are suitable for a broad range of applications [17\u201319].\nGiven the high chemical stability of metal phthalocyanines, HTC would be an excellent \u201cgreen\u201d method to increase their reactivity in mild conditions of pressure and temperature, simply using water as solvent. Moreover, the central metal of the phthalocyanine can be selected for catalysing the graphitisation of the resultant carbon material at temperatures lower than those generally required for that purpose, which are typically higher than 2000\u202f\u00b0C [20\u201322]. Catalytic graphitisation using metals such as Fe or Ni therefore saves energy, decreases the synthesis cost, is easy to proceed, and can be applied to carbons considered as non-graphitisable in usual conditions of thermal treatment [23]. Using Fe(II) or Ni(II) phthalocyanines (Fig. 1\n) as simultaneous carbon precursor and graphitisation catalyst should also ensure an excellent mixing, at the atomic scale, of carbon source and metal catalyst, which strongly influences the extent of the graphitisation process [24].\nThe aim of the present work was to evaluate the synthesis of N-doped graphitic carbons from Fe(II) and Ni(II) phthalocyanines and investigate their electrochemical properties in terms of energy storage in capacitors. The carbon materials were obtained either by direct pyrolysis of metal phthalocyanines at 800 or 900\u202f\u00b0C, or by submitting them first to HTC in water, followed by pyrolysis at 900\u202f\u00b0C. The resultant carbons contained nitrogen and oxygen, and exhibited mesoporous textures whereas neither additional doping post-treatment or mesoporous templates were used, and also exhibited high graphitisation degrees, despite their low temperatures of pyrolysis. This work opens a new way to transform a broad range of metal phthalocyanines, their derivatives, as well as other organometallic complexes into graphitic carbon materials.\n\n\nExperimental section\n\nMaterials preparation\nNickel(II) phthalocyanine (90% purity), iron(II) phthalocyanine (85% purity), hydrochloric acid (37% v\/v), carbon black powder (<100\u202fnm) and sulphuric acid (98% v\/v) were purchased from Sigma\u202f\u2212\u202fAldrich. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and glass fibre separator were provided by Aldrich and Pall Life Sciences, respectively. All the materials were used as received.\nThe carbon materials were synthesised from Ni(II) or Fe (II) phthalocyanines through two different procedures:\n\n(i)\nHydrothermal carbonisation (HTC)\u202f+\u202fpyrolysis: Ni(II) or Fe(II) phthalocyanines (2\u202fg) were added to a certain volume of water (16\u202fmL), and the resultant mixture was placed in an autoclave and thermally treated under autogenous pressure (180\u202f\u00b0C, 24\u202fh). The solid was recovered by filtration, dried (105\u202f\u00b0C, 12\u202fh) and pyrolysed under nitrogen flow (900\u202f\u00b0C, 1\u202fh, 80\u202fmL\u202fN2 min\u22121, 2 \u00b0C min\u22121).\n\n\n(ii)\nDirect pyrolysis: Ni(II) or Fe(II) phthalocyanines (1\u202fg) were directly pyrolysed under nitrogen flow (800 or 900\u202f\u00b0C, 1\u202fh, 80\u202fmL\u202fN2 min\u22121, 2\u202f\u00b0C\u202fmin\u22121).\n\n\n\nThe obtained carbons were subsequently treated with a 1\u202fmol L\u22121 HCl solution to remove the surface metals, then thoroughly washed with distilled water until neutral pH, and finally dried in a ventilated oven (105\u202f\u00b0C, 12\u202fh). The final materials were called PMeST, where Me is the metal (Ni or Fe); S the synthesis method (H for materials obtained through HTC, or D for those directly pyrolysed), and T is the final temperature of pyrolysis (800 or 900\u202f\u00b0C).\n\n\nMaterials characterisation\nNitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained at \u2212196\u202f\u00b0C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 automatic system. Carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms were measured at 0\u202f\u00b0C with a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 device. The surface areas were calculated by applying two models to the nitrogen adsorption isotherms: (i) the BET method, leading to A\nBET (m2\u202fg\u22121), and (ii) the Quenched Solid Density Functional Theory (QSDFT) [25], leading to S\nQSDFT (m2\u202fg\u22121). The total pore volume, V\nQSDFT (cm3\u202fg\u22121), were calculated from the pore size distributions obtained through the QSDFT model. The micropore volumes were calculated by applying the Dubinin\u202f\u2212\u202fRadushkevich (DR) equation to the nitrogen isotherms, leading to V\n\u03bc-N2 (cm3\u202fg\u22121), and to the carbon dioxide isotherms, leading to V\n\u03bc-CO2 (cm3\u202fg\u22121). The mesopore volumes were calculated as the difference VQSDFT - (V<0.7\u202f+\u202fV0.7-2).\nThermogravimetric analysis (TG) of the HTC-treated phthalocyanines was carried out with a Netzsch STA 449F3 Jupiter microbalance by heating ~20\u202fmg of sample under a flow of either argon or synthetic air (40\u202fmL\u202fmin\u22121) up to the final temperature (900\u202f\u00b0C, 2\u202f\u00b0C\u202fmin\u22121).\nXRD patterns were collected by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer working in Bragg-Brentano configuration and equipped with an X-ray source with a Cu anode working at 40\u202fkV and 40\u202fmA and an energy-dispersive one-dimensional detector. The diffraction patterns were obtained over the 2\u03b8 range of 10\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 with a step of 0.019\u00b0. The assignation of crystalline phases was performed based on Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards. DIFFRAC.EVA software supports a reference pattern database derived from Crystallography Open Database (COD) and the Powder Diffraction File (PDF) for phase identification.\nRaman spectroscopy was carried out using a Horiba XploRa Raman spectrometer without sample preparation. The spectra were collected under a microscope using a long-distance 50\u202f\u00d7\u202fobjective. The Raman-scattered light was dispersed by a holographic grating with 1200 lines\/mm and detected by a CCD camera. The laser used a wavelength of 532\u202fnm, corresponding to an incident energy of 2.33\u202feV. The laser was filtered at 1.0% of its nominal power, thus corresponding to 0.14 mW applied to the sample. This value is a compromise between a too high power leading to some visible changes of spectra with time, suggesting heating and damage of the sample under the laser beam, and a too low power for which the signal \/ noise ratio would have been poor. Each spectrum was obtained by accumulation of two spectra recorded from 800 to 3700\u202fcm\u22121 over 180\u202fs. It was systematically checked that no significant difference was observed when the analysis was performed at different, visually comparable places of the same sample, suggesting the homogeneity of the materials.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a FEI XL30 SFEG electron microscope, and EDX analyses were carried out with an Oxford Instrument (80\u202fmm2) EDS SDD XMAX detector at 15\u202fkV over an average surface of ~25\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f\u03bcm. All samples were metallised with carbon to ensure the evacuation of electric charges under the beam. The secondary electron images were taken with an acceleration voltage of 3 or 5\u202fkV to account for the extreme surface of each sample, and an acceleration tension of 10\u202fkV was applied to visualise the distribution of iron and nickel using backscattered electrons.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a Jeol ARM 200F (cold FEG operating at 80\u202fkV) electron microscope.\nElemental analysis was performed with an Elementar Vario EL Cube analyser.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with an ESCAPlus OMICROM system equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyser. The spectrometer was operated at 10\u202fkV and 15\u202fmA, using a non-monochromatised MgK\u03b1 X-Ray Source (h\u03bd\u202f=\u202f1253.6\u202feV) and under vacuum (<5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129 Torr). Analyser pass energies of 50 and 20\u202feV were used for survey and detailed scans, respectively. Binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak (284.5\u202feV). A survey scan (1 sweep \/ 200\u202fms dwell) was acquired between 1100 and 0\u202feV. Current region sweeps for Ni2p, Fe2p, O1s, C1s and N1s were obtained. The CASA data processing software allowed smoothing, Shirley-type background subtraction, peak fitting and quantification. Atomic percentages of each element were calculated from intensity ratios using Scofield sensitivity factors [26].\nElectrochemical characterisation was performed with a Biologic VMP3 electrochemical workstation. For that purpose, electrodes (10\u202fmg\u202fcm\u22122, 0.5\u202fcm diameter) were prepared from a paste containing the finely pre-ground carbon material, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder and carbon black in the weight percent ratio of 85:10:5, and they were afterwards impregnated with the electrolyte (2\u202fmol L\u22121 H2SO4, 4\u202fdays) under vacuum.\nThe electrical conductivity of these electrodes was measured by using the four\u2013probe method with a Keithley 6430 sub-femto-ampere source\u2013measure unit. The carbon electrodes had a diameter of 0.6\u202fcm and their thickness, of about 0.3\u202fmm, was determined as the average value of ten measurements using a Keyence LK-G32 non-contact profilometer. Electric contacts were ensured by copper wires glued with silver paint to the opposite faces of the samples. The imposed current was chosen in the range for which Ohm\u2019s law was strictly obeyed, and the measurements were systematically corrected for thermoelectric effect.\nContact angle of the carbon electrodes with the 2\u202fmol L\u22121 H2SO4 electrolyte was measured at room temperature with a Kr\u00fcss DSA 100 Drop Shape Analyser.\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nPhysicochemical characterisation\nThe nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the materials were type-IV and exhibited H4-type hysteresis loops above relative pressure of about 0.4, characteristic of capillary condensation in mesopores (Fig. 1). H4-type hysteresis loops are generally associated with either slit-like pores, particles with internal voids of irregular shape and broad PSDs, or hollow spheres with walls composed of ordered mesoporous silica [27]. The carbons displayed broad PSDs in the micropore region, up to 2\u202fnm, and narrow PSDs in the mesopore region, between ~3 and 4\u202fnm. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 800 to 900\u202f\u00b0C produced a decrease of surface area, except for PNiH900, and the corresponding increase of the mesoporous fraction of the directly pyrolysed samples of both series (Table 1\n). This can be explained by the release of volatile matters and the resultant higher relative amount of metal in the final material. The samples PNiH900 and PFeD800 exhibited the highest BET areas, 210 and 220\u202fm2 g\u22121, respectively, and PNiH900 and PFeD900 presented the highest mesopore fractions of each series, 66.4 and 78.3%, respectively. Moreover, the presence of narrow porosity in the carbons was negligible, as the values of A\nBET and S\nQSDFT were similar to each other. The phthalocyanine\u2013derived materials presented BET areas similar to those or Fe\u2013containing carbon spheres obtained by HTC (200\u202f\u00b0C, 3\u202fh) of olive stones in the presence of iron salts (with Fe \/ C molar ratio of 0.05), and subsequently pyrolysed at 600\u2013800\u202f\u00b0C [28].\nThe materials carbonised at 800\u202f\u00b0C presented higher total yields than those carbonised at 900\u202f\u00b0C, in agreement with the loss of volatiles at higher temperatures. The total yields, \u03b7, were higher for the materials obtained from the nickel phthalocyanine than those derived from the iron phthalocyanine, and the treatment of the precursors by HTC had a different effect depending on the metal: the preliminary HTC increased the total yield of the material obtained from nickel phthalocyanine, PNiH900, with respect to the material directly pyrolysed, PNiD900, while it was lower for the equivalent materials obtained from iron phthalocyanine, PFeH900 and PFeD900, respectively. According to these results, the influence of HTC on the porosity of the materials was different, depending on the metal phthalocyanine used as precursor.\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the crystal phases of the materials, and the corresponding patterns are displayed in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information). The samples of the PNi series were very similar to each other, exhibiting elemental nickel and graphite, irrespective to the synthesis method used. It suggests that Ni(II) phthalocyanine was decomposed into NiO and carbon, and that NiO was subsequently reduced by carbon into elemental nickel at high temperature [29,30]. The PFe series samples exhibited graphite and metallic iron, but also various iron carbides and oxides, depending on the synthesis method used. Thus PFeH900, prepared by HTC\u202f+\u202fpyrolysis, exhibited Fe2O3 (maghemite) and C0.12Fe1.88 (martensite), while PFeD800 and PFeD900, prepared by direct pyrolysis, presented Fe3C (cohenite). The formation of iron oxides and iron carbides is indeed normally favoured by HTC, as evidenced by other works [28].\nThe quantification of the different crystalline phases of PNiH900 and PFeH900 was carried out through Rietveld\u2019s refinement using the TOPAS software, and the results are shown in Fig. S2 (Supporting Information section). The metal composition was 25.2% Ni and 13.9% Fe for PNiH900 and PFeH900, respectively, and the crystal size of both metals was very similar, 59 and 64\u202fnm, respectively, indicating that both materials were obtained in similar conditions. Graphite exhibited two contributions: trigonal graphite (C graphite-3R) and hexagonal graphite (C graphite-2H). Interestingly, PNiH900 exhibited a higher amount of trigonal graphite than hexagonal graphite, 43.3 and 31.5%, respectively. This is a very uncommon fact since it is well known that trigonal graphite usually appears as a minor phase in graphitic carbons and mainly in those that have being damaged by milling. The major component in PNiH900 was graphite, while the major components in PFeH900 were iron-based phases (Fig. S2). This suggests that iron exerted a higher catalytic effect towards the gasification of carbon, as confirmed by TG analysis (see below). Still, the crystal size of trigonal and hexagonal graphite in PFeH900 was higher than in PNiH900, suggesting also the higher efficiency of iron than nickel for carbon graphitisation. This was confirmed by Raman spectrometry (see below). For both PFeH900 and PNiH900, however, the crystallite size of trigonal and hexagonal graphite was very low, indicating the nearly absence of long-range order in these carbon materials.\nThe d\n002 values of the PNi series samples calculated from the peak located at around 26.2\u00b0, which is assigned to hexagonal graphite, were 0.342, 0.339 and 0.336\u202fnm for PNiD800, PNiD900 and PNiH900, respectively (Fig. S3 in Supporting Information). For the samples of the PFe series, PFeD800, PFeD900 and PFeH900, the d\n002 values were 0.340, 0.339 and 0.338\u202fnm, respectively. Therefore, the samples directly heated from 800 to 900\u202f\u00b0C were slightly more graphitic, as expected, and even more so when prepared by HTC\u202f+\u202fsubsequent pyrolysis at 900\u202f\u00b0C since the values of d\n002 values of PNiH900 and PFeH900 were the closest to that of graphite, 0.335\u202fnm.\nThe TG and DTG curves in argon or air of the samples prepared by HTC are shown in Fig. S4a and S4b, respectively. The pyrolysis of the hydrochars obtained from the Ni(II) and Fe(II) phthalocyanines in argon gave rise to 3 and 5 main weight loss steps, respectively. The progressive sublimation of \u03b1-phase into \u03b2- phase phthalocyanines might occur up to 550\u202f\u00b0C [31,32]. In the case of iron phthalocyanines, for example, a mixture of \u03b1-and \u03b2-polymorphic states normally exists up to ~400\u202f\u00b0C, the \u03b1-state progressively disappearing as the temperature increases so that only the \u03b2-state remains at ~550\u202f\u00b0C [32]. The presence of PFe hydrochar particles, PFe-HTC, exhibiting more defects and\/or lower size than those of the PNi hydrochar, PNi-HTC, can contribute to the higher weight loss of the former compound up to 450\u202f\u00b0C [32]. The highest weight loss up to 550\u202f\u00b0C is due to the transport in vapour phase of phthalocyanines and possibly to the loss of a few volatile matters, between ~200\u2013300\u202f\u00b0C, which are swept out to the cold part of the reactor. This weight loss is higher for PFe-HTC than for PNi-HTC, 29.4% and 8.1%, respectively [33,34]. The weight losses above 500\u2013550\u202f\u00b0C are mainly assigned to the release of nitrogen groups and non-aromatic hydrocarbons, due to the break-up of the phthalocyanine phenyl rings [32], and the reduction of metallic ions to elemental metals may also take place above 600\u202f\u00b0C [28]. 59.3\u202fwt% of the initial weight of PNi-HTC remained at 900\u202f\u00b0C whereas 38.8\u202fwt% remained for PFe-HTC. As indicated above, the carbonisation yields of the samples were 50.2 and 34.2%, respectively. Both values differ by 15.3 and 11.9%, respectively, mainly due to the process of vapour phase transport, which takes place in a greater extent when submitting the materials to carbonisation in the quartz reactor located inside the tubular oven flushed by inert gas than in the small crucible of the TG instrument.\nThe TG and DTG curves in air showed two weight loss steps at 400\u2013600\u202f\u00b0C for PNi-HTC and at 450\u2013680\u202f\u00b0C for PFe-HTC, which correspond to the decomposition and oxidation of the phthalocyanine structure [35]. PNi-HTC was more reactive towards the oxidising atmosphere, since the initial decomposition temperature was lower than for PFe-HTC [4]. It has been demonstrated that the central metal greatly influences the catalytic properties of the phthalocyanine complexes towards thermal oxidation reactions, and Ni seems to catalyse such decomposition in air faster than Fe [36]. The remaining weight fraction of the final products were 20.6 and 21.6\u202fwt% at 900\u202f\u00b0C for PNi-HTC and PFe-HTC, respectively, corresponding to more or less stoichiometric nickel and iron oxides [28].\nSEM pictures show that the phthalocyanine-derived materials were composed of particles with irregular size and shape that were highly agglomerated, making it difficult to determine an average particle size (Fig. S5 of Supporting Information). EDX analysis was performed in at least 12 points of each sample, see Figs. S6 and S7 of the Supplementary Information. As expected, carbon was the main element for all materials, with a range of about 91\u201396 at.%. PNiD800 and PFeD800 presented average contents of 3.30 and 1.15 at.% N, 2.03 and 2.18 at.% O, and 2.71 at.% Ni and 2.00 at.% Fe, respectively. The oxygen concentrations slightly increased for the samples directly pyrolysed at 900\u202f\u00b0C and for those prepared through HTC\u202f+\u202fpyrolysis at 900\u202f\u00b0C, 2.25\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.16 and 3.24\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.96 at.% O, respectively; however, the nitrogen concentrations considerably decreased down to 0.82\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.78 at.% and 0.97\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.80 at.% N, respectively, and so did the metal concentrations, 0.99\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.34 at.% Ni and 0.55\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13 at.% Fe, respectively. The chemical distribution of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen was quite homogeneous, while iron and nickel were mainly detected in the core of the particles (Fig. 2\n). Such a chemical distribution is consistent with the HRTEM images of the materials, which clearly display quasi-spheres of iron or nickel surrounded by a carbon shell having a graphitic structure (Fig. 3\n). The distance between the corresponding carbon layers was estimated at ~0.34\u202fnm from the inset of Fig. 3, i.e., slightly higher than that of perfect graphite, 0.335\u202fnm, as expected. In both cases, the metal-encapsulated carbon spheres coexisted with onion\u2013like structures and graphitic carbon nanoribbons (Fig. 3a and b). Similar structures have been previously obtained by annealing at 900\u202f\u00b0C dehydro[18]annulenes containing a ferrocene cycle [37].\nThe catalytic effect of iron and nickel on carbon graphitisation above 1000\u202f\u00b0C has been widely demonstrated elsewhere, but it seems to be favored even at lower temperatures, 800 and 900\u202f\u00b0C, when both metals are intimately mixed with carbon as it is obviously the case in phthalocyanines [28,38]. Undoubtedly, the highly aromatic character of the phthalocyanine structure may contribute to favour the graphitisation of the materials.\nThe Raman spectra evidenced a first-order part, ranging from 1000 to 1800\u202fcm\u22121, and a second-order part, ranging from 2200 to 3400\u202fcm\u22121 (Fig. 4\n). The first-order Raman spectra of the materials treated at the lowest temperature, 800\u202f\u00b0C, presented an intense and broad D band and a slightly less intense but narrower G band, typical of disordered carbons. The D bands were centered at 1342.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fcm\u22121 and 1346.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0\u202fcm\u22121 and the G bands were centered at 1591.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fcm\u22121 and 1587.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.0\u202fcm\u22121 for the PNi and PFe series samples, respectively. The I(D)\/I(G) ratios were calculated from the maximum intensities of the D and G bands and were plotted for the two series of samples (Fig. S8 in Supporting Information). The presence of Ni and Fe in contact with carbon is expected to produce the catalytic graphitisation of the latter, and therefore the observed decrease of the I(D)\/I(G) ratio indicates that these materials are indeed in the graphitisation regime [39]. In this condition, the I(D)\/I(G) ratio is inversely proportional to 1\/La\n, where La\n is the crystallite size along the carbon layers [40]. As expected, increasing the temperature thus logically improved the structural ordering of the carbon at the nanoscale, whether the metal was Ni or Fe. In the case of Fe, the preliminary HTC treatment (PFeH900) improved the graphitisation of the PFe series, since PFeH900 presented a lower I(D)\/I(G) ratio than PFeD900, in agreement with the lower d\n002 observed from XRD results. It is not clear yet why the hydrothermal treatment had not exactly the same effect on Ni-derived carbons, and it may be conjectured that the different Lewis acidic character of Ni(II) and Fe(II) played a role when the materials were submitted to hot pressurised water conditions.\nConsidering the 2nd-order part of the Raman spectra led to the same conclusions as above. The very broad band from ~2500 to ~3300\u202fcm\u22121 of sample PNiD800 was very poorly structured, and such feature is typical of a highly disordered carbon. This band, called S1, is known to split into two bands when the structure of carbon acquires a tri-periodic order [41], i.e., involving an order in the way the carbon layers are stacked. The appearance of two small peaks instead of a broad one in the 2nd-order part of the spectra of PNiH900 and PFeD800 suggests the better organisation of these materials with respect to PNiD800. The carbon nanotexture was even more ordered in PFe samples treated at 900\u202f\u00b0C, since the corresponding spectra presented narrow bands and very well defined second-order parts. Especially, the band near 2700\u202fcm\u22121, called 2D because it is an overtone of band D, which was more developed in PFeH900. This band is assigned to edge planes [42], so that an increase of its intensity is related to a higher degree of graphitisation and indicates the development of a graphitic nano-structure [43]. The growth of the D\u202f+\u202fD\u2019 and 2D\u2019 bands near 2930 and 3200\u202fcm\u22121, respectively, is one more proof of the formation of a defective graphitic nature of PFe samples treated at 900\u202f\u00b0C [44]. In summary, Fe-based phthalocyanines always led to more graphitic structures than Ni-based phthalocyanines carbonised at the same temperature, especially when a preliminary HTC step was carried out.\nThe bulk chemical composition of the materials was determined by elemental analysis (Table 2\n). Increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 800 to 900\u202f\u00b0C for the directly pyrolysed samples produced a slight decrease of nitrogen and oxygen concentrations and an increase of carbon and metal contents. Assuming that metals remain in the materials in this range of temperature, these findings are consistent with the loss of thermally unstable nitrogen and oxygen groups from the surface. Since oxygen is not present in phthalocyanine molecules, the oxygen found in the materials is expected to come from oxidation of carbon defects and edges with air and\/or from the impurities of the raw precursors [4]. The samples prepared through HTC\u202f+\u202fpyrolysis, PNiH900 and PFeH900, exhibited higher amounts of nitrogen and oxygen than the samples directly pyrolysed at 900\u202f\u00b0C, PNiD900 and PFeD900. This may indicate the formation of nitrogen and oxygen groups during HTC that are more thermally stable than those formed through direct pyrolysis [45]. Moreover, the amount of metal removed from PNiH900 and PFeH900 by acid etching was higher than for the other samples, likely indicating that the metal was more accessible.\nVery low concentrations of metals were detected by XPS at the surface of the materials (Table S1 in Supporting Information). The surface concentration of nickel was 0.2\u20130.3 at. % in the PNi series, and that of iron was 0.1\u20130.4 at.% in the PFe-derived samples. The respective signals for both metals were so weak that the quantification was inaccurate, and the surface concentrations might thus be even lower. In the case of iron, for example, the curve fitting was impossible for PFeD800 and PFeD900. Given that nickel concentrations up to 17.9\u202fwt% (4.0 at.%) and iron concentrations up to 20.0\u202fwt% (4.81 at.%) were measured in the material bulk, the low metal concentrations found at their surfaces clearly indicates that both metals are encapsulated inside carbon shells [46], as already seen in Fig. 4.\nFitting the Ni2p region for PNiD800 and PNiD900 was also very inaccurate due to the high nitrogen content of the samples, 3.6 and 2.1 at.%, respectively: the signal of the Auger electrons of nitrogen was indeed very strong and interfered with the signal of Ni2p1\/2, located in the same region. In the case of PNiH900, fitting the Ni2P1\/2 region was more accurate because the N concentration was lower, ~1.3 at.%, and the signal of Auger electrons of nitrogen did not interfere so strongly. Thus, only the relative intensity factors of Ni2p3\/2 were considered to fit the Ni2p high-resolution spectra of PNiD800 and PNiD900, and the relative intensity factors of Ni2p1\/2 and Ni2p3\/2 were considered to fit the Ni2p high-resolution spectra of PNiH900.\nThe fitting of the peaks revealed the presence of various contributions for the Ni2p3\/2 region (Fig. S9 in Supporting Information). The corresponding binding energies, BE (eV), and relative areas, A (%), are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The Ni2p high-resolution spectra of PNiD800 and PNi900 presented the peaks II(1), assigned to Ni0; II(2), assigned to NiO; and III(3), assigned to Ni-C complexes. No shake-up peak was obtained despite the presence of NiO, which can be due to the low surface concentration of nickel. In the case of PNiH900, the existence of the shake-up peak evidenced the presence of oxidised nickel species, NiO and Ni-C. No Ni0 was found for this sample. The Ni-C peak is assigned to a Ni-C complex but also to Ni2O3; the latter is highly unstable and may originate from the oxidation of Ni(II) by the XPS radiation [47]. Two oxidised Ni species were thus identified by XPS on the surface of the PNi series samples, but only Ni0 was identified by XRD. These observations are not contradictory, since XRD gives information about the material bulk and only detects crystallised compounds, whereas XPS investigates the material surface and its sensitivity is higher than that of XRD.\nThe Fe2p high-resolution spectrum of PFeH900 exhibited complex multiplet splitting and presented satellite features, which allowed determining the oxidation states of iron (Fig. S9 in Supporting Information). Due to the low intensity of the emission line, the Fe2p3\/2 region of the spectrum was only fitted by two peaks and the shake-up satellite, instead of the six peaks that can be normally used for Fe3+ and appearing at this BE [48]. The two peaks obtained, II(1) and II(2), indicate the presence of Fe(III), likely in the form of Fe2O3\n[49].\nThe Ni2p and Fe2p high-resolution spectra are consistent with the O1s high-resolution spectra of the samples (Fig. S10 in Supporting Information). The latter indeed presented three contributions: O(1) peak, assigned to metal-oxygen bonds in metal oxides [49,50]; O(2) peak, assigned to CO double bonds in quinone-type groups, carbonyls and carboxylic acids; and O(3) peak related to OH bonds in phenols, to COC ether groups and to CO bonds in ester and anhydride groups [51]. The assignations for the peaks of the C1s and N1s high-resolution spectra are typical of carbon materials (Figs. S11 and S12 in Supporting Information), and can be found in Table S1 (Supporting Information). In general, the most abundant nitrogen groups on the material surface were pyridinic (N6 peak), pyrrolic (N5 peak) and quaternary nitrogen (NQ peak). Samples prepared with the same procedures exhibited interesting chemical similarities: PNiD800 and PFeD800 possessed the highest amounts of N6 and N5, PNiH900 and PFeH900 the highest amounts of metal-oxygen compounds, and PNiD900 and PFeD900 the highest amounts of NQ. Although the concentration of carbonyls and quinones was not very different among the studied carbons, PNiD900, PFeD800 and PFeH900 exhibited the highest concentrations.\nFrom the above results, it was confirmer that both nickel and iron are essentially located in the core of carbon particles, in other words, are encapsulated. Nickel is mainly in the form of Ni0, but iron is found simultaneously in the form of Fe0, iron oxides and iron carbides. The low concentrations of nickel and iron that can be detected on the material surface are partially oxidised.\n\n\nElectrochemical characterisation\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed in a two-electrode cell at scan rates between 1 and 1000\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121 within the potential window of 0\u20131\u202fV and using 2\u202fmol L\u22121 H2SO4 as electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the two-electrode system (C2e, F g\u22121) was calculated from the CV curves according to Eq. (1):\n\n(1)\n\n\nC\n2\ne\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\nI\n\u0394\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\/\n\n(\ns\n\u0394\nV\nm\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere I (A) is the current, s (V s\u22121) is the scan rate, \u0394V (V) is the potential window and m (g) is the mass of carbon in the electrodes. The gravimetric capacitance for a single electrode (C3e, F g\u22121) can be estimated through Eq. (2):\n\n(2)\n\n\nC\n3\ne\n=\n4\n\u00d7\nC\n2\ne\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CV curves and the results of specific capacitance of the studied electrodes are shown in Fig. S13 (Supporting Information). The CV curves presented quasi-rectangular shape in the entire range of scan rates, with no obvious redox peaks associated to Faradaic reactions of the surface groups (Fig. S13a\u2013b). This suggests that the energy was mainly stored by an electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC) mechanism, i.e., based on ion adsorption. When the scan rate increased from 1 to 1000\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121, the CV curves of the PNi\u2013derived electrodes became somewhat distorted but still retained a rectangular shape (Fig. S13a). In the case of the PFe\u2013derived electrodes, the CV curves had a rectangular shape for PFeH900 and PFeD900, but were highly distorted for PFeD800. The rectangular shape of the curves at the highest scan rate of 1\u202fV\u202fs\u22121 indicates a fast ion transport and high rate capability of the samples, which is of great importance for practical devices. The highly distorted CV profile of PFeD800 suggests that this sample exhibits the highest ion transport resistivity and the lowest rate capability out of all present materials.\nThe values of specific capacitance at the lowest scan rate of 1\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121 seemed to be more related to the preparation method than to the type of metal phthalocyanine. PNiD800 and PNiH900 exhibited the highest capacitances of ~14\u202fF g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f56\u202fF g\u22121), followed by PFeD800 and PFeH900, ~13\u202fF g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f52\u202fF g\u22121). However, PNiD900 and PFeD900 displayed the lowest specific capacitances of their respective series, 11 and 6 F g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f44 and 24\u202fF g\u22121) (Fig. S13c\u2212d). On the contrary, the capacitance retention values at the highest scan rate of 1\u202fV\u202fs\u22121 seemed to be more related to the type of phthalocyanine. The PFe series carbons exhibited the highest capacitance retentions of 73.0 and 72.4% for PFeD900 and PFeH900, respectively, with the exception of PFeD800 that attained only 36.8% (Fig. S13f). These values were a bit smaller for the PNi-derived materials, which exhibited capacitance retentions between 56.0 and 61.7% for PNiH900 and PNiD800, respectively (Fig. S13e).\nGalvanostatic charge\u2013discharge (GCD) experiments were studied in a two-electrode cell within the potential window 0\u20131\u202fV. The GCD curves were obtained at current densities between 0.2 and 12 A g\u22121, based on the total mass of the two electrodes. From these measurements, the gravimetric capacitance, C2e (F g\u22121) was calculated by applying Eq. (3):\n\n(3)\n\n\nC\n2\ne\n=\nI\n\/\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\ndV\n\/\nd\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere I (A) represents the discharge current, dV\/dt (V s\u22121) is the slope of the discharge curve without considering the voltage drop, IR (V), due to the inner resistance at the beginning of the discharge process, and m (g) is again the mass of carbon in both electrodes.\nIn general, the GCD curves of the samples exhibited quasi-triangular profiles typical of carbon materials, thus indicating that ion storage mainly occurred through an EDLC mechanism (Fig. 5\na\u2212b). However, the GCD curve of PFeD800 slightly deviated from the triangular shape, especially the discharge curve, and this could indicate the occurrence of a pseudocapacitance contribution to the total capacitance. The GCD curves recorded at 5 A g\u22121 exhibited a sudden potential drop, or IR drop, at the beginning of the discharge process, which is attributed to the cell resistance, Rcell\n (Fig. 5\u2212b). The values of specific capacitance at the lowest current density of 0.2 A g\u22121 were also more related to the preparation method than to the type of metal phthalocyanine (Fig. 5c\u2212d). PNiD800 and PNiH900 displayed the highest capacitances of the PNi series, 15\u202fF g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f60\u202fF g\u22121) and 12\u202fF g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f48\u202fF g\u22121), respectively, and PFeD800 and PFeH900 the highest ones of the PFe series, 14\u202fF g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f56\u202fF g\u22121) and 12\u202fF g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f48\u202fF g\u22121), respectively. Moreover, PNiD900 and PFeD900 also presented the lowest specific capacitances of their respective series, 9\u202fF g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f36\u202fF g\u22121) and 6 F g\u22121 (C3e\u202f=\u202f24\u202fF g\u22121), respectively. The decrease of capacitance with increasing current densities is due to the increasing ohmic resistance of the electrolyte in the axial direction of the micropores (Fig. 5c\u2212d). This is related to the increased potential difference between the mouth and the bottom of the micropores as the current density increases, thus decreasing the ion diffusion in the micropores [52]. Among the studied materials, PFeD900 and PFeH900 yielded the highest capacitance retentions of 80.0 and 84.5%, respectively, at the highest current density of 12 A g\u22121. The PNi\u2013derived electrodes exhibited capacitance retentions between 60.5 and 77.6% for PNiD800 and PNiH900, respectively, and PFeD800 presented the lowest capacitance retention out of all materials, 36.5%. These results are in agreement with those obtained from the CV tests, discussed above.\nThe energy density, E (Wh kg\u22121), and the power density, P (W kg\u22121), were calculated from the GCD tests at current densities ranging from 0.2 to 12 A g\u22121 by applying Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively:\n\n(4)\n\n\nE\n=\n1\n\/\n2\n\nC\n2\ne\n\n\u0394\n\nV\n\nd\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nP\n=\nE\n\/\n\u0394\n\nt\nd\n\n\n\n\nwhere C2e (F g\u22121) represents the specific capacitance calculated from Eq. (3) that considers the carbon mass in the two electrodes, \u0394Vd\n (V) is the operation voltage calculated as Vmax\n \u2212 IR, where IR (V) is again the voltage drop due to the inner resistance at the beginning of the discharge process, and \u0394td\n (s) is the discharge time. The cycling stability was also studied through GCD tests at the current density of 5 A g\u22121 up to 10000 cycles of charge\u2013discharge. The specific capacitance for a given GCD cycle and the capacitance retention were determined by using Eq. (3).\nAs expected, the samples exhibiting the highest capacitances determined by GCD presented the highest energy densities, that is, PNiD800 and PNiH900, and PFeD800 and PFeH900 (Fig. 5e\u2212f). Among the studied materials, PFeH900 exhibited the highest energy and power densities in the entire range of current densities: the energy densities varied in the range of 1.7\u20131.2\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg\u22121 under the power outputs of 140.3\u20136537.5\u202fW\u202fkg\u22121, respectively. PFeD800 presented high energy density at low current, but it sharply decreased above 1 A g\u22121, as well as the power densities, and PNiD900 and PFeD900 presented the lowest energy and power density values of both series.\nIn a general way, the capacitance values obtained by CV and GCD, and then the energy densities obtained by GCD, can be explained in terms of the SQDFT\n values, since both parameters are directly related. PNiD900 is an exception, given that it should yield at least a similar capacitance to that of PFeH900, according to its surface area. The capacitance retentions can be related to the mesopore fraction, % Vmeso\n, of the materials. It is generally accepted that mesopores facilitate diffusion of electrolyte ions towards micropores, thus increasing the capacitance retention both at high scan rates and at high current regimes. In this sense, the sharp capacitance decrease of PFeD800 when both scan rates and current densities increase can be mainly attributed to its low mesopore fraction of 37.7%. However, the capacitance retention of PFeD900 should be higher than that of PFeH900, according to its higher mesopore percentage of 78.3%.\nIn order to clarify these observations, the IR drop of the materials was calculated from the GCD curves obtained at current densities between 0.2 and 12 A g\u22121. The cell resistance was determined through the slope of the straight lines obtained by plotting the IR drop as a function of discharge current (Fig. S14a\u2212b in Supporting Information). Interestingly, there is a clear relationship between Rcell\n and energy and power densities of the electrode materials: the samples displaying the highest cell resistances, PNiD900, PFeD800 and PFeD900, also presented the lowest energy and power density values, especially at high current. PNiD800 and PNiH900 exhibited similar cell resistances Rcell\n and, consequently, similar E and P densities, and PFeH900 exhibited the lowest Rcell\n and the highest E and P densities out of all materials. Rcell\n comprises the electrolyte resistance, the intrinsic resistance of the active material, and the interfacial contact resistance between the active material and the current collector [53]. As the same electrolyte was used in all cases, the observed differences should be mainly explained by differences in the intrinsic resistance of the carbon electrodes and in the interfacial contact between the active material and the current collector. It is well known that the electrical conductivity of the carbon electrodes is a key parameter to enhance the charge transfer between the electrode and the current collector, thus leading to an improvement of the energy and power density of the supercapacitor [54]. Surprisingly, PNiD900 and PFeD900 electrodes presented the highest electrical conductivities, 0.53 and 0.43 S cm\u22121, respectively, but their capacities and energy densities were the lowest of both series (Fig. S15 in Supporting Information). In principle, it is expected that electrical conductivity is affected by oxygen moieties due to their electron-withdrawing nature [55,56], but no conclusive data have been published so far. For example, on the one hand, the removal of hydroxyl and epoxide groups from the basal plane of potentially insulating GO has been related to an increased electrical conductivity [57,58]. But, on the other hand, the presence of low concentrations of oxygen groups on carbon blacks, such as in the present study, was proved to have a very limited influence on the electrical conductivity [59]. Regarding the nitrogen groups, the general consensus concludes to the enhancement of the electrical conductivity by NQ groups, since each of them gives ~0.5 electrons to the \u03c0 network of the carbon lattice, which can be considered as n-type doping. Nevertheless, it has been recently observed that the coexistence of electron-accepting N6 and N5 moieties with electron-donating NQ ones, may weaken the n-doping effect of NQ by reducing the electron mobility with respect to pristine graphene, thus in turn decreasing the electrical conductivity [60]. Consequently, the values of electrical conductivity of the studied samples may be mainly attributed to the combination of the graphitisation degree of the carbon materials and of the relative amounts of N6, N5 and NQ moieties. It may also be recalled that PNi-derived samples contained elemental metal, whereas those of the PFe series were also rich in oxides, thus decreasing their conductivity further. PNiD900 and PFeD900 yielded the highest conductivity values due to their high graphitic character, low N6 and N5 concentrations, and high NQ concentrations, while the opposite situation occurred in the case of PNiD800 and PFeD800. A denser packing of the carbon particles or a higher obstruction of the pore entrance by PTFE binder in PNiD900 and PFeD900 may hinder the ion transport through the electrodes and increase Rcell\n, despite possessing higher electrical conductivities than the other materials. This fact, together with their low surface areas and their comparatively lower concentrations of electroactive groups, such as N6 and N5, may contribute to the lower capacitances and energy densities of both samples with respect to those of their respective series.\nThe cycling stability of the samples was exceptionally high, 98\u202f\u00b1\u202f1 and 99\u202f\u00b1\u202f0% for the PNi and PFe series, respectively, at 5 A g\u22121 up to 10000 cycles of charge-discharge (Fig. S14c\u2212d). Rcell\n slightly increased with the number of cycles for all the samples (Fig. S15e), but the energy and power densities remained essentially the same throughout the 10000 cycles of charge-discharge at 5 A g\u22121 (Fig. S14f). It is noteworthy that the cycling stabilities of the materials published in this work are similar than those reported for 3D CNT\u2013supported graphene nanoarchitectures exhibiting higher BET areas of 418\u202fm2 g\u22121, which yielded capacitance retentions of ~98% after 10000 cycles of charge-discharge in 1\u202fM H2SO4\n[61]. Clew\u2013like porous carbons obtained by catalytic graphitisation of sucrose with nickel acetate and submitted to further activation attained lower capacitance retentions of 86.6\u201394.3% after 5000 cycles at a lower current density of 0.5\u202fF g\u22121 in 6\u202fM KOH, despite possesing higher surface areas up to 691\u202fm2 g\u22121\n[62]. Mesoporous carbon microspheres obtained from resorcinol\u2013formadehyde resins through catalytic graphitisation with nickel nitrate at 900\u202f\u00b0C and subsequent activation also exhibited much lower capacitance retentions of ~90% after only 500 cycles of charge-discharge at lower current densities of 1 A g\u22121 and using 6\u202fM KOH as electrolyte, whereas their BET areas were higher than 1000\u202fm2 g\u22121\n[29]. It is also remarkable that, while the synthetic processes applied to prepare these materials are complicated, use hazardous precursors or need activation to further develop their porosities, the materials synthesised in the present work were simply obtained from phthalocyanines by direct carbonisation or by HTC in water\u202f+\u202fcarbonisation without any activation step.\nInterfacial capacitance was used to estimate the participation of surface groups to the total capacitance through pseudocapacitance, the latter being proportional to the surface heteroatom concentration. The interfacial capacitances of the materials were calculated by dividing the specific capacitances obtained at different scan rates by the surface areas obtained by application of the QSDFT method, C\/SQSDFT\n\n[14]. The samples directly carbonised at 800\u202f\u00b0C, PNiD800 and PFeD800, exhibited the highest interfacial capacitances of their respective series in the entire range of scan rates, while PNiD900 and PFeD900 exhibited the lowest ones (Fig. 6\na\u2212b). This suggests that the surface chemistry of the materials contributes to the total capacitances through the occurrence of Faradaic reactions at the electrode surface, which allows storing the energy through a pseudocapacitance mechanism. The values of C\/SQSDFT\n at different scan rates were plotted versus the content of the different groups observed at the material surface, and the best correlation was found with the concentration of N\u202f+\u202fO surface groups (Fig. 6c\u2212f). Among the nitrogen groups, N6 and N5 contributed to increase the capacitance of the materials through pseudocapacitance (Fig. S16a\u2212b in Supporting Information), as well as the oxygen groups determined by O(2) and O(3) (Fig. S16c\u2212d in Supporting Information). The correlation between the interfacial capacitances and the amount of metals was not conclusive. Considering that metals were surrounded by carbon, and given the extremely low metal concentration observed at the materials\u2019 surface, it is highly probable that the contact of metal with electrolyte is negligible so that they can never contribute to the capacitance through Faradaic processes. Metal encapsulation by carbon has proved to be highly effective to prevent the degradation of the metal by the electrolyte during the cycling life of the derived supercapacitors, as evidenced by the extraordinary high capacitance retentions attained by the phthalocyanine-derived materials after 10000 cycles of charge\u2013discharge. Interfacial capacitances defined as the ratio C\/A\nBET were also calculated for comparison with previously reported data (Fig. S17 in Supporting Information). The phthalocyanine\u2013derived materials yielded higher interfacial capacitances than those attained not only by materials with similar BET areas, such as iron\u2013catalysed graphitic mesoporous carbons in 6\u202fM KOH electrolyte [24] or iron\u2013catalysed biomass\u2013derived carbons in 1\u202fM KOH electrolyte [63], but also by materials with much higher BET areas, such as activated carbon aerogels in 30% KOH electrolyte (A\nBET\u202f=\u202f1418\u202fm2 g\u22121) [64], nickel\u2013catalysed graphitic activated carbons in 1\u202fM H2SO4 electrolyte (A\nBET\u202f=\u202f1558\u20131622\u202fm2 g\u22121) [65] or nickel\u2013catalysed mesoporous carbon microspheres in 6\u202fM KOH electrolyte (A\nBET\u202f=\u202f1088\u20131096\u202fm2 g\u22121) [29]. The pseudocapacitance contribution of the surface groups through Faradaic reactions and the graphitic character of the materials contribute decisively to the comparatively higher electrochemical performances of the phthalocyanine-derived carbons.\nThe different concentrations of N and O groups of the carbons had no obvious effects on the wettability of the electrode surfaces by the electrolyte, 2\u202fmol L\u22121 H2SO4, since the contact angle was higher than 90\u00b0 in all cases (Fig. S18 in Supporting Information). This means that the interaction of the electrodes with the electrolyte was hydrophobic, which agrees with the graphitic character of the carbons and their homogeneous mixture with the binder, PTFE. Complete impregnation was therefore guaranteed by keeping the electrodes with the electrolyte during 4\u202fdays under vacuum.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nNickel and iron phthalocyanines gave rise to N,O-co-doped carbons having high mesopore fractions, narrow pore size distributions between ~3 and 4\u202fnm, and graphitic carbon structures, by simply carbonising them at 800 or 900\u202f\u00b0C, or by submitting them first to HTC in water, followed by pyrolysis at 900\u202f\u00b0C. Neither additional N-doping post-treatment or mesoporous templates were required, and low pyrolysis temperatures were enough to obtain graphitic carbon thanks to the presence of Ni or Fe, naturally present in the precursors, and which acted as graphitisation catalysts.\nThe PNi materials were composed of elemental nickel and graphite, irrespective of the synthesis method used, while the PFe materials contained graphite, metallic iron and various carbides and oxides depending on the synthesis method. Iron seemed to be more effective as catalyst because of the higher size of graphite crystallites and the main presence of iron-based phases in the materials, whereas nickel produced an extraordinarly high level of trigonal graphite, which is generally a minor phase in carbons. In both cases, graphite lacked long-range order and was mainly forming graphitic carbon nanoribbons and onion\u2013like structures.\nBoth nickel and iron were encapsulated in the core of the onion\u2013like structures, with no contact with the electrolyte and with no effect on energy storage. The studied phthalocyanine-derived carbons presented unusually high cycling stabilities, exhibiting capacitance retentions up to 99% after 10000 cycles of charge-discharge, and yielded higher electrochemical performances than a wide variety of materials with much higher surface areas, which is mainly assigned to their graphitic character and to the pseudocapacitance contribution of the surface groups.\nTherefore, this work opens a new way to transform a broad range of metal phthalocyanines, their derivatives, as well as other organometallic complexes into graphitic carbon materials.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","58":"\n\nIntroduction\nMicrowave (MW) radiation, referred to as nonionizing electromagnetic radiation, in the frequency range of 300\u00a0MHz\u2013300\u00a0GHz has been extensively used in daily life for different purposes including domestic (food), industrial (telecommunications, agriculture, military), and medical purposes [1,2]. The popularization of cell phones, wireless devices, computers, and other electrical equipment has made the learning, working, and entertainment more convenient, but led to frequent exposure to MWs. Moreover, with the development of various advanced military weapons, equipment, and radars, the soldiers are exposed to intricate environmental factors, including high-power microwave (HPM) radiations [1]. MW radiation, which induces many biological effects, was considered the fourth largest source of pollution [3,4].\nMWs can be used for medical purposes [2,5\u20137]. MW sensing and imaging have been used for tumor detection, early diagnostics, blood clot\/stroke detection, heart imaging, bone imaging, and localization of in-body radio-frequency sources [8\u201317]. MW-based hyperthermia and its combination with chemoradiotherapy have been used as noninvasive cancer treatments to induce cancer cell apoptosis or cause the direct destruction of tumor cells or reduction in nodule volume for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules [18\u201324]. MWs have been also used in the early detection and imaging of breast cancer by dual-mode or thermoacoustic imaging model. Continuous MW exposure could be beneficial for biological functions such as an increase in the healing of wounds (septic and aseptic) and intracranial hematoma detection [8\u201317].\nMWs also have considerable health-damaging effects, particularly on the nervous system [21\u201330]. Long-term MW exposure or MW radiation in the range of 860\u20132450\u00a0MHz had significant effects on the brain, such as inductions of hippocampus injury, neurotransmitter disruption, and cognitive impairment [21\u201330]. Pulsed and dose-dependent MWs affect the autoimmunity and immunomodulation by functional and morphological injuries in the natural killer (NK-92) [31]. Kerimoglu et al. reported that continuous exposure to an electromagnetic field impairs the morphological and biochemical levels [32]. Wang et al. investigated the effect of pulsed MWs on bone marrow cells at a frequency of 2.856\u00a0GHz [33]. Szymanski et al. reported the electromagnetic immunomodulatory effects on atopic-dermatitis-modified keratinocytes [34]. In addition, MW radiation can induce skin cancer in mice and brain tissues [35]. Various mathematical models also studied which helps to realize the dynamical procedures of biology population changes [36\u201341]. Skin is located on the outermost layer of the body, which exposed frequently to the physical stimuli, toxic chemicals, radiations with short and long wavelengths, and environmental contaminations. The effects of sunlight on the skin have been well established [42\u201345]. Radiations with longer wavelengths are gathering attention for their effects on skin health. However, the effect of the pulsed HPM radiation with nanosecond pulse duration is largely unknown in skin biology.\nIn this study, we aimed to determine the effects of pulsed HPM with nanosecond pulse duration at a frequency of 3.5\u00a0GHz on melanoma and fibroblast cells. The possible effects at cellular and molecular levels were evaluated with respect to the cellular growth and energetics. We assessed the cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation and cell death, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nCell culture\nHuman melanoma cell lines G-361 (ATCC\u00ae CRL-1424\u2122) and SK-Mel-31 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-73\u2122) were purchased from Korean Cell Line Bank. A normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cell line (Cat # CC-2511) was purchased from Lonza (Walkersville, Maryland, USA). All cell lines were cultured and stored according to the manufacturers\u2019 protocols. The G-361, SK-Mel-31, and NHDF cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U\/mL of penicillin, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL of streptomycin, minimum essential medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 100 U\/mL of penicillin, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL of streptomycin, and fibroblast basal medium with supplied 100 U\/mL of penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL of streptomycin, respectively. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and subcultured every three to four days.\n\n\nMW exposure system\nVarious sources can be used to generate HPMs. Among them, the virtual cathode oscillator (vircator) was considered as the most promising source owing to its ability to generate MWs with high power. In this study, an axial vircator was designed for the generation of MWs. A relativistic HPM generator device (Chundoong) was used. This device uses a relativistic electron beam to generate MWs having high power in the range of several hundred megawatts to gigawatt levels [46\u201348]. Fig. 1\n shows a schematic of the device used in this study. Marx bank consisted of 12 capacitors; each capacitor had a capacitance of 0.2 \u03bcF. It utilized a high voltage when the capacitors were discharged in the series with a trigger shot after 1\u00a0min of charging at a voltage of 20\u00a0kV. In this device, the characteristics of relativistic electron beam reached the maximum values (voltage of 600\u00a0kV, current of 88 kA, and pulse duration of 60\u00a0ns) when the characteristic impedance (6.8\u00a0\u03a9) of the pulse-forming line (PFL) was matched to that of the field-emission diode in vacuum [46,47]. The drift tube had a length of 25\u00a0cm and an inner diameter of 20\u00a0cm. Diode and drift tube regions were evacuated down to \n\n1.5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n-\n5\n\n\n\n Torr in this experiment. The end part of the drift tube was sealed using an acrylic window with a thickness of 1.5\u00a0cm to maintain the vacuum and electron bombardment. It also allowed MW to propagation outside the drift tube. Targat sample was placed 25\u00a0cm away from the window where it was exposed to different doses of electromagnetic energy by varying the number of shots 1, 5, 15, and 45 shots (each shot given after one minute) of pulsed MW radiation (1 shot\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0J). The temperature of the cell medium is measured by using a thermal imager FLUKE Ti90. The temperature was measured by placing the cell medium in the treatment room when the room temperature is 25\u00a0\u00b0C. After 5-min and 45-min placing the cell medium, the temperature of the cell medium was measured in two conditions, without MW exposure (control) and with microwave exposure (treated).\n\n\nCell viability assay\nAlamar blue (AB; ThermoFisher Scientific DAL1025) dye was used to assess the viabilities of the melanoma and fibroblast cells upon the exposure to MWs. For the AB cell viability experiments, all cells (G-361, SK-Mel, and NHDF) were seeded at a density of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells per well (100\u00a0\u00b5L) in 96-well plates. We performed the experiments in triplicates (or more); each set contained a control (unexposed to MWs). After 5, 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h of incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with a prewarmed 1X Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Welgene Cat # LB 001-02) with pH 7.4. An AB solution (10% v\/v) was prepared in the medium, added to each well according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and incubated for 1\u00a0h as carried out in our previous work [49]. The AB conversion was measured by a plate-reading spectrometer (BioTek) by monitoring the fluorescence as a measure of the AB dye conversion using 540-nm excitation and 595-nm emission.\n\n\nCell death and apoptosis assay\nCell death upon the MW exposure was determined by evaluating the propidium iodide (PI) uptake of the cells. PI was commercially purchased (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) and prepared in PBS (Gibco) at a concentration of 1\u00a0mg\/mL as a working stock solution. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting, 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells\/well of G361, SK-Mel-31, and NHDF (12 wells for each sample) were seeded in 96-well plates. After 24\u00a0h of MW exposure, the cells were washed with PBS and harvested using 0.25% trypsin\u2013ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (HyClone, Cat # SH30042.01) for 2\u20133\u00a0min, followed by the addition of the medium supplemented with 10% FBS to neutralize the effects of trypsinization and centrifugation to obtain a pellet. The pellet was resuspended with PBS containing PI and subjected to flow cytometry acquisition and analysis. In addition, the apoptosis of the cells was determined using a Real-Time-GloTM Apoptosis kit (Promega (Ref JA1011)). This assay enables the luminescence-based detection of phosphatidyl-serine exposure indicative of apoptosis of the cells. For this purpose, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells\/well of G361 were seeded in 96-well plates in octuplicates. After 24\u00a0h of MW exposure, an equal amount of 2X detection reagent was added to media, mixed, and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The luminescence was measured using a BioTek microplate reader.\n\n\nATP assay\nATP generation was assessed following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Cell Titer-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega - G7572)). All (G-361 and SK-Mel) cells were seeded at a density of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells per well (100\u00a0\u00b5L) in 96-well plates. After the exposure to MWs for 24\u00a0h of incubation, one volume of the prewarmed reagent was added to the cells. After 2\u00a0h of incubation at room temperature, the luminescence was measured using a microplate reader.\n\n\nProliferation assay\nThe cell growth was monitored using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution \u2013 Promega (Ref G3580), a colorimetric method utilizing the interaction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium with phenazine methosulfate to form a colored formazon product only in the presence of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen\/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen from metabolically active cells. First, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells\/well of G361, SK-Mel-31, and NHDF were seeded in 96-well plates in octuplicates. Twenty-four hours after the seeding, the cells were exposed to MWs (5 and 45 shots) while the control cells were not exposed. After the MW exposure, the cells were incubated for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation, one-fifth of the volume of the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One solution was added into each well and incubated for 2\u00a0h. The absorbance at 490\u00a0nm (A\n490) was measured using the Bio-Tek microplate reader.\n\n\nMitochondrial assay\nMammalian cells generate ATP by mitochondrial (oxidative phosphorylation) and nonmitochondrial (glycolysis) mechanisms. Mitochondrial ToxGlo\u2122 Assay (Promega G8000) is a cell-based assay primarily used to predict mitochondrial dysfunction. The assay can be used to measure ATP generated by mitochondria, which can be indicative of mitochondrial activity. ATP is measured by adding the ATP detection reagent, leading to cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal that is proportional to the amount of ATP. ATP detection reagent consists of an optimized formulation for ATP detection containing luciferin, ATPase inhibitors, and thermo-stable Ultra-Glo\u2122 luciferase. For this assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells\/well of G361 were seeded in 96-well plates in octuplicates. After 24\u00a0h of seeding, the cells were exposed to MWs (5 and 45 shots), while the control cells were not exposed. After the MW exposure, the cells were incubated for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation, the cells were processed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The ATP levels were measured using a luminometer.\n\n\nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) activity\nThe effect on the production of free oxygen radicals was assessed by measuring the SOD activity using an Enzychrome (ESOD-100) assay kit (colorimetric assay). In the assay, superoxide (O\u2212\n2) is provided by xanthine oxidase, which reacts with the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 dye to form a colored product. First, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells\/well of G361 were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate. Twenty-four hours after the MW exposure, the cells were washed with a cold PBS, lysed with a cold lysis buffer, and then centrifuged to obtain the supernatant of cellular extract. Subsequently, 20\u00a0\u03bcL of the supernatant was mixed with the working reagent (including the assay buffer, xanthine, and WST-1). Xanthine oxidase was added to each sample and mixed. The absorbance at 440\u00a0nm (A\n440) was measured after 0 and 60\u00a0min, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\n\nMolecular analysis (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR))\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from the samples using the Trizol reagent (Ambion). An RNA quantification was performed using a NanoDrop\u2122 spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All real-time PCRs were determined using an SYBR Green Master Mix (Biorad Laboratories, Inc., Korea). Sample amplification reactions were carried out in a Rotor Gene Q (Qiagen, Korea). The results are expressed as the fold change calculated by the \u0394\u0394Ct method relative to the control sample. \u03b2-actin was used for normalization as a control. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1\n.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe experimental results were plotted using the Microsoft Excel software (2013, for Windows) and Graph Pad Prism as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of three independent experiments. The significance was assessed using the Student\u2019s t-test. The differences were considered statistically significant when p was lower than 0.05 (p values: *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\n\n\n\nResults\n\nPhysical characteristics of the MW exposure device\n\nFig. 2\n(a) shows the peaks of the diode voltage (260\u00a0kV) and diode current (10 kA). The target sample was placed 25\u00a0cm away from the acrylic window. At each trigger shot, an HPM pulse was generated, which propagated toward the target sample. The average power of the MWs reaching the target sample at each trigger shot was 20\u00a0MW, as shown by the microwave envelope signal in Fig. 2(b), which corresponds to an electromagnetic energy delivered to the cells at each trigger shot of approximately 0.6\u00a0J. The MW generation from vircator was described in details in our previous studies [46,48]. The dominant frequency of the MWs was 3.5\u00a0GHz, determined by fast Fourier transform. The frequency spectrum is shown in Fig. 2(c). The measured temperatures of the cell medium before and after the MW exposure are shown in Fig. 2(d) (the room temperature was 25\u00a0\u00b0C). After 5-min and 45-min temperature was measured in the cell medium without MW exposure in control and with microwave exposure in the treatment group. The temperature of the cell medium does not show any change after the exposure because of the nanosecond pulse duration of MW and 1\u00a0min gap between each shot.\n\n\nEffects of the HPM radiation on the viabilities of the melanoma and fibroblast cells\nIn this work, the melanoma (G-361 and SK-Mel-31) and fibroblast (NHDF) cells were exposed to the pulsed HPMs at low and high doses of electromagnetic energy. The cell viability was determined by the AB assay. The dose-dependent behaviors of the melanoma G361 and NHDF cells were evaluated 24\u00a0h after the MW exposure, as shown in supplementary Fig. S1. Based on these results, the low dose of 5 shots and a high dose of 45 shots were used in further investigations. The obtained results 5\u00a0h after the MW exposure (Fig. 3\n(a), (e), and (i)) show that the viability of the MW-exposed melanoma cells was increased compared to that of the control cells. The low dose of MW exposure did not significantly affect the NHDF cells, while the high dose changed the viability of the NHDF cells to a significant level. Fig. 3(b), (f), and (j) show the viabilities of the cells 24\u00a0h after the MW exposure. The cell viability continued to increase. High dose of MW exposure led to a significantly higher viability than that of the unexposed melanoma G-361 cells, without affecting the morphology (Fig. S2). The SK-Mel-31 cells exhibited an increased viability at the high dose, while the effect of the low dose was insignificant. On the other hand, the NHDF cells did not exhibit significant changes in viability at both low and high doses after 24\u00a0h. Further, incubation after the MW exposure was prolonged and cell viabilities were determined after 48 and 72\u00a0h (Fig. 3(c), (g), and (k) and (d), (h), and (l), respectively). Notably, no significant changes in the MW-exposed groups were observed, compared to the unexposed groups of both melanoma (G-361 and SK-Mel-31) and fibroblast cells. The figures show that the MW exposure at the high dose led to slightly increased viabilities of the melanoma (G-361 and SK-Mel-31) and fibroblast (NHDF) cells after 5\u00a0h. The maximum value was observed after 24\u00a0h for the G-361 cells at a high dose. The melanoma G361 and SK-Mel-31 cells exhibited similar responses indicated by the viability patterns at the early time moment, 5\u00a0h after the exposure. A significant proliferation of the G361 cells was observed after 24\u00a0h, while no significant changes were observed after 48 and 72\u00a0h. The NHDF cells reacted to the MW exposure at the early time moment, while no significant changes were observed after the prolonged incubation. Considering these results, the G-361 cells exposed to the MW radiation (5 and 45 shots) and incubated for 24\u00a0h were used in the subsequent experiments.\n\n\nEffect of the HPM radiation on the cell death\nTo investigate whether the MW exposure leads to death of the melanoma and fibroblast cells, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates, exposed to MW radiations (5 and 45 shots), and incubated for 24\u00a0h. The cell death induced by the MW exposure until 24\u00a0h of incubation after the exposure was determined by the PI uptake, indicative of a dysfunctional plasma membrane. As shown in Fig. 4\n(a) and (b), the histogram analysis indicates no significant variations in the MW-exposed groups with respect to the control groups of both melanoma cell populations. In addition, the scatter plot for the fibroblast cells shows insignificant variations in the MW-exposed groups compared to the control (Fig. 4(c)). Overall, the death of melanoma and fibroblast cells was not observed after the pulsed MW exposures at both low and high doses.\n\n\nEffects of the HPM radiation on the mitochondrial energetics\nTo investigate whether the increase in proliferation of the melanoma cells after the MW exposure is attributed to changes in cellular energetics, the proliferation, apoptosis, mitochondrial activity, ATP level, and oxygen radical regulation were assessed using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution, Promega Apoptosis, Mitotox and ATP, CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability, and Enzychrome SOD activity assays, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5\n(a), the ATP levels, indicative of proliferation, were high in the MW-exposed groups, which did not exhibit alteration in apoptotic rate (Fig. 5(b)). The mitochondrial released and cellular ATP levels are presented in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. The ATP was also evaluated in SK-Mel-31 and NHDF 24\u00a0h after the MW exposure; the results are shown in Fig. S3.\nATP level was significantly increased only in the melanoma cells of the MW-exposed group, compared to that of the control group. We analyzed whether the increase in ATP level is associated with the antioxidant activity response of the cells. As shown in Fig. 5(e), the SOD activity level, indicative of primary antioxidant response, was unaffected upon the MW exposure. The figures indicate that the MW exposure enhanced the cellular proliferation possibly through the increased ATP level independent of the SOD activity in the melanoma cells, while the fibroblast cells were unaffected.\nThe above analyses demonstrate that the MW radiation remarkably affected the melanoma and fibroblast cells. In this regard, we aimed to analyze the mechanisms responsible for the differential effects on the cells. To this end, we performed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of the G361 melanoma cells and evaluated the MW effects on the proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and mitochondrial activity. Notably, the MW radiation considerably increased the Ki67 and cellular myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) proliferation gene levels, while the apoptotic genes caspase (CASP3) and (CASP9) and cell cycle regulatory genes were slightly affected or unchanged (Fig. 6\n(a) and (b)). The mitochondrial ATP synthase ATP5A1 level was significantly increased, while the Adenosine triphosphatase ATP2B1 level was significantly reduced upon the MW radiation, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Also, the cell division markers remain unaffected, as shown in Fig. 6(c). These data suggest that the increased levels of ATP are responsible for the enhanced ATP uptake in the melanoma cells in response to the MW radiation, as shown in Fig. 5(d).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nMW radiation increased the viability and proliferation of the melanoma cells within 24\u00a0h and its effect was reduced to insignificant levels after 48 and 72\u00a0h. The normal fibroblast cells were unaffected even after 72\u00a0h (Fig. 3). MWs could enhance the tumorigenesis of skin cancer [35]. In addition, low to moderate heat exposures induced heat shock protein expression, strongly associated with thermo-tolerance [50,51]. These results indicate highly proliferative and resistant structures of the melanoma cells towards heat. MW-induced hyperthermia-based treatments of melanoma could not achieve a significant disease-free survival rate or complete abolishment of cancer cells [18]. In our study, the viability and proliferation assay results showed the high proliferation ability of the melanoma cells after the MW exposure, while the proliferation rate of the normal fibroblast cells was unchanged. Yonezawa\u2019s group reported that the heating up to or above 43\u00a0\u00b0C could induce apoptosis only in malignant fibrous histiocytoma, compared to various soft tissue and osteosarcoma cell lines [52]. At least a few cell types could exhibit different sensitivities toward heat-induced cell death. Our study demonstrates that the MW exposure does not induce death of the melanoma and fibroblast cells (Fig. 4).\nIn this study, the ATP level and mitochondrial activity were increased 24\u00a0h after the MW exposure only in the melanoma cells, unlike in the fibroblast cells (Figs. 5 and S4). The mitochondrial activity and ATP level are directly correlated with cell growth and cell death [53]. A high ATP level leads to increased cell viability and proliferation, often used for its assessment [54\u201357]. Our results also showed high cellular and mitochondrial released ATP levels in response to the MW exposure of the melanoma cells in line with the increased viability and proliferation (Fig. 5). Notably, no significant changes in the ATP level in the normal fibroblast cells were observed. This indicates a larger sensitization of melanoma cells toward MWs than that of normalized fibroblast cells. Continuous exposure to an electromagnetic field or MWs can regulate cellular functions at the morphological, biochemical, and gene expression levels [54\u201357]. Our PCR results showed that the MW exposure of the melanoma cells enhanced the expressions of genes associated with proliferation and ATP synthesis without altering the genes required for cell cycle and apoptosis (Fig. 6). Also stimulus by any physical or chemical treatment may enhance ATP production and release in these cancerous cells. In this research proliferation of melanoma cancer cells is enhanced after exposure of pulsed MW, possibly this is the reason that ATP level is increased more in melanoma cells.\nThe cellular ATP level and mitochondrial function are often associated with SOD activity. The mitochondrial respiratory chain leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl radicals (OH\u22c5), superoxide (O2\u22c5\u2212), and peroxide (O2\n2\u2212) [58]. SOD, a mitochondrially localized antioxidant enzyme, catalyzes the conversion of these superoxides to hydrogen peroxide and is up-regulated owing to the mitochondrial dysfunction [59]. Melanoma cells tend to alter and adapt metabolic compensatory strategies for viability and growth [60]. Our results indicate that the MW exposure did not alter the SOD activity in the melanoma cells (Fig. 5). This result indicates alternative antioxidant mechanisms for the regulation of the levels of free radicals produced by mitochondria for an enhanced proliferation.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study reveals that the MW exposure led to increased cell growth and proliferation specific to melanoma after 24\u00a0h, which could be attributed to the increased mitochondrial activity by the increased ATP level. The MW exposure did not affect the normal fibroblast cells at the considered doses, while it altered the melanoma cell physiology in a cell-type specific manner. Therefore, MW exposure may be utilized with mitotic inhibitory chemotherapeutic drugs for melanoma cells and should be considered while analyzing melanoma cells in vitro. Further investigations are required to study the cellular signaling upon MW exposure.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","59":"\n\nIntroduction\nTraditionally, surplus gases in refinery plants have been disposed of by flaring to the atmosphere. Currently, this type of disposal is becoming an inferior solution for reducing emissions to the atmosphere, while simultaneously conserving energy. Therefore, the pressing demand for processes that can safely and economically use these surplus gases is rapidly increasing. In this context, the \u201clight ends\u201d process is the only process in modern refinery plants that is designed to separate almost pure components from crude oil [1]. Light end processing units have several stages of separation and fractionation that are used to separate light fractions from heavier fractions and purify contaminants, mainly sulfur, from lighter fractions. Usually, at least two light end processing units, a saturated gas plant (SGP) and an un-saturated gas plant, exist in very large refinery plants. Both are open art technologies and have some similarities in the arrangement and sequence of the process. However, the main differences between these units mostly relate to the location of each separation unit, type of feed and, subsequently, type of products. In principle, un-saturated gas plants are usually adjacent to cracking units for producing olefin streams, whereas SGPs are usually located adjacent to isomerization, naphtha hydro-treating and atmospheric crude distillation units (CDUs) for producing paraffinic streams [2].\nOptimization applications are frequently applied as prominent tasks in all areas of process systems engineering from model and process development to process synthesis and design, and finally to process operations control, process safety analysis, planning and scheduling [3\u20138]. In essence, energy conservation is the most important rule of sustainable design optimization since it is considered a key part in saving money in the long term. Energy conservation concepts should be implemented on an ongoing basis at all stages of asset lifecycle development. In most chemical process plants, an enormous amount of energy of up to approximately 40% of the total energy consumption is consumed in an intensive way in separation and purification processes [9]. In many cases, separation processes are commonly conducted by using distillation towers that have a wide variety of uses throughout the industry because of their ability to split feed streams into pure components or mixtures of components with similar boiling points [10]. Undoubtedly, optimization of the operating conditions of distillation towers is the most crucial step to minimize energy consumption and consequently reduce the total annual cost (TAC) of the whole plant. This optimization is accentuated because it contributes, in turn, to the determination of the number of pumps and compressors stages, electricity consumption, and types\/amount of heating and cooling sources that are used in any plant. Although the number of trays has the primary impact on the capital cost in terms of the total height of the tower, this number is also optimized based on energy consumption regarding the total duty.\nUsually, a sophisticated simulation-based optimization is required to optimize distillation towers. Since sensitivity analysisprovides good intuition about how various parameters affect the objective function, and to rank the parameters [11], this analysis is usually used as a part of the optimization process to minimize the calculation time of the optimization algorithm employed. In this regard, much attention has been paid to mathematical programming for optimization problems related to distillation columns. To reliably provide rigorous stage-by-stage equilibrium optimization models for distillation towers for finding the optimal feed locations and the optimum number of trays, mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) [12\u201315] or generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) [16\u201318] is usually used. The first reliable model used to obtain the optimum number of stages and optimum feed locations for an individual distillation tower was executed by using MINLP [19,20]. However, there were some shortcomings and difficulties in these models that were solved by using a GDP representation [21]. These shortcomings were due to the enforcement of vapor-liquid equilibrium conditions on all trays of the tower, and this enforcement could produce numerical problems as a result of the convergence of the equilibrium equation. Many difficulties exist in using MINLP or GDP techniques related to the need for expert persons in the areas of programming, modelling and optimization to adapt to different types of problems such as initialization of models, debugging, and determining how to guarantee the accuracy of results and similar aspects [21\u201323]. All problems related to the initialization and convergence of distillation columns are nearly settled when a process simulator is integrated with an external optimizer. As an example, the first integrated model was developed by integrating of HYSYS with both MATLAB and GAMS-CPLEX [24].\nCommercial process software, e.g., Aspen HYSYS\u00ae, is considered \u201cmodular architecture\u201d, which means that any process plant or any complex systems can be built and divided into sub-components (modules) without affecting the rest of the system [25]. Flow sheets can be decomposed into blocks or modules (e.g., distillation column, absorption column, \u2026, etc.) that can be interpreted, debugged, and coded by themselves [26]. Both debugging and initialization difficulties in the equation-based models are solved in HYSYS. HYSYS-Optimizer can be used for sensitivity analysis (what-if studies) or as a single-step optimization method to find the operating conditions that locally minimize or maximize an objective function. In addition, in the first integrated model, the decision variables sent from the solver at each time must converge; otherwise, the whole algorithm will fail. Therefore, the independent variables should be selected carefully to converge at any initial point [24]. In HYSYS-Optimizer, neither the embedded code nor derivative information is accessible to users since all existing processing units in commercial simulators are \u201cblack box\u201d models [19]. This concern should be taken into consideration since gradient-based algorithms always depend on precise derivative information from the process simulator. In this regard, many attempts have been reported in the literature to couple a process simulator with an external optimization tool to overcome the simulator-optimizer limitations. In general, the literature predominantly uses this coupling to optimize a few individual units at small scales while paying more attention to optimizing discrete design decisions. However, bridging the gap to scalable continuous design variables is indispensable for industry. For example, to overcome the limitations related to derivative-optimization techniques, a genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were used as stochastic algorithms [27\u201329]. Aspen HYSYS was linked with a GA built-in MATLAB code to externally optimize and control HYSYS in a successful way to minimize shaft power requirements for an LNG refrigeration cycle [30,31]. The optimization was performed to optimize the refrigerant composition and the operating conditions for the whole loop based on the selected composition. In addition, HYSYS was linked with PSO to optimize a configuration of distillation towers in terms of the optimum number of stages and the optimum feed location, based on TAC, for three different distillation systems [32]. Moreover, Aspen HYSYS and a stochastic optimization strategy for simulation and optimization were linked to determine the design variables for a crude oil separation process to maximize profits [33].\nThe purpose of this work is to apply a simulation-based optimization strategy for optimizing operating conditions for a whole plant in an effective and reliable way through coupling Aspen HYSYS and MATLAB. The strategy adopted is a merge between sensitivity analysis and constrained bounding of the variables along with either GA or PSO stochastic optimization algorithms. As a real case study, the procedure has been applied to an entire SGP that will be established in Egypt to produce LPG and stabilized naphtha. The plant represents a highly non-linear case with more than 100-components and comprises interacting three-phase fractionation towers, pumps, compressors, and exchangers. The remarkable challenge is determining how to handle the large numbers of equipment, continuous constraints, and variables in a corrective way without deviation from the feasible solution. The performance and results of both GA and PSO optimization algorithms have been discussed.\n\n\nMethodology\n\nSimulation problem: the case study\nThe refinery plant that is studied in this work mainly consists of two crude distillation units (CDU 1 and 2), including an existing SGP unit that recovers the gases produced from CDU (1). In this refinery plant, a new SGP (green field) with a design capacity of 400,000 ton\/year is planned to be installed in parallel to the existing one. This SGP will be flexible to serve one or both CDUs in addition to the naphtha complex effluent streams to finally produce LPG and stabilized naphtha. The naphtha complex effluent streams are the sour off-gas from naphtha hydro-treating, off-specification LPG from continuous catalytic regeneration, off-gas from continuous catalytic regeneration, and off-gas from isomerization.\nThe new SGP is required to handle both design and future modes without any overdesign margin. In the design mode, two vapor streams and two liquid light naphtha streams from two different CDUs are directed to the new SGP. The vapor streams are combined and then compressed to the fractionation section and the two liquid light naphtha streams are mixed and then pumped to the same destination. In the future mode, the naphtha complex effluent streams will be routed to the new SGP with the same design capacity of 400,000 ton\/year as the design mode without any overdesign margin. Fig. 1\nA shows a simple schematic block flow diagram with boundary limits for the process while Fig. 1B shows the detailed process flow diagram showing both the base and future modes.\nAspen HYSYS simulation package v. 8.6 was used in developing the process model. The Peng-Robinson thermodynamic fluid property package [34] was used throughout the simulation.\n\nPretreatment facilities\nThe process starts by saturation of the feeds with water before entrance to the pretreatment facilities. In these facilities, further free-water separation and adjustment of the operating conditions are performed before sending these streams to the fractionation sections. Pretreatment facilities are required to alleviate the load of water-separation on the fractionation train, enhance the efficiency of separation, and adjust the operating conditions needed to meet the product specifications.\n\nCompression station package\nThe pressure ratio across the two compression stages (with polytrophic efficiency of 75%) in the existing train is limited to 3.5. Thus, the maximum discharge pressure for the collated vapors after saturation with water is 0.9\u00a0MPa. The delivered pressure of the collated vapors from naphtha complex effluent streams in the future mode is also limited to 0.85\u00a0MPa as a design basis.\n\n\nNaphtha-receiving three-phase separator\nThe collated water streams from the knock-out drums of compressors are sent to three-phase separator with the incoming light naphtha streams. The gas vapor stream is then recycled to the inlet vapor streams, the light naphtha is routed to the deethanizer tower for further separation, and the separated free water is sent to an existing sour water system.\n\n\n\nFractionation train\nThe fractionation train consists of two distillation towers (a deethanizer and debutanizer). A depropanizer does not exist since the LPG composition is fixed with a certain vapor pressure limit to be used in the local market. Some common practices and design criteria considered for the fractionation train are as follows:\n\n\u2022\nThe inlet feed temperature should match the tray temperature.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe internal temperature profile should be normal without any vertical or horizontal asymptote.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u201cHYSIM Inside-Out\u201d is used as a built-in solving method for the three-phases (water, gas, and hydrocarbon liquid) distillation for extracting water from the trays expected to have water by having water withdrawal streams.\n\n\n\n\nDeethanizer\nThe deethanizer is simulated using the abovementioned criteria to recover C1 and C2 from the overhead, while the slipped C3\u00a0+\u00a0is withdrawn from the bottom and then routed to the debutanizer, as shown in Fig. 2\nA. The deethanizer tower is considered to be a combination between two sections, an absorber in the top section and a conventional fractionation tower in the bottom section, rather than separating them into two standalone towers. The absorber section is considered to be a tray tower, not a packed tower, because higher flow rates of liquid and gases require larger diameters [35]. Stabilized naphtha is used as lean oil in the primary absorber due to the high absorption factor, which leads to a lower flow rate. However, some naphtha is lost to the off-gas due to equilibrium. An overhead full reflux condenser (shell and tube heat exchanger) utilizing sea water for condensation is used with a recommended minimum temperature approach of 10\u00a0\u00b0C as per common practice. The recycled stabilized naphtha is preferred to be routed to the overhead condenser to increase absorption efficiency.\n\n\nDebutanizer\nThe debutanizer is simulated to recover commercial C3\/C4 (LPG) from the overhead condensate, while the stabilized naphtha is from the reboiler, as shown in Fig. 2B. An overhead full reflux condenser (shell and tube heat exchanger), utilizing sea water for condensation with a temperature approach of 10\u00a0\u00b0C, was used.\n\n\nSponge absorber\nTo recover the lost stabilized naphtha escaping with the off-gas (fuel gas) from the deethanizer, heavier absorption oil (with a lower absorption factor than the stabilized naphtha) is used in the second stage (sponge absorber) to absorb the stabilized naphtha from the first stage of absorption (Fig. 2C). The sponge-oil rate is conventionally adjusted to control the C5\u00a0+\u00a0in the off-gas to lower than 0.5% to reach an overall C5\u00a0+\u00a0recovery of 99.8%. The overhead gases from the sponge oil absorber are directed to an existing fuel gas system, while the rich sponge oil is returned to the existing CDU (2). The exact amount of sponge oil should be determined by integrating the sponge absorber with CDU (2). In common practice, the number of theoretical stages of a sponge absorber ranges from approximately 3 to 5 theoretical stages with a tray efficiency of 20% [36].\n\n\n\nHeat integration\nMedium pressure steam is available at the plant. However, to minimize the amount of steam, it is used only for the reboiler of the debutanizer. On the other hand, the bottom of the deethanizer is reboiled by the hot outlet stream (stabilized naphtha) from the debutanizer reboiler. The stabilized naphtha is then routed to heat the light naphtha feed and, is finally cooled to 43\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n\nSensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analysis was first performed on the HYSYS model as a single step optimization to identify the local optimum points before applying the optimization techniques to determine the influence of all parameters on the outcomes. Instead of using the GAMS solver, the sensitivity analysis technique was conservatively conducted on the fractionation section to provide the closest configuration to the optimum design by determining the optimum number of stages and the optimum feed locations.\nThen, the HYSYS model was optimized by tuning the most influential design variables in the range of the constrained bounds for each design variable to be an input for the optimization stage. The optimization was implemented through a linkage between HYSYS and MATLAB. Finally, after implementation of the optimization techniques, sensitivity analysiswas performed on the selected algorithm to test the robustness of the objective function to small changes in the values of the optimized parameters and\/or small changes in the initial values.\n\n\nImplicit-constraints and assumptions\nThe implicit constraints are imposed on HYSYS model through a large list of \u201ccolumn specification\u201d that gives the possibility to select from different operating conditions as degrees of freedom for the tower. Thus, there was no need to add explicit constrains for the objective function. The implicit constraints were done based on surrounding environment conditions, process design guarantee, specifications, and common standard practice in the field. These implicit constraints are:\n\n\u2022\nSince cooling water maximum temperature in summer is 33\u00a0\u00b0C, the overhead temperature of the deethanizer and debutanizer is not lower than 43\u00a0\u00b0C to keep the minimum temperature approach to 10\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe recovery of C5\u00a0+\u00a0in the bottom of the deethanizer is not less than 97% to decrease the amount of naphtha that may carry up with ascending vapor.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe overall recovery of n-C4 in each of the deethanizer and debutanizer is not less than 92% as a process guarantee for the whole plant.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe recovery of C3 in the bottom of the deethanizer is not less than 90% to avoid exceeding the maximum limit of LPG vapor pressure per Egyptian specification.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe maximum liquid volume percentage of C2 in LPG stream is 5% per Egyptian LPG specification.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe maximum liquid volume percentage of C5\u00a0+\u00a0in LPG stream, equivalent to final boiling point test, is 5% per Egyptian LPG specification.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe available steam in the plant is medium pressure steam with maximum temperature around 160\u00a0\u00b0C within range of pressure of 7\u20138 bars.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe maximum shipping envelope length for distillation towers is 35\u00a0m. This is specified according to limit of feasible transport.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe tray spacing has been taken to be 0.9\u00a0m as a conservative space.\n\n\n\u2022\nAbsorber efficiency has been taken about 20%, whereas the normal distillation tower efficiency has been taken about 60% per common practice.\n\n\n\nTo develop a precise pressure profile across SGP, some realistic assumptions and calculations are made to determine the discharge pressure and the temperature required to flow the gas\/liquid streams through the equipment until the boundary limits. The following assumptions were considered in the simulation:\n\n\u2022\nEvery heat transfer equipment has a pressure drop around 0.0345\u00a0MPa, except for deethanizer and debutanizer reboilers, and deethanizer feed preheater, in which the pressure drop has been around 0.0689\u00a0MPa.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe minimum temperature approach in all water cooler\/condensers is 10\u00a0\u00b0C, as per common practice for shell and tube heat exchangers.\n\n\n\nFinally, since feed gas compositions are available on a dry basis, water saturation utility tool in HYSYS has been used to get gas composition on a wet basis. It is important to note that HYSYS model assumes theoretical trays with vapor and liquid phases are in equilibrium on each tray. However, the economic costs have been calculated based on the actual number of trays and actual height.\n\n\nOptimization-simulation methodology\nAspen HYSYS [37] is automated by MATLAB (R2015a) as the external solver, which programmatically runs HYSYS as a front-end. All simulation calculations, thermodynamic properties, and physical properties calculations were done by HYSYS side. On the other hand, MATLAB programmatically controlled black-box functions inside HYSYS and took all relevant decisions to attain the optimum design with the appropriately selected algorithm (GA or PSO).\n\nObjective function\nIndeed, coupling HYSYS with external software for optimization such as MATLAB requires the objective function to be well-defined in terms of process design variables (input to HYSYS) and process design parameters (output from HYSYS). The objective function selected for the current work is the TAC, which comprises two main terms for operating cost and capital cost (Equation (1)) [38]:\n\n(1)\n\n\nTAC\n=\nF\n\u00d7\n\nC\n\nCap\n\n\n+\n\nC\n\nOp\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\nTAC: Total annual cost\n\n\nF: Annualization factor\n\n\nCCap: Capital cost\n\n\nCOp: Operating cost\n\n\n\nThe annualization factor (F) of the capital cost is calculated by (Equation (2)) [39]:\n\n(2)\n\n\nF\n=\n\n\ni\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n(\n1\n+\ni\n)\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\ni\n\n\n\nn\n\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\ni: fractional interest rate per year. A typical value for (i) is 10% per common practice.\n\n\n\nn: years over which the capital is to be annualized. A typical value for n is 5\u00a0years per common practice\n\n\n\nFor the current plant, distillation towers and heat exchangers (condensers and reboilers) have the main impact on the capital cost. Compressors and pumps are the only other equipment available in the plant. For compressors, per the current real case study, an old compression station with two compression stages with their accessories from the refinery plant was intended to be used. Accordingly, their power consumption only has been included as operating cost. For pumps, their capital cost change is trivial and negligible compared to that of the towers and heat exchangers. Accordingly, only their operating cost was included. In reality, pumps are usually designed based on the maximum flow rate with multi-impellers.\nThe capital cost of heat exchangers depends on the calculated areas of condensers and reboilers of towers. The area of exchangers is a function of heat duties and the logarithmic mean temperature difference. Similarly, the cost of a tower is a function of the diameter, height, and operating pressure of the tower. The capital cost of the towers was calculated based on the maximum diameter that is produced from the maximum vapor rate in the future mode as the worst-case scenario and the actual maximum height. After inserting the values of the diameter and actual height in the capital cost function of the towers, this function becomes a function of only the operating pressure [40]. On the other hand, the operating cost was estimated based on the cost of medium pressure steam, cooling water and electricity that are consumed in each tower for 330\u00a0days per year operation [38]. The details of the TAC calculations are in the supporting information.\nUsing sensitivity analysis, there are five process design variables (input to HYSYS) that are required to completely specify the simulated case study. To expedite the optimization process, the number of generations\/iterations needed to find an optimum solution can be minimized by decreasing the number of design variables to only three design variables as follows:\n\n\u2022\nBottom pressure of the deethanizer (Peth).\n\n\n\u2022\nBottom pressure of the debutanizer (Pbut).\n\n\n\u2022\nSplit ratio (recycled flow rate of stabilized naphtha) (W).\n\n\n\nThe other two process design variables (top pressures of the deethanizer and debutanizer) were taken as 0.05\u00a0MPa lower than their corresponding tower bottom pressures. This helped in decreasing the time from HYSYS to MATLAB and decreasing the total computational time. Apart from the elapsed time as a result of the executed algorithm, the optimization process can be expedited by minimizing the maximum number of iterations that is adjusted by the HYSYS solver itself to be only 150 iterations for the distillation column.\nThe process design parameters (output from HYSYS) included in the objective function are:\n\n\u2022\nHeat duty of deethanizer\u2019s condenser (Qcond)\n\n\n\u2022\nHeat duties of the debutanizer\u2019s condenser and reboiler (Qconb and Qreb)\n\n\n\u2022\nPower of the first and second stages of the compressor (PWa and PWb)\n\n\n\u2022\nPower of the light naphtha pump, booster pump and stabilized naphtha pump (PWc, PWd, and PWe)\n\n\n\u2022\nOverhead temperatures of the deethanizer and debutanizer (TOVa and TOVb)\n\n\n\u2022\nBottom temperatures of the deethanizer and debutanizer (TBOTa and TBOTb)\n\n\n\nAfter accessing HYSYS through an ActiveX server and activating a HYSYS case from MATLAB, almost all unit operations in HYSYS become accessible as automated objects, which can be recalled and controlled externally with a certain interfacing code. In MATLAB, user can review the variables that are available for automations or from COM server, where all variables and type of each variable are listed. Moreover, user can reach the design variable or parameter by more than one way to select the easiest way to transfer the data directly from HYSYS to MATLAB and vice versa. The framework directly links to key parameters and looks live and interactive, in contrast to linking to a spreadsheet, as has been done in most previous endeavors. It is important to note that if information is sent to HYSYS from a client application, HYSYS does not return control to the calling program until calculations are complete [41]. All simulation runs and executed algorithms were performed by using a computer with a 2.10 GHzi3-2310\u00a0M processor and 3\u00a0GB of RAM.\n\n\nOptimization algorithms\nThe most important step in the optimization process is to select a tailored algorithm that fits the problem to be optimized. In general, optimization algorithms are classified into two broad categories: gradient-based algorithms and algorithms that employ derivative-free optimization. When using the gradient-based algorithms, the only way to obtain the derivative information from HYSYS is to make a disturbance for the design variables. Fig. 3\n shows a numerical experiment to clarify how the information is transferred from HYSYS to MATLAB and vice versa. The accuracy of the transferred data is of paramount importance for optimization.\nHYSYS-Optimizer only employs some gradient-based algorithms that need convex models to ensure local optima. On the other hand, MATLAB has both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization approaches. In HYSYS, small numerical noise usually arises when the initial values of the variables change and then recover. This numerical noise is large enough to prevent the calculation of accurate derivatives. This effect results in gradient-based optimization algorithms or finite difference methods that exist in MATLAB or in HYSYS itself being unreliable [42]. To minimize this numerical noise, the tolerance values should be less than 10-6. However, these tolerance values make convergence of the flow sheet very difficult, especially when treating interrelated systems such as recycle streams. On the other hand, algorithms that employ stochastic optimization techniques provide an attractive option for optimization since these methods are derived from heuristics that depend on derivative-free optimization techniques. This means that the information can be transferred from\/to HYSYS through a perturbation mechanism by making a disturbance to the design variables instead of derivative information. Therefore, these algorithms avoid the difficulties of the high level of numerical noise that is produced from deterministic techniques [43,44]. In this work, Global Optimization Toolbox, a built-in MATLAB tool, was used to provide methods of optimization. Both GA [45] and PSO [46,47] were selected for comparison.\nThe GA uses the principle of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d in its search process to select and generate individuals (design solutions) that are adapted to their (design objectives\/constraints). The GA will then apply one of three stochastic operators to each point in the population. It will either keep a point for the next generation (selection), combine two points to obtain a new point (crossover), or randomly perturb a candidate solution by changing the point completely (mutation) [45]. On the other hand, the GA shows poor performance.in highly constrained systems.\nPSO is a relatively novel stochastic technique. This technique mimics the way a swarm of birds (particles) locates a best landing place applies the social interaction behavior of fish schooling or bird flocking [46].Each particle is treated as a particle in N-dimensional space that adjusts its \u201cflying\u201d according to its own flying experience as well as the flying experience of other particles [47].\nThe default number of generations in MATLAB for the GA is (100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0number of variables)to guarantee the minimum objective function value [48]. Therefore, there is no need to re-execute the algorithm to guarantee the same solution. However, the GA needs some kind of sensitivity analysis after implementation with different initial values to guarantee the fittest solution. As shown in Fig. 4\nA, the algorithm starts by the converged steady-state simulation model, and then the objective function is evaluated for different design variables and design parameters to determine the best design variables. All newly populated design variables are reverted to evaluate objective function again for the next generation. This process is repeated until the stopping criterion is satisfied.\nOn the other hand, in PSO, the number of particles in the swarm (swarm size) is the minimum of 100 or (10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0number of variables) to guarantee the minimum objective function value [49]. Due to the random population of design variables, convergence to the same solution is not always guaranteed in the case of PSO. Thus, the algorithm is executed a certain number of times to assess the convergence of the proposed optimization approach and check to what extent the values are close to each other. As shown in Fig. 4B, the algorithm starts by the converged steady- state simulation model, and then the objective function is evaluated for different design variables and design parameters to determine the best design variables. All newly populated particles are reverted into the PSO as the next generation. This process is repeated until the stopping criterion is satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nDebutanizer\nSince the optimum operating conditions are absent in the beginning of the design, the number of stages of the debutanizer against the total duty has been explored at different split ratios by changing the operating tower pressure (Fig. 5\nA). The lower number of trays reflects a lower capital cost, but at the expense of the operating cost.\nIn the old design of the debutanizer, the number of stages was chosen closer to the focus point of the hyperbola (21 theoretical stages excluding the reboiler and condenser). However, the price of energy and its fluctuations greatly influence the optimum number of stages. Therefore, it is currently recommended to presume higher energy cost during the design phase to accommodate the fluctuations in the price of energy [39]. As shown in Fig. 5A, the curve flattens at approximately 25 theoretical stages (excluding the reboiler and condenser). Consequently, a smarter choice for the optimum number of stages for the debutanizer would be around this value to increase the flexibility of the operation.\nThe optimum feed location of the debutanizer should be selected based on the lowest total duty for the selected number of stages. In addition, the optimum feed location should be feeding to a tray with a similar composition to minimize the composition gradient between the feed and tray and consequently reduce the total duty. Hence, evaluating the feed location is an essential step for successful distillation unit optimization. Fig. 5B shows that the optimum feed location is around the 11th stage for the selected total number of stages.\n\n\nDeethanizer\nAs mentioned before, the deethanizer tower consists of an absorber rectifying section and a conventional distillation stripping section. Since the duty of the reboiler is supplied by the hot stream of stabilized naphtha, the operating cost is a function of only the cooling duty of the condenser. A change in the number of stages of the deethanizer has a minor effect on the cooling duty of the condenser, although this effect decreases with increasing the number of stages (Fig. 6\nA). As per common practice, the absorber tray efficiencies run notoriously low. Therefore, the number of stages has to be selected carefully not to violate the maximum allowable equipment shipping length (35\u00a0m), while maintaining moderate duty and tuned temperature profile along the tower. As shown in Fig. 6A, the optimum is approximately 10\u201311 theoretical stages, which does not exceed the maximum length.\n\n\nLean oil\nThe amount of recycled lean oil has a great impact on the operating pressure of the towers and the total duties. Table 1\n (A and B) shows the effect of the split ratio for the base case and future mode, respectively.\nThe operating pressure of the deethanizer in the future mode increases notably more than that in the base case (Fig. 6B). The feed mixture in the future mode is lighter than that in the baseline scenario. Accordingly, the vapor pressure of the overhead stream is higher. Therefore, to keep the constraint of the lowest overhead temperature of 43\u00a0\u00b0C, the operating pressure of the tower was increased. Similarly, the bottom temperature of the deethanizer tower notably increases with decreasing split ratio due to the increased operating pressure of the tower.\nAs for the debutanizer, its pressure should be compromised. The increase in the operating pressure of the debutanizer leads to violating the constraint of C4 specification. On the other hand, decreasing the operating pressure of the debutanizer decreases the bottom temperature of the debutanizer, and which this effect leads to the absence of thermal integration between the deethanizer and debutanizer reboilers.\nFinally, at higher split ratios, the total duty and the area of condensers are higher. Thus, CAPEX and OPEX increase dramatically. Consequently, very high split ratios are excluded from upper bounds to reduce the execution time of the optimization algorithm. Similarly, much lower split ratios are also excluded for two reasons. First, an additional operating cost is needed due to utilizing high-pressure steam in each reboiler of the deethanizer and debutanizer. Second, heat integration for the feed preheater could not happen in the case of increasing the pressure of the deethanizer above a certain value or decreasing the pressure of the debutanizer under a certain value.\n\n\nConstrained bounds for the base case and future mode\nAccording to the implemented sensitivity analysis, constrained bounds for each design variable are deduced to be used as inputs for the optimization. Since the split ratio is the most effective design variable that affects the recovery of LPG and the other design parameters, a wider range was used. Table 2\n shows the bounds used for the base case and future mode, respectively.\n\n\n\nOptimization\n\nOutputs of the GA\nThe initial values affect the results of the GA to a great extent. Therefore, these values should be selected based on a real understanding of the system and the objective function. If the selected initial values are very far from the optimum point, the whole algorithm will fail and produce infeasible solutions for the objective function. These infeasible solutions arise because the flow sheet does not converge at all points within the constraint bounds of the design variables through the objective function correlation. Nevertheless, the GA has the ability to move away from the infeasible regions and keep searching for the minimum real value as long as the initial values produce a feasible value in the initialization step.\n\nTable 3\n represents the outputs from the GA optimization including the optimum design values of the variables, the optimum objective function and the CPU times for the base case and future mode. Unlike the baseline scenario, the future mode suffered from instability issues. Due to this instability, the deethanizer was resettled at each generation of the design variables to guarantee convergence for the whole flow sheet. However, the CPU time increased tremendously.\n\n\nOutputs of PSO\nIn some meta-heuristic algorithms such as PSO, there are two methods to guarantee producing feasible solutions of the whole algorithm and avoid any deviation from feasible regions. One of these methods is accompanying the algorithm with penalty functions, in which external constraints are placed into the objective function via penalty parameters to penalize any violation, in addition to broadening the ranges of the bound constraints for the design variables. However, due to the large number of constraints encountered in the optimization, it is advisable to avoid adding any penalty terms in the objective function to facilitate the problem and guarantee the robustness of the solution [50]. To remedy this problem without the adoption of penalty strategies, the constrained bounds were divided here to more than one interval. Each interval contained the constrained bounds that guaranteed the convergence of the simulator in the whole interval without deviation. The division of the intervals was determined by checking whether the objective function is valid by using the option \u201cFunValCheck\u201d in the syntax to stop the algorithm and display an error when the objective function returns a value that is infeasible and then identify the new interval. Thus, this second method depends on some intervention from the user to facilitate convergence and guarantee the feasibility of the solution. Moreover, in the PSO algorithm, the small variations that exist between the values of the objective function are usually a consequence of small numerical noise from the process simulator. Therefore, five consecutive executions were produced to determine the optimum operating conditions and are considered enough, especially since the design variables here are continuous, not discrete.\nFor the base case, the constrained bounds were divided into two intervals as shown in Table 4\n. For each interval, the results of five consecutive executions of the optimization algorithm coupled with CPU time and the minimum TAC are included. The lowest TAC is considered the best minimum for the whole range from PSO for the base case and is similar in value to that obtained previously from the GA optimization.\nFor the future mode, due to the instability, the intervals of constrained bounds were divided into three intervals as shown in Table 5\n. For each interval, the results of 5 consecutive executions of the optimization algorithm coupled with CPU time and the minimum TAC are included. The lowest TAC is considered the best minimum for the whole range from PSO for the future mode and is similar in value to that obtained previously from the GA optimization.\nFrom the above tables, both the GA and PSO reached nearly the same best optimum for the base case and future case of 826,000 and 1,118,000 USD\/year, respectively. In addition, the final produced optimum design variables from each algorithm are nearly the same. For the base case, the optimum operating pressure of the deethanizer, the optimum operating pressure of the debutanizer and the recycled stabilized naphtha were 0.85\u00a0MPa, 0.50\u00a0MPa and 3.2\u00a0kg\/s, respectively. For the future mode, the optimum operating pressure of the deethanizer, the optimum operating pressure of the debutanizer, and the recycled stabilized naphtha were 0.87\u00a0MPa, 0.55\u00a0MPa and 10\u00a0kg\/s, respectively. For ease of tower operation, the internal temperature profile along the distillation towers should be tuned according to the optimum operating conditions to align with the normal temperature profile.\nThe time taken by PSO in both of the base case and future mode (1500\u00a0s and 9850\u00a0s, respectively) was less than that taken by the GA in both the base case and future mode (25610\u00a0s and 40951\u00a0s, respectively). However, PSO needs more understanding of the system. This need is reflected in the intervals of the constrained bounds chosen to avoid using any additive penalty function terms in the objective function. On the other hand, the GA provides the best optimum within a wider range of bound constraints, as long as good intuition about the initial point is given to the algorithm. Finally, it is clear from the above that both the GA and PSO can be used as \u201cfit-for-purpose\u201d optimization algorithms according to the nature of the optimization problem.\nThe implemented strategy adopted in the current work shows how to optimize more complex systems and\/or entire green- or brown-field plants. These systems require more constraints, design variables, and design parameters to couple the simulator with MATLAB in a rational and seamless way. The strategy sheds light on how to deal with alternative stochastic algorithms, i.e., the GA and PSO, in such a wide range of conditions. Moreover, this optimization-simulation strategy can be generalized to be used in dynamic simulations to optimize control parameters. Finally, the strategy can be very beneficial for brownfields to optimize the operating conditions, particularly, for CDUs and vacuum distillation units, which require periodic tuning to optimize operating conditions due to the continuous changes in the feedstock conditions.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nA coupling between Aspen HYSYS and MATLAB to produce a precise steady state simulation-based optimization strategy was developed through a real case study. The coupling was demonstrated in optimization of a complex SGP in a certain refinery plant in Egypt to maximize the benefit from the produced off-gases. A merge between sensitivity analysis and stochastic optimization techniques such as GA and PSO was adopted in the optimization strategy. The implemented strategy reached the best operating conditions by minimizing the total annual cost while maintaining at least 92% butane recovery as a process guarantee for the whole plant.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed in detail. The elapsed time needed by PSO was less than that needed by the GA, but PSO needed more understanding of the system in terms of the well-defined bounds. This difference was reflected in the constrained bounds chosen to avoid using any additive penalty function terms in the objective function. Despite the large amount of time needed, the GA provides greater confidence than PSO in optimization with wider ranges of constrained bounds. In any case, both methods are fit-for-purpose algorithms.\nThe results show that the implemented strategy can provide viable and reliable operating conditions. This finding is reflected in obtaining essentially the same best conditions whether by using the GA or PSO within the bounds implemented for both algorithms. For ease of tower operation, the internal temperature profile along the distillation towers should be finally tuned corresponding to the best operating conditions to align with the normal temperature profile. The optimization-simulation strategy can be used in brownfields to optimize the operating conditions, which may be susceptible to continuous changes in feedstock conditions.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","60":"\n\nIntroduction\nDue to the low abundance of biomolecules in human serum and the difficulty of directly detecting these biomolecules, efforts have been made over many years to find suitable strategies for signal amplification. In recent years, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has been applied to signal amplification [1\u20134], due to its well-controlled reaction rate, the availability of a wide range of monomers and its simplicity of operation. Recently, research into ATRP has focused on its environmental impacts. The ligands and transition metals used are harmful to both human beings and the environment. There are various metal ligands of ATRP, including poly (ethylene imine), and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032\u2032,N\u2032\u2032-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) [5\u20137], tris (2-(dimethylamino)ethyl) amine (Me6TREN) [8\u201310] and so on. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a chelating agent [11], is cost-effective, and has stable performance and low toxicity. EDTA can form stable water-soluble complexes with alkali metals, rare earth elements, and transition metals [12]. EDTA, as a multidentate ligand containing more than two coordination atoms can form a metal complex with metal ions. The complexes formed by EDTA and most metal ions have the characteristics of high stability, a simple coordination ratio (generally 1:1), rapid coordination reaction, and good water solubility. Therefore, EDTA has considerable practical value. In recent years, the application of complexes in molecular detection has attracted great attention. The FeCl2\/EDTA-system has been studied as an ATRP mediator [13,14].\nThe regulation of ATRP involves activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET-ATRP) [15\u201317], photo ATRP [18,19] and mechano ATRP [20,21]. As a number of the ATRP family, ARGET-ATRP requires low concentrations of transition catalysts, and can react under low oxygen conditions, due to the excess of reducing agent [22\u201324]. ARGET-ATRP has been gradually used in the fields of industry, biology, pharmacy, and environmental science [22,25]. ARGET-ATRP can establish a reversible dynamic equilibrium between Cu (II), the dormant species, and Cu (I) the active species, by a reducing agent, with a large amount of monomer repeatedly added to achieve polymerization [26,27]. Previous researchers have reported the use of ARGET-ATRP as an amplification technique for achieving ultrasensitive detection of biomolecules. Cheng et al. had reported synthesis of a surface-active ATRP initiator, and its use in ARGET-ATRP polymerisation [17].\nIn this paper, we report the development of an ultrasensitive fluorescent CYFRA21-1 DNA detection for the early diagnosis of lung cancer based on ARGET-ATRP with EDTA as the metal ligand. CYFRA21-1 DNA is considered as the most important biomarker of the diagnosis of non-small cells (NSCLC), which is commonly used as the tDNA to diagnosis NSCLC. Thiolated peptide nucleic acid (PNA) was modified on the surface of the MBs by a cross-linking agent. Next, CYFRA21-1 segments were specifically identified using PNA. After hybridization between PNA and tDNA, \u03b1-bromophenylacetic acid (BPAA), the initiator of ARGET-ATRP, was linked to the PNA\/DNA heteroduplexes via bridges of phosphate-Zr4+-carboxylate chemistry. Subsequently, EDTA was used as the metal ligand of Cu(II), and Cu(II)Br\/EDTA was formed. Ascorbic acid (AA), as the catalyst of ARGET-ATRP reduced Cu(II)Br\/EDTA to Cu(I)\/EDTA for activating polymerization, and numerous monomers (fluorescein-o-acrylate) were introduced to the surface of the MBs. This strategy produced a strong linear relationship between the fluorescence signal and the logarithm of tDNA concentrations between 0.1 fM and 1\u00a0nM, with a low detection limit. This strategy has excellent stability, cost-effectiveness, selectivity, and outstanding anti-interference properties. This signal amplification strategy based on ARGET-ATRP with EDTA as the metal ligand was firstly reported in the field of sensing analysis.\n\n\nExperimental section\n\nMaterials and reagents\nAll chemicals and reagents were analytical grade, and ultrapure water was used in all experiments.

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) was obtained from Beijing Solarbio Science&Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Ascorbic acid (AA), 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester sodium salt (sulfo-SMCC), and zirconium dichloride oxide octahydrate (ZrOCl2) were obtained from J&K Scientific Ltd. (Beijing, China). Fluorescein-o-acrylate (FA) and \u03b1-bromophenylacetic acid (BPAA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and copper (II) bromide (CuBr2) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Sodium hydroxide, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride and disodium hydrogen phosphate were obtained from Tianjin Kemeo Chemical Test Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Normal human serum (NHS) was produced by Shanghai YiJi Industrial Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Sangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). As shown in Table 1\n, the sequences of oligonucleotides were displayed.\nPhosphate buffer saline (PBS butter, 0.1\u00a0M, pH 7.4) was used for diluting and washing oligonucleotides, and the solvent for the fluorescence detection was prepared using 0.1\u00a0M PBS butter.\n\n\nApparatus\nAll modifications of MBs were carried out on a constant temperature shaker (St. Louis, USA). The atomic force microscope (AFM) images were obtained from Dimension Icon (Bruker, USA). Fluorescent measurements were recorded using an Edinburgh FLS-1000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh, UK). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with Sigma HD field emission SEM (Zeiss, Germany).\n\n\nPNA functionalization of MBs\nPrior to use, 20\u00a0\u03bcL of MBs were washed three times, and then PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M, 180\u00a0\u03bcL) was added to resuspend the MBs in a centrifuge tube. Subsequently, sulfo-SMCC (0.5\u00a0mM, 20\u00a0\u03bcL) were added to the centrifuge tubes respectively and mixed completely, and the reaction was carried out at 310\u00a0K for 2\u00a0h in a constant temperature shaker.\nAfter washing with PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M) the mixture was magnetically separated. The MBs were distributed in PNA (0.5\u00a0\u03bcM, 5\u00a0\u03bcL) and PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M, 195\u00a0\u03bcL), and the reaction solution was placed in the constant temperature shaker at 310\u00a0K overnight.\n\n\nModification of sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/DNA\/Zr4+-modified MBs\nAfter washing and magnetically separation in PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M), tDNA (0.1\u00a0nM, 20\u00a0\u03bcL) and PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M, 180\u00a0\u03bcL) were added to the centrifuge tube respectively and mixed completely. Afterwards, the reaction was incubated for two hours at 310\u00a0K in the constant temperature shaker. Subsequently, the MBs were washed with PBS butter (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M), the MBs were reacted with Zr4+ (0.5\u00a0mM, 20\u00a0\u03bcL) and PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M, 180\u00a0\u03bcL). After then, the reacting system was placed in the constant temperature shaker for 0.5\u00a0h at 310\u00a0K. Finally, the sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/DNA\/Zr4+-modified MBs were formed.\n\n\nCuBr2\/EDTA-mediated ARGET-ATRP\nTo produce the initiator-modified MBs, the sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/DNA\/Zr4+-modified MBs were washed and magnetically separated in PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M). Next, BPAA (1\u00a0mM, 20\u00a0\u03bcL) and PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M, 180\u00a0\u03bcL) were added to the reaction system at 310\u00a0K for 1\u00a0h. The sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/DNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA-modified MBs were obtained. This ARGET-ATRP mixture was obtained by adding FA (10\u00a0mM, 10\u00a0\u00b5L), AA (2\u00a0mM, 20\u00a0\u00b5L), and Cu(II)Br\/EDTA (10\u00a0mM, 20\u00a0\u00b5L, 1:1.2 in molarity dissolved in DMF) into PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M, 150\u00a0\u03bcL). Then the ARGET-ATRP mixture was added to the reacting system and placed in a constant temperature shaker at 310\u00a0K for 2\u00a0h to obtain the sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/DNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA\/FA-modified MBs.\n\n\nFluorescent detection of CYFRA21-1 DNA\nThe sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/DNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA\/FA-modified MBs from ARGET-ATRP were washed with DMF, and PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M) in succession, and magnetically separated. Finally, the fluorescence intensity was measured by adding sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/DNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA\/FA-modified MBs sample into 700\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M). The fluorescent signals were amplified using a fluorospectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 489\u00a0nm, and a slit width of 2\u00a0nm.\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nPrinciple of the fluorescence sensor via CuBr2\/EDTA-mediated ATRP\nThe process of construction of this ultrasensitive fluorescence sensor based on ARGET-ATRP with EDTA as the metal ligand was showed in Fig. 1\n. During this process, first of all, PNA capture probes were immobilized on the surface of MBs with sulfo-SMCC. The carbonyl group of the sulfo-SMCC was connected with the MBs-NH2 to link the sulfo-SMCC to the surface of the MBs. The double bond at the other end of the sulfo-SMCC reacted with the sulfydryl group of PNA by an addition reaction, and a PNA probe was modified to the surface of MBs. PNA can hybridize with tDNA to form PNA\/DNA heteroduplexes through specifically identifying between PNA and tDNA. Subsequently, under the coordination of Zr4+, the phosphate groups of tDNA and the carboxy group of the initiator (BPAA) were coordinated with Zr4+ to form sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/tDNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA-modified MBs.\nAt the beginning of ARGET-ATRP, Cu(II)Br\/EDTA was reduced to Cu(I)\/EDTA by AA, and AA was oxidated to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The Br\u2212 of BPAA was seized by Cu(I)\/EDTA while Cu(II)Br\/EDTA was produced due to the transfer of Br from BPAA to Cu(I)\/EDTA, and free radical (P\u2022) was generated. The regenerated Cu(II)Br\/EDTA was again reduced to Cu(I)\/EDTA by excessive AA, and P\u2022 continuously attacked the carbon-carbon double bond of the monomer (FA), and polymer chains were formed.\nIn this study, EDTA was used as the ligand of Cu(II) to form strong complexs with Cu(I) and Cu(II). EDTA is widely used as multidentate ligand [28,29], due to it being a reagent with N and O complexing points. It exists as a double dipole ion structure in aqueous solution, so when the concentration of OH\u2212 increased, the H+ decreased and the concentration of (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid root) Y4\u2212 increased in EDTA aqueous solution. Because of each N atom of EDTA had two lone pair electrons, each of the O atoms had two lone pair electrons when Y4\u2212 was at higher concentration in EDTA aqueous solution. The concentration of OH\u2212 is greater than H+ in aqueous solution, Y4\u2212 was the most abundant ion species in the aqueous solutions. Thus, Y4\u2212 had six coordination atoms when the aqueous solution was alkaline. In the ARGET-ATRP system, Cu(II)Br with EDTA formed (Cu(II)Br\/EDTA) complexes, which formed Cu(I)\/EDTA, under the action of the reducing agent AA. Because PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M) was used in all experiments, the stability of the Cu(II)Br\/EDTA and Cu(I)\/EDTA complexes was not affected, and the growth of the polymeric chains was stable.\n\n\nFeasibility of the fluorescence biosensor\nIn order to explore the feasibility of this ultrasensitive DNA fluorescent detection via ARGET-ATRP with EDTA as the metal ligand, we compared the fluorescence intensity of the MBs that were modified with different materials. As shown in the Fig. 2\n, the fluorescence signal near zero when the PBS buffer (curve a) was detected, the result shown that the fluorescence signal of modified MBs was not affected by adding PBS buffer. The proposed sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/tDNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA\/FA-modified MBs (curve g) generated the strongest fluorescence intensity at 512\u00a0nm. Under other conditions (in the absence of PNA, tDNA, Zr4+, BPAA, or FA, respectively), the fluorescence signal was particularly weak. In the absence of FA (curve b), the fluorescence intensity was almost zero. This could be because FA could not be introduced to MBs utilizing ARGET-ATRP, so the fluorescent signal was not successfully amplified. The fluorescence intensity was also very low when the BPAA initiator (curve f) was not added, due to the lack of free radicals. In addition, very weak fluorescence intensities were observed without PNA (curve c), tDNA (curve d) or Zr4+ (curve e), because the polymer resulting from the ARGET-ATRP reaction could not be connected to the surface of the MBs. These experiments clearly demonstrated the importance of PNA and DNA complementary pairing, and also illustrated that the strategy had a high signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratio and showed high sensitivity for tDNA. Therefore, the experimental results indicated that the amplified signal produced by a strategy based on ARGET-ATRP with EDTA as the metal ligand could be applied to the detection of CYFRA21-1 of lung cancer.\n\n\nCharacterization of MBs modification\nAFM was used to verify the surface morphology of the modified MBs. Fig. 3\n showed that the height of the sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/tDNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA\/FA-modified MBs was 32.4\u00a0nm, while the sulfo-SMCC\/PNA-modified MBs showed a maximum height of 9.3\u00a0nm. By contrast the height of different modified MBs, we found the sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/tDNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA\/FA and sulfo-SMCC\/PNA-modified MBs had a dramatic change of height. The reason for this result might be that the monomer (FA) was aggregated on the surface of MBs via ARGET-ATRP. However, if tDNA was absent from the system, the phosphate-Zr4+-carboxylate chemistry was disabled leading to unsuccessful polymerization. As displayed in Fig. 4\n(A,B), SEM investigation revealed that the sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/tDNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA\/FA-modified MBs (Fig. 4A) had a relatively rough surface compared with that of the control group without tDNA (Fig. 4B), and floccule was observed on the surface of the functional MBs. Those results suggested that this signal amplification strategy using the CuBr2\/EDTA-system as an ATRP mediator was feasible.\nTo further characterize the biosensor, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was applied to observe the elements on the surface of the MBs for qualitative analysis. Different elements possesses different frequency of characteristic X-rays [30,31]. Therefore, the different elements appear in different colors when EDS was used to scan the surface of a sample with an electron beam. As shown in Fig. 4(C-F), the EDS images of the MBs showed that the characteristic element composition was S (Fig. 4C) P, (Fig. 4D), Zr (Fig. 4E), and Br (Fig. 4F). The S element exists in PNA, hence, the results showed that PNA was present on the surface of the MBs. The P element in EDS images was shown because of the phosphate groups of tDNA, indicating that tDNA was successfully attached to the surface of the MBs by the PNA capture probe. The presence of Zr and Br element indicated that ZrOCl2 and BPAA were successfully attached to the surface of the MBs via phosphate-Zr4+-carboxylate chemistry. From these results, we could see that the ultrasensitive fluorescence sensor using the CuBr2\/EDTA-system as an ATRP mediator was successfully constructed.\n\n\nOptimization of ARGET-ATRP conditions\nIn order to achieve ultrasensitive analysis of CYFRA21-1 via fluorescence sensors, various conditions of detection of ARGET-ATRP most be taken into account, including the reaction time of AGTE-ATRP and the amount of FA. The growth of ARGET-ATRP polymeric chains was correlated with the coupling time of probes onto the MBs surface. Therefore, the relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the reaction time of AGTE-ATRP was investigated. As shown in Fig. S1A, with increasing time, the fluorescence intensity rapidly increased from 10\u00a0min to 100\u00a0min, after which the fluorescence intensity reached a plateau. Presumably, the growth of the polymer chain was terminated, which might be because the reaction had reached equilibrium. Hence, the ideal reaction time of ARGET-ATRP for the subsequent experiments was set to 100\u00a0min.\nIn this method, the amount of fluorescence monomer (FA) introduced into the MBs affected the length of the ARGET-ATRP chain. In Fig. S1B, it clearly showed that the fluorescence signal intensity did not increase until the volume of FA was more than 10\u00a0\u03bcL, which could indicate that the reaction of ARGET-ATRP had stopped. To further improve the cost-effectiveness of the fluorescence sensors, the optimal amount of FA was determined to be 10\u00a0\u03bcL, an amount that was used in the subsequent experiments.\n\n\nAnalytical performance for CYFRA21-1 DNA detection\nUnder the optimum experimental conditions, in order to explore the analytical performance of the fluorescence CYFRA21-1 DNA biosensor based on the ARGET-ATRP signal amplification strategy, we investigated the relationship between fluorescence intensity and various concentrations of tDNA. As shown in Fig. 5\nA, the fluorescence absorption was strongest at 512\u00a0nm. The fluorescence intensity gradually increased with the increase of the concentration of tDNA in the range of 0.1 fM to 1\u00a0nM. As shown in Fig. 5B, the liner regression equation was F(au)\u00a0=\u00a05108.56 lgCtDNA\n\u00a0+\u00a041197.29, with a correlation coefficient (R2\n) of 0.9988, and the detection limit (LOD) of this method was calculated to be 23.8 aM based on the S\/N\u00a0=\u00a03. To further demonstrate the excellent performance of the fluorescence biosensor, as summarized in Table 2\n, we compared the linear range and LOD of this strategy to that of other sensors. This method improved the detection sensitivity of the fluorescence DNA biosensor by taking advantage of specific recognition of PNA probes and ATRP amplification. This strategy also had the advantages of low cost and simple operation.\n\n\nSelectivity, stability, and anti-interference ability\nSelectivity and stability are important parameters for evaluating the performance of this biosensor. In order to demonstrate the selectivity of the fluorescence DNA biosensor, we tested and compared the fluorescence intensity of 0.1\u00a0nM tDNA with that of 0.1\u00a0nM SBM, TBM, and Control under the same conditions. In Fig. 6\nA, it could be seen that the fluorescence intensity of the Control, TBM, and SBM were respectively 93.69%, 83.46%, and 80.82% lower than that of tDNA. The mismatched base(s) of those oligonucleotides were unfavorable for the forming of PNA\/DNA heteroduplexes, which led to the reduction of phosphate and thus the reduction of ATRP initiator. The amount of monomers dramatically decreased, therefore the fluorescence intensity of the Control, TBM, and SBM decreased. These results demonstrated that the DNA fluorescence detection system was able to specifically detect DNA, and the fluorescence biosensor had high selectivity for DNA.\nThe stability of this fluorescence biosensor was demonstrated by testing the fluorescence intensity of sulfo-SMCC\/PNA\/tDNA\/Zr4+\/BPAA\/FA-modified MBs. Under the same experimental conditions, the MBs samples were stored for two weeks at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, then the samples were uniformly mixed. The fluorescence intensity of the MBs showed no significant change. Therefore, the results indicated that the DNA fluorescence biosensor had satisfactory stability.\nIn order to evaluate the anti-interference ability of this fluorescence DNA biosensor in normal human serum, the fluorescence intensity in 0.1 fM, 0.1\u00a0pM, and 0.1\u00a0nM tDNA in 5% NHS were compared with those in PBS buffer. As shown in Fig. 6B, the fluorescence intensity of 0.1 fM, 0.1\u00a0pM and 0.1\u00a0nM tDNA in 5% NHS were approximately 91.99%, 90.87%, and 97.15% of those from PBS butter (pH 7.4, 0.1\u00a0M), respectively. Hence, the fluorescence biosensor based on the ARGET-ATRP signal amplification strategy had an excellent anti-interference ability in NHS and had a good potential for application potential in a clinical setting.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have reported an ultrasensitive fluorescence biosensor based on ARGET-ATRP signal amplification with EDTA as the metal ligand, and applied it to the detection of CYFRA21-1 of lung cancer for the first time. Under optimum reaction conditions, this fluorescence biosensor shows a good analytical performance, with a linear range of 0.1 fM to 1\u00a0nM, and a detection limit is as low as 23.8 aM. The most important reason for this performance is that the method exhibited displays high anti-interference ability in capability NHS. However, it has some deficiencies that need to be further improved. For example, optimization of the total assay time for biosensor applications would be valuable. In summary, because of the fluorescence sensor's low cost, good selectivity, excellent anti-interference capability, high stability, and good sensitivity, the fluorescence sensor showed great promise for the detection of clinically important entities, such as those involved in cancer.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","61":"\n\nIntroduction\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is a common form of gastrointestinal cancer, and millions of new cases are diagnosed worldwide every year [1,2]. CRC develops slowly through the progressive accumulation of genetic mutations and aberrations in DNA [3]. Despite advances in therapy for CRC patients, 20\u201345% of those who undergo curative resection subsequently develop tumor relapse or distant metastasis [4,5]. Further, CRC relapse correlates strongly with poor prognosis [4,6,7].\nGenes regulating cell growth and differentiation are frequently altered in the process of tumorigenesis in cancerous cells [8]. Patients are increasingly being selected for additional treatment on an individual basis, requiring the identification of indicator molecules whose appearance or activity correlates with CRC relapse or progression [4,9]. Various clinical characteristics and serum markers have recently been identified as risk factors, which can be used to evaluate postoperative relapse and poor prognosis of CRC [10].\nSome genes found in human stool samples have been associated with CRC and show molecular significance for cancer biology and molecular medicine [11]. Likewise, molecules involved in tumor progression have been found in the stool of CRC patients [12]. Among those genes, Growth Arrest Specific 2 (GAS2, NM_005256) seems to be upregulated in the stool of patients who have relapsed CRC, and its expression has been shown to be affected by targeted chemotherapy [13]. Another gene that might be implicated in tumor progression is Placenta Specific 8 (PLAC8, NM_001130715), which has been reported to participate in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC [14].\nIt is thought that some gut microorganisms may affect gene expression in colon cells and possibly the fate of CRC [15,16]. Gut microflora-related mechanisms involved in CRC progression have been identified as new targets for understanding CRC [17,18]. Bacterial dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal tract may induce different molecular mechanisms, which could potentiate development or progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms [19]. In addition, metabolites of gut microflora are associated with the inflammatory response. For example, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, can suppress inflammation and tumorigenesis in the gastrointestinal tract [19,20].\nAccumulation of aberrant genes may lead to CRC or its progression. Such anomalous genes found in stool, as well as the role of the gut microbiome in CRC development or progression, should be evaluated to determine whether they have clinical relevance [17,19]. We hypothesised that gene expression and gut microflora found in stool may differ between healthy people and patients with CRC, and that this difference may reflect CRC severity. Identifying specific metabolites and\/or aberrant human gene expression found in stool may help in devising strategies for the prevention, screening, detection, and treatment of CRC.\nIn this study, we sought to further understand the role of PLAC8 in CRC progression and its clinical significance. We used both cell and animal models to clarify the role of PLAC8 gene and protein expression in CRC invasion, migration, and progression [13]. We immuno-stained tumor sections to evaluate PLAC8 protein expression in tissues from patients with different stages of CRC. Considering the relationship between inflammation and CRC progression, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to globally screen for 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in stool samples from patients [16]. To better understand the interactions between gut microflora and colon cells, we examined a metabolite of the gut microflora to determine whether its concentration correlated with the expression of PLAC8 in CRC cells.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy participants and animals\nColon tissue sections were obtained from four patients (one non-CRC and three CRC) from Taipei Veterans General Hospital and were used for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Twenty-five stool samples were obtained from Cathay General Hospital and were used for NGS of 16S rDNA to study the gut microbiome. The initial tumor stages of these patients were characterized, and three non-CRC controls underwent a colonoscopy examination (Supplementary Table S1). Briefly, the inclusion criteria for enrolled patients were: adult (>20\u00a0years old) CRC patients with known AJCC stage, with known clinical characteristics (such as treatment, whether combined with other diseases, smoking or not, and drinking or not), but without diarrhea. The stool samples were presurgically sampled, preserved by snap-freezing, and randomly divided into two groups: a testing group [n\u00a0=\u00a019: three non-CRC controls, three patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I disease, three with stage II, and ten with stage III\/IV (eight were stage III and two were stage IV)]; and a validation group (n\u00a0=\u00a06: two patients with AJCC stage 0 disease, two with stage II, and two with stage III).\nIn addition, cDNA arrays of colonic tissues covering four CRC stages (HCRT104; OriGene Technologies) were purchased for quantification of PLAC8 expression. To examine whether PLAC8 has a tumorigenic effect in vivo, a xenograft model was initiated in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Ten male SCID mice (CB17\/Icr-Prkdcscid\n\/IcrIcoCrlBltw) purchased from BioLasco Taiwan Co., Ltd (Taipei, Taiwan) were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in an individually ventilated cage rack system (Tecniplast, Varese, Italy) in the Animal Research Center of the Cathay Medical Research Institute, Cathay General Hospital.\n\n\n16S metagenomics studies using 16S rDNA NGS\nExtraction of bacterial DNA from stools was performed according to the protocol in the EasyPrep Stool Genomic DNA kit (Biotools Co., New Taipei, Taiwan). Briefly, an aliquot of stool sample weighing 0.2\u00a0g was used. The final extraction resulted in 200\u00a0\u03bcL of DNA solution, as quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). We used the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to analyze 16S rDNA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The sequences of the variable V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA were used for phylogenetic classification, such as genus or species, in diverse microbial populations [21]. These 250-bp paired-end raw reads derived from the 16S ribosomal amplicon sequencing were assembled using FLASH v.1.2.7 [22]. Bioinformatic analysis was performed for demultiplexing based on barcode identification. As a quality control, reads with a Q score less than the threshold (Q\u00a0<\u00a020) were discarded in the QIIME 1.7 pipeline [23]. If the quality of three consecutive bases failed to meet the threshold, a truncated read was generated and retained in the data set only if it was \u226575% of the original length [24]. Sequences were chimera-checked using UCHIME to obtain effective tags [25,26] and filtered from the data set before operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering at 97% sequence identity using the UPARSE function in the USEARCH v. 7 pipeline [27,28].\nFor each representative sequence, the RDP classifier (v. 2.2) algorithm was used to annotate the taxonomic classification based on the information retrieved from the Greengenes database (v. 13_8) [29,30]. Sequences with a one-time occurrence (singletons) or that were present in only one sample were filtered out. To analyze the sequence similarities in different OTUs, multiple sequence alignment was conducted using the PyNAST software (v. 1.2) against the core-set dataset in the Greengenes database [31]. In addition, abundance information of OTUs was rarefied to the minimum sequence depth to normalize the variations in sequence depth across samples.\nFor multivariate statistical analysis, the significance of all species among groups at various taxonomic levels was tested using Metastats software [32]. To identify the community composition in stool, the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on the normalized OTU table was performed to visualize the complex and multidimensional data [33]. A distance matrix using the unweighted UniFrac distances between samples was transformed into a new set of orthogonal axes, in which the most influential variable was represented by the first principal coordinate, and the second most influential one by the second principal coordinate, etc. PCoA analysis was conducted using the WGCNA, stats, and ggplot2 packages in R.\n\n\nCRC cell lines and gene quantification\nHuman colon cancer cell lines HCT 116 (ATCC CCL-247; AJCC stage II), LS123 (ATCC CCL-255; AJCC stage II), SW480 (ATCC CRL-1459; AJCC stage II), SW620 (ATCC CRL-1831; AJCC stage III), LoVo (ATCC CCL-229; AJCC stage III), and COLO 205 (ATCC CCL-222; AJCC stage IV) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA), and medium suggested for each cell line by the ATCC was used. Primary SW480 cells and lymph node metastatic derivatives (SW620 cells) from the same patient were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in 100% air atmosphere (without CO2) in a humidified incubator.\nThe total RNA of CRC cells was extracted using RNAzol RT (Molecular Research Center) and converted to cDNA with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit in the presence of oligo(dT) primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Gene expression was quantified by qPCR in the presence of specific amplification primers, a TaqMan probe, and TaqMan Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) (Supplementary Table S2) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All mRNA levels were adjusted relative to the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to estimate the relative gene expression. LightCycler Software (version 4.05, Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was used to analyze the PCR kinetics.\n\n\nEvaluation of cell growth and cell migration according to PLAC8 expression\noverPLAC8-SW480 cells were used to assess the effect of PLAC8 on the growth of CRC cells. The relative growth rate was determined by counting cells after different incubation intervals using a Scepter Handheld Automated Cell Counter (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Briefly, cells were counted after different incubation intervals (24, 48, 72\u00a0h), and the cell growth rates were expressed relative to the number at the initial seeding. A cell migration experiment with CRC cells that did or did not overexpress PLAC8 was conducted using a polyethylene terephthalate hanging Transwell insert (diameter, 8\u00a0mm) with a pore size of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm (PIHT12R48; Merck KGaA) according to our previous publication with minor modifications [13]. Briefly, the times for crystal violet staining were 30 and 60\u00a0min for SW480 cells and 20 and 40\u00a0min for SW620 cells. The numbers of migrating cells reported here represent the average value\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation obtained from 2 to 3 independent experiments.\n\n\nPLAC8 knockdown and overexpression in CRC cells\nFor PLAC8 knockdown in SW620 cells, a specific lentivirus-mediated small hairpin (sh) RNA (TRCN0000435105) targeting PLAC8 (shPLAC8; 5\u2032-GAATGTTGTCCCTGAACTTAG-3\u2032) and a control vector (TRCN0000231719) targeting luciferase (shLUC; 5\u2032-GCGGTTGCCAAGAGGTTCCAT-3\u2032) were acquired from the National RNAi Core Facility of Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Infection of each lentivirus into SW620 cells and selection of stable SW620 cells with shPLAC8 (shPLAC8-SW620) or shLUC (shLUC-SW620) by puromycin and efficacy validation of PLAC8 knockdown were performed. The cDNA fragment encoding PLAC8 was amplified from SW620 cells and cloned into the NheI and PmeI sites of a puromycin-resistant lentiviral vector, pLAS3w.Ppuro (National RNAi Core Facility of Academia Sinica) to induce the overexpression of PLAC8 in SW480 cells (overPLAC8-SW480). We also amplified GFP from pEGFP-N1 (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Then, GFP\/PLAC8 (PLAC8 as a fusion to the C-terminus of GFP) and GFP alone were respectively expressed with pLAS3w.Ppuro in SW620 cells (GFP\/PLAC8-SW620 and GFP-SW620). In addition, another lentivector, pLAS3w.RFP-C.Ppuro, which was also purchased from National RNAi Core and that expressed RFP in SW480 cells (RFP-SW480) was used as the expression control. The cloned cDNA fragments in this study were sequenced to confirm their gene identity; Supplementary Table S3 lists the primers used for PCR amplification.\n\n\nImmunodetection of PLAC8, NF-\u03baB, PARP, and \u03b3-tubulin in cell lines and tissues\nTo immunodetect target proteins by Western blotting, CRC cell lysates were treated with a protease inhibitor (Hycell, Taipei, Taiwan) and then harvested using the PRO-PREP Protein Extraction Solution (iNtRON Biotechnology, Gyeonggi-do, Korea). Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Hycell) was added during cell lysate preparation to allow measurement of phosphorylated p65. To localize PLAC8 in the cellular compartment, the cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions were extracted and separated using a Nuclear\/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Twenty micrograms of each lysate in 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was denatured (10\u00a0min at 95\u00a0\u00b0C), separated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a PolyScreen 2 PVDF Transfer Membrane (0.2\u00a0\u03bcm; PerkinElmer, Boston, MA). Various target proteins were probed with the following antibodies at the indicated titers: anti-PLAC8 (1:500; ab122652; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), anti-p65 (1:1000; sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), anti-phosphorylated p65 (Ser 536) (1:1000; sc-33030; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PARP (1:1000; #556494; Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ), anti-GAPDH (1:5000; AM4300; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-\u03b1-tubulin (1:1000; sc-5286, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-lamin A\/C (1:500; sc-7292, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) following standard procedures. Different secondary antibodies, either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase, were then used. Blots were finally developed using either Western Lightning Plus-ECL kits for horseradish peroxidase (NEL103E001EA; PerkinElmer) or VECTASTAIN ABC-AmP DuoLuX chemiluminescent\/fluorescent substrate kits for alkaline phosphatase (SK-6005; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The images of immunoblots were captured on a FluorChem FC2 system (Cell Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA) and the densitometric ratio of the targeted protein to GAPDH was quantified by FluorChem FC2 as expression level (Version 3.2.2; Cell Biosciences) [34].\nTo detect PLAC8 in SW480 cells undergoing mitosis, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells were grown on four-well cell culture slides (SPL Life Sciences, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u00a0min and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 35\u00a0min. Cells were then blocked in a blocking solution (1.5% horse serum in PBS) for 30\u00a0min, incubated with anti-PLAC8 (1:50 in blocking solution; 12284-1-AP; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight, and washed twice with PBS for 5\u00a0min. Cells were then probed with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 for 1\u00a0h at room temperature in the dark. Next, \u03b1-tubulin was fluorescently detected using a protocol similar to that used to detect PLAC8. Briefly, cells on the slides were sequentially hybridized with a primary antibody (1:250 anti-\u03b1-tubulin; sc-5286, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and secondary antibody (1:500 Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse; AP124C; Merck KGaA). Both hybridizations were performed at room temperature for 1\u00a0h in the dark. Cells were counterstained with 1\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; D9542; Merck KGaA) for 10\u00a0min at room temperature to stain the nucleus and finally mounted in a solution of DAPI Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) for imaging with an Eclipse 80i florescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Like fluorescently detecting \u03b1-tubulin, \u03b3-tubulin was also observed to evaluate centrosome during mitosis. Briefly, the anti- \u03b3 Tubulin antibody [TU-30] (1:1000; ab27074, Abcam) and the same Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody were used. In addition, the live-cell images of GFP-SW620 and GFP\/PLAC8-SW620 cells were captured by the time-lapse photography of laser scanning confocal microscopy Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany).\nFor PLAC8 IHC staining, a VECTASTAIN\u00ae Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, after deparaffinization, sections were rehydrated sequentially with 100%, 90%, and 70% ethanol. These rehydrated slides were immersed in citrate buffer (10\u00a0mM, pH 6.0), boiled (95\u201399\u00a0\u00b0C) for 20\u00a0min, and cooled to room temperature for 20\u00a0min. To inactivate endogenous peroxidases within the tissues, the slides were incubated for 30\u00a0min in a 3% H2O2 methanolic solution. Tissue sections were then blocked for 30\u00a0min with a blocking serum solution (Vector Laboratories) and incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with an anti-PLAC8 antibody (1:200 in blocking solution; 12284-1-AP; Proteintech). After several washes in Tris-buffered saline, samples were incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 in blocking solution; BA-1000; Vector Laboratories) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, PLAC8 was visualized with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) as the substrate. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to identify non-CRC and CRC areas. PLAC8 and H&E staining were examined and analyzed by pathologists.\n\n\nAssessment of PLAC8 expression in association with CRC tumorigenesis in vivo\n\nFour-week-old mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 SW620 cells\/0.2\u00a0ml PBS without or with PLAC8 knockdown on the right side of the back. These different SW620 cells also coexpressed the luciferase gene, which was cloned from the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and subcloned into pLAS3w.Pbsd, a lentiviral vector with blasticidin resistance (National RNAi Core Facility of Academia Sinica). Sequences of primers were shown in Supplemental Table S3.\nTo track the growth of xenografts in mice using luciferase imaging, d-luciferin (Biosynth, Staad, Switzerland) at a concentration of 1.5\u00a0mg\/10\u00a0g body weight was injected intraperitoneally into mice, and luciferase imaging (Xenogen IVIS-200, PerkinElmer) was used 10\u00a0min later to image the whole mouse. These images were analyzed further and quantified using Living Image 3.0 software (PerkinElmer). The size of xenografts was assessed by calculating the tumor volume (cm3) using the following formula: volume\u00a0=\u00a0(width2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0length)\/2 [35]. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) were used to detect distant metastases of xenografts in SCID mice, as described by Jensen et al. with minor modifications [21], and as described below.\n\n\nPET and CT\nMice were injected with 0.5\u00a0mCi (18.5\u00a0MBq) 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose following 12-hour starvation. One hour after tracer injection, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane (Piramal Critical Care, Bethlehem, PA) mixed with 35% O2 in N2 and fixed on a bed in the presence of three fiducial markers to allow combined PET and CT images. A 10-minute PET scan was acquired using a nanoScan PET\/CT (Mediso, Budapest, Hungary). After data acquisition, PET data were arranged into sinograms and subsequently reconstructed with the maximum a posteriori reconstruction algorithm. The pixel size was 0.8666\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.8666\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.7960\u00a0mm3, and the resolution was 1.4\u00a0mm full-width-at-half-maximum in the center field of view. Following the nanoPET scan, a 10-minute nanoCT scan was performed with the following parameter settings: 360 rotation steps, tube voltage 60\u00a0kV, tube current 500\u00a0mA, binning 4, and exposure time 310\u00a0ms. The pixel size was 0.0916\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.0916\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.0910\u00a0mm3. The nanoPET and nanoCT images were fused using InVivoScope software (BioScan, Oxnard, CA). Finally, the mice were euthanized and xenografts that grew subcutaneously on the back and metastatic tissues were removed and snap frozen for DNA genotyping using a GlobalFiler Express PCR Amplification Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nDifferences in the growth rates and migration potential according to PLAC8 expression and the relative levels of PLAC8 expression were compared between samples using Student\u2019s t test or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered to be significant.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nTaxonomy-based comparisons of intestinal microflora among non-CRC controls and CRC patients\nThe NGS datasets of 16S rDNA were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (accession code: PRJNA545850) of National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine. In the analysis of the microbial community composition of the stools and PCoA based on unweighted UniFrac distances of the 16S rDNA revealed that samples from patients with late-stage CRC (AJCC stages III and IV) differed from the three other groups (non-CRC controls, patients with AJCC stage I or II disease) (Fig. 1\nA). In the PCoA plot, microbial communities were separated according to AJCC staging. Annotation at the phylum and family levels revealed variability in the relative abundance of the top 10 species. Notably, the percentages of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacterium spp. of the total phyla were up to 99.0% in each patient group, as indicated in Fig. 1B. By contrast, the family Prevotellaceae (control: 26.6%; AJCC stage I: 3.3%; stage II: 6.9%; stages III and IV: 2.5%), which is the butyrate-producing organism, decreased with progressive CRC stages (Fig. 1C).\nWe next focused on the butyrate-producing microflora with lower percentages in the stool of patients with late-stage CRC. We were interested in whether the lower percentages correlated with colon tumor growth. For all genera of gut microflora sequenced, Butyricicoccus and Prevotella had lower percentages in stool from CRC patients compared with the other groups. As shown in Fig. 1D, the percentage of Butyricicoccus was significantly lower in the stools of patients with stage III\/IV disease (0.068%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.011%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.032) compared with patients with stage II disease (0.140%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.031%). In addition, Prevotella of the non-CRC controls represented about 26.583%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.113% of the total genera; but this percentage was markedly lower in the stools of patients with stage I disease (3.277%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.963%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.048) or stage III\/IV disease (2.539%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.308%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.044) (Fig. 1E).\nWe examined further the significance of Butyricicoccus and Prevotella spp. in the validation group, which included six CRC patients. As shown in Fig. 1F, the percentage of Butyricicoccus was markedly higher in patients with stage 0 disease than in those with other disease stages. In particular, two patients with late-stage disease (AJCC stage III\/IV) had minimal Butyricicoccus in their stools. Similarly, the percentages of Prevotella showed a decreasing trend with increasing disease stage. The lowest amount of Prevotella was detected in the stool of one patient with late-stage disease. We used the OTU to compare gut microbial percentages in stools from CRC patients and healthy controls. Among all of the bacterial groups studied at the species level, compared with healthy controls, the percentage for a major lactate-producing member of the gut microbiome, Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum), was significantly lower in patients with different stages of CRC: 16.5% for AJCC stage I (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019); 20.0% for stage II (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014); and 20.6% for stage III (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) (Table 1\n).\n\n\nVariations of colon cells caused by butyrate and PLAC8\nAs detailed above, we found that the abundance of some butyrate-producing organisms was reduced in the stool of CRC patients with late-stage disease. We treated CRC cell lines with 5\u00a0mM sodium butyrate (NaB) for 24\u00a0h. PLAC8, which is highly expressed in many late-stage CRC cell lines (SW620 cells, LoVo cells and COLO 205 cells) (Fig. 2\nA), was significantly downregulated at the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels (Fig. 2B for SW620 cells, Fig. 2C for LoVo cells, and Fig. 2D for COLO 205 cells). The differential expression of endogenous PLAC8 in SW480 cells, SW620 cells or from treating cells with NaB (Fig. 2E) was confirmed by the immunodetection of an anti-PLAC8 antibody. Briefly, NaB-treated SW620 cells expressed lower levels of PLAC8 (0.8 folds), relative to cells without NaB treatment (1.0-fold, right panel of Fig. 2I). Malignant SW620 cells were next used to study the tumorigenic potential of PLAC8 and anti-tumorigenic behavior of NaB in CRC.\nThese findings suggest that decreases in PLAC8 expression in CRC cells after exposure to NaB may alter the fate of those cells. First, we found the growth rate of SW620 cells was attenuated after NaB treatment. Second, compared with cell growth without NaB, SW480 and SW620 cell numbers decreased after NaB treatment (Fig. 2F). NaB (5\u00a0mM) had a significant effect on the growth of SW620 cells (18.5% for 48\u00a0h and 2.8% for 72\u00a0h), but a smaller effect on the growth of SW480 cells (34.7% for 48\u00a0h and 6.0% for 72\u00a0h).\nNext, we found that the migration rate of SW620 cells was impaired by NaB. Specifically, the number of cells that migrated through the membrane of the Transwell inserts was markedly reduced in the presence of 5\u00a0mM NaB (Fig. 2G). There was a significant difference in the migration of SW620 cells after treating cells with 5\u00a0mM NaB for 60\u00a0min (Fig. 2H).\nWe also examined PLAC8-specific reduction caused by NaB treatment in changing apoptotic and cell proliferation markers. Knockdown of PLAC8 decreased the protein level to less than 0.1-fold in SW620 cells (shPLAC8-SW620), compared to control cells (shLUC-SW620) (Fig. 2I). Similar to Fig. 2E, NaB treatment resulted in a reduction of PLAC8 in shLUC-SW620 cells by 0.7-fold (Fig. 2I). A cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragment (indicated by red arrowhead in Fig. 2I) was detected in NaB (5\u00a0mM)-treated shLUC-SW620 cells (12.3 folds), but no cleaved band was observed in shPLAC8-SW620 cells (1.0 fold). We also measured the mRNA levels of the genes for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 (MKI67) in SW620 cells (Fig. 2J). Both were downregulated in cells treated with 5\u00a0mM NaB. However, we found NaB had no effect on the expression of these genes in NaB-treated shPLAC8-SW620 cells (Fig. 2K).\n\n\nElevated expression of PLAC8 in CRC tissues and CRC cells\nDifferential expression of PLAC8 in stool samples was also detected in CRC tissues.[12,36] We first confirmed the effect of differential expression on mRNA levels in complementary DNA (cDNA) samples from CRC patients with four AJCC stages. PLAC8 was expressed at a significantly higher level in cDNA samples from metastatic patients (AJCC stage III\/IV, n\u00a0=\u00a025) than in patients with non-metastatic disease (AJCC stage I\/II: n\u00a0=\u00a013, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) (Fig. 3\nA). These differences in mRNA levels were also reflected in the respective protein expression levels. PLAC8 protein stained intensely in CRC tissues of patients with AJCC stage III disease, and weakly in the non-CRC sample and in those from patients with non-metastatic CRC (AJCC stage II in Fig. 3B). Detailed views of the PLAC8 protein localisation in the cytoplasmic compartment are shown in Fig. 3B insets. Shown with the online tools of transcription factor binding sites (http:\/\/www.sabiosciences.com\/chipqpcrsearch.php?app\u00a0=\u00a0TFBS), nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), which is involved in the proinflammatory response, is thought to transactivate the expression of PLAC8 via a site-specific mechanism [37]. We found that the transactivation of PLAC8 occurred in SW620 cells after treatment with the inflammatory mediator lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As shown in Fig. 3C, compared with untreated cells, the relative mRNA level of PLAC8 was increased by 1.62-fold after treatment with LPS for 24\u00a0h. Like the results from the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the immunoblots showed that LPS induced phosphorylation of p65 (a subunit of the NF-\u03baB transcription complex) and increased PLAC8 protein content. The average density value for PLAC8 (1.4 for 6\u00a0h and 2.0 for 24\u00a0h) in LPS treated SW620 cells increased with NF-\u03baB phosphorylation (1.3 for 6\u00a0h and 1.9 for 24\u00a0h) (Fig. 3D). However, the increase in PLAC8 mRNA levels caused by LPS was attenuated in the presence of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor BAY 11-7082, or significantly decreased if cells were co-treated with BAY 11-7082 and NaB (Fig. 3C).\n\n\nCell growth changes in the presence of upregulated PLAC8 were observed in vitro and in vivo\n\nAs depicted in Fig. 4\nA, growth of PLAC8-overexpressing SW480 (overPLAC8-SW480) cells increased steadily compared to SW480 cells expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP; RFP-SW480 cells). Moreover, overPLAC8-SW480 cells grew faster than the control SW480 cells and the RFP-SW480 cells, and the difference in growth was significant for cells incubated for 48\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nOverPLAC8-SW480 cells also exhibited an increased migration rate relative to cells without overexpressed PLAC8 (RFP-SW480 cells), as indicated by positive crystal violet staining of the cells migrating through pores to the underside of the membrane (Fig. 4B). The number of migrated cells approached a significantly higher amount for overPLAC8-SW480 cells compared to RFP-SW480 cells (P\u00a0=\u00a00.087) (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the migration ability of SW620 cells was decreased by knockdown of PLAC8 expression (Fig. 4D and 4E; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, the expressions of genes PCNA and MKI67 (which promote tumor growth), the marker of intestinal stem cells (LGR5), and an EMT marker (EPHB2) were all downregulated in shPLAC8-SW620 cells relative to those in control cells (shLUC-SW620) (Fig. 4F).\nThe changes in CRC cell growth and migration in response to PLAC8 expression in vitro were also detected in vivo. In the animal study, the xenograft tumor size induced by grafting of shLUC-SW620 cells, which normally express PLAC8, was markedly larger than that in tumors derived from shPLAC8-SW620 cells. As Fig. 4G illustrates, shLUC-SW620 cells grew significantly faster on the back of SCID mice, based on luciferase imaging. The highest signal was found in SCID mice inoculated with shLUC-SW620 cells and cultured for 34\u00a0days, while mice inoculated with shPLAC8-SW620 cells had lower signals. Tumor size differed significantly between tumors induced with and without PLAC8 knockdown. Fig. 4H shows that xenograft tumors were significantly larger when derived from shLUC-SW620 cells than from shPLAC8-SW620 cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, shLUC-SW620 cells migrated from the primary site, where cancer cells had been injected subcutaneously and metastasised distantly to the lungs (Fig. 4I). The tumor lesions in the lung (indicated by a red arrowhead in Fig. 4J) were harvested from a SCID mouse that had received subcutaneous inoculation of shLUC-SW620 cells. The genotype of SW620 cells was determined in the tumors at sites of local subcutaneous inoculation and distant metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S1).\n\n\nExpression and translocation of PLAC8 in CRC cells undergoing cell division\nImmunoblotting (Fig. 5\nA) and immunofluorescence detection (Fig. 5B) showed that PLAC8 localized to the cytoplasm in SW620 cells. SW480 cells expressed less PLAC8 if they did not undergo cell division. The expression of PLAC8 in parental SW480 cells was induced dynamically in cells undergoing mitosis, but the cells were negative for PLAC8 at interphase. As shown in Fig. 5C, PLAC8 staining began to increase at prophase, reached a peak at metaphase, and then decreased gradually until the cells were in cytokinesis during the mitotic cycle. We next overexpressed PLAC8 as part of the fusion protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP)\/PLAC8, in SW620 cells, which appeared to disengage followed by its nucleation and reduplication and then gradual migration to opposite poles of the mitotic cell (Fig. 5D, the lower panel). In contrast, GFP alone in SW620 cells did not show the same migration (Fig. 5D, the upper panel). We also found that the GFP\/PLAC8 fusion protein was accompanied by \u03b3-tubulin at the centrosome of mitotic cells during interphase and metaphase (Fig. 5E).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nCRC is a heterogeneous disease, which develops from proximal and distal colon cells with a distinct genetic signature [38]. Identifying and detecting the molecules involved in or associated with CRC relapse or metastasis may help in identifying patients at risk of developing recurrent or metastatic CRC [39,40]. We previously found a large number of aberrant genes in human stool whose expression differed according to the clinical characteristics of CRC [13,36,41]. By accumulating sloughed cells from the colonic tract, stool provides the best opportunity for assessing CRC responses and stages, including the response to tumor therapy or CRC relapse [42]. For example, GAS2 expression was found to be increased in the stool of recurrent CRC patients and was susceptible to chemotherapy [13]. We have also reported that the mRNA levels of PLAC8 are increased in stool, and that its increased expression correlates with CRC relapse [12,36]. This CRC-related PLAC8 is also upregulated in pancreatic cancer [43] or in lung cancer [44]. Therefore, it may be important to understanding the molecular significance of PLAC8 expression in CRC tumorigenesis.\nBoth gene expression and gut microflora in stool can vary between healthy individuals and CRC patients [45]. As reported by Flemer et al., the CRC-associated microbiota profile differs according to disease severity, and these differences may be linked to the gene expression profile [46]. Our results seem to support the view that variations in the gut microflora might play a pivotal role in human illnesses such as CRC [47,48]. In this study, we found a low abundance of two butyrate-producing organisms in the stool of limited patients with late-stage CRC. However, this result has been verified with samples from validation group. This scenario was similar to that from Patel et al. who also used two sample groups (testing group and validation group) to target candidates [49]. An animal model was further used to validate these results from the results of H&E stain and IHC analysis of Plac8 in mouse intestinal tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2). Mouse Plac8 protein was completely absent from control intestinal tissues. The histological section from the colon of mouse without feeding Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (B. pullicaecorum), one of butyrate-producing organisms, showed exophytic and bulky tumors, exhibiting irregular and complex dysplastic glands, to indicate intramucosal adenocarcinoma after 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) induction. Mouse with B. pullicaecorum administration would have the less aggressive DMH-induced CRC, which was diagnosed with several small and flat lesions ranging from low-grade adenoma to intra-epithelial carcinoma. The B. pullicaecorum administration made mouse with early or pre-invasive neoplasia during CRC tumorgenesis. On the other hand, our results also confirmed that butyrate negatively regulated the expression of PLAC8.\nThe metabolite of gut microflora, butyrate, might modulate the inflammatory response to prevent CRC [50] and PLAC8 was demonstrated in association with immunity and inflammation [51,52]. We believed that this was the first report to correlate a metabolite of gut microflora to PLAC8 expression, which was demonstrated with oncogenic potential and cancer invasion in CRC [14]. Similarly, in the Supplementary Fig. S2, the high level of Plac8 in CRC tissue was decreased in the mice with B. pullicaecorum administration during the experimental process. A decrease in the number of butyrate-producing organisms and B. longum is common in the stool of CRC patients and may create a butyrate-deficient microenvironment. In addition to butyrate, other SCFAs have recently been reported to be produced by gut microbes in different segments of the colon [53]. Thus, understanding the gut microbiota through stool samples may be the first step to improving CRC patient health. The involvement of the gut microbiota in colorectal carcinogenesis is becoming increasingly clear [54]. Our results suggest that the lack of butyrate-producing organisms may limit lactate availability in the colonic tract [55,56]. We found that PLAC8 overexpression increased tumor growth. Moreover, tumor growth and proliferation markers were suppressed by downregulation of PLAC8 in CRC cells. Butyrate was reported with effects on multiple signaling pathways, including its inhibition on histone deacetylase (HDAC) to change some oncogenic signaling pathways [57]. We also found that butyrate could reduce the HDAC activity. If CRC cells were manipulated to express low PLAC8, butyrate could reduce more HDAC activity (Supplementary Fig. S3). These findings suggest that the negative correlation between PLAC8 expression and butyrate-producing organisms and its effects on colon cells may be crucial in CRC tumorigenesis.\nOur results on gut microflora support the findings in other reports that B. longum and the metabolic short-chain fatty acids, specifically butyrate, could repress colonic inflammation or tumorigenesis [58,59]. This suggests that an inflammatory response may have contributed to CRC cell overgrowth by increasing PLAC8 expression and that the control of PLAC8 expression in cells might be one way to control tumor growth. We found that PLAC8 was transactivated by LPS-activated NF-\u03baB and that this transactivation was repressed in the presence of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082. Roxburgh et al. reported a strong correlation between local in situ inflammation and CRC relapse [60]. However, dysbiosis of gut microflora, such as the reduction in the number of butyrate-producing organisms, was associated with gene imbalance in the colonic tract, which appeared to contribute to CRC progression.\nWe also found that PLAC8 is overexpressed in most cDNA samples from tumor tissues, especially those from patients with late-stage disease. PLAC8 was more highly expressed in stage III tumor sections and was concentrated in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, which was also reported by Lee et al. [36]. Moreover, we detected that mitotic SW480 cells, which have a very low endogenous expression of PLAC8, exhibited transiently upregulated PLAC8. The results suggest that the transient expression of PLAC8 is correlated with M phase of the cell cycle. From immunofluorescent images of SW480 cells, we also found that a strong positive signal from PLAC8 was found on the spindle poles of microtubules. In combination with the immunofluorescent results from SW620 cells, a nucleation of upregulated PLAC8 at the centrosome must correlate with mitosis and the accelerated cell proliferation. Thus, we suggest that PLAC8 is critical during the mitotic cycle and that overexpression of PLAC8 in CRC cells may contribute to increased tumor growth.\nExcess PLAC8 also increases cell migration, and this molecular effect may cause tumor metastasis in vivo. As shown in our in vivo experiments in mice, CRC cells with excess PLAC8 grew faster than those with a lower level of PLAC8 expression. Importantly, after subcutaneous inoculation of PLAC8-overexpressing CRC cells into its back, a SCID mouse exhibited distant metastasis to the lung. This finding is consistent with our data from another CRC cell line, HCT 116, which has endogenously low PLAC8 expression (Supplementary Fig. S4). The overPLAC8-HCT 116 cells inoculated into the back of mice also metastasized to the lung, but RFP-HCT 116 control cells did not. These findings suggest that CRC cells with low PLAC8 expression might propagate smaller tumors that are less invasive than cells that overexpress PLAC8 [14].\nWe found that PLAC8 expression in CRC cells increased with the severity of CRC. Our findings imply that downregulation of PLAC8 in CRC may alter the expression of proliferation genes, which might slow the growth and migration of CRC cells. Therefore, controlling the expression of PLAC8 with anti-inflammatory agents or treating cells with butyrate might reduce the PLAC8-induced malignant effects. Activation of the inflammatory response or dysbiosis of target microflora may increase PLAC8 expression, which may contribute to advanced or recurrent CRC. We also found that butyrate induced an apoptotic effect in CRC cells with upregulated expression of PLAC8, a finding contradicting the known anti-apoptotic effect of PLAC8 in other cell types [43].\n\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our study of the relationships between PLAC8, butyrate, and tumor progression indicate that PLAC8 expression and butyrate-producing microorganisms are critical to the growth and migration of CRC cells [61]. Other gut bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, may also have clinical significance in CRC. A metabolite of butyrate-producing microorganisms reduced the expression of PLAC8 in colon cells and therefore might have clinical significance. Our results also suggest that PLAC8 expression might be an indicator of CRC progression and dysbiosis of the gut microflora, especially dysbiosis of butyrate-producing microorganisms.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nAll Institutional and National Guidelines for the care and use of animals (The Animal Care Committee of Cathay General Hospital, Taiwan) were followed.\n\n\n","62":"\n\nIntroduction\nMelanin is produced by melanocytes through a rate-limiting tyrosinase-catalysed reaction. Abnormal melanin accumulation often causes dermatological problems, such as age spots and vitiligo [1,2]. Hence, the regulation of melanogenesis is a key method in treating depigmentation disorders, and numerous candidate agents targeting signalling pathways involved in melanin synthesis have been developed [3\u20135]. Of all compounds involved in treating depigmentation disorders, linear furocoumarins (such as psoralen and bergapten) are widely used in clinical trials (Fig. S1) [6\u20138]. However, their sources are mainly limited to plant extract and low abundance and season- or region-dependent sourcing limits their widespread application [6]. Using solvents for extraction or excavation raises environmental concerns [9,10].\nMetabolic engineering of microorganisms or plants shows promise for addressing these problems, and many efforts have succeeded [11\u201313]. Nevertheless, few reports have described metabolic engineering for coumarin production because their biosynthetic mechanisms are largely unsolved [14,15]. Therefore, it is urgent to clarify the catalytic mechanisms of the proteins involved in coumarin biosynthesis to improve the catalytic activity to enhance the yield of target coumarins through metabolic engineering. In addition, proteins with high catalytic activity can also be used as candidate enzymes in synthetic biology to complete a target pathway [16]. Protein engineering is an industrially promising method for tailoring biocatalysts, and generating enzymes with good activity to produce target compounds is also desirable in microorganisms [17\u201320]. However, the success of methods depends on accurate knowledge of the catalytic mechanisms and key amino acid residues mediating substrate binding.\nTo develop an alternative method for bergapten production and to generate a candidate protein for metabolic engineering, we previously cloned and functionally authenticated the bergaptol-specific O-methyltransferase (OMT) from P. praeruptorum (PpBMT) [21]. However, the activity of PpBMT needs to be improved [21]. Herein, the crystal structures of apo-PpBMT and a ternary PpBMT\u2013SAH\u2013bergaptol complex were first determined by X-ray diffraction with resolution of 2.0 and 2.2\u202f\u00c5, respectively. Then, computer-aided rational design was employed to improve the activity of PpBMT. A candidate mutant (V320I) with high catalytic efficiency was obtained for bergapten production. The produced bergapten positively affected mouse hair pigmentation and improve pigmentation in zebrafish embryos. The work provides a deep understanding of the substrate preferences and catalytic mechanism of PpBMT-mediated coumarin O-methylation, and also lays the foundation for metabolic engineering to increase the potential applications of coumarins.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nProtein expression and purification\nPpBMT complementary DNA was ligated into the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid to generate pGEX-6P-PpBMT (Table S1) [21]. Subsequently, the recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression, according to our previous method [21]. The protein was attached to glutathione S-transferase-conjugated affinity resin and released overnight into lysis buffer via on-bead 3C protease. Finally, the protein was concentrated to 20\u202fmg\/ml for crystallization and other assays.\n\n\nCrystallization and structure determinations\nTo obtain the PpBMT\u2013SAH\u2013bergaptol (BGO) ternary complex, we mixed PpBMT, SAH, and BGO at a molar ratio of 1: 1.2: 1.2. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for diffraction in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility on beamline BL19U1. The dataset was first processed with the HKL-3000 program [22] and further processed with programs from the CCP4 suite [23]. The collected data and structural-refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1\n. The apo structure was solved by molecular replacement with chain A of Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure 1KYZ as a search model using the PHASER program, and the ternary-complex structure was solved using Autosol in PHENIX [24,25]. The structure was manually and iteratively refined with PHENIX and COOT [25,26]. All structural representations were prepared with PyMOL (1.7.4, http:\/\/www.pymol.org). The PpBMT structures were deposited in the PDB (www.rcsb.org\/pdb\/) under accession numbers 5XG6 and 5XOH.\n\n\nEnzymatic activity and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis\nAll enzymatic-activity assays were performed in triplicate as described previously [21]. To investigate the protein stability, protein activities were determined after storage for 4\u202fweeks at different temperatures (\u221280\u202f\u00b0C, \u221220\u202f\u00b0C, 4\u202f\u00b0C, and 25\u202f\u00b0C). Experiments were also conducted in different pH values (2.5\u201311.5), temperatures (15\u201360\u202f\u00b0C), and with different ions (1 or 0.1\u202fmM Fe2+, Fe3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ag+, or Ni2+) [27]. HPLC analysis were conducted as described previously [21].\n\n\nBioinformatics analysis, docking, and computational and structure-based protein design\nFor molecular docking, we employed the Schr\u00f6dinger (Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., New York, USA) and Molecular Operating Environment (Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, Canada) programs. The experiments were conducted after preparing a target protein with the protein-preparation wizard program in Schr\u00f6dinger [28\u201330]. To improve the catalytic activity of BMT, the \u2018calculate mutation energy (binding) protocol\u2019 in Discovery Studio 4.1 was used to evaluate the effects of mutations on the bergaptol-binding affinity of BMT. The protocol performed combinatorial amino acid-scanning mutagenesis on selected amino acid residues neighbouring bergaptol by mutating them to other natural amino acids. The effect of each mutation on the binding affinity (mutation energy, \u0394\u0394Gmut) was calculated as the difference between the binding free energy (\u0394\u0394Gbind) in the mutant and wild-type proteins:\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\u0394\nGmut\n=\n\u0394\n\u0394\nGbind\n\n\nmutant\n\n\n-\n-\n\u0394\n\u0394\nGbind\n\n\n\nwild\n-\ntype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\u0394Gbind was defined as the difference between the free energy of the complex and that of the unbound state. All energy terms were calculated using CHARMm, and the electrostatic energy was calculated using a Generalized Born implicit-solvent model. The total energy was calculated as an empirical weighted sum of van der Waals (VDW) interactions, electrostatic interactions, an entropy contribution (-TSsc) related to side-chain mobility changes, and a non-polar, surface dependent, contribution to solvation energy. Candidate amino acids were selected for improving catalytic activity based on the index of a low mutation energy, which indicates a higher binding affinity. Total free-energy differences between the wild-type and mutated structures were calculated as a weighted sum of the VDW, electrostatic, entropic, and non-polar terms (Tables S2\u2013S4). Finally, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using a polymerase chain reaction-based method with KOD-plus-neo polymerase and primers shown in Table S1. The mutant plasmids were transformed into E. coli for protein expression, subsequent purification, and enzyme-activity analysis.\n\n\nDesign of animal experiments and assessment of hair pigmentation\nA wax\/rosin mixture was applied to induce highly synchronized hair growth as described previously [31]. A model of vitiligo was generated with C57BL\/6 mice by daily topical application of 2\u202fmL of 2% hydroquinone (HQ) to shaved areas (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm) of the dorsal skin, for 12\u202fdays. To determine whether drugs could induce pigmentation, the mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group (without treatment), a model (HQ treatment), and a bergapten group (bergapten delivered transdermally for 12\u202fdays). From days 3 to 15, the mice were treated with dermatology drugs for one hair-growth cycle. Topical HQ and bergapten were applied using oil-in-water emulsion creams that contained 61.3% water, 8.0% stearic acid, 8% white Vaseline, 7.0% glycerol, 6.0% octadecanol, 5.0% propylene glycol, 2.0% azone, 1.6% trolamine, 1.0% sodium dodecyl sulphate, and 0.1% ethylparaben. The HQ and bergapten concentrations were 2% and 1% (w\/w), respectively. The mice were photographed with a digital camera (Canon, Japan) once daily after depilation to assess the hair cycle. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to determine the stage of hair pigmentation based on the morphology of the dermal papilla and sebaceous glands. In addition, the melanin granules in HE-stained tissue samples were visualised histochemically.\n\n\nImmunofluorescence analysis\nImmunofluorescence was performed as described below. Sections were dew axed, rehydrated, and immersed in citric acid buffer for antigen retrieval. After washing with 0.01\u202fM potassium phosphate buffer (PBS), the specimens were treated with PBS containing Tween 20 (PBST) for 15\u202fmin at room temperature and then blocked for 1\u202fh in blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Thereafter, the specimens were incubated separately with each primary antibody at 4\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh. After being washed with 0.01\u202fM PBS, the specimens were incubated with a secondary antibody in the dark inside a cassette at 37\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh. The specimens were washed with 0.01\u202fM PBS and mounted using DAPI (Invitrogen, catalogue #D3571) and photographed with a DM400B fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The semi-quantitative data obtained using the immunofluorescence images for the control, HQ model, and bergapten groups are shown in Fig. S2.\n\n\nZebrafish maintenance and chemical treatments\nWild-type zebrafish were maintained according to the guides for the laboratory use of zebrafish in a circulating aquaculture system. Zebrafish embryos were incubated at 28.5\u202f\u00b0C as described by Kimmel et al. [32]. For chemical treatments, bergapten was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare stock solutions and then diluted with fresh fish water to 10, 20, or 40\u202f\u03bcM. The reagent 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in water to prepare stock solutions and then diluted with fresh fish water to 200\u202f\u03bcM for all treatments. The experimental design is shown in Fig. S3.\n\n\nCell culture, chemical treatments, and assays of melanin content and cellular tyrosinase (TYR) activity\nThe B16F10 melanoma cell line was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100\u202fU\/ml penicillin, 100\u202f\u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v\/v) heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum. The cells were cultured in monolayers in a humidified incubator at 37\u202f\u00b0C with 5% CO2. For chemical treatments, bergapten, psoralen, and the bergapten produced by the purified PpBMT V320I protein (synthesis) were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in DMEM to a final concentration of 1, 10, or 100\u202f\u03bcM. The melanin content and cellular TYR activity were measured as described previously [33], with minor modifications.\n\n\nStatistical analysis and graph preparation\nUnless indicated, three replicates were used to obtain the data, and the data are presented as the mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation (SD) for triplicate experiments. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey\u2019s correction for multiple comparisons. *p\u202f<\u202f0.05, **p\u202f<\u202f0.01, and ***p\u202f<\u202f0.001 were used to indicate the statistical significance.\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nBMT as a good candidate for bergapten production\nOwing to efficient separation\/purification techniques and advances in pharmacological-activity research, new compounds are continually isolated and identified, and new pharmacological activities are frequently demonstrated [34]. However, low contents in medicinal plants have limited widespread applications of these compounds [9\u201310]. Hence, improving their contents in plants or alternatively producing them in engineered microorganisms is rewarding. Previously, we cloned and functionally authenticated PpBMT [21]. Extreme stability, high solubility, and good temperature and pH tolerance made PpBMT an ideal enzyme for industrial bergapten production by metabolic engineering (Fig. S4) [35\u201336]. However, the catalytic activity of the target protein needs to be improved because bergaptol could not be completely transformed by PpBMT, a phenomenon occurring with Ammi majus BMT (AmBMT) and Angelica dahurica BMT (AdBMT) as well [35,37]. Structure-based rational design has helped improve the quality of enzymes [17\u201320]. However, no corresponding structure involved in coumarin biosynthesis has been solved. To improve the enzymatic activity of PpBMT via protein engineering, the crystal structure of PpBMT needed to be solved.\n\n\nOverall structure of PpBMT\nThe crystal structures of apo-PpBMT and the ternary PpBMT\u2013SAH\u2013BGO complex were first determined by X-ray diffraction at a resolution of 2.0 and 2.2\u202f\u00c5, respectively (Fig. S5, Table 1). The PpBMT crystal structure contained 17 \u03b1-helices and 9 \u03b2-sheets and exhibited a central symmetric dimer. The N-terminal domain involved in dimerization contained 10 \u03b1-helices (\u03b11\u2013\u03b19 and \u03b116) and 2 \u03b2-sheets (\u03b21 and \u03b22), whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain contributes to substrate binding and enzyme activity with more \u03b2 sheets (\u03b23\u2013\u03b29) (Fig. 1\na and Fig. 1b). Primary-sequence analysis and structural comparisons with other plant OMTs demonstrated that PpBMT is a type-I plant OMT resembling the Medicago sativa COMT (MsCOMT), which has a spacious and versatile binding pocket constructed with more flexible loops, although a rigid \u03b114 helix and a four-end \u03b115 helix was present in PpBMT (Figs. S6 and S7) [24]. However, the chemical structures of the OMT substrates differed to a large extent, which is determined by the shape-selectivity of the substrate pockets and surrounding amino acids (Fig. S8).\n\n\nSAH\/SAM- and bergaptol-binding sites\nThereafter, we analysed the SAH\/SAM-binding site based on the overall structure of the BMT\u2013SAH\u2013BGO ternary complex (Fig. 2\na, b). Most importantly, the carbonyl groups of Gly203 (motif I) and Lys260 (motif IV) hydrogen bonded with the terminal amino group of SAH, the hydroxyl group of Ser179 from \u03b112 interacted with the homocysteine moiety of SAH, and the side chain of Asp226 (motif II) interacted with the SAH ribose hydroxyl groups (Fig. 2a, b). Considering that SAM is a common cofactor for all OMTs, which are known to possess a highly conserved SAM-binding region (Fig. S6) [24], the data discussed below are mainly focused on the residues relevant to substrate (bergaptol) specificity.\nThe bergaptol-binding site was surrounded by 8 \u03b1-helices. \u03b11, \u03b12 in one monomer and \u03b17, \u03b18, \u03b110\u201312, \u03b115 in another monomer interacted to establish a specific cavity for bergaptol entrance (Fig. 1a, b). The 5-hydroxyl group of bergaptol formed two hydrogen bonds with the imidazole nitrogen atom of His264 and the carbonyl oxygen of Trp261, respectively. Additionally, bergaptol was fixed by two hydrogen bonds with His126 to hold the 5-hydroxyl group close to the methyl group of SAM (Fig. 2c, 2d). In addition, aromatic amino acids (Phe158, Phe171, Trp261, and Tyr319) and aliphatic amino acids (Leu122, Ile157, Met175, Leu312, Val315, Met316, and Val320) were also involved in VDW forces and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with bergaptol (Fig. 2d). In conclusion, the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effects constructed the active centre of PpBMT, which played a crucial role in its catalytic activity. When these important amino acids were mutated to arginine or alanine, nearly all mutants showed abolished activity, illuminating their significance in designing proteins with improved catalytic activity (Fig. 3\na).\n\n\nRational design, mutagenesis, and catalytic activities\nConsidering that PpBMT is highly temperature and pH tolerant, and has higher stability and solubility than other BMTs [21,35,36], we mainly focused on improving its catalytic activity based on identifying important amino acids. Because no high-throughput method has been developed for selecting a variant protein with improved activity, structure-based rational design was employed for protein design, as done previously [17\u201320]. We first mutated 10 important amino acids using computer-aided protein design with Discovery Studio 4.1. By comparing the mutation energies (Table S2), amino acid mutations with the potential for improving protein activities, such as V320I, Y319F, S265I, I157Y, and L122R (with low mutation energies of \u22120.2, 0.02, \u22120.11, \u22120.26, and \u22120.41, respectively), were selected for site-specific mutagenesis and activity analysis. The catalytic activities of mutants such as V320I, Y319F, S265I, and I157Y increased significantly (Fig. 3a and S9). However, the activities of L122R, H126R, and I157R, among other mutants, decreased to some extent (Fig. 3a). We then employed site-specific mutagenesis to design double and triple mutants, based on the single mutants with improved activities and the mutation energies (Tables S3 and S4). Unfortunately, no candidate mutants with further improved activity were obtained. A stronger hydrophobic interaction was formed between Ile320 and bergaptol (Fig. 3b), which may account for the improved activity. In addition, the relatively longer side chain of isoleucine (compared to that of valine) may also enhance its performance. BGO was trapped in a hydrophobic pocket in wild type BMT, while Y319F mutant contributed a more hydrophobic side chain in the pocket and reduced its steric hindrance (Fig. 3c). Hence, Y319F mutant could also significantly enhance the affinity activity of BMT to bergaptol (Fig. 3a). This phenomenon can be proved by another mutation, Y319R. As expect, when Y319 was substituted by arginine (a longer polar side chain amino acid), the activity was totally abolished (Fig. 3a). While, when we further mutated Ile157 to Phe157 in V320I mutant (Fig. 3d), the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction and steric hindrance caused by Phe157 pushed the BGO away and resulted in a poor orientation for catalysis in the I157FV320I double mutant (Fig. 3a). Hence, V320I was ultimately selected as the candidate high-catalytic activity mutant.\n\n\nProducing bergapten using the V320I mutant to treat depigmentation disorders\nConsidering the low bergapten content in medicinal plants, producing the target compound through plant-metabolic engineering or microbial-cell factories is potentially a useful alternative method. Hence, we used both engineered microorganisms with a V320I mutation and the purified V320I protein to produce bergapten. However, whether bergapten produced by microorganisms or the purified V320I protein has the same function as plant-based bergapten remains unsolved. Because bergapten has been used in clinical trials for treating depigmentation disorders for a long time, we tested bergapten for depigmentation disorder treatment in animals [6]. On days 9 and 12 after depilation and treatment, HQ-induced vitiligo mice showed obvious whitening of their dorsal skin (Fig. 4\na). In contrast, the control and bergapten-treatment groups showed progressive darkening of the dorsal coat. In addition, we harvested skin samples for HE staining, and morphological observations revealed fewer histochemically identified melanin granules in HQ mice. In addition, the number of follicular melanin granules in the bergapten-treated group increased to reverse the dorsal whitening. These results suggest that bergapten positively affected hair pigmentation (Fig. 4b). However, whether bergapten rescues the effects on pigmentation by exerting positive effects on melanocyte survival remains undetermined. TYR could be considered a melanocyte marker as melanocytes can be labelled an anti-TYR protein antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, isomer I; thus, an immunofluorescence experiment was conducted [38]. The HQ mouse model clearly showed fewer TYR-labelled melanocytes in the hair follicles, demonstrating that the number of melanocytes decreased following HQ treatment (Fig. 4b and S2). However, the melanocyte loss was reversed after bergapten treatment. The experiment also showed that bergapten increased TYR protein expression. HQ acts by inhibiting the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosinase and phenoloxidase and is also a strong oxidant that rapidly converts to the melanocyte-toxic substances p-benzoquinone and hydroxybenzoquinone, both of which cause skin-melanocyte loss and then depigmentation [39]. To test whether bergapten could relieve depigmentation induced by different causes, a copper chelator (PTU) was used as a moulding agent to induce depigmentation. A relatively low concentration of bergapten increased pigmentation in zebrafish embryos (Fig. 4c). Bergapten dose-dependently increased the melanin content and tyrosinase activity in B16F10 melanoma cells, and an extremely significant effect was observed at a concentration of 100\u202f\u03bcM (Fig. 5\n).\n\n\n\nConclusions\nIn summary, using a structure-based protein-engineering approach, we developed an alternative method for producing rare valuable products from medicinal plants. We determined the first crystal structure of a coumarin-specific BMT. The well-displayed atomic structure may favour a deeper understanding of the substrate preferences and catalytic mechanism of O-methylation in coumarins. Using structure-based rational design, a candidate mutant with improved activity in bergapten production was obtained. The mutant protein provides a good candidate for further metabolic engineering to produce bergapten for use in treating depigmentation disorders. The preliminary pharmacological activity of bergapten was also estimated both in animals and cells, which may be helpful for subsequent study of the mechanisms of furocoumarins in depigmentation disorder treatment.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nAll Institutional and National Guidelines for the care and use of animals (fisheries) were followed.\n\n\n","63":"\n\nIntroduction\nHuman beings encounter numerous challenges to move in water as compared to aquatic animals. Swim acceleration is the net resultant of drag and propulsive forces acting on a body. Several aquatic specimens, such as dolphins, are fully adapted to maximize propulsion and minimize drag [1]. Since a long time ago, substantial research using different experimental techniques, simulations, and modelling procedures have been conducted on the thrust of aquatic specimens [2\u20137]. In comparison with the body of evidence on aquatic animals thrust, the knowledge on human thrust in water is very limited. Human locomotion in water depends on the amount of propulsion produced by both upper- and lower-limbs while performing arm-pulls and kicks simultaneously. Noteworthy, human kicking resemble to the tail movements of cetaceans [8,9].\nHuman kicking contributes to approximately 10\u201315% of overall speed during full swimming (i.e., arm-pulls and kicks simultaneously) [10,11]. Previous research has focused on the thrust produced by upper-limbs during each arm-pull due to its larger contribution to overall swim speed [12]. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to understand the role of human kicking. However, the majority of research studies investigated the physiological responses [13,14], kinematics and nonlinear behaviour [12] of flutter kick, with few studies on human flutter kick thrust. Most studies selected computational simulations [15] and analytical modelling [16]. A couple of reports conducted experimental tests but in tethered flutter kicking [17] and a case study of stationary flutter kicking against a wall [18]. However until this date, there is no evidence on flutter kick thrust using experimental methods in a more ecologic valid setting (i.e., unrestricted swimming with swimmers displacing in water). Therefore, remains in question if the results from aforementioned studies using simulations, modelling, and preliminary experiments would be representative to those conducted using experimental methods in a more ecological valid setting. Reliable data on human flutter kick thrust can provide deeper insights into flutter kick mechanisms, which in turn can have a significant impact on the performance of competitive swimmers.\nPost-activation potentiation (PAP) refers to the increase in muscle isometric twitch and low frequency tetanic after a conditioning activity [19,20]. To induce PAP, athletes perform a high intensity resistance exercise that causes muscle contractions prior to a main bout of exercise (e.g. a race) [21]. Once the muscles have experienced a maximal contraction, potentiation occurs and would enhance athletes\u2019 muscle performance [22]. Fatigue and potentiation are muscles\u2019 mechanic responses after contraction, and PAP is the prevalence of potentiation over fatigue [23]. Recently, there has been a growing interest in determining if incorporating PAP conditioning exercises into athletes\u2019 warm-up will be beneficial in improving their performance.\nPrevious studies demonstrated that PAP could improve plyometric jumping performance [24\u201326], sprinting [27,28], throws, other upper-body ballistic skills [26], and sport-specific skills [29]; one of which was swimming. In competitive swimming, PAP may help to enhance sprinting performance [29\u201331]. Plenty of researches have been conducted on the effects of warm-up in swimming [32,33]. It is possible to include PAP sets in the warm-up routines of swimmers. However, the mechanism by which PAP enables swimmers to deliver better performances is unclear. As far as kicking is concerned, an enhancement in the magnitude of the thrust produced may exist, which may have an effect on kicking kinematics and therefore in performance. However, there is no evidence on this in the literature. Thence, the aim of this study was to analyse by experimental techniques the human kicking thrust and measure the effect of a warm-up routine that includes PAP sets on front-crawl flutter kick thrust, kinematics and performance. It was hypothesised that following PAP sets the kicking thrust and kinematics would improve and, therefore a performance enhancement should be expected.\n\n\nSubject and methods\n\nDesign\nA randomised crossover research design was selected to compare the differences between a standard warm-up without a PAP set (non-PAP; control condition) and another with PAP sets (PAP; experimental condition). All participants were required to attend three sessions (one familiarisation and two testing sessions). During the first session, participants were familiarised with the testing procedures. The first testing session took place 48\u202fh after familiarization and second testing session one week after the first testing session. For each testing session, participants randomly performed one of the two warm-ups (non-PAP or PAP) followed-up by a 25\u202fm all-out bout in front-crawl flutter kick with a push-off start from the headwall. Latency period between end of warm-up routines and all-out time trial was set at 8\u202fmin, as reported elsewhere [34].\n\n\nParticipants\nSixteen male competitive swimmers were recruited for this study (22.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.84\u202fyears, 72.50\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.21\u202fkg of body mass, 1.77\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202fm tall, 7.44\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.11\u202fyears of competitive experience). All swimmers raced in local competitions in the previous year. The inclusion criteria to recruit the subject were as follows: (i) males; (ii) competitive swimmers; (iii) competing at local, national or international competitions in the past. Exclusion criteria included: (i) non-competitive swimmer (e.g. water polo players); (ii) suffering from any injury or disease in the past six months; (iii) unable to attend the three scheduled sessions of this study. The Institutional Review Board of the Nanyang Technological University approved the study (IRB-2018-04-005). All participants had been briefed about their rights before signing a written informed consent form. Parental and\/or guardians consent were sought for under-age participants.\n\n\n\nWarm-up routines\nParticipants were randomly assigned to perform two different warm-ups in a crossover manner: (i) non-PAP (control condition) and (ii) PAP (experimental condition). Latency period between each warm-up and running in-water testing was set at 8\u202fmin [29,35]. The customized warm-up (PAP; experimental condition) was designed based on a mix of coaches\u2019 experience and evidence found in the literature [32,33,36].\nThe total mileage for non-PAP warm-up was set at 1,400\u202fm. The warm-up consisted of swimming 400\u202fm in self-selected stroke and pace (i.e., any stroke and speed of choice), 200\u202fm of front-crawl drills (25\u202fm steady\/25\u202fm fast), 200\u202fm of flutter kick drills using a kickboard (15\u202fm fast\/35\u202fm steady), 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202fm (2 front-crawls and 2 individual medleys with 10\u202fs rest in between), 100\u202fm (easy) and 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202fm (dive followed by 15\u202fm fast\/35\u202fm easy) of front-crawl drills.\nIn the PAP warm-up, participants were required to perform 700\u202fm plus PAP sets to match the overall workload of non-PAP condition. The warm-up consisted of swimming 200\u202fm in self-selected stroke and pace, 100\u202fm of front-crawl drills (25\u202fm steady\/25\u202fm fast), 100\u202fm of flutter kick drills using a kickboard (15\u202fm fast\/35\u202fm steady), 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202fm (1 front-crawl and 1 individual medley with 10\u202fs rest in-between), 50\u202fm (easy) and 50\u202fm (dive followed by 15\u202fm fast\/35\u202fm easy) of front-crawl drills. To induce PAP, in-water warm-up was followed-up by 5\u202fmin of rest before performing two sets of five maximal repetitions (two min rest between sets) of unloaded countermovement jumps on-land [34,37].\n\n\nIn-water testing\nAll participants performed in-water testing eight min upon completing each warm-up. The in-water testing was a 25\u202fm all-out trial, with water temperature at 27.5\u202f\u00b0C, using front-crawl with only flutter kicks while holding on to a kickboard (dimensions: 42\u202f\u00d7\u202f29\u202fcm) by the front edge. Participants were instructed to execute a gentle push-off start from the headwall in order to minimise gliding and not performing dolphin kicks.\nKinetics and kinematics were collected by an in-house customised system composed of differential pressure sensors (Aquanex, Swimming Technologies, Florida, USA), speedo-meter (Swim speedo-meter, Swimsportec, Hildesheim, Germany) and underwater camera (Aquanex, Swimming Technology Research, Inc., USA). Differential pressure sensors were placed between 2nd and 3rd metatarsus of each foot. These sensors measure the change in pressure between inlet and outlet (dorsal and plantar foot) and then force is derived. The speedo-meter was set on the headwall of the swimming pool, about 0.2\u202fm above water surface. The string of the speedo-meter was attached to the back of a belt worn at participants\u2019 hip. Underwater camera was set-up 0.5\u202fm deep on the headwall, providing an underwater view in the transverse plane.\nA customised software (LabVIEW\u00ae, v. 2017) was used to collect (f\u202f=\u202f50\u202fHz), streaming and playback time-series data, as well as, video signal of each trial. Data was transferred from hardware components (pressure sensors, speedo-meter and underwater camera) to interface by a 14-bit resolution acquisition card (NI-6001, National Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA). Afterwards, the data from the customised software was imported into a signal processing software (AcqKnowledge v. 3.9.1, Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, USA). Eighteen flutter kicks by each lower limb (a total of 36 flutter kicks for both lower limbs) in the mid-section of the pool (between the 10 and 20\u202fm marks, to eliminate the effects of push-off start and decrease in speed at the end of the effort) were analysed and mean values for the following kinetic and kinematic parameters were calculated for further analysis.\nKinetic variables that were analysed included the peak thrust (i.e., the maximal value, in N), mean thrust (in N) and thrust-time integral (in N.s). Kinematic variables included speed (in m\/s), speed fluctuation (dimensionless) and kicking frequency (in Hz) following the procedures reported elsewhere [12]. Speed fluctuation can also be deemed as a proxy of energy cost, because it was noted that there is an inverse relationship between the two variables, specifically when swimming the full stroke [38,39].\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nMean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation (SD) and mean percentage of individual change (\u0394\u202f=\u202fPAP\/NPAPx100) is reported for all dependent variables. Uncertainty in each condition was computed by bootstrapping 95% confidence intervals (95CI) (1,000 samples). Randomisation test was run to compare differences between conditions (paired samples, 20 permutations, 1,000 repetitions, P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05). Cohen\u2019s d was selected as standardised effect size of mean differences and deemed as: (i) |d|\u22640.2 trivial; (ii) 0.2<|d|\u22640.5 medium; (iii) |d|>0.5 large. Statistical analyses were run on R. Between-subjects worthwhile changes in control condition (non-PAP) were computed to examine the smallest meaningful improvement required when undergoing PAP. Worthwhile change was calculated by having d\u202f=\u202f0.2 as the smallest standardized effect size in sports performance [40]. Worthwhile change was then converted into smallest partial improvement to be expected having as reference the mean value of non-PAP (i.e., the smallest meaningful percentage of change from control to experimental conditions; % change\u202f=\u202fmean\u202f\u00d7\u202fworthwhile changes).\n\n\n\nResults\nOverall, there was a medium-large enhancement of the kicking thrust undergoing the warm-up that includes PAP sets (Table 1\n). Worthwhile change between subjects was expected to be 8.56% and 10.45%, for peak thrust and mean thrust, respectively. Peak (P\u202f=\u202f0.02, d\u202f=\u202f0.66) and mean (P\u202f=\u202f0.10, d\u202f=\u202f0.40) thrust increased by 15.14% and 14.60%, respectively. Thus, above the 8.56% and 10.45% smallest worthwhile change thresholds. The bootstrapped 95CI of the peak thrust shifted from 84.3 to 100.2\u202fN band to 94.8\u2013115.9\u202fN. Likewise, the bootstrapped 95CI of the mean thrust shifted from 32.02 to 36.68\u202fN to 34.05\u201346.44\u202fN. Trivial changes were noted in thrust-time integral. Therefore, there is a meaningful improvement in kicking thrust after undergoing PAP sets.\nThere was also a meaningful change in kicking kinematics. Large and significant differences were noted in speed (P\u202f=\u202f0.01, d\u202f=\u202f0.54) and speed fluctuation (P\u202f=\u202f0.02, d\u202f=\u202f0.58) (Table 2\n). Both variables improved by 10%, which is very close to (in the speed fluctuation case) or above (in the speed case) the expected smallest worthwhile changes. Participants were faster with a 95% confidence interval after PAP sets (from 0.54 to 0.64\u202fm\/s to 0.59\u20130.72\u202fm\/s). Speed fluctuation was reduced from 0.10 to 0.13 to 0.08\u20130.10 bootstrapped 95CI after PAP. Kicking frequency had a medium and significant increase by 3.17% (P\u202f=\u202f0.049, d\u202f=\u202f0.27) from bootstrapped 95CI of 2.26\u20132.52\u202fHz to 2.31\u20132.63\u202fHz. So, after a warm-up that included PAP sets, participants became faster and decreased the speed fluctuation.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to analyse the effect of a warm-up routine that includes PAP sets on front-crawl flutter kick thrust, kinematics and performance. There were significant and large improvements in flutter kick thrust, kinematics and performance, when participants performed a warm-up that features PAP sets. Flutter kick thrust improved by 15%, whereas kinematics and performance improved by 10%.\nThere is a paucity of studies investigating human flutter kick thrust by experimental testing. In a study on tethered swimming, in male swimmers, it was reported that peak and mean thrust were 100.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f28.2\u202fN and 35.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.6\u202fN, respectively [17]. Just one qualitative case study of a college swimmer reported the pressure on plantar and dorsal surfaces of the feet kicking in front-crawl at 1.03\u202fm\/s, 1.10\u202fm\/s and 1.14\u202fm\/s [41]. In another case study, it was reported that a world-record holder, performed flutter kicks against a force plate mounted on a headwall delivered a peak force of 90\u2013113\u202fN [18]. Computational fluid dynamics of human dolphin kick suggested a mean thrust of 100\u202fN at 2.2\u202fHz\n[15]. Based on an analytical procedure, mean flutter kick thrust was reported as 42\u202f\u00b1\u202f4\u202fN [16]. When fins were used, the tethered flutter kick thrust ranged between 130\u202f\u00b1\u202f23\u202fN and 178\u202f\u00b1\u202f30\u202fN, depending on the fins\u2019 model [42]. Peak and mean thrust data from the present study shows a good adherence to aforementioned results. A study conducted on the thrust of aquatic animals suggested that the mean thrust by dolphins is approximately 80\u202fN [3]. In another study, conducted in still water, the thrust generated by great white sharks was modelled by computational fluid dynamics to be 295\u202fN [7]. Unsurprisingly, the magnitude of human thrust was far lower as compared to aquatic animals.\nPrevious research noted that PAP can help to enhance sprinting performance [29\u201331]. However, until now, the underlying mechanism that led to performance improvements after performing PAP sets remains unclear. There was a meaningful improvement in flutter kick thrust after performing PAP as compared to non-PAP. Between-subjects worthwhile change was computed as 8.56% and 10.45% for peak thrust and mean thrust, respectively; both improved by 15% in PAP in comparison with non-PAP. Regrettably, the assessment of neuromuscular response concurrent to this data collection set-up was not possible. As such, it is uncertain the neuromuscular mechanism by which PAP led to an increase of thrust. However, literature points out three main neuromuscular mechanisms explaining the PAP phenomenon. The first is the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains. This causes the actin-myosin to be more sensitive to calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, during subsequent muscle contractions. Thus, the force of each consecutive twitch contraction is increased [43]. The second is the increased synaptic excitation within the spinal cord. It results in increased post-synaptic potentials and subsequent increased force [44]. The last mechanism is the decrease of the pennation angle, enhancing the mechanical advantage and increasing the force transmission to tendons and bones [22]. The conditioning activity may also increase connective tissue and tendons compliance [22].\nThe findings from the present study provide evidence that PAP can enhance the magnitude of flutter kick thrust, which translated into faster swim speed. The procedures reported in previous studies to elicit PAP used heavy dry-land equipment that is not available in swimming pools and is not convenient to carry. Sarramian et al. [31] utilised medicine balls and weights to perform pull-ups together with weighted vests and boxes to perform countermovement jumps. Cuenca-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. [29] investigated the influence of PAP protocols utilising multipower machines and flywheel devices. Hence, the question on whether PAP can be induced by performing exercises with minimal and light equipment or, only the body weight, was raised. Our findings suggest that using just participants\u2019 body weight and performing two sets of five maximal repetitions of unloaded countermovement jumps is a simple, convenient and effective way to achieve better performance.\nSpeed fluctuation decreased significantly after performing PAP as compared to non-PAP. The improvement was 9.68%, near the 9.61% smallest worthwhile change estimated. Bootstrapped 95CI bands ranged between 0.10 and 0.13 and 0.08\u20130.10, which is within the 0.09\u20130.13 interval reported elsewhere using the same measurement technique [12]. Speed fluctuation is strongly related to energy cost of swimming, at least swimming full stroke (i.e. arm-pull synchronised with kicking). Energy cost is inversely related to swimming efficiency [45]. As such, smaller speed fluctuation is related to less energy cost while swimming [38,39]. Despite these findings, whether such relationship shows the same magnitude if assessed the energy cost of kicking and its speed fluctuation, remains inconclusive. Nonetheless, one can argue that undergoing PAP, participants became more efficient. However, swimming efficiency is not as determinant in sprinting as in middle- or long-distance events. It was reported that among the US National Team, sprinters, middle-distance swimmers and long-distance counterparts had a propelling efficiency of 47.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.1%, 55.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.1% and 61.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.2%, respectively [46].\nGatta et al. [16] noted a kicking frequency of 2.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fHz swimming at 1.2\u202fm\/s; whereas, Zamparo et al. [47] 1.29\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.14\u202fHz at 0.6\u202fm\/s. National-level swimmers performing dolphin kicks fully submerged at 1.13\u202fm\/s had a kick frequency of 1.76\u202fHz\n[48]. The present study found that kicking frequency increased from 2.26 to 2.52\u202fHz to 2.31\u20132.63\u202fHz (\u0394\u202f=\u202f3.17%). However, this improvement was lower than the worthwhile change needed (6.47%). Consequently, P-value falls very near to the rejection threshold (P\u202f=\u202f0.049) and in the lower end of a medium effect size (d\u202f=\u202f0.27). The magnitude of these variations in kicking frequency might have led to trivial changes in the thrust-time integral. In the first of two 100\u202fm dash trials, the stride frequency showed a larger effect size after PAP [49]. It has been reported that kicking frequency has an effect on metabolic response [50]. The increase in speed due to higher kicking frequency can have the detrimental effect of a larger internal mechanical work. Increased energy cost is a consequence of a higher internal mechanical work. Therefore, the increase in kicking frequency as a mechanical strategy to swim faster might be suitable in events where energy cost is not a key-determinant, such as short sprints. Conversely, in longer sprints, speed increase should be done based on a different strategy.\nParticipants were faster after performing PAP (bootstrapped 95CI: from 0.54 to 0.64\u202fm\/s to 0.59\u20130.72\u202fm\/s). Speed improved by 11.60%, which was above the 9.80% worthwhile change expected. Previous studies demonstrated that the contribution of arm-pulls to full swim speed (i.e., arm-pulling synchronised with kicking) speed is 85\u201390% [10\u201314]. Thus, the overall contribution of flutter kicks is 10\u201315%. Interestingly, at least in young participants, kicking accounts for 60% of the speed performing the full stroke [12]. In another study, the sum of arms-only and legs-only swimming also exceeded that of whole body for velocity, VO2 and metabolic cost [14]. A possible explanation for this decrease from 60% to 10\u201315% is a counteract effect of kicking thrust by tangential drag force. The latter will increase over the stroke cycle, due to an increase in speed that is related to arm-pull. According to a simulation, such increase in tangential drag cancels out the thrust effect [51]. Therefore, a 10% improvement in kicking thrust, after performing PAP, may allow swimmers to be faster by 1.0\u20131.5% during a swim race, provided energy cost remains the same. An improvement of 1% in a swim race that takes about 50\u202fs, such as for instance the 100\u202fm freestyle, means less 0.5\u202fs in the final race time. Sarramian et al. [31] reported a mean improvement of 1.81% in a 50\u202fm freestyle trial in male swimmers, after performing upper-limbs PAP. The 1.81% improvement is in tandem with the current findings of about 1.0\u20131.5%. Moreover, a standardised effect size of d\u202f=\u202f0.54 translates into a percentile gain of 21 places. For instance, if one is ranked 50th in the top-100, going under PAP and everything else being equal, moves the swimmer up to position 29th. Altogether, in elite sports, an enhancement by 1.0\u20131.5% is deemed as meaningful.\nOverall, the inclusion of PAP sets at the end of the warm-up routine can elicit a performance enhancement. Five min after the in-water warm-up, swimmers can perform two sets of five maximal unloaded countermovement jumps with two min rest between sets. This is expected to improve the kicking performance by 10% and the overall swim performance in 1.0\u20131.5%. The warm-up mileages selected are within the common practice among swimmers of this level [32,33,36]. A review of the literature suggested a mileage of 1.0\u20131.5\u202fkm [36]. Different in-water mileages in the two warm-ups aimed to match the overall workload in both condition. However, one can argue that by applying the same warm-up mileage (e.g., 1.4\u202fkm) in the control and experimental conditions, PAP might as well be seen as a strategy able to change performance on that particular moment or state of fatigue. Most selected variables increased the coefficient of variation (CV\u202f=\u202fSD\/mean) from non-PAP to PAP. The increased variability can be related to different magnitudes of response to PAP from individual to individual, as well as, to each one of them having an optimal latency period that can be different to the 8\u202fmin selected for this research. As such, swimmers are advised to determine their own optimal latency period.\nWhile this research has shown that PAP improves kicking kinetics, kinematics and performance, some limitations can be pointed out: (i) it is still unknown if different latency periods between PAP sets and in-water testing will yield similar results; (ii) future studies can be conducted to provide insight on the hypothetical changes in kicking efficiency (Strouhal number) after performing PAP; (iii) it is still unknown if similar PAP effect can be observed in other swim strokes (e.g., backstroke kick, dolphin kick and breaststroke kick); (iv) it is not yet known if PAP will have the same effect on arm-pull; and (v) experiments were conducted over 25\u202fm, and might not be representative of the swimmer\u2019s acute response in longer distances.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, there are meaningful improvements in kicking thrust, kinematics and performance after undergoing a warm-up that includes PAP sets. PAP exercise in the form of body-weighted countermovement jump can elicit an increase in thrust, which in turn is going to enhance the kicking kinematics and performance.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008 (5). Informed consent was obtained from all patients for being included in the study.\n\n","64":"\n\nIntroduction\nDue to a series of revolutionary discoveries in the last decade, vitamin D has stepped out from the shadows of bone diseases to emerge as a prominent player in non-calcemic actions. Vitamin D exists in two forms, D2 and D3, where D3 is the principal form in humans, photosynthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol precursor in the epidermal and dermal cells [1]. Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two activation phases: 25-hydroxylation in the liver and 1\u03b1-hydroxylation in the kidney [2,3]. These steps yield the biologically active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D2) [4].\nUnfortunately, almost 1 billion people worldwide, across all ethnicities and age groups, are vitamin D deficient and nearly 50% are vitamin D insufficient [5]. Paradoxically, although the Middle East receives abundant sunshine throughout the year, one third to one half of its inhabitants have deficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) [6]. Numerous studies have linked vitamin D deficiency with insidious long-term consequences that can imprint on children and adults for the rest of their lives, such as increased risk for type1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cancers and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) [3]. Cardiovascular disease is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide accounting for 30% of all global deaths per year [7]. Among all CVDs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is the number one killer in both genders, accounting for 46% of cardiovascular deaths among men and 38% among women [8]. ACS is the umbrella term for the clinical signs and symptoms of: unstable angina together with myocardial infarction, including non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) [9].\nIt would be of value to mention the positive influence of vitaminD with relevance to the cardiovascular system. Vitamin D induces vascular endothelial growth factor production, thus promotes endothelial repair. Vitamin D also protects against atherosclerosis by increasing cholesterol efflux from macrophages to extracellular high density lipoprotein [10], inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and migration [11], and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines [12,13]. Furthermore, it reduces NADPH oxidase expression, therefore diminishes oxidative stress [14] and increases endothelial nitric oxide production [10]. Additionally, 1,25(OH)2D suppresses markers of cardiac hypertrophy and regulates myocardial extracellular matrix turnover, thus protecting against cardiac fibrosis [15]. 1,25(OH)2D also suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [16]. Antidiabetic properties of vitaminD include increasing insulin secretion and sensitivity [17].\nVitamin D pathway incorporates several proteins. Two of these, megalin and cubilin, are receptors localized in the kidney proximal tubule that mediate the uptake of the filtered Vitamin D Binding protein (DBP) \u221225(OH)D complex through apical clathrin-coated pits into coated vesicles and subsequently to endosomes. There, the DBP-25(OH)D dissociates from the receptors due to acidification of the endocytic compartment. The receptors are recycled and returned to the apical plasma membrane. The DBP proteins are degraded in lysosomes, and 25(OH)D diffuses to the cytosol. The 25(OH)Dis either secreted into the circulation or hydroxylated by 1\u03b1-hydroxylase in the mitochondria to 1,25(OH)2Dbefore release into the interstitial fluid at the basolateral membrane to complex with DBP. Cubilin greatly facilitates the endocytic process by sequestering the steroid-carrier complex on the cell surface before its association with megalin and internalization of the cubilin-bound 25(OH)D-DBP. Some 25(OH)D-DBP binds directly to megalin. 1,25(OH)2D increases megalin expression, protects against renal anaemia and has renoprotective effects on kidney podocytes, thus lowering chronic kidney disease risk [18]. There are only a few investigations that have examined the genetic factors of the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and CVD [19]. Accordingly, patients with either cubilin or megalin gene mutations show low serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D, disturbed calcium homeostasis, and severe bone-formation defects, including growth retardation and decreased bone mineralization [20,21].\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of polymorphisms in megalin (rs2075252 and rs4668123) and cubilin (rs1801222 and rs12766939) with the circulating serum levels of 25(OH)D and with the early incidence of ACS in Egyptians.\n\n\nPatients and methods\n\nSubjects\nIn total, 185 patients, aged between 27 and 60\u202fyears and with confirmed ACS, were recruited from in-patient and out-patient settings of the National Heart Institute (NHI) in Imbaba, Cairo. ACS was verified as either a history of myocardial infarction or of unstable or stable angina. A second group of 143 age-matched (22\u201359\u202fyears) persons with no diagnostic signs of ACS were selected by convenience sampling to serve as controls. The baseline characteristics for all study subjects are represented in Table 1\n.\nBoth groups of subjects had controlled blood pressure of below 140\/90\u202fmmHg; only a few patients were hypertensive and were taking antihypertensive medication not known to interfere with circulating levels of 25(OH)D. All subjects were Egyptians and were therefore population matched. The presence of other chronic diseases such as, kidney, heart and liver diseases as well as diabetes milletus, was the exclusion criterion in this study. All subjects were informed of the nature of the study and provided written consent that conformed to the Helsinki declaration. Study approval was obtained from both the NHI and the German University in Cairo.\n\n\nSample collection\nThe obtained blood samples were collected in EDTA coated vacutainers. Whole blood was used for DNA isolation. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of whole blood at 2500\u202frpm (Eppendorf Fixed-angle rotor F-34-6-38, 3500 g)for 10\u202fmin at 4\u202f\u00b0C and was stored at \u221280\u202f\u00b0C until 25(OH)D analysis.\n\n\n\nSelection of the candidate genes\nThe candidate genes and polymorphisms were selected based on a prior knowledge of their involvement in the metabolic pathway of 25(OH)D in humans. SNPS were only included if they were validated and non-synonymous, indicating potential functionality, if they had a known minor allele frequency (MAF)\u202f>\u202f0.1, or if they had a previously shown association with 25(OH)D levels. The selected SNPs were megalin (rs2075252 and rs4668123) and cubilin (rs1801222 and rs12766939).\n\nGenotyping\nGenomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples using an ABIOpureTM Genomic DNA Blood\/Cell Culture Extraction Kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Alliance Bio Inc., Washington, USA). Absorbance at 260\u202fnm was measured with the FLUOstar\u00ae Omega NanoDrop instrument(BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) and DNA concentration was calculated using the NanoDrop nucleic acid application module. DNA purity was assessed by 260\/280 absorbance ratios. A ratio of \u223c1.8 is generally accepted as \u201cpure\u201d for DNA and 100 ug\/mL was the minimum DNA concentration accepted. DNA extraction was repeated for samples which failed to meet the minimum DNA concentration and purity recommended for genotyping.\nThe polymorphisms rs2075252 and rs4668123 in the megalin gene and rs1801222 in the cubilin gene were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction \u2013 restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The National Center for Biotechnology Information primer designing tool (https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/tools\/primer-blast) was used to design specific primers for the polymorphisms rs2075252, rs4668123, and rs1801222, which are listed in Table 2\n. The thermal profile of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the three SNPs was initiated with a 5\u202fmin denaturation period at 95\u202f\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95\u202f\u00b0C, annealing (temperatures in Table 1) and extension at 72\u202f\u00b0C, with each step lasting 30 sec. The thermal profiles end with a final extension period of 10\u202fmin at 72\u202f\u00b0C. Successful amplification was checked by electrophoresis. The PCR products were purified using a PureLink\u2122 PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen, California, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Restriction enzymes (New England BioLabs, Hitchin, UK) are summarized in Table 1. The reaction was conducted by combining 10\u202f\u00b5L of PCR product for each SNP with 17\u202f\u00b5L nuclease-free water, 2\u202f\u00b5L CutSmart Buffer and 1\u202f\u00b5L of the restriction enzyme. Post restriction, the products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and viewed under ultraviolet gel documentation system. To confirm the accuracy of genotyping, a randomly selected sample (15%) of the study cohort was reanalyzed.\nThe genotyping for the rs12766939 SNP was performed in 96\u00adwell plates using the validated fluorogenic 5\u2032\u00adnuclease genotyping TaqMan assay C_3135025_10 (which includes designed probes and primers as supplied by Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts,USA) using a Stratagene Mx3005P qPCR \u2013 Agilent Genomics real-time qPCR system. The assay was carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Each reaction mix consisted of the following: 20\u202fng of genomic DNA diluted to 11.25\u202f\u03bcL with DNase-free water, 13.75\u202f\u03bcL of SNP reaction mixture consisting of 12.5\u202f\u03bcL of TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix and 1.25\u202f\u03bcL of 20\u00d7 working stock of SNP genotyping assay (probe and primer solution). The PCR program started with an initial denaturation at 95\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin for activating the AmpliTaq Gold enzyme followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 92\u202f\u00b0C for 15 sec and an annealing\/extension temperature at 62\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin. Allelic discrimination assays were performed using two TaqMan MGB probes (VIC\/FAM dye) that target the SNP sites. The obtained genotyping data were presented according to the NCBI SNP cluster reports. Positive control samples (homozygote for wild alleles, heterozygote, or homozygote for variant alleles) and the negative control sample were included in each batch of samples. Discordant samples were repeated.\n\n\n25(OH)D determination\n25(OH)D levels were measured using UPLC-MS\/MS, which permitted an individualized assessment of both vitamin D metabolite forms: 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3\n[22,23]. Waters Acquity Xevo TQD System instrument (Waters Corporation Milford, MA, USA) was used for detection which consists of an ACUITY UPLC H-Class system and Xevo\u2122 TQD triple-Quadropole tandem mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. An Acuity UPLC BEH C18 Phenyl Column (2.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 cm, particle size: 1.7\u202f\u00b5m) was used to separate analytes (Waters Corporation Milford, MA, USA). According to agreed-upon standards, subjects were categorized as normal when their total 25(OH)D concentration were equal to or exceeded 30\u202fng\/\u03bcL, whereas insufficient and deficient subjects had 25(OH)D levels of 21\u201329\u202fng\/\u03bcL and less than 20\u202fng\/\u03bcL, respectively [2,5,13,24\u201327]. Intra-assay coefficients of variations (CVs) were 1.4, 3.09, and 1.98% at 15, 30 and 100\u202fng\/mL respectively of 25(OH)D3 and 3.55, 2.56, 3.82% at 10, 50 and 100\u202fng\/mL respectively of 25(OH)D2. Inter-assay CVs were 7.96, 6.29 and 6.58% at 15, 30 and 100\u202fng\/mL respectively of 25(OH)D3 and 9.2, 6.76, and 6.67% at 10, 50 and 100\u202fng\/mL respectively of 25(OH)D2. The lower limit of detection (LOD) of either metabolite was 1.5\u202fng\/mL. The lower limit of quantification (LOQ) for these compounds was 5\u202fng\/mL. The recovery of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 ranged from 86% to 98% over the analytical range of the assay.\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nAnalyses were performed using Graphpad Prism statistics software, version 6.01 and SPSS 13.0. The D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus test was used to test for normality. Odds ratio (Chi-squared test) was used to measure the risk of susceptibility to ACS. The association of different genotypes of a SNP with 25(OH)D concentrations was tested using the Kruskal-Wallis test. To test the independent association of the studied SNPs with the incidence of ACS and vitamin D status, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to eradicate the influence of age, gender, BMI and smoking on both the incidence of ACS and vitamin D status in addition to the influence of season of sample collection on vitamin D status only. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was calculated for both patients and controls for the four SNPs. Statistical significance was defined as a\nP-value of less than or equal to 0.05.\n\n\n\nResults\nThe baseline characteristics of the studied subjects are presented in Table 1.\n\nVitamin D status\nThe total vitamin D status of patients and controls was categorized as deficient, insufficient, or normal, as listed in Table 3\n. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency significantly increased the ACS risk by more than 100 folds (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001).\n\n\nGenotyping\nRepresentative gels of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism products of the megalin rs2075252 and rs4668123 SNPs and the cubilin rs1801222 SNPs are presented in Fig. 1\n.\nThe genotypes distribution pattern of the megalin rs2075252 and rs4668123 SNPs and cubilin rs1801222 and rs12766939 SNPs were consistent with the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (P\u202f>\u202f0.05). Allelic and genotypic distributions of the four polymorphisms among patients and controls are presented in Table 4\n.\nGenotype and allelic distributions of megalin rs2075252 were not different between patients and controls (P\u202f>\u202f0.05) as shown in Table 4. Individuals with the megalin rs4668123 CC genotype have a 2.2 times higher risk of incidence of ACS when compared with individuals with either TT or CT genotypes (P\u202f=\u202f0.0003). The C variant also represented a higher risk for ACS than did the T variant (P\u202f=\u202f0.0005; OR\u202f=\u202f1.863). After performing multiple logistic regression, the adjusted P value was 0.001, indicating that the megalin rs4668123 polymorphism may be a risk factor for ACS.\nAs for cubilin rs1801222 polymorphism, Chi-squared test revealed that individuals with the GG genotype have 1.7 times the risk of incidence of ACS than did individuals with the AA or GA genotypes. (P\u202f=\u202f0.0442) Overall, 80.5% of the patients with ACS were high risk GG genotype carriers, while 18.4% were GA genotype carriers. Regarding controls 70.4% were GG, while 29.6% were GA genotype carriers. However, multiple logistic regression revealed that cubilin rs1801222 might not be an independent risk factor for ACS (adjusted P\u202f>\u202f0.05).\nStatistical analyses revealed the association of the cubilin rs12766939 with ACS incidence with the predominance of the G alleles (P\u202f=\u202f0.0337; OR\u202f=\u202f1.4) and the predominance of G carrier genotypes (AG and GG) (P\u202f=\u202f0.0182; OR\u202f=\u202f1.8) in ACS patients. Similar to the cubilin rs1801222 SNP, multivariate logistic regression revealed that cubilin rs12766939 SNP might not be an independent risk factor for ACS (P\u202f>\u202f0.05).\nThe association of each SNP with 25(OH)D levels was assessed by investigating the connection separately in patients, then in controls and finally by pooling all subjects together. The megalin rs4668123 influenced 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2 and total 25(OH)D concentrations, when pooling all subjects together, and the TT genotype exhibited the highest concentrations of serum vitamin D, followed by the CT genotype. The carriers of the CC genotype showed lower values of serum vitamin D and higher frequencies of vitamin D insufficiency and of vitamin D deficiency when compared to the other genotypes. After performing multivariate logistic regression, the adjusted P value was 0.007 for total 25(OH)D. By contrast, the megalin rs2075252 SNP was not associated with 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2 or total 25(OH)D levels in either the patient or the control groups in the genotypic model. Similarly, cubilin rs1801222 and rs12766939 SNPs lacked 25(OH)D predictive abilities (Table 5\n).\nThe results are expressed as mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSEM. Vitamin D levels were compared between genotypes in each SNP using the non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test. Adjusted P values for association of SNP genotypes and total 25(OH)D (ng\/mL) were calculated using multiple logistic regression analysis.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nCoronary Artery Diseases, which include ACS, are complex multifactorial polygenic disorders that are thought to result from interactions between a person\u2019s genetic makeup and various environmental factors [28]. This case control study investigated associations of serum 25(OH)D concentrations and functionally relevant genetic variants in megalin and cubilin genes, that encode for the two kidney receptors, in the vitamin D metabolic pathway, with ACS risk in Egyptians.\nVitamin D receptors have been found in all the major cardiovascular cell types including cardiomyocytes, immune cells and arterial wall cells [29].Emerging evidence indicates that vitamin D beneficially modulates the heart and blood vessels as well as systems associated with CVD risk factors including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the parathyroid glands, and the nitric oxide system [10]. In the current study, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency significantly increased the ACS risk by more than 100 folds in agreement with previously published studies that have implicated vitamin D deficiency as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. A number of large epidemiologic studies have indicated that the occurrence of cardiovascular disorders, such as ischemic heart disease, heart attack, stroke, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and hypertension, and mortality from these disorders are significantly higher in patients with low vitamin D levels than in patients with adequate levels [2,26,30\u201333]. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, inflammatory markers, and high body mass index, was also increased [26]. The cardiovascular risk also increased across the categories of 25(OH)D deficiency, so that subjects with levels 10 to <15\u202fng\/mL had a 53% higher risk, and in those with the levels <10\u202fng\/mL had an 80% higher risk [31]. A study that monitored 18,225 men for 10\u202fyears showed that low levels of 25(OH)D were associated with a high risk of myocardial infarction [30,34].\nTill now, there are no studies on Egyptians that have examined the association of vitamin D deficiency on the risk of ACS. However, there are some that studied the association of vitamin D deficiency on other disorders such as Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [35] and rheumatoid arthritis [36]. Both studies portrayed results similar to those displayed in the current study. Vitamin D levels in patients with NAFLD were 18.76\u202f\u00b1\u202f14.37\u202fng\/mL and were 40.36\u202f\u00b1\u202f22.24\u202fng\/mL in the study\u2019s controls. Results also showed that low Vitamin D levels were frequent in rheumatoid arthritis patients (22\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.2\u202fng\/mL) compared to the controls (28.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.6\u202fng\/mL).\nAlthough several studies investigated several genetic determinants of vitamin D and their non-skeletal outcomes, studies investigating the relationship of polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway and ACS are limited. The focus of the present study was the triangular relationship between the two megalin genetic variants (rs2075252 and rs4668123) and the two cubilin genetic variants (rs1801222 and rs12766939), circulating vitamin D levels and ACS susceptibility in Egyptians.\nThis is one of the first epidemiological studies to examine megalin and cubilin, two structurally different multiligand endocytic receptors that actively transport 25(OH)D into the renal proximal cells [37]. Megalin and cubilin are two receptors localized on the apical membrane of the proximal tubular cells in the kidney and work in concert to mediate the uptake of the complexes of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and 25(OH)D that are filtered by the kidneys. The receptors are recycled back to the membrane, whereas the 25(OH)D ligands are either secreted into the circulation or hydroxylated by 1 \u03b1 -hydroxylase in the mitochondria to the active 1,25(OH)2D form [20,21].\nRegarding megalin rs2075252 SNP, very similar genotype distribution and allele frequencies were observed in patients with ACS and controls suggesting a lack of association between rs2075252 polymorphism and ACS. Moreover, the serum levels of 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2 and total 25(OH)D did not differ significantly among different rs2075252 genotypes in both study groups. By contrast, CC genotype of megalin rs4668123 SNP was associated with an increased incidence of ACS in patients and the C allele was a risk factor compared to the T allele. Compared with the homozygous CC genotype, carrying the heterozygous CT or homozygous TT genotypes provided a significant protective effect against developing ACS.\nOn comparing the genotype distribution of the studied SNPs among the control subjects of the current study to published studies, the distribution pattern of rs2075252 SNP and rs4668123 SNP were different from Asian subjects [38]. Another study reported that rs2075252 SNP genotype distribution in German controls was: CC 55% CT 38% and TT 7% which differed from the genotypic pattern of this study\u2019s Egyptian controls. The rs4668123 SNP genotype distribution in German controls was 53% CC, 37% CT and 10% TT. The allele distribution of SNP rs4668123 was similar to that in the Egyptians in the present study, where the T-allele frequency in the controls group was 28% and 32% in Germans and Egyptians respectively [39].\nSerum vitamin D levels also differed significantly among the various megalin rs4668123 genotypes in all study subjects. The serum 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2 and total 25(OH)D were the highest in TT genotype and lowest in the CC genotype, and intermediate in the CT genotype. Multiple logistic regression revealed that megalin rs4668123 genotype represents an independent determinant for total 25(OH)D. Taken together, these results suggest that the non-synonymous megalin rs4668123 SNP could potentially alter the functionality of the encoded megalin protein to affect the reabsorption of 25(OH)D-DBP complex from the proximal tubular lumen. The result would be a phenotype that has altered levels of total 25(OH)D in the plasma. Consequently, the TT genotype in megalin rs4668123 SNP would greatly promote the reabsorption of 25(OH)D into the cells, thereby increasing the total 25(OH)D in plasma and acting as an independent cardioprotective factor, in contrast to the CC genotype. Further studies are required to confirm this.\nTo the best of found knowledge, this is the first study to examine polymorphisms within the megalin gene for associations with ACS and vitamin D levels. Other studies have examined megalin polymorphisms in association with other non-skeletal diseases. A study reported the association of TT genotypes of the megalin rs2075252 SNP and elevated central adiposity in non-Hispanic white US adults. Elevated central adiposity increases the incidence of ACS [40]. This contrasts with this study\u2019s conclusion that the TT genotype in megalin rs4668123 is a protective genotype with respect to the susceptibility to ACS.\nRegarding cubilin rs1801222, the GG genotype was associated with a 1.737-fold increase in the incidence of ACS compared to individuals with the AA or GA genotypes. The genotype distribution in the Egyptian controls was 70.4% homozygous GG and 29.6% heterozygous AG. Likewise, a Chinese study showed a genotype distribution of GG 61%, GA 34%, and AA 5% in a Shanghai population and GG 72%, GA 26%, and AA 2% in a in Shandong population [41]. 85% of control subjects in this study were G-allele carriers and 15% were A-allele carriers. These findings differed from those of another study where a population of a European descent had an A-allele frequency of 34% [42].\nThe serum levels of 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2 and total 25(OH)D did not differ significantly among different cubilin rs1801222 genotypes in either group. These results were contradicted by a study that reported that GG genotype possessed significantly lower 1,25(OH)2D3\nplasma levels [43].\nThe cubilin rs12766939 SNP showed a significant difference in both genotype distribution patterns and allele frequencies between the patients with ACS and the controls. The G allele presented a higher risk of ACS incidence than did the A allele; thus, individuals with GG\u202f+\u202fAG genotypes were more prone to develop ACS. The serum levels of 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2 and total 25(OH)D were not significantly different among different rs12766939 genotypes in either group. A Cardiovascular Health Study Discovery Cohort, by Levin et al., conducted on 1514 participants from the US, identified interactions between cubilin rs1801222 and rs12766939 and low circulating 25(OH)D levels and increased risk of the studied diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI) [44]. The current study only acknowledged the association of those SNPs had on ACS risk but found no association with circulating vitamin D levels.\nOther factors that might have influenced the vitamin D status such as usage of sunscreen, vitamin D supplementation and alcohol consumption are lacking. Smoking also might had an impact on vitamin D levels [45]. These might be considered the study\u2019s limitations. No ECG data were available for control subjects. There was also no data on lipid profiles of the subjects available. Moreover, genotypic variants also might have an association with survival rates after ACS, However, the study was cross sectional and survival rates after developing ACS weren\u2019t tracked.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of the present study indicate that megalin rs4668123 SNP genotype CC, cubilin rs1801222 SNP genotype GG and cubilin rs12766939 SNP genotype GG are associated with a higher ACS incidence and can be considered risk factors, according to Chi-squared test. Conversely,the megalin rs2075252 SNP was not associated with increased ACS incidence. However, after performing multiple logistic regression analysis, only the megalin rs4668123 SNP was considered an independent ACS risk factor. Furthermore,the megalin rs4668123 CC genotype was associated with lower 25(OH)D levels. Replication of these findings in different populations, including populations of other racial and ethnic groups, will be of interest for confirming the biological significance of these polymorphisms in relation to vitamin D levels and the incidence of ACS.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThe project was evaluated by the Ethics Committee of the German University in Cairo with regard participation of human patients or animals and\/or clinical samples obtained from humans or animals, and with the respect of anonymity guaranteed to patients from whom any samples are being obtained.\n\n\n","65":"\n\nIntroduction\nMalaria is one of the most severe public health problems, posing significant risks to the lives of children, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Although cases of malaria have decreased by an estimated 20 million since 2010 [1], there was no significant progress in reducing the number of global cases from 2015 to 2017 [1]. Current efforts to prevent malaria mainly include preventive and symptomatic treatment with antimalarial compounds, consisting of artemisinin-based combination therapies [2], as well as vector control with long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) [3,4]; these methods have resulted in reductions in case incidence and mortality. However, increasing evidence has revealed that these efforts can only go so far [1,5]. Therefore, we need to determine and invest in additional effective measures to tackle the complex challenges.\nGood hygiene is universally known as one of the most efficacious and straightforward measures to prevent disease transmission [6]. To date, the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) component of the strategy has received little attention, and the potential to link WASH efforts with malaria and neglected tropical disease (NTD) transmission has been largely untapped [7]. Some studies explored the effect of water and sanitation (WS) on malaria in Ethiopia and Kenya on a small scale [8\u201311], but there are no clear existing studies that have comprehensively evaluated the association between different types of WS conditions and malaria infection among children under five years old across a broad epidemic region, such as SSA. Considering the target date for the malaria roadmap and for the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of universal access to basic WASH in communities, schools, and health care facilities is both 2030 [7,12], the primary hypothesis was whether the redoubling of efforts to improve WS and its recognition as a new policy for the prevention and control of malaria transmission can contribute to the achievement of malaria elimination targets from 2016 to 2030.\nIt is well known that Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) are national cross-sectional surveys that provide data for many indicators in the areas of health, populations, and nutrition [13\u201315]. Each DHS survey usually takes an average of 18\u201320\u202fmonths and is executed in four phase [13]. Although most of the collected variables are different in each survey [14,15], the types of WS sources used by children under five years old are meticulously classified, and the available data provide a convenient condition to comprehensively evaluate the effect of WS conditions on the risk of malaria on a large scale.\nIn this study, using all the available data derived from DHS and MIS in SSA, a model analysis of the relationship between WS and malaria was performed. Specifically, the hypothesis that the odds of malaria infection in children under 5\u202fyears old with access to improved WS conditions across SSA are lower than those in children with access to unimproved WS conditions across SSA was tested. This is the most comprehensive study of the relationship between WS conditions and malaria across SSA to date, and it is also the first to demonstrate the effects between drinking water and sanitation use in relation to malaria prevalence stratified by household socioeconomic status on a large scale.\n\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and data sources\nA model analysis of individual-level data that were acquired through surveys published between 2006 and 2018 and performed by the DHS Program in SSA was conducted. The cross-sectional survey data used in this study had been provided by the DHS Program. First, surveys were excluded if the data on malaria infection in children or information on WS conditions were not complete. Second, participants in each survey were excluded if there was no data or ambiguous data on their WS use (these variables in the DHS and MIS were always represented in the form of \u201cdo not know\u201d or \u201cothers\u201d) or if their age was over 59\u202fmonths. Only children under five years old were included in this study because they (including infants) are the most vulnerable group, especially in high-transmission areas of the world [16]. More importantly, only this age group was tested for malaria infection during all the DHS and MIS surveys. Then, each national DHS and MIS survey on the exposure to various WS conditions and risk of malaria was separately analyzed for the outcome definition, exposure and covariate groupings, and stratified analysis by household socioeconomic status. Finally, to obtain a summary OR, individual national survey ORs obtained by multivariable logistic regression were synthesized through a random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n\nOutcome definition\nThe endpoint was the participants\u2019 malaria status as measured by a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy using thick or thin blood smears. A positive result by either of these two test methods indicated a malaria case. Because the microscopy results of the participants from Angola 2015\u20132016, Angola 2006\u20132007, Cameroon 2011, Liberia 2016, Mozambique 2015, Tanzania 2017, and Uganda 2016 were not available, only the RDT results for these participants were recorded in the aforementioned years.\n\n\nExposure: drinking water and sanitation (WS)\nThe DHS and MIS classified drinking water sources into five groups (piped water, tube well water, dug well, surface water, others), and they categorized sanitation sources into three groups (flush or pour flush-toilet, pit latrine toilet, and no facility). In this study, the DHS\/MIS sanitation classifications were used. However, drinking water sources were condensed into three groups (piped water in accordance with the DHS\/MIS definition, protected water, and unprotected water) [10]. Protected water was obtained from a tube well or borehole, protected well, protected spring, tanker truck, cart with a small tank, bicycle with jerrycans, bottles, or sachets [10]. Unprotected water was obtained from an unprotected well, unprotected spring, river, dam, lake, pond, stream or the rain [10].\n\n\nCovariates\nInformation on the participants\u2019 age, gender, IRS in the past 12\u202fmonths, insecticide-treated net (ITN) use, house quality, mother\u2019s highest educational level, and socioeconomic status was collected. For these covariates, age (in months) was treated as a continuous variable. Gender was categorized into two groups (male versus female). IRS in the past 12\u202fmonths was treated as a dichotomized variable (yes\/no). ITN use was grouped into three categories (ITNs or LLINs, untreated nets, or no nets). Specifically, if ITNs were >1\u202fyear old or were not retreated within a year before the survey [13,17] or if LLINs were 3\u202fyears old at the time of survey, these nets were considered \u201cuntreated nets\u201d [13,18\u201320]. House quality was divided into two groups (modern versus traditional). Houses built with finished walls, a finished roof, and a finished floor were categorized as \u201cmodern\u201d, while all other houses were categorized as \u201ctraditional\u201d [13]. Mother\u2019s highest educational level was classified into four groups (no education, primary, secondary, or higher), which were in accordance with the DHS\/MIS definitions. The DHS and MIS classified the population\u2019s socioeconomic status into five categories, namely, \u201cpoorest\u201d, \u201cpoor\u201d, \u201cmiddle\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, and \u201crichest\u201d. In this study, the total population was classified into two groups for further stratified analyses, namely, \u201cpoor\u201d (poorest\u202f+\u202fpoor) and \u201cnonpoor\u201d (middle\u202f+\u202frich\u202f+\u202frichest). No missing values were observed for all the other covariates in each survey, except for IRS in the past 12\u202fmonths and mother\u2019s highest educational level in some surveys (no data on IRS in the past 12\u202fmonths in Angola 2011, DRC 2013\u20132014, Kenya 2015, Liberia 2009, Madagascar 2016, Malawi 2017, Rwanda 2014\u20132015, Rwanda 2010, Tanzania 2017, Togo 2017, Togo 2013\u20132014, Uganda 2009; no data on mother\u2019s highest educational level in Rwanda 2017).\n\n\nStratified analyses by household socioeconomic status\nFor descriptive analyses, chi-square (\u03c72) tests or Fisher\u2019s exact tests were used for each survey to compare the prevalence of unprotected water and piped water with that of protected water, and the prevalence of flush toilets and no facility sources with that of pit latrine toilets among the total population. Chi-square (\u03c72) tests or Fisher\u2019s exact tests were also used to compare the proportion of \u201cpoor\u201d associated with different WS conditions for each survey.\nSecond, a logistic regression model was used to conduct the primary analysis of the total population to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the associations between different WS conditions and malaria infection for each survey, considering protected water and pit latrine toilets as reference. In these regression analyses, aORs were adjusted for (i) age in months, (ii) gender, (iii) IRS in the past 12\u202fmonths, (iv) ITN use, (v) house quality, and (vi) mother\u2019s highest educational level. The main reasons for the retention of the above covariables in the \u201cbest\u201d model were based on clinical or statistical significance in previous studies [13,17,21]. Furthermore, for the stratified analyses, the population was first categorized into two groups, namely, \u201cpoor\u201d children and \u201cnonpoor\u201d children in each survey. Then, the aORs revealing the associations between WS conditions and the odds of malaria infection in children aged 0\u201359\u202fmonths in a logistic regression model were performed for each DHS\/MIS survey among those who were \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cnonpoor\u201d, respectively, adjusting for the above confounding factors.\nFinally, a meta-analysis method was performed to combine data from independent scientific trials as well as observational studies. In this study, each national survey was conducted independently. Using national survey data based on a random-effects meta-analysis might eliminate many biases typically related to pooling observational data, such as publication, selection, and measurement biases and selective outcome reporting bias. In this study, to determine the overall and the stratified aORs for WS and malaria risks among all the surveys, random-effect models in the meta-analysis were used to pool logistic regression results for the surveys which were calculated among total children, \u201cpoor\u201d children, and \u201cnonpoor\u201d children, respectively. Furthermore, to investigate the heterogeneity among the survey-specific effects, Tau-squared statistics, I2\n statistics and P-values were analyzed with chi-square and Cochran\u2019s Q tests.\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA), except for the meta-analysis and forest plots, which were performed using STATA version 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, 77845, USA) and relating line diagrams and bar charts in GRAPHPAD PRISM version 7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). P\u202f<\u202f0.05 for each overall aOR was considered statistically significant.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nStudy population\nAfter screening 189 identified surveys (136 DHS, 27 MIS, and 26 others) published between 2006 and 2008, none of 138 surveys met the inclusion criteria because they did not document malaria infection status (Additional file 1). After the removal of 138 surveys, 2 surveys were further excluded because they did not contain data on WS use (Additional file 1). Finally, 49 surveys (23 DHS, 24 MIS, and 2 others) including data for 307,365 individuals from 23 countries (Additional file 1) were identified. Among the identified individuals, 6,058 did not record information on WS use, and the age of 53,867 individuals was over 59\u202fmonths; thus, these 59,925 individuals were excluded (Additional file 1). Overall, 49 eligible surveys comprising data for 247,440 individuals were included in the analysis (Additional file 1).\n\nTable 1\n provides the descriptive statistics for the health outcomes and covariates. Of the included individuals, 213,920 children aged 0\u201359\u202fmonths were tested for malaria infection using microscopy, with a prevalence of 18.8%, whereas 59,988 (24.2%) positive cases were identified in 247,440 children by RDTs (Table 1). Across all surveys, the average age of the children was 32.6\u202fmonths, and 50.2% were male (Table 1). Nearly half (47.3%) of the mothers had no education, this proportion ranged from 10.1% (Malawi 2017) to 83.0% (Burkina Faso 2010). With regard to preventive measures targeting vectors, data on the use of ITNs and IRS for each survey were extracted. As shown in Table 1, it is clear that ITN usage was less than half (45.8%) overall and ranged from 15.2% (Cameroon 2011) to 71.5% (Burkina Faso 2014). Among the households surveyed, 12.5% experienced IRS in the past 12\u202fmonths. With regard to house quality, the majority of the overall houses were traditional (69.7%), ranging from 38.1% (Ghana 2014) to 100% (Uganda 2009).\n\n\nDrinking water and sanitation (WS) and household socioeconomic status\n\nFig. 1\n presents the proportion of WS in the 23 countries in this study. Across all surveys, 35.4% of the included children had access to unprotected water, followed by protected water (32.5%) and piped water (32.1%) (Fig. 1A). Additionally, Fig. 1B demonstrates that most children utilized pit latrine toilets (62.4%), followed by no facilities (26.8%) and flush toilets (10.8%). The proportion of households with a \u201cpoor\u201d (versus \u201cnonpoor\u201d) socioeconomic status was 48.6% overall and ranged from 31.8% (Malawi 2017) to 61.4% (Liberia 2011) (Table 1). The greatest proportion of children who were classified as having a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status were unprotected water users (69.6%), followed by protected water users (46.5%) and piped water users (26.7%) (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 2\nA). Additionally, Fig. 2B illustrates that the proportion of children with \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status who were no facility users (77.7%) was higher than the proportions of those who were pit latrine toilet users (42.6%) and flush-toilet users (8.6%) (P\u202f<\u202f0.001).\n\n\nAssociation between drinking water and sanitation (WS) and malaria infection\nAcross all surveys, the comparison of malaria infections diagnosed by microscopy among individuals with different WS access in different countries revealed that the prevalence rates of malaria among the unprotected water users (22.6%) and piped water users (7.5%) were both significantly lower the prevalence rate among the protected water users (22.6% versus 26.8%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; 7.6% versus 26.8%, P\u202f<\u202f0.001); however, this trend was not always consistent in all the surveys (Fig. 3\nA). Children who used no facilities were more likely to have malaria than children who used pit latrine toilets (Fig. 3B) according to microscopy (27.7% versus 17.4%, P\u202f<\u202f0.001), whereas children who used flush toilets had a low tendency of malaria infection (4.5% versus 17.4%, P\u202f<\u202f0.001); this trend was consistent in each survey (Fig. 3B). Data on malaria infections measured by RDTs in exposed and unexposed groups were provided by a survey, as shown in Additional file 2.\nFor the total population, the specific regression results for each survey based on the logistic regression model are shown in the forest plot (Fig. 4\n, Additional file 3). Across all surveys, unprotected water users were associated with a significantly increased prevalence of malaria (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.27, P\u202f=\u202f0.001) as measured by microscopy (Table 2\n, Fig. 4A), while piped water users were associated with a significantly decreased prevalence of malaria (aOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.45\u20130.59, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) as measured by microscopy (Table 2, Fig. 4B). Both results were retained when adjustments were made for age, gender, IRS in the past 12\u202fmonths (when measured), ITN use, house quality, and mother\u2019s highest educational level (when measured). Moreover, no facility users had increased odds and flush-toilet users had decreased odds of malaria risk as measured by microscopy (Table 2, Fig. 4C, D). The overall aORs for no facility users and flush-toilet users were 1.35 (95% CI 1.24\u20131.47, P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and 0.51 (95% CI 0.43\u20130.61, P\u202f<\u202f0.001), respectively (Table 2, Fig. 4C, D). The trends of individuals diagnosed by RDTs were consistent with those of microscopy (Table 2, Additional file 3).\nFor the stratified results, the specific regression results for each survey stratified by household socioeconomic status are shown in the forest plot (Figs. 5, 6\n\n, Additional files 4, 5). In children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, no overall associations with malaria risk were observed in the unprotected water users compared to protected water users (microscopy: aOR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99\u20131.21, P\u202f=\u202f0.083; RDT: aOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93\u20131.13, P\u202f=\u202f0.652) (Fig. 5A, Additional file 4A), whereas in children with a \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the risk of malaria in the unprotected water users was more pronounced than that in protected water users (microscopy: aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10\u20131.32, P\u202f<\u202f0.001; RDT: aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.38, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 5B, Additional file 4B). In children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the protective effects of piped water were still significant, and the overall aORs of the piped water users were 0.65 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.80, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in those diagnosed by microscopy (Fig. 5C) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.56\u20130.82, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in those diagnosed by RDTs (Additional file 4C). In children with a \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the aORs of the piped water users were 0.57 (95% CI 0.49\u20130.65, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in those diagnosed by microscopy (Fig. 5D) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.46\u20130.60, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in those diagnosed by RDTs (Additional file 4D)\nFor children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status who were pit latrine toilet users, the overall aORs of the no facility users were 1.14 (95% CI 1.03\u20131.26, P\u202f=\u202f0.010) in those diagnosed by microscopy (Fig. 6A) and 1.15 (95% CI 1.05\u20131.25, P\u202f=\u202f0.002) in those diagnosed by RDTs (Additional file 5A); for the children with a \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the aORs were 1.46 (95% CI 1.32\u20131.61, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in those diagnosed by microscopy (Fig. 6B) and 1.54 (95% CI 1.38\u20131.72, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in those diagnosed by RDTs (Additional file 5B). Additionally, in children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the flush-toilet users did not have significant protection from malaria infection according to microscopy; the aOR of the flush-toilet users was 0.80 (95% CI 0.55\u20131.17, P\u202f=\u202f0.250) (Fig. 6C). In the children with a \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the protective effects of flush-toilets (considering both microscopy and RDTs) were significant (microscopy: aOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.49\u20130.66, P\u202f<\u202f0.001; RDT: aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.60, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in relation to malaria risk (Fig. 6D, Additional file 5D).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the associations between WS conditions and the risk of malaria among children under five years old across SSA employing data from multi-country, cross-sectional surveys. This analysis of 49 surveys (23 DHS, 24 MIS, and 2 others) found that compared to protected water and pit latrine toilets, piped water and flush toilets were associated with significantly reduced malaria prevalence rates, whereas unprotected water and no facilities were related to an increased risk of malaria after adjusting for potential confounders. However, this association was mostly influenced by the household socioeconomic status. In children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, no significant associations were observed between unprotected water and flush toilets in relation to malaria infection, whereas in children with a \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the associations between unimproved WS conditions (including unprotected water or no facilities) and the risk of malaria appeared to be pronounced.\nThese findings are in line with several previous studies [8\u201311,22,23]; for example, Ayele et al. assessed various WS conditions as indicators of socioeconomic status on the prevalence of malaria in Ethiopia from December 2006 to January 2007 using a generalized additive mixed model, generalized linear mixed model with spatial covariance structure, and generalized linear mode [8\u201310]. All of these studies found that malaria disproportionately affected people who had a poor socioeconomic status and limited access to clean drinking water sources [8\u201310]. Similarly, Kinuthia et al. also observed an increased number of malaria cases associated with inappropriate WS conditions in Njoro District, Kenya, using chi-squared tests and confidence limits [11]. Furthermore, Hasyim et al. indicated that individuals who lived in unimproved sanitation environments were more frequently infected with malaria than those who lived in improved sanitation environments, even though the association between environmental sanitation and malaria prevalence was not statistically significant (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99\u20131.31, P\u202f=\u202f0.081) [22]. Finally, as Hasyim et al. also suggested, most individuals who used open sewage systems (domestic wastewater or municipal wastewater) at home and those who did not have a sewage system were at higher risk of malaria infection (OR 1.250, 95% CI 1.095\u20131.427, P\u202f=\u202f0.001) than those who used closed sewage systems, further highlighting the significance of potential larval habitats near houses [23]. The results of all of these studies were in line with our results; due to closed systems, improved WS users had a decreased risk of malaria infection.\nIt is well known that mosquitoes and their ecosystems are significant spatial drivers of malaria transmission. Potential larval habitats may occur due to the physical disturbances created by human fetching or storing of unimproved drinking water (e.g., splashing water on the ground when fetching or storing unimproved water results in shallow puddles or footprints; additionally, storing unimproved drinking water creates stagnant water sources for nearby households), further increasing mosquito breeding and adult vector densities near households. The top three vector species of human malaria in our study area included Anopheles gambiae, An. arabiensis, and An. funestus (Additional file 6; the data sources were derived from country profiles based on the World Health Organization (WHO) database online because the DHS and MIS did not include entomological surveys). Among these Anopheles species, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis prefer to inhabit sunlit, shallow, temporary bodies of fresh water, such as puddles, pools, ground depressions, and hoof prints [24]. In addition, water in these larval sites is often turbid or polluted [25\u201327]. In contrast, An. funestus inhabits permanent or semipermanent bodies of fresh water with emergent vegetation, such as swamps, ponds, and lake edges [24]. This evidence suggests that closed systems with improved water are relatively inappropriate environments for Anopheles.\nThe association between improved WS (including protected and piped water; pit latrines and flush toilets) and the reduced risk of malaria in this study could be explained by several potential mechanisms. There are data that indicate that wealth is probably protective against malaria risk [28\u201334], as prevention and treatment are affordable [35\u201337]. In this study, among the total participants, socioeconomic status (a confounder) determined access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene practices and malaria prevention practices, all of which affected the level of malaria risk [8\u201310]. We can easily see that the highest proportion of children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status were unimproved WS users (Fig. 2). To address the confounding nature of socioeconomic status, the results of WS conditions and prevalence of malaria in children under five years old were stratified by household socioeconomic status, and the aORs within each socioeconomic level were calculated. In the stratified results, the mixed effects of wealth weighed heavily upon the WS conditions related to malaria risk in the children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status (Table 2). This nonsignificant phenomenon was mostly attributed to the decreased proportion of improved water access in children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status (Fig. 2). This result simply showed that malaria infection rates were the highest among the poorest populations who had little or no access to safe drinking water and toilets.\nRegarding the overall OR results between children with a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the effects of WS and malaria infections were more obvious in the children with a \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status (Table 2), demonstrating that it is urgent to improve WS conditions in nonpoor populations if economic circumstances permit. The important finding in this study was that in the children with a \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status, the effects of WS conditions were still significant even without the confounding effects of socioeconomic status. This may be explained by the fact that unimproved WS users may indirectly increase the likelihood of contracting Plasmodium falciparum by increasing the risk of other waterborne parasitic diseases, such as soil transmitted helminth diseases (STHs, such as hookworm, Strongyloides stercoralis) or Schistosoma haematobium infections directly [38\u201342].\nAccording to previous studies, we hypothesize that children who have STHs or schistosomiasis may be more susceptible to malaria infection [38\u201345]. There are many mechanisms to support this theory. For example, Strongyloides stercoralis could increase the risk of Plasmodium infection because of the predominance of Th2 responses in young children [38,39]. Furthermore, schistosomiasis infection alone or in combination with trichiasis or hookworm infection can apparently increase the risk of P. falciparum by modulating the immune system [41\u201343]. Additionally, helminth-infected individuals can present decreased cutaneous reactivity to anopheline bites, which may theoretically facilitate the success of sporozoite introduction [44,45]. There are also many previous studies exploring the risk factors of STH or Schistosoma haematobium and malaria coinfections, and all these articles indicate that unsafe WASH conditions are the primary risk factors associated with such coinfections [38,46,47], suggesting that clean WS conditions can help to prevent malaria infections. Finally, the most important distinction between unimproved water and improved water is whether drinking water is treated. In this study, it was apparent that a high proportion of disposed unprotected water was linked to a relatively low prevalence of malaria (Additional file 7).\nThe strength of this study includes the large and comprehensive dataset obtained from the DHS and MIS. The analysis aimed to elucidate the influence of household WS on malaria risk stratified by household socioeconomic status on a large scale for the first time. Some studies have indicated that many high-income countries eliminated malaria without malaria-specific interventions; for example, malaria in Europe and North America declined as a result of improved living conditions and increased wealth [48]. As Lucy Tusting et al. stated, halting existing malaria control efforts is not recommended; however, we believe there is a need to increase investment in interventions that support socioeconomic development [33]. Although wealth status is a combination of multiple factors, it is important to know which specific aspect of wealth affects malaria infection. In this study, the mixed effects of socioeconomic status were eliminated, and we focused on exploring the relationship between WS and malaria. Water-associated vector-borne diseases (including malaria and many NTDs) continue to be a major public health problem in many developing countries [7]. However, remarkable and significant progress in the prevention and control of water-related vector-borne diseases has been made in many regions, primarily through the strengthening of vector control strategies, case detection, and treatment methods [1,7]. These present strategies must be expanded. Strengthening of intersectoral links with improving WASH may provide a method to increase the pace of malaria elimination. Although the SDGs have offered unprecedented opportunities to improve health by dramatically increasing the availability and use of WASH services [7], the coverage of safe WASH in SSA is still very low. These findings suggest that efforts should be redoubled to improve WS conditions, which should be considered an important component of malaria prevention and control. Finally, the use of pooled observational multicountry data eliminated many biases, including publication, selection, and measurement biases and selective outcome reporting, which are typically presented in traditional systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\nThis study has several limitations. First, it did not explore the association between drinking water storage sites and malaria infection. However, in this study data on drinking water storage sites were absent in many surveys, making it too difficult to link the various types of drinking water sources with their storage sites. Further studies are needed to investigate the influence of storage sites in depth. Second, although the results of WS conditions and malaria prevalence among children under 5\u202fyears old were stratified by household socioeconomic level, the stratification (\u201cpoor\u201d versus \u201cnonpoor\u201d) in this study was not very prudent because of the original stratifications in the DHS and MIS were grouped into five categories, namely, \u201cpoorest\u201d, \u201cpoor\u201d, \u201cmiddle\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, and \u201crichest\u201d. There may still be residual confounding caused by wealth status in our study. However, considering the proportion of children with a \u201cpoor\u201d socioeconomic status (approximately 50%) (Table 1), this study classified the total children into two groups to avoid an uneven sample distribution. Furthermore, entomological surveys, particularly among unimproved drinking water sources and unimproved sanitation facilities in SSA, are important to understand how the type and the behavior of Anopheles species affect malaria transmission and to assist in addressing confounding factors involving the various ecological niches of distinct species. Unfortunately, entomological surveys were not conducted in the DHS and MIS surveys. Finally, due to the lack of examination in the DHS Program of other parasitic diseases, such as STHs or schistosomiasis, the proposed effect of coinfections is still under speculation in this study. It would be beneficial to add coinfection investigations to the DHS and MIS in the future.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, WS conditions were important risk factors for malaria among children under five years old across SSA after adjustments for age, gender, IRS in the past 12\u202fmonths and insecticide-treated use, house quality, and mother\u2019s highest educational level. Unimproved WS access (unprotected water; no facility) was related to a relatively high risk of malaria. Furthermore, this association was mostly influenced by socioeconomic status. However, the malaria risk associated with unimproved WS was more pronounced among the children with a \u201cnonpoor\u201d socioeconomic status. These findings indicated incremental improvements to WS in SSA might be considered a potential intervention for the prevention and control of malaria in the long term.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThe DHS Program has the compliance with ethics requirements.\n\n\n","66":"\n\nIntroduction\nAnimal welfare is important for animal based biomedical research. Therefore, many countries have implemented new regulations to ensure high-quality research with minimal harm to animals. The European Union requires application of the 3Rs (replace, reduce, refine), a harm and benefit analysis and a prospective severity assessment for each animal experiment [1\u20133]. To adequately implement these mandatory guidelines, an evidenced-based distress analysis for laboratory animals is essential. However, guidance and examples of comprehensive distress analyses or studies that compare the suitability of different distress parameters are difficult to find in the current literature. Mice and rats are the most commonly used laboratory animals in biomedical research. These prey animals usually suppress signs of pain, suffering and weakness. Therefore, highly sensitive readout parameters are mandatory for evaluating distress or wellbeing in rodents [4].\nWell-being or welfare of animals is fulfilled when the nutritional, environmental, health, behavioural and mental needs of animals are satisfied [5]. Different interventions, such as surgery or handling procedures, can provoke short time stress responses or even \u201cdistress\u201d, where an animal is unable to adapt for a distinct period of time to the different stressors or its environment [6]. This distress can be evaluated by indicators of the physical, biochemical and psychological state of animals [7]. As indicators of the physical condition of an animal, changes in body weight and clinical scoring systems have proven useful for assessing severity and as criteria to determine a humane end point [8\u201310]. Changes in so-called \u201cluxury\u201d behaviour, i.e., burrowing and nesting activity, reflect the psychological state of animals. These natural behaviours are comparable to activities of daily living in humans, and good performance should represent well-being in mice and rats [11\u201313]. However, deterioration of nesting and burrowing activity might function as an indicator for neurological disorder [14\u201316], pain and stress [17\u201319]. In addition, the stress hormone corticosterone is a sensitive distress indicator, and the measurement of its metabolites in faeces represents a novel non-invasive method to assess distress by analysing the biochemical state of animals [20,21]. In addition to these non-invasive approaches, heart rate (HR), body temperature (BT) and activity (Act) have proven to be important readout parameters for the physical state of an animal. Continuous monitoring of these parameters can be provided by telemetry using implanted radio telemetric transmitters [22,23]. HR reportedly increases after acute restraint stress [24\u201326], cage change [27], and laparotomy [17]. Stress induced hypothermia was observed after handling [23], cage change [27,28] and different injections [29]. Moreover, it is an accepted method to measure anxiety [30]. Activity of mice was reported to be enhanced after short term stressors, such as handling [23] and cage change [27] or reduced upon laparotomy and chronic tumour disease [31]. These publications indicate that HR, BT and Act might function as sensitive readout parameters for assessing animal distress. The aim of the current study was to directly compare non-invasive methods to telemetric parameters for assessing distress in a murine orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nEthical statement\nAll animal experiments were approved by the local authority (Landesamt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Fischerei Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; Az. 7221.3-1-062\/16). Decisions of the local authority were in accordance with the protection of animal act for Germany and the European Directive 2010\/63\/EU [2]. Male C57BL\/6J mice between 13 and 15\u202fweeks of age were housed separately in type III cages (dark light cycle; dark period: 7 pm-7am) with food and water ad libitum. Enrichment was provided in the form of nesting material, paper roles, and wooden sticks.\n\n\nTransmitter implantation and telemetry\nFor transmitter implantation, each mouse was anaesthetized with 1\u20132\u202fvol% isoflurane. For perioperative analgesia, 5\u202fmg\/kg carprofen was injected subcutaneously (Rimadyl\u00ae, Pfizer GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The eyes of the mouse were kept wet by using eye ointment (Jenapharm, Jena, Germany). The abdomen and the right sight of the thorax were shaved. A mid line laparotomy was performed, and the ETA-F-10 transmitter (Data Sciences International, Minnesota, USA), which is able to detect ECG signals, BT and Act of the mice, was placed in the abdominal cavity. The telemetry lead for the negative electrode was tunnelled subcutaneously from the peritoneum to the right side of the thorax, and the end of the electrode was fixed with two sutures (4\u20130 polyester, non-absorbable, SMI sutures, Steinberg, Belgium) in the pectoralis major muscle. The positive electrode was tunnelled subcutaneously to the left side under the costal arch and was sutured onto the external oblique muscle. The peritoneum was closed with resorbable, coated 5\u20130 vicryl sutures (Johnson & Johnson MEDICAL GmbH, New Brunswick, USA). Skin lesions were sewed using a 5\u20130 prolene suture (Johnson & Johnson MEDICAL GmbH), and mice were placed in front of a heating lamp for 30\u202fmin. Transmitter implantation surgeries lasted for 45\u201355\u202fmin for each mouse. For postoperative analgesia, 1250\u202fmg\/L metamizol (Ratiopharm, Ulm, Germany) was provided continuously in the drinking water until the end of the experiment. The mouse cages were placed above the receiver to detect the signals, and the parameters were monitored using the programme Ponemah (Version 5.2; Data Sciences International, Minnesota, USA). Data were saved every minute for each parameter and each mouse, and were analysed using the programme Excel (Microsoft, Redmont, USA). To analyse the ECG signals two distinct parameters, i.e. HR and heart rate variability were calculated (HRV) via SDANN-value (standard deviation of R-R intervals in 1\u202fmin intervals over on 12\u202fh segment; 7\u202fpm-7am). All telemetric parameters were monitored continuously for 24\u202fh after the distinct interventions and on the recovery days (Fig. 1\n). However, the conclusions were based on 12-h recordings of HR, BT and Act at night during the active period of the mice to eliminate physical reactions caused by handling of the animals or disturbances in the animal facility.\n\n\nSyngeneic orthotopic pancreatic carcinoma model\nOrthotopic injection of pancreatic cancer cells was performed as previously described by Zechner et al. [32]. In short, the mice were anaesthetized with 1.2\u20132.0\u202fvol% isoflurane, and 5\u202fmg\/kg carprofen (Rimadyl\u00ae, Berlin, Pfizer GmbH) was applied by s.c. injection for analgesia. Eyes were kept wet by using eye ointment. The abdomen of the mice was shaved, and the abdominal cavity was opened by laparotomy. Then, 5\u202f\u03bcL of cell suspension (murine cell line 6606PDA, 2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f105\/5\u202f\u03bcL cells in Matrigel) was injected slowly using a 25\u202f\u03bcL syringe (Hamilton, Reno, Nev., USA). The pancreas was placed back into the cavity. The peritoneum was closed using a coated 5\u20130 vicryl suture (Johnson & Johnson MEDICAL GmbH), the skin was sewed with a 5\u20130 prolene suture (Johnson & Johnson MEDICAL GmbH), and mice were placed in front of a heating lamp for 30\u202fmin. The duration of the surgical procedure for carcinoma cell injection was 20\u202fmin per mouse. A total of 1250\u202fmg\/L metamizol was applied daily in the drinking water until the end of the experiment (mice were euthanized 37\u202fdays after tumour cell injection). Metamizol was chosen to cover possible pain caused during the recovery days after surgery and during the tumour growth period. The benefit of metamizol is that it can be self-administered by the mice. Repetitive injection of analgesic components would cause additional distress [24,33] and influence our data analysis. To cover possible pain after the surgical procedures, carprofen 5\u202fmg\/kg was injected subcutaneously. The application of metamizol in combination with carprofen was chosen for both surgical interventions, i.e. transmitter implantation and carcinoma cell injection, in order to directly compare those procedures in terms of distress. An opioid such as buprenorphine was intentionally not applied for analgesia because it is reported to reduce food and water consumption, activity, body weight in both mice and rats [34\u201336]. Compared to buprenorphine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ketoprofen, indomethacin, meloxicam and carprofen, provoked fewer side effects and similar analgesic efficacy after distinct abdominal surgeries [37,38] and after transmitter implantation [39\u201341] in rodents.\n\n\nAssessment of non-invasive distress parameters\nNon-invasive parameters were assessed during the light phase (7am-7pm). After transmitter implantation (TI), distress was analysed after surgery (0) and on recovery days 1\u20133, 7\u20138 and 13. Evaluation of distress after tumour cell injection (CI) was quantified on the day before (\u22121), the day after surgery (0) and on recovery day 1\u20133. The assessment of distress during disease progression was performed on days 4, 18 and 34 of tumour development (Fig. 1). The distress score was assessed 30\u202fmin after each surgical intervention and at the indicated recovery days according to a clinical scoring sheet, which has been published by Kumstel et al. [33] and is based on other scoring systems [42\u201344]. Body weight was measured 24\u202fh after evaluating the other distress parameters to allow sufficient time for body weight adjustments to a specific level of distress. To assess body weight, mice were placed by tail handling on a scale for 5\u201310\u202fs. Changes in body weight were calculated as a percentage of the value assessed 1\u20134\u202fdays before transmitter implantation. The weight of the transmitter (1.6\u20131.7\u202fg dependent on the electrode length) was subtracted from the measured body weight. Burrowing behaviour was analysed according to Deacon et al. [11] by placing a burrowing tube filled with 200\u202fg of food pellets into the cage 3\u202fh before the dark phase. The amount of burrowed pellets was evaluated 2\u202fh later. To analyse nesting behaviour, a nestlet (5-cm square of pressed cotton batting, Zoonlab GmbH, Castrop-Rauxel, Germany) was provided 1\u202fh before the dark phase. The nest was scored the following morning. In addition to the 1\u20135 point scale from Deacon et al. [12], 6 points were scored for a perfect nest when more than 90% of the circumference of the walls were higher than the mouse\u2019s body height. To facilitate individual learning, burrowing and nesting were performed three times in group housing until mice were housed separately throughout the entire experiment. To measure faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs), 200\u2013400\u202fmg faeces were collected from the home cages 24\u202fh after the interventions or on indicated days. The faeces were dried 4\u202fh at 65\u202f\u00b0C and stored at \u221220\u202f\u00b0C. Later, 50\u202fmg homogenized faeces were extracted with 1\u202fmL 80% methanol and analysed by a 5\u03b1-pregnane-3\u03b2,11\u03b2,21-triol-20-one enzyme immunoassay, which has been validated for use with mice [20,45].\n\n\nData analysis\nA repeated measure design was applied without using a control group, since the aim was to compare distress parameters after distinct interventions and the corresponding recovery phases. The quantification of distress after transmitter implantation was performed on 10 mice, after carcinoma cell injection on 9 mice and during tumour progression on 7 mice, since one mouse had to be euthanized due to complications after carcinoma cell injection, and two additional mice reached humane endpoint criteria during tumour progression. All data were graphed and analysed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). Data for Figs. 2\u20135 and 9 are presented in line graphs, indicating mean values\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviations. For assessment of normality, the Shapiro-Wilk-test was applied, and for scores (distress score, nesting-score), the Kolmogorow-Smirnov test. For parametric data a repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test for multiple comparisons was performed. For non-parametric data and data in percent the Friedman test followed by Dunn\u2019s method was applied. Data for Figs. 6 and 7 are presented in point plots, indicating mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation. Significance was calculated either by unpaired t-test for parametric data or by Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric data or data in percent. Differences with P\u202f<\u202f0.05 were considered significant. To evaluate the performance of each parameter to quantify distress, the area under the curve (AUC) was assessed by performing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on data from mice before and after laparotomy plus carcinoma cell injection. The 95% confidence intervals and P-values were calculated for each parameter.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nAnimal distress after transmitter implantation\nTo assess the distress of mice after transmitter implantation, non-invasive and telemetric parameters were quantified after surgery (0), as well as on recovery day 1\u20133, 7 and 13 (Fig. 1). The distress score was significantly increased on days after the intervention, due to observations of abnormal posture and passive spontaneous and flight behaviour, as previously published [33]. However, mice recovered within one day (Fig. 2A). Compared to the day of surgery, a significant increase in burrowing behaviour was observed on day 3, 7 and 13 after transmitter implantation, indicating a steady recovery of mice (Fig. 2B). A reduction in body weight of 8% average was observed in animals after transmitter implantation. A slow body weight gain was characterized by a significant increase on recovery days 7 and 13. However, within the two weeks of recovery, mice did not return to their initial body weights (Fig. 2C). The day after surgery, nesting scores were low but recovered within one day (Fig. 2D). Mean HR during the night after surgery (day 0) was significantly elevated compared to recovery days 3, 7 and 13. Additionally, a significant reduction from recovery day 1 to day 7 and 13 was noticed (Fig. 2E). Compared to day 0, a significant increase in Act was observed on post-surgical days 3, 7 and 13 (Fig. 2F). Significant differences could even be observed when comparing day 1 and 2 to day 13. This indicates that mice needed more than two days to recover (Fig. 2F). No significant differences were noticed in BT after surgery or during the recovery period (Fig. 2G). However, a significant increase of FCM concentrations after surgery compared to all recovery days was quantified (Fig. 2\n\nH). All parameters, with the exception of BT, demonstrated recovery of mice after transmitter implantation. However, the timing of recovery, especially between day 1 and day 3, was different between parameters. All parameters approached a plateau phase of recovery on day 7\u201313, indicating stabilization of the physical, physiological and psychological state of the mice.\n\n\nAnimal distress after carcinoma cell injection\nFor assessment of distress after orthotopic injection of pancreatic cancer cells, all non-invasive and telemetric distress parameters were quantified before (-1), on the same day of carcinoma cell injection (0) and on recovery day 1\u20133 after cell injection (Fig. 1). Distress score and burrowing behaviour were significantly altered on day 0, indicating increased distress of the mice that exhibited fast recovery within one day (Fig. 3A and B). A significant reduction in the percentage of body weight was noticed on the first recovery day compared to the day of surgical intervention (Fig. 3C). A minor non-significant reduction of nesting behaviour was observed on day 0 (Fig. 3D). HR was significantly elevated after laparotomy, followed by a steady reduction until recovery day 3 (Fig. 3E). Act was slightly and non-significantly reduced after surgery (Fig. 3F). However, BT was significantly reduced, while FCMs were significantly increased, after carcinoma cell injection, followed by rapid recovery within one day (Fig. 3\n\nG and H). In addition to HR, the HRV was calculated from the ECG signals and a significant reduction in HRV after carcinoma cell injection was quantified (Fig. 4A). The analysis of the discriminatory power of HRV revealed a lower AUC (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.86, P\u202f=\u202f0.0092) compared to HR (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.95, P\u202f=\u202f0.0013) (Fig. 4\n\nB). The following analysis, therefore, focused on the HR values. The non-invasive methods distress score, burrowing behaviour and FCMs, as well as the telemetric data for HR and BT, indicated increased distress of mice after carcinoma cell injection followed by rapid recovery within one day.\nTo evaluate animal distress during tumour growth, all parameters were assessed one day before and on days 4, 18 and 34 after carcinoma cell injection. No significant alterations in distress score or burrowing behaviour were noticed during this period (Fig. 5A and B). The percentage changes in body weight increased significantly during tumour growth (Fig. 5C). No significant alterations were observed either in the other non-invasive parameters, nesting-activity, FCMs, or in any parameters measured by telemetry, such as HR, Act, or BT (Fig. 5\n\nD\u2013H). In conclusion the applied methods do not indicate a significant increase in distress during tumour growth.\n\n\nComparison of animal distress after surgical procedures\nTo compare the distress of transmitter implantation to laparotomy plus orthotopic carcinoma cell injection, we graphed all distress parameters measured on the same day (0) after each intervention. All non-invasive parameters and most parameters measured by telemetry (HR, Act but not BT) demonstrated significantly more distress after transmitter implantation compared to carcinoma cell injection (Fig. 6\n\nA\u2013H). Even on recovery day 2 after both surgical interventions, distress parameters such as burrowing, body weight change and Act indicate significantly more distress after transmitter implantation compared to carcinoma cell injection (Fig. 7\n\n).\n\n\nThe AUC of each parameter for predicting animal distress\nThe performance of each readout parameter to diagnose distress was evaluated by applying ROC curve analysis. Therefore, data from all animals were used from the day before (\u22121) and after carcinoma cell injection (0). ROC curves are typically used to graph the performance of diagnostic tests [46]. An area under the curve (AUC) of 1.0 represents high discriminatory power to differentiate between animals before and after carcinoma cell injection, while a value of 0.5 demonstrates no discriminatory power for this parameter. According to this analysis, the highest discriminatory power was obtained for the distress score (AUC\u202f=\u202f1.0, P\u202f=\u202f0.0003) (Fig. 8A). Burrowing behaviour also displayed a good performance, with a high AUC of 0.96 and a P-value of 0.0009 (Fig. 8B). In contrast, percentage of body weight change (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.68, P\u202f=\u202f0.2004) and nesting behaviour (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.68, P\u202f=\u202f0.2004) demonstrated low discriminatory power for distress assessment (Fig. 8C and D). Telemetric monitoring of HR (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.95, P\u202f=\u202f0.0013), Act (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.85, P\u202f=\u202f0.0134) and BT (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.84, P\u202f=\u202f0.0152) also indicated high AUC to discriminate between animals before and after surgery (Fig. 8E\u2013G). FCMs also exhibited discriminatory power to differentiate between animals before and after carcinoma cell injection (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.78, P\u202f=\u202f0.0469) (Fig. 8\nH). When comparing the distress after all interventions by HR during light and dark phase, more significant changes during the recovery phase were observed in the light phase (Fig. 9\n\n). However, the AUC of Act to detect distress after CI proved to be better during the dark phase (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.85, P\u202f=\u202f0.0134) compared to the light phase (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.72, P\u202f=\u202f0.1223) (Fig. 10\n).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis study compared the suitability of non-invasive to telemetry based methods when evaluating distress in mice. The animal distress was quantified after transmitter implantation, carcinoma cell injection and during cancer growth. Transmitter implantation caused significantly more burden to mice when compared to laparotomy plus carcinoma cell injection (Fig. 6). In contrast, no significant induction of distress was detected during tumour growth (Fig. 5). In addition, ROC curve analysis revealed that the non-invasive methods, distress score and burrowing behaviour displayed slightly higher AUC than HR, BT and Act for defining distress after carcinoma cell injection.\nBody weight change is an important parameter for indicating the physical state of mice. A significant reduction of body weight was, for example, observed after colitis [47] or intra-bone marrow transplantation [48]. In these studies, body weight loss correlated well with other distress parameters, such as burrowing [47] or FCMs [48]. Burrowing behaviour was also affected after laparotomy in other animal models [19] and was reported to be more sensitive than nesting [49]. An increase of the telemetric parameters HR, BT and Act was observed upon stressors such as resident-intruder test [50], handling, disturbance and cage change [27]. The above-cited literature, as well as our results, support the hypothesis that these non-invasive and telemetric parameters are able to score distress in response to different interventions.\nWhen comparing these parameters after telemeter implantation and cell injection, it can be concluded that transmitter implantation caused significantly more distress than laparotomy plus carcinoma cell injection, as indicated by seven (out of eight) significantly altered parameters (Fig. 6). This statement is also supported by a sustained recovery period after transmitter implantation (cf. Figs. 2 and 3).\nBoth interventions included laparotomy; however, the higher distress after transmitter implantation might be due to the second incision and implantation of the telemetric device, which weights 1.7\u202fg and is quite heavy for a mouse. Furthermore, the duration of surgical procedures (45 to 55\u202fmin for telemeter implantation versus 20\u202fmin for carcinoma cell injection) might influence distress in mice. Even anaesthesia alone without surgery is reported to provoke significant alterations of HR, BT, ACT and burrowing as well as nesting activity [18,51,52]. The measured read out parameters in this manuscript are, therefore, influenced by anesthesia, but also analgesia and surgical interventions or tumor growth. A distinction between distress caused by anaesthesia, analgesia or the surgical procedure was not made, since anesthesia and analgesia are mandatory. Another limitation is that it could not be clarified how much pain the mice experienced, since the distress parameters utilized are not specific for pain. In addition, animals with analgesia could not be compared to animals that did not receive analgesia because exploring distress without analgesia would cause unintentional suffering for the animals and is not in accordance with our animal welfare guidelines. However, in future studies, these sensitive distress parameters will be used to compare different analgesia methods after distinct interventions. According to the EU-Directive 2010\/63\/EU, Annex VIII [2], surgical interventions, including laparotomy and transmitter implantation, should be classified as \u201cmoderate\u201d severity. This rating is in line with our assessed distress score after both surgical interventions (total score 5\u201315: moderate distress [33]). After transmitter implantation, we observed a maximal body weight loss of 11.1%, which can be classified as moderate distress [53]. Additionally, seven parameters clearly indicated that transmitter implantation leads to more distress than laparotomy plus cancer cell injection (Fig. 6). It does not seem correct that both interventions have the identical severity classification. These data may suggest that more than 4 classes (non-recovery, mild, moderate and severe) or subclasses are necessary to generate a widely applicable system for the guidance of ethical review and monitoring of animal experiments.\nIn contrast to the surgical interventions, no distress was observed with the applied methods during cancer growth, although mice carried quite huge pancreatic tumours with an average weight of 494\u202fmg (standard deviation: \u00b1285\u202fmg) on day 37 after carcinoma cell injection. Since the tumour weight only minimally contributes to the measured body weight (mean: 1.43%, standard deviation: \u00b10.76%), the observed body weight gain of mice during the phase of tumor growth (mean: 2.79%, standard deviation: \u00b12.19%), is only partially caused by increased tumour weight, but is also caused by an increase of the actual body weight. However, it is well accepted that body weight change alone can be a poor distress indicator for tumour mouse models [43].\nThus, it can be suggested that tumour growth in this animal model causes mild distress. Consistent with the present data, similar minor alterations in burrowing behaviours, FCMs, nest building activity and body weight loss were observed upon repeated anaesthesia, which is also classified as a \u201cmild\u201d procedure [49,54]. Another interpretation could be that the utilized distress parameter might also not be sensitive enough to assess distress caused by the internal tumour growth.\nWhen comparing all read-out parameters, it was observed that distress score and burrowing activity exhibited the highest AUC for determining distress after cancer cell injection (AUC of parameters: distress-score\u202f>\u202fburrowing\u202f>\u202fHR\u202f>\u202fAct\u202f>\u202fBT\u202f>\u202fFCMs\u202f>\u202fbody weight change\u202f=\u202fnesting). Thus, distress score and burrowing behaviour indicated a better performance for distress determination than telemetric monitoring of HR, Act or BT. However, since the confidence intervals of all assessed parameters overlap, no distress parameter is significantly better for distress quantification. Therefore, all parameters are useful to quantify distress after laparotomy.\nA limitation of the clinical score is that it was initially developed to cover several murine gastrointestinal disease models, and its assessment is always influenced by the subjective perception of the researcher. However, this scoring system proved to be sensitive to detect distress after surgery but did not detect distress symptoms during tumour progression or recovery days (see Figs. 2A, 3A and 5A). Interestingly burrowing behaviour, as one objective distress indicator, showed higher AUC than the telemetric parameters, and the AUC of FCMs is comparable to BT and Act (Fig. 8).\nAnother limitation of our results section might be that the average HR, BT and Act was calculated only during the active phase in mice (dark phase, 7pm-7am). In order to address this issue, comparison of HR during the light phase (7am-7pm) with the dark phase (7pm-7am) was additionally provided for all interventions and the following recovery days (Fig. 9). In fact, more significant differences were observed during the light phase caused by lower baseline values of the resting heart rate. Moreover, telemetric parameters during the light phase were also influenced by the assessment of burrowing behaviour, as well as by disturbances of personnel in the animal facility. It was previously reported that an adequate assessment of HR by telemetry should always be performed in undisturbed animals [55]. Additionally, the AUC of measuring Act was lower during the light phase, when compared to the dark phase. (Fig. 10). Based on the above mentioned reasons, the light phase was intentionally not used for the assessment of telemetric parameters.\nIn addition, to the slightly reduced AUC for distress prediction after surgery, another disadvantage of using telemetry is the relatively high distress caused by transmitter implantation, which also demands a long recovery period. A recovery period of 2\u202fweeks after transmitter implantation was estimated, in accordance with other studies [27,50]. However, the time to fully regain body weight proved to be too short (Fig. 2C). Even 13\u202fdays after transmitter implantation, the body weight of mice was still reduced by 3%. Thus, a recovery period of greater than 2\u202fweeks can be recommended. Another disadvantage of telemetry is the expensive hardware, including receiver, matrix and transmitter and that surgical implantation of the transmitter should be performed by trained personnel with micro-surgical skills to minimize tissue trauma related distress [31]. These disadvantages might argue against using telemetry for distress assessment if other sensitive and non-invasive methods are applicable.\nHowever, one major benefit of telemetry is the high temporal resolution of data assessment. In particular, HR proved to be a very useful readout parameter for analysis after short time stressors. For example, handling, injection and cage changes increased HR for 30\u201370\u202fmin [24,27]. Such a short-term stress would be difficult to assess using behavioural methods. In addition, HR was reported to be a very sensitive indicator of stress, since not only direct stress induction but also just witnessing stress of other mice [56] or being singly housed increased HR [55]. Thus, telemetric analysis might provide valuable insight when analysing temporary or mild distress. Telemetric data acquisition is also helpful when quantifying stress induced alterations of circadian rhythm and sleep patterns [31,57]. Hence, there are some situations where distress analysis by telemetry might be very useful.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, this study revealed that non-invasive distress parameters, such as distress score and burrowing behaviour, had a slightly better performance than telemetric monitoring of HR, Act and BT in terms of distress assessment in a murine pancreatic cancer model. Considering the additional distress caused by transmitter implantation, the expensive hardware and required micro-surgical skills, the use of non-invasive parameters rather than telemetry can be recommended for evidence-based severity assessment.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nAll Institutional and National Guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.\n\n","67":"\n\nIntroduction\nEnergy resource exhaustion is among the most important challenges facing humankind, and the development of new energy sources has become urgent worldwide. H2, a safe, green, and environmentally friendly renewable energy source, is considered one of the best alternatives to fossil fuels in the future [1,2]. The production, purification, and storage of H2 have always attracted considerable research attention. Separation and purification techniques of H2 determine the application standards of H2 fuel [2\u20134]. To meet the industrial demand for high-purity H2, H2 purification is necessary. Currently, industrial methods for H2 recovery mainly include membrane separation, pressure-swing adsorption, and cryogenic separation [4,5]. Membrane separation is considered the most promising third-generation gas separation technology, after pressure-swing adsorption and cryogenic separation, because it is economical, convenient, efficient, and clean. Moreover, H2-selective metallic membranes have received much attention for purification. Although Pd-based metallic membranes are the most mature and widely used materials in current research, they are disadvantageous for large-scale production because they are high in cost [6]. Consequently, many researchers have searched for alternatives to reduce costs. Group VB metals (V, Nb, and Ta) have received significant attention because they show better hydrogen permeability, higher mechanical strengths, and lower costs than Pd-based metals [7,8].\nV, which has the highest H diffusion coefficient among group VB metals, is currently considered promising as a H2 separation material [5,9]. In addition, V and its alloys are not only considered important H2 storage materials with a large H capacity [8], but also candidate materials for the first walls and blankets of fusion reactors because of their excellent low activation characteristics under neutron irradiation, remarkable high-temperature performance, and swelling resistance under neutron radiation [10]. Until now, many researchers have performed many experiments and theoretical studies on V-based permeable membrane materials, mainly concentrating on the bulk [10\u201316]. For instance, a work by Dolan et al. showed that a Pd catalyst layer-coated 0.25\u202fmm V substrate membrane exhibited a high permeability under H2 permeation testing, especially at \u2265320\u202f\u00b0C, initially exceeding 3.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127\u202fmol\u202fm\u22121\u202fs\u22121\u202fPa\u22121\/2; the thick-walled membrane was self-supporting and pinhole-free [11]. Luo et al. [13] theorised that H atoms would preferentially occupy tetrahedral interstitial sites (TISs) for greater stability than that offered by octahedral interstitial sites (OISs) or substitutional sites; the corresponding formation energies of occupation were \u22120.374, \u22120.226, and +1.83\u202feV. A theory by Zhang et al. [10] and first-principles exploration by Gui et al. [14] of the trapping mechanism of H vacancies in solid V both showed that single H atoms preferentially occupy sites near the OIS instead of vacancy centre sites; in addition, mono-vacancy sites can trap as many as 12 H or six H2 species. Several fundamental aspects of the interaction between atoms or molecules and solid surfaces are not yet fully understood, such as the mechanism of surface-coverage adsorption.\nTo our knowledge, preparing clean V surfaces for experiments is difficult and time-consuming [6,17,18]. Studies in the literature that theoretically calculate the H behaviour on V surfaces are limited, despite the interactions between atoms or molecules and solid surfaces being of interest to several industries, especially in heterogeneous catalysis, gas corrosion, separation, and crystal growth [19\u201322]. Therefore, to provide further insight into the mechanism of H and metal interaction, the mechanisms of H permeation processes have been investigated in detail for metallic membranes.\nIn this study, we systematically studied the adsorption and diffusion properties of H atoms on the V surface by using first-principles methods. Specifically, all possible stable positions, diffusion energy barriers, and electronic properties of H atoms adsorbed on the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface were calculated [23\u201327], as well as the solution energy and diffusion energy barrier of H in bulk V. We also considered the calculation of adsorption structures from low coverage to high coverage. This work is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by which H atoms interact with metal surfaces; it provides a theoretical basis for further research on V-based alloys for H2 storage and H2 separation and purification applications.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nAll calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package code [28,29]. Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof generalised gradient approximation functions [30] and the projected augmented wave method [31,32] were used to treat the core\u2013electron interactions. V is a VB group transition metal element, and its valence electron structure with H is 3d34s2 and 1\u202fs1, respectively. The kinetic cut-off energy of 360\u202feV was applied to all systems. The Brillouin zone was sampled by a grid of k-points with the resolution 2\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.03\u202f\u00c5\u22121. During geometric optimisation, the energy difference tolerance was less than 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126\u202feV\u202fatom\u22121 and the force interacting on each atom was less than 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122\u202feV\u202f\u00c5\u22121. To search the minimum diffusion paths and transition states of the H atom, we employed the climbing image nudged-elastic-band (CI-NEB) method to calculate the H diffusion energy barriers between the optimised initial and final sites [33].\nTo optimise the computational cost and the accuracy of the DFT calculations, we built a seven-layer slab of the (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2) V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface with a vacuum region of 15\u202f\u00c5. Atoms in the upper three V layers were allowed to relax, while those in the bottom four layers were fixed at their bulk positions. The H atoms were placed at the top site (TS), bridge site (BS), and hollow site (HS) in the V surface. The TIS, OIS, and diagonal interstitial site (DIS) were considered for the diffusion of H atoms in the subsurface and bulk, for which 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, and 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 supercell models containing 16, 54, and 128\u202fV atoms, respectively, were built.\nThe change in the interlayer distance between the slab and bulk model is given by [27]\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u0394\nd\n=\n\n\n\nd\n\ni\n-\nj\n\n\n-\n\nd\n0\n\n\n\nd\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere d\n0 and di\u2013j\n are the interlayer distances between the ith and jth layers of the slab model before and after relaxation, respectively. Positive \u0394d indicates expansion between the layers, while negative \u0394d indicates contraction.\nThe surface energy \u03b3s is an important parameter for describing the basic properties of a metal surface, including the surface stability as well as physical and chemical reactions. A lower surface energy indicates better structural stability. It is defined as [34]\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03b3\nS\n\n=\n\n1\n\n2\nA\n\n\n\n(\n\nE\nS\n\nunrelax\n\n\n-\nN\n\nE\nb\n\n)\n\n+\n\n1\nA\n\n\n(\n\nE\nS\n\nrelax\n\n\n+\n\nE\nS\n\nunrelax\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere E\nunrelax\nS, E\nrelax\nS, E\nb, A, and N represent the total energy of the pre-relaxation model, total energy of the model after relaxation, bulk energy per atom, surface area of the cut surface structure, and number of atoms in the slab, respectively.\nThe average adsorption energy (E\nads) of H atoms is expressed as [6,27]\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nE\n\nads\n\n\nH\n2\n\n\n=\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\nslab\n+\nN\n(\n\nH\n2\n\n)\n\n\n-\n\nE\n\nslab\n\n\n-\nN\n\nE\n\nH\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nE\n\nads\n\nH\n\n=\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\nslab\n+\nN\n(\nH\n)\n\n\n-\n\nE\n\nslab\n\n\n-\nN\n\nE\nH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, E\nslab+H2\n and E\nslab+H are the total energies of the H2-adsorbed system, E\nslab is the total energy of the slab, N is the number of H2 molecules or H atoms adsorbed, and E\nH2\n and E\nH are the total energies of free H2 molecules and H atoms, respectively. Lower H molecular or atomic adsorption energies correspond to more stable adsorption positions.\nThe solution energy (E\nsol) of the interstitial H atom in bulk bcc V can be obtained as [9,10,13,14]\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nE\n\nsol\n\nH\n\n=\n\nE\n\nN\nV\n+\nH\n\n\n-\n\nE\n\nN\nV\n\n\n-\n\n1\n2\n\n\nE\n\nH\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere EN\n\nV+H and EN\n\nV are the total energies of the supercell with one H atom and no H atom, respectively. N represents the number of V atoms and E\nH2\n is the total energy of one H2 molecule.\nThe H diffusion coefficient is given by using the Arrhenius diffusion equation [9,19,22]:\n\n(6)\n\n\nD\n=\n\nD\n0\n\n\ne\nx\np\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\nE\na\n\n\nkT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere D\n0, E\n\na\n, T, and k are the pre-exponential factor, diffusion energy barrier (activation energy), absolute temperature, and Boltzmann constant, respectively.\nThe equilibrium H concentration is calculated according to Sieverts\u2019s law [9,19]:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\nC\nH\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\nP\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\nE\nS\n\nkT\n\n+\n\n\n\u0394\nS\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere P, P\n0, E\nS, \u0394S, T, and k denote the background pressure, reference pressure, solution energy, solution entropy, absolute temperature, and Boltzmann constant, respectively.\nTo determine the structural properties of bcc V, the equilibrium lattice constant was 2.996\u202f\u00c5 for bcc V, which agrees with other theoretical (2.998\u202f\u00c5) [35] and experimental (3.03\u202f\u00c5) [36] values. Moreover, the calculated elastic constants (C\n11\u202f=\u202f262.9, C\n12\u202f=\u202f136.7, and C\n44\u202f=\u202f38.7 GPa) and elastic moduli (B\u202f=\u202f178.8, E\u202f=\u202f130.0, and G\u202f=\u202f47.1 GPa) also agree with both experimental and theoretical results.\n\n\nResults and discussions\n\nSurface model\nTo obtain a reliable and stable surface, we selected the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface of four to nine atomic layers for geometric relaxation. The calculated changes in the interlayer relaxation and surface energies are listed in Table 1\n. It is seen that the change in the relaxation of the distance between the first and second atomic layer (\u03b4d1\u20132) values is greater, while the other layer distance changes are slightly weaker. The \u03b4d1\u20132 values are negative, indicating that the surface atomic layers are contracted, while the \u03b4d3\u20134 values excluding the five-slab model are positive, showing that the surface atomic layers are expanded. In addition to the surface energy of the seven-slab model agreeing with the experimental result, we observe that the surface energy of the other slab model tends to stabilise at 0.150\u202feV\/\u00c52 as the thickness of the slab increases in general; this is consistent with the calculated values [37]. Therefore, the seven-slab model can be utilised for further study. Because the H permeation process is not affected by periodicity, the interaction between adjacent surfaces must be eliminated; this is usually achieved by adding a vacuum layer. We tested a series of different thicknesses and found that a 15\u202f\u00c5 vacuum layer along the surface normal direction (Z-axis) meets our requirements. To summarise, a slab model of seven atomic layers with a 15\u202f\u00c5 vacuum layer is used for further research of the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface.\n\n\nAdsorption energy\nTo determine the stability of H atom adsorption sites in the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface, we investigated the possible adsorption sites of a single H atom, as shown in Fig. 1\n(a\u2013k). For the bcc metal (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface, H is mainly adsorbed at surface sites including the TS, BS, and HS. Additionally, H is mainly adsorbed at the first and second subsurface sites, such as the TIS, OIS, and DIS. The calculated absorption energies of the H atoms at these sites are presented in Table 2\n. It can be seen that the HS has a stronger absorption energy of \u22122.945\u202feV among all TSs, BSs, and HSs under a molecular layer (ML) surface coverage of 0.25; their vertical distances from the surface are 1.725, 1.228, and 0.564\u202f\u00c5, respectively, which implies that H prefers to adsorb at the HS. For the subsurface adsorption sites, we can see in Table 2 that TIS (1) has a minimum adsorption energy of \u22122.407\u202feV; those of TIS (2) and DIS (1) are respectively \u22122.275\u202feV and \u22122.214\u202feV; and that of OIS (1) is \u22122.065\u202feV; therefore, H is preferentially adsorbed at TIS (1). Similarly, TIS (3) shows a minimum adsorption energy in the second subsurface, which indicates that H-binding sites are energetically stable. In the analysis above, H atoms are most strongly attached to the surface compared to the first and second subsurfaces. In addition, our calculated values show consistency with those reported in the literature [38].\nWe further studied the interaction between H2 and the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface, where the initial configuration of H2 was first divided into vertical versus parallel to the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface. Fig. 1(l\u2013n) shows the adsorption model of the HS, which is labelled as a, b, and c states in our study. Based on the previous calculation results, the vertical distance of a single H atom adsorbed on the surface of V (1\u202f0\u202f0) is about 0.564\u20131.725\u202f\u00c5, so the distance between the centre of the H2 molecule at the initial position and the surface (d\nH2-surf) is set as 1.725\u202f\u00c5. The calculation results we obtained are presented in Table 3\n. The HH bond length (d\nH\u2013H) is \u223c0.751\u20130.753\u202f\u00c5, almost equal to our calculation for that of free H2 (0.75\u202f\u00c5), indicating that H2 is not dissociated and is adsorbed to the surface in molecular form. This is because the V atoms on the surface are very far away from H2 at this initial distance with only a weak interaction that does not break the H\u2013H bond. The vertical height between the H2 molecule and V surface is \u223c3.468\u20134.370\u202f\u00c5. Compared to the b and c states, molecular H2 is preferentially adsorbed at the TS, BS, and HS in the a state with corresponding adsorption energies of \u22120.001, \u22120.003, and \u22120.005\u202feV, respectively. This demonstrates that the interaction between H2 and the V surface is exothermic and that the adsorption energy of the HS is much smaller than those of the other sites, further indicating that H2 is more inclined to adsorb on the HS of the (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface. However, the TS shows the same adsorption energy of \u22120.001\u202feV for a molecule oriented in a parallel or perpendicular manner.\n\n\nElectronic properties\nTo investigate the electronic properties of H atom absorption at the TS, BS, and HS, we calculated the total density of states (TDOS) and the project density of states, as well as the charge density difference, as depicted in Fig. 2\n. Fig. 2(a) shows that the peak position of the TDOS and the splitting of the peak are significantly different after the adsorption of H atoms, and that the TDOS of H adsorption at different sites clearly varies. Significant hybridisation occurs between the H s and V d states, and the V s\/p\/d states overlap with the H s state below the Fermi level. In comparison to the TS and BS, the TS has a clear peak at \u22126 to \u22127.5\u202feV, indicating a strong chemical interaction between H and V atoms. Furthermore, we calculated the Z-direction planar-averaged charge density differences, as indicated in Fig. 2(b). The cyan and yellow regions mark areas of charge depletion and accumulation, respectively [39]. Charge redistribution largely occurs between the nearest-neighbour layer V atoms and the H atom interfacial region; at the bottom layer of the V atom, farther from the H atom, almost no charge change is observed. A positive value indicates electron accumulation, while a negative value indicates electron depletion [40]. Accordingly, the electrons are transferred from the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface side to the H-atom side. To quantify the change in charge density, we also employed Bader charge analysis, which showed that the H atoms at the TS, BS, and HS have 0.4757, 0.5507, and 0.5965 e, respectively. As far as we know, more negatively charged H atoms have lower energies [20]. This is why the H atom is adsorbed more stably at the TS than at the other sites.\n\n\nDissociation of H2 molecules\nIn order to study the case of the dissociation of H2 molecules on the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface, the above calculation results indicate that the vertical adsorption of H2 molecules is more stable than parallel adsorption; therefore we calculate the dissociation of the H2 molecule from the initial adsorption at the HS on the surface, as depicted in Fig. 3\n. As shown, the H2 molecule does not dissociate at the beginning of the HS. With gradual decreases in the vertical distance (d\nH2-surf) between the H2 molecule and surface, the HH bond begins to break. At a distance of 0.761\u202f\u00c5 from the surface, significant H bond fracture occurs, indicating that H2 dissociation depends on the initial distance of H2 from the surface. The bond length, dissociation energy, and vibration frequency of a single H2 molecule were calculated as 0.752\u202f\u00c5, 4.511\u202feV, and 4262\u202fcm\u22121, respectively, differing only slightly from both theoretical (respectively 0.751\u202f\u00c5, 4.51\u202feV, and 4266\u202fcm\u22121) and experimental (respectively 0.741\u202f\u00c5, 4.75\u202feV, and 4301\u202fcm\u22121) values [25,41]. Combining the adsorption energy of the H atom and H2 molecule calculated above, the undissociated H2 molecule is weakly physically adsorbed to the (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface, while the dissociated H atom is strongly chemically adsorbed. The physical adsorption energy of H2 is much larger than the chemical adsorption energy of H on the (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface, and the relaxed and stable position is significantly different from the surface height.\n\n\nDiffusion of H atoms\nWe studied the diffusion properties of H atoms on the V surface. H2 molecules at the surface of V (1\u202f0\u202f0) dissociate into H atoms that may diffuse either on the surface or from the surface to the subsurface, and then gradually into the interior. Using the CI-NEB method, the calculated H diffusion barrier energy is presented in Fig. 4\n. The number given in the figure indicates possible H diffusion paths. We first analyse Fig. 4(a), showing surface diffusion, and observe that the H diffusion barrier energy is 0.251\u202feV from the HS to BS, with further diffusion to the HS having a barrier energy of 0.132\u202feV. Thus, the total H diffusion barrier energy along the HS\u202f\u2192\u202fBS\u202f\u2192\u202fHS path is 0.383\u202feV. In addition, the H atom diffusing along the HS\u202f\u2192\u202fTS\u202f\u2192\u202fHS path has a diffusion barrier energy of 0.785\u202feV. These results indicate that the H atom preferentially diffuses along the HS\u202f\u2192\u202fBS\u202f\u2192\u202fHS path. Fig. 4(b) illustrates H diffusion from the surface to the first subsurface. Diffusion along the HS to TIS (1) requires an energy of 0.574\u202feV, while the diffusion barrier energy between the BS and TIS (1) is slightly smaller at 0.547\u202feV, indicating that the former path is unfavourable. We also analyse the case of diffusion from the first to second subsurface in Fig. 4(c). The diffusion barrier energies for TIS (1)\u202f\u2192\u202fTIS (3) through OIS (1) and TIS (1)\u202f\u2192\u202fTIS (2)\u202f\u2192\u202fTIS (3) are comparable at 0.464 and 0.348\u202feV, respectively, making the latter process energetically favourable. In conclusion, the optimal diffusion pathway for H atoms is 3\u202f\u2192\u202f6\u202f\u2192\u202f7 from the surface to the first subsurface to the second subsurface. This indicates that the decisive step of H atoms diffusing from the surface to subsurface is the passage through the surface of the first atomic layer. Once the H atom is below the surface, downward diffusion occurs easily. Moreover, deep diffusion of the H atom is likely to approach the diffusion energy barrier of the bulk.\n\n\nSurface coverage\nWe studied the effects of different surface coverage on the H adsorption energy. H coverage (\u03b8) is defined as the ratio of the number of adsorbed H atoms (or molecules) to the number of metal atoms in each layer of the surface, considering the different permutations of H adsorption configurations. Previous calculations indicate that H2 molecules are more stable when adsorbed vertically on the surface, so only the adsorption energy of vertical H2 molecules on the surface is calculated here. We calculated many average adsorption energies of H atoms and molecules at different sites with changes in 0.25\u202f<\u202f\u03b8\u202f\u2264\u202f1, and found that, under the same coverage of H atoms or molecules, the adsorption energy calculated at the same adsorption sites or equivalent sites is not significantly different and that H atoms or molecules are more stable at the HS. To understand the relationship between the H atoms or molecules and coverage, the minimum adsorption energy of stable configuration is given as a function of coverage, as plotted in Fig. 5\n(a, b). The adsorption energies of H atoms at the TS and BS gradually increase with increasing coverage from 0.25 to 1 ML, as indicated in Fig. 5(a). This may be attributed to electrostatic repulsion between atoms and an increased electrostatic energy, indicating the existence of repulsion between the adsorbed H atoms. The adsorption energy of H atoms adsorbed at the HS is unchanged with varying coverage, indicating that the interaction between the adsorbed H atoms is weak. Subsequently, we analyse the adsorption of H2 molecules. Fig. 5(b) shows that the adsorption energy of H2 decreases in the range of 0.25\u20130.5 ML and increases in the range of 0.5\u20131 ML, indicating that \u03b8\u202f\u2264\u202f0.50 ML facilitates adsorption at all three sites. For \u03b8\u202f>\u202f0.50 ML, that is, as the number of adsorbed H2 molecules increases, the stability of H molecular adsorption decreases.\n\n\nH dissolution and diffusion in bulk V\nThe last issue we considered was the solubility and diffusion properties of H atoms in the bulk. When metal reacts with H to form gap-type hydrides, H generally occupies the TIS, DIS, and OIS in metal lattices. The calculated solution energy (E\nsol) of H atoms in the TIS, DIS, and OIS is \u22120.346, \u22120.238, and \u22120.165\u202feV for V16H, \u22120.371, \u22120.336, and \u22120.228\u202feV for V54H, and \u22120.41, \u22120.336, and \u22120.284\u202feV for V128H, respectively. Our calculations are well matched to the reference values [5,14,21,22]. The E\nsol value of the TIS is much lower than those of the DIS and OIS within the entire H concentration range, implying that the most stable configuration is the TIS. Fig. 5(c) shows E\nsol of the V\u2013H system depending slightly on the H concentration. The E\nsol values of the TIS, DIS, and OIS generally increase with H concentration, indicating that the V\u2013H system is energetically unfavourable. We then analysed H solubility, which is critical in determining the recombination rate coefficient and is directly related to the capture and bubbling of H, as illustrated in Fig. 5(d). The concentration of H decreases as the temperature increases, indicating that the dissolution of H in V is exothermic. Moreover, H has a high concentration at room temperature, directly leading to the accumulation of H atoms at defects followed by precipitation to form H2, causing the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement in the metal. Suzuki et al. reported that a sharp ductile-to-brittle transition occurred at \u223c0.2\u20130.25 H\/M for V membranes [15].\nH diffusion follows two different paths among neighbour TISs, as shown in Fig. 6\n. On the first path, H atoms diffuse through a DIS (see Fig. 6(a)), while on the second path, they diffuse through an OIS (Fig. 6(b)). The preferred H diffusion pathway is the first path, which is more energetically favourable than the second path. The diffusion barrier first decreases and then increases with H concentration. In addition, both the DIS and OIS are second-order saddle points on the potential energy surface. Sorescu et al. also proved such a case occurring in bcc bulk Fe [26]. Consequently, H diffusion mainly occurs between adjacent TISs. We further discussed the diffusion coefficient of H, which measures the ability of H atoms to diffuse across a metallic membrane. To match the experimental components and enable comparison [4,7], we chose to study the diffusion coefficient of H in the V16H phase using the Arrhenius diffusion equation [42,43], as illustrated in Fig. 6(c). At an operating temperature of 673\u202fK, the value is 1.73\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22128\u202fm2\u202fs\u22121, unlike the existing experimental and calculated values of 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22128\n[7] and 1.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22128\u202fm2\u202fs\u22121\n[4], respectively. This may arise from differences in calculations and experiments, especially in the activation barrier of H. In addition, the diffusivity increases with temperature.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, we have employed a combination of first-principles methods and empirical theory to study the adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion properties of H on the V (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface and in the bulk. Our calculation results indicate that the most stable adsorption configuration with different coverages of H atoms and molecules on the surface is the HS. Specifically, the HS is the most thermodynamically stable site for H atom adsorption, with an almost constant adsorption energy at 0.25\u20131 ML coverage. H2 molecules tend to become adsorbed vertically at the HS on the surface, showing a very weak physical adsorption state. With increasing coverage, the adsorption energy first decreases and then decreases. In addition, H2 molecules gradually dissociate into H atoms as they approach the surface. The diffusion of H atoms on the surface, from the surface to the first subsurface, and from the first subsurface to the second subsurface, optimally occurs via the paths of HS\u202f\u2192\u202fBS\u202f\u2192\u202fHS, BS\u202f\u2192\u202fBS, and BS\u202f\u2192\u202fTIS\u202f\u2192\u202fBS, respectively. For the bulk, we find that H atoms occupy the most stable TIS and diffuse along adjacent TISs. At the operating temperature of 673\u202fK, the H diffusion coefficient is 1.73\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22128\u202fm2\u202fs\u22121 for V16H. This study is important for the next step of alloying element doping, regulation, and Pd plating to obtain better H permeability in membrane metals.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","68":"\n\nIntroduction\nEmploying treadmill training in gait rehabilitation can be of significant help in achieving functional ambulation in patients with neurological damage, including stroke. In fact, treadmill training augments the ability to walk independently of patients with stroke, although in the short term, and provide them with higher walking speed and walking endurance as compared to traditional overground gait training. These effects are magnified further when coupling treadmill training with BWS (body weight\u2013supported treadmill training - BWSTT) [1\u20136]. Indeed, BWSTT can alleviate post-stroke survivors\u2019 weight bearing and effort (and physiotherapist\u2019s effort) during gait training, allowing the patient to walk when muscle strength and postural control are still non-sufficient for functional ambulation. Consequently, they may allow for mobilization and training early [7,8]. Last, BWSTT is useful because it provides for walking with reduced ground reaction forces and normal ranges of motion of lower limb joints [9]. Altogether, these aspects of BWSTT may facilitate the improvement in qualitative and quantitative gait indices, although controversial data is available [6,10\u201319]. However, some innovative BWSTTs give the patient a from-below lifting force by employing lower body positive pressure support system (LBPPSS). These systems implement differential air pressure technology using a chamber to reduce the weight of an individual while walking up to 100% of the original body weight, instead of using a body-suspension harness system.\nLBPPSS is increasingly used after knee surgery to reduce ground reaction forces during walking and running to facilitate postoperative rehabilitation [20,21]. It has also been successfully employed in children with cerebral palsy [22]. Conversely, there are no data on LBPPSS usefulness in post-stroke rehabilitation. There are several issues to be although considered before employing LBPPSS in post-stroke patients. The use of LBPPSS may be relatively contraindicated in such patients, given that LBPP can affect systemic blood pressure and cerebral blood flow [23]. Further, whether LBPPSS can affect kinematic (including spatiotemporal variables) and kinetic parameters of gait still has to be clearly determined [23\u201334]. In fact, LBPP may generate unwanted horizontal assistance due to the interface between the chamber and the subject, thus irregularly modifying locomotion kinematics and kinetics [25]. In addition, there is no clear correlation between BWS and the results of ground-reaction forces during overground walking with different percentages of BWS [29,30]. Moreover, LBPP would influence only the stance phase. In fact, the swinging limb remains subject to full gravity given that it cannot be pulled in proportion to the simulated gravity level [35]. Therefore, muscle activity decreases as BWS increases without, however, any proportionality [35]. Finally, the metabolic cost of BWS has still to be clearly determined [36,37].\nTo synthesize, the effects of LBPPSS on gait kinematic variables could be neither predictable nor necessarily useful to recovering functional gait in post-stroke patients. Indeed, whether improvements in temporal variables of gait correspond to progress in functional gait is unknown. This study was aimed at offering a preliminary estimation of the safety and the effectiveness of the LBPPS AlterG (AlterG Inc.; Fremont, CA, USA) on temporal variables of gait and on functional ambulation measures in a sample of patients with hemiparesis due to stroke in the chronic phase. The hypothesis was that LBPPSS would significantly improve functional gait in comparison to conventional treadmill gait training (TGT) thanks to specific, gait phase-related, changes in temporal variables of gait and muscle activations.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nExperimental procedure\nThe study was designed as a single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the effects of LBPPSS (provided using AlterG) and TGT in patients with stroke. Clinical and gait data of the patients were compared with those of 25 age-matched (by a frequency-matching approach) healthy controls (HC).\n\n\nParticipants\nFifty patients among the 250 attending the Robotic Neurorehabilitation Unit of the institute in 2018 were enrolled in the study according to the following inclusion criteria: (i) age\u202f\u2265\u202f55\u202fyears; (ii) first, single, ischemic supra-tentorial stroke occurred at least 6\u202fmonths before study inclusion; (iii) a Functional Ambulatory Categories (FAC) score of\u202f\u2265\u202f2; (iv) the ability to control head and trunk posture; (v) no systemic or cardiovascular contraindication to LBPP; and (vi) the ability to give personal consent, understand instructions and learn through practice (Abbreviated Mental Test\u202f>\u202f7\/10). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) recurrent stroke; (ii) recent brain surgery; (iii) spasticity of modified Ashworth scale greater than 3; (iv) fixed contracture of any lower limb joint or painful joints; (v) ataxia, dystonia, or tremor of lower limbs; (vi) cervical myelopathy; (vi) severe aphasia; and (vii) a history of seizures in the past 12\u202fmonths. The study also included a sample of 25 HC (i.e., without any evidence of neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, orthopedic, or systemic disease). The institutional review board approved the study (IRCCSME#19\/17); all participants gave their written informed consent to study inclusion.\n\n\nIntervention\nPatients were randomized into two groups (with a 1:1 allocation ratio). A group practiced one session a day of AlterG (for 40\u202fmin), six days a week, for four weeks (for a total amount of 24 sessions). The other group practiced one session a day of TGT (for 40\u202fmin), six days a week, for four weeks (for a total amount of 24 sessions). HCs were provided with one session a day of AlterG (for 40\u202fmin), six days a week, for four weeks (for a total amount of 24 sessions).\nThe LBPPSS AlterG consists of a treadmill with handrails equipped with a waist-high inflatable chamber. The subject wears neoprene shorts that zip into the chamber, creating an airtight seal around the subject's waist. During training, positive pressure inflates the chamber, and the difference in pressure around the waist seal produces a lifting force [26]. The LBPP makes the patient feel more comfortable than overhead harness systems to support body weight, and it allows for a kinematic walking pattern similar to overground walking. The subject can walk freely or use the handrails of the treadmill, with physiotherapist supervision.\nThe patients undergoing AlterG were trained with the assistance\/supervision of a trained physiotherapist depending on the patient\u2019s FAC score (FAC 2: to walk with the intermittent support of one physiotherapist to help with balance and coordination; FAC 3: to walk with the visual supervision of one physiotherapist; FAC 4: to walk independently without using the handrails). BWS, physiotherapist assistance, and treadmill speed (TS) were checked and adapted to subjects\u2019 progress in terms of FAC scoring across the AlterG sessions. Also, the participants who practiced TGT were trained using a FAC-tailored approach. The HC initially practiced the AlterG at the same amount of BWS and TS administered to the patients. BWS and TS were reduced and increased, respectively, in pre-established steps across the AlterG sessions. It was necessary to provide also HC with LBPP to have a better reference value, given that even healthy people can display normal variations from the normal pattern of walking.\n\n\nOutcomes\nAll outcome measures were obtained the day before and the day after the training, so to avoid any interference on the training and biasing effect of fatigue. The primary outcome was the FAC score for the qualitative gait assessment. FAC is a 6-point scale (rating from 0 to 5) that evaluates ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of assistive device use. A score of zero indicates that the patient cannot walk (non-functional ambulation); a score of one denotes a dependent ambulator who requires assistance from another person in the form of continuous manual contact; a score of two indicates continuous or intermittent manual contact; a score of 3 verbal indicates supervision\/guarding. Scores of four and five describe patients who can walk freely only on level surfaces or on any surface, respectively (independent ambulation).\nThe secondary outcomes were the temporal parameters of gait and the dynamic electromyography data. Specifically, the gait cycle features and muscle activation were quantified while the participant walked overground using an eight-channel wireless system (FreeEMG1000 system; BTS Bioengineering, Milan, Italy) equipped with an accelerometer (G-Sensor). As outcome measures, the step time (i.e., the time between the heel strike of one leg and the heel strike of the contralateral leg), the stance\/swing ratio (SSR, that is, the ratio between swing time -the time during which the foot is not in contact with the floor- and stance time -the time during which the foot is in contact with the floor), the cadence (i.e., the number of steps per second), and the Gait Quality Index (GQI, which estimates the overall deviation from the average gait of a control population by using the temporal parameters) were quantified [38,39].\nThe duration of the gait cycle was normalized to 100% to calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of each muscle (a temporal parameter estimating muscle activation), so to make the comparisons among conditions and subjects possible. Thus, the mean RMS was computed by averaging 10 RMS values related to 10% partitions of the gait cycle across the subjects. We also computed the overall RMS over the entire walking trial without partitioning. All of these measurements were corrected for the Froude number (Fr) to normalize for differences in dynamic behavior. Fr is calculated as the ratio of the square of the TS to the length of the lower limb (L) from the greater trochanter to the ground, and the acceleration due to gravity (g), according to the formula TS2\/(g\u202f\u00d7\u202fL) [40].\nSurface myoelectric signals were sampled at 1000\u202fHz from rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius medialis (G) of both lower limbs. After careful preparation of the skin, the bipolar adhesive surface electrodes were placed over the muscle belly in the direction of the muscle fibers according to the European recommendations for surface electromyography (SENIAM). This was done to ensure repeatable electrode placement during the training [41\u201343]. Meanwhile, the EMG signals were processed to obtaining RMS values using Smart Analyzer software v.1.10.469.0 (BTS Bioengineering; Milan, Italy), so to investigate lower limb muscle activation as modified by training interventions [44].\n\n\nSample size, randomization, blinding\nTwenty patients per arm would have been required to observe a minimum median improvement (\u00b1IQR) of +1(1) scale-point for the FAC [45], with \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.05 and 1\u202f\u2212\u202f\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.8. Twenty-five patients were thus recruited per arm to allow for dropouts.\nThe randomization procedures were carried out thanks to a computer-generated list covered by straps to conceal the allocation.\nThe experimenters who assessed the patients and analyzed the data were blind on patients\u2019 allocation.\n\n\nStatistical methods\nAll data were described quantitatively using median (with IQR) and mean (with standard deviation) where appropriate. Clinical data changes over time were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. A Bonferroni adjustment for the two time points was made (\u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.025). Between-group comparison was carried out using the Mann-Whitney test.\nThe secondary outcomes were assessed using a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) to reduce the probability of type I error owing to multiple comparisons [46]. Post-hoc analysis with univariate 3-way ANCOVA with the factors time (two levels: before and after the training), lower-limb (three levels for group\u202f\u00d7\u202flower-limb\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime data analysis: affected, unaffected, and healthy limbs; datasets related to healthy limbs were pooled together; and two levels for lower-limb\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime data analysis: affected vs. unaffected in the patients, or left vs. right in HC), and group (three levels: AlterG, TGT, and HC) was used to indicate which temporal measure showed significant changes.\nConcerning RMS, the average EMG data from each 10% partition of the entire gait cycle in each muscle and the overall RMS of the entire gait cycle in each muscle were analyzed using a univariate 2-way ANCOVA with the factors time (two levels: before and after the training) and group (three levels: AlterG, TGT, and HC).\nClinical and demographic characteristics (age, gender, affected side, and disease duration) and comorbidities (Table 1\n) were added to the analysis as covariates. The effect size (E) of each outcome measure was defined as small (<0.41), medium (0.41 to 0.70), or large (>0.70) to estimate the effect of the AlterG treatment. An \u03b1-level of P\u202f<\u202f0.05 was assumed to be significant, and the Bonferroni correction was then used for post-hoc comparisons. With regard to the factor lower-limb, datasets related to healthy limbs and affected\/unaffected limbs were pooled in separate sessions to compare the affected and unaffected sides of patients and to compare the affected and unaffected side of patients to the healthy limbs [47,48]. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the strength of correlation between TS, BWS, and peak muscle activation.\n\n\n\nResults\nAt baseline, all patients required a degree of assistance from the physiotherapist while walking corresponding to an FAC of 3 (IRQ 2\u20134). Patients showed a lower cadence in comparison to HC (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Moreover, a longer step time with the affected side and a shorter step time with the unaffected limb were appreciable (lower limb comparison, P\u202f<\u202f0.001; each patient\u2019s lower limb in comparison to HC, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). This was paralleled by a lower SSR in the affected lower limb and a higher SSR in the unaffected limb (lower limb comparison, P\u202f<\u202f0.001; each patient\u2019s lower limb in comparison to HC, P\u202f=\u202f0.01). The mildness of SSR changes in comparison to HC depended on the fact that the percent gait cycle duration was longer in the patients with stroke compared to HC. Last, patients showed a lower GQI in both lower limbs (lower limb comparison, P\u202f<\u202f0.001; each patient\u2019s lower limb in comparison to HC, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 2\n\n). There were no significant differences between TGT and AlterG groups, as well as no pair-wise lower limbs differences were appreciable between the patient groups. HC showed ho significant inter-limb differences. Both groups had a lower activity of the affected TA and BF, a higher activity of the affected G in the 20, 30, 40, and 50% of the gait cycle, and a higher activity of the affected RF in the 50, 60, and 70% of the gait cycle, as compared to HC (each comparison P\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 3\n). On average, the patients who practiced AlterG required a BWS of 65\u202f\u00b1\u202f10% and a TS of 0.53\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fm\/s at the beginning of the training (Fig. 2). HCs were provided with the same amount of BWS and TS.\nAll enrolled participants completed the trial, without reporting any side effects or adverse events (Fig. 1).\nBWS was progressively scaled down to 30\u202f\u00b1\u202f10% in patients provided with AlterG, whereas FAC was adapted to the subject\u2019s need during TGT. TS was progressively scaled up to 1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fm\/s in patients undergoing AlterG, and 0.79\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fm\/s in patients undergoing TGT. Indeed, post-training FAC increased by at least one scale-point in both AlterG and TGT groups without significant between-group differences (Fig. 2, Table 2\n). BWS and TS in the HC group were instead progressively scaled down to 0% in daily steps of 3%, and scaled up to 1.73\u202fm\/s, in daily steps of 0.05\u202fm\/s (Fig. 2).\nCadence increased more evidently after the AlterG training compared to TGT (Fig. 2, Table 2). GQI increased more evidently and in both lower limbs after the AlterG training compared to TGT, which instead showed a significant inter-limb difference (Fig. 2, Table 2). Step time and SSR partially reverted the baseline trend. Specifically, these parameters varied more evidently and in both lower limbs after the AlterG training compared to TGT, which also yielded a significant inter-limb difference (Fig. 2, Table 2).\nHC did not show any significant change in gait features following AlterG training (Fig. 2, Table 2). Each lower-limb and group comparison over time between the patient groups and the HCs was thus significant.\nThe treatments yielded significant effects on the target muscles. Specifically, AlterG in patients decreased the RMS in the 50, 60, and 70% of gait cycle in both G and both RF (Fig. 4\n), with comparable statistical data among these 10% partitions (Table 3\n). On the other hand, AlterG increased the RMS in the 70, 80, 90, and 100% of the gait cycle in the unaffected TA (Fig. 4), with comparable statistical data among these 10% partitions (Table 3). AlterG also increased the overall RMS more than AlterG in HC and TGT did; moreover, AlterG in HC and TGT yielded only an overall RMS increase. Statistical data are summarized in Table 3.\nNotably, it was observed that foot motion quickly recovered the shape and the step reproducibility (that characterizes normal gait) at the end of each AlterG session in the HC, whereas this was not the case of the patients who were provided with AlterG training.\nLast, there were no significant effects of clinical-demographic characteristics on gait outcomes.\n\n\nDiscussion\nBoth AlterG gait training and TGT provided patients with an FAC improvement of at least one point. However, as the main finding of the present study, AlterG gait training was superior to TGT in modifying the temporal variables of gait and specific muscular activation patterns. In fact, AlterG yielded a greater TS increase, cadence increase, step time decrease in the affected limb, step time increase in the unaffected limb, SSR increase in the affected limb, SSR decrease in the unaffected limb, and GQI increase (i.e., a smaller overall deviation from the average gait of a control population). Moreover, AlterG in patients targeted equally the temporal variables of the gait of both the lower limbs, whereas TGT offered more effects on the affected than the unaffected lower limb. Furthermore, AlterG induced muscle-specific (both G, both RF, and unaffected TA) and gait cycle specific (mid- and late-stance) nonlinear scaling of muscle activity as compared to TGT, with particular regard to antigravity muscles. TGT instead improved only overall muscle activation. Concerning HC, AlterG barely modified the gait cycle features and had effects on muscle activity that were limited to the overall muscle activation.\nHence, even though the patients who practiced AlterG walked as independently as the patients provided with TGT, the former treatment provided the patients walking faster, with a kinematic walking pattern closer to normal overground walking, and with more symmetric temporal variables of gait as compared to the latter treatment. These goals are not of negligible importance, as it is crucial in gait rehabilitation to provide the patient with both independent and performing gait [49].\nAs far as we know, this is the first study investigating the effects of LBPPSS training on temporal variables of gait in people with chronic stroke. Therefore, we can discuss our findings in comparison with those coming from other BWSTs and TGT. It has been reported that there are no significant differences between BWSTT and TGT in the patients with chronic phase of stroke with at least moderate initial ambulatory status (as in our study) [6,50]. However, LBPPSS differs from the other BWSTs in at least two aspects: (1) the distribution of suspension forces on the body; and (2) the action of the suspension forces on both standing and swinging limb [51]. The first aspect depends on the device itself. Indeed, the other BWS devices employed to suspend patient\u2019s weight during walking rehabilitation (including water immersion, parallel bars and walker, hand-held waist belts, and overhead suspension harness) are not characterized by the same correlation between the suspension force and the waist cross-sectional area, which accounts for the overall lifting force, and employ a from-above lifting force. The second aspect is suggested by the gathering of muscle activity changes in the mid- and late-stance phases of the gait cycle, as pointed out by our EMG data, whereas the other suspension devices seems to not allow for this activity [51]. This finding is suggestive of a correlation between AlterG-induced symmetric improvement of temporal variables of gait and the specific, more symmetric, support to the stance phase and swing initiation by part of LBPP. In particular, AlterG shaped RF and G muscles, which are central to opposing to gravity force [52]. Having bilaterally rebalanced the activation of G may have been important in gait improvement given that G acts as either a propulsive muscle during walking (by providing hip extension during the stance phase) or a muscle that prevents the foot from hitting the ground (by creating a flexion of the knee during the swing phase) [51]. Lastly, AlterG targeted unaffected TA. This is at first glance unusual, given that TA should remain relatively unaffected by the from-below, vertical force created by the LBPPSS [51]. Thus, it is likely that targeting unaffected TA resulted in a compensatory effect to establish a more stable gait dynamic, i.e., avoiding a rapid plantar flexion of the ankle during the initial stance to ensure that the forefoot clears the ground during the swing phase and positioning the ankle joint for initial ground contact. These effects also contributed to favor a more symmetric gait [53].\nFurther, the specific effects on muscle activation by AlterG in patients may be due to the progressive increase in gait velocity at lower biomechanical demand and higher dimensionless speeds [54\u201357]. About that, it has been documented that increasing the speed of running while tuning the degree of LBPP seems to augment the overall locomotor muscle activity [58]. Lastly, AlterG allows patients to vary bodily posture during gait, which may have influenced lower limb muscle activation [56,57].\nAltogether, these issues may lead to a more physiologic gait pattern as compared to other non-harness BWS system (e.g., hydrotherapy) [51,59]. Since the upward resultant air pressure force acts at or near the body\u2019s center of mass, walking in the device will result in a more normal gait but with proportionally reduced musculoskeletal forces [51,59].\nHC were nearly insensitive to the training as compared to patients. This may depend on the more unstable spatiotemporal structure of locomotion in stroke survivors, owing to the increase of compensatory oscillating circuits driving the muscles to produce locomotion [56,57]. Thus, weight-relief may have allowed a more efficient reshape of rhythmogenesis at the level of spinal central pattern generators receiving a deteriorated corticospinal drive [17,60\u201365] and, even, at the central level [66].\n\nLimitations\nOther factors may come into play when dealing with LBPP, thus limiting the large-scale applicability of LBPP training. These include task-dependent features, individual compensatory strategies, and plasticity of gait-related brain and spinal networks. In addition, different levels of weight relief were not compared, selecting the most suitable level of BWS for the patient instead. Further, it is still unclear whether the effect of a therapist\u2019s supervision may mitigate (or remove completely) an incorrect performance of the training, which obviously represents a confounding factor. Hence, further studies are needed to clarify the role of LBPP in gait training. Last, it will be necessary to ascertain whether AlterG aftereffects are long lasting with an adequate follow-up period.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nThe application of LBPP to treadmill-based gait training seems promising in post-stroke rehabilitation. In fact, LBPPSS resulted in walking faster, large changes in the temporal walking kinematics, an improvement in functional ambulation, and a better muscle activation pattern, with particular regard to antigravity muscles as compared to TGT. However, LBPPSS has complex effects on neuromuscular activation, with non-proportional changes in body weight and muscle activity. Thus, other studies are necessary to confirm our promising findings. The knowledge of the exact gait pattern during BWSTT will be central to plan patient-tailored locomotor training. For example, the correlation between RF, G, and TA forces and gait features allows for achieving more precisely gait kinematics and kinetics during rehabilitation.\n\n\nEthical approval\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and\/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

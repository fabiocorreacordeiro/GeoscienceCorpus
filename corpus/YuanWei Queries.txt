Dear Fabio

 

After searching on Elsevier Science Direct, I have selected the following queries.
The domain of the query is getting larger from top to bottom.
About the abstract numbers, I am not sure. 500? Maybe for the first three domains, we do 800? 

Please have a look at these queries :D, to see if you agree with the format and selections. The domain: Everything English is not included. I will leave this to you since you are not in the Geo domain. It selected by your sounds reasonable.

Best regards
Yuanwei

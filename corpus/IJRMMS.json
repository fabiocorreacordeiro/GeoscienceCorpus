via laboratory tests using core samples. However, sample coring is time consuming and expensive. The longitudinal wave velocity in rock bolts embedded in a rock mass depends on the surrounding rock properties. Hence, the longitudinal wave velocity in rock bolts can be utilized to predict rock properties. This study presents the relationship between granite rock properties and longitudinal wave velocity (v\n                     L) in rock bolts to predict rock properties using the longitudinal wave velocity in a rock bolt. Chemical (saline solution) and mechanical (slake durability test) weathering processes are employed to diversify the properties of the rock specimens. Laboratory tests are conducted on rock specimens to measure the physico-mechanical rock properties, including the velocities (v\n                     p and v\n                     s) associated with constrained and shear moduli, density (\u03c1), Young's modulus (E), Poisson's ratio (\u03bc), and porosity (\u03b7), compressive strength (f\n                     c), and slake durability index (SDI). The measured rock properties are used in the rock mass model, and variations in v\n                     L in the rock bolt with different properties are investigated via numerical simulations. Results show that v\n                     p, v\n                     s, \u03c1, E, and f\n                     c are correlated significantly with v\n                     L (R\n                     2\u00a0>\u00a00.9), whereas \u03b7 and SDI are moderately correlated with v\n                     L (R\n                     2\u00a0>\u00a00.7). However, a meaningful correlation between \u03bc and v\n                     L is not obtained. The root mean square and mean absolute percentage errors are estimated to validate the correlation equations, and errors are not considered. Results of the t-test show that the calculated t-value is higher than the critical t-value, and the p-value is smaller than the significance level of 0.05, indicating that the correlation coefficient is significant. This study shows that the velocity of longitudinal waves in a rock bolt can be a useful indicator for predicting in-situ rock properties.\n               ","1":"\n                  As the coal mining goes deeper, strong mining induced tremors frequently occur, which seriously threaten the safety of underground miners and ground residents, as well as the productivity and effectiveness of mining activities. The deep-hole blasting technology is expected to weaken or fracture the roof, thereby reducing the risk of strong mine tremors. However, the effectiveness of this technology lacks systematic study. This paper investigates the characteristics of mine tremors and stress distribution before and after deep-hole blasting during the mining process in Dongtan coal mine in Shandong province, China, and reveals the effect of deep-hole blasting in preventing and controlling strong mine tremors. After the deep-hole blasting, the energy and spatial distribution of the mine tremors change greatly. The energy of small mine tremors increases by an order of magnitude, but large-energy mine tremors (hazardous mine tremors) are basically eliminated. Combined with the results of stress monitoring, the deep-hole blasting technology could effectively weaken and fracture the thick-and-hard strata overlying the coal seam, so as to achieve the purpose of discharging strain energy in overlying rock. The implementation of deep-hole blasting technology will not eliminate mine tremors, but it could reduce or eliminate the strong mine tremors caused by the instantaneous fracturing of the large-scale suspended roof.\n               ","2":"\n                  Many physical processes in the field of rock physics are influenced by the presence of fractures and microcracks. Therefore, intact rock samples are often used for reproducible experimental studies, and cracks are artificially created by various methods. For this, one possibility is the use of thermal treatments. In this work, twelve different thermal treatments are experimentally studied for dry Bianco Carrara marble under ambient conditions. The focus is primarily on the influence of the cooling rate (slow versus fast cooling) in combination with different applied maximum temperatures. This also raises the question of the influence of the specimen size, which has never been systematically investigated in this context before. Therefore, three sizes of cylindrical core samples are investigated to identify a potential specimen size effect. As effective quantities on the core-scale, the bulk volume, the bulk density, and the P- and S-wave velocities, including shear wave splitting, are examined. To obtain a three-dimensional insight into the mechanisms occurring on the micro-scale level, micro X-ray Computed Tomography (\n                        \u03bc\n                     XRCT) imaging is employed. For both cooling conditions, with increasing maximum temperature, the bulk volume increases, the propagation velocities significantly drop, and shear wave splitting increases. This behavior is amplified for fast cooling. The bulk volume increase is related to the initiated crack volume as \n                        \u03bc\n                     XRCT shows. Based on comprehensive measurements, a logarithmic relationship between the relative bulk volume change and the relative change of the ultrasound velocities can be observed. Although there is a size effect for fast cooling, the relationship found is independent of the specimen size. Also the cooling protocol has almost no influence. A model is derived which predicts the relative change of the ultrasound velocities depending on the initiated relative bulk volume change.\n               ","3":"\n                  We present an approach of identifying anisotropy axes and the type of symmetry from ultrasonic measurements of 21 elastic constants of the complete stiffness tensor characterizing anisotropic materials. The approach is applied to examine anisotropic elasticity of two crystalline rock samples from two underground research laboratories: (1) the migmatized gneiss from Bukov in the Czech Republic; and (2) the Aare Granite from Grimsel in Switzerland. The full stiffness matrix is measured at selected pressure levels from 0.1 to 100\u00a0MPa. We demonstrate that the Bukov migmatized gneiss is orthorhombic, whereas the Grimsel granite is transversely isotropic under atmospheric pressure. The degree of anisotropy of both rocks decreases with applied confining pressure due to closing of preferentially oriented cracks. While the Grimsel granite is very sensitive to pressure and becomes almost isotropic at high pressures, a great portion of anisotropy in the Bukov migmatized gneiss remains even under high pressures due to its texture. The dependence of Young's and shear moduli with pressure emphasizes the importance of taking the pressure into account for underground projects.\n               ","4":"\n                  Energy-absorbing anchor bolts are widely used in geotechnical engineering, but there is no effective numerical simulation approach for evaluating them at the engineering application level.

The curve of the shear stress with shear displacement can be divided into six stages, i.e., initial nonlinear compression-shear deformation, compression-shear deformation of approximate linear elasticity, cyclic shear cumulative damage deformation, compression-shear deformation with slowly rising stress, compression-shear deformation with sharply rising stress and compression-shear deformation of brittle stress drop. The peak (residual) shear strength and cumulative shear (normal) displacement decrease and increase, respectively, with number of cyclic shear increasing under the same moisture content, normal stress, shear rate, shear amplitude or first-order asperity angle; under the same number of cyclic shear, these increase and decrease, respectively, with normal stress or first-order asperity angle increasing, while these decrease and increase, respectively, with moisture content, shear rate or shear amplitude increasing.

To explore the dynamic shear deformation behaviors of rock joints, an impact-induced direct shear test applicable for jointed rock specimen is conducted. A biaxial Hopkinson pressure bar (BHPB) equipment is employed, which can simulate intensive disturbances encountered during engineering construction in rock masses. Tangential and normal dynamic stresses on rock joint can be measured simultaneously through stress wave acquisition. Dynamic displacements are obtained based on a two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) technique. Firstly, the feasibility of the experimental method is verified by trial tests on metallic specimens. The measurement technique for obtaining the dynamic stress and displacement of joint is proposed. Then, a series of dynamic shear experiments are carried out on jointed and intact granite specimens, respectively. The dynamic shear deformation of the specimens is obtained, and the effects and mechanisms of undulating angle and initial normal stress on the dynamic shear deformation are discussed. The test results show that, due to the variable input force and normal stress, the shear rate varies. The dynamic slip of the joint can be divided into three sub-stages: slip initiation, secondary stress accumulation, and post-slip. The shearing process of intact rock includes two stages: shear stress accumulation and post-peak damage. Deformation rebounding is also observed in the jointed and intact granite specimens. The maximum shear displacement is negatively correlated with the normal stress and the undulating angle.

The thermally treated samples were tested at 5\u201315\u00a0kHz loading frequencies as per the ASTM-C215.

Mudstones with high calcium carbonate contents are common but have received little attention in micromechanical studies. Using the Eagle Ford formation as an example, we present a new conceptual framework for micromechanical modelling calcareous mudstones, with the aim of predicting the macroscopic elastic response of mudstones to address gaps left by limited core-scale data. The model accounts for the microstructural differences with argillaceous mudstones and implement it in a mean-field homogenisation framework. This allows us to model elastic stiffness from the scale of microcrystalline calcite up to the scale of the undamaged poro-mineralogical skeleton. We present results of a comprehensive micromechanical characterisation of the Eagle Ford, adding to the data available for calcareous mudstones. We show that the contribution of calcite to the overall anisotropy is non-negligible, with appropriate transversely isotropic elastic constants for the carbonate phase calculated. We demonstrate the use of high-load nanoindentation tests to successfully calibrate a micromechanical model. This is achieved by direct comparison of model results against the inversion of high-load indentation data.

These cyclic dynamic loadings could be tensile under repeated implosions, excavation induced unloading and reflection of compressive waves at free surfaces or interfaces. However, compared with cyclic dynamic compression, the rock fatigue characteristics under cyclic dynamic tension remain poorly understood. To investigate the dynamic tensile fatigue characteristics of rock, cyclic dynamic Brazilian tests and direct tension tests were conducted on granite using the split Hopkinson pressure bar and the split Hopkinson tension bar, respectively. The testing results showed that the peak stress of granite decreases, while the peak strain increases with increasing impact number under a given impact stress. The fatigue thresholds of granite in the cyclic dynamic Brazilian and direct tension tests are 0.71 and 0.49 times the critical impact stress, respectively, indicating that the rock is more prone to fatigue failure under dynamic direct tension. The total dissipated energy for fatigue failure of rock increases linearly with fatigue life. The damage accumulation features defined by energy dissipation and strain are distinct, and the damage calculated by strain can display nonlinear characteristics of damage evolution. In addition, with increasing impact stress, the failure surface roughness of the specimens in cyclic dynamic Brazilian tests increases, while that in direct tension tests decreases.

The working of the model is studied through the numerical example of gas production from a continuum quarter wellbore geometry solved by the finite element method. The numerical results support the field observations that gas productivity remains unaffected during early production operations whereas the water recovery is strongly dependent on capillary pressure redistribution in the fracture network induced by the applied drawdown. Although the drawdown is limited by field operations, a higher drawdown will not necessarily result in more water production unless the capillary forces are altered in the water-wet micro-fracture network. The sensitivity analysis showed important parameters which if not incorporated into the constitutive model fail to accurately capture the bulk behaviour such as the presence of water in the fracture network, fracture permeability, and fractal dimension (representing the pore structure). It was shown how neglecting two-fluid flow and multi-physics effects in the fracture network can have significant impacts on the accuracy of gas production data.

The fracture seems to deviate from the initial notch direction under different material angles, and this trend becomes more prominent with reduction of the elastic modulus and the fracture release rate perpendicular to the bending plane. The permeability anisotropy affects the fluid pattern and the fracture propagation length.

In the traditional longwall mining method, stress concentration and energy accumulation take place in the surrounding rock of the roadway, often causing dynamic disasters. To this end, the roof-cutting and energy-absorbing (RCEA) control method is proposed. Directional roof presplitting is used to transfer the roof stress and release the energy accumulated in the rock. Importantly, a roadway is automatically formed and coal pillars are eliminated. Moreover, new constant resistance energy-absorbing bolt and cable with high prestress and high elongation are used to control the roadway roof, which are independently developed. As a result, the self-supporting capacity of the rock is improved, and the energy released by the rock deformation is effectively absorbed by the support system. To verify the fidelity of the RCEA method, the numerical comparison test between the automatically formed roadway (AFR) method and the gob side entry driving method is carried out. Compared with the latter, the energy per unit length of AFR is reduced by 4.59*106\u00a0J, and the maximum energy density is reduced by 36.6%, which shows that AFR has profound effect on the energy release. Subsequently, the mechanical tests on the new bolt (cable) are carried out. The forces at fracture of the new bolt and cable are 1.63 times and 2.80 times that of the common bolt, and the maximum energy absorbed per unit length are 3.05 times and 2.89 times that of the common bolt.

In this work, considering the hardening and shrinking of the cement sheath, a finite-element model for evaluating the sealability of the cement interface during the whole life cycle of a well is constructed. The evolution of the cement interface failure is studied. Through a comprehensive parametric analysis, the influence of well trajectory, casing eccentricity, and cement sheath voids on the debonding of cement sheath is studied. Meanwhile, the influence of the pressure of the residual drilling fluid within the cement sheath is also investigated. The results show that the shrinkage of the cement sheath is the main factor that causes the debonding of the cement interface. The size of the micro-annulus of the debonding interface increases as the internal casing pressure decreases. The influence of wellbore trajectory on cement sheath debonding is not significant, while casing eccentricity and cement sheath voids have a larger impact. With the increase of casing eccentricity and cement sheath voids, the size of the micro-annulus increases. As the temperature of the cement sheath during the hydraulic fracturing process decreases, the pressure in the trapped residual drilling fluid decreases, causing the increase of the size of the micro-annulus.

In this study, the validity of the Yang et al. solution is first evaluated against a few numerical results obtained with FLAC3D.

For the global stability analysis, the value of the earth pressure coefficient needs to be modified while an inclined sliding plane needs to be considered for the local stability analysis. These considerations result in a considerable improvement because the updated solution does not contain any empirical calibration coefficient. Good agreements are obtained between the results obtained with numerical simulations and those predicted by the updated 3D analytical solution.

The dynamic loading by earthquake has triggered significant amplifications of ground motion and slope damage at the slope crest, resulting in densely spaced and interconnect fractures. These fractures split the slope into a collection of rock fragments with varied shapes, and the fragment size followed the Weibull's cumulative distribution. More than 70% of generated fragments were finer than 0.1 times the initial slope size, while only few large fragments existed at the slope base. The fragment size distribution pattern could quantitatively agree with field observations. The distributions of final slope damage index and cumulated fragmentation energy all followed the normal distribution pattern. The overall bulk seismic energy input into the slope was dissipated mainly at discontinuities and decreased with the increase of slope inclination.\n               ","26":"\n                  Tar-rich coal was directly combusted during power generation, resulting in a huge waste of precious oil resources and a large amount of carbon emissions. The idea of intelligent unmanned mining machine (IUMM) for in-situ fluidised mining and conversion of tar-rich coal was proposed to solve the problems of traditional mining and utilisation methods, realise efficient utilisation of tar-rich coal, and achieve net-zero CO2 emission. A key technology of IUMM is the pyrolysis and fragmentation of tar-rich coal by high-power microwave irradiation. In this study, we carried out experiments on the strength and microstructural changes of tar-rich coal under different microwave irradiation conditions using the high-power microwave irradiation testing system to explore the effects of microwave irradiation on tar-rich coal and provide a reference for the design of IUMM. The X-ray computed tomography was employed to observe and characterize the initiation, growth, connection, and spatial distribution of internal fractures of tar-rich coal under different microwave irradiation conditions. The quantitative relationship between the strength characteristics of tar-rich coal and microwave irradiation conditions was established. The results show that under a fixed microwave power or irradiation time, the overflow rate of coal gas and tar is linearly positively correlated with microwave energy E, and both the uniaxial compressive strength and brittleness of tar-rich coal have piecewise linear negative correlation with E. With the increase of E, the internal fractures grow and connect more, which are synchronised with the decrease of the uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of the tar-rich coal. With equal E input, high-power microwave has a more significant effect on strength weakening, fracturing, and fragmentation of tar-rich coal. Our findings can be used for the subsequent implementation of in-situ pyrolysis and fragmentation technology of IUMM for realising the in-situ conversion, high-efficiency utilisation, and low carbon emissions of tar-rich coal.\n               ","27":"\n                  Coupled static-dynamic tests were carried out on notched semi-circular bend (NSCB) granitic specimens using a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) device, to investigate the effects of axial pre-force and loading rate on dynamic fracture behavior of rocks. Digital image correlation (DIC) method was adopted to obtain the deformation field and fracturing process. The results indicate that the pre-force (up to 50% static peak force) enhances the fracture parameters overall, including fracture initiation toughness, fracture energy, crack propagation velocity (CPV) and fracture propagation toughness, but the effect of loading rate is more significant than that of the pre-force. Digital images show that the increase in pre-force would cause the dominant crack to symmetrically bifurcate since the pre-force strengthened a fan-shaped area for the specimen near the incident bar. The loading rate larger than 124\u00a0GPa\u00b7m1\/2\/s could lead to the secondly fracture of the specimen and thereby more fragments. Compared with previous studies, the present investigation deepens the understanding of fracture characteristics of rocks under coupled static and dynamic loads by further reducing the pre-force interval (0.25\u00a0kN). In addition, a new method based on the DIC technique is proposed to calculate crack opening distance (COD) and CPV, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy compared to the strain gauge method. Moreover, fracture propagation toughness is also emphasized apart from the initiation toughness. The findings can provide some enlightenments for rock fracture dynamics and crack propagation of highly stressed rocks.\n               ","28":"\n                  Identifying shale geological temperatures is important for understanding the thermal maturity, thermal evolutionary history, and hydrocarbon generation stages of shale formations, and enables efficient shale gas development. This paper investigates the thermal Kaiser effect of shales under different warming rates by studying the thermoacoustic emission (TAE) characteristics of shales in the Lower Palaeozoic Niutitang Formation in the Micangshan area of China. The developmental evolution and microscopic response mechanisms of different types of fractures in shales under high-temperature conditions are explored by combining acoustic emission (AE) characteristic parameters. The memory and sensitivity of the thermal Kaiser effect were also verified by thermal fatigue tests. The results show that there is a significant thermal Kaiser effect during the heating of shale and that its threshold temperature is approximately 180\u00a0\u00b0C, which is consistent with the palaeotemperatures based on bitumen reflectance (Rb) estimation. The heating rate does not have a significant effect on the threshold temperature. At high temperatures, the shale is dominated by small-scale tensile fractures. When the shale is heated to 300\u00a0\u00b0C, the organic matter reaction rate peaks and the proportion of shear cracks begins to increase. An increase in heating rate is beneficial to the development of large-scale tensile cracks, while inorganic minerals begin to expand due to heat and micro-cracks gradually expand and connect, thus improving the connectivity of the pore channels. In thermal fatigue tests, the shale retains its memory of the threshold temperature when heated to less than 300\u00a0\u00b0C. Above 300\u00a0\u00b0C, pyrolysis of organic matter and microcrack expansion interfere with the thermal Kaiser effect, causing the shale to lose its memory of the maximum temperature. Within the same cycle stage, the threshold temperature is significantly higher at high heating rates than at low ones, especially above 400\u00a0\u00b0C.\n               ","29":"\n                  Near-wellbore rock fracture is a key subject in subsurface energy extraction. Casing perforation completion is perhaps the most used type of well design mainly in comparison to the open hole completion. However, the effects of the combined casing-cementing-rock structure on pressure transmission in fracturing the rock have not been sufficiently addressed, but is key to understanding some important phenomena in hydraulic fracturing, such as fracture tortuosity. Here we develop a combined analytical-numerical model to investigate the rock fracture mechanism near the wellbore with realistic consideration of the boundary condition imposed by the complete well system. Different well configurations can lead to variation in the pressure applied on the rock formation and hence affect the fracture propagation near the wellbore. Our results show, as the pressure transmission through the well structure is enhanced, the fracture propagates more closely to the perforation orientation with a smaller deflection angle and the breakdown pressure is increased. The near-well tortuosity of the crack can be reduced by decreasing the thickness of casing and cement sheath, reducing Young's modulus of casing and increasing Young's modulus of cement up to around 15\u00a0GPa, based on the realistic range of values of the well parameters. The effects of in-situ stress condition and perforation angle and length on the near-well cracking are also investigated. The developed model can be used to aid decision making in terms of improved understanding of hydraulic fracturing technology and well design optimization.\n               ","30":"\n                  The fracturing properties and acoustic characteristics of heterogeneous and matrix-inclusion rocks are crucial to the safety of underground infrastructures and mining projects under extreme loading conditions. In this study, elliptically shaped matrix-inclusion specimens were fabricated with cement as the matrix and three rock materials (basalt, marble and sandstone) as inclusions which cover igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks with different strength ratios to the cement. Dynamic Brazilian tests were conducted on the specimens with various inclusion orientations \u03b2 (i.e. angles between impact direction and inclusion major axis) in the range of 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). By combining digital image correlation (DIC) and acoustic emission (AE) techniques, the integrated system demonstrates well-synchronised dynamic forces, DIC strain fields, and AE signals. The detailed procedures were presented to interpret dynamic mechanical properties, fracturing process and AE characteristics of specimens. Generally, for stronger inclusion materials with higher stiffness and strength, dynamic peak forces, threshold orientation angles of transgranular cracks, and AE counts and duration indicate higher characteristics. For instance, the fracture pattern of basalt inclusions transforms from interfacial crack to transgranular crack with increasing orientation angle \u03b2, and the specimens with transgranular cracks exhibit higher dynamic peak forces. It is observed that transgranular cracks are mainly induced by tensile stress with a higher AE peak frequency (200\u2013250\u00a0kHz), whereas interfacial cracks contain additional shear cracking having a relatively lower peak frequency (100\u2013150\u00a0kHz). Meanwhile, finite element modelling demonstrates that stress fields are affected by the elastic mismatch between inclusion and matrix, while failure modes (i.e. interfacial and transgranular cracks) are mainly governed by the tensile strength of inclusions.\n               ","31":"\n                  Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an emerging technology capable of producing exact replica specimens in rock mechanics. In this work, the sand 3D printing was explored to model the influence of cyclic freezing and thawing (F-T) for high-porosity weak rocks, which is one of the serious threats to rock stability in a cold region. The evolution of pore structure in the printed specimen during the F-T cycles was interpreted by the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation analysis. A series of Brazilian splitting tests combined with the digital image correlation (DIC) were conducted on these specimens experiencing different F-T cycles. The structural and mechanical degradation of the prepared specimens is reproduced, with a 44.30% increase in porosity and a 39.39% reduction in tensile strength at the end of 10\u00a0F-T cycles. Printed specimens deform in a less brittle manner in response to the F-T treatment. The accelerating rate of strain dispersion change was proposed to identify the precursor characteristics during the loading process. The F-T treatment induces the occurrence of precursor earlier than the peak stress, with the precursor stress ratios for the F-T untreated and treated specimens in the ranges of 99.62%\u201399.75%, and 97.15%\u201397.93%, respectively. Finally, the mechanical property degradation of fractured rock specimens after the F-T cycles is revealed, and a strong correlation between the mechanical property and the number of F-T cycles that display an exponential decay function is found. The sand 3D-printed specimens are shown to exhibit the changes in the pore structure, mechanical properties, failure pattern, strain distribution, and deformation evolution which resemble high-porosity weak rocks subjected to cyclic F-T.\n               ","32":"\n                  The effective stress law and the permeability play a notable role in dealing with the gas-solid coupling problem of porous media.

In this study, we developed a novel accurate grain-based modeling (AGBM) using the results of microscale rock mechanics experiments (micro-RME) to determine the elastic properties of arbitrarily shaped granite. The microstructure of each sample and Young's modulus of rock-forming minerals were measured with a TESCAN Integrated Mineral Analyzer (TIMA) and nanoindentation test. The geometry and Young's modulus of interphases between different minerals were determined using an advanced algorithm with atomic force microscopy (AFM) test. With the microstructure and microscale mechanical properties obtained from the micro-RME, the AGBM was applied to derive the macroscale mechanical properties of the granite samples. This new methodology was demonstrated on small test specimens extracted from granite fragments.

The present paper builds upon one of such methods (named DiAna), and extends it to enhance the assessment of rockfall susceptibility over steep rock walls. In particular, a Matlab routine (named DiAna-K) that incorporates a full three-dimensional derivation of kinematic analysis principles is introduced. Kinematic tests for plane, wedge, block toppling, flexural toppling, and free fall failure are formulated by explicitly accounting for the presence of overhanging areas of the rock face as well as varying frictional strengths across different discontinuity sets, planes, or intersections between planes. Results from a test application at an abandoned quarry site highlight the ability of the proposed procedure to provide detailed insights into the kinematic feasibility of structurally controlled instabilities.

We investigated hydraulic fracture paths generated via cyclic and monotonic injection in Pocheon granite, Gonghe granite, and gray sandstone. The gray sandstone has a porosity of 9.0% and its anisotropy was not considered in this study. The effect of cyclic injection on the reduction of hydraulic fracturing breakdown pressure was more significant in the two granites compared with that in the sandstone. Computed tomography images were obtained on fractured specimens for a quantitative evaluation of hydraulic fractures that included fracture length, fracture aperture, and tortuosity. Minerals along hydraulic fractures in the two granites were identified via an analysis of thin section collages from microscopic observations.

This has led to significant challenges in designing effective support systems, leading to costly mine development, production delays and support maintenance and rehabilitation requirements. Efforts to assess rock mass bulking have relied almost exclusively on the use of continuum modelling techniques, employing plasticity theory to predict the depth of brittle failure and associated post-yield deformations. However, rock mass bulking in high stress environments is largely driven by brittle fracturing resulting in geometric dilation, which involves shearing and buckling of spalled rock pieces as they deform into the excavation. Continuum techniques are inherently limited in their ability to model this behavior. This paper presents the results of research investigating the application of discontinuum-based numerical modelling techniques for assessing rock mass spalling and bulking in highly stressed pillars. The 3-D distinct-element program 3DEC is used to develop a bonded block modelling approach, referred to here as 3DEC-BBM. The method developed allows for the explicit modelling of brittle fracturing, spalling and geometric bulking, and the corresponding support responses, in reaction to the simulation of different mine stress paths and operation scenarios. Several different support strategies are investigated to test their effectiveness as a means to improve displacement-based support design in highly stressed pillars. These are based on the simulation of an extraction-level drawpoint pillar for a block cave mining operation that is exposed to the abutment stresses from an undercut passing over it. Based on the results, three key findings are presented and discussed: (1) Adding a small support pressure has a significant impact on the performance of the pillar. However, the benefits gained by further increasing this pressure diminish and have a less dramatic impact on spalling damage and bulking with increasing effort. (2) It is crucial to install appropriate support before the undercut passes over the extraction level pillars. The depth of damage and amount of bulking can increase significantly during pillar unloading following passing of the undercut. Extra confinement applied to the failed pillar skin allows it to carry more load and thus provide more confinement to the pillar core, helping to limit further damage and bulking. (3) The addition of support pressure through shotcrete and rock bolting performs similarly to \u201cperfectly\u201d installed steel sets. Thus, a heavier support system will not necessarily result in better pillar performance.\n               ","38":"\n                  The 3D reconstruction of rock joint surfaces is crucial for quantifying rock joints.

This statistical distribution of climbing angles and projection lengths provides an important reference for rock joint reconstruction, although hypothesis testing indicated that some joint profiles\/surfaces do not follow normal distributions. A normal distribution-based method and a bubbling method were used to reconstruct the 2D joint profiles. The bubbling method demonstrated good applicability for the generation of 3D rock joint surfaces, especially because it included surfaces with different roughness in two orthogonal directions. Therefore, ten typical 3D rock joint surfaces were reconstructed using the bubbling method, where both the size of asperities (waviness or unevenness) and the joint roughness coefficient values were quantified. To reconstruct a joint surface with a certain roughness coefficient, scaling the elevation of a generated surface was demonstrated as an effective supplementary approach.\n               ","39":"\n                  An elastoplastic damage constitutive model is constructed in this work to describe the macroscopic mechanical behaviors of geomaterials with a \u201cporous matrix - inclusion\u201d microstructure. In order to consider the influences of microstructure on its nonlinear behavior, such as the porosity, volume fraction of inclusions and the properties of the solid phase, the macroscopic yield criterion derived in Shen et\u00a0al. (2013) is adopted. By introducing a general damage factor, this criterion is extended phenomenologically to describe the elastoplastic damage behavior of the studied geomaterial. A plastic hardening law of the solid phase is considered to capture the hardening behavior. Then, a complete constitutive model is constructed by using a fractional plastic flow rule to calculate the macroscopic plastic deformation. The degree of non-associativity of the plastic flow rule can be controlled by the fractional derivative of the yield function, which avoids the introduction of macroscopic phenomenological plastic potential. The proposed model is implemented and applied to describe the mechanical behavior of claystone. Comparisons between the numerical predictions and experimental data show that the proposed model is able to capture the main mechanical features of the studied geomaterial, such as the damage procedure, the transition from volumetric contractancy to dilatancy and the brittle to ductile transition with the increase of confining pressure.\n               ","40":"\n                  The scaling laws describing the spatial arrangement of fractures along six deep boreholes penetrating the crystalline rocks in the Rhine Graben were derived using a correlation analysis.

Five datasets were derived from borehole imaging logs, whilst one stemmed from the analysis of 810\u00a0m of continuous core at Soultz. The two differed inasmuch as the core dataset included essentially all fractures, whereas the image log dataset had few fractures narrower than 1\u20133\u00a0mm. The results of the analysis for all image datasets showed that the spatial arrangement of fractures followed fractal behavior at all scales from meters to several hundred meters, the largest scale amenable to assessment, and that the fractal dimensions were confined to the narrow range 0.85\u20130.9. However, the core dataset showed significant deviation from fractal behavior, the best-fit fractal dimension of 0.8 being somewhat lower than values obtained from imaging logs in neighboring wells. Eliminating fractures with apertures less than 1\u00a0mm from the core dataset to improve comparability led to even lower fractal dimension estimates, indicating the discrepancy was not due to imaging log resolution. Analysis of successive depth sections of the core log suggested the discrepancy was due to the presence of a localized zone between 1750 and 2070 m where the fractal organization is disturbed or takes a lower dimension than elsewhere. Aside from this zone, no systematic variation of fractal dimension with depth was observed in any dataset, implying that a single exponent together with intensity adequately describes the arrangement of fractures along the entire length of the boreholes.

Then prismatic sandstones with a circular hole in different filling modes were prepared and tested in uniaxial compression tests. Progressive deformation and fracturing behavior around holes were analyzed by digital image correlation technique. Moreover, the energy evolution characteristics of specimens were studied to reveal its deformation and failure mechanism. The results show that after filling, the radial and tangential stress and displacement of the inclusion increase, while the stress and displacement around the surrounding rock of the hole decreases, thereby improving the strength and deformation properties. In addition, the crack types and initiation positions around the unfilled and filled holes are quite different due to the stress redistribution. Based on the energy evolution characteristics and the major principal strain fields, the stress-strain behavior is divided into five stages. It is found that the inclusion not only has passive supporting and energy absorption effects on the surrounding rock, but also has a similar crack arrest effect on the initiation and propagation of new cracks.

In our research, coal seepage experiments under variable bulk stress and pore pressure paths are performed to investigate the slippage effect and effective stress effect during gas migration in deep coal seams. The results show that the gas flow pattern changes from effective stress\u2013control to slippage effect\u2013control during the increase of bulk stress.

The displacement of marble spheres with Hertzian cracks or oblique fractures in cyclic compression tests can be significantly larger than the displacement (0.31\u00a0mm) corresponding to sample breakage in monotonic compression tests. The SEM observations reveal that mineral fragmentation, plastic shear sliding and crack closure occur in the local contact area, resulting in obvious residual displacement. Hertzian cracks were produced by the combination of densification and shear strength degradation under cyclic loading. Typical two-stage behaviour of cumulative residual displacement and dynamic secant stiffness evolution with the number of cycles was clearly observed. The occurrence of Hertzian cracks or oblique fractures produced significant cumulative residual displacement. The present laboratory results also show that the increase in amplitude can result in a significantly larger cumulative residual displacement and that the number of cycles of marble sphere failure in meridian fracture significantly increases with an increase in the frequency of cyclic loading. The upper contact force ratio and amplitude ratio significantly influence the dynamic secant stiffness evolution. The dynamic secant stiffness of tests under amplitude ratios of 0.7 and 0.8 shows a clear decreasing trend after the initial decelerating stage, which may be related to the loosening and decohesion of mineral particles caused by local significant fragmentation.\n               ","45":"\n                  Petrophysical properties of cylindrical core specimens from three boreholes from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program, the DSeis project, measured at ambient pressure and room temperature conditions in various laboratories are presented and compared with downhole petrophysical data (sonic and density). The measured properties are from sixty-six rock specimens constituting metasediments, metabasalts and intrusives. Seismic velocities were measured using 0.5 MHz P- and S-wave transducers. To investigate the source of seismic reflectivity observed on the 2D legacy seismic data, we computed synthetic seismograms for adjacent rock units using downhole petrophysical data and compared them with seismic reflections from the reflection seismic profile. The experimental measurements show that the metasediments exhibit lower bulk densities and seismic velocities than the metabasalts and intrusive specimens. The porosity was found to be less than 2% for all the samples. No clear trends emerge when the Poisson's ratio is plotted against the P-wave velocities and porosities of the samples. A positive relationship is observed between the bulk modulus and P-wave velocities of the rock samples. The highest calculated reflection coefficients (RC) are associated with the metasediment-intrusive interfaces in all three boreholes. The intrusive-metabasalt and the metasediment-metabasalt interfaces exhibit low RC. Synthetic seismograms reveal strong reflections that coincide with high RC calculated using the bulk density and velocity data. The synthetic seismograms also revealed additional strong reflections that were not identified using the reflection coefficients calculated from the rock specimens, due to core loss in some lithological units. Successful correlations are carried out between the synthetic seismic data and the real seismic data, enabling us to correlate the stratigraphic sequence drilled in the boreholes to the seismic reflections observed on the legacy 2D reflection seismic data.\n               ","46":"\n                  Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is being applied in an increasing number of geoscientific fields. We present herein preliminary results of applying DAS to monitor microseismicity in underground mines. We installed 275\u00a0m of fiber optic cable approximately 1500\u00a0m below the surface in an operational mine and recorded mine seismicity for two weeks during November of 2018. The first approximately 50\u00a0m was tied to the sidewall safety mesh and a further 225\u00a0m was grouted into a down-dipping borehole alongside four three-component geophone sensors with 14\u00a0Hz high-sensitivity elements. The geophone sensors are located 132\u00a0m, 154\u00a0m, 176\u00a0m and 198\u00a0m down the borehole. We show that, for the larger seismic events (M\n                     \n                        W\n                     \u00a0>\u00a0\u22120.1), there is relatively good agreement in the data collected with DAS compared to the geophone data. There is some amplitude variation, especially at higher frequencies, but the phase of the recordings match well. We were able to include the DAS data in processing select events using PhaseNet, a machine-learning based algorithm, to pick phase arrivals and then locate these events using a recently developed interferometric method. In our comparison of the background noise of the DAS and that of the geophones, we found that the DAS as installed in our experiment has a noise floor orders of magnitude higher than the seismic background of the mine. Furthermore we compared the recordings in the different fiber sections (tied to the safety mesh and grouted, respectively) to analyze the feasibility of using existing mining communication infrastructure as sufficiently accurate seismic sensors. Fiber optic communication cables are typically tied to the sidewall mesh in the absence of dedicated conduits, and thus our mesh-coupled section was a suitable proxy for this scenario. We found extremely limited utility in the recordings of the mesh coupled fiber.\n               ","47":"\n                  Wellbore instability is an important consideration during both drilling and production of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The optimal well trajectory must be determined during the design phase to avoid wellbore shear failures. This study makes two fundamental contributions towards improving contemporary wellbore shear models. For the first time, the analytical wellbore shear models are formulated implicitly to significantly improve the computational efficiency and obtainable accuracy. The stability problem is resolved with the bisection method and an optimisation algorithm, where Powell\u2019s method and the Nelder-Mead method have been implemented here. The second contribution is to account for the depletion of various formations, especially coal, in the stability models. Three stress models, namely those of Gray, Shi and Durucan, and Cui and Bustin, were used to develop stress paths for a depleted coal reservoir. The results were quantified via the maximum allowable pressure (MAP), which indicates the wellbore pressure required to avoid wellbore failure and thus guide corresponding operational decisions.\n                  The results of this work show that implicit methods significantly improve computational efficiency over the conventional iterative method used in the literature and industry. In particular, it was found that Powell\u2019s method saves greater than 95% of the computation time for sandstone and coal case studies, respectively. In terms of stability during depletion, a higher depletion pressure resulted in an increased MAP. For a drilling application, this means that a greater overbalance pressure is required. While in a production application, a lower maximum drawdown pressure would be expected. The Gray model indicates the largest impact on stability prediction for depleted coals, and the Cui and Bustin model is the most conservative among the three stress models. The proposed numerical framework provides an efficient tool to determine the optimal well trajectory for different formations (e.g. coal, clastic rock) experiencing depletion before or after drilling.\n               ","48":"\n                  The main objective in this study is to experimentally investigate how two types of shales different in swelling characteristic and organic carbon content behave in terms of the mechanical and infiltration properties when being subjected to changing osmosis with varying brine salinity under in-situ stress conditions. This research also aims to determine the swelling tendency of thePierre shale and replicate the effect of selection of brine salinity on oil recovery in liquid-rich shales. A series of coupled measurements from the triaxial experiments at reservoir conditions was conducted on Pierre shale core samples to determine rock properties and behavior under fluid pore pressure intrusion. The main use of the measured properties is to demonstrate the impact of fluid transport induced by low salinity water injection accompanied by osmosis, clay swelling, and rock elasticity change on oil recovery from rock matrix. The Young's modulus, bulk modulus, and Poisson's ratio of the Pierre shale were determined from measurements on the two types of Pierre shale samples obtained from an outcrop having high 65\u00a0wt% of smectite content and well core having lean clay content and 3.5\u00a0wt% TOC (total organic carbon). The first two experiments were performed on the outcrop samples comprising of similar characteristics of 65\u00a0wt% smectite with negligible TOC while the last experiment was performed on the well core sample containing negligible smectite content with 3.5\u00a0wt% TOC.\n                  The membrane efficiencies of the shale samples were experimentally determined to range from 5% to 28% depending on clay content and stress. The outcrop shale showed 1% of swelling that is significantly higher than 0.07% of swelling developed in the well core shale lean in clay content. One of the most important findings of this research is that the membrane coefficient representing the stress sensitivity of membrane efficiency of organic-rich well core shale was found to be 11.5%\/kpsi which is significantly higher than that of the swelling shale ranging from 2.2 to 3.5%\/kpsi. This is interesting because the approximately 5.5 times stiffer matrix of organic-rich shale shows the significantly higher stress sensitivity in terms of the membrane efficiency. The Young's modulus of swelling shale declined with water saturation as well as the water transfer driven by osmotic pressure with low salinity brine. In contrast, the well core shale showed significant increase in the dynamic Young's modulus.\n                  The experimental data were used to evaluate the mass exchange between the fractures and rock matrix using a coupled fluid flow and geomechanics model accounting for shale swelling and osmosis transport to evaluate how fluid and rock interaction affect the oil recovery from the rock matrix of the Pierre shale during low salinity water injection (LSWI). A 25% increase in oil recovery factor was determined after considering the effects of changing membrane efficiency due to clay swelling resulting from LSWI. The modeling results therefore suggest that the variation of membrane efficiency due to swelling can be an important factor affecting the oil recovery from matrix block during LSWI enhanced oil recovery.\n               ","49":"\n                  A three-dimensional CFD-DEM simulation method was developed to investigate the influence of different reservoir fluids on sand production. The fluid properties and reservoirs were prescribed and modelled after the conditions in the Kenkiyak and Uzen oil fields in Kazakhstan. A cylindrical sandstone sample was modelled using the Discrete Element Method in three stages of the pluviation, diagenesis, and perforation processes as in the oil field. A coupled simulation with the Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to simulate the sand production from the perforated sandstone under different fluid flow conditions with light and heavy oils. A continuous sand production was found to be more severe with the heavy oil flow due to its higher transport capability and a microstructural sanding mechanism that mobilized a higher proportion of the sample's particles with the fluid outflow. Sand production for light oil occurred in two stages of a first transient sand production that was followed by a second continuous sand production. The transient sand production was associated with more significant bond breakage, particle movement and porosity change within the damage zone that was created by the central perforation inside the sandstone sample.\n               ","50":"\n                  In underground mining, rock mass stress is commonly modeled as a continuum. However, in block cave mining discrete modelling should be used to properly represent the stress over the extraction level in the broken column where there are high rock columns of large rock fragments. Unfortunately, we lack methods that use discrete modelling of stress in the broken column at block caving scale. In this work, we propose a vertical stress model of granular material to simulate static and dynamic flow conditions. The model is developed within a gravity flow simulator based on cellular automata to simulate the scale of the problem and flow conditions. The vertical stress model proposed is calibrated through four experimental models for the static condition. Then, based on the results from experimental testing, the dynamic condition is calibrated and compared with different flow scenarios. The results show that the proposed model can correctly simulate the vertical stresses in static conditions as well as dynamic conditions under the different flow setups tested. This vertical stress model with its flow simulator based on cellular automata has the potential to be applied at block caving scale once calibration parameters are defined.\n               ","51":"\n                  A comprehensive analysis of crack initiation and propagation in coal is critical for understanding its mechanical behavior and its impact on permeability. The finite element-based digital volume correlation (DVC) of time-resolved X-ray tomography images under cleat-parallel uniaxial compression provides 3D incremental strain fields to understand the evolution and propagation of cracks. In this study, DVC coupled with quantitative image analysis was used to understand the role of cleats in guiding and initiating cracks in coal. Simulation of fluid flow through coal at different loading segments provides dynamic quantification of evolution in permeability. After each loading stage, quantification of strain eigen vectors and image analysis indicates appearance, coexistence, and coalescence of tensile and shear cracks guided by the organic matter in coal. We established that constructive interference between tensile and shear crack systems enhances permeability and decreases tortuosity by almost 3x and 7x respectively in coal by widening crack aperture, however, destructive interference is likely to lead to matrix pulverization and clogging of larger crack apertures. During compression, while one part of the coal matrix shows extension perpendicular to the loading direction, another part shows slippage parallel to the loading direction. Based on the variation in crack propagation behavior, four distinct crack morphology zones were identified and discussed. We found that the tortuosity of the cracks decreases exponentially, while permeability and crack volume fraction increase exponentially up to 2.8\u00a0\u03bcm2 and 28.6% respectively with increasing load. The box-counting-based fractal dimension for the cracks shows a steady increase from 1.58 to 1.78 with loading due to the evolution of existing cracks, and the formation of new cracks.\n               ","52":"\n                  The implementation of multi-crack recognition requires a theoretical basis from single-crack failure results. This study investigates the spatial distribution pattern of microcracks in single-crack-damaged coal specimens subjected to uniaxial compression. The distribution mechanism of the induced microcracks is analysed in terms of macrocracks and stress states. Gaussian and Weibull distributions are selected to explore the spatial distribution of microcracks, and quantile\u2013quantile plots are used to study the probability density plots. The results show that the updated data better demonstrate the distribution characteristics of the ellipsoid shape visually, and the microcracks are observed to converge near the envelope. Linear distribution features are found in the scattered points of the quantile\u2013quantile plots. The goodness-of-fit tests indicate that both Gaussian and Weibull distributions can be assigned to describe the microcrack distribution on the new axis. The probability density distribution results show that the shape is preferred to obey Gaussian distribution, whereas Weibull distribution exhibits a greater possibility of shape variation. The study results can enhance the existing knowledge on crack spatial distribution of acoustic emission positioning results associated with rock materials. In addition, the statistical results can interpret the cracks by recognising them with a specified distribution pattern.\n               ","53":"\n                  The DECOVALEX Project is an international research collaboration for advancing the understanding and modeling of coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in geological systems.

The proposed method can be performed under two test conditions: 1) strip load test and strain inversion (single strip load method) and 2) strip load test combined with Brazilian test and strain inversion (strip load and Brazilian method). Strain inversion was carried out by finite element modeling to determine the elastic constants by minimizing the difference between the measured and numerically modeled strains. The method was validated by numerical and laboratory experiments in comparison with the conventional method that uses two uniaxial compression tests with multiple coring directions. In the numerical validation, elastic constants were estimated with high accuracy for cores with high coring angles by the single strip load method. The strip load and Brazilian method accurately determined the five elastic constants for all ranges of coring angles. Validation using Asan gneiss showed that both the approaches of the suggested method can determine the five elastic constants using a single-orientation core. Most of the experimental results were within the range of variations often observed in rock mechanics experiments. The method combining uniaxial compression and Brazilian tests was additionally proposed even though it required an empirical relation of the second shear modulus for horizontally and vertically layered cores. Further, the experimental results were discussed in terms of heterogeneity, nonlinear stress\u2013strain relationship, and Saint\u2013Venant empirical relation. The existing method using a single uniaxial compression test involving the Saint\u2013Venant empirical relation was also tested, showing limited reliability for low coring angles. The suggested methods using a single-orientation core will contribute to a convenient determination of elastic constants of transversely isotropic rocks.\n               ","55":"\n                  In cold mountainous regions, the freeze-thaw cycling often leads to rock weathering, which might trigger spalling, significant landslides and rockfalls. In this work, we used combined experimental, theoretical and numerical approaches to investigate the mechanisms of frost cracking as a result of coupled effects of freeze-thaw cycling, confining stress and the interaction of multiple cracks. The experimental facility with a temperature cycling chamber and a high-pressure cell has been developed. We used rock-like materials (rock analogue samples made from cured cement and quartz-sand mixtures) to conduct the experiments. The rock-like samples contain pre-existing single or double initial cracks, which are then water filled and exposed to freeze-thaw cycling. The coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical modeling for analyzing fractures induced by freeze-thaw cycling was achieved by using a code that was previously developed named TOUGH-AiFrac. Good agreements between the TOUGH-AiFrac modeling and the laboratory experiments have been achieved including the exact paths of crack propagation. The experimental and numerical results show that the frost cracks tend to propagate in the direction of maximum principal stress. The results further show that the interaction effect between two frost cracks is significantly influenced by the position, orientation and offset of initial cracks, as well as the orientation of intact rock bridges between the cracks. At last, the stress shadow that was calculated by the TOUGH-AiFrac model between two cracks was discussed.\n               ","56":"\n                  This paper investigates the effects of the gradient distribution of microdefects on wave propagation through a rock mass.

Subsequently, the effects of gradient and frequency on the particle stress transmission coefficient, particle velocity transmission coefficient, and energy transmission coefficient were discussed. The results indicate that a rock mass with a microdefect gradient distribution significantly affects wave propagation. The traditional study of wave propagation in a rock mass with a uniform distribution of microdefects can be considered a special example of the present study. In addition, the particle velocity transmission coefficient and energy transmission coefficient are always less than 1.0. However, when the gradient is large and the frequency is small, the particle stress transmission coefficient is larger than 1.0, which shows that the particle stress amplitude in a rock mass with a microdefect gradient distribution will be amplified.\n               ","57":"\n                  The problems of cost, environmental protection and efficiency of hard rock fragmentation in petroleum exploration, drilling and other projects need to be solved urgently. Electro-pulse-boring (EPB) technology has attracted attention due to its advantages of low rock breaking energy consumption, low wear and low time cost. However, there is still no more accurate description model for EPB and rock fragmentation, and the existing models have limited guidance on the parameter optimization of EPB tools. This paper introduces an electric breakdown model, which realizes the whole electric breakdown process under a single high-voltage pulse by coupling the five fields: circuit field, current field, breakdown field, heat transfer field and solid mechanical field. The multi physics model comprehensively considers the circuit structure parameters of the electric impulse generator (EIG), the initiation and development of electric breakdown, the dependence of electric breakdown strength and time, and the heterogeneity of rock. The model results found that the breakdown channel originates from the weak electric strength in the rock, and the development of the channel is highly dependent on the heterogeneity of the rock medium. The rock fragmentation process with a single pulse is accompanied by local electric fragmentation and hydroelectric fragmentation, When the pulse voltage rise time (PVRT) is greater than 500 ns, the hydroelectric fragmentation mode is dominant. The temperature and thermal stress values of the discharge channel are consistent with the previous studies results, and the temperature distribution at the electrode tip is the highest, which shows that the ablation problem of the electrode in EPB process can not be ignored. This model has the potential to establish the relationship between rock-breakingparameters and rock-breaking efficiency of EPB, and can provide a practical method for the development and parameter optimization of EPB and rock breaking tools.\n               ","58":"\n                  The mechanical properties of rock masses are significantly affected by the deformated behaviors of discontinuities, such as joints and faults.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the deformed response of rock joints under dynamic loads. In this study, a series of dynamic compression expriments are carried out on rock joints with different joint roughness using the SHPB equipment with digital image correlation (DIC) technique. It found the dynamic compressive bebaviors of rock joints have viscoelstic features. Then a variable-order fractional Kelvin-Voigt (VFKV) model is proposed to simulate this behaviour, which consists of a variable-order fractional viscous dashpot and a spring in parallel. The model is verified to effectively represent the dynamic compressive process of rock joints. Finally, based the proposed model, the influence of model parameters, loading rate, and joint contact area ratio on the viscoelastic behaviour and mechanical property of rock joints are discussed. The results show the viscoelasticity behaviour of joints is significantly affected by the loading rate and joint contact area ratio, high loading rate and joint contact area may strengthen the elastic properties of the joints, while the joint roughness has the opposite effect.\n               ","59":"\n                  Strain burst occurs within highly stressed hard rocks in underground excavations. A prerequisite for strain bursting is that excess energy exists to eject material after rock failure. Both the bursting rock and the surrounding rock mass will contribute to the excess energy. However, the proportion of the energy contributed from each is currently not well understood. This issue will be quantitatively investigated in this study. In this paper, the energy sources for strain bursting and the energy conversion during bursting are first illustrated in two conceptual models. The portions of the energy dissipated and released from the bursting rock and the surrounding rock mass are differentiated by means of numerical modeling. The numerical modeling shows that the proportion of energy released from the surrounding rock mass increases with increasing burst depth. Beyond a critical burst depth, the energy released from the surrounding rock mass becomes higher than the energy stored in the bursting rock. This concept was further verified by an analytical solution to the behavior of a circular opening when its radius is enlarged. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the magnitude of the burst is mainly determined by the strain energy released from the bursting rock itself in a shallow burst event, but it is more associated with the energy released from surrounding rock mass in a large scale burst event.\n               ","60":"\n                  In this study, we investigated the failure process and evolution mechanisms in circular tunnels under a complex stress path of deep in-situ stress\u00a0+\u00a0excavation unloading\u00a0+\u00a0stress adjustment using a simulation test based on loading first and then drilling (LFTD) mode. This test was performed on cubic sandstone specimens using a true-triaxial testing system combined with a self-developed drilling unloading test device. For comparison, another set of sandstone specimens, similar to the original specimens but with \u03a625 mm circular through-holes, were processed to perform another set of simulation tests based on drilling first and then loading (DFTL) mode. Under constant lateral stress, compared with the DFTL test, the initial failure vertical stress was lower, and the surrounding rock was more prone to failure in the LFTD test, indicating that drilling unloading causes damage to the surrounding rock, thereby inducing a strength-weakening effect. Under constant lateral and vertical stresses, sidewall failure in the LFTD test was more severe. The sidewall's initial failure vertical stress difference between the LFTD and DFTL tests increases with increasing lateral stress or initial hydrostatic pressure. The effect of drilling unloading becomes more apparent under a higher initial stress state. Comparing the same types of simulation tests under different stress states, the initial failure vertical stress increases with the lateral stress or initial hydrostatic pressure, inducing a strength-strengthening effect in the surrounding rock.

Furthermore, unlike other fracture modeling techniques there is no need to provide information about the crack path. We utilize the peridynamics code Peridigm and take a two-stage approach to fracture modeling. First an implicit solve is performed to compute the in-situ stress state. We then execute an explicit solve where a pressure loading designed to emulate fluid-driven hydraulic fracture is applied at the borehole and transmitted to the pre-stressed rock. We present results from polynomial and single and multi-level Gaussian process surrogate models constructed from a sampling study of the peridynamics model. The surrogates predict crack area given a measure of the in-situ stress anisotropy and rise time and amplitude of the pressure loading.

The simulations of the model indicate that the increase of moisture lowers the yield stress and reduces the brittleness of the post-yielding response of variably saturated cemented granular materials. It is shown that the rate of damage and breakage growth control the distortion of the yield surface. When inelasticity is dominated by damage, cement bonds are disintegrated and the yield surface shrinks, thus resulting into augmented brittleness. By contrast, and in agreement with experimental evidence, the response of lightly cemented granular solids is found to be dominated by the breakage of the skeletal grains.

Secondly, the evolution of the mechanical behavior and localization patterns, such as deformation band angles and localized dilatancy, indicate a transition from the brittle regime to the ductile regime that is not only dependent on an increase in the mean stress, but also on a decrease in the Lode angle.

Coal permeability in each direction can be affected by the stress changes in any directions. The permeability parallel to the bedding plane is more sensitive to change in stresses than in perpendicular to the bedding due to higher fracture compressibility. The cleat compressibility could increase with gas adsorption, especially for carbon dioxide.

In the present contribution, a series of experiments were designed and conducted on intact Utica shale samples to study the simultaneous effects of gas slippage and poroelasticity under constant confining and constant effective stress conditions. In addition, an apparent permeability model was developed considering the effects of rock poroelasticity and a non-constant velocity gradient for gas flow at the pore wall. The model was calibrated and tested against the presented experimental results for Utica shale as well as previously published data. Results show that the concavity in Klinkenberg plots is caused by two separate parameters, each dominant within different ranges of pore pressures: second-order gas slippage and effective stress coefficient. The model demonstrates that gas slippage is inherently coupled with effective stress at low pore pressures. However, the evolution of apparent permeability with gas pressure deviates from the classical Klinkenberg theory only when the pore diameter is sufficiently small. When the effective stress coefficient is smaller than unity, the permeability evolution deviates from the linear Klinkenberg trend only at high pore pressures. In addition to the pore size, gas slippage is found to be closely correlated with the variation of gas viscosity with pressure and temperature.\n               ","69":"\n                  To investigate the static mechanical properties and failure characteristics of damaged rocks after impact under realistic in-situ stress, dynamic triaxial compression tests with different strain rates and confining pressures were conducted on diorite by a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar. The damage factor was calculated according to the change of the longitudinal wave velocity of rocks before and after the impact, and the residual strengths of the damaged diorite were obtained by uniaxial compression and Brazilian tensile tests. In addition, three brittleness indexes based on the residual strength were adopted to evaluate the brittleness of damaged specimens, and fractal dimension was introduced to study the fragmentation characteristics. The results show that the dynamic peak stress, strain, elastic modulus, damage factor and plastic deformation of diorite all increase with increasing strain rate, i.e., rate dependence, and the increasing rate decreases with increasing confining pressure. The increment in confining pressure leads to the increase of dynamic peak stress, elastic modulus, static residual strength and brittleness, and the increasing rate increases with increasing strain rate, while other physio-mechanical parameters decrease with confining pressure. The post-peak behavior of dynamic stress-strain curves is divided into two classes according to the strain rate and fracture state of rocks under dynamic loading. Upon the strain rate increases above 87 s\u22121, the brittleness of damaged specimens generally decreases to moderately brittle or even low brittle, and the corresponding drillability becomes much easier. The fractal dimension of damaged specimens increases with the increase of confining pressure and decreases linearly with the increase of strain rate.\n               ","70":"\n                  Ground surface uplift was detected during longwall mining in the Lazy Mine, a hard coal mine in the Czech part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Czech Republic. The greatest uplift was 218\u00a0mm, based on surface point levelling by comparing surface points with heights of non-mined areas. This uplift occurred during subcritical mining at an average depth of 740\u00a0m below the surface. The mined coal seam is situated below the previously mined part of the multi-seam deposit. This study aims to provide a geomechanical explanation for ground surface uplift observed during longwall mining. The source of surface uplifts were deep inside the rock mass, therefore, enabling only the examination of geological, geomechanical, seismic, and technical mining data for uplift occurrence analysis. Therefore, the spatiotemporal evaluation of the observed vertical displacement and induced seismicity data was processed, and the observed ground surface was compared with empirical subsidence. Two time periods with surface uplifts during longwall mining were evaluated. Thick, competent rock layers, together with specific geomechanical conditions, were identified as the main characteristics responsible for the uplift.\n               ","71":"\n                  The salts contained in water can gradually accumulate in pore networks of rocks under wetting-drying cycles, which could cause rock deterioration. The salt-induced damage under this cyclic process can result in dynamically evolving mechanical and hydraulic properties of the rock, which is relevant to many rock-related engineering activities and geological hazards. In this study, the structure damage and permeability evolution of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) sandstone subjected to wetting-drying cycles with salt solution were investigated by a series of multiscale experiments. The results showed that the salt solution has a significant impact on the physical properties of TGR sandstone during the wetting-drying process. With increasing wetting-drying cycles, two typical macroscopic damage modes in form of surface peeling and internal cracking were observed. Various physical parameters indicated that the internal structure of the TGR sandstone experienced two stages: 1) Salt accumulation and new crack formation stage and 2) Crack propagation stage. This variation also profoundly affected the permeability of the TGR sandstone. Specifically, the permeability of TGR sandstone decreased slightly at first due to blocked seepage channels by crystals before cycle 5, followed by a slow growth until the 15th cycle and a rapid increase after the 15th cycle. Cubic and exponential functions showed good performances to describe the evolution features of permeability with porosity and wetting-drying cycles, respectively. The deterioration mechanism was further elucidated by an evaporation test. This test indicated that the salt solution was more likely to crystallize in narrow pores and expectedly exert pressure enough to crack the pores, contributing to the structure damage feature and the permeability enhancement. These findings and results in this study deepen our understanding of salt-induced rock deterioration mechanism under the wetting-drying cycles and would be meaningful for rock engineering safety and geological disaster forecast in complex groundwater environments.\n               ","72":"\n                  This study reveals the important role of hydromechanical responses of large hydraulic fractures in the cause and mechanisms of induced seismicity associated with the Mw 5.5 earthquake at the Pohang geothermal site, South Korea. Fractures intersecting two stimulation wells, PX-1 and PX-2, were identified through a comprehensive analysis of various data produced from drilling and hydraulic stimulations, including injection flow-pressure and seismicity data. Coupled hydromechanical numerical modeling of five stimulations performed in the PX-1 and PX-2 wells, showed that injection-induced hydraulic jacking and fracture shearing induce immediate stress transfer that plays a significant role in understanding seismic response at the Mw 5.5 fault. The friction coefficient times fluid pressure change by the PX-2 stimulations accounts for only 20% of the total CFS change at the location of the Mw 5.5 earthquake. The absence of seismic events at the Mw 5.5 fault by the PX-1 stimulations is attributed to the transfer of reduced shear stress at the PX-1 fracture due to shear slip. Kaiser effects in the seismic response observed during the PX-1 stimulation is explained by the irreversible nature of shear slip of the PX-1 fracture for the first time. In addition, post-injection seismicity, observed during the PX-2 stimulations, is attributed to a low permeability of the PX-2 fracture. The current modeling study suggests that coupled hydromechanical analysis with appropriate consideration of fractures is a powerful approach in understanding the mechanism of injection-induced seismicity in fractured geological media.\n               ","73":"\n                  To investigate frictional properties of the rupture surface of the carbonate Jiweishan rock avalanche, we conducted high-velocity-friction tests on the limestone and shale samples at different shear rates.

The critical shear rate was deduced to be between 0.05 and 0.2\u00a0m\/s in our tests. The friction coefficient reduced to an extremely low value of less than 0.1\u00a0at a shear rate of 2.1\u00a0m\/s. The sliding rock mass therefore could slide out of the rupture surface at a high velocity and consequently traveled a long distance as granular debris. Two mechanisms may have reduced the frictional resistance. Recrystallized calcite nanograins and CaO nanograins produced through calcite decomposition covered and lubricated the shear surface. Furthermore, the CO2 emitted through calcite decomposition reduced the effective normal stress and therefore the friction on the surface. Our conclusions for Jiweishan rock avalanche are also useful for understanding the high mobility of other widely distributed carbonate rock avalanches.\n               ","74":"\n                  Wellbore collapse, seafloor subsidence, and seismic events are some of the main technical and societal issues related to the deformation of producing chalk reservoirs.

Most of the experimental studies are related to chalk from the Upper Maastrichtian Tor Fm. that is the main oil-bearing unit in the North Sea. The overlying Danian Ekofisk Fm. that also contains a non-negligible part of the hydrocarbon reserves has however received little attention. The aim of this study is to assess the plastic and shear behaviour of oil-saturated, Danian chalk containing different amount of quartz by using an extensive experimental dataset. The hydrostatic yield stresses and the Mohr-Coulomb criteria are quantified across a 30\u201345% porosity range for specimens with a low (<3%) and high amount of quartz (>4%), referred to as clean and impure chalk. Porosity-dependent functions are proposed to estimate the geomechanical properties and the yield surface is reconstructed in a plot of mean-deviatoric stress versus porosity. These results are compared with previous studies on Maastrichtian chalk. The plastic and shear behaviour of Danian and Maastrichtian chalk appears similar for porous specimens and differs as porosity declines. The differences are of significance changing the geomechanical properties by a factor of 20%\u201360%. The mineralogical and diagenetic parameters that can explain these observations are discussed. The outcomes can be integrated in constitutive models to improve the prediction on the contribution of the Ekofisk Fm. to the total strain occurring in depleted reservoirs from the North Sea.

The aim of this study was to numerically simulate the rock-breaking process of the TBM disc cutters to investigate the performance of the cutters on composite rocks. The underlying numerical simulation was validated by our full-scale laboratory tests. A series of numerical simulations were shown to lead to an accurate determination of the disc cutters performance on composite rocks of sandstone and granite in terms of the normal force, torque and specific energy. This indicates that there are some similarities between homogeneous and composite rocks, e.g., both show an optimal ratio of cutter spacing, s, to penetration depth, p, i.e., optimal s\/p. Nevertheless, there are many more significant differences demonstrated in our study, including the composite ratio-dependent different ranges of the cutter force, torque and specific energy, changes of the optimum s\/p, and the characteristic that s\/p decreases linearly with the increase of the composite ratio. Although the optimal s\/p is different for different composite ratios, it is possible to obtain a representative optimal s\/p, e.g., 14, in our case, i.e. composite rocks of sandstone and granite, which may approximately optimise the composite rock-breaking, irrespective of different composite ratios.

The objective of this study was to develop a method based on the implicit generation of a synthetic distribution of seismic data and on the results of numerical modelling, providing a means to decompose the modelling results into a statistical distribution of maximum magnitudes. The results of this method provide a statistical distribution of the maximum magnitudes, based on existing plastic modelling results and assumptions about the failure mechanism.

Strainbursts are complex events characterized by a spontaneous strain-energy liberation at the boundaries of underground excavations, putting both the long-term safety of operations and exposing workers to risk. In this study, we reported a series of uniaxial compression tests by using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) and a high-speed camera, to understand the role of dynamic loads and high strain rates (10\u2013102 s-1) in the mechanical behavior and fracture patterns of veined rocks. The samples are representative of major deep underground mine districts in Chile: Chuquicamata (QS), Andina (RB), and El Teniente (CMET). Results show a clear increase in the dynamical uniaxial strength concerning quasi-static values. The increase was up to 2,2 times in CMET, 1,8 in RB, and 2,6 in QS. Additionally, the dynamic increase factor (DIF) indicates a strong strain rate dependency of the QS samples. This effect on RB and CMET samples is less evident. The data obtained with dynamic compressional testing indicates that both the increase in stiffness and dynamical compressive strength depends largely on the rock strain rate dependency. Further, we report a direct relationship between fracture patterns and the presence of veinlets. We suggest that fractures propagate through the matrix when the mechanical properties show a strong strain rate dependency, whereas are restricted to veinlets and veins when this dependence is less evident. Thus, as stress pulses enhance the stiffness, the energy dissipation increases, and the proneness of block formation is higher. These are conditions favoring strainbursts occurrence and might increase the severity of this phenomenon in underground excavations.\n               ","78":"\n                  Intersecting discontinuities are often encountered in rock engineering and sometimes associated with damaging geohazards. Our understanding of intersecting discontinuities instability remains vastly insufficient due to difficulties in comprehensively monitoring the failure process.

We subsequently build a three-dimensional numerical model and validate this model using the in-situ measurements by multipoint displacement meters. The numerical results demonstrate how the displacements of surrounding rock masses near the fault and the dyke increase and reveal possible causes, such as stress condition as well as geometry and orientation of rock discontinuities. We also discuss the correlation between the tempo-spatial distribution of MS events and the failure pattern of rock masses and confirm the weakened dyke as the main cause of the rock collapse.

We propose a mechanical model of cracks of 3 scale levels to investigate the pattern of crack propagation and possible failure modes produced. For modelling crack interaction between different scale levels, we model the unloading domain of influence of a single crack as the sphere with the diameter being the crack size drawn around the crack center. When the tip of a lower scale crack propagates into the influence domain of a crack of a higher scale level, the propagating crack of a lower scale will be unloaded and never grow from this tip. Propagation and coalescence of cracks of different scale levels for different initial crack concentration result in different patterns of cracks propagation and failure. For relatively lower initial crack concentrations, the interaction of cracks of the first scale level dominates, producing failure due to the coalescence of cracks of the first scale level. With the increase of the initial crack concentration, the coalescence of cracks of the third scale level dominates leading to failure at a higher initial concentration. With the further increase of the initial crack concentration, the failure is produced by the coalescence of cracks of the second scale level. At even higher initial crack concentrations the failure is again produced by the coalescence of cracks of the first scale level. The dynamic strength decreases with the increase in the initial crack concentration.\n               ","80":"\n                  Argillite rocks are often anisotropic due to the presence of microfractures, clay minerals, laminations, and bedding planes. Understanding the anisotropic behaviour of organic-rich argillite rocks is critical for their successful exploitation as unconventional reservoirs. In this study, the anisotropic rock properties of the argillite in the Naparima Hill Formation, Trinidad, an unconventional reservoir, was studied in laboratory experiments. A series of laboratory measurements including permeability, P- and S-wave velocities, and compressive strength were conducted at effective pressures of up to 130\u00a0MPa. The rock samples tested were collected from the Naparima Hill outcrop described by three lithofacies: siliceous calcareous mudstones, calcareous mudstone, and siliceous mudstones. The anisotropy of the argillite was determined by the ratio of the rock property measured perpendicular to the outcrop bedding to the rock property measured parallel to the outcrop bedding. For all the studied argillites, the permeability anisotropy ratios is about 2, while the P- and S-wave velocities anisotropy ratios, and compressive strength anisotropy ratios are close to 1, indicating that the rocks are fairly anisotropic. With increasing effective pressure, the permeability, velocities, and strength anisotropy ratios all decreased marginally. A comparison analysis reveals that the anisotropies of permeability and strength, anisotropies of P-velocity and permeability and anisotropies of S-velocity and permeability are all unrelated. However, anisotropies of P-wave velocity and strength, anisotropies of S-wave velocity and strength, and anisotropies of P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity anisotropy all have a 1:1 relationship. Overall, the results of the study suggest that the Naparima Hill argillite is weak to fairly anisotropic, which can be attributed to the low clay content, poor laminations, lack of foliation and few microfractures in the rocks.\n               ","81":"\n                  Tailings dams are potential facilities capable of failure, with the potential to generate high-impact environmental, economic, and social catastrophes given that they do collapse.

Using scaling arguments, a mathematical expression formed by three dimensionless groups including dimensionless yield stress, a modified Reynolds number, and the angle of the inclination of the system is proposed to explain the runout distance in tailings dams. The subsequent results show a good correlation between the variables, allowing us to deduce a high influence of the yield stress and the slope, albeit reflected both in the modified Reynolds number and the yield coefficient.

For this purpose, a new incremental variational mean field homogenization (IVMFH) method is first established. The novelty lies in the fact that the new formulation allows considering solid matrix obeying a nonlinear plastic yield criterion rather than the linear Drucker\u2013Prager one adopted in the previous work Zhao et\u00a0al.

To this end, a new optimization procedure is proposed to estimate the effective incremental potential involving a stress-dependent relation between volumetric and deviatoric parts of local plastic strain field of solid matrix. The proposed incremental variational model takes into account the effect of non-uniform distribution of local stress and strain fields in solid matrix by incorporating their first and second moments in the homogenization process. The proposed model is able to provide not only macroscopic but also local mechanical responses of porous rocks.

This study samples three types of slate and two types of schist to investigate the mechanical properties of foliation. A series of pull-off tests and direct shear tests are conducted on the foliations to obtain the tensile and shear strengths, and a failure criterion for foliation is proposed. The proposed foliation failure criterion exhibits a nonlinear trend in the low normal stress range, considers both tensile and shear strengths, and has three material parameters. The proposed criterion is extended to establish a failure criterion for foliated metamorphic rocks, considering various types of rocks under different orientation angles and confining pressures. For the foliated metamorphic rock failure criterion, a total of eight material parameters are required, which can be determined using the foliation pull-off tests, direct shear tests, and triaxial tests.

The obtained Young\u2019s modulus, compression strength, and P- and S-wave velocities highlight strong variations with depth. For example, at 14\u00a0m-depth, uniaxial maximal strength ranges from 13 to 123\u00a0MPa. In addition, at 16\u00a0m-depth, P-wave velocities are distributed from 3,650 to 5,700\u00a0m.s\u22121.

This last parameter is estimated from the P- and S- wave velocities, and ranges from 0 to 0.43, with an extremum value of 1.21 around 19\u00a0m-depth.

Microindentation was conducted to characterize the creep behavior of the THMC-treated specimens with the data analyzed by the Kelvin-Voigt (KV) and compliance methods, while X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were performed to analyze the compositional and microstructural changes respectively to aid interpretation of indentation measurements. Results show that the THMC treatments increase the creep rate by 46\u2013162%, owing to the treatment-induced softening that varies with the treatment time and distance from the fluid-rock interface, while the Young's modulus and hardness decrease with both the THMC-treatment and creep durations. The softened zones become more viscous, as reflected by the decreased KV model's viscoelastic coefficients for the softened specimens. The higher creep rate of the softened zones is primarily attributed to the weakening in cementation bond and increase in microscale porosity due to the dissolution of carbonates.

The normal force required by the disc cutter for breaking intact rock surfaces was observed to be greater than that for breaking the broken rock surfaces. Unlike in linear cutting, in multi disc rotary rock-breaking, the cutter applies lateral compression to the rock on both sides, thereby promoting crack extension and penetration. As the mounting radius of the disc cutter increases, the normal and rolling forces, as well as the cutting coefficient of the rolling force, increase; the side force decreases. Moreover, a low thrust and high torque are maintained by the cutterhead.\n               ","91":"\n                  The investigation of safe mud pressure window of horizontal wellbore drilled in the saturated rock by accounting for the combined effect of anisotropy and uncertainty is the main purpose of this work. To this aim, the deterministic solution of collapse and fracture initiation pressures are firstly presented in three cases that describe the behavior of wellbore: (1) immediately after drilling (i.e., undrained problem); (2) at long term due to the steady-state fluid flow (permeable boundary case) and (3) by neglecting the variation of initial pore pressure (i.e., impermeable boundary condition case). Based on these deterministic solutions, the key parameters of different sources of anisotropy (initial stress state, poro-elastic and strength properties of rock mass) are highlighted through sensitivity analysis. Then, the famous Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is undertaken to quantify the uncertainty effect on the probability of success of safe mud pressure window of the wellbore. We also present an adaptation of the Kriging metamodeling technique to study the stability of wellbore. In comparison with the referent solution of MCS, the Kriging metamodel provides a high accuracy and can be used as a performant tool for the probabilistic assessment of wellbore. The consideration of anisotropy combined with uncertainty, and the hydraulically boundary condition around wellbore in this work allows us to complete the contributions in the literature and confirm their strong effect on the design of wellbore.\n               ","92":"\n                  Laser scanning is an efficient approach for collecting rock mass point cloud scans to characterise structural discontinuities. However, developing computationally efficient and robust analytical workflows remains an open research problem. Existing semi-automated and automated approaches rely on point normals which are prone to mapping error when high variability exists in the local-support region. This study proposes a new automated algorithm that uses the spatial distribution of points on discontinuities to capture unique signatures in the form of sinusoidal waves. The discontinuities are then effectively characterised by clustering the amplitude and phase profiles of the sinusoidal waves. The presented amplitude and phase decomposition (APD) approach requires minimal pre-processing. Moreover, it can be applied directly to raw point clouds as filtering is inherently included through the fast Fourier transform (FFT) based decomposition of the signals. The method was evaluated on an underground tunnel dataset with exposed structural discontinuity planes. The efficacy of the developed approach was tested against manual segmentation using virtual compass plugin in open-source software (Cloud Compare), semi-automated open-source (discontinuity set extractor) and proprietary (Maptek PointStudio) software, and other automated algorithmic approaches based on point normal clustering and region growing. The APD approach produced the least error in estimating mean discontinuity dip angle and dip direction which was \u00b11.15\u00b0 and \u00b11.39\u00b0 with a dispersion error of \u00b12.24\u00b0 and \u00b11.54\u00b0, respectively.\n               ","93":"\n                  The measurement of in-situ stress is a critical prerequisite for the mining design and the stability analysis of surrounding rock in deep mining engineering. In this study, a novel re-oriented core acoustic emission (RCAE) method incorporating the non-oriented core ground re-orientation and AE techniques was proposed for in-situ stress measurement. First, the principle of non-oriented core ground re-orientation is established according to the spatial coupling relationship between the drilling trajectory and the core surface characteristics. Then, an innovative apparatus was designed for recovering the original spatial orientation of non-oriented cores. Furthermore, the measurement procedures of RCAE method are described in detail, involving suitability analysis, outdoor operations, core re-orientation, specimen preparation, AE test and stress calculation. Using this method, a case study for in-situ stress measurement was performed in an ultra-deep borehole (2360\u00a0m) of the Sanshandao gold mine, China. Meanwhile, the verifications of measurement accuracy were conducted based on the tectonic stress inversion and the underground overcoring method. The results show that the measurement accuracy of RCAE method is acceptable, especially the horizontal maximum principal stress and its azimuth measured are well matched with those measured by other methods. In addition, the field applications indicate that the in-borehole procedure of RCAE method only requires drilling trajectory measurement without excessive complex operations, and the adequate measuring depth of this method in the case area is up to 3841\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0521\u00a0m according to the damage stress threshold analysis. Therefore, the RCAE method could break through the challenges caused by the restricted measuring space and large measuring depth when no deep underground access exists.

Owing to the advantages of high heating efficiency and selective volume heating, microwaves have broad application prospects in fields such as unconventional low-permeability reservoir fracturing. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the mechanical behavior of rocks under true triaxial stress after microwave irradiation. In this study, true triaxial tests of sandstone under different microwave irradiation conditions were conducted. The results showed that the strength of the irradiated sandstone first increased and then decreased. The strength of the irradiated sandstone was significantly lower than that of the unirradiated sandstone. The pre-peak brittleness of the sandstone gradually increased with an increase in \u03c3\u2082. The brittleness of the irradiated samples was lower than that of the unirradiated samples. For the post-peak brittleness index of the sandstone, with the increase of \u03c3\u2082, the microwave irradiated and unirradiated sandstone both gradually decreased first and then slowly increased. The residual strength of the unirradiated sandstone showed a trend of first increasing and then stabilizing, while the residual strength of the irradiated sample showed a greater dispersion and fluctuation. And, the residual strength of sandstone first increased and then decreased with the increase of microwave duration. In addition, a new double logarithmic linear strength model was proposed, which is in good agreement with the experimental results. The true triaxial stress induced anisotropic damage and deformation of sandstone are critical to rock fracture. The stress difference induced by water vapor expansion and mineral thermal expansion is the main factor for microwave breaking water-bearing sandstone.

However, the shear characteristics of healed rock joints under high temperatures are still poorly understood. In this paper, to capture the thermal effect on the shear behavior of healed rock joints, a series of direct shear tests are performed with the aid of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope techniques. The testing results demonstrate that the shear resistance of the healed joints is slightly lower than that of the intact rock, but much greater than that of clean joints. Compared with intact rocks, the ductile failure characteristics of the healed joints after high temperature thermal treatment are more significant. The peak shear strength, shear stiffness and dilation angle of healed joints are greatly influenced by thermal treatment temperature, while the ultimate shear strength is almost independent on with temperatures. The influence of thermal treatment on shear resistance is attributed to the physical and chemical changes. The thermal decomposition of the filling minerals at around 400\u00a0\u00b0C is believed to be the main cause of the change in thermal-induced shear behavior of the healed joints.

Although a series of studies via lab testing and analytical modelling proved the importance of pretension in cable bolts, there is no systematic analysis to guide the optimal pretension values to be applied on cable bolts in different engineering geological conditions. Complicated geological conditions, such as anisotropic in-situ stress, bedding plane detachment and country rock deformation, cannot be fully represented in the lab or analytical work. In addition, field scale numerical models to investigate cable bolt performance and its interaction with various geological conditions are rare. This paper analyses the effect of pretension on the performance of cable bolts in underground coal mines via field scale numerical models, with considering different geological conditions (in-situ stress, bedding plane stiffness and rock mass properties). Numerical models were developed based on a case study mine in Australia with challenging ground conditions. The in-situ stress, properties of claystone and bedding planes are considered critical variables to be analysed. The results show higher pretension contributes to higher force along the cable bolt. Neutral points, where shear force in grout materials is zero, are used to describe the pretension-induced stress redistribution on cable bolts. Pretension also has a positive effect on roof and bedding plane management, resulting in a more stable roof condition. In addition, high pretension and high in-situ stress are more likely to result in cable-grout (CG) interface failure since the relative vertical displacement difference between cable bolts and the surrounding rock mass is higher. Once CG interface failure is generated, the pretension effect turns out to be negative, leading to severe roof sagging and bedding plane aperture.

Four statistical features (i.e., contrast, energy, correlation, and homogeneity) of the CT images were extracted to evaluate the internal damage evolution in coal. The results show that the contrast generally took a changing trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the closure, initiation, and expansion of the fractures, that is, it decreased slowly at the compaction stage, slightly increased at the elasticity stage, and drastically increased at the post-peak stage. On the contrary, the energy, correlation, and homogeneity showed a changing trend opposite to that of the contrast. The changing tendency of mean values of the four statistical features could be depicted by the Boltzmann function, and in addition, the statistical features followed Gaussian distribution during the complete stress-strain process. The maximum damage cross-section of the coal sample could be transferred with the increase of deformation in the coal sample, indicating that the final failure location may not be the maximum initial damage location. The fracture ratio measured by the binarization and K-Means clustering algorithm methods typical showed three changing stages (i.e., a slow reduction process, a slight increase process, and a dramatic increase process) and could be used to reflect the meso-damage development process in coal at different deformation stages.\n               ","99":"\n                  Measuring the intrinsic fracture properties of quasi-brittle materials like rocks is of great importance and at the same time a major issue for engineers.

The 4D-LSM has been used for a wide range of rock engineering applications, however its ability for simulating direct shear tests has not been investigated in detail. The material strength parameters were calibrated using uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) tests on granite specimens while the joint parameters were calibrated from direct shear tests on saw-cut UCS specimens and rock joints containing a single triangular asperity. From UCS tests, a calibration method is proposed to adjust the excessive machine deformation due to the high brittleness of granite, which is further applied to the direct shear test results. It was found that the strength of rock joints is strongly influenced by the intact rock properties. To investigate the influence of joint geometry and rock heterogeneity, three joint asperity angles and five heterogeneous models were simulated using the calibrated 4D-LSM model. Simulation results were able to capture the influence of different joint asperity angles on the shear strength and failure mechanism as reported in previous experimental and numerical studies. With larger asperity angles, higher shear strengths were obtained. Meanwhile, rock heterogeneity represented by particles with lower strength will reduce the shear strength and alter the failure mechanism, especially at a high porosity. This strength reduction was observed to be greater for steep-angle asperities and becomes less significant for flatter asperities. Similar conclusions were also obtained based on the simulations of natural joint profiles. From these findings, it is suggested that the characterisation of rock heterogeneity is crucial to estimate the strength of rock joints.

During the grouting process, the NMR signal characteristics of the grout were monitored in real-time, and the parameters such as the slurry injection volume, effective grouting time and grout filling speed were comprehensively analyzed under various temperatures, confining pressures, flow velocities and numbers of fractures. The results show that the final injection amount of the grout decreases with increasing temperature and confining pressure. The effective grouting time is inversely proportional to the flow velocity, while it is positively related to the temperature. The filling speed decreases with increasing the temperature and confining pressure, while it increases with increasing the grout flow velocity. Compared to the single fractured sample, the sample with more fractures is injected with more grout slurry in a shorter effective grouting time and a higher filling speed. Under the conditions of high confining pressure (e.g., 15\u00a0MPa) or high flow velocity (e.g., \u22655\u00a0ml\/min), the grout slurry preferentially transports into the micropores, and then the mesopores and macropores.

Fractures initiate in tension based on a damage criterion and grow by evaluating stress intensity factors at each fracture tip. Tip propagation is multi-modal, resulting in final fracture patterns that are representative of both tensile and shear failure. Their geometries are represented by smooth parametric surfaces, which evolve during growth using lofting.

Whereas tunnel orientation influences the relative locations where fractures initiate with respect to the tunnel floor, fracture growth and its final extent is determined by the relative magnitudes of the in situ stresses. Higher stress differential causes higher spalling depths, but in all cases, failure extent is localised to the borehole vicinity, not exceeding one borehole radius. The cylindrical borehole is modified at the top to provide an access ramp for the spent fuel canisters and fracture growth around several deposition boreholes is simulated for borehole tops having cylindrical, conical, and wedge shapes. The enlargement of the borehole top induces higher stress concentrations at the borehole\u2013tunnel junction, increasing the severity of spalling closer to the tunnel floor.

There exist several hurdles in the engineering implementations of such geothermal systems. One such hurdle is the accurate monitoring of the fracture networks created in subsurface through hydraulic stimulation of these systems. Micro seismicity associated with the stimulation is the primary means to locate the event hypocenters for estimating the stimulated rock volume. Existing methods for location the hypocenters are restricted to only the highest amplitude impulsive signals that are simultaneously detected on several sensors. Consequently, a large portion (usually \u223c99%) of the measurements are left unused. In this paper, an unsupervised manifold-approximation followed by clustering of 3-component accelerometer data is used to analyze the seismicity recorded on a monitoring well. With this method, a larger portion of the measured signal is used for the monitoring of the hydraulic fracture network. We analyze the EGS Collab experiment 1 microseismic data, recorded at the Sanford Underground Research Facility, South Dakota. Using the data from a single three-component accelerometer, the polarization features viz. Azimuth, incidence, rectilinearity, and planarity are used as inputs for the unsupervised manifold approximation followed by clustering. Our study shows that density-based clusters in the projected 3D space correspond to distinct types of hydraulically fractured zones around the injection point. We show that the temporal evolution of these clusters can be used to track fracture creation and propagation.\n               ","109":"\n                  This study attempts to identify the rock cutting efficiency by several descriptor methods of chip size distribution such as coarseness index, Rossin-Rammler function, and fractal function by sieve analysis.

The cutting tests were performed by using a conical pick on five sandstones with uniaxial compressive strength varying from 17.91 to 85.98\u00a0MPa. Different levels of cutting depth and line spacing were applied in the course of the tests. The specific energy was also calculated. Based on sieve analysis of the chips collected after the cutting tests, the relationships between the distribution parameters of rock chips and cutting parameters including depth of cut, line spacing, and specific energy were investigated. In this context, we aimed to determine the capability of each chip size distribution method and to associate with the rock cutting efficiency, in which some of the major parameters in consideration of the rock cutting process are included. Based on the statistical analyses, several regression equations were proposed according to relieved and unrelieved cutting modes. In conclusion, we found that there are significant relationships between depth of cut and coarseness index, size parameter and distribution parameter. The coarseness index is found to be very reliable to evaluate the cutting efficiency and Rosin-Rammler function is an alternative practical method to be utilized. The rock chips conform to the fractal distribution law.

However, fewer studies attempt to understand borehole failure in more realistic rocks characterized by both elastic and strength anisotropy. A program to calculate the failure pattern in elastic and strength anisotropic rocks is developed. The program combines a recent algorithm for calculating stress concentrations around a borehole within an anisotropic rock mass with anisotropic rock strength as applied through differing failure criteria. Shear failure in the rock matrix and the weak plane are examined based on Jaeger\u2019s single plane of weakness theory. Results from test models clearly indicate that failure in the weak plane complicates the failure pattern around the wellbore, resulting in that the breakout orientation cannot correctly represent the minimum horizontal stress orientation as commonly suggested for a vertical wellbore aligned with the principal stresses.

Then, one of the main tasks of mining design and planning is to identify, avoid and\/or control when and in what magnitude this finer material could be extracted at drawpoints. Studies have been done regarding fine material migration in mining; however, recent studies have challenged current understanding about the main variables that control its mechanisms. This research aims to clarify some of the main variables controlling fine material migration through laboratory experiments of a block cave column during flow, scaled 1:50. Here, the variables studied are the ratio between the size of coarse and fine material, the particle-size-distribution of coarse material, the type of draw, and amount and location of fine material. Experimental results show that the ratio between coarse and fine material size is one of the more relevant variables: when this ratio increases, fine material migration also increases. Additionally, the coarse particle-size distribution has an important influence on fine material migration. A higher coefficient of uniformity (d60\/d10) will delay fine material migration. For example, when the coefficient of uniformity changed from 1.5 to 3.8, the amount of coarse material extracted before the fine material changed from 69% to 143%. Additionally, the presence of fine material does not appear related to changes in the extraction zone's final geometry as long as coarse material is drawn first.

Fracture initiation, accumulation, propagation, and the corresponding stress-deformation behavior of polycrystalline rocks are sensitive to the crystallographic spatial distribution and the micro-strength parameters of mineral contacts. The clustering of mineral grains tends to induce more significant local stresses while the stress fluctuations in RDP models are more widely distributed and isolated, leading to different microcracking behavior furtherly affected by the superimposed effect of heterogeneous contact properties. Therefore, it is essential to use DIP methods to model heterogeneous rocks if the grain-scale mechanical behavior is of interest.

Then, Brazilian splitting tests were carried out on the bedding coal, and influences of cryogenic cooling fracturing and bedding orientation on mechanical properties and fracture morphology of the bedding coal were analyzed. The results show that the micro-structure of the coal is obviously damaged under the LN2 cooling due to the thermal tensile stress. The P-wave velocity, tensile strength, Brazilian splitting modulus, and brittleness index of the coal sample have significant anisotropic characteristics and their values are reduced after the LN2 cooling. The weakening degree in mechanical characteristics of the coal induced by the LN2 cooling is also closely related to the bedding direction of the coal. After the LN2 cooling treatment, the maximum and minimum reduction of the tensile strength is at the bedding angle 0\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, respectively, with the reduction of 55.81% and 6.98%, respectively.

For example, the 2008\u00a0Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake in China has triggered more than 60,000 landslides in the Longmenshan fault zone,\n16\n and the 2015 7.8 Mw Gorkha earthquake in Nepal has triggered over 21,000 landslides,\n17\n leading to significant loss of human lives and properties. The subsequent secondary hazards, such as debris flows and landslides, can last for a relatively long period of time as a huge number of earthquake-induced fractures and cracks in slopes pre-condition geo-hazards in snowmelt or rainy and monsoon seasons.\n18\u201321\n Furthermore, it is expected that ground shaking and consequent rock mass damage control both volume and grain size of debris available for transport in rivers, affecting the river geometry and transport capacity in downstream regions.\n22\n\n\nIn the past several decades, great efforts have been devoted to study the mechanism of slope failure and the subsequent runout, while little has been done to investigate the slope fracturing process. Site investigations have shown that the seismic impact could create or activate a huge number of persistent discontinuities and pre-existing open fault planes in the upper portion of the slope, while the slope toe region can remain relatively intact.\n23\n This is due mainly to site effects amplifying the ground motion near the crest and consequently most coseismic landslides mainly occur in the upper slope sectors.\n11\n\n,\n\n13\n As stated in Ref. 24, earthquake shaking can effectively loosen and weaken the slope, facilitating the infiltration of water during rainfall. The weathering by water infiltration can reduce effectively the strength of slope materials.\n25\n As a result, the material strength becomes highly heterogeneous and increases with depth.\n26\n These conditions are crucial for subsequent catastrophic landslides occurring in the upper slope sector, where strong shaking, unloading and weathering effects are dominant. Due to the long recurrence time and unpredictable nature of earthquakes, direct field-based investigations of their impact on slope damage and failure are difficult, and numerical simulations can be an effective research method forward. Gischig et al.\n27\n investigated the mechanism of seismically induced rock mass damage and its influence on slope progressive failure via 2D distinct-element modellings (DEM). Their results confirmed the important role of repeated earthquake activity over time in destabilizing a strong and competent rock slope by progressive fracturing. The pre-existing slope damages were found to dominate the fracturing and displacement that a certain earthquake can cause. The slope fracturing and post-failure landslide dynamics were further analysed by Zhao & Crosta\n28\n using the 3D DEM simulations, showing the slope failure at the peak ground seismic acceleration when a sudden increase of tensile and shear stresses damaged the particle cementations.\nFor numerical simulations, most traditional slope stability and landslide dynamics models, such as the limit equilibrium method, finite element and meshfree analysis, have neglected or not properly account the spatial variability of material properties due partly to the convenience of model configurations.\n29\n Though these simplified models may capture some features of specific slope failure events, they cannot quantify the spatial variability and uncertainty of material properties (e.g. strength, elastic modulus, fracture distribution and permeability). The spatial heterogeneity affects crucially how and where a slope may fail under external loadings. For example, under earthquake impacts, a slope may fail preferentially along the weak zones as the locally concentrated stress can easily exceed the material strength. As a result, these models may produce unrealistically high\/low probabilities of slope failure, leading to costly engineering design or highly risky constructions. Recent advancements in numerical modelling employ the random field theory (RFT) to investigate the variability of slope properties as multi-dimensional and multi-variate random fields.\n30\n Considering the discontinuous nature of geomaterials, the RFT has been coupled with DEM to study the fracturing and large deformation processes of heterogeneous rock masses.\n31\n\n\nTherefore, an in-depth understanding of slope fracturing mechanism and its influence on slope stability and landscape evolutions under seismic loading is highly necessary. In this respect, the current research has employed an RFT-DEM coupling approach to investigate the response of a rocky slope under transient earthquake loading. The paper is organized as follows: in section 2, the RFT-DEM theory and model configuration are illustrated. In section 3, the obtained numerical results of seismic induced slope fracturing process are presented. Section 4 presents the discussions on modelling timescale, slope fragmentation and multiple earthquake impacts.\n\n\n2\nMethodology and model configuration\n\n2.1\nRFT-DEM theory\nThe RFT-DEM coupling model was developed based on the open-source DEM code ESyS-Particle.\n32\n In DEM, the dynamics of each individual particle is governed by the Newton's second law of motion and the interactions between particles are computed by a simple linear elastic spring contact model. The rocky slope is represented as a collection of densely packed spherical rigid particles, which are stressed under gravity and cemented together by the so-called parallel bond model (PBM).\n33\n\n,\n\n34\n In the PBM model, the bonding forces are computed by the linear-elastic spring model and the relative displacements are obtained through the representation of spatial rotation by unit quaternions. The interparticle cementation (i.e. bond in DEM) would break when the combined loads exceed its bonding strength capacity, as determined by Eq.

Based on this model, the slope internal fractures would occur naturally when the loading stress exceeds the particle bonding strength at any specific location. This approach avoids the use of some phenomenological constitutive laws, such as those used in conventional continuum modelling.\nOnce the interparticle bond breaks, the particles become dispersed and interact with each other via the linear-elastic spring contact model and interparticle friction. The related fundamental DEM theory and rigorous calibrations can be found in Ref. 35 and will not be repeated herein.\nIn DEM, the total potential energy (E\n\np\n) of a granular system is defined as the summation of the potential energy of individual particles with respect to the elevation base, as:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nE\np\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\n\nm\ni\n\ng\n\nH\ni\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere N is the total number of particles in the model; m\n\ni\n and H\n\ni\n are the mass and elevation height of a particle i, respectively; g\u00a0=\u00a09.81\u00a0m\/s2 is the gravitational acceleration.\nThe kinetic energy is calculated as the summation of the translational and rotational kinetic energy of all particles in the granular system,\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nE\nk\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\n(\n\n\nm\ni\n\n\n\n|\n\nv\ni\n\n|\n\n2\n\n+\n\nI\ni\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u03c9\ni\n\n|\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere I\n\ni\n is the momentum of inertia; v\n\ni\n and \u03c9\n\ni\n are the linear and angular velocities of particle i.\nThe elastic energy stored in each individual bond, E\n\nb\n, is calculated as follows:\n\n(4)\n\n\nE\nb\n\n=\n\n\nF\n\nb\nn\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\nK\n\nb\nn\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nF\n\nb\ns\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\nK\n\nb\ns\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nM\nb\n2\n\n\n2\n\nK\nb\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nM\nt\n2\n\n\n2\n\nK\nt\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere K\n\nbn\n, K\n\nbs\n, K\n\nb\n and K\n\nt\n are the stiffnesses of interparticle bonding interactions in the normal, shear, bending and twisting directions, as calculated from the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the particle contact and bond.\n35\n Once a bond breaks (see the criterion in Eq. (1)), its elastic energy (E\n\nb\n) would be released completely. The released energy was recorded at each iteration time step in the DEM simulation for all broken bonds. The cumulative energy released from the beginning to the current simulation time is defined as the slope fragmentation energy, E\n\nf\n.\nAfter bond breakage, the elastic energy stored at a particle contact, E\n\nc\n, is calculated as follows:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nE\nc\n\n\n=\n\n\nF\nn\n\n\n2\n\nK\nn\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nF\ns\n\n\n2\n\nK\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere F\n\nn\n, F\n\ns\n are the normal and shear contact forces; K\n\nn\n, K\n\ns\n are the stiffnesses of interparticle contact interaction in the normal and shear directions, respectively.\nThe cumulative energy dissipation due to frictional and damping forces at particle contacts are computed incrementally as:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\nE\n\nf\nr\ni\nc\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\nE\n\nf\nr\ni\nc\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\n\nN\nc\n\n\n\nf\nj\n\n\u0394\n\nu\n\ns\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\n\nE\nd\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\nE\nd\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\n\nN\nc\n\n\n\nF\n\nd\nj\n\n\n\u0394\n\nu\n\nn\nj\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nE\n\nf\nr\ni\nc\n\ni\n\n\n and \n\n\nE\n\nf\nr\ni\nc\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n are the cumulative energy dissipations by friction at the current and previous time steps; \n\n\nf\nj\n\n\n and \n\n\u0394\n\nu\n\ns\nj\n\n\n\n are the friction force and incremental sliding displacement for the jth contact; \n\n\nE\nd\ni\n\n\n and \n\n\nE\nd\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n are the cumulative energy dissipations by damping force at the current and previous time steps; \n\n\nF\n\nd\nj\n\n\n\n and \n\n\u0394\n\nu\n\nn\nj\n\n\n\n are the damping force and incremental normal displacement at contact j; N\n\nc\n is the total number of particle contacts in the model. To generalize the results, all energy components are normalized by the total initial potential energy (E\n\np0\n, at the beginning of the simulation).\n36\n\n\nIn RFT, the material properties are considered as a series of random values initially generated at the nodal points of the discretized staggered domain grids, following the standard Gaussian distribution pattern. Then, the exact material properties at the discrete particle centres are estimated linearly based on the values at the surrounding nodal points, through a series of randomized translations and rotations from one realization to the next.\n30\n In this approach, these random values are mutually correlated by a specified correlation length (i.e. scale of fluctuation), such that the properties of adjacent soil particles as variables within this length scale do not differ too much as those further apart. Once the random fields are generated, they are imported into DEM as the distribution of initial material properties of the slope model. In this research, 5400 DEM simulations have been performed on the same granular assembly, but with different realizations of slope properties. It is assumed that the number of simulations is large enough for obtaining statistically reliable results.\n\n\n2.2\nModel configuration\nThe inclination of natural rock slopes could range from about 30\u00b0 for very poor-quality rock masses to near vertical for shallow pits or rocky cliffs in good-quality rock.\n37\n Inclination has been reported as one of the controlling factors in rock slope design. In this research, a fixed slope inclination angle of 60\u00b0 was first used in DEM simulations to investigate the slope material heterogeneity effects. The crest width and volume of this slope were denoted as w0 and V0. Then, the slope geometric effects were analysed by varying the slope inclination angle from 30\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 to account for the wide range of slope inclinations of natural slopes, while maintaining either a constant crest width (as w0) or a constant slope volume (as V0). In these tests, the slope height was kept constant as 300\u00a0m.\nThe slope inclined at 60\u00b0 had a symmetrical isosceles trapezoid shape with the dimensions of 600\u00a0m in base length and 300\u00a0m in height (see Fig. 1\n (a, c)). The slope geometry was configured according to the field observations by Elsen & Tingley\n38\n that most of the mountains have the \u201chourglass\u201d shape, where they slope steeply upwards, before flattening out into broad high plains. Indeed, the adopted slope geometry is far simpler than the reality. However, it can effectively reduce the influence of irregular slope topography on the dynamics of slope failure during seismic wave propagations. In this study, a 2D simulation condition is adopted in order to better visualize the fracturing process while reducing the computational cost. The 2D simulations have been widely used in slope stability analyses\n6\n\n,\n\n27\n\n,\n\n39\n to provide initial results on slope evolution.\nThe rocky slope consists of densely packed spherical particles of diameters in a narrow range of [1.9, 2.0] m. These particles have sizes comparable to real rock mass blocks, and the interparticle bond could effectively represent the rock bridges between adjacent blocks\/particles, contributing some cohesion to the rock mass.\n28\n The rock type is assumed to be sandstones which are typical for landslides and rock avalanches occurred during\/after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Southwest China.\n40\n In an idealized rocky slope, the mean particle bonding strength (\n\n\nc\n\u203e\n\n\n) is assumed to increase linearly with depth and distance from the slope surface to account for the strength degradation due to weathering, as with various field investigation results.\n26\n\n,\n\n41\n\n,\n\n42\n As one of the key geomechanical parameters, the uniaxial compression strength (UCS) of rock is considered to have the most significant influence on slope stability.\n39\n In this study, the peak value of mean particle bonding strength (\n\n\nc\n\u203e\n\n\n) at the slope base was set as 82.5\u00a0MPa according to the published experimental data of sandstone uniaxial compression strength.\n43\n However, due to the heterogeneity of slope formation (e.g. fractures and weak layers), the rock strength varies widely within the slope and the weak zones normally have much lower strengths than the mean value. It has been reported that the UCS of sandstone can span a wide range from 5\u00a0MPa to over 150\u00a0MPa, depending on the local material conditions, such as composition, porosity, cementation and saturation.\n44\n To consider this variability, it is assumed that the variation of particle bonding strength (c\u2019) in DEM is 20% of the peak bonding strength, as represented by a typical random field in Fig. 1(a). The exact particle bonding strength (c) is thus computed as c\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\nc\n\u203e\n\n\n + c\u2019, as shown in Fig. 1(c) for a possible distribution. The corresponding variations of particle bonding strength along the depth at six representative cross-sections are shown in Fig. 1(d). The curves clearly show the fluctuation of particle bonding strengths about the mean value, which is similar to typical site investigation results.\n26\n\n,\n\n45\n\n,\n\n46\n\n\nThe spatial correlation length of c\u2019 was set as 10\u00a0m, which accounts for the existing published data in a wide range of 0.1\u2013200\u00a0m\n46\n\n,\n\n47\n and the relatively large particle size (\u223c2\u00a0m) used in the DEM model. The distribution of the random variable c\u2019 follows well the standard normal distribution as shown Fig. 1(b). According to Ref. 48, using the intermediate value of correlation length, the slope is not homogeneous and anomalies, such that the locations of weak zones would effectively control the probability of slope failure. In this work, the DEM analysis can \u201cseek out\u201d the weakest path through the slope during the fracturing process. As this study mainly focuses on the characteristics of slope fracturing for a typical model configuration, the sensitivity of spatial correlation length on the slope fracturing process is not analysed. However, it is apparent that this parameter will influence the characteristics of slope fractures. To simplify the analysis, the elastic moduli of particle bonding and contacts are set the same as a constant value of 10.5\u00a0GPa.\n\nFig. 2\n shows the ground accelerations and displacements used in the DEM simulations, which is modified from the Wenchuan earthquake records obtained from the seismic station at Qingping town (31.54564\u00b0N, 104.1142\u00b0E, Mianzhu County, China). The peak ground acceleration (PGA) recorded in the EW and UD directions were 0.84\u00a0g and 0.63\u00a0g, respectively (see Fig. 2(a)). To shorten the simulation time, the intense ground shaking period of the original 50\u00a0s was reframed into a 5-s period. This approach effectively speeds up the DEM simulation by 10 times. The raw data of ground acceleration was first processed by high-pass filter (with the cut-off frequency in the range of [0.2, 20] Hz) and baseline correction to remove the signal noise. Then, the accelerations were double integrated to produce the ground displacements. For the 2D DEM simulations, the EW and UD components of ground displacements were applied at the base of the slope in the horizontal and vertical directions as the movable boundary conditions. Though discrepancy between numerical simulation and field data exists, the DEM model can effectively capture the continuous ground shaking at a relatively low computational cost. It is assumed that this approach can reveal the general characteristics of seismic induced slope fracturing process.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nIn the analysis, the evolution of slope fracturing induced by a transient earthquake for simulations using different material strengths and slope geometries were investigated. The DEM simulation using uniform interparticle bonding strengths (i.e. no random variation introduced) was also included (termed \u201cuniform slope\u201d) for comparison purpose. An idealized intact and unbreakable uniform slope was used in analysing the ground amplification effects, while the brittle slopes (both heterogeneous and uniform slopes) were used in the rest of analyses. The results will be presented in terms of damage index (D), nominal fragment size (d) and slope energy components.\n\n3.1\nGround displacement\nThe ground amplification effect at different locations of an intact slope can provide useful information on where and how the cracks would occur. To understand this, an unbreakable uniform slope was employed in the DEM simulations using an extremely high interparticle bonding strength (i.e. 1010 GPa), such that no bond breakage was allowed during the simulation. Fig. 3\n shows the predicted cumulative ground displacement at seven different measurement locations at the base (B1), middle (M1, M2, M3) and top (T1, T2, T3) sectors of the slope, respectively. The displacement at the slope base (B1) corresponds to the input of the movable DEM boundary condition. For both the EW and UD directions, the ground displacement increased with the height and the slope surface normally had much larger displacements than the inner slope. The strongest ground displacement amplification occurred during 1\u20132.5s, when intense base excitations were persistent. The peak magnitudes of ground surface displacements occurred at the slope crest surface and were up to 8 times the slope base displacements in the EW and UD directions, respectively. The peak values always occurred shortly after the base excitation reached its peak, due to the delay of elastic wave propagation within the slope. At any specific time, the magnitude and direction of ground displacements of these locations were never synchronized. For the EW component, locations at the same elevation showed very similar pattern (e.g. M1, M2 and M3), despite of small differences in the displacement magnitude. For the UD component, very large differential ground displacements existed at these locations. At some instants (e.g. 1\u20131.5\u00a0s, 2\u20132.25s), locations at the same elevation height had displacements in completely opposite directions (e.g. T1 and T3). As a result, fractures were likely to occur along the vertical or sub-vertical directions (see the distribution of fractures in Fig. 4\n). The numerical simulation can qualitatively match the results reported in Ref. 6 that the cumulative slope displacement could be amplified significantly near the slope free surface.\n\n\n3.2\nCharacteristics of slope fracturing\n\nFig. 4 illustrates the evolution of internal fracturing process for a typical heterogenous slope (the input random field of particle bonding strength is shown in Fig. 1(c)). The slope internal damage is quantified by the damage index, D, defined as the ratio of the cumulative number of bonds broken during the simulation to the total number of bonds in the model before the test. The damage was firstly initiated at around 1\u00a0s near the left crest region where the amplification of ground displacement and ridge effect are significant (see Fig. 3). Once the initial cracks occurred, the subsequent damages would develop preferably close to these existing damaged zones, with a systematic opening of fractures sub-perpendicular to the slope surface. As stated in Ref. 23, this peculiar pattern of fractures creates meso-scale anisotropy in the bulk rock mass elasticity, such that the slope becomes more deformable parallel to the potential failure direction. As the ground shaking intensity increased, more small cracks occurred in the left and upper regions of the slope. Correspondingly, the damage index increased rapidly from 2.3% to 6.6% within 0.25\u00a0s. The cracks propagated preferably along the weak zones along different directions where the interparticle bonds have low strengths in the random field. These small cracks quickly nucleated and grew to completion to form interconnected fracturing zones, which consequently split the slope into a series of rock fragments. Only few cracks occurred at the bottom region of the slope due to the high rock strength and low ground surface amplifications. The slope fracturing process occurred mainly between 1 and 2\u00a0s when the ground seismic loading intensity was very high. After t\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0s, no appreciable new fracture was observed. The open cracks orientated preferentially along the vertical and sub-vertical directions, which is similar to the numerical results reported in Refs. 6,27 and field observations of some giant landslides triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Ref. 49. The occurrence of interconnected and thoroughgoing fractures within the slope (see Fig. 4(c\u2013f)) could potentially lead to subsequent loose mass flow and catastrophic deep-seated landslides, which was classified as \u201ctension-shattering failure\u201d in Ref. 49.\n\nFig. 5\n(a) illustrates the evolution of slope damage index (D) with time for both heterogeneous and uniform slopes. Before t\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0s, there was no slope damage as the ground shaking intensity was negligibly small. Then, D increased slightly as the EW component of ground shaking started to increase suddenly, while the UD component still remained very small. The time for slope damage initiation varied for different simulations as determined by the random fields of the particle bonding strength. The uniform slope can effectively resist the fracture initiation and the damage occurred the latest at t\u00a0=\u00a00.88\u00a0s when the ground shaking intensity started to rise abruptly. From t\u00a0=\u00a00.88\u00a0s\u20131.5\u00a0s, D increased almost linearly to reach a relatively high value of about 7%\u20139%. In this process, the majority of slope damages occurred as a result of intense ground shaking. After t\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0s, D increased slowly even though the ground accelerations were still intense. This is because the wide-spread fractures can effectively reduce the propagation of seismic wave within the slope. A large portion of slope kinetic energy has been dissipated through bond breakage and the frictional interactions between the rock fragments (see Figure A1 in the Supplementary Information). In addition, some of the rock fragments detaching from the slope would not suffer from any further shaking-induced damages and on the other hand, the remaining slope of strong intact bedrock could also resist the seismic loading. The slope damage index remained unchanged after t\u00a0=\u00a02.0\u00a0s for all simulations. The distribution of the final value of D follows well the normal distribution pattern as shown in Fig. 5(b). The mean value (D\n\n50\n) is 9.15% which approximately equals that of a uniform slope (D\u00a0=\u00a09.16%), indicating that the simulation using a uniform slope can represent the average characteristics of slope fracturing process. The 5th and 95th percentiles of the final slope damage index in the distribution are 8.66% and 9.66%, respectively. These two values can be used to evaluate the potential risks of subsequent slope failure. To reveal the characteristics of rock fragments, the simulations of 5th, 50th, 95th percentiles of final damage index are further analysed below.\nAfter the earthquake loading, the slope was highly fractured. The widespread discontinuities delineated randomly shaped and sized rock fragments. In the analysis, a granular agglomerate was only considered as a rock fragment if it consisted of more than 10 particles. Fig. 6\n illustrates the collection of fragments for the simulations of 5th, 50th, 95th percentiles of final damage index (see Fig. 5(b)) and the uniform slope. For these tests, the largest fragments were consistently found at the slope base, with highly irregular shapes. These fragments were considered as the bedrock under the direct earthquake loading impact. Other fragments had roughly blocky shapes. The fragment size increased with depth, with the majority of fine fragments concentrated near the upper crest region. These fragments can be considered as at high risks of potential falling\/detachment if further disturbances such as earthquakes or rainfall occur, because of the relatively high damage intensity and large deformations. The lower region of the slope could fail by translational sliding on stepped surfaces. These numerical findings are in accordance with the field observations reported in Ref. 23. The uniform slope (Fig. 6(d)) had a fragment distribution pattern similar to the heterogeneous slope and the fragment sizes were comparable to those in Fig. 6(b). In the uniform slope, the fragmentation concentrated mainly in several large cracks in the middle and upper sectors of the ridge, with less complete fractures but wider openings than the heterogeneous slopes. Thus, the uniform slope was relatively more stable than the heterogeneous slopes during the simulated earthquake loading.\nIn the analysis, the nominal fragment size was defined as \n\nd\n=\n\n\n\nA\nf\n\n\/\n\nA\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n, with A\n\nf\n being the area of the fragment, and A\n\n0\n being the area of whole rock slope prior to seismic impact in a 2D analysis. Fig. 7\n illustrates the distribution of fragment size with height within the slope. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the upper limit of fragment size decreased gradually with the increase of elevation within the slope (see the bold dashed line). A large number of fine fragments concentrated at the upper sector of the slope ridge, indicating lower confinement and intense slope fragmentation there. At the toe and upper sectors of the slope ridge, the fragment size decreased gradually as the slope damage index increased from 5th to 95th percentiles (see the regions B and U in Fig. 7). However, in the middle region (M), such pattern is not clear. In general, the number of fragments increased quickly with the slope damage index due to the widespread internal fractures. As the damage index increases from 50th to 95th percentiles, there is a slight decrease in fragments number. This is mainly because at high slope damage, more fine particles and fragments (with less than 10 constituent particles) were produced, reducing the number of relatively large fragments. The statistics of fragments number along the height in Fig. 7(b) shows that the majority of rock fragments were concentrated at the upper sector of the slope. The fragments number reduced quickly towards the middle and base regions of the slope, indicating that the slope bedrock can largely maintain the initial intact structure during the earthquake loading.\nBased on the identification of rock fragments after the earthquake event, the nominal fragment size distributions (FSD) for all tests can be analysed, as shown in Fig. 8\n(a). For different tests, the percentages of small fragments were very close, while large discrepancy existed for large fragments as controlled by the random fields of particle bonding strength. A significant mass percentage of relatively large (d\u00a0>\u00a00.1) fragments existed in these simulations, while they only amount to less than 30% in number. The numerical results can be best fitted by the Weibull's cumulative distribution function (WeibullCDF), as:\n\n(8)\n\n\nP\n\n=\n\nA\n\n(\n\n1\n\n\u2212\n\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\n\n(\n\nd\n\/\na\n\n)\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n+\n\n\nP\n0\n\n\n\n\nwhere P is the percentage of fragment size finer than the nominal size d; a, b, A and P\n\n0\n are fitting parameters.\nAs a comparison, Fig. 8(b) summarized the particle\/fragment size distributions from site investigations on the freshly deposited Tangjiashan landslide dam in Southwest China,\n50\n on natural slopes in California\n51\n and recent landslide deposits in Taiwan.\n52\n All these studies were conducted in seismic active regions and thus can be considered comparable and useful to this research. It is evident that the natural debris fragments have widespread particle size distributions, which can also be best fitted by the Weibull's cumulative distribution function. As the current DEM simulations only focused on the relatively large debris fragments, Fig. 8(a) illustrates a very narrow range of FSD, similar to the data reported in Ref. 51 and Ref. 52. On the other hand, Chang & Zhang\n50\n focused on characterizing the geotechnical properties of soil deposits for a much wider range of particle sizes, and especially for a rock avalanche deposit where an additional fragmentation component is present due to long runout. Both numerical simulations of this study and site investigations indicate that the fragment size distribution of fractured slopes follows well the Weibull's cumulative distribution pattern.\nFor a practical analysis, the fragments of nominal size less than 0.1 or the cumulative mass percentage less than 20% can be considered as critical for hazard assessment, because small fragments located at the slope crest and surface (see Figs. 6 and 7) are more prone to collapse from the slope and generate landslides\/rockfalls with respect to the larger ones. The small and shallow landslides have also been reported to have the highest occurrence frequency among all kinds of earthquake induced failures.\n4\n\n,\n\n5\n As shown in Fig. 9\n(a), in all tests, the cumulative mass percentage (P) of fragments with nominal size finer than 0.1 followed well the normal distribution pattern, with the majority distributed in the range of 12.1% (P\n\n5\n) to 20.6% (P\n\n95\n) of the total slope mass. The mean value of fragment mass percentage was 16.2%. For fine fragments of cumulative mass percentage less than 20%, the distribution of nominal size is shown in Fig. 9(b), which follow approximately the normal distribution with the mean value being 0.114. The fragments of an accumulative mass 20% of the slope had the nominal size less than 0.134 (d\n\n95\n). Therefore, in designing the slopes or analysing related hazards, the 95th percentile values in these statistics (i.e. P\n\n95\n and d\n\n95\n) could be used to evaluate the rockfall\/slide risks.\n\n\n3.3\nEnergy evolution\nAnalysis of energy evolution is important for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of slope failure and post-failure landslide dynamics. Fig. 10\n illustrates the evolutions of slope kinetic energy and fragmentation energy (energy released during the fracturing process) for simulations using different random fields. The kinetic energy increased and fluctuated slightly at the beginning of the simulation due to negligible ground accelerations (see Fig. 2). At the beginning, the heterogeneous and uniform slopes all exhibited the same pattern of kinetic energy evolution as no slope damage had occurred yet. After t\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0s, the intense ground shaking led to the increase of slope kinetic energy, which quickly reached the peak value within a short time (\u223c1\u00a0s). Correspondingly, induced slope damage also quickly approached the peak values (see Fig. 5). In this process, clear discrepancy of kinetic energy evolution occurred as determined by the geometry and dynamics of individual slope fragments. In general, once a rock fragment detached from the slope, its dynamics would be governed primarily by the gravity and collision with other fragments, instead of the earthquake loading. This was effectively a random process. Therefore, the evolutions of E\n\nk\n for a series of simulations did not follow any clear pattern (see E\n\nk\n of the uniform and heterogeneous slopes of 5th, 95th percentiles of damage index). After reaching the peak value, E\n\nk\n decreased gradually with fluctuations. In this process, even though the energy input from seismic shaking at the slope base was still persistent, the energy dissipation due to bond breakage, friction and viscous damping between particles would lead to a significant reduction of the total kinetic energy (see Figure A1 in the Supplementary Information).\n\nFig. 10(b) illustrates that the fragmentation energy (Ef) evolved similarly to the pattern of slope damage index in Fig. 5(a). The cumulative energy release due to bond breakage occurred mainly between 1\u00a0s and 2\u00a0s when the ground shaking was significant. The final fragmentation energy of each test can be more than 90% of the peak slope kinetic energy. For the series of tests, the frequency of final slope fragmentation energy followed well the normal distribution pattern. The statistical values of 5th and 95th percentiles of E\n\nf\n (6.3\u271510\u22123 and 7.19\u271510\u22123, respectively) were very close to the values in simulations of 5th and 95th percentiles of final slope damage index (i.e.\u00a0=\u00a06.4\u271510\u22123 and 7.15\u271510\u22123, respectively). The slight difference was influenced by the properties of the broken bonds (e.g. location and strength).\n\n\n3.4\nSlope geometric effects\nAs discussed in Ref. 27, the mechanism of seismic amplification on slope surface could be the seismic velocity contrasts, which results in the trapping of seismic energy within the slope. This effect is largely controlled by the slope geometry and behaviour of seismic propagation, reflection and diffraction.\n53\n During earthquake, the enhanced slope deformation due to amplification has a significant impact on the slope fracturing process and associated rock strength degradation. Therefore, in this research the ground displacement amplification and slope fracturing patterns have been investigated in relation to the slope inclination angle, for the two testing conditions of fixed crest width and fixed slope volume.\nSimilarly to the simulations presented in Section 3.1, the ground amplification effect was analysed via simulations using an idealized intact slope bonded with extremely high strengths. The amplification factor was defined as the ratio of peak ground acceleration at the crest (locations L, M and R in the inset plot of Fig. 11\n) to that at the centre of slope base (location B in the inset plot of Fig. 11). In this study, the seismic amplification factors at the left (AL) and right (AR) corners, and middle (AM) of the slope crest were analysed to investigate the slope geometric effects. Fig. 11(a) illustrates that for simulations with fixed crest width, as the slope inclination angle increased, the amplification factors in the EW direction first increased and peaked at 40\u00b0. Then, the values decreased slightly and varied between 1.0 and 1.5. In the UD direction, AL and AR increased, while AM decreased gradually with the slope angle. For simulations with fixed slope volume (Fig. 11(b)), similar trends had been observed, except that the peaks in the EW direction occurred at the gentlest angle of 30\u00b0.\nThe results indicate that gentle slopes could have higher amplifications than steep slopes in the EW direction, while in the UD direction it is lower. The ground accelerations at ridge corners can be amplified significantly (e.g. AR and AM > 2.0) when compared to the middle section of the crest (AM\n\n\n\u2248\n\n 1.25). The numerical results can match well the theoretical and numerical analyses in Ref. 53 that the peak amplification occurs preferably at the crest corner and gentle slopes generally have higher amplification factors than the steeper ones. \u03a4he ground acceleration amplification and de-amplification alternated at crest surface due to the complex superposition of incident SV waves, reflected SV and P waves and diffracted Rayleigh waves. This is effectively controlled by the slope inclination angle, crest width and wavelength. A critical slope inclination angle of 32.3\u00b0 with the strongest amplification has also been obtained in Ref. 53.\nThe influence of slope geometric effect on the fracturing process was investigated via simulations using breakable rock samples (i.e. the material properties were set the same as the uniform slope sample). The slope damage index and fragment size distributions are shown in Fig. 12\n. As shown in Fig. 12(a), for both type of tests, the slope damage index (D) decreased with the inclination angle, following the exponential relationships. D initially decreased slowly for slopes flatter than 60\u00b0, while it decreased quickly for steeper slopes. The tests with fixed slope volume had slightly higher damage index than those with fixed crest width. The results indicate that the steep slopes can better resist the earthquake induced fracturing with low damages. This is due to the local topographic effect that the steep slopes have much lower ground amplifications than the gentle slopes at the ridge crests (see Fig. 11). In addition, the widespread discontinuities in gentle slopes could also in turn increase the magnitude of ground displacement amplification.\n27\n\n\nThe fragment size distributions for different simulations are illustrated in Fig. 12(b) and Figure A3, A4 (see the Supplementary Information). Though slight discrepancy existed for gentle slopes, the fragment size distributions can be best fitted by the Weibull CDF function. As the inclination angle became higher, fewer fine fragments were produced. For slopes with inclination lower than 60\u00b0, the simulations using the fixed crest width condition produced more medium sized fragments (d\u00a0=\u00a00.05\u20130.2) than those using the fixed volume condition. This is due mainly to the relatively large slope volume used in the simulations with fixed crest width (see Figure A3 in Supplementary Information). Figure A3 also shows that as the inclination angle increased, the potential slope failure type transformed gradually from the toppling of local rock fragments close to the crest to the deep-seated giant landslide.\nIn the analysis, the cumulative energy dissipation (E\n\ndiss\n) and cumulative energy input into the slope mass by seismic loading (E\n\nseismic\n) are defined as\n\n(9)\n\n\n\nE\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nE\nf\n\n\n+\n\n\nE\n\nf\nr\ni\nc\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nE\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n\nE\n\ns\ne\ni\ns\nm\ni\nc\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nE\np\n\n\n+\n\n\nE\nk\n\n\n+\n\n\u2211\n\nE\nb\n\n\n+\n\n\u2211\n\nE\nc\n\n\n+\n\n\nE\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nE\n0\n\n\n\n\nwhere E\n\n0\n is the total energy of the initial slope prior to the seismic shaking, including the slope potential energy and elastic energy stored at the inter-particle bonds and contacts. The summation is over all particle bonds and contacts.\n\nFig. 13\n illustrates the evolution of cumulative seismic input (E\n\nseismic\n) and dissipated energy (E\n\ndiss\n) of the slopes under the testing conditions of (a) fixed crest width and (b) fixed slope volume. In all tests, E\n\nseismic\n was negligibly small before t\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0s due to very small ground shaking. The energy dissipation only occurred after the initiation of bond breakage (t\u00a0=\u00a00.7\u20130.9\u00a0s), when fragmentation energy, frictional and damping dissipation energy began to increase. It is clear that the relative high value of E\n\nseismic\n at the beginning of the shaking initiated the slope damage. Then, the majority of seismic input energy transformed into the dissipated energy, as shown by the gradually converging trends for each respective test. Though slight discrepancy existed for the evolutions of these two types of energy in the middle of the simulation (t\u00a0=\u00a01\u20133\u00a0s), they were almost equal at the end of the ground shaking for any specific test. For simulations using fixed slope volume, the values of E\n\nseismic\n and E\n\ndiss\n increased quickly with the increase of slope inclination angle from 40\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, while such a relationship was not clear for simulations using fixed crest width. The increases of E\n\nseismic\n and E\n\ndiss\n were due mainly to the high seismic energy input (see Figure A5 in the Supplementary Information) and slope damage (see Fig. 12(a)).\nThe numerical results indicate that the cumulative seismic input energy into the slope would finally be dissipated through the fracturing process and fragment interactions at discontinuities. Without any energy dissipation mechanism (e.g. strong rock mass with little or no bond breakage), the slope should finally return to the original intact state after the earthquake and the cumulative seismic energy input would finally return to nil (see Figure A5). Thus, the overall bulk seismic energy input into the slope depends on the energy dissipation at discontinuities, such that the heavily fractured gentle slopes received more seismic energy than the steeper ones.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to illustrate the progressive fracturing process of heterogeneous rock slopes under transient earthquake loading by the coupled random field theory and discrete element modelling approach. Due to the high computational cost of modelling the slope topography in 3D DEM code, only the 2D DEM model was employed in this research. In addition, relatively large particles (\u223c1.9\u20132.0\u00a0m) were employed in this study so that the field scale slope was generated using a relatively small number of particles in DEM. This approach has significantly reduced the overall computational cost. The use of parallel bond model between large particles in DEM can effectively mimic the intact rock bridges and slope mass. The very narrow particle grading instead of a wide size range can reduce the material uncertainty and inhomogeneity introduced by the irregular particle packing matrix. The small polydispersity of particle grading was adopted to avoid the particle crystallization in DEM simulations. The presented results revealed that the fracturing process of a heterogeneous slope can be reproduced, at least in a reasonably qualitative way by the breakage of interparticle bonds. However, when applying such an idealized model configuration (e.g. simple geometry and loading conditions) to field studies, problems may arise as to what extent the simple 2D DEM modelling and a short-term single transient strong earthquake event are representative of real slope topography and loading conditions.\n\n4.1\nModelling timescale and boundary condition\nIn this study, the modelling timescale was set to 5-s, while in reality the earthquake shaking period was 50\u00a0s, as a compromise of computational cost in the massive DEM simulations. The simulations were run on a Desktop Workstation (i.e. Intel Xeon Processor W-2255 (10C, 3.7\u00a0GHz 4.7\u00a0GHz Turbo HT 19.25\u00a0MB 165\u00a0W DDR4-2933)). A single simulation took 2 CPU hours and the whole 5400 simulations in this research required 10800 CPU hours to complete. By using the parallel simulation technique, 10 simulations were run in parallel at the same time, and the whole simulation series took around 45 days. In the DEM simulations, since the iteration time step (5\u271510\u22124\u00a0s) was set 10 times smaller than the real seismic signal incremental (5\u271510\u22123\u00a0s), the DEM simulations were effectively speeded up by 10 times. This approach could numerically achieve the same ground displacement as the real strong earthquake within a short period of time (e.g. 5 s). In fact, the scaling of modelling time has been widely adopted in DEM to make the computational cost acceptable using the existing computing resources.\n54\n\n,\n\n55\n\n\nIn addition, during the seismic shaking, the ground acceleration can be amplified significantly at the slope surface due to wave reflection and diffraction by slope topography irregularities.\n56\n As a result, the slope crest and surface tend to be fractured thoroughly. Accurate evaluation of ground amplification effect is complicated if slope topography, soil properties, frequency and angle of incident seismic wave are considered simultaneously in the simulations. To simplify the analysis, this research only employed an idealized slope geometry and uniform particle size grading. The DEM model can effectively capture the progressive slope fracturing process under continuous ground shaking at a relatively low computational cost. It is assumed that this approach can provide useful information of seismic induced slope fracturing. During DEM simulations, a relatively high viscous damping coefficient (0.5) was employed at the slope base to reduce the ground amplification due to the reflection of long wavelength seismic waves at the rigid basal boundary. This numerical technique effectively mimics an absorbing boundary condition, in which energy of reflected waves at the base can be absorbed.\n28\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nSlope fragmentation characteristics\nThe DEM simulations in this study revealed that the rock mass can be heavily fragmented under the intense seismic loading. In this process, the internal cracks propagated and nucleated within the slope, interrupting the transmission of stress waves and leading to significant energy dissipation at the discontinuities. The resulting fragment size decreased with the height within the slope and the fine fragments concentrated mainly at the slope crest, as illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7 and Figure A3 (in the Supplementary Information). In general, near the slope surface, intense superposition of incident SV waves, reflected SV and P waves, and Rayleigh waves exists, which increases the amplitude of resultant waves as the energy piles up. As reported in Ref. 57, the generated Rayleigh wave at the crest can have the amplitudes 0.4 times as much as the incident waves. The slope topography can further increase the amplification effect.\n56\n Depending on the location and material properties (e.g. rock strength) at different locations of a heterogeneous slope, the ground amplification intensity varies widely, facilitating the occurrence of differential ground displacement. In addition, the fracturing probability of a rock mass is primarily controlled by its tensile strength.\n28\n Thus, the relatively low strengths and high ground amplifications at the slope crest and surface could the dominant factors controlling the fragment sizes.\nThe slope topography can have a significant influence on the fragmentation process, due primarily to ground amplification effects. The gentler slopes generally have higher amplification than the steeper ones, such that the slope were more intensely fragmented with a large number of fine fragments at the crest and slope surface along the height of the slope (see Figure A3 in the Supplementary Information). When compared to the steeper ones, the gentler slopes have much longer inclined slope lengths at low reliefs and the UD seismic wave only needs to travel shorter distances to reach the slope surfaces with less energy loss. The reflected P waves can directly reach the upper surface and superimpose with the SV and Rayleigh waves. Correspondingly, a large portion of seismic energy can reach the slope surface and be amplified due to wave superposition. This process can lead to both higher amplitudes and longer duration of shaking. Therefore, seismic wave of high energy together with the differential ground displacement can heavily damage the upper sector of the slope. For steeper slopes, this effect is significantly weakened as the reflected P waves transform into surface waves and their amplitudes quickly reduce to zero.\n53\n As a result, the steep slopes have much lower fragmentation intensity and only several major interconnected cracks existed within the slope. These fracturing patterns could control subsequent slope failure\/landslide dynamics, such that small scale landslide can occur in gentle slopes, while deep-seated giant landslides can happen in steep slopes.\n\n\n4.3\nMultiple earthquake impacts\nThe current study only focused on the impact of a single transient strong earthquake on slope fracturing, while in nature, earthquakes of various magnitudes may happen periodically in a specific region. These repeated earthquakes with strong cyclic loading and unloading effects can induce significant incremental internal damage of rock slope overtime. As stated in Ref. 23, the seismic-induced slope fracturing process can selectively open existing joints and reduce the normal stiffness of rock fragments, which results in strong spectral amplification when subsequent earthquakes occur. This process can also lead to intense stress variations within the rock mass and between the pre-existing fracture networks. These compliant fractures would finally bring the rock slope to a highly critical state, at which an even small disturbance, e.g. low-magnitude earthquake or rainfall, combined with the localized ground amplification and site effects, may lead to the ultimate catastrophic failure of the slope.\n15\n\n,\n\n58\n\n,\n\n59\n This effect is particularly significant for deep-seated landslides as characterized by the long-term and time-dependent creeping movement, but short periods of rapid accelerations at failure. The failure surface normally consists of pre-existing shear planes and newly formed fractures. A good example can be the large number of slope failures occurred in the Wenchuan seismic zone resulting from the long-term active tectonic activities and repeated earthquakes. These historical seismic events could be the destabilization mechanisms contributing to the impending slope failures or the preparatory ones for a triggering rainfall event.\nAs the primary objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of slope fracturing with heterogeneous initial material properties, only a single transient earthquake event was analysed. However, the DEM modelling presented has already shown the capability to qualitatively capture the characteristic of progressive slope fracturing, including evolution of fracture network, damage index and slope fragmentation energy, the distributions of fragment sizes and ground amplification effect. The current study can be further extended to the study of multiple earthquake impacts, with explicit consideration of material heterogeneity and with different magnitudes.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe earthquake induced slope fracturing process was investigated by a novel probabilistic modelling approach combining the random field theory and discrete element method. This approach enables the heterogeneity of slope material strength to be explicitly quantified by the random field theory in a standard normal distribution. The simplified 2D model configuration can effectively analyse the feedbacks between progressive slope fracturing and seismic site effects. The slope fracturing occurred naturally when the imposed seismic loads exceeded the bonding strength of particles in DEM modelling. The statistical results of rock fragment size, damage index and slope energy components can provide useful information for slope designs and rockfall hazard evaluations. The major findings are summarized as follows:\n\n1)\nThe ground amplification was significant at the slope crest and ground surface, with the cumulative displacement up to 8 times the base shaking displacement. Differential ground displacements at the same slope height existed widely within the slope, which is the triggering factor of slope fracturing.\n\n\n2)\nAs the ground acceleration increased, the small fractures first occurred at the slope surface near the crest region, quickly propagating and nucleating within the slope to form interconnected larger fractures. The major slope damages occurred within a short period of time (1\u00a0s) when the large ground displacements dominated (\u22480.2\u00a0m). Depending on the initial random fields of rock strength, these fractures concentrated primarily at the upper sector of the slope, while the bottom region of the slope remained intact.\n\n\n3)\nThe size of the generated rock fragments followed well the Weibull's cumulative distribution. It decreased with the height within the slope. The slope fragmentation energy has been introduced to quantify the energy release during the fracturing process. For the series of tests, the slope fragmentation energy followed the normal distribution.\n\n\n4)\nThe slope inclination angle could influence the fracturing process significantly. Both the ground amplification and slope damage index decreased with the increase of inclination. The cumulative seismic energy input into the slope increased with the increase of slope inclination and would finally be dissipated through the fracturing process and fragment interactions at discontinuities.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclarations\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

The hydraulic fractures that emanate from the cased and cemented well may be tortuous, especially when the perforation orientation is not aligned with the preferred fracture direction (i.e., the direction of the maximum in-situ principal stress). The near-wellbore fracture significantly affects the fluid flow, proppant transportation and well productivity.\n9\u201312\n Therefore, it is crucial to clearly understand the near-wellbore fracturing of rock as it is affected by various underlying factors.\nFor an open hole well completion, hydraulic fractures are initiated when the hoop tensile stress around the wellbore exceeds the tensile strength of the rock and propagate along the maximum principal stress direction. In this case, the fracture initiation pressure can be determined by the in-situ stress, rock strength and pore pressure, which has also been widely used for the in-situ stress measurement in hydraulic fracturing.\n13\n Further, Hossain et al.\n14\n developed an analytical model to determine the fracture initiation pressure for an open wellbore with perforation and found that the perforation invariably reduced the fracture initiation pressure when the perforations were oriented along the preferred fracture direction; however, when the perforation were created and deviated away from the preferred direction, a higher breakdown pressure was needed.\nOpen hole well completion has considerable limitation in conducting stimulation especially in medium- and low-permeability reservoirs. Casing perforation completion has therefore been widely adopted to help with various downhole operations especially where borehole stability is an issue. For a cased and cemented well, the combined casing-cement-rock structure will influence and, in some sense, control the pressure acting on the rock. Yew et al.\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n derived an analytical solution to determine fracture initiation pressure for a cased well and found that the steel casing had a dominant effect on the stress distribution around the wellbore and that the hoop stress of rock for a cased well is larger than that for an open hole. Zhu et al.\n6\n developed an analytical model to predict the fracture initiation pressure for a cased well with perforation and postulated that the fracture initiation pressure is more accurate when considering the casing structure. Dong et al.\n17\n proposed a theoretical model based on Mode I and Model II Stress Intensity Factors (SIF) to determine the critical water pressure and the critical initiation angle for hydraulic fracturing through a single radial perforation emanating from a borehole and found the fracture initiation angle decreased with the increase of the water injection pressure. However, the existing models\n6\n\n,\n\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n assumed that the elastic modulus of cement was the same as that of rock and the effect of the cement sheath on fracturing was not considered. Moreover, the fracture tortuosity and propagation pressure for the cased and cemented well with perforations are extremely hard to determine by analytical methods.\nIn the past few decades, the near-wellbore rock fracturing problem has been investigated by a number of researchers, particularly with numerical methods.\n9\n\n,\n\n10\n\n,\n\n18\u201320\n Zhang et al.\n10\n developed a coupled numerical model for rock deformation and fluid flow to simulate near-wellbore hydraulic fracturing and found that using more viscous fluid and higher injection rates can reduce near-wellbore fracture tortuosity. He et al.\n20\n employed the discrete finite element method (Universal Distinct Element Code) to simulate the hydraulic fracture re-orientation around the wellbore with a perforation or flaw. They found that hydraulic fracture tended to be oriented by perforations in relatively heterogeneous rocks. Cherny et al.\n18\n developed a finite element method to model the near-wellbore fracture propagation by predetermining a curving fracture following an arc with a given radius. Xiang et al.\n21\n simulated fracture initiation from a wellbore and propagation in a rock formation with pre-existing fractures by inserting cohesive elements into the edges of bulk elements. Dong and Tang\n11\n first proposed a SIF-based incremental crack growth method to model the near-wellbore hydraulic fracture propagation and comprehensively discussed the effects of perforations angles, lengths and stress ratios on the fracture trajectory. They found that the perforation angle was the most important controlling factor in complicating the hydraulic fracture propagation path near-the wellbore.\n11\n However, modelling the arbitrary cracking of rock is quite cumbersome or time-consuming for continuously remeshing around the new crack tip or embedding interface elements into the edges of the solid elements.\nThe extended finite element method (XFEM) can provide an effective tool in solving the technical issues associated with modelling arbitrary cracking and hence is ideal in simulating the near-well rock fracture tortuosity. Li et al.\n22\n simulated the re-orientation of hydraulic fractures using XFEM and found a larger perforation angle (angle between the perforation and the in-situ maximum principal stress) resulted in a more curving fracture path. Feng and Gray\n9\n\n,\n\n19\n modelled the fracture propagation from the wellbore in XFEM and discussed the effects of multiple perforation designs on the fracturing process. Further, considering rock as permeable medium with Mohr-Coulomb plasticity, Wang\n23\n developed a fully coupled XFEM model to simulate non-planar hydraulic fracture propagation. However, in almost all the existing models for near-wellbore hydraulic fracturing, the pressure acting on the rock surface of the wellbore (the actual pressure transmitted to the formation) was assumed to be the same as the casing fluid pressure. This is an unrealistic hypothesis as it ignores the deformation and load-transferring capacity of the composite well system. To date, there is no model which accounts for the realistic pressure on the wellbore surface and which can therefore reliably simulate the near-wellbore rock fracture propagation, for cased and perforated wells. This poses challenges in accurately modelling the near-wellbore fracture tortuosity in rock and optimization of the perforated completion.\nThis paper develops a combined analytical-numerical method to simulate the near-wellbore rock fracture initiation and propagation for a cased and cemented well with perforations. An analytical model is first derived for calculating the pressure acting on the rock surface with the consideration of stress transmission through the casing-cement-rock structure. The effects of geometries (i.e., thicknesses of casing and cement sheath) and mechanical properties (i.e., Young's modulus of casing and cement) on the pressure transmission are explored through the analytical model. Based on the XFEM framework and cohesive crack model, the near-wellbore fracture of rock is simulated and analysed. The pressure applied on the wellbore rock surface is correlated with the casing injection pressure by the developed analytical transmission equation through an in-house ABAQUS subroutine written in FORTRAN. A worked example is then presented to demonstrate the application of the combined analytical-numerical method. Model verification is also conducted by comparing the results with those from experiments. Furthermore, a deflection angle is defined to quantitatively describe the near-wellbore fracture tortuosity. A parametric study is carried out to discuss the effects of some underlying parameters, e.g., pressure transmission coefficient, perforation angle, in-situ stress field, and perforation depth, on the development of injection pressure, fracture trajectory and deflection angle.\n\n\n2\nAnalytical formulation for the pressure transmission through the casing-cementing-rock system\n\n2.1\nModel description\n\nFig. 1\n illustrates a vertical well system with steel casing, cement sheath, rock formation and perforations. In the cased, cemented and perforated well, fluid injected into the casing produces pressure and fractures the rock. Due to the uniform strain along the well axial direction, the deformation of the casing-cement-rock structure can be regarded as a plane strain problem.\n6\n\n,\n\n24\n\n,\n\n25\n The radial fluid pressure on the inner surface of the casing first deforms the casing and is then transmitted to the cement and rock. The realistic pressure to fracture the rock is therefore not the hydraulic pressure acting on the steel casing, but the pressure transferred through the well system to the rock. Previous studies have only considered the effect of steel casing on the fracture initiation of rock with the assumption that the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is the same as that of the rock\n6\n\n,\n\n25\n which can lead to inaccurate calculation of the driving force to fracture the rock. In this study, we consider the three-layer structure of well, consisting of casing, cement sheath and rock, and determine the pressure acting on the cement-rock interface which will be used for modelling the near-wellbore fracture of rock.\nThe following assumptions are made for the analytical model: (1) the interfaces between casing, cement and rock are perfectly bound together; (2) the steel casing and cement are considered as elastic materials; (3) the near-well cracking of rock will not affect the radial direction elastic modulus of the rock formation, so the rock can still be considered as deforming elastically when determining the pressure transmission and; (4) only the fluid pressure-induced stress in the casing-cement-well system is formulated in the analytical model while the stress induced by the in-situ stress and the hole will be considered and superimposed in the numerical model. Similar assumptions have been made and generally accepted for modelling the effect of casing on hydraulic fracturing.\n6\n\n,\n\n24\n\n,\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nAnalytical formulation of the stress transmission through the well system\nAccording to Timoshenko's theory of Elasticity,\n26\n a thick-wall cylinder under internal pressure P\n\ni\n and external pressure P\n\ne\n can be formulated as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nr\n\n=\n\n\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nP\ne\n\n\u2212\n\nP\ni\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\nr\n2\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nP\ni\n\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nP\ne\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nP\ne\n\n\u2212\n\nP\ni\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\nr\n2\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nP\ni\n\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nP\ne\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nu\n=\n\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n)\n\n\n(\n\nP\ni\n\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nP\ne\n\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n)\n\n\n\nE\n\n(\n\nR\ne\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nR\ni\n2\n\n)\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c3\nr\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\u03b8\n\n\n are the radial and hoop stresses in the cylinder, respectively; \n\nu\n\n is the radial displacement at a radius of r in the cylinder; R\ni and R\n\ne\n are the internal and external radius of the cylinder and; E and \u03bd are Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the material, respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the casing-cement-rock structure is considered as three co-axial cylinders.

pressure transmission coefficient.\n\n\n\n3\nHydro-fracture numerical method\n\n3.1\nRock deformation\nFor simplicity, we assume the rock model as a two-dimensional, isotropic, and homogeneous formation fully saturated with a single-phase fluid. According to Hooke\u2019 law, the linear elastic behaviour for rock before crack initiation is expressed as follows:\n\n(12)\n\n\n\u03c3\n=\n\nD\nel\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03c3\n\n is the total stress tensor; \n\n\nD\nel\n\n\n is the fourth-order elasticity tensor; \n\n\u03b5\n\n is the elastic strain.\nFor coupled pore fluid and stress problem in the saturated porous medium, the total stress should be replaced by the effective stress which is expressed as follows\n27\n:\n\n(13)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n=\n\u03c3\n+\n\u03b1\np\nI\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n\n are the effective stress tensor and total stress tensor, respectively;\n\n\nI\n\n is the unit tensor; \n\np\n\n is the pore pressure value; \n\n\u03b1\n\n is the Biot's coefficient. It should be mentioned that, it is difficult to determine Biot's coefficient which may also vary non-linearly with the pressure. Therefore, Biot's coefficient is simplified as a constant value 1 for calculating the effective stress in this study, which is a widely-acceptable solution for hydraulic fracturing modelling.\n19\n\n,\n\n21\n\n,\n\n28\u201330\n\n\nFurther, the discretized equilibrium in a porous medium can be described by the principle of virtual work as follows\n31\n:\n\n(14)\n\n\n\n\n\u222b\nV\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\n:\n\u03b4\n\u03b5\n\nd\nV\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u222b\nS\n\n\nt\n:\n\u03b4\nv\n\nd\nS\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u222b\nV\n\n\n\nf\n\u02c6\n\n:\n\u03b4\nv\n\nd\nV\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03b4\nv\n\n is a virtual velocity field; \n\n\u03b4\n\u03b5\n\n is virtual rate of deformation; \n\nt\n\n represents the surface tractions per unit area; \n\n\nf\n\u02c6\n\n\n represents the body forces per unit volume; V is the volume.\n\n\n3.2\nXFEM framework and cohesive crack model\nBelytschko and Black\n32\n first introduced the extended finite element method (XFEM) to overcome the problem associated with matching the geometry of the discontinuity during crack propagation. The presence of discontinuities is ensured by the enriched functions in conjunction with additional degrees of freedom while the continuous displacements are derived from the conventional FEM with the retained sparsity and symmetry. By using the XFEM technique, the remeshing is not required for modelling arbitrary cracking.\n\nFig. 2\n illustrates the principle for describing the displacement field for a finite element model with an arbitrary crack. For the purpose of fracture analysis, a conventional shape function for the continuous part of the finite element solution, a discontinuous function for the jump in displacement across the crack surfaces, and a crack tip asymptotic functions capturing the singularity around the crack tip are combined as an enriched function for describing the total displacement. The enriched displacement function is expressed as follows\n33\n:\n\n(15)\n\n\nu\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nI\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\n\nN\nI\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n\n[\n\nu\nI\n\nc\no\nn\n\n\n+\nH\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\na\nI\n\n+\n\n\u2211\n\n\u03b1\n=\n1\n\n4\n\n\nF\n\u03b1\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\nb\nI\n\u03b1\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nwhere u is the displacement in the computational domain; N is the number of the Gauss integral points in the domain; N\n\nI\n\n(x) is the continuous nodal shape functions; \n\n\nu\nI\n\nc\no\nn\n\n\n\n is the continuous nodal displacement for the traditional finite element solution; \n\nH\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n is the Heaviside function for achieving the displacement jump across the crack surface; \n\n\na\nI\n\n\n is the nodal enriched degree of freedom; \n\n\nF\n\u03b1\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n is the asymptotic crack tip function and; \n\n\nb\nI\n\u03b1\n\n\n is the nodal enriched degree of freedom.\nThrough locally enriching the finite-element model in the vicinity of the fracture, XFEM does not alleviate the requirement for continuously updating the mesh to conform to the geometry of the discontinuity as the crack progresses. The crack feature is constructed in terms of nodal values at the nodes of the original mesh. Therefore, XFEM can well simulate the arbitrary cracking through simplification in the modelling of discontinuous phenomena. More details on the XFEM theory can be found in Refs. 19,31,32,34.\nRock is a typical quasi-brittle material which exhibits strain softening behaviour after the peak stress due to an inelastic zone being developed ahead of the crack tip.\n35\n\n,\n\n36\n This inelastic softening zone is often referred to as fracture process zone (FPZ). To simulate the fracture propagation in rock, the inelastic behaviour within the FPZ should be taken in to account. Hillerborg et al.\n37\n first proposed the concept of cohesive model to simulate discrete cracking within the fracture process zone; since then, the cohesive crack model has been widely employed and further developed to model the materials which display strain softening behavior.\n19\n\n,\n\n38\u201343\n In the XFEM framework, the cohesive crack model is embedded into the enriched element to simulate the crack initiation and propagation.\nAs shown in Fig. 3\n, an extrinsic traction-separation law is used to constitutively control the tensile stress-displacement relationship of the crack. The stress of cohesive elements is a function of the corresponding relative displacement of the crack surface. In general, the stress\u2013displacement relationship for the cracks can be expressed as follows:\n\n(16)\n\n\n\u03c3\n=\nf\n\n(\n\u03b4\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03c3\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n are the cohesive stress and crack opening displacement, respectively; \n\nf\n\n is a linear or non-linear function defining the relationship between the stress and displacement.\nBefore crack initiation, the material response follows a linearly elastic behaviour, determined by the elastic stiffness of the materials. The maximum principal stress criterion is used to determine the damage initiation, i.e., once the maximum principal stress reaches the tensile strength of rock, the damage initiation of the enriched element will occur. Accordingly, the damage initiation criterion can be expressed as follows:\n\n(17)\n\n\n<\n\n\u03c3\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n>\n=\n\nf\nt\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n is the maximum principal stress, \n\n\nf\nt\n\n\n is the tensile strength, \n\n<\n\n>\n\n is the Macaulay Bracket to ensure the compressive stress state does not initiate damage.\nThe newly introduced crack direction is orthogonal to the maximum principal stress direction when the damage initiation criterion is satisfied. To improve the accuracy of the computed propagation direction, the stress field ahead of the crack tip is evaluated by a nonlocal averaging method. The nonlocal averaging zone is the elements ahead of the crack tip with a radius of three times the typical element characteristic length in the enriched region.\nAfter damage initiation, the cohesive strength gradually decreases by following certain softening rules. For example, the softening behaviour can be in a linear, bilinear or exponential curve. The area underneath the softening curve is typically known as the fracture energy G\n\nf\n which is also specific fracture energy, or critical energy release rate.\n35\n\n,\n\n44\n It should be mentioned that the fracture energy for quasi-brittle materials including rock and concrete can be directly measured by standard experiments\n45\n (e.g., the three-points beam bending test,\n46\n close-loop direct tensile test\n44\n and compact tensile test\n47\n). The damage evolution is defined as follows\n48\n:\n\n(18)\n\n\nD\n=\n\n\n\n\u03b4\nf\n\n\n(\n\n\u03b4\nm\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4\n0\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\nm\n\n\n(\n\n\u03b4\nf\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4\n0\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03b4\n0\n\n\n is the critical displacement when the stress reaches the peak value (i.e., D\u00a0=\u00a00); \n\n\n\u03b4\nm\n\n\n is the maximum displacement during the loading history; \n\n\n\u03b4\nf\n\n\n is the failure displacement when the stress reduces to zero (i.e., D\u00a0=\u00a01). By assuming linear softening, \n\n\n\u03b4\n0\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b4\nf\n\n\n can be determined by the material properties as follows:\n\n(19)\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n0\n\n=\n\n\nf\nt\n\nE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(20)\n\n\n\n\u03b4\nf\n\n=\n\n\n2\n\nG\nf\n\n\n\nf\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, the residual stress of the damaged enriched elements can be obtained according to the damage factor \n\nD\n\n as follows:\n\n(21)\n\n\n\u03c3\n=\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\nD\n\n)\n\nE\n\u03b4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nFluid flow model\nPrior to crack initiation the intact rock is assumed to be an elastic porous medium, fully saturated with a single-phase fluid. The fluid flux in the porous rock matrix is described by Darcy's law\n30\n:\n\n(22)\n\n\nq\n=\n\u2212\n\nk\n\u03bc\n\n\u2207\np\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nq\n\n is the fluid volumetric flux in unit m\/s; k is the permeability coefficient in unit m2; \n\n\u03bc\n\n is the fluid viscosity in Pa\u2022s; \n\n\u2207\np\n\n is the fluid pressure gradient in Pa\/m.\nA continuity equation is required for pore fluid flow in the porous medium, i.e., the rate of increase in liquid mass stored at a point equals the rate of mass of liquid flowing into the point within the time increment. The continuity equation can be expressed as follows\n49\n:\n\n(23)\n\n\n\n1\nJ\n\n\nd\n\nd\nt\n\n\n\n(\n\nJ\n\n\u03c1\nw\n\nn\n\n)\n\n+\n\n\u2202\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c1\nw\n\nq\n)\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nJ\n\n is the volume change ratio of porous medium; t is the time; \n\n\n\u03c1\nw\n\n\n is the mass density of the fluid; \n\nn\n\n is the porosity, i.e., the ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume;\nOnce crack initiation occurs, additional phantom nodes with pore pressure degrees of freedom are activated to model the fluid flow within the cracked element surfaces. As shown in Fig. 4\n, this enriched element with pore pressure cohesive model enables fluid pressure implementation in the cracked element, to facilitate modelling of the hydraulic flow-driven fracture process. The tangential flow within the cracked surface is expressed as a Newtonian fluid following the Poiseulle's law. The relationship between the pressure gradient and fluid flux is formulated as follows\n19\n:\n\n(24)\n\n\nq\n=\n\u2212\n\n\nd\n3\n\n\n12\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u2207\np\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nq\n\n is the fluid flux of the tangential flow; \n\n\u2207\np\n\n is the fluid pressure gradient along the cohesive zone. d is the crack opening displacement.\nThe normal flow is described by defining a fluid leak-off coefficient for the cracked element surface, presented as follows:\n\n(25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq\nt\n\n=\n\nc\nt\n\n\n(\n\np\nf\n\n\u2212\n\np\nt\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq\nb\n\n=\n\nc\nb\n\n\n(\n\np\nf\n\n\u2212\n\np\nb\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nq\nt\n\n\n and \n\n\nq\nb\n\n\n are the flow rates into the top and bottom of the cracked surface, respectively; \n\n\nc\nt\n\n\n and \n\n\nc\nb\n\n\n are the corresponding leak-off coefficients, with the unit m\/(Pa\u00b7s), for the top and bottom surface of the crack, respectively. \n\n\np\nf\n\n\n is the fluid pressure at the middle of the crack gap. \n\n\np\nt\n\n\n and \n\n\np\nb\n\n\n are the pore pressures on the top and bottom surfaces of the crack, respectively.\nFor incompressible fluid, the continuity equation of mass conservation in the fracture is expressed as follows\n22\n\n,\n\n50\n:\n\n(26)\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nd\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n+\n\nq\nt\n\n+\n\nq\nb\n\n=\n\u2207\n\u22c5\n\n(\n\n\n\nd\n3\n\n\n12\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u2207\np\n\n)\n\n+\nQ\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\u03b4\n\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nQ\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n is the flow rate at time t. \n\n\u03b4\n\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\n is the Dirac function which equals to zero everywhere except for the flow injection point.\nThe fluid pressure acts as a traction on the surfaces of the crack and drives the opening of the fracture following the cohesive law. The general stress field of the cohesive zones is balanced with the fluid pressure of the cohesive zones. Thus, a coupled fluid pressure-traction-separation relationship exists between the cohesive zone defined by the stress-displacement law and the lubrication model.\n50\n\n,\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nWorked example and verification\nWe first discuss the effect of well system design on the pressure transmission to the rock. The key design parameters for casing and cement to ensure the well integrity include geometric size (i.e., the thickness of casing and cement sheath) and the mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus of steel casing and cement).\n7\n By using Equations (10) and (11), the effects of these key design parameters of casing and cement on the pressure transmission coefficient to the rock can be assessed. Typical values for these parameters are listed in Table 1\n. Fig. 5\n illustrates the effect of thickness of casing and cement on the pressure transmission coefficient. It can be seen that the value for the pressure transmission coefficient K decreases from 0.71 to 0.12 when the casing thickness and cement sheath thickness change from 5 to 55\u00a0mm, respectively. In general, the thicker the casing or cement sheath is, the less pressure is transferred to the rock. In particular, the thinner either the casing or the cement sheath, the variation of K caused by the change of the other thickness parameters is larger. For example, when the casing thickness is 30\u00a0mm, K varies from 0.08 to 0.19 with cement sheath thickness of 30\u00a0mm\u201310\u00a0mm. While for casing thickness of 10\u00a0mm, K varies from 0.27 to 0.49 with cement sheath thickness from 30\u00a0mm to 10\u00a0mm. Fig. 6\n shows the effect of Young's modulus of casing and cement on the pressure transmission coefficient. It is interesting that the larger Young's modulus of the casing, the smaller the pressure transmission coefficient. In contrast, with increasing Young's modulus of cement, the pressure transmission coefficient sharply increases first but keeps almost constant after around 20\u00a0GPa. Young's modulus for widely used Class G cement normally varies from 2 to 30\u00a0GPa which is related to water\/cement ratio, curing time and construction quality, etc.\n52\n A lower Young's modulus of cement can reduce the pressure transmitted onto the rock formation. Therefore, the casing and cement sheath have significant effects on the pressure transmission and the cement sheath should be considered in any model to determine the rock fracture initiation or propagation.\nAs a demonstration of the developed method in solving near-well fracture of rock, a plane strain worked example for a cased and cemented well with a single perforation is presented. The model is a two-dimensional plane strain cylinder with an external radius of 1.5\u00a0m which is large enough for modelling the near-wellbore fracture problem. The angle between the maximum principal stress and perforation is 60\u00b0. Fig. 7\n shows the mesh of the worked example. To reduce the degrees of freedom for the numerical model and improve the accuracy, the area of interest for potential cracking is meshed with refined elements. There are 77,540 quadratic elements in the whole model with a minimum size of 1\u00a0mm which is much smaller than the length of fracture process zone. It should be mentioned that, the realistic perforations are three-dimensional circular holes. This 2D model is just capable to simulate the initiation and propagation of perforated fracture plane outwards the well.\n10\n\n,\n\n19\n A 3D fracture modelling based on cohesive crack model is very challenging due to element size requirements, i.e., the element size should be much smaller than the length of fracture process zone. The effects of the 3D perforation slots on the rock cracking are not considered in this model.\nThe simulation steps used in this study are as follows: first, the geostatic equilibrium status is established after the in-situ stresses and initial pore pressure are applied to the model; second, the elements within the wellbore zone are removed to simulate the wellbore extraction; finally, fluid is injected into the perforation by a concentrated flow at the phantom node of the enriched element nearest the wellbore surface. During the fluid injection process, the pore pressure at the injecting point can be regarded as the fluid pressure in the well. This fluid pressure, varying with the rock fracture, is monitored by a sensor subroutine in ABAQUS solver. The varying pressure is updated and applied on to the rock surface by multiplying the pressure transmission coefficient K with the injection pressure. The coupling process of fluid injection and injection-induced pressure acting on the rock surface is achieved by an in-house ABAQUS subroutine written in FORTRAN. The values and their resources for the basic geometric and mechanical parameters in the worked example are listed in Table 2\n. The determined pressure transmission coefficient through Equation (11) is 0.5 in the worked example.\n\nFig. 8\n illustrates the development of injection pressure as a function of injection time. It can be seen that the injection pressure rapidly increases up to the critical pressure (about 58\u00a0MPa) when the rock fracture begins to propagate. Pressure then gradually drops as the fracture propagates, flattening when the fracture propagates to about 0.2\u00a0m long (i.e., point B in Fig. 8). After 1.7\u00a0s of injection, the fracture length reaches 0.75\u00a0m which is about 10 times the well radius. Fig. 9\n shows the pore pressure distributions at the injection time points 0.0016\u00a0s, 0.18\u00a0s, 0.59\u00a0s and 1.43\u00a0s, respectively. The injection pressures for these four time points are referred to as points A, B, C, D, respectively, in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the rock fracture initiates at the end of the perforation and propagates within the enriched elements. The pore pressure in the cracked elements for the perforation is larger due to higher permeability. With the injection time increasing, the fracture propagates towards the maximum principal stress direction. A fluid lag zone is seen ahead of the crack tip where the pore pressure is very small. In this fluid lag zone the mesh is open but not pressurised by the fluid: this is an important feature of viscous fluid-driven fracture growth.\n10\n With the fracture propagation, the pore pressure beyond the sides of crack is also increased due to fluid leak-off.\n\nFig. 10\n shows the near-well fracture trajectory and width at the final injection time 1.7\u00a0s. It can be seen that the fracture propagates towards the maximum principal stress direction (x direction) at about 0.85\u00a0m and 10 times the well radius. The fracture deflection is induced by the in-situ stress difference. The curved fracture can well represent the fracture complexity near the perforated well.\n9\n . Moreover, the fracture width at the middle of the fracture is larger while the widths near the perforation and the crack tip are smaller. The restriction of the opening of fracture near the perforation could provide a benefit in plugging lost circulation fractures in wellbore strengthening operations, but would also pose difficulties for proppant placement due to bridging.\nTo quantitatively describe the deflection of the near-well rock fracture, we define a deflection angle for the near-well fracture tortuosity, as shown in Fig. 11\n. The point on the fracture propagated to a length of wellbore diameter (i.e., line AB\u00a0=\u00a02R) along the direction of maximum in-situ principal stress is chosen to determine the deflection angle. The ratio of the crack length along the \n\n\n\u03c3\nH\n\n\n direction to that along the \n\n\n\u03c3\nh\n\n\n direction (h\/2R) can be calculated. The deflection angle is defined as the inclination from the perforation direction and hence can be obtained as follows:\n\n(27)\n\n\n\u03c6\n=\n\u03b8\n+\n\ntan\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n(\n\nh\n\n2\nR\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere h is positive if the inclination falls below the horizontal reference line (i.e., Point C is below Point B) while h is negative if the inclination stays above the horizontal reference line (i.e., Point C is above Point B).\nAccording the above definition, a larger deflection angle represents a sharper turning of the fracture away from the perforation direction. Moreover, a larger deflection angle of the near-wellbore fracture can limit the proppant placement and transportation near the wellbore due to the restricted crack width. But a larger deflection angle can also facilitate the fracture bridging, which is a desirable phenomenon for wellbore strengthening treatment.\n19\n The calculated deflection angle for the worked example is 70.6\u00b0. The deflection angle will later be used to assess the near-wellbore rock fracture tortuosity.\nTo verify the proposed numerical model, the results are compared with experimental data from the literature.\n12\n Abass et al. conducted hydraulic fracturing tests on cuboid blocks of hydrostone (i.e., cement mortar) with perforations and obtained fractures with a curved trajectory.\n12\n We establish a 2D plane-strain model with a perforation angle 75\u00b0 with the dimensions of 152.4 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0152.4\u00a0mm to verify the developed numerical method. There are 18,496 quadratic elements in the whole model and the mesh is refined around the wellbore. The wellbore has a radius of 9.5\u00a0mm and the depth of perforation is 12.7\u00a0mm. The inner and outer radius of the steel casing are 7.75\u00a0mm and 9.5\u00a0mm, respectively. According to the experimental design,\n12\n the basic parameters for the numerical model are listed in Table 3\n. The determined pressure transmission coefficient is 0.2. The flow rate (m2\/s) in the 2D numerical model is calculated by the experimental flow rate (m3\/s) dividing by the length of perforations. Fig. 12\n shows the mesh grid for verification and the comparisons of fracture trajectory predicted by our numerical approach and the experimental results of Abass et al.\n12\n The numerical results for the fracture trajectory are in very good agreement with most of the points obtained from the experimental results, which validates the capability of the developed numerical method. The differences of the deviation the experimental and numerical results on the crack away from the injection hole can be attributed to: (1) the numerical model is simplified from the physical experiments and some experimental conditions are not considered in the numerical model, e.g., friction effects between the loading plates and the specimen surfaces. (2) the numerical model is assumed as homogeneous while the heterogeneity of specimens might cause some differences.\n\n\n5\nParametric study and discussion\nSince the pressure transmission coefficient varies with the casing-cement-rock structure and is often overlooked in modelling, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the pressure transmission coefficient on the injection pressure and fracture trajectory. Fig. 13\n illustrates that the development of wellbore pressure under different values of K, i.e., K\u00a0=\u00a00.3 to 0.7. The other parameters in the numerical models have been kept the same as those used in the worked example. It is clear that the stress transmission through the well system to the rock significantly affects the pressure development, especially in the early stage of fracture propagation. When K increases from 0.3 to 0.7, the critical\/breakdown pressure is increased by 6.8% from 56.8\u00a0MPa to 63.5\u00a0MPa. However, as the injection time increases and the fracture propagates, the differences of the injection fluid pressure under different K values become smaller.\n\nFig. 14\n(a) shows the near-well rock fracture trajectories for the different values of pressure transmission coefficient. A smaller K value leads to a sharper inclination of the crack. In other words, a larger pressure transferred onto the rock surface tends to drive the rock fracture along the perforation direction. Fig. 14(b) illustrates the changes of the deflection angle \u03c6 under different values of K. The deflection angle has a roughly linear relation to K. When K is increased from 0.3 to 0.7, the turning angle is decreased by 11.2\u00b0 from 76.1\u00b0 to 65.8\u00b0.\nFor a given perforation angle, a sharper deflection of the near-well rock fracture makes the fracture propagate to the maximum principal stress direction over a shorter distance, which reduces the breakdown pressure as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, a larger pressure transmission coefficient will make the near-wellbore fracture closer to the perforation direction but relatively further from the maximum principal stress direction, if they are different. Changing the design of casing and cement sheath will therefore affect the fracking pressure and the fracture tortuosity. If near-wellbore rock fracture tortuosity is desired, Young's modulus of cement can be tuned to reduce the pressure transmitted to the wellbore surface. However, to obtain a smooth fracture for proppant placement and transportation, the thickness of the casing and cement sheath can be reasonably reduced to increase the pressure transmitted on to the wellbore surface. Overall, the well design and selection of casing and cementing material parameters should be considered to best predict the near-wellbore fracture tortuosity.\nThe angle between the perforation and direction of maximum principal stress is a key parameter for perforation design. Fig. 15\n illustrates the injection pressure development for the perforation angles 0\u201390\u00b0. Due to the symmetricity, it is numerically difficult to simulate the case for the perforation angle 90\u00b0; a perforation angle of 89\u00b0 is used instead. It can be seen that a larger perforation angle incurs a bigger critical\/breakdown pressure. For example, the breakdown pressure for the perforation angle 89\u00b0 (for 90\u00b0) is 66.8\u00a0MPa which is 37% higher than that for the perforation angle 0\u00b0. Moreover, the steady pressure for the fracture propagation is smaller when the perforation angle is smaller. Therefore, to reduce the injection pressure for hydraulic fracturing, the preferred perforation should be ideally along the direction of the maximum principal stress (i.e., \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0). Fig. 16\n shows the fracture trajectories for different perforation angles. It can be seen that, first, the fractures are reoriented towards the direction of the maximum principal stress, as expected; second, the deflection angle of the fracture increases as the perforation angle is increased. However, the change of the deflection angle becomes steady for larger values of the perforation angle. Therefore, if the preferred angle of 0\u00b0 for the perforation construction cannot be precisely achieved in practice due to unknown in-situ stress condition, the perforation angle should preferably be kept between 0 and 30\u00b0 to reduce the near-wellbore rock fracture complexity.\n\nFig. 17\n illustrates the effect of stress ratio (\n\n\n\u03c3\nH\n\n\/\n\n\u03c3\nh\n\n\n, schematically show in Fig. 11) on the injection pressure development for the perforation angle 60\u00b0. The minimum principal stress is kept 20\u00a0MPa in the numerical simulation. It can be found that increase of the stress ratio will increase the critical\/breakdown pressure for this perforation angle. This is because a larger stress ratio can lead to increased stress concentration in the rock at the crack path in the model. Moreover, the pressure for fracture propagation is larger for a larger stress ratio. Fig. 18\n shows the fracture trajectories and deflection angles for different stress ratios. It can be seen that, the smaller the stress ratio, the smaller the deflection angle. For the stress ratio of 1, rock is cracked along the perforation direction with the deflection angle equal to 0. The deflection angle reaches over 60\u00b0 for the stress ratio greater than 1.1. In summary, the near-wellbore rock fracture will deflect towards the direction of the maximum principal stress over a shorter distance in a rock formation with a higher stress ratio.\nThe ratio of the perforation depth to the well radius (L\/R \u2013 L is perforation depth and R is the radius of the well) is a basic parameter for perforation design. Fig. 19\n illustrates the pressure development for the different depths of perforation with the perforation angle 60\u00b0 and the stress ratio 1.5. It can be seen that larger perforation length leads to smaller breakdown pressure. This may be because a longer perforation makes the rock fracture further away from the stress concentration zone induced by the well excavation. It may also be related to the size effect of fracture for quasi-brittle materials\n35\n as a longer crack yields more strain energy to release (larger stripe areas from above and below the crack surface). Therefore, it is helpful to design a deeper perforation to reduce the hydraulic fracking pressure. Fig. 20\n shows the fracture trajectories and deflection angles for different ratios of perforation depth to well radius. The fracture trajectories are basically similar and the deflection angle slightly decreases from 70.6\u00b0 to 67.4\u00b0 when the ratio of perforation depth to well radius increased from 1 to 3.\nTo further discuss the effect of perforation depth to fracture trajectories, comparisons of fracture trajectories and deflection angles for different stress ratios are carried out. Fig. 21\n(a) and (b) show the fracture trajectories for the stress ratios 1.05 and 1.1, respectively. It can be seen that the perforation depth significantly affects the fracture trajectories. The deeper the perforation is, the closer the fracture propagates to the perforation direction. Fig. 21(c) shows the deflection angles for the stress ratios 1.05, 1.1 and 1.5 showing that the deflection angles are decreased by increasing the perforation depth for a small stress ratio. For the stress ratio 1.1, the deflection angle is reduced from 58.4\u00b0 to 28.8\u00b0 when L\/R is increased from 1 to 3. Therefore, it can be postulated that, for rock formation with small in-situ stress difference, improving the perforation depth would be beneficial in terms of reducing the near-wellbore fracture tortuosity.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this paper, a combined analytical-numerical method has been developed to simulate the near-wellbore fracture of rock for a cased and cemented well with perforation. An analytical model for calculating the pressure acting on the wellbore surface was firstly derived. Then the pressure was accordingly updated and applied to the wellbore surface based on the analytical model and injection pressure, which was achieved by an in-house FORTRAN subroutine in the ABAQUS solver. A worked example was presented to demonstration the application of the developed model and a deflection angle was defined to describe the tortuosity of near-wellbore fracture. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results. A comprehensive parametric study was carried out to investigate the sensitivities of some key parameters on the injection pressure development and fracture trajectory. It has been found that the ratio of pressure on wellbore surface to the injection pressure (i.e., pressure transmission coefficient K) varies from about 0.2 to 0.7. The pressure transmission coefficient K decreases with the increasing of the thickness of casing and cement sheath, and Young's modulus of casing. However, with the increase of Young's modulus of the cement sheath from 2 to 40\u00a0GPa, the pressure transmission coefficient first sharply increases and then flattens roughly around 15\u00a0GPa. The larger the pressure transmission coefficient K is, the larger the breakdown pressure is and the fracture propagates more closely to the perforation orientation with a smaller deflection angle. The near-well tortuosity of the crack can be reduced by decreasing the thickness of casing and cement sheath, reducing Young's modulus of casing and increasing Young's modulus of cement up to around 15\u00a0GPa, based on the realistic range of values of the well parameters. Moreover, the larger the perforation angle is, the larger the breakdown pressure and deflection angle are. The near-wellbore fracture will deflect towards the direction of maximum principal stress in a short distance in the rock formation with a high stress difference. For a rock formation with a small stress difference, improving the perforation depth is helpful for reducing the near-wellbore fracture tortuosity. The modelling results in this paper show that the design of casing and cement sheath affects the pressure transmission on the wellbore surface, the breakdown pressure and fracture propagation near the wellbore. There is potential to affect the fracture tortuosity through understanding of the in-situ stress ahead of wellbore completion and design of the casing-cement system.\n\n","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSteep rock walls are characterized by a marked predisposition to rockfall, which is defined as the detachment and subsequent fall, bouncing, rolling, sliding, and deposition of rock fragments under the influence of gravity.\n1\n As opposed to the flow-like behavior of rock avalanches, rockfalls show no significant interaction between individual particles, meaning that their downslope propagation can be simulated by numerical models based on rigid body ballistics.\n2\n This type of landslide represents a major hazard across most populated mountain landscapes and surface mining operations, affecting high slopes as well as single bedrock outcrops. It may originate as a result of a wide variety of slope instability mechanisms, involving from single pebbles to catastrophic failure of thousands of cubic meters.\n3\n\n,\n\n4\n\n\nThe management of rockfall hazards and associated risks primarily depends on the knowledge of the whereabouts and timing of rockfall triggering. The timing is typically elusive: while accelerating displacements leading to slope collapse and ensuing rockfall have been reported,\n5\u20137\n precursors are undetectable or very short-lived when instabilities are relatively small in volume and\/or in hard rocks. Many authors have therefore focused their attention on the concept of rockfall susceptibility, namely the estimation of how likely rockfalls are at a specific site\u2014from the scale of single slopes to entire valleys. In this sense, approaches can be broadly divided into two categories: frequency\u2013magnitude distributions of future rockfall occurrence may be inferred from geological\/morphometric parameters\n8\u201312\n and the compilation of rockfall inventories\n4\n\n,\n\n13\u201317\n; alternatively, location and type of source mechanisms may be evaluated through explicit consideration of rock mass structure.\n18\u201321\n The latter approach is rooted in the notion that the development of failure mechanisms is largely governed by the intensity of rock mass jointing and the geometric arrangement of discontinuities intersecting the rock face. The tendency to instability may then be expressed in terms of factors of safety derived from deterministic\/stress-strain solutions (e.g., limit equilibrium, discrete element), or in terms of the kinematic feasibility of block movement (e.g., kinematic analysis). Deterministic\/stress-strain solutions are numerically more rigorous, but have a narrower applicability (usually limited to the analysis of selected rock compartments) and must be constrained by input data from extensive laboratory testing and fieldwork. Methods predicated on the principles of stereographic-based kinematic analysis, which aim to identify where the kinematic conditions for block detachment are theoretically met, can rather be applied expeditiously at the scale of entire slopes.\nAdvanced surveying instruments such as terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) have now become common tools for the creation of high-resolution three-dimensional models of steep rocky slopes, from which not only the morphology of the terrain, but also orientation and other relevant discontinuity properties can be extracted.\n22\u201324\n This has proved to be invaluable in vast, dangerous, or otherwise inaccessible scenarios, where traditional scanline surveying cannot be carried out. Discontinuity planes may be mapped either on polygonal meshes or directly on raw point cloud data, and typically in much greater number than what is practically achievable with traditional methods. Fitting routines may require manual input from the user\n25\n or be semi-automatic. To cite just a few examples from the second group, V\u00f6ge et al.\n26\n developed a series of algorithms to identify discontinuity planes based on the angular deviation of the nodes of polygonal meshes. Riquelme et al.\n27\n proposed a method for grouping discontinuity sets in point cloud data by means of a kernel density estimation and outlining single discontinuities by means of a density-based clustering algorithm. Matasci et al.\n21\n presented a successful application of the Coltop3D code, which allows the definition of discontinuity sets by computing dip and dip direction of each point in the cloud with respect to a set of neighbors.\nThis increased capability of collecting topographic and rock mass structural data now makes it possible to also refine the thoroughness of kinematically-based rock slope stability assessments. The present paper focuses on the enhanced quantification of rockfall hazards in steep rock walls by exploiting high-resolution point cloud data acquired from terrestrial laser scanning. The proposed analysis workflow is the outcome from a decennial research effort on the topic and multiple field experiences.\n28\u201335\n Building upon the semi-automatic extraction of key discontinuity properties by means of the established DiAna\n29\n (Discontinuity Analysis) approach, an upgraded Matlab routine (named DiAna-K) is introduced to calculate the probability of structurally controlled instabilities based on an extended three-dimensional derivation of kinematic analysis principles. Indexes of rockfall susceptibility are conceived to explicitly account for the presence of overhanging surfaces\u2014where failure of rock in tension may produce free fall mechanisms\u2014and specific friction coefficients for discontinuity sets, planes, or lines of intersection between planes. The term \u201coverhanging\u201d is herein adopted to indicate a jutting portion of the rock wall that, contrarily to \u201cnormal\u201d rock wall areas, is oriented in the direction of lower elevation. The main features of the method are highlighted by surveying a steep rock wall at an abandoned quarry near the town of Florence (Central Italy) historically affected by rockfall hazards.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nTest site and TLS survey\nThe method described in the next paragraphs was applied at the rock wall of an abandoned quarry 5\u00a0km\u00a0N of the town of Florence (Central Italy). The SSW\u2013NNE trending sub-vertical quarry face, with a height of \u223c25\u00a0m and a width of \u223c70\u00a0m, was excavated into Oligocene\u2013Miocene foredeep turbidites belonging to the Macigno Formation, consisting of an alternation of medium to thick beds (up to 10\u00a0m) of coarse-grained sandstones and thin, more sporadic beds of finer grained pelitic deposits. Instability mechanisms of different type and size arise from the changing mechanical strength and tendency to weathering across the various bedding strata, which are systematically intersected by high-angle discontinuities. A RIEGL VZ1000 terrestrial laser scanner was employed to collect high-resolution point clouds of the quarry face with a mean spacing of 8\u00a0mm. Occlusions were reduced by performing acquisitions from two different points of view, with a distance from the rock wall of 25\u201330\u00a0m. Six marker reflectors were distributed across the quarry floor, and their coordinates were surveyed with a geodetic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. This operation allowed the correct alignment and georeferencing of the point clouds. During the scan, an integrated Nikon D700 camera captured a series of partially overlapping panoramic photographs that were subsequently stitched together in order to drape the three-dimensional model of the rock wall with its true colors. The final merged point cloud, generated through use of the RiSCAN PRO software package, is composed of more than 100 million points (Fig. 1\n). The related polygonal mesh covers an area of 1043.42\u00a0m2, with a mean mesh element size of 2.06\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0m2.\n\n\n2.2\nBrief overview of DiAna and derivation of full three-dimensional kinematic analysis (Diana-K)\nModes of failure across rocky slopes can be examined using the principles of stereographic-based kinematic analysis. Developed by several authors,\n28\n\n,\n\n36\u201341\n kinematic analysis of block stability is aimed at identifying the areas of the rock face where the geometric arrangement of discontinuities renders a structurally controlled failure kinematically feasible. The approach is highly instrumental in predicting the most probable rockfall source areas and designing appropriate containment measures. Discontinuities are assumed to be infinitely persistent, and the contribution to the joint shear strength to be exclusively due to friction. The quality of outputs is naturally influenced by how well the sampled discontinuities reproduce the actual rock mass configuration. Here, an established semi-automatic approach named DiAna (Discontinuity Analysis)\n29\n was used to map discontinuities at the test site and extract six of the associated key parameters suggested by ISRM\n42\n for their quantitative description\u2014namely orientation, JRC, number of sets, spacing\/frequency, persistence, and block size. Of these, the first two can be directly inputted in subsequent kinematic analysis. Nonetheless, the kinematic tests built into the upgraded Diana-K routine may also be run by inputting discontinuity properties collected through traditional geomechanical surveying or other semi-automatic methods. Likewise, other techniques (e.g., photogrammetric surveying) may be used to input topographic data into DiAna and DiAna-K; but, in the authors\u2019 experience, TLS surveys are best able to model sharp edges and rough surfaces, which so fundamentally characterize jointed sub-vertical rock walls.\nIn short, the rationale of the original DiAna routine\n29\n consists in the creation of a voxel of space in the form of a searching cube that is iteratively moved over the raw point cloud. A least-squares fitting plane is then assigned to each sub-group of points. The user is required to select a threshold value for the standard deviation of the best fitting plane, on the basis of which the algorithm decides whether this corresponds to a valid cluster. The appropriate threshold is calibrated empirically according to searching cube size, point cloud resolution, and rock face roughness. The searching cube must contain a predefined minimum number of points\u2014also function of point cloud resolution\u2014to avoid small unrepresentative clusters. Once a valid cluster is identified, dip (\u03b1\n\np\n) and dip direction (\u03b2\n\np\n) of the fitting plane are calculated from:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03b1\np\n\n=\narctan\n\n(\n\nm\nl\n\n)\n\n+\nQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\np\n\n=\narctan\n\n(\n\nn\n\n\n\nl\n2\n\n+\n\nm\n2\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere l, m, and n are the direction cosines of the plane, while Q is a constant given by: \n\nQ\n=\n0\n\u00b0\n\n if \n\nl\n>\n0\n\n and \n\nm\n>\n0\n\n; \n\nQ\n=\n360\n\u00b0\n\n if \n\nl\n>\n0\n\n and \n\nm\n<\n0\n\n; \n\nQ\n=\n180\n\u00b0\n\n if \n\nl\n<\n0\n\n and \n\nm\n<\n0\n\n, or \n\nl\n<\n0\n\n and \n\nm\n>\n0\n\n. Clusters belonging to adjoining searching cubes and the same discontinuity set are interpreted as being part of the same discontinuity plane, and are therefore merged together. At the same time, the searching cube must be of sufficiently small size to prevent clusters belonging to two closely-spaced parallel discontinuities from being merged together. The complete discontinuity bounding polygons are eventually drawn by applying a convex hull algorithm.\nIn Diana-K, after extraction of the discontinuity properties, kinematic tests are run by singling out the terrain mesh elements, the sampled discontinuity planes, and the lines of intersection between planes that are geometrically acceptable. In other words, through an iterative process, the orientation of each mesh element is evaluated against the orientation of each sampled discontinuity plane\/intersection (or possible combination thereof). This provides additional context for the quantification of rockfall hazards, as opposed to solely making reference to the mean orientation of discontinuity sets or tightly clustered discontinuity orientations. Another notable feature is that, as the input topography is meshed from a point cloud, failure mechanisms can also be evaluated by means of dedicated kinematic tests for overhanging rock wall areas. Sets of equations describing kinematic feasibility in \u201coverhanging\u201d slopes can in fact be derived from simple stereographic-based arguments (Figs. 2\u20136\n\n\n\n\n). This allow expanding the scope of standard guidelines for kinematic analysis, whose formulation has been limited to \u201cnormal\u201d slopes\n41\n mostly because: i) the method is widely employed in excavation and surface mining projects, where rock slope designs almost never entail overhanging geometries; and ii) terrain elevation data from aerial topographic surveying\u2014of common use as analysis input\u2014are unable to capture overhanging geometries. The extended kinematic tests built into Diana-K (see Paragraphs 2.2.1\u20132.2.5) include consideration of plane, wedge, block toppling, flexural toppling, and free fall failure mechanisms, with free fall only being feasible in overhanging rock wall areas where pure tension controls block detachment (i.e., no contribution of friction and no block sliding or rotation). In accordance with suggestions by Matheson\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n and Hudson and Harrison,\n40\n distinct friction angles may be assigned to planes\/intersections.\nAt the test site, a traditional geomechanical survey was conducted along a sample scanline at the bottom of the quarried slope to acquire measurements of JRC and rebound number from Schmidt hammer testing. Discontinuities were observed to be rough and planar, with JRC measurements falling in the range 4\u201310. Such values are consistent with those extracted from DiAna, which does so by moving searching cubes of varying size along the selected discontinuity trace and measuring the scatter in dip and dip direction of locally fitted planes.\n29\n As the rock mass has relatively small extent and consistent strength properties, for convenience an average value of total friction angle (\u03c6) was assigned to each discontinuity set (Fig. 7\n) following the simplified Maksimovi\u0107\u2019s relation\n43\n for low normal stress levels:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u03c6\n=\n\n\u03c6\nb\n\n+\n2\nJ\nR\nC\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c6\n\nb\n is the basic friction angle (whose values were inferred from literature data on similar rock types).\n44\n A more selective assignment of friction angles is unnecessary for the present aim of illustrating the operational aspects of Diana-K. Moreover, as bedding moderately dips into the slope and friction is mainly mobilized along the other sets of joints dipping steeply out of the slope (Fig. 7), strength differences between these two types of discontinuity are deemed to have a minor influence on the analysis results.\n\n2.2.1\nPlane failure\nPlane failure involves sliding of the block along a basal discontinuity plane dipping out of the slope (Fig. 2). The upper end of the sliding surface is assumed to either intersect the less steep upper slope or terminate in a tension crack.\n41\n If the constraint provided by lateral margins is ignored, the conditions required for plane failure in \u201cnormal\u201d mesh elements are:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n20\n\u00b0\n<\n\n\u03b1\np\n\n<\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n+\n20\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\np\n\n<\n\n\u03c8\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\np\n\n>\n\u03c6\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b1\n\ns\n is the dip direction of the slope, \u03b1\n\np\n the dip direction of the discontinuity plane, \u03b2\n\np\n the dip of the discontinuity plane, \n\n\n\u03c8\ns\n\n=\narctan\n\n(\n\ntan\n\n\n\u03b2\ns\n\n\ncos\n\n|\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b1\np\n\n\n|\n\n\n)\n\n\n the apparent dip of the slope along the dip direction of the discontinuity plane (as derived from the true dip of the slope \u03b2\n\ns\n), and \u03c6 the available frictional strength along the discontinuity plane. In \u201coverhanging\u201d mesh elements, besides the dip of the basal plane being greater than the friction angle (Eq. (6)), the other required condition is:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u00b1\n180\n\u00b0\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n20\n\u00b0\n<\n\n\u03b1\np\n\n<\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u00b1\n180\n\u00b0\n\n)\n\n+\n20\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\nAt any given element of the polygonal mesh, the susceptibility to plane failure (S\n\npf\n) is:\n\n(8)\n\n\n\nS\n\np\nf\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nN\n\np\nf\n\n\n\/\nN\n\n\n(\n%\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere N\n\npf\n is the number of discontinuity planes satisfying Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) in \u201cnormal\u201d mesh elements or Eqs. (6) and (7) in \u201coverhanging\u201d mesh elements, and N is the total number of mapped discontinuity planes.\n\n\n2.2.2\nWedge failure\nKinematic analysis of wedge failure requires appraisal of the geometry of two mutually intersecting discontinuity planes (Fig. 3). The conditions that must be satisfied for wedge failure to occur in \u201cnormal\u201d mesh elements are:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n90\n\u00b0\n<\n\n\u03b1\ni\n\n<\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n+\n90\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\ni\n\n<\n\n\u03c8\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\ni\n\n>\n\n\u03c6\n\ne\nq\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b1\n\ni\n is the dip direction of the line of intersection between the two planes, \u03b2\n\ni\n the dip of the line of intersection between the two planes, \n\n\n\u03c8\ns\n\n=\narctan\n\n(\n\ntan\n\n\n\u03b2\ns\n\n\ncos\n\n|\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b1\ni\n\n\n|\n\n\n)\n\n\n the apparent dip of the slope along the dip direction of the line of intersection between the two planes, and \u03c6\n\neq\n is the equivalent friction angle. The use of the equivalent friction angle derives from the observation that, by simply using the mean friction angle of the two discontinuity planes (and therefore by strictly likening wedge failure to sliding of a block along the line of intersection between two discontinuity planes), Eqs. (9)\u2013(11) would be disproportionately biased towards safety.\n37\n\n,\n\n41\n In reality, stability is also controlled by the details of the geometry of the wedge, which can be expressed by the wedge factor K according to:\n\n(12)\n\n\nK\n=\n\n\nsin\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nsin\n\n\u03be\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c7 is the angle of tilt of the wedge, as seen in the plane perpendicular to the line of intersection; and \u03be is the included angle of the wedge, again as seen in the plane perpendicular to the line of intersection.\n41\n The equivalent friction angle is thus computed from:\n\n(13)\n\n\ntan\n\n\n\u03c6\n\ne\nq\n\n\n=\nK\n\ntan\n\n\n\u03c6\ni\n\n\u203e\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\n\u03c6\ni\n\n\u203e\n\n\n is the average friction angle along the line of intersection resulting from the contribution of \u03c7, \u03be, and the friction angles \u03c6\n\n1\n and \u03c6\n\n2\n along the two discontinuity planes according to:\n\n(14)\n\n\ntan\n\n\n\u03c6\ni\n\n\u203e\n\n=\n\n[\n\n\n1\n2\n\n+\n\n\ntan\n\n(\n\n\u03be\n\/\n2\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\ntan\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n\n]\n\ntan\n\n\n\u03c6\n1\n\n+\n\n[\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\ntan\n\n(\n\n\u03be\n\/\n2\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\ntan\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n\n]\n\ntan\n\n\n\u03c6\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \u201coverhanging\u201d mesh elements, wedge failure may occur if Eq.

(11) and (15) in \u201coverhanging\u201d mesh elements, and I the total number of geometrically acceptable intersections.\n\n\n2.2.3\nBlock toppling\nBlock toppling involves rotation of the displaced block about a fixed base. This mechanism typically recurs in bedded sandstone and columnar basalt formations where orthogonal jointing is well developed. Individual columns are defined by three sets of discontinuities (Fig. 4): two sets dipping steeply into the slope (i.e., sides); and a widely spaced set gently dipping out of the slope (i.e., base).\n41\n In Diana-K, sliding along the basal discontinuity may occur in addition to rotation (block-sliding toppling). The required conditions for block toppling concern the orientation of both the basal plane (\u03b1\n\np\n;\u03b2\n\np\n) and the line of intersection (\u03b1\n\ni\n;\u03b2\n\ni\n) between the two sets of lateral planes. For \u201cnormal\u201d mesh elements, these are enunciated as follows:\n\n(17)\n\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n20\n\u00b0\n<\n\n\u03b1\np\n\n<\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n+\n20\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(18)\n\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n20\n\u00b0\n<\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\ni\n\n\u00b1\n180\n\u00b0\n\n)\n\n<\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n+\n20\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(19)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\np\n\n<\n\n\u03c8\ns\n\n\n\n\nwhere in this case \u03c6 denotes the available frictional strength along the basal plane, which must be greater than the dip of the basal plane if block sliding is to be avoided.

This mechanism involves rear tensile failure and interlayer slip of the rock columns as they bend forward (Fig. 5).\n41\n Typical examples are thinly bedded rock masses in shale and slate in which orthogonal jointing is poorly developed. Kinematic analysis of flexural toppling is unable to account for the rock tensile strength, however the geometric conditions that favor its occurrence have been extrapolated by Goodman.\n36\n In Diana-K, concerning \u201cnormal\u201d mesh elements and the set of steeply dipping discontinuities (\u03b1\n\np\n;\u03b2\n\np\n), these are written in the form:\n\n(26)\n\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n20\n\u00b0\n<\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\np\n\n\u00b1\n180\n\u00b0\n\n)\n\n<\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n+\n20\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(27)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\np\n\n>\n\u03c6\n+\n\n(\n\n90\n\u00b0\n\u2212\n\n\u03c8\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere in this case \u03c8\n\ns\n is the apparent dip of the slope along the dip direction of the steep discontinuity.

Detachment occurs through pure tensile failure along at least a discontinuity (or line of intersection between discontinuities) that is steeper than the rock face; that is, the rock face must be oriented in the direction of lower elevation (\u201coverhanging\u201d) and the geometric arrangement of discontinuities adhere to the classification of underdip cataclinal slopes by Cruden.\n45\n Depending on whether a single plane is affected by tension or an intersection between planes is also involved, further distinction may be made between plane free fall failure and wedge free fall failure (Fig. 6). The required kinematic conditions for free fall can thus be expressed by:\n\n(32)\n\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n20\n\u00b0\n<\n\n\u03b1\np\n\n<\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n+\n20\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(33)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\np\n\n>\n\n\u03c8\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor, alternatively, by:\n\n(34)\n\n\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2212\n90\n\u00b0\n<\n\n\u03b1\ni\n\n<\n\n\u03b1\ns\n\n+\n90\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(35)\n\n\n\n\u03b2\ni\n\n>\n\n\u03c8\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, at any given element of the polygonal mesh, the overall susceptibility to free fall failure (S\n\nfff\n) is estimated according to:\n\n(36)\n\n\n\nS\n\nf\nf\nf\n\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\nS\n\np\nf\nf\nf\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\nS\n\nw\nf\nf\nf\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere S\n\npfff\n and I\n\nwfff\n are the susceptibilities to plane free fall failure and wedge free fall failure, respectively.

(32) and (33) and I\n\nfff\n the number of intersections that satisfy Eqs. (34) and (35). Again, N and I are the total number of mapped discontinuities and intersections, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nThe aforementioned kinematic tests help define the rock wall areas that are more prone to structurally controlled instability, namely the areas where rockfall hazard is greater. The susceptibility to rockfalls due to a certain failure mechanism can be visually assessed by draping the polygonal mesh according to a color ramp. The color of each mesh element is determined by the locally computed value, on a range from 0% to 100%, of the susceptibility index in question (as derived from Eqs. ((8), (16), (25), (31) and (36)). In general, there is no objective way to determine what constitutes a high or low rockfall susceptibility, as this depends on the spatial distribution of the computed values as well as the total number of sampled discontinuities and intersections. The procedure is not to be seen as a replacement for field observations and geomechanical analysis of single rock compartments, which are essential for examining the continuity of highly susceptible areas, the presence of weak structures, and the size of potential instabilities. Moreover, the role played by external factors in promoting rockfalls (e.g., rainfall, freeze-thaw, seismic activity, wind-induced leverage by tree roots) is necessarily neglected.\n\nFig. 7 shows the contour plot of the poles to discontinuities (equal angle, lower hemisphere projection) extracted from application of the DiAna routine at the quarry test site. It should be noted that the classification into discontinuity sets is for illustrative purposes and does not have any influence on Diana-K. The results of the rockfall susceptibility assessment are then shown in Figs. 8\u201311\n\n\n\n. A dynamic perspective of the quarry slope, intermittently overlain by the computed maps of susceptibility to the different failure mechanisms, is also provided in Supplementary Videos S1\u2013S4. It is interesting to note that wedge (Fig. 9 and Supplementary Video S2) and flexural toppling failure (Fig. 10 and Supplementary Video S3) appear to be more likely from a spatial perspective, as related indexes of susceptibility (S\n\nwf\n and S\n\nftf\n) exceed 10% in much of the rock wall area. However, as regards absolute values, indexes of susceptibility exceeding 20% are only produced by the plane (S\n\npf\n, Fig. 8 and Supplementary Video S1) and free fall mechanisms (S\n\nfff\n, Fig. 11 and Supplementary Video S4). These are concentrated in small and extremely steep areas of the rock wall. Results for block toppling are not depicted because related values of susceptibility (S\n\nbtf\n) are always lower than 1%. Fig. 12\n indicates how different failure mechanisms may be more likely in different parts of the rock wall: the single mesh elements are in fact colored based on the susceptibility index that locally acquires the greatest value, granted that at least one of them exceeds 1% (i.e., mesh elements are grayed out if no associated index of susceptibility exceeds 1%). This confirms that wedge failure, and secondarily flexural toppling, are statistically prevalent (comparatively higher S\n\nwf\n and S\n\nftf\n) at most points of the rock face, with the latter often being confined to the lower half of the slope.\nSupplementary data related to this article can be found at https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijrmms.2022.105178.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article:\n\n\nVideo S1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo S2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo S3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo S4\n\n\n\n\n\nValidation of a procedure for rockfall susceptibility assessment may be carried out in two ways: by direct observation of several rockfall events and comparison of their source location with the predicted areas of greater hazard; or by visual inspection of the rock wall to confirm whether the predicted structures are actually identifiable at the surface. The first approach may be very time consuming, as many years may need to pass before a sufficient number of detectable rockfalls occur. Since the investigated rock wall is of limited size and easily accessible, ground-truthing was deemed as an efficient mean for results validation. With the exception of the unlikely block toppling mechanism, some illustrative photographs are provided as insets to Fig. 12. These demonstrate that areas of higher computed susceptibility are consistent with the presence of block geometries that are evidently prone to the predicted mode of failure. It is also worth mentioning that high values of susceptibility to free fall and wedge failure are located in proximity of an overhanging area of the rock wall that was affected by a rockfall of approximately 100\u00a0m3 few years prior to the survey (panel \u2018a\u2019 in Fig. 12).\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThorough quantification of rockfall hazards is strictly dependent on realistic sampling of discontinuity and rock face orientations. In this sense, the proposed Diana-K approach is founded on the ability of TLS to produce three-dimensional representations of the observed scenario by measuring with millimetric to centimetric accuracy the distance of a regular pattern of millions of points in a polar coordinate system. With the ever increasing availability of computing power, the extraction of discontinuity orientations directly from raw point cloud data (as done in DiAna) is a definite advantage with respect to mesh-based applications, whose quality can be influenced by the distortion of polygonal surfaces in the triangulation process.\n24\n In Diana-K, rockfall susceptibility is subsequently assessed in similar semi-automatic manner on the basis of stereographic-based kinematic analysis, hence it is treated as a geometric problem solely driven by rock mass structure and rock face orientation. Complex geometries involving multiple basal, rear, and lateral release surfaces are not taken into consideration. The analysis also excludes processes of intact rock fracture and external forces such as water pressures or reinforcement, which can significantly influence stability. Design procedures should entail preliminary kinematic analysis to identify where the conditions for block sliding or rotation are more pronounced, and then focused deterministic\/stress-strain analysis to infer local factors of safety.\n41\n\n\nPredictions of kinematic instability have mostly been carried out in previous studies by combining the orientation of mesh elements (or point cloud data) with the mean orientation of discontinuity sets.\n21\n\n,\n\n46\n This is a major simplification with respect to the natural scatter of discontinuity orientations in rock masses. To better deal with the issue, some authors\n47\n\n,\n\n48\n proposed to treat discontinuity orientation as a random variable, as for example in a Monte Carlo framework. These works proved that, in rough rock faces with markedly non-uniform orientation, little variations in input structural data may lead to kinematic evaluations significantly biased towards unsafety. Diana-K overcomes the uncertainties inherent to modeling the distribution of discontinuity orientations, since these are comprehensively sampled from TLS data. Probabilistic context is rather provided by coupling iteratively each mesh element with the orientation of each mapped discontinuity\/intersection (or possible combination thereof). It is therefore assumed that any mapped discontinuity\/intersection may intersect a given point of the rock face. Local susceptibility to a certain mode of failure is consequently expressed by the relative amount of features theoretically able to satisfy the associated kinematic requirements.\nThe Diana-K routine also allows incorporation of additional spatial arguments by assigning distinct weighting factors (D\n\nw\n) to the discontinuity planes inputted at each iteration step of kinematic analysis. This is aimed at yielding results that better reflect local rock mass conditions, and is achieved by measuring the distance (D) between the center of gravity of the discontinuity planes and the center of gravity of the mesh element under analysis. On the basis of two user-defined parameters, namely threshold distance (T\n\nd\n) and maximum weight (M\n\nw\n), the probabilistic role played by a discontinuity in increasing rockfall susceptibility at a given element of the polygonal mesh is estimated by rounding towards the nearest integer the following equation:\n\n(39)\n\n\n\nD\nw\n\n=\n\nM\nw\n\n\n[\n\n(\n\n\nT\nd\n\n\u2212\nD\n\n)\n\n\/\n\nT\nd\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEq. (39) indicates that discontinuities located at a distance from the analyzed mesh element greater than T\n\nd\n are excluded from related calculations of rockfall susceptibility. Conversely, discontinuities located at a distance equal to or shorter than T\n\nd\n appear in the input sample as many times as the weighting factor D\n\nw\n. This adjustment is justified especially for large rock walls, where different structural domains may prevail in different sectors of the point cloud. Similarly, instead of exploiting values that are averaged for each discontinuity set (as done in this study), field observations may motivate the assignment of specific friction angles to highly weathered or damaged discontinuities of substantially weaker strength.\nEven though the presented quarry test site is characterized by a relatively straightforward jointing pattern, the results highlight the importance of properly addressing the sub-vertical nature of rock walls. While the kinematic feasibility of wedge and flexural toppling failure is comparatively dominant over most portions of the surveyed face, in absolute terms the highest hazard is attributed to plane and free fall mechanisms potentially originating from highly steep areas of limited extent. This kind of distinction, related to the presence of small-scale overhangs, may not be obtained from traditional methods of rockfall hazard assessment that employ airborne-based digital elevation models.\n10\n\n,\n\n20\n\n,\n\n49\n\n,\n\n50\n On a similar note, Matasci et al.\n21\n stressed the impact of exfoliation-type discontinuities (i.e., discontinuities that are sub-parallel to the rock face) on rockfall susceptibility in granitic and debuttressed hard rock masses. In cases where the probability of failure related to exfoliation discontinuities is relevant, a module of the Diana-K routine can be switched on to calculate an \u201cexfoliation susceptibility index\u201d: this serves to count how many discontinuity planes have a dip within a predefined range (e.g., \u00b110\u00b0) from the dip of a given element of the polygonal mesh.\nAnother relevant information is the assessment of the overall susceptibility to rockfalls, regardless of mode of failure. It is in fact reasonable to expect that rockfalls will be more frequent in areas where kinematic freedom is achievable through multiple block geometries. Overall rockfall susceptibility can be captured by a Global Kinematic Index (GKI):\n\n(40)\n\n\nG\nK\nI\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nS\n\np\nf\n\n\n\u2212\n\nN\n\nf\nf\nf\n\n\n\u2212\n\nS\n\nf\nt\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nS\n\nw\nf\n\n\n\u2212\n\nI\n\nf\nf\nf\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nS\n\nb\nt\nf\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere symbols have already been introduced in previous equations. The first term in parenthesis defines the contribution to rockfall susceptibility from the unfavorable orientation of discontinuity planes, the second term by the unfavorable orientation of lines of intersection, and the third term is solely descriptive of block toppling since this mechanism is simultaneously controlled by both planes and intersections. Results from GKI calculation at the quarry test site imply that, in the most critical area of the rock wall (i.e., the mesh element where GKI is highest), 43% of the inputted structural features are theoretically able to promote at least one mechanism of kinematic instability (Fig. 13\n and Supplementary Video S5). Illustrative photos in Fig. 13 highlight that multiple feasible modes of failure, conspicuous rock mass damage, and freshly exposed rockfall scars can be discerned in areas of high GKI.\nWith reference to active surface mining operations and artificial slopes in general, another implication of the proposed procedure is that it offers a framework to search for the geometric configuration of the excavation that best minimizes rockfall hazards. A sensitivity analysis can be performed to understand how indexes of rockfall susceptibility are influenced by the dip and dip direction of the cut face. For example, variations of GKI may be examined by hypothesizing different dip increments for a fixed dip direction of the cut face; or alternatively, by hypothesizing different dip direction increments for a fixed dip of the cut face.\n28\n This is particularly relevant in open-pit mines: as cut faces take the full range of possible dip directions, their dip may be adjusted from one pit sector to the other in order to meet a targeted level of safety. Knowledge of feasible instability mechanisms is also informative for interpreting the geometry of slope movement vectors, which in turn can significantly affect the measurement accuracy of line-of-sight slope monitoring techniques such as ground-based interferometric radar.\n51\n Displacement\/velocity data may be corrected by estimating the sensitivity of the sensor against the estimated direction of slope movement, thus providing valuable context for the appropriate assessment of ongoing instabilities and the calibration of related alarms.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe presented analysis workflow is concerned with the thorough quantification of rockfall hazards from remotely sensed surface data. It exploits semi-automatic routines for the extraction of discontinuity planes (DiAna) as well as the assessment of structurally controlled rockfall susceptibility scenarios (DiAna-K). The procedure is not to be viewed as a univocal replacement for traditional geomechanical surveying, but rather as an approach that becomes an inevitable necessity to practitioners who must collect data in vast, dangerous, or otherwise inaccessible environments. Potential modes of failure identified at the quarry test site agree well with evidences gathered in the field, with the added benefit given by the ability to rapidly investigate areas of large extent and marked steepness\u2014including truly overhanging rock faces. Further steps, among which the possibility to assign spatial weighting and distinct friction angles, can be taken to better incorporate the characteristics of single discontinuities\/intersections into the analysis of complex scenarios. Further verification of the method could be conducted by integrating the kinematic analysis outputs with spatially continuous slope deformation data or detailed rockfall inventories at sites of frequent rockfall occurrence, with the goal of deriving explicit correlations between statistically likely (i.e., predicted) and actually ongoing instabilities. The code implemented into the Diana and Diana-K routines may be promptly run on a MATLAB environment even by users who do not possess advanced programming skills.\n\n","35":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe method of hydraulic fracturing (HF) is widely used in reservoir engineering development and in in-situ stress measurement. It is applied to conventional oil and gas extraction, shale gas, and enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and has become a major research and engineering topic in a large variety of geological conditions. Previous studies have revealed that hydraulic fracturing behavior in crystalline rock (e.g., granite) for geothermal purposes is highly dependent on the present minerals as well as on their grain size and heterogeneity.\n1\u20133\n The fracture growth behaviour in crystalline rock is quite different from that is observed in sedimentary rock (e.g., sandstone), which is considered in oil and gas fracturing.\n4\u20136\n\n\nThe grain-scale heterogeneity of rock has been found to greatly affect crack growth behavior in mechanical fracturing tests. However, rock microstructure has been insufficiently considered in hydraulic fracturing tests (i.e., fluid-driven fracturing). Recent grain-based numerical modeling work reported unique behavior in terms of asymmetric fracture growth, zipper-mode crack initiation, and the partial re-closure of previous cracks in crystalline rock.\n7\u20139\n Cracks can be induced in mineral grains (intragranular or transgranular cracking) or along grain interfaces (grain-boundary cracks).\n8\n\n,\n\n10\n An in-depth analysis of the hydraulic fracture path (including acoustic emission monitoring) can shed some light on the fluid-driven fracture nucleation and fracture propagation process.\n11\n\n,\n\n12\n While crack nucleation models are available for the mechanical loading of crystalline (wing cracks)\n13\n and sedimentary rock (pore cracks),\n14\n fluid-driven fracture nucleus and growth path models remain sparse. For example, Lu et al. (2018, 2019) presented a time-dependent hydraulic fracture initiation model that incorporates a subcritical crack growth index and applied this model to data from laboratory experiments on granite, sandstone, and limestone.\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n Both the stress intensity factor at the fracture tip and the fracture toughness (critical stress intensity factor of Mode I cracks) play a key role in the damage mechanics of rock fatigue.\n17\n Furthermore, a fracture mechanics framework for hydraulic fatigue in rock was proposed and applied to data from granitic rock experiments at three different scales (laboratory, mine and field).\n18\n\n\nAt laboratory scale, one focus of hydraulic fracturing experimental study is to compare different injection styles, such as continuous and cyclic injection. Hydraulic fracturing test results in both dry and saturated Tennessee sandstone (6% porosity) have shown that fracturing via cyclic injection had increased the fracture permeability by a factor of three to ten compared with conventional HF.\n5\n This finding was confirmed in a recent study on tight sandstone.\n19\n For Tennessee sandstone, breakdown pressure (BP) reduction via cyclic injection was only found in dry samples, but not for the saturated samples. It is therefore reasonable to argue that the decrease in BP in dry samples can be largely attributed to the reduction in tensile strength because fluid injection over several cycles had saturated the sample to a certain extent. A laboratory study reported that cyclic injection that employs stepwise pressurization can reduce the monotonic BP of tight and porous sandstones of 1.05% and 13.24% porosity by 7% and 19%, respectively.\n20\n In addition, a recent study reported that cyclic hydraulic fracturing (CHF) can reduce fracture surface roughness in glutenite rock.\n21\n Both pre-breakdown cyclic injection that aims at BP reduction and the post-breakdown cyclic injection that aims to enhance permeability have been discussed in previous studies.\n5\n\n,\n\n22\n Laboratory investigations in Pocheon granite have demonstrated that \u2013 compared with HF, CHF can reduce BP by up to 20%, mitigate the maximum amplitude of seismic events occurs during the fracturing, and creates more complex fractures.\n23\n In addition, our previous study on the same granite, which was tested under true triaxial stress conditions, found that intragranular cracking dominates for all the specimens while the injection scheme greatly influences the fracture path.\n10\n Mine-scale experiments in granite have revealed that CHF can reduce the BP of granite by 10\u201320%; however, permeability enhancement via CHF is less pronounced compared with that via conventional HF.\n24\n\n,\n\n25\n Moreover, numerical modeling has revealed that CHF has the potential to reduce the occurrence of larger-magnitude seismic events in field stimulation.\n26\n At field scale, cyclic water injection has typically been used in field tests to improve the oil recovery rate in sandstone formations.\n27\n Progressive cyclic injection was reported in hydraulic stimulation of the GPK1 well at the Soultz EGS site and was shown to have lowered the injection pressure for fracture propagation in granite formations.\n28\n\n\nThe above-reviewed study revealed that the behavior of HF varies for different rock types and different injection conditions. Mechanism of cyclic injection varies in different rocks and even in the same granitic rocks, because of their different mechanical structures. Hydraulic fatigue does not necessarily occur in every case. To gain a more-in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanism of hydraulic fatigue in different types of rock, we selected one fine-grained sandstone and two coarse-grained granites with different fractions of minerals (e.g., quartz, biotite) and different initial defect distributions (i.e., microcracks) in order to investigate their effect on high-cycle hydraulic fatigue experiments with a particular focus on the fluid-driven fracture path at the scale of heterogeneous mineral assembly.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\nTwo types of coarse-grained granite and one fine-grained sandstone were used for hydraulic fracturing experiments in the laboratory. Fig. 1\n presents typical optical microscopic images of the three types of rock before the fracturing experiments had taken place. Pocheon granite (PG) was obtained from the Pocheon area in South Korea. This granite has been frequently used in studies on mechanical and hydraulic fracturing behavior and is composed of 35.7% quartz (Qz), 35.9% orthoclase (Or) mixed with plagioclase (Pl), 25.8% microcline (Mc), and 2.6% biotite (Bt). PG is coarse-grained with an average grain size of around 2.0\u00a0mm and 3.2\u00a0mm measured in the short- and the long-axis, respectively. It has moderate anisotropy due to abundant microcracks \u2013 that is, the Brazilian tensile strength ranges from 7.72 to 10.22\u00a0MPa for the three cleavages of rift, grain, and hardway. For detailed physical and mechanical properties (including the anisotropy effect), we refer to Zhuang et al. (2020).\n30\n Gonghe granite (GG) was taken from the outcrop in the Gonghe area of China, where EGS projects are currently under development.\n31\n GG is composed of 50.2% plagioclase, 21.4% quartz, 13.4% biotite, and 9.4% orthoclase as well as other minor minerals, such as hornblende.\n32\n The fraction of biotite is higher compared with that in Pocheon granite, and biotite in GG is either platy or nondescript in terms of grain shape. The average grain size of GG is \u223c 0.9\u00a0mm and 1.5\u00a0mm measured in the short- and the long-axis, respectively, which is approximately half the average grain size in PG. The gray sandstone (GS) is composed of 53.6% quartz, 22.4% albite, 10.5% calcite, 8.1% muscovite, 2.9% biotite, and 2.7% chlorite. The sample has a porosity of 8.98% and a mean particle size of \u223c 0.1\u00a0mm, and was evaluated as being relatively uniform with no significant bedding. Table 1\n summarizes and compares the main physical and mechanical properties of the three types of rock. In particular, the Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) \u2013 which directly influences BP for the tensile-dominated hydraulic fracturing process \u2013 was reduced by full saturation at about 2.6%, 10.5%, and 42.9% for PG, GG, and GS, respectively. The saturated samples were stored in a water-filled vacuum chamber for more than 12\u00a0h.\n29\n All the right-circular cylindrical specimens had a diameter of 50\u00a0mm and height of 100\u00a0mm with a concentric through-going borehole of 5\u00a0mm in diameter (d) (Fig. 2\n). In addition to the grain size effect, borehole size effect also exists in laboratory hydraulic fracturing tests. Our previous study in the same PG has shown that the monotonic breakdown pressure decreases with increasing borehole size of 5\u201314\u00a0mm.\n3\n The borehole diameter determined in this study is larger than the mean grain size in the two granites.\nHydraulic fracturing experiments were conducted on the triaxial testing system that had been introduced in a previous study.\n23\n Tap water was injected from the bottom of the specimen with a clamping vertical pressure of 10\u00a0MPa in order to prevent leakage between the borehole and the loading plate. Confining pressure was set to zero in order to allow hydraulic fracturing experiments to be conducted without a triaxial cell, and acoustic emission sensors could therefore be directly installed on the sample surface. As shown in Fig. 2d, six Nano-30 sensors provided by the MISTRAS company were glued to the specimen surface via wax couplant, and plastic bands were used to avoid loose contact between the sensors and rock specimen during the long-duration high-cycle fatigue injection test. In this study, the maximum duration time of tests performed was \u223c 75\u00a0h, and the maximum number of cycles was 6200. Volume-rate-controlled continuous (one cycle) and cyclic injection (multiple cycles) were applied (Fig. 3\n). Continuous injection employed a constant injection rate of 50\u00a0mm3\/s until hydraulic breakdown, while in cyclic injection, 50\u00a0mm3\/s and zero injection rates alternated for one cycle. The durations of high-rate and low-rate injection were determined by the upper and lower limits of the injection pressure, respectively. The duration highly relies on the hydraulic performance of the specimen and could therefore vary after any new crack had been created in the specimen. As the radial dissipation of fluid pressure in the borehole takes a long time for low-permeability rock, the interval for the zero injection was fixed to 120\u00a0s for PG, to 480\u00a0s for GG, and to 60\u00a0s for GS, thereby allowing the injection pressure drop to a relatively low value (i.e., <20%) compared with the upper limit of the injection pressure during the high-rate injection. Previous studies have pointed out that the injection duration and the interval may influence the total number of cycles required to breakdown the specimen.\n10\n\n,\n\n32\n\n,\n\n33\n However, this influence was not investigated in the present study.\n\n\n3\nHydraulic fracturing test results\nMeasurements including BP, maximum AE amplitude, and fracture geometric properties are listed in Table 2\n for comparison between different tests cases. The average monotonic BP during the continuous injection test (BPaver) was 4.34\u00a0MPa, 7.37\u00a0MPa, and 9.98\u00a0MPa for GS, PG, and GG, respectively. Compared with the BPaver, there was an average of 12.2%, 15.7%, and 19.9% reduction in BP during the CHF, respectively. For the tensile-dominated HFs created in intact granite and sandstone specimens, BP was affected by rock tensile strength, in -situ stresses, and fluid infiltration. The reduction in BP by CHF can therefore be attributed to several factors, such as hydraulic fatigue due to cyclic injection and the reduction in tensile strength as the sample approached saturation with increasing duration of water injection. As shown in Table 1, measurements of BTS under fully saturated conditions show a 2.6%, 10.5%, and 42.9% decrease compared with those of the dry sample for PG, GG, and GS, respectively. In addition, the difference between BPs of initially dry and saturated PG specimens during a continuous injection is insignificant.\n30\n The reduction in BP was higher than that of BTS for the two granites, while the opposite result was found for GS. In addition, the sandstone could be saturated via water injection more quickly compared with in the two granites due to its relatively much-higher porosity and permeability. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the effect of hydraulic fatigue on BP reduction is more significant in granite, as discussed in Section 5.\n\nFig. 4\n presents the results of the number of cycles (N) in CHF at different levels of maximum injection pressure. In our previous study, we found a maximum of around 20% reduction of injection pressure for PG by CHF with a higher injection rate of 100\u00a0mm3\/s, and the number of cycles (N\u00a0=\u00a02 to 600) required to breakdown the rock increased with increasing maximum injection pressure.\n23\n The latter findings was also observed for all 18 cases of CHF in PG performed in this study at a relatively lower injection rate of 50\u00a0mm3\/s. Among all the fatigue test cases, we observed the maximum number of 6200 cycles for GG, 839 for PG, and 151 for GS. These values differ by nearly two orders of magnitude. Here, we intentionally label the CHF test with large cycles as a case of high-cycle hydraulic fracturing (e.g., N\u00a0>\u00a0100). This is in contrast to high-cycle fatigue experiments performed on metals, in which the numbers are much higher (e.g., 10,000 cycles). In our opinion, these numbers need to be adapted since rock- and metal-fatigue micro-processes can differ significantly.\n\nTable 2 also lists the average measurements (including standard deviations) of the maximum amplitudes of AE hit and AE event recorded during hydraulic fracturing. As sensor sensitivity (e.g., wax couplant) could vary slightly in different test cases and this variance could influence the magnitude of AE signals, we compared the average value of the maximum AE amplitude. The maximum amplitude of AE events was smaller compared with that of AE hits for the same test case as one event had been decided based on multiple signals received from at least four sensors and its maximum AE amplitude had been defined as the magnitude of the first AE signal to arrive. The average maximum amplitude of AE hits is plotted via the average BP in Fig. 5\na. In general, the maximum AE amplitude showed higher values in the two granites compared with those in the sandstone, which is mainly because attenuation and damping effects play a more prominent role in porous sandstone than in low-porosity crystalline rock, such as granite. In addition, the maximum AE amplitude showed higher values in HF tests compared with in CHF tests for the same rock type. The average maximum amplitude based on AE hits in CHF dropped by 17.5\u00a0dB, 7.5\u00a0dB, and 4.6\u00a0dB, respectively, compared with those in HF, which corresponds to a weakening rate of 17%, 8%, and 6%, for GG, PG, and GS, respectively. When comparing the amplitudes of AE events (Table 2), the gap narrowed.\nWe also measured fracture aperture in typical CT images (representing the maximum fracture aperture) for each case. It should be noted that the aperture was measured on the fractured specimens that were free of in situ stresses and injection pressure. Automatic fracture detection in selected CT images was conducted by employing the Faster R\u2013CNN (region-based convolutional neural network) algorithm combined with the rotated bounding box method.\n34\n Fracture aperture was averaged on the total length of the fracture in a typical CT image. In Fig. 5b, we compare the average fracture aperture (a) together with standard deviations between HF and CHF for each type of rock. The difference was most significant in PG, is second-most significant in GG, and is insignificant in GS. Average crack apertures were smaller in CHF tests as compared with HF tests. The mean fracture aperture was also plotted with the maximum amplitude of AE hit (Fig. 5c). Compared with CHF, HF data occur at the outer rim of the data set. The data points were separated by rock type (shown in the sub-figures in Fig. 5c) and we employed dash lines in order to separate the data points falling into four regions. The data points in the upper right region correspond to the high AE amplitude and large fracture apertures, which were achieved by the monotonic injection (i.e., HF). That is, there is no way to generate larger AE and larger crack apertures with CHF compared to HF treatment.\nAdditionally, we found a general trend in PG that both the maximum injection pressure (P\nmax) needed to achieve breakdown and the average fracture aperture (a) decreased with an increasing number of cycles, as shown in Fig. 6\n. Their relationships can be approximately fitted by a logarithm function, as in Eq. (1):\n\n(1)\n\nP\nmax or a\u00a0=\u00a0Alog(N)\u00a0+\u00a0B\n\n\nwhere A and B are material-dependent constants and A is negative. BP This high-cycle fatigue analysis was performed for the PG with considerable test cases only.\nIt is interesting to note that the relation above (hydraulic fatigue with fluid involved) is similar what is known as W\u00f6hler curve in mechanical fatigue (no fluid involved). The classical W\u00f6hler curve describes cyclic fatigue behavior as a straight line in a semi-logarithmic plot of the log number of loading cycles versus the normalized ratio of maximum cycle stress to monotonic rock strength.\n35\n We see the documented logarithmic behavior of breakdown pressure and fracture aperture with number of injection cycles as an important finding of the hydraulic fatigue process, and in line with mechanical fatigue of rock.\n\n\n4\nAnalysis of hydraulic fracture path at grain scale\nCompared with sandstone composed of a majority of sand-sized silicate grain, most granite is typically multi-mineral rock with common types of minerals, such as quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and biotite. Grain size and mineral composition in granite have been reported to have a significant influence on hydraulic fracturing behavior.\n2\n\n,\n\n11\n To further understand both how hydraulic fracture are formed and the impact of different minerals, we conducted CT observations and microscopic examinations (thin-section analysis) on the hydraulic fracture path in the fractured specimens. The thin sections were decided at cross-sections showing the relatively large-aperture fractures based on CT scanning results of the fractured specimens. Typically, they appeared at the top half of the specimen, 10\u00a0mm away from the top surface.\n\n4.1\nHydraulic fracture geometry\n\nFig. 7\n displays a typical CT image of the cross-section of the cylindrical specimens in CHF tests in the three types of rock. Fig. 8\n presents typical microscopic images of selected thin-sections in CHF tests from the three types of rock. For more CT images and microscopic images of both HF and CHF tests, we refer to the Supplementary Information (Figs. S1\u2013S6). The yellow color indicates the hydraulic fracture path. Defects in fractured samples are infilled with epoxy resin with yellow dyes via suction in order to enhance the observation of the fractures. As can be confirmed from Figs. 7 and 8 and the Supplementary Information, bi-wing fractures are frequently generated along both sides of a borehole but are not always oriented in the same direction. In most cases, a fracture on one side of the borehole is larger than that on the other side (asymmetric bi-wings). The large fracture half-length and tortuosity are measured for all the test cases, and their average values are listed in Table 2. Fracture tortuosity was 1.03\u20131.07 in the two granites, which was slightly higher than the 1.02 measured in the sandstone. There was little difference for the large fracture half-length between HF and CHF for PG and GS, though the reason for this was different for the two different rocks. Unlike in the sandstone, in which most hydraulic fractures in both HF and CHF were relatively straight (Fig. 7c), hydraulic fractures created by CHF in some individual cases of PG were tortuous; however, they were not able to propagate to the outside boundary and thus lowered the average fracture length (Fig. S1b). Our previous study on a 100-mm cubic specimen of the same PG under true triaxial stress conditions reported a tortuosity of around 1.03\u20131.1 depending on different injection schemes, including cyclic injection.\n10\n In the present study, the ratio of intragranular and intergranular (grain-boundary) fractures in PG is approximately 4:1, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), which is quantitatively consistent with our previous findings in hydraulic fracturing of the same PG.\n10\n One previous study found that the bonding strength between grain boundaries was usually lower than the tensile strength of the individual minerals \u2013 that is, quartz and feldspar.\n36\n The fraction of grain-boundary fractures in GG is \u223c 35% in the case of Figs. 8c and 49% in Fig. 8d, both of which are higher than the corresponding fraction observed in PG. The difference between the two granites is closely related to mineral compositions. For example, PG is composed of a large number of quartz grains that are more fractured while GG has a larger proportion of biotite. We further analyze the role of quartz and biotite grains during fracture propagation below.\n\nFig. 8(e) and (f) display microscope images and backscattered electron composition (BEC) images, respectively, for two fractured sandstone specimens in CHF. Breakage of both sand grains and cements occurred along the fracture path. Fracture branching was not observed at the borehole scale (>1\u00a0mm), though it was confirmed at the grain scale (0.1\u00a0mm). The phenomenon of branching is recognized as damage zones. In addition, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis on the fractures indicates the presence of illite and carbonate.\n37\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nSecondary fracture\nSecondary fractures were less common in the sandstone compared with those in the two granites. In addition, we observed hydraulic fracture branching that was more obvious in CHF compared with in HF in the two granites (e.g., Fig. 8a\u2013d), which is consistent with our previous findings.\n23\n Compared with the continuous injection in HF, cyclic injection with long duration created a larger infiltration zone with an increasing number of cycles. As a result, tensile cracks or hydro-shears could be generated farther away from the borehole in addition to the hydraulic fracture initiated at the early stage.\n3\n\nFig. 8a shows an example in PG in which multiple fractures were initiated at the borehole wall, but only one fracture continued to propagate as the main hydraulic fracture with relatively larger aperture and fracture length.\n\nFig. 8c displays a typical case that occurred in high-cycle hydraulic fracturing of GG with 1600 cycles of injection. Bi-wing fractures were formed at the beginning, whereas the main hydraulic fracture deviated from the initial propagation direction on one side and a secondary fracture was observed at the fracture intersection point that was aligned with the new propagation direction. For a detailed observation of the relative locations, 3D CT reconstruction of the two fractures and mineral grains adjacent to the fractures was conducted, as shown in Fig. 9\n. Compared with the CT image before fracturing, we confirmed that the secondary fracture had occurred along a pre-existing natural crack. The hydraulic fracture met the crack with an approach angle of around 40\u00b0 and then activated the pre-existing flaw together with crack dilation (aperture increase). We attribute this type of interaction between hydraulic fracture and a pre-existing crack to the high-cycle fatigue process. Hydraulic energy is spent in order to promote fractures in a larger portion of weak volumes of rock that are affected by the fatigue process, and to enhance further fluid infiltration. Depressurization (relaxation) phases in the cyclic injection allow the fracture path to be reoriented in terms of lower energy (pre-existing flaw direction), which is prevented in conventional hydraulic fracturing since the pressure is increased monotonically (no relaxation phases). In another case, a pre-existing crack in GG was located almost perpendicular to the direction of hydraulic fracture propagation, and HF was arrested by the natural obstacle, as shown in Fig. S6(c).\n\n\n4.3\nThe role of quartz grains in the hydraulic fracturing of granite\nIn comparison with GG, PG has a three-times-larger fraction of quartz grains, and pre-existing microcracks are abundant in quartz grains, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b). These microcracks enable PG to have a permeability of around two orders of magnitude higher than that of almost impermeable granite. It can therefore be expected that for the same duration, the fluid infiltration volume via cyclic injection in PG should be larger. In addition, fractured quartz grains have lower tensile strength compared with that of other grains, and fluid pressure is more-easily built surrounding fractured quartz clusters because they are relatively more permeable due to microcracks. As a result, we observed more quartz grains distributed along hydraulic fractures in PG that consisted of both intragranular fractures in quartz grains and intergranular fractures between quartz and other minerals. For the PG specimen fractured by 109 cycles in Fig. 8(a) and (b), the total fraction of hydraulic fractures involved with quartz grains was \u223c 47%. This can also be one reason why quartz fragments can serve as natural proppants more frequently during the fatigue hydraulic fracturing process, in particular under the conditions of cyclic injection combined with pulse pressure, which has been reported in previous study.\n10\n\n,\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n4.4\nThe role of biotite plates in the hydraulic fracturing of granite\nBiotite (platy minerals) often presents in a shape with a relatively higher aspect ratio than other major minerals, such as quartz and feldspar, as has been confirmed via CT and microscope images. Mineral orientation influences fracture propagation and sometimes enables the hydraulic fracture to be more tortuous. For example, previous study has identified mica plates in granitic rock as one reason for increased hydraulic fracture tortuosity.\n3\n Intragranular fracture in biotite usually propagates along its short axis, particularly in GG (Fig. 8c and d). Intergranular fractures along the grain boundary of biotite are frequently observed. In general, more biotite grains interact with the hydraulic fracture in GG compared with in PG, largely because biotite content is 2.6 times higher in GG.\nFor the same rock, fractures created by CHF show slightly higher tortuosity than those created by HF in GG, while the difference is negligible for PG and GS. One observation from CT images provided the reason that hydraulic fracture can suddenly change its orientation during its propagation when meeting specific mineral grains, such as the platy or elongate-shaped biotite (Fig. 7a and b), and the maximum change in orientation was estimated to be larger than 20\u00b0. It should be noted that differential horizontal stress was not able to be considered in this study. As a result, fracture propagation was simply controlled by the intrinsic rock microstructure. We expected a stress deviator to support the fracture path tortuosity because favorably oriented platy minerals or foliation should reactivate due to stress differences that also exist farther away from the hydraulic fracture path. When the maximum principal stress is parallel to the preferred mineral orientation or foliation, the hydraulic fracture propagates along the foliation and is relatively straight; otherwise hydraulic fracture propagation deviates from the direction of maximum principal stress when meeting weak local structures, and fracture path thus becomes longer and more tortuous.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nHigh-cycle hydraulic fatigue behaviour at long-duration injection\nIn this section, we try to separate the effect of number of injection cycles and the duration of injection cycles on failure behavior of rock although in the experiments one cannot rule out their combined impact on sample failure during the fatigue process. While the logarithmic number of injection cycles is important for the linear decrease in breakdown pressure of rock, the tensile-strength degradation due to tap water rock interaction is important to understand long-duration injection behavior of rock.\n\n5.1\nTensile-strength degradation induced by long-duration cyclic injection\nOne previous study in addition to the present investigation has shown that the effects of cyclic injection on both BP and crack formation are highly rock-type dependent.\n1\n In general, a BP reduction in CHF can be attributed both to hydraulic fatigue at the mineral scale and to strength degradation at the macro-scale (the core scale in the present study), and these two aspects are closely correlated. Here, we consider the hydraulic fracturing process to simply be separated into the two phases of initiation and propagation (crack interaction and coalescence are not considered because the focus is on single bi-wing hydraulic fractures). In fracture mechanics, fracture toughness plays the key role in the initiation phase, while in the propagation phase, mineral- and bonding-strength at micro-scale and the intact rock strength (tensile strength in case of tensile failure) at macro-scale plays the key role in determining how the fracture morphology develops in terms of fracture aperture, length, tortuosity.\n7\u20139\n\n,\n\n38\n Tensile strength degradation via water saturation is significant in high-porosity sandstones, and could reach beyond 40\u201350% of tensile strength at full saturation. As a result, BP reduction in CHF could be more significant in sandstone during the initially dry state compared with during the saturated state. For example, Patel et al. (2017) reported that cyclic injection can reduce BP in dry Tennessee sandstone (6% porosity), but not for the fully saturated specimen.\n5\n The degree of saturation increases with an increasing number of injection cycles in initially dry porous sandstone specimens. Unlike in porous sandstone, tensile strength degradation with water saturation in most granites is less important. For example, PG shows only a limited decrease of 2.6%. For low-permeability granite containing few microcracks and mainly closed pores, such as GG in this study, it is impossible to fully saturate the granite specimen even under the long duration of cyclic injection. In addition, our previous study has uncovered that there is no significant difference in the monotonic breakdown pressure for dry and saturated PG specimens.\n29\n\n\n\n\n5.2\nHigh-cycle fatigue\nHydraulic fatigue is a combined effect of cyclic loading in fracture and fluid infiltration that involves both the impact of subcritical crack growth under given fluid injection conditions and the impact of fracture propagation (fracture path complexity and tortuosity). Fatigue hydraulic fracturing (FHF) is a general, umbrella term used to group hydraulic fatigue processes in rock mass using pressure cycles (cyclic hydraulic fracturing) and\/or pressure oscillations such as hydraulic pulse (pulse hydraulic fracturing).\n3\n\n,\n\n24\n Cyclic and pulse hydraulic fracturing are sub-groups of fatigue hydraulic fracturing. In addition, the term pneumatic hydraulic fracturing has recently been introduced when replacing the fracturing fluid by a pressurized gas medium,\n39\n which can be seen as another subgroup of FHF. Cyclic loading under either quasi-static or dynamic condition was reported to cause accumulative damage inside the sample before the ultimate failure, as determined from micro-scale investigations on the failure pattern.\n40\u201343\n Hydraulic fatigue is different from mechanical fatigue. The impact of fluid infiltration cannot be ignored, even for granite with relatively low permeability.\n10\n\n,\n\n23\n\n,\n\n29\n In fact, we directly observed that injection water flowed out of the specimen during cyclic injection in all the three types of rock, as we had removed the triaxial cell and confining stress had not been employed in the present study. Infiltration volume increases with increasing cycles of injection as defects (pores and microcracks) and grain boundaries (i.e., quartz) provide a fluid pathway.\n44\n However, for relatively low-permeability granite, many cycles are required to build a certain fluid infiltration volume. According to the Haimson and Fairhurst breakdown model, injection fluid leak-off and consequent the poroelastic effect in granite matrix enable the monotonic breakdown pressure to be reduced, compared with theoretical model on impermeable rocks.\n45\n\n,\n\n46\n Our previous study has pointed out the much higher monotonic breakdown pressure in PG if fluid infiltration was excluded.\n47\n On top of the fluid infiltration effect, in this study, we further discuss on the high-cycle fatigue possibly has further reduced the monotonic breakdown pressure, due to a different fracture propagation pattern.\nThe number of loading cycles (N) required to breakdown the rock specimen varies from case to case. Previous studies have reported that in general, N increases with decreasing maximum injection pressure.\n23\n\n,\n\n32\n However, this finding is affected by other factors, such as the durations of the injection at low and high pressure as well as the rock type. Nevertheless, hard evidence on the influence of the durations in cyclic injection have not yet been reported despite a preliminary investigation.\n33\n A few studies have discussed delayed hydraulic fracture initiation, in which the time of breakdown (in logarithmic scale) decreases with increasing wellbore pressure.\n16\n\n,\n\n48\n\n,\n\n49\n The subcritical crack growth index was employed to predict the fracture-tip velocity or the fracture growth rate assuming that the fracture can be initiated when the Mode-\u2160 stress intensity is lower than the critical fracture toughness.\n16\n A recent study employed semi-circular bend tests on sandstone composed of 5% cement of argillaceous materials and investigated the effects of water- and acid erosions and found that fluid erosions in sandstone significantly influence the subcritical crack-growth process due to chemical reactions that were pertinent to the cementing agent and the grain boundaries of the sandstone.\n50\n Weak grain contacts and boundaries promote crack growth, which results in a decrease in fracture toughness and therefore in faster crack propagation. Unlike in fluid erosions in sandstone, our previous study on PG found that the influence of water saturation is insignificant and that the fracture toughness of PG is approximately proportional to BTS in both dry and fully saturated states.\n29\n\n\nIn addition, we compared the four cases in GG fractured by 6, 100, 1,600, and 6200 cycles (Fig. 8c and d and Fig. S6) and found that the high-cycle cases showed a relatively larger proportion of intergranular fractures (about 35% and 49%) compared with those in the two low-cycle cases (about 20% and 26%). We thus deduced that high-cycle fatigue had likely contributed to fracture propagation along grain boundaries.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nThe mechanism of CHF clearly differs in granite and sandstone, as is evident in the above comparison of hydraulic fracturing behavior and hydraulic fracture patterns. A few factors affect hydraulic fracture growth during cyclic injection, such as mineral content, grain size and grain interlocking, matrix permeability, dynamic fracture extension, and the design of fatigue cycles. To further interpret these influencing factors, we present schematic diagrams that explain hydraulic fracturing in coarse-grained granite versus fine-grained sandstone, as shown in Fig. 10\n.\nGrain size as well as grain shape significantly influence the hydraulic fracturing mechanism. In this study, the average grain size (d\n50) was comparable to the borehole diameter (d\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0mm) only in the two coarse-grained granites. Large grains have a size similar to the borehole diameter and are frequently observed in quartz and orthoclase compared with other minerals. Ishida et al. (2000) investigated hydraulic fracturing in four granitic rocks with different mean grain sizes (0.51\u20131.12\u00a0mm) under true triaxial stress conditions and pointed out that the dominant fracturing mechanism at grain scale shifted from tensile to shear with increasing grain size (d\/d\n50 decreases from 20 to 9).\n2\n In the present study, the confining pressure was zero, and horizontal differential stress was not considered. As a result, hydraulic fracturing was tensile dominated in all the three rocks, and BP was therefore close to the tensile strength of the rock. For the highly permeable fine-grained GS (d\/d\n50\u00a0\u2248\u00a050) with sub-rounded grain shape, because the microstructure was quite uniform and the bedding was not significant. In most cases, a bi-wing fracture was formed (Fig. 8e) while the fracture half-length was asymmetric on both sides (Fig. S3).\nFor an initially dry or partially saturated reservoir rock, fluid infiltration cannot be ignored \u2013 even in relatively low-permeable granite \u2013 because fluid leak-off in the rock matrix influences the fluid pressure built. Cyclic injection with more cycles creates a larger infiltration area, and fluid pressure in the rock matrix at a certain radial distance (r) away from the borehole can be estimated by P(r), as shown in Fig. 10a. The BP is smaller when considering the poroelastic effect compared with the prediction given by the hydraulic fracturing breakdown model assuming that the rock was impermeable.\n45\n\n,\n\n46\n In addition, the larger infiltration is beneficial for complex fracture patterns because the pre-existing defects (microcracks and natural fractures) can be activated, and tortuous fractures can be formed because the hydraulic energy is more likely to be consumed in order to break weak parts in the specimen, such as grain boundaries or fractured mineral grains. We mentioned that 20%\u201350% of intergranular fractures had been observed in the two granites, and we additionally found that most of these intergranular fractures were farther away from the borehole (at least one borehole diameter). As we explained in a previous study, the large grain size (comparable to the borehole size) does not allow for a Mode-\u2160 fracture process zone to be developed further.\n3\n As illustrated in Fig. 10a, for coarse-grained granite, tensile-dominated hydraulic fractures are formed with both intragranular and intergranular fractures. In addition, the microstructural heterogeneity in granite \u2013 particularly the presence of platy biotite grains and their orientation \u2013 enables the fracture path to be more tortuous and hydraulic fractures to deviate from the direction of maximum principal stress. This effect on hydraulic fracture tortuosity by biotite minerals is expected to be more pronounced if stress deviators come into play, such as under triaxial or true-triaxial testing. We suggest further investigating the impact of hydraulic fatigue under various confining stresses.\nIn comparison with hydraulic fractures in coarse-grained granite, tensile cracks that break cementing among sand grains are mainly formed in fine-grained sandstone, as shown by the fracture process zone and the damage zone in Fig. 10b. Unlike the tortuous fractures in heterogeneous granite, hydraulic fractures in relatively homogenous sandstone are straight and fracture branching is insignificant at the core scale. Due to its high matrix permeability, fluid leak-off is significant and the initially dry specimen can achieve a high degree of saturation after several injection cycles. Fluid pressure in the sandstone matrix far away from the borehole can achieve the same magnitude of the borehole pressure. A large number of cycles does not contribute to the degree of fluid saturation because the specimen is almost saturated in the early stages of injection with a limited number of cycles (e.g., <10); instead, long-duration injection results in cementation weakening and therefore in strength degradation. Moreover, the effects of stress corrosion can play a role when using distilled water as the fracturing fluid in quartz-rich rocks. Unlike that in the granite, tensile-strength degradation by fluid saturation in porous sandstone is dominated. We recommend investigating the mutual effects of stress deviators and stress corrosion both separately and subsequently in combined tests in order to obtain more insights into the overall complex process of hydraulic fatigue in quartz-rich geothermal-reservoir target rock, such as sandstone in particular.\nRelaxation damage control via hydraulic fatigue cycles not only seems to work in granite at the grain-scale (laboratory) but also has been demonstrated to work at mine scale and is a candidate for full scale field experiments in granitic rock.\n18\n The basic ingredients in hydraulic fatigue testing \u2013 including variable flow rates, multiple crack resting times, and more tortuous and denser fracture-network evolutions \u2013 can be seen scale independent, although the intrinsic properties of different rocks are involved at various scales.\n18\n At mine-scale, the decrease in formation breakdown pressure with number of injection cycles and a more complex fatigue fracture pattern could be confirmed in granites and granodiorite of \u00c4sp\u00f6 Hard Rock Laboratory at 410\u00a0m depth.\n24\n Three independent sources of information were used to estimate the fracture surface area: (1) impression packer results, (2) the stimulated volume via micro-seismicity observations, and (3) high precision tilt observations of the tunnel floor in the near-field of the in-situ fracturing experiment.\n18\n\n,\n\n51\n We admit that more rock types need to be investigated in future also at larger scale, and each rock type may need a tailor-made cyclic, pulse and\/or pneumatic injection treatment in order to increase the overall confidence in the hydraulic fatigue concept.\nWhen comparing the results of the two granites and the sandstone employed in this study, the effect of hydraulic fatigue is more prominent in hard rock compared to weak rock, which is in line with a recent study on cement blocks having different porosities and according low and high strength.\n52\n We see the combined design of short-term hydraulic stimulation and long-term creep-tests at different scales as minimum requirement to further refine our understanding of the mutual relationship and interrelation between the effect of high pressure cycles and stress corrosion in rock hydraulic fatigue behavior.\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe investigated the hydraulic fracturing behavior of coarse-grained Pocheon granite and Gonghe granite and fine-grained sandstone with 9% porosity via laboratory experiments that applied monotonic and cyclic water injection. Conventional and fatigue hydraulic fracture paths were analyzed via quantitative measurements from X-ray CT scanning and collages of thin section observations. Our main findings are summarized below:\n\n(1)\nThe hydraulic fracture path was significantly influenced by the composition minerals and grain size. Mode-\u2160 cracks were mainly created in all the specimens but fracture patterns were different in the two granites with large and small grain sizes. Platy biotite grains contributed to a change in fracture orientation during propagation as well as to grain-boundary fractures. The fraction of grain-boundary fractures on the total length of bi-wing hydraulic fractures was \u223c 20% in Pocheon granite and up to 49% in Gonghe granite. Quartz gains \u2013 particularly the fractured grains caused by pre-existing flaws \u2013 contributed to intragranular fractures, for example, in Pocheon granite.\n\n\n(2)\nCombined with our previous findings, this study demonstrated that a maximum of a \u223c 20% reduction in breakdown pressure can be achieved by CHF compared with monotonic HF for granite. This reduction ratio is much higher than that of tensile strength degradation via full water saturation (2.6% for Pocheon granite and 10.5% for Gonghe granite). The BP reduction (15.7%) observed during CHF was much lower compared with tensile strength degradation (42.9%) induced by water saturation in the porous sandstone.\n\n\n(3)\nCHF can potentially reduce the maximum magnitude of acoustic emissions. The average reduction was 17.5\u00a0dB, 7.5\u00a0dB, and 4.6\u00a0dB for the Gonghe granite, Pocheon granite, and gray sandstone, respectively. The reduction effect was more significant for intact granite with lower permeability. This finding supports our hypothesis that the hydraulic fatigue process is rock-type specific. Stimulation treatments in the field, in turn, should be designed to be rock-type specific.\n\n\n(4)\nCHF can produce complex fracture patterns with higher fracture tortuosity. Fracture tortuosity measured at the core scale was about 1.03\u20131.07 in the two granites, which was slightly higher than the 1.02 measured in the sandstone. Higher tortuosity created by CHF compared with HF was found in Gonghe granite that contained a large portion (13.4%) of biotite and pre-existing flaws. Hydraulic fatigue in granites was characterized by fracture branching and activation of natural pre-existing discontinuities.\n\n\n\nFinally, the effect of CHF was more pronounced in granite compared with in porous sandstone. Considering the purpose of reduction in both breakdown pressure and induced acoustic emissions, we therefore recommend further investigations into CHF behavior in less-permeable rock, such as granite and tight sandstone, and particularly into the mutual impact of stress deviator and stress-corrosion effects in quartz-rich rock.\n\n","36":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe construction of underground tunnel structures has been rapidly increasing to solve traffic congestion in urban areas.\n1\n Rocks are natural materials with heterogeneous properties and pose uncertainties when subjected to excavation, owing to varied geological properties depending on the location.\n2\u20134\n Geological hazards encountered during tunnel construction can be caused by natural factors, including ground conditions and the presence of unexpected weak zones, but also by human factors such as construction conditions and support designs,\n5\n\n,\n\n6\n with the potential for massive losses and injuries. Therefore, it is essential to understand the engineering characteristics of the target excavation site for safe and economical underground construction.\n4\n\n\nSite investigations are carried out through vertical borehole drilling to estimate the in-situ underground conditions over a wide area. However, there are limits to evaluate underground structures in detail. To solve this problem, various types of geological survey techniques, such as pilot horizontal boring and tunnel seismic prediction surveys, have been adopted to estimate the subsurface conditions ahead of the tunnel face during excavation.\n7\u201310\n However, the application of these techniques during tunnel construction requires additional steps and costs.\n11\n\n\nMeasurement while drilling (MWD) techniques have been developed for evaluating in-situ rock mass characterization for predicting the geological conditions ahead of the tunnel face.\n12\n Several studies have been conducted to investigate the geological conditions ahead of the tunnel face by pressure monitoring using a hydraulic drilling machine.\n13\u201321\n Furthermore, many researchers have carried out studies using artificial intelligence technologies, such as machine learning, to analyze the relationships among drilling datasets, and predict geological conditions,\n22\u201324\n concluding that MWD techniques are an objective and reliable method for assessing geological conditions ahead of the tunnel excavation face.\nLarge-diameter empty holes over 250\u00a0mm in diameter have been applied at the excavation face in the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) tunnel to reduce blast-induced vibrations and are generally drilled to a distance of 50\u00a0m at a time in Korea.\n25\n It is reported to be efficient in reducing blast-induced vibration through the formation of additional free faces\n26\n; however, it is time consuming because of the underdeveloped boring machines. In addition, boring operations rely on the operator's experience and not on any monitoring devices, resulting in large differences in boring quality depending on the operator's proficiency. Furthermore, it is difficult to control the boring machine in real-time in response to changes in geological conditions. Recently, a multi-setting smart-investigation of the ground and pre-large hole boring (MSP) method and machines have been developed to replace outdated existing boring machines.\n27\n\n,\n\n28\n The high-performance MSP machine drills 382\u00a0mm diameter holes, which are 20\u00a0mm larger than those drilled by the conventional machines over a shorter construction period. Kim et al.\n29\n developed a borehole alignment tracking and ground exploration system to observe the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face; however, this method has the disadvantage of increasing the construction period as it requires an additional process in which equipment must be applied after drilling is completed.\nIn this study, a real-time boring data monitoring system for the MSP machine was developed to predict the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face without requiring additional steps. This monitoring system measures the percussion pressure, rotation pressure, feed pressure used for boring work, and boring speed. To estimate the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face, the proposed monitoring system was applied to the subway construction site where drilling was performed to a depth of 40\u00a0m. In addition, a borehole alignment tracking and ground exploration system developed by the authors was used to verify the monitoring data by observing the actual geological conditions of the ground. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The characteristics of the newly proposed MSP method (a high-performance MSP machine) are introduced in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the real-time boring data monitoring system, which was newly developed for the MSP machine described, as well as a borehole alignment tracking and ground exploration system used for verification of monitoring data. Data collection through field application and data analysis are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Finally, the conclusions drawn from these analyses are presented in Section 6.\n\n\n2\nMSP method\nThe proposed method called the multi-setting smart-investigation of the ground and pre-large hole boring (MSP) method, is a cut blasting method used to minimize the blast-induced vibration in the NATM tunnel by boring a large-diameter empty hole, as shown in Fig. 1\n. The MSP machine, with a 382-mm hammer bit, generally drills to a distance of 50\u00a0m, and a depth of 10\u201360\u00a0m, depending on the requirements at the construction site. The MSP hole plays an important role in the reduction of the blast-induced vibration by releasing the confining stresses of the rock mass before blasting and the residual energy after rock breaking.\n30\n\n,\n\n31\n These MSP holes also provide larger initial spaces for moving breaking rocks through large empty holes. In general, one to three holes are used in the MSP method, and its applicability depends on the site conditions. This method is suitable for both short-and long-hole blasting as well as weak and hard rock masses, unlike the conventional cut-blasting methods such as the V-cut and cylinder cut methods.\n28\n\n\nTo drill to a total distance of 50\u00a0m, 5\u00a0m long rods are extended, and the MSP machine uses two types of pressure for boring: pneumatic pressure and hydraulic pressure. Pneumatic pressure is used for the percussion pressure, which generates the impact force in the rock by providing compressed air in the piston-type hammer bit. The hydraulic pressure is used as a rotation pressure to rotate the hammer bit in one direction and change the impact position after the first impact is completed. Furthermore, the rotation pressure is also used to discharge the crushed rock with high-pressure water by rotating the rods. This hydraulic pressure is also used as the feed pressure to maintain the hammer bit at an appropriate distance from the rock surface by advancing the main body. A variable displacement pump that provides the required hydraulic pressure was used for the feed pressure to respond automatically in real-time to geological changes within a given range. Fig. 2\n shows the field application of the MSP machine on a tunnel construction site.\n\n\n3\nMSP monitoring system for evaluating geological conditions\n\n3.1\nReal-time boring data monitoring system\nA real-time boring data monitoring system mounted on the MSP machine was developed to improve the boring efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3\n. The monitoring system comprises the working pressure monitoring part and the boring depth measurement part. The working pressure monitoring part measures the percussion, rotation, and feed pressures used in the boring works, and the wire sensor measures the total boring depth of the MSP machine. The 382-mm-diameter hammer bit was used to break the rock mass, and air pressure was provided by an industrial pneumatic air compressor. The measured data were recorded through a data logger over time, and transmitted to a self-developed software installed on the laptop and monitored in real-time. The sampling rate was set to 1 sampling\/s because the MSP method generally continues for more than 8\u00a0h. The main specifications of the monitoring devices are summarized in Table 1\n.\n\n\n3.2\nBoring alignment tracking and ground exploration system\nA deviation in both the vertical and horizontal directions of the boring alignment occurs because of the weight of the hammer bit and rods and one-directional rotation.\n27\n Furthermore, the deviation can unexpectedly increase owing to unskilled operators, machine conditions, and particular geological characteristics ahead of the excavation face. If the deviation exceeds the target position, which can be used as an empty hole in the cut area, re-construction of the MSP method is required; this leads to problems such as additional costs due to the re-entry of the boring machine and operators, thereby extending the construction period.\n\nFig. 4\n(a) shows the borehole alignment tracking and ground exploration system developed by the authors.\n29\n This system measures the drilled whole path immediately after the boring, using an inertial measurement unit sensor to check the borehole alignment and determine whether re-construction is required. In addition, the geological conditions are investigated by photographing inside the drilled hole using a machine vision camera. This system can explore the inside of the holes at a total length of 70\u00a0m, and this exploration is monitored through the MSP analysis platform (MAP) in real-time, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The MAP is an integrated platform that not only shows the measured data in real-time, but also controls the exploration system and cable drum. The exploration system was used to compare the monitored boring data and actual geological conditions acquired from the exploration system. The specifications focused on the exploration part are summarized in Table 2\n.\n\n\n\n4\nField applications\n\n4.1\nField application of the monitoring system\nThe proposed MSP method was applied to numerous tunnel construction sites in Korea to minimize blast-induced vibrations. At the same time, the real-time boring data monitoring system equipped with the MSP machine was used to estimate the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face at 10 tunnel construction sites, more than 30 times in addition to the test sites. In this study, a significant example among the several cases that the interpreted information report has provided crucial support throughout the main tunnel construction was introduced.\n\nFig. 5\n shows the original boring datasets obtained from the North Gyeongsang region in Korea. The MSP method was applied to a distance of 40\u00a0m with one hole, after consultation with the contractor, to reduce the blast-induced vibration in an area mainly composed of granitic gneiss. Fig. 5 shows the interface of the software for the boring data monitoring system, which can be used on a laptop or tablet PC. This monitoring data comprises the measured percussion pressure, rotation pressure, feed pressure, and boring depth from the top. The monitoring software displays the boring data in real-time, allowing instantaneous responses to unexpected situations during boring work by monitoring the boring process.\n\n\n4.2\nComparison of monitoring data and observed images\n\nFig. 6\n(a) shows the monitoring data focused on the first-rod data corresponding to 0\u20135\u00a0m out of a total depth of 40\u00a0m. There are four types of data, that is, rotation pressure, feed pressure, percussion pressure, and boring speed data and the boring speed was calculated from the boring depth over time. The boring data from 0 to 270\u00a0s show the pressures required to stabilize the initial planned drilling position on the rough tunnel face through manual operation. Starting at 270\u00a0s, the data show the monitoring data after the hammer bit was set in the target position and stabilized. After boring stabilization, the pressures are generally not controlled manually unless an unexpected symptom is detected. According to the monitoring data, most of the pressure data showed similar trends at a constant level; however, in section B (900\u20131050\u00a0s), the rotation pressure and boring speed increased abnormally. Although for percussion using air pressure, no particular correlation was found compared to other hydraulic pressure data. It is thought that the percussion pressure provided by the industrial compressor is immediately released after the piston operation of the hammer bit.\nTo determine the geological conditions, a borehole alignment tracking and ground exploration system was used. Images are typically extracted at intervals of 1\u00a0m from the video; however, the images in Fig. 6(b) were manually extracted for a more detailed analysis. The boring data and extracted images for section A corresponding to 1.80\u00a0m indicate general geological conditions over moderately hard rock. However, according to section B corresponding to 2.70\u00a0m, there was a fractured zone as expected in this area.\n\nFig. 7\n(a) shows the monitoring data focused on the second rod corresponding to 5\u201310\u00a0m. The data from 0 to 200\u00a0s show large variations for both rotation and feed pressures compared to other data; the data in Section C were decreased in rotation and feed pressures as opposed to the pattern in Section B in Fig. 6. It was predicted that there would be highly fractured zones in the area because manual operation for setting the hammer bit at the target position was not required after the first rod. In addition, it is assumed that there are weak zones in the area for 800\u2013900\u00a0s.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nPre-processing of the boring data\nThe MSP method is essentially accompanied by non-continuous forms of boring data, as shown in Fig. 5. This is due to the temporary interruption of boring for the extension of the 5\u00a0m rod. These irregular data forms cause difficulties in the continuous analysis of geological conditions. To continuously analyze the original data, manual pre-processing work should be carried out to convert the data to a continuous data form, which requires a considerable amount of time. Therefore, a pre-processing program that automatically connects all boring data continuously by removing the rod replacement or a work stoppage section was developed in Python. Therefore, the Pre-MSP software can significantly reduce the data pre-processing time, which greatly helps in data analysis, and Fig. 8\n shows the interface of the pre-processing program. In addition, the boring data usually accompany the noises under constant pressures; it is estimated to be the composition of the minerals of the rock or micro-cracks inside the rocks, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The pre-processing program provides two types of interpolation, fast Fourier transform and linear regression, for efficient data processing.\n\nFig. 9\n shows the entire preprocessed boring data corresponding to 0\u201340\u00a0m. This graph shows the feed pressure, rotation pressure, boring depth, and boring speed over time. In this graph, there are three remarkable sections marked in red squares that show pressure and speed data with unusual changes. In all sections, the rotation pressure and feed pressure decreased rapidly with increasing boring speed. It is presumed that these changes are due to the presence of fractured zones, which are crushed more easily than other rocks. According to the boring data analysis in Section 4, the areas corresponding to approximately 5.0\u20136.5\u00a0m, 10.0\u201311.5\u00a0m, and 15.0\u201316.5\u00a0m can be estimated to have highly fractured zones. In addition, the boring speed indicated by the length of the arrows at the top of the graph can be crucial for analyzing the conditions of the rock mass ahead of the excavation face. According to the boring speed, it is possible to estimate relatively weak zones compared to other areas.\n\n\n5.2\nAnalysis of relationship between boring parameters and geological conditions\n\nFig. 10\n depicts the three possible cases that can occur inside a hole during MSP boring, and Table 3\n summarizes several relationships derived from the boring data in Fig. 9. For the hammer bit used in the MSP machine, it is important to maintain the distance in the range of 2\u20135\u00a0cm between the hammer bit and rock surface to maximize the impact energy, as shown in Fig. 10(a). Maintaining a proper distance provides a stable boring environment; thus, pressures and boring speed are maintained at a constant level, as shown in case 1 in Table 3. However, actual boring work is carried out in unpredictable and irregular environments owing to the heterogeneous characteristics of the rock. Therefore, it is continuously faced in inappropriate boring environments as shown in Figs. 10(b) and (c). If the distance between the hammer bit and the rock becomes too small, as shown in Fig. 10(b), the feed pressure increases, and the crushing efficiency may decrease because the minimum distance is not satisfied. In addition, the excessively high feed pressure relative to the rock crushing speed causes the damage to the hammer bit, a critical component, and prolongs the construction period. Therefore, boring work is usually performed under conservative feed pressure to prevent such situations, as shown in Fig. 10(b), and data with increasing feed pressure cannot be found in the entire boring dataset. Fig. 10(c) also shows an inappropriate distance caused by low feed pressure or easily drilled fractured zones, and cases 2\u20134 in Table 3 correspond to this environment in the MSP boring process. The rotation pressures show opposite tendencies in cases 2 and 3, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. It has been reported that the rotation pressure generally decreases with increasing boring speed in weak zones.\n32\n\n,\n\n33\n On the other hand, in some cases, the rotation pressure can increase in the fractured zones with very low rock quality designation (RQD) values.\n16\n\n,\n\n34\n In the MSP boring, the rotation pressure can decrease as the overbreak zones increase owing to the presence of the fractured zones (weak zones), and also can temporarily increase as the amount of fine crushed rock (sludge) increases. Thus, it was estimated that the rotation pressure is more dependent on the degree of fragmentation of rocks encountered during boring, however, it is evident that rapid changes in the rotation pressure and boring speed are typically observed in the fractured zones. The rotation pressure data might be used only to infer the existence of the fractured zones and their intensity. Although it is difficult to determine the ground conditions ahead of the excavation face only based on the rotation pressure, more accurate analysis was possible through the combination with other boring data.\n\n\n5.3\nComparison of boring time and geological conditions\n\nFig. 11\n shows the total boring time for each rod derived from the monitored boring data. The first rod took approximately 26\u00a0min, which was longer than that taken by the other rods, to drill 5\u00a0m. As mentioned above, this is because boring was carried out slowly to properly align the target position of the hammer bit from the rough surface. In this graph, the average boring time is approximately 17.07\u00a0min except for the first rod; the maximum and minimum boring times corresponding to the fifth and seventh rods, respectively, varied by up to 1.63 times. Based on the boring time, it could be assumed that the fifth rod, corresponding to the 25\u201330\u00a0m section, is in a weak or fractured zone compared to other areas.\nBased on the total boring time for each rod in Fig. 11, hole images were extracted corresponding to the fifth and seventh rods (Fig. 12\n), which had the minimum and maximum boring times, respectively, to compare the geological conditions inside the hole. Fig. 12(a) shows the images of the fifth rod, which had the minimum boring time. As shown in Fig. 12(a), highly fractured zones were observed in this area as well as in many joint sets; thus, the boring time was significantly reduced compared to other sections. On the other hand, although there are sections from 32.40 to 33.30\u00a0m and from 34.20 to 35.10\u00a0m where the boring speed is rapidly accelerated due to fractured zones, Fig. 12(b) generally shows relatively fresh rocks compared to those in Fig. 12(a). Therefore, it is evident that the boring speed for each rod can be used for estimating the rock mass conditions for each section.\n\n\n5.4\nClassification of geological conditions using the MSP monitoring system\nThe original feed pressure, rotation pressure, percussion pressure, and boring speed data were processed using differentiation to analyze the variation over time, as shown in Fig. 13\n. The images show the differential data for each monitoring dataset as well as the original data, and negative values for each processed data were converted using absolute values. The variations in feed pressure and boring speed over time, as shown in Figs. 13(a) and (b), were observed to be relatively noticeable according to geological conditions. In addition, the feed pressure and boring speed showed a relatively high correlation in the variation over time, particularly in the highly fractured zones. Meanwhile, the variation of the rotation pressure, as shown in Fig. 13(c), showed a relatively low correlation with the geological changes compared to the feed pressure and boring speed, and it is estimated that the rotation pressure has a greater influence on the pressure required for rotation of the rods depending on the amount of crushed rocks during MSP boring. In the section where the variation of the rotation pressure is greater than 3\u00a0bar, the feed pressure and boring speed generally increase; thus, the variation in the rotation pressure only helps to estimate the geological changes, but it is difficult to establish the classification criteria in three stages. On the other hand, for the percussion pressure, as shown in Fig. 13(d), no correlation was found with the geological changes, and it is estimated that the compressive air supplied to the hammer bit is discharged immediately after being used for piston operation.\nBased on the images shown in Figs. 7 and 12, the variations in the feed pressure and boring speed over time, geological conditions were classified into three stages: fresh zones, moderately fractured zones, and highly fractured zones, as shown in Figs. 13(a) and (b). The green and orange sections represent relatively fresh and moderately fractured zones, respectively, whereas the red section appears to be a highly fractured zone. The variations in the boring speed and feed pressure rapidly increased up to approximately 0.0055 \n\nm\n\/\n\ns\n2\n\n\n, and 13\u00a0bar\/s, respectively, in the highly fractured zones, while boring data were generally maintained at approximately 0.0010 \n\nm\n\/\n\ns\n2\n\n\n, and 1\u00a0bar\/s, respectively in the relatively fresh zones. The feed pressure showed a change within the range of approximately 1\u20133\u00a0bar in the moderately fractured zones, and the boring speed showed a changes within the range of approximately 0.0015\u20130.0030 \n\nm\n\/\n\ns\n2\n\n\n in the relatively fresh zones. Based on the overall assessment of the section, it can be seen that the highly fractured zones were mainly distributed between 5 and 17\u00a0m of the site, and fresh zones and moderately fractured zones existed in the 17\u201340\u00a0m sections. Based on these relationships, it is confirmed that the MSP monitoring system can classify the geological conditions beyond the excavation face according to the changes in feed pressure and boring speed; the proposed method for geological classification ahead of the excavation face using the MSP boring data monitoring system is shown in Table 4\n.\nAs mentioned above, the proposed MSP boring data monitoring system was applied at the various tunnel construction sites more than 30 times in Korea. As a result of the continuous acquisition and analysis of the monitored data, although there were some differences in each pressure data from site to site, the variations for the pressures over time and boring speed generally showed a similar tendency for most datasets. In addition, continuous acquisition of additional data and analysis are essential to develop an advanced geological classification system that can cover various types of rock. The MSP boring data monitoring system has been continuously applied to the various road and subway tunnel construction sites to further optimize the ground classification system. Furthermore, a Python-based automatic assessment system to improve its applicability have developed based on the collected data. This integrated data acquisition and interpretation system will not only rapidly carry out the pre-processing when the obtained MSP boring data is input but also allow the automatic analysis of geological conditions by analyzing the variations of the pressures and boring speed. In addition, this system will enable reasonable geological assessment even with inexperienced engineers.\nThe finally interpreted boring data is provided to the constructor in the form of reports. The data interpretation reports contain original factual boring data (before pre-processing), processed factual boring data, as well as interpretation of the processed monitoring results, and prediction of the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face. Based on the interpretation reports about the local geology, tunnel constructors can update their design regarding blasting patterns for tunnel excavation as well as the rock supports for the main tunnel construction. This MSP boring data monitoring system has been continuously applied to each tunnel construction sites for their safety and construction management throughout the tunneling projects.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this study, a real-time boring data monitoring system, using the MSP boring machine to drill a large-diameter empty hole, was newly developed to evaluate the geological conditions ahead of the tunnel excavation face. The proposed MSP monitoring system was applied to the subway tunnel construction site to predict the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face, corresponding to a distance of 40\u00a0m. In addition, the borehole alignment tracking and ground exploration system which can observe the geological conditions inside large-diameter empty holes was used to compare the boring data and geological conditions. The main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows:\n\n\u25cf\nAccording to the analysis results of the monitored boring data and empty hole images, the feed pressure and boring speed showed a relatively high correlation as the geological conditions changed. In particular, the variation in the feed pressure and boring speed was more than 10\u00a0bar\/s, and 0.003 \n\nm\n\/\n\ns\n2\n\n\n, respectively, in the highly fractured zones. The variation in the rotation pressure could help to estimate the geological changes, but it is difficult to classify the geological conditions into three stages because the rotation pressure is more reliant on the amount of crushed rocks during boring using the rotation pressure. On the other hand, the percussion pressure was not found to be related to geological changes because the compressive air was released immediately after the piston operation of the hammer bit.\n\n\n\u25cf\nThere was a disadvantage in that the discontinuous data formed due to the rod extension work requiring pre-processing to continuously analyze the geological conditions. To address this drawback, the Pre-MSP software, which performs pre-processing of the MSP boring data, was developed to improve the efficiency of data analysis by minimizing complexity and inconvenience. This software makes it possible to predict the overall geological conditions immediately without manual pre-processing.\n\n\n\u25cf\nAccording to the monitored boring data, the boring time for each rod varied by up to 1.63 times. Comparing the geological conditions of the two zones that showed the maximum and minimum boring speeds, it was found that there were relatively large fractured zones in the section where the boring speed rapidly increased. Therefore, the MSP boring speed can be used as a basis for estimating the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face.\n\n\n\u25cf\nBased on the boring data and observed hole image data, a new classification method for estimating the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face, using the MSP boring data monitoring system, was proposed in three stages. The proposed MSP boring data monitoring system with the Pre-MSP software has great advantages in predicting the geological conditions ahead of the excavation face, without additional techniques or construction processes. In addition, if multi-MSP with two or more holes is applied to increase the vibration reduction efficiency, a more reliable and accurate prediction of geological conditions will be possible through the integrated analysis of monitoring data for several adjacent MSP holes.\n\n\n\u25cf\nHowever, continuous acquisition of additional data and analysis are essential to develop an advanced geological classification system that can integrate various types of rocks. The proposed MSP boring data monitoring system has been continuously applied to the various tunnel construction sites to develop the advanced ground classification system. Moreover, a Python-based automatic assessment system have developed by our research team to improve its applicability on the construction site. This advanced geological classification system will not only rapidly perform the pre-processing of the MSP boring data but also allow the automatic evaluation of geological conditions beyond the excavation face. In addition, this system will enable reasonable ground evaluation even for inexperienced engineers and help enhance safety and efficiency during tunnel construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nConceptualization, S.L.; Data curation, M.K.; Formal analysis, M.K.; Funding acquisition, S.L.; Investigation, M.K.; Methodology, S.L.; Project administration, S.L.; Resources, S.L.; Software, M.K.; Supervision, S.L.; Validation, M.K.; Visualization, M.K.; Roles\/Writing \u2013 original draft, M.K.; Writing \u2013 review & editing, S.L.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport [Grant 22UUTI-C157786-03].\n\n","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"\n\n1\nIntroduction and literature review\nStudies of stress in granular material have been carried out for many years due to this material's importance in many industries (i.e. Food, Pharmacy, Mining\n1\u20133\n). In block cave mining, the granular material is composed of large rock fragments within a broken column of hundreds of meters. Thus, a soil mechanics approach has been proposed to estimate stress in the caved column,\n4\u20137\n using the corrected classic Janssen approach\n8\n as an initial stress estimation. Nevertheless, the stress modelling of a broken column is more complex when different rock types, draw strategies, and complex cave geometries have to be considered.\nA common tool used to study complex granular media problems is the distinct element method (DEM;\n9\n), frequently used in stress studies (e.g:\n10\u201317\n). DEM has also been used in mining studies.\n18\u201321\n However, in cave mining studies,\n19\u201321\n the problems have been limited to a drawbell, a short column height and simplified shape fragments because of the problem of scale. As an example in Ref. 21, a draw simulation of a cylindrical model of 0.7\u00a0m height and 0.34\u00a0m diameter takes between a week and a month to complete. Other numerical tools are used for large scale problems that quickly simulate the ore flow without considering dynamic interaction between particles, such as PCBC,\n22\n CAVESIM,\n23\n FLOWSIM,\n24\n and REBOP.\n5\n\n\nStress has also been measured in the extraction level of block cave mines\n25\u201327\n with different techniques for field stress measurement such as stress cells, over-coring, the Flat Jack test, and hydraulic fracturing.\n28\n\n,\n\n29\n Rojas et al.\n25\n used stress cells in the Esmeralda mine (within the El Teniente mine) and identified the need for production pillar rehabilitation after abutment stress to provide support during ore extraction. Xia et al.\n27\n also studied the stability of the extraction level before and after undercutting in the Tongkaungyu mine using over-coring. In this mine, the stability problems mainly occurred during the undercutting, but stability problems were also reported during ore extraction. Additionally, indirect techniques have been applied. Martin et al.\n30\n proposed stress model calibration based on the drift damage and the depth of failure, while Gonzales et al.\n31\n used the damage observed in borehole cameras to model stress. In the Deep Ore Zone mine, they measured production drift convergence,\n32\n where stress concentration during ore extraction was observed. Another indirect technique was proposed by Xia et al.\n33\n to estimate stress in the extraction level through the thin plate theory.\nDuring ore extraction induced stress is, directly or indirectly, observed in the extraction level. Moreover, damage from stress has been reported in this level.\n6\n\n,\n\n34\n\n,\n\n35\n Stress measurement is useful during mining; however, it would also be useful to estimate stress in previous stages. DEM are not preferable yet for full block cave scales because of the time required for simulation. Thus, in this work we propose to incorporate a vertical stress model in a gravity flow simulator based on cellular automata (CA) that will be able to quickly model vertical stress in high draw columns under different draw scenarios.\n\n\n2\nStochastic stress model through cellular automata\nGranular media can be described by stochastic interactions\n36\n mainly due to their random shapes, sizes, contact points and contact forces.\n37\n However, this randomness follows a degree of regularity, which has allowed stochastic models of granular material flow\n36\n\n,\n\n38\u201341\n and stress in granular material\n42\u201344\n to be developed.\nIn mining, the stochastic rules used for gravity flow have been applied through Cellular Automata (CA).\n23\n\n,\n\n24\n\n,\n\n45\u201352\n Gravity flow modelling with CA is based on the void diffusion mechanism.\n53\n This mechanism has been identified in Block and Sublevel caving mines,\n54\u201359\n including in fine material fragmentation (<0.4\u00a0mm\n60\n). CA have also been used for a wide variety of complex matter in models such as rough annular shear cells, lattice-gas, lattice-grain, hybrid models, movable CA, elasto-plastic rock failure, Continuous-discontinuous CA and.\n61\u201369\n\n\nIn granular materials, the stresses are transmitted by chain forces due to the media inhomogeneity,\n42\n\n,\n\n70\n that generates stochastic stress distribution. Liu et al.\n42\n and Coppersmith et al.\n43\n proposed stress modelling in granular material by CA, through stochastic weight transmitted downward between particles, without considering the coordination number. Then, Hemmingsson et al.\n44\n applied force vectors to model the vertical forces transition reporting favorable results in silo and heap geometries of granular material.\nIn this work, we applied the weight transition through cells in a CA to simulate gravity flow in caving mines.\n47\n\n,\n\n52\n The gravity flow propagated during ore extraction was simulated using the void diffusion concept. The voids are inserted in draw points and have a probability of moving upwards and exchanging location with a non-void (granular) cell. Inversely, the weight of a (granular) cell is distributed randomly among lower cells (as shown in Fig. 1\n in 2D). The weight is distributed only over non-void cells. In Fig. 1, a cell in the i level distributed its weight, P\n\ni\n, over a lower cell in the j level. The weight is a function of the specific gravity, \n\n\n\u03b3\ni\n\n\n, and the cell volume, V. Additionally, shear forces (by friction) and horizontal forces could be considered. However, in this work only vertical force transmission was modeled. The vertical stress model was applied in a cubic lattice of cells where a cell distributed its weight over 9 lower cells (in 3D).\nThe vertical forces in the model are the weight components (by gravity) and the shear components (by friction). The shear components support part of the individual cell's weight. Here, we simplified the weight transmission introducing a buoyant parameter, E, that represents the weight fraction of a cell that is distributed to lower cells. Then, 1 \u2013 E is the cell's weight fraction that is supported by friction. The cell's weight distributed to lower cells is represented by Eq. (1).\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03b3\ni\n\n\u2212\n\u03b3\ni\n\u22c5\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\nE\n\n)\n\n=\n\u03b3\ni\n\u22c5\nE\n\nE\n=\n\n\n{\n0,1\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the weight of a cell in level j is its weight plus the weight fractions of the nine upper cells (in 3D; Eq. (2)).\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nP\nj\n\n=\n\n\u03b3\nj\n\nV\n+\nE\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n9\n\n\nP\ni\n\n\n\u03b2\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\nj\n\n\n is the weight of cell j and \u03b2i is the weight fraction of the cell i transmitted to cell j. \u03b2i is defined by the multinomial probability distribution in Eq. (3),\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n(\n\nx\nj\n\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\nn\n!\n\n\n\n\n\u220f\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\nk\n\n\nx\nj\n\n!\n\n\n\n\n\u220f\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\nk\n\n\np\nj\n\nx\nj\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere k\u00a0=\u00a0{1, \u2026,9}, x\n\nj\n\n=\u00a0d\n\nij\n is the distance between cells i and j, n is the sum of the nine distances as \n\nn\n=\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\nk\n\n\nx\nj\n\n\n, and p\n\nj\n are the initial probabilities of the nine cells defined here as an inverse function of the distance (Eq.

(4), s is a model parameter that must be calibrated. The influence of this parameter on the force distribution (\n\n\n\u03b2\ni\n\n\n) is shown in Fig. 2\n as a function of the distance between cells.\nAs can be observed in Fig. 2, the weight fraction received from upper cells decreased for larger distances between cells. The weight fraction distributed near the model boundary is omitted as was proposed by Hemmingsson et al.\n44\n because the wall friction (at the boundary) generates equal force in opposite directions. Additionally, the weight supported by nearby cells increases when s increases. Higher variability could be added to the model using a random s. However, this variability should not highly influence the mean vertical stress calculated in a level.\n\n2.1\nCell lattice influence\nThe gravity flow simulator used a cubic cell lattice (Fig. 3\nA), in which the cell weight is transmitted level by level through the Y direction applying the buoyant parameter E. Then, the cell size and the total height both influence the vertical stress transmitted to the next lower level for a specific E value. This influence is shown in Fig. 3B for a fixed height (H). There is a cumulative effect of the E parameter when the cell weight is transmitted: the total weight, P\n\nT\n, transmitted at the very bottom is decreased based on the number of cells in the vertical axis due to the parameter E.\nUsing the stress model, the weight calculated at the bottom, P\n\nV\n, can be related to the total system weight, P\n\nT\n, and to the number of cells in the vertical axis, n, as shown in Eq. (5).\n\n(5)\n\n\nP\nv\n=\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\nP\nT\n\nn\n\n\nE\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\nn\n\u2192\n\u221d\n\n\n\nP\nT\n\nl\nn\n\n(\n\n1\n\n1\n\u2212\nE\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\nP\nT\n\n\nE\nn\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nE\nn\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nStress modelling during gravity flow\nThe proposed stress model is defined for static granular material. However, as we have seen in previous studies, vertical stress increases in the stagnant zones and decreases in the movement zones when gravity flow begins due to ore extraction.\n4\n\n,\n\n5\n\n,\n\n7\n\n,\n\n19\n One reason is that the movement zones have less bulk density,\n71\u201373\n decreasing the contact points between particles for force transmission. In our stress model, we introduce a relaxation parameter, R (between 0 and 1), to model the weight distribution between the movement and stagnant zones. This parameter should depend on the rock properties and system geometry. The R parameter decreases the probability of weight distribution over the movement zone when there is a cell (or more) located in the stagnant zone (Fig. 4\n). The weight distribution of a cell, defined by Eq. (3), over a cell in the movement zone is multiplied by R to decrease the weight transmitted over this cell. The weight distribution defined by \n\n\n\u03b2\ni\n\n\n must sum 100% to avoid weight losses for this rule, assuming that P\n\n1\n\n+ P\n\n2\n\nR\u00a0=\u00a0100% (in Fig. 4 example for 2D). The weight is distributed mainly over the stagnant zones by including this R parameter.\nAdditionally, the height of the model influences E (as described in section 2.1). Thus, the movement zone height also influences E. Then, we defined E\n\nmin\n, for the buoyant parameter in the movement zone that depends on the movement zone height. Finally, the parameters R and E\n\nmin\n are used to model stress under flow conditions.\n\n\n\n3\nExperimental methodology\nFour physical models were simulated in the gravity flow simulator applying the stress model. The vertical stress measurements obtained from the physical models were then used to calibrate the parameter E in the static condition. The physical model of Castro et al.\n7\n was selected to calibrate the parameters E\n\nmin\n and R because in this model different flow scenarios were tested. Finally, the numerical model calibrated in static and dynamic conditions was compared with different flow scenarios. Python V3.7 was used in this work to build the CA stress model.\n\n3.1\nPhysical models\nThe data obtained from the physical models were used in this study to calibrate the stress model. Three of the physical models were selected because stress for block caving applications had previously been measured.\n4\n\n,\n\n7\n\n,\n\n74\n Additionally, a fourth physical model (Seditest) was used in this work to vary the effect of the wall friction and material properties.\nThe setup of the Seditest model consists of an acrylic column shown in Fig. 5\n, with a height of 50\u00a0cm and 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0cm2 square-cross section. At the bottom of the column a load sensor (Danfoss MBS 4510-060G2418) is located. A feeder is used to fill the column with the granular material (Fig. 5-B). Glass spheres and gravel were used as granular material. Additionally, three materials were used in the model walls to modify the wall roughness: paperboard, a fine sandpaper, and a coarse sandpaper.\nThe other three physical models used to calibrate the stress model are presented in Fig. 6\n. In these models, the vertical stress was measured in the base around drawpoints or over drawbells. All experiments demonstrated high variability of stress measurements. Table 1\n indicates the physical model dimensions and granular media used.\n\nTable 2\n indicates the material characteristics used in the models of Fig. 6 and the Seditest. In the Seditest, two granular materials were used: glass spheres and gravel. The gravel was previously fragmented and sieved. The real density and bulk density of the material were measured.\n75\n A simple shear test using a shear box (10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0cm2) was used to measure the undrained shear properties.\n76\n\n\nThe friction between the granular materials and the wall materials, \n\n\n\u03c6\nw\n\n\n, was measured using the tilting methodology proposed by Nedderman.\n77\n It is assumed that this value is the static friction wall angle parameter for the maximum angle before sliding. Table 3\n shows the friction wall angle obtained for the material used in the Seditest model. The friction wall angles increase as wall roughness increases for all granular materials tested as was expected. The friction wall angles were also reported to be 25\u00b0\n7\n and 19.7\u00b0\n74\n respectively. The friction angle between the wall and the material is higher than the internal friction angle of the glass spheres when coarse sandpaper is used and is also higher for gravel when fine and coarse sandpapers are used.\nIn the Seditest model, the filling time per test was 2\u00a0min. After filling the column, the vertical stress was measured for 10\u00a0min, during which no changes of vertical stress measurement were observed. A total of 6 combinations of wall and granular materials were used, each combination was repeated 3 times for a total of 18 tests.\n\n\n3.2\nStress data\nThe stress data reported in Castro,\n4\n Orellana,\n74\n Castro et al.\n7\n and Seditest are shown in Table 4\n. Here the mean vertical stress measured in the static condition (i.e. before flow) is presented.\nIn the Seditest model, the vertical stress was also measured during filling at different heights. A Janssen effect was observed in all tests. Fig. 7\n shows the results of the glass spheres and gravel for all wall materials. The vertical stress measured on glass spheres increased during filling. The effect of the wall roughness is observed between the paperboard and coarse sandpaper material wall. The results of the fine sandpaper showed a high variability; however, the mean stress values fall between the other wall materials. The gravel showed lower vertical stress than glass spheres. The gravel and glass spheres have a similar bulk density (970 and 1150\u00a0kg\/m3, respectively), but the glass spheres have lower friction wall angles, which could explain why glass spheres demonstrate higher vertical stress.\n\n\n3.3\nStress model calibration\nThe physical models presented in section 3.1 were simulated numerically to calibrate the stress model. The parameter E (Eq. (2)) was calibrated through the mean vertical stress reported whereas the parameter s (Eq. (4)) was calibrated through the standard deviation of the vertical stress reported. The mean square error was minimized to calibrate both parameters (E and s) between the vertical stress from experiments and numerical simulations, using Eq. (6).\n78\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\nm\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\ne\nx\np\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\ns\ni\nm\n\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\ne\nx\np\n\n\n\n is the experimental mean vertical stress, and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\ns\ni\nm\n\n\n\n is the simulated mean vertical stress in the CA model. Ten simulations were run per test as shown in Table 4. The cell size used is 2x2x2 cm3 in all tests except in test 1,\n4\n in which the cell size used was 10x10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 cm3. The simulation time for the static condition is less than 1\u00a0min and approximately 5\u00a0min for the draw condition (varying depending on the draw scenario).\nFirst the block model for each test is created which includes the model size and the cell properties (such as cell ID, cell state, cell density, d50). Then, the stresses are calculated in the static condition using the cell densities and equations (1)\u2013(4), in which the equations\u2019 parameters are calibrated with experimental data. In the flow condition, gravity flow is simulated first, and then the stresses are calculated as mentioned above.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nBefore flow: static calibration\n\nTable 5\n shows the experimental and simulated results, as well as the calibrated parameters E and s. Here, the parameter s was modeled using a normal distribution function (Eq. (7);\n79\n) to obtain the experimental variability of vertical stress. The parameter E increased with the height of the model (H), decreasing its effect as indicated in section 2.1.\n\n(7)\n\n\np\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n=\n\n1\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\ne\nx\np\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u2200\nx\n\u2208\nR\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this Eq. (7), \n\n\u03bc\n\n is the mean and \n\n\u03c3\n\n is the deviation, commonly denoted by N(\n\n\u03bc\n,\n\u03c3\n\n).\n\nFig. 8\n shows the results of the three models (Test 1, 2 and 3) with the calibrated parameters in static condition. The simulated vertical stress increased with depth (Y axis) under a stochastic behavior between cells. In the plan views of Fig. 8 (Plane XY), high vertical stress variability is observed as was expected from experimental results.\n\nFig. 9\n shows the numerical calibration of the Seditest. The E parameter also depends on wall friction at least for a small hydraulic radius. This effect can be observed in Fig. 10\n, where E is related to geometrical parameters (Rh and H) for gravel and ore materials, which have similar friction angles (37.9\u00b0 - 39\u00b0).\nThe parameter E increases asymptotically to 100% when Rh and H increased in the geometries modeled. In Fig. 10, the wall friction influenced E (Test 7, 8 and 9), decreasing E when the wall friction increased. The different Rh*H of the Seditest were obtained based on different granular material heights during filling.\n\n\n4.2\nDuring flow: isolated movement zone calibration\nIn this section, the parameters E\n\nmin\n and R are calibrated as described in Section 2.2. These parameters are calibrated based on Test 1 reported in Castro et al.,\n7\n where isolated extraction was simulated. The calibrated parameters are determined minimizing the error between simulated and experimental vertical stresses (Eq. (6)), using the parameter E\u00a0=\u00a098.95% previously determined. Fig. 11\n shows the physical experiment used, and the calibration of the flow zone geometry (diameter and height) simulated in the gravity flow simulator.\nThe calibrated model of vertical stresses is presented in Fig. 12\n. Here the growing of the isolated extraction zone (IMZ) can be observed due to ore extraction from the base of the model. The vertical stress decreased in the movement zone (blue ellipse). On the other hand, vertical stress concentrations are observed in the boundary of the IMZ implying more weight transmission to stagnant zones.\nThis calibration allows the evolution of E\n\nmin\n to be determined as function of the height of MZ (Fig. 13\n) of this setup. The calibrated parameter R is 0.29. Then, it is possible to evaluate the stress logic under different draw conditions using this experimental setup. In Castro et al.\n7\n different flow scenarios were reported that can be simulated with the calibrated model, E\u00a0=\u00a098.95%, R\u00a0=\u00a00.29 and E\n\nmin\n based on Fig. 13.\n\n\n\n5\nExperimental validation\nThree flow setups were simulated numerically using the stress model, applying the parameters (E, s, E\n\nmin\n and R) calibrated in Section 4. These flow experiments included a Panel Caving draw, a Block Caving draw with non-flow zone of 30\u00a0cm (spacing between drawpoints), and a Block Caving draw with a non-flow zone of 15\u00a0cm, reported in Ref. 7. In the Panel Caving draw, the granular material was extracted continuously from different drawpoints (Fig. 14\nA). In the Block Caving draw with a non-flow zone (stagnant pillar) of 30\u00a0cm, the material was drawn from side drawpoints while the central drawpoints were not extracted (Fig. 14B). In the Block Caving draw with a non-flow zone (stagnant pillar) of 15\u00a0cm, the material was also drawn from side drawpoints with a smaller non-flow zone (Fig. 14C).\nIn Fig. 14, the movement zones generated are indicated in yellow. These zones grow continuously due to ore extraction. The width of the movement zone is denoted by W\n\nZ\n. Wi is the width of the IMZ, Hi the height of the IMZ, and Wr is the stagnant pillar width. In these experiments, the vertical stresses were measured over the drawbells.\nThe simulated result of the Panel Caving scenario is presented in Fig. 15\n. Lower vertical stress is observed (blue color) in the cells located at the top of the model and in the movement zone, while higher stress concentration can be observed in the stagnant zone.\nThe mean vertical stress is compared between experimental and numerical simulations to analyze the stress model. The mean vertical stress in the numerical model was determined based on five replications per test. The vertical stress in the physical experiments was measured using load cells. The same location of the load cell was used to measure the vertical stress in the numerical model. Fig. 16\n shows the experimental and numerical results through the ratio between the vertical stress of each cell at this moment of mass draw (\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\n) and the initial vertical stress (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n0\n\n\n\n), for six load cells in the Panel Caving scenario. Here, the stress in the movement zone quickly decreased due to draw (load cells 1 and 2) in both the experimental and simulated models. Similarly, the vertical stress is decreased within the movement zone, and this is reflected when the movement zone reaches load cells 3, 4, and 5. On the other hand, the vertical stress is increased in the stagnant zone, until that zone is transformed into a movement zone. This last behavior has also been reported in DEM simulations.\n19\n,\n20\n\n\n\nFig. 17\n shows the vertical stress simulated in Block Caving scenarios with a stagnant pillar in the center. The vertical stresses in the movement zones (both sides) decreased during draw, similar to with the Panel Caving draw. On the other hand, in the stagnant zone, the vertical stress increased due to the weight transferred from the movement zones (by parameter R). This weight was transferred to the stagnant zone and continued to the bottom of the model. There are higher stress concentrations in a smaller area when a non-flow zone of 15\u00a0cm is utilized (Fig. 17B; Plane XZ: mass draw 26.9 and 36.1\u00a0kg). Then, the vertical stress in this zone decreased because the cells are reached by the movement zone (Fig. 17; mass draw 49.6\u00a0kg).\n\nFig. 18\n shows the experimental and numerical results using the ratio between the vertical stress at the moment of draw and the initial vertical stress of the Block Caving scenarios. Here, six load cells were used in the experiment with a stagnant pillar of 30\u00a0cm, while five load cells were used in the experiment with 15\u00a0cm. In the Block Caving scenario with 30\u00a0cm of non-flow zone (Fig. 18A), there are two load cells located in the stagnant zone: load cells 3 and 4. These load cells showed higher vertical stress at draw in comparison to their initial vertical stress in both the numerical and experimental models. Likewise, in the Block Caving scenario with 15\u00a0cm of non-flow zone (Fig. 18B) \u2014 with only one load cell located in the stagnant zone: load cell 3 \u2014 this load cell had higher vertical stress at draw compared with its initial vertical stress in the experiment and also in the numerical model. The simulated vertical stress in the stagnant zones of both scenarios were of a smaller magnitude than what was experimentally measured. On the other hand, the vertical stress of the movement zones of the experiments and simulations is similar, decreasing due to draw.\nThe mean errors between the experimental and simulated vertical stress are 1.53\u00a0kPa, 2.16\u00a0kPa and 5.18\u00a0kPa, respectively. These errors are assumed to be acceptable by the authors because of the natural stress variability in granular media and the experimental variability (5.58\u00a0kPa). The Block Caving draw scenario with a non-flow zone of 15\u00a0cm showed the highest error mainly due to the differences in load cell 3. In that scenario, load cell 3 did not simulate high vertical stress probably because the experiment used to calibrate the parameter R did not demonstrate stress concentration in the stagnant zone. However, the stress model can replicate vertical stress concentrations in the stagnant zones and \u2014 with even more accuracy \u2014 stress relaxation in the movement zones.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this work, a stress model is presented to simulate vertical stress in granular materials using a CA. The CA used allows gravity flow to be simulated quickly and precisely in large scale models as required by cave mining. Then, the stress in static and dynamic flow conditions can be simulated at large scale when modeled though a gravity flow simulator based on CA. The proposed stress model was calibrated with different experiments at laboratory scale in which a high level of accuracy was observed for different material media and model geometries in static conditions. The parameter E is constant for the same type of material, problem geometry and mesh selected (cell sizes). However, this parameter increased when the height of the model is increased as in cave mining during caving propagation. The stress model also simulated flow conditions through the parameters R and E\n\nmin\n. These parameters were calibrated and compared under different flow scenarios, showing good results based on the expected variability of the experimental setup used. Then, our vertical stress model with the flow simulator based on CA has the potential to be applied at block caving scale once the model parameters are defined.\n\n","51":"","52":"","53":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAn important part of the performance and safety assessment of disposal systems for radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in deep geological formations is the evaluation of the impact of the coupled effects of mechanical deformation, fluid and gas flow through the repository, and thermal loading from the decaying waste. It was recognized early on in safety and performance assessments conducted for geologic disposal sites that to be able to conduct such an evaluation, there was a need to rigorously enhance the theoretical background and to develop models capable of simulating coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes. More recently, chemical (C) processes have also been added to enable the study of fully coupled THMC processes in geosystems.\nThe term \u201ccoupled processes\u201d implies that each process potentially affects and is affected by the initiation and progress of other processes. Thus, the response of a rock mass to radioactive waste storage cannot be predicted with confidence by considering each process individually or in direct succession. In the field of rock mechanics and rock engineering, many studies have been made on two-way coupling (e.g., TM and HM), but for the repository performance problem, it is essential to study and be able to give reasonable assurance of the prediction of processes with THM coupling, and even full THMC coupling. Such coupling remains a major challenge to the science and engineering community, in part because relevant effects need to be better understood and described with constitutive relations, but also since the processes have widely different characteristic temporal and spatial scales. Coupled processes of course are not only relevant to geologic disposal of radioactive waste but also play a critical role in a range of other sub-surface engineering activities, such as carbon dioxide sequestration, enhanced geothermal systems, energy storage, as well as unconventional oil and gas production through hydraulic stimulation.\nIn 1992, recognizing the need to address the modeling challenges related to coupled THM and (in later stages) THMC processes, DECOVALEX was initiated as an international cooperative project of nuclear waste organizations, including implementers, regulators, and research institutions, plus a large number of associated research and modeling teams, providing a wide range of perspectives and solutions to these complex problems (www.decovalex.org). Analysis and comparative modeling of state-of-the-art field and laboratory experiments has been at the core of the collaborative work, with an increasing focus on characterizing uncertainty and blind prediction of experimental results. Since 1992, the project has gone through several four-year phases, each phase featuring a number of selected modeling challenges of importance to radioactive waste disposal. Six project phases were successfully concluded between 1992 and 2015, results of which have been summarized in several overview publications (e.g. Refs.\n1\u20133\n) and in a series of Special Issues in the International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences (Vol. 32(5) in 1995, Vol. 38(1) in 2001, and Vol. 42(5\u20136) in 2005), in the Journal of Environmental Geology (Vol. 57(6) in 2009), and in the Journal of Environmental Earth Sciences (Virtual Topical Collection, 2016).\nThe 7th phase of the DECOVALEX project, here referred to as DECOVALEX-2019, comprised of modeling teams from 13 international partner organizations, which participated in the comparative evaluation of seven modeling tasks (i.e., Tasks A through G). Together, these tasks address a wide range of relevant issues related to engineered and natural system behavior in a variety of potential host rocks. The 29 publications in this Virtual Special Issue provide an in-depth overview of the collaborative research efforts conducted in each task and how these have advanced the state-of-the-art of understanding and modeling coupled THMC processes. Below, we briefly introduce each task, provide references to respective publications, and explore some common lessons learned that have emerged across the tasks. One of the most important characteristics of DECOVALEX is the emphasis on a cooperative research environment and the desire to gain insight by comparative analysis of multiple alternative approaches. This characteristic is reflected in this Virtual Special Issue by jointly authored synthesis papers for each task. These provide an overview of the modeling approaches pursued by individual research teams and discuss which concepts and models have been particularly suited for a given coupled problem. The synthesis papers are supplemented by more detailed publications describing the research methods and findings of individual teams.\n\n\n2\nDECOVALEX-2019 tasks\nThe seven DECOVALEX-2019 tasks can be grouped into the four following general themes:\n\n-\nNovel Representations of Micro-Scale Processes (Tasks A and F)\n\n\n-\nTHM Processes in Clay-Based Materials (Tasks D and E)\n\n\n-\nModeling Coupled Processes in Complex Fracture Networks (Tasks C and G)\n\n\n-\nComplex Hydro-Mechanics with Relevance for Broader Subsurface Engineering Applications (Task B)\n\n\n\nThe tasks under each theme are discussed below.\n\n2.1\nNovel representations of micro-scale processes\n\n2.1.1\nTask A: ENGINEER - modeling advective gas flow in low permeability sealing materials\nThe purpose of Task A was to better understand the processes governing gas migration in low permeability clay-based barrier materials (Fig. 1\n). Special attention was given to the fundamental mechanisms and controlling factors for gas migration, such as gas entry and flow, or pathway stability and sealing, which will affect barrier performance. The modeling task utilized a series of well-instrumented small-scale laboratory experiments that were conducted by the British Geological Survey (BGS). Task participants tested new model concepts in comparison to a variety of tests that were conducted under different conditions and dimensionalities, including 1D and pseudo-spherical gas flow at constant volume and constant stress. Eight international modeling teams participated in ENGINEER using four types of modeling approaches: (i) standard two-phase flow models incorporating a range of different mechanical deformation behaviors, (ii) enhanced two-phase flow models in which fractures are embedded within a plastic material (continuous techniques) or incorporated into the model using a rigid-body-spring network (discrete approaches), (iii) a single-phase model incorporating a creep damage function in which only gas flow is considered, and (iv) a conceptual approach used to examine the chaotic nature of gas flow. A summary of the collaborative research work conducted in this DECOVALEX task is given in the synthesis paper by Tamayo-Mas et al.\n4\n Detailed results from individual modeling groups can be found in Chittenden et al.\n5\n; Dagher et al.\n6\n, Damians et al.\n7\n; Kim et al.\n8\n; and Harrington et al.\n9\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2\nTask F: FINITO - fluid inclusion and movement in the tight rock\nThe purpose of this modeling task was to refine and compare modeling approaches for the behavior of fluid inclusions in tight low-permeability rock (Fig. 2\n). Fluid inclusions may be found within mineral crystals or along grain boundaries in evaporitic formations as well as in many sedimentary rocks and can migrate in the presence of thermal or hydro-mechanical gradients. For the disposal of radioactive waste, common host rock candidates such as clay and salt rock are considered tight with respect to fluid movement and such fluid inclusions are typically stagnant. However, they may become mobilized by a perturbation of the in situ state, which can occur due to excavation and other geotechnical installations, the emplacement of heat-generating waste, or the generation of gas pressure. The migration of fluid inclusions can have important impacts on the long-term performance of a geologic repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Task F was designed to investigate two aspects of fluid inclusion migration in rock salt under different boundary conditions: (a) altered hydro-mechanical conditions as a consequence of tunnel excavation or borehole drilling and (b) coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical conditions during the heating period in the post-closure phase of a repository. The three teams involved in this task collaborated to improve process understanding and model concept development. Aspects of the research work conducted in Task F are given in Shao et al.\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nTHM processes in clay-based materials\n\n2.2.1\nTask D: INBEB - hydro-mechanical (HM) and THM Interactions in Bentonite Engineered Barriers\nThe objective of INBEB (Interactions in Bentonite Engineered Barriers) was the interpretation and modeling of the performance of an initially inhomogeneous bentonite barrier, based on data from two full-scale long-term experiments. These are the isothermal Engineered Barrier (EB) experiment (Fig. 3\n), which ran for over ten years at the Mont Terri URL, and the non-isothermal FEBEX heater test, which was in operation for more than 18 years at the Grimsel Test Site. In both cases, a comprehensive post-experiment dismantling and characterization effort provided uniquely detailed three-dimensional information of the bentonite barrier properties at the end of each test. INBEB assessed the evolution from a newly installed unsaturated engineered system to a fully functioning barrier, using HM and THM model predictions in comparison to the experimental data. Special attention was paid to the evolution of barrier heterogeneity under transient conditions and on the final state reached upon saturation. This requires improved constitutive relationships to describe material behavior and properties in hydrating bentonite, an enhanced understanding of the fundamental processes that lead to barrier homogenization, and improved capabilities for modeling coupled HM and THM processes in complex geo-materials. Four international research teams participated in INBEB. In general, the numerical models were able to represent adequately the trends in the observed TH and THM behavior modelled. A summary of the collaborative research work conducted in this task is given in the synthesis paper of Gens et al.\n13\n Further details from individual teams are given in Lee et al.\n14\n; Takayama\n15\n; and Michalec.\n16\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2\nTask E: upscaling of heater test modeling results\nThe purpose of this modeling task was to evaluate upscaling approaches for THM modeling in the Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) claystone host rock, starting with small size experiments (some cubic meters) to real scale emplacement cells (some ten cubic meters) all the way to scale of a waste repository (cubic kilometers). To achieve this aim, Task E utilized data from in-situ heating experiments performed by Andra (the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency) in the Meuse\/Haute-Marne Underground Research Laboratory (MHM URL). The repository design developed by Andra assumes that waste canisters are placed horizontally in parallel micro-tunnels drilled from access drifts. A comprehensive research program was conducted in the Meuse\/Haute-Marne URL near Bure to investigate the THM response of the COx to thermal loading from these microtunnels, through laboratory and in-situ experiments. The in-situ experimental program consists of a step-by-step approach ranging from small-scale heating boreholes (TED experiment) to a full-scale experiment of a single emplacement tunnel (ALC experiment - Fig. 4\n). Task E started with modeling of the TED experiment to derive THM parameters by means of a calibration exercise and then used these parameters for a blind prediction of the ALC experiment. As a final modeling step, the models tested against the ALC data were extrapolated to a model for the entire repository with multiple emplacement tunnels. Five teams participated in Task E. A summary of the collaborative research work conducted in this Task is given in two synthesis papers, the first by Seyedi et al.\n17\n on upscaling from the TED to the ALC heater tests, the second by Plua et al.\n18\n on intercomparison of approaches to model the entire repository. Additional information on individual modeling efforts is given in Plua et al.\n19\n; Bumbieler et al.\n20\n; Guo et al.\n21\u201323\n; Wang et al.\n24\n\n,\n\n25\n; Thatcher et al.\n26,27\n; Xu et al.\n28\n; and Yu et al.\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\nModeling coupled processes in complex fracture networks\n\n2.3.1\nTask C: GREET - modeling hydro-mechanical-chemical-biological processes during groundwater recovery in crystalline rock\nTask C centered on the GREET test, a full-scale experiment recently conducted in the Japanese Mizunami URL (crystalline rock) to evaluate the natural resaturation of the near-field environment of a geologic repository after repository closure (Fig. 5\n). GREET stands for Groundwater REcovery Experiment in a Tunnel. The goals of GREET were as follows: (1) to understand the water recovery processes and mechanisms of the near-field fractured rock, (2) to verify coupled hydrological-mechanical and chemical simulation methods for modeling these processes, and (3) to develop monitoring techniques for the facility closure phase and appropriate closure methods taking recovery processes into account. The primary features of interest to be modelled in Task C were the water pressure drawdown and recovery, and the variation of water chemistry during the tunnel excavation and closure, as observed in the monitoring boreholes and the closure test drift (CTD) itself. Three modeling teams used a range of deterministic and stochastic approaches to represent how high-permeability fracture pathways near the tunnel impact groundwater recovery and water chemistry. Onoe et al.\n30\n and Hokr & Balvin\n31\n describe modeling activities conducted for DECOVALEX Task C.\n\n\n2.3.2\nTask G: EDZ evolution: reliability, feasibility, and significance of measurements of conductivity and transmissivity of the rock mass\nThe formation and evolution of the excavation disturbed and excavation damage zone (EDZ) around deposition tunnels and holes is an important topic in the development of radioactive waste disposal concepts. In crystalline host rock, the formation of an EDZ will increase the transmissivity of the rock mass in the vicinity of the excavations and thus raise the potential for fluid migration parallel to the excavations. Task G was primarily concerned with modeling the evolution of EDZ transmissivity throughout the lifetime of a repository from construction to pre-closure and post-closure phases. A secondary focus was on the challenges and uncertainties for monitoring rock mass permeability as a function of time during construction and operation of a repository hosted in fractured crystalline rock. The task was based on detailed EDZ transmissivity tests performed in the TAS04 tunnel in the \u00c4sp\u00f6 Hard Rock Laboratory in Sweden (Fig. 6\n). A summary of the collaborative research work conducted in this DECOVALEX task is given in Meier and Backers\n32\n and modeling of fracture transmissivity changes in response to excavation, thermoshearing, and glaciation is presented in Kwon and Min\n33\n.\n\n\n\n2.4\nComplex hydro-mechanics with relevance for broader subsurface engineering applications\n\n2.4.1\nTask B: modeling the induced slip of a fault in argillaceous rock\nThis modeling task evaluated the conditions for slip activation and stability of faults in clay formations, with focus on the complex coupling between fault slip, pore pressure, permeability creation, and fluid migration. This subject is of great importance to many subsurface applications where injection of fluids leads to pore-pressure increase and reduction of effective normal stress on faults, which in turn can cause fault reactivation. Regarding radioactive waste emplacement, increases in pore pressure could be due to release of heat from the high-level waste or the generation of gas due to metal corrosion. The possibility of an increased permeability caused by fault slip is of concern for the long-term safety of a repository. The central element of this Task B was the FS Fault Slip Experiment conducted in the Mont Terri Underground Research Laboratory in Switzerland, which utilized a novel experimental setup for controlled fault slip testing in a realistic underground setting at field scale (Fig. 7\n). Six modeling teams participated in this task, using both interface approaches or solid finite elements to account for the fault discontinuity. In general, the hydromechanical behavior of the fault as observed in the field was captured best as a propagating rupture along an existing weakness plane with damage-enhanced permeability. A summary of the collaborative research work conducted in this DECOVALEX task is given in the synthesis paper by Rutqvist et al.\n35\n; with further details provided in Park et al.\n36\n and Shiu et al.\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nMain achievements and remaining challenges\nDECOVALEX-2019 successfully explored some common themes across a range of complex modeling tasks (see further discussion of themes below), yielding new insights but also encountering common issues that remain to be resolved. Significant progress was achieved by research teams of all tasks. Modeling teams adopted advanced modeling approaches using different numerical methods and computer codes and were generally able to achieve good agreement, both compared to the experimental observations and compared to other teams using alternative modeling approaches. In cases where differences remain, task leads and modeling teams made efforts to isolate the reasons for them and discussed what could be done to improve. Overall, the achievements and outstanding issues obtained from the seven tasks form an important step forward for better understanding of the scientific\/technical issues of importance for safe geological disposal of radioactive wastes in different host rocks, with complex geological conditions and increasing environmental challenges.\n\n3.1\nNovel representations of micro-scale processes\nBoth Tasks A and F both dealt with fundamental challenges in understanding and modeling the highly non-linear fluid migration observed in very low permeability formations. Observed experimental and field behaviors are often strongly stochastic and therefore it can be very difficult to rationalize the core physical behavior (i.e., identify what experimental features are reproducible under different circumstances) and successfully interpret the experiments. In addition, the experimental setup can be very important in determining the result, hence careful representation of the experiment (e.g., explicit representation of the injector apparatus used in the laboratory experiments in Task A) can be key to building a successful model. In this context, the DECOVALEX working model of close integration between experiment and modeling is an important one. In Task A, the primary concern was the migration of pressurized gas in compacted bentonite, while Task F mainly considered migration of inclusions in salt formations. While superficially quite distinct, there are a number of commonalities. For Task A, it was shown that conventional two-phase flow approaches are largely inadequate to represent the observed behavior, taking into account all the known features of the experimental results (e.g., very low gas saturations at breakthrough). Hence the inclusion of implicit or explicit features to represent the dilation process is essential. Similarly, for Task F, explicit treatment of fluid migration along the halite grain boundaries, also by a dilation process under strongly deviatoric stress conditions, was found to be a good representation of salt inclusion migration. Both tasks illustrated the importance of micro-scale control on macro-scale phenomena and novel approaches for bringing the micro-scale understanding into the meso- and macro-scale have been put forward.\n\n\n3.2\nTHM processes in clay-based materials\nTasks D and E considered HM and THM processes in clays or clay-based materials such as bentonite or clay, at the waste disposal scale. Task E demonstrated that good blind predictions of pore-pressure and temperature can be obtained for heat-generating disposal analogs using thermal diffusion models with conventional elastic poro-mechanics. There was some evidence of surprising local heterogeneity in the clay at the MHM URL which meant some recalibration was required when moving between experiments, illustrating the potential impact of variability and heterogeneity on pore pressure. The teams were also able to upscale their models to represent the whole repository, and use these models to investigate the sensitivity of uncertainty and variability on key metrics (pore pressure and implied effective stress) that could impact the safety case. In understanding the details of the experiments, it was clear that the development of the EDZ, and the resulting effective hydraulic and mechanical properties of the EDZ, were important to calibrate the models to the observations. While the task demonstrated a generally good representation of scale-dependent THM processes, the treatment of mechanical damage and the resulting change in the clay properties remain areas of significant uncertainty. Task D focused on compacted and pelleted bentonite used as a clay-based buffer material. While teams were also able to obtain good agreement with the measured thermal and hydraulic responses, a complete representation of the plastic deformation \u2013 in this case focused on the homogenization of the bentonite during heating and resaturation \u2013 remained challenging. Hence both tasks encountered similar issues in terms of the treatment of the plasticity of clays, albeit from different perspectives (homogenization in Task D, induced damage in Task E). These issues with damage\/plasticity represent the major uncertainties in the work to date and hence areas for future investigation to improve the robustness of understanding.\n\n\n3.3\nModeling coupled processes in complex fracture networks\nTasks C and G both dealt with the problem of interpreting groundwater flows and (in the case of Task C) transport within discrete fracture networks (DFNs) in crystalline host rock. This is an area of long-standing study within DECOVALEX and the tasks have encountered many of same issues, albeit from a different perspective. Both tasks illustrated that realistic DFN models, based on geological observation, can successfully represent net tunnel inflows after some calibration. Some teams were also successful when using an equivalent continuum porous medium (EPCM) approach rather than a DFN model. However, both tasks ran into modeling challenges when looking at more complex aspects of the problem. In the case of Task C, successfully modeling the wide range of observed chloride concentrations in the tunnel was particularly problematic. Producing a convincing representation of the transport required manual intervention in the DFN\/EPCM to connect the excavated tunnel to vertically distant higher and lower concentrations of chloride. Task G showed a similar issue at a much smaller scale, whereby the interference tests in the TAS04 experiment were very hard to interpret and model when using intersections of planar fracture surfaces identified in the EDZ. Both tasks concluded that channelization with the fracture network could be the cause of the difficulties in modeling the observations, noting that large scale heterogeneities in the DFN network for Task C could also be a factor.\n\n\n3.4\nComplex hydro-mechanics with relevance for broader subsurface engineering applications\nTask B focused on an individual fault zone in a low-permeability claystone rather than DFN systems in a crystalline potential host rock as discussed above. Modeling teams addressed numerical challenges associated with fluid injection and reactivation in a fault system with a complex structure comprising of a strongly foliated fault core enveloped by a fractured damage zone. The task used data from a highly instrumented in situ test which provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between pressure buildup, fault opening, fault slip, and fluid migration. The collaborative modeling work in Task B clearly illustrated the numerical complexities of simulating complex discontinuous features experiencing normal and shear displacement under hydraulic control. Different numerical methods were found to have contrasting strengths and weaknesses in representing the highly non-linear nature of the hydro-mechanical response. Extensive work on an initial benchmarking exercise provided coherence between the modeling tools and gave good confidence that the basic couplings were being represented properly. However, large differences were seen between modeling approaches in more complex cases where plastic damage on shear features is suspected to play an important role. This has parallels with the DFN work where the presence of stochasticity is important. Task B is of interest outside of the radioactive waste management arena, being of direct relevance to other sub-surface engineering applications (e.g., geologic carbon sequestration, geothermal energy, underground energy storage, etc.).\n\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nThe results of the collaborative modeling in DECOVALEX-2019 have produced some clear outcomes and common issues across a diverse portfolio of complex modeling task. There have been considerable successes in moving forward the science of predicting coupled processes in geological materials, but there remain non-trivial issues that are of direct relevance to a wide range of geo-engineering applications.\nThe work has shown that true blind predictions remain one of the best methods of building confidence in modeling approaches. Success has been had in low permeability systems predicting THM responses. However, it is necessary to consider the input uncertainty when making predictions, especially if outcomes of interest are broadly linear (e.g., pressure response) whereas the key uncertainties and log-normally distributed (e.g., intrinsic permeability). Significant progress has also made in modeling advective movement of gas in clays, with a range of 1D\/2D\/3D models being used successfully to give a reasonable representation of the experimental observations. It is clear from this work that a conventional continuum multi-phase flow representation of gas migration is not an appropriate method; rather alternative approaches or major augmentations of existing methods are required to produce physically plausible models. This is an area of ongoing research which is being continued in the ongoing DECOVALEX-2023 Project phase.\nScience challenges around stochasticity were felt in several tasks. The time-series stochastic features in some experimental observations cause considerable difficulties in attempting to represent the experiment using essentially deterministic models. While it can be argued that a stochastic system should be modelled using a stochastic model, when only single or small numbers of experiments are available, modelers are effectively forced to use deterministic representations to understand the fundamental processes, with the treatment of the observed stochasticity a future research area. Some success was achieved using chaotic representations to understand such data, but these methods are very much in their infancy. A few modeling teams also tackled the reverse problem where stochastic models were used to condition against deterministic data for fractured rock representations. From this work there was clear evidence that details of flow and transport are not well represented using parallel plate square or circular fractures; channels or pipes appear necessary to explain experimental observations.\nThe representation of HM processes in large fracture systems was generally successful, but there was a heavy divergence in results dependent on the details of the numerical method used. This makes application of these models in a predictive mode difficult and the results subject to considerable uncertainty. In addition, the representation of plasticity and damage in clay rocks remains a key uncertainty and is difficult to model as an emergent phenomenon.\nWe hope that the brief summary presented above, and the in-depth research findings in the selected papers, provide an idea of the breadth and depth of cutting-edge research work carried out within the DECOVALEX-2019 project. With this Virtual Special Issue, we also intend to convey to interested readers the value of the DECOVALEX philosophy of cooperation between international researchers of different disciplines using a range of different approaches. Such collaboration means frequent interactions, sharing of data and results, collectively generating new ideas and concepts, raising technical issues in joint communications, and performing critical reviews of each other's work. The insight obtained in such integrated cooperative efforts would have been impossible if the teams had worked independently. Comparison of model results with other international modeling groups, using their own simulation tools and conceptual understanding, enhances confidence in the robustness of predictive models used for performance assessment. In addition, the possibility of linking model differences to particular choices in conceptual model setup provides valuable guidance into \u201cbest\u201d modeling choices and understanding the effect of conceptual models on predictions.\n\n","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nRockbursts often occur in deep underground mines and deep tunnels where the in situ rock stresses are high. This phenomenon causes significant risk in subsurface operations and could potentially lead to personnel casualties, equipment damage, and delay of excavation operations. Systematic studies of rockburst behavior were carried out in Canada and South Africa as early as the 1940s and 1950s.\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n In particular, Ortlepp\n3\n visited many rockburst sites in South Africa's underground mines and documented the events in thousands of photographs, some of which have been compiled and published in a book. Over the past 30 years, great attention has been paid to rockbursts in other regions too, such as Canada and China, where mining and rock excavation are widely undertaken at great depth. A comprehensive five-year research program on rockburst in hard rock mines was carried out in the 1990s in Canada.\n4\n The program includes mechanics of rockburst, rockburst support handbook, mine seismicity and numerical modelling. In the past decade, numerous rockburst events have been reported in excavations of road, railway, and headrace tunnels in China (e.g., Shan and Yan,\n5\n Gong et al.,\n6\n Feng et al.,\n7\n Xu et al.\n8\n).\nRockbursts are classified into two categories \u2014 strain burst and fault-slip rockburst \u2014 in accordance with the major contributors of kinetic energy in the burst events. In a strain burst event, the kinetic energy for the burst is mainly converted from strain energy released from the rock mass. A strain burst may be triggered by the elevated tangential stress immediately following the excavation, thus being called a self-initiated strain burst,\n9\n or by a fault-slip seismicity event, which is thus called a fault-slip triggered strain burst in this paper. In some cases, the fault-slip seismicity is so powerful that it contributes the major portion of the burst energy in a burst event. Such a burst is called fault-slip triggered rockburst in this paper. The difference between the fault-slip triggered strain burst and the fault-slip triggered rockburst is that the fault-slip seismicity only triggers the burst event in the former, whiles it both triggers and contribute the major portion of the burst energy in the latter. Numerous studies have been carried out in the physical simulation of strain burst in the laboratory (e.g. He et al.,\n10\n Su et al.\n11\n) and also in the theory of energy conversion during strain bursting.\n12\u201319\n A substantial understanding of strain burst behavior has been gained through those studies as well as field observations, however, there are still outstanding issues that need to be clarified in the mechanics of strain burst. Two such issues are where the kinetic energy of a strain burst comes from and how the energy contribution from the surrounding rock mass varies with increasing burst depth. Limited studies have been carried out on these topics, such as by Kaiser,\n20\n however, more comprehensive studies are required to gain insights into the detailed mechanics of strain bursting.\nThe study presented in this paper focuses on the energy sources in a strain burst event and the energy conversion during bursting, with an emphasis on the role of the surrounding rock mass. In this research, the characteristics of a strain burst event are first presented based on field observations. Two conceptual models are then proposed to illustrate the energy sources and conversions involved in a rockburst event. A hypothesis is proposed that the magnitude of a strain burst is increasingly associated with the energy released from the surrounding rock mass with increasing burst depth and volume. This hypothesis is verified both numerically and analytically in the paper.\n\n\n2\nStrain burst\nStress concentration is a prerequisite for strain burst. The tangential stress is elevated in the contour rock after excavation (Fig. 1\na); the rock then fails when the tangential stress exceeds the strength of the rock. The elastic strain energy stored in the failed rock and a certain amount of strain energy released from the surrounding rock mass, called the total potential strain energy, are dissipated mainly by rock fracture and rock ejection during bursting.\n12\n A negligible amount of the energy is conversed to heat and vibration. In hard rock, the rock fracture may not be able to dissipate the entire potential strain energy and a portion of it is transformed to kinetic energy to eject the rock, which lead to the occurrence of a strain burst event. In some cases, the tangential stresses in the rock are elevated to such high levels that strain bursts occur instantly after excavation or a short time thereafter (Fig. 1b). The former behavior is called instant strain burst and the latter delayed strain burst, based on the time of burst occurrence.\n21\u201324\n From the point of view of the triggering mechanism, both types belong to the self-initiated strain burst class because they are triggered by the static stress concentration after excavation.\n9\n\n,\n\n20\n In other cases, the static stress concentration in the rock is insufficient to induce rock failure, so the rock is still intact after excavation. The arrival of seismic waves generated by fault slippage could elevate the tangential stress to the level of the rock strength so that a burst event is triggered. In this scenario, the seismic waves could also contribute extra energy for rock fragmentation and ejection, in addition to elevating the tangential stress. This type of burst is referred to as fault-slip triggered strain burst in this paper (Fig. 1c). The magnitude of a fault-slip triggered strain burst may vary within a large range depending on the amount of energy contributed by the seismic waves. Therefore, the magnitude of a fault-slip triggered strain burst may be similar to that of a self-initiated strain burst when the event is triggered by weak seismic waves (e.g. caused by a distant fault slippage), however, it could be much stronger if strong seismic waves (e.g. caused by a powerful fault slippage nearby) contribute a considerable amount of energy to the burst rock. Hereby burst rock refers to the rock that is ejected after bursting, while the surrounding rock is the rock immediately beside the ejected rock. The burst rock falls after busting, whiles the surrounding rock remains where it is but displaces somewhat.\nA characteristic of both self-initiated and fault-slip triggered strain bursts is that the rock is intact before bursting. In a powerful self-initiated strain burst event, the rock is usually fractured into thin, knife-sharp slices, as shown in Fig. 2\na, which illustrates the rock pile after an instantaneous self-initiated strain burst in a mine stope at a depth of approximately 1000\u00a0m in quartzite. In a fault-slip triggered strain burst event, the rock debris may be finely fragmented, as shown in Fig. 2b, which shows a rock pile after a strong fault-slip triggered strain burst event in a crosscut of an iron ore mine at a depth of approximately 1100\u00a0m. The fine fragmentation of the rock might result from a large amount of energy input from the seismicity in addition to the elastic strain energy released from the rock. In terms of their positioning, strain bursts often occur in the roof of mine drifts but may also occur on the excavation face and walls.\n25\n\n\n\n\n3\nEnergy sources and energy conversions\nEnergy release and energy conversion are both involved during a rock burst event. Li\n26\n proposed a ball-cliff conceptual model to illustrate the energy sources and their conversions in a burst event, as shown in Fig. 3\n. In the model, the ball represents the burst rock, the cliff edge is the critical stress state for rock failure, i.e., the rock strength, and the cliff height represents the potential strain energy for rock fracture and rock ejection, denoted as W\n\ne\n. In this model, the ball is located on the clifftop and to the left side of the cliff edge when the tangential stress in the contour rock is lower than the rock strength \u2014 this represents a stable condition without rock failure and bursting. The ball is thrown to the right and over the cliff edge when the tangential stress exceeds the rock strength. The total potential energy for frock fracture and rock ejection is (W\n\ne\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\ns\n), where W\n\ns\n is the seismic energy input to the burst rock. The amount of the seismic energy W\n\ns\n depends on the scale of the causal fault-slip event. It is zero in the case of a self-initiated strain burst, but it may be significantly high in a fault-slip triggered strain burst.\nDuring rock bursting, the total potential energy (W\n\ne\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\ns\n) is dissipated by rock fracture (W\n\nf\n), converted to kinetic energy for rock ejection (W\n\nk\n), and converted to a small amount of energy for heat and vibration. Neglecting the portion to heat and vibration, the energy conversions are illustrated in a model constructed using the load-displacement curve of the burst rock and the response line of the surrounding rock mass, as shown in Fig. 4\n. In this model, line OA represents the behavior of the rock during loading in the pre-peak stage. Point A is the ultimate load level of the rock, that is, the rock strength. Laboratory tests, such as by Gong et al.,\n27\n\n,\n\n28\n Xie et al.,\n29\n\n,\n\n30\n Meng et al.,\n31\n Ai et al.\n32\n and Yong et al.,\n33\n have demonstrated that a small amount of energy is dissipated by microscopic rock damage in the pre-peak loading stage. That portion of energy for rock damage is usually quite small in hard rock compared with the entire energy stored in the rock. That rock damage energy, denoted as W\n\nd\n, is represented by the hatched area bounded by the loading line OA and the unloading line AB in Fig. 4. The elastic strain energy stored in the rock prior to bursting is represented by the area bounded by BACB, denoted as W\n\nb\n = (W\n\nbf\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nbk\n). A portion of W\n\nb\n is dissipated by rock fracture, denoted as W\n\nbf\n, and the remainder is converted into kinetic energy to eject rock, denoted as W\n\nbk\n in the post-peak failure stage. The thick declining line AD is the response of the surrounding rock mass during rock bursting. The slope of the line represents the overall stiffness of the surrounding rock mass in the vicinity of the bursting place. The strain energy released from the surrounding rock mass is represented by the area bounded by ADCA, denoted as W\n\nm\n = (W\n\nmf\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nmk\n), where W\n\nmf\n is the portion dissipated by rock fracture and W\n\nmk\n the portion converted into kinetic energy. Overall, the total strain energy available for rock fracture and rock ejection in the post-peak stage, denoted as W\n\ne\n, is the sum of the elastic strain energy stored in the burst rock, W\n\nb\n, and the energy released from the surrounding rock mass, W\n\nm\n, that is, W\n\ne\n = (W\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nm\n). In addition to the aforementioned elastic strain energy sources in the rock, the seismic energy input W\n\ns\n is also partially dissipated by rock fracture (W\n\nsf\n) and partially converted to kinetic energy (W\n\nsk\n). Considering the terms defined above, the overall kinetic energy for rock ejection, denoted as W\n\nk\n, comes from the burst rock (W\n\nbk\n), the surrounding rock mass (W\n\nmk\n), and the seismic waves (W\n\nsk\n), that is, W\nk\n = (W\n\nbk\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nmk\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nsk\n). The kinetic energy contributed by the burst rock itself, W\n\nbk\n, depends on the rock type and is a constant per unit volume for a given lithology. The W\n\nbk\n may be affected by the length-to-diameter ratio of the rock specimen in the laboratory test. However, such kinetic energy is indeed released from the burst rock itself so that it is called the intrinsic burst energy of the rock.\n34\n The kinetic energy contributed by the surrounding rock mass, W\n\nmk\n, is associated with the stiffness of the surrounding rock mass. Analogously to the components of the kinetic energy, the energy dissipated by rock fracture, denoted as W\n\nf\n, is also the sum of three components, that is, W\n\nf\n = (W\n\nbf\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nmf\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nsf\n).\nTwo prerequisites must be satisfied for a strain burst event to occur: first, the tangential stress in the rock must reach the level of the rock strength, and second, there must be excess energy to eject rock after rock failure, that is, W\n\nk\n\u00a0>\u00a00.\nA burst pit is formed in the contour of the underground opening accompanying a strain burst event. Let us assume that the thin dotted line in Fig. 5\n marks the boundary of the rock to be ejected in a section crossing the potential burst pit in the 3D space. The resultant stress vector on a differential area dA of the potential burst boundary is \n\n\np\n\u2192\n\n\n before the burst. The differential boundary area moves from the position of the dotted line to the solid line with a displacement vector \n\n\n\u03b4\n\u2192\n\n\n after the burst occurs and, simultaneously, the stress on the boundary drops to zero. During this process, the work done by the rock mass to the ejected rock is equal to the energy released from the surrounding rock mass, W\n\nm\n, along the burst boundary. This is equal to the integral of the differential work \n\n\n(\n\n\np\n\u2192\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u03b4\n\u2192\n\n\n)\n\nd\nA\n\n over the burst boundary in the 3D space, that is:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nW\nm\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n0\nA\n\n\n(\n\n\np\n\u2192\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u03b4\n\u2192\n\n\n)\n\nd\nA\n\n\n\nwhere A is the area of the burst boundary.\n\n\n4\nVerification of the conceptual energy conversion model\nFor a self-initiated strain burst, the energy available for rock fracture and rock ejection is the sum of the strain energies W\n\nb\n = (W\n\nbf\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nbk\n) and W\n\nm\n = (W\n\nmf\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nmk\n), as illustrated in Fig. 4. The energy from the surrounding rock mass, W\n\nm\n, increases with a decrease in the slope of the line AD that represents the overall stiffness of the rock mass. In other words, W\n\nm\n increases with decreasing overall stiffness of the surrounding rock mass. In principle, the overall radial stiffness of the underground opening is inversely related to the volume of the opening. In the case of a rock burst, the radial stiffness of the burst pit is inversely related to the burst depth. In this section, we shall first demonstrate the dependence of the strain energy released from the surrounding rock mass on the burst depth through numerical modeling. An analytical solution is then presented to the dependence of the energy release in a circular tunnel on the tunnel diameter.\n\n\n5\nNumerical verification for local breakout bursts\nIt is assumed that a self-initiated strain burst occurs in the roof of a tunnel in a relatively long segment so that the 3D burst pit can be simplified to a 2D notch for the sake of 2D numerical modeling. We take a cross-section perpendicular to the tunnel length in the middle of the burst area as an example. The movement of the boundary of the burst notch will be limited to the cross-sectional plane so that the work done by the principal stress parallel to the tunnel length will be zero. In other words, the strain energy released from the surrounding rock mass after the burst is only associated with the stresses on the boundary in the cross-section plane before bursting. For a planar slice of rock mass in the cross-section of the burst area, the expression for calculating the released strain energy W\n\nm\n, Eq. (1), can be simplified to:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nW\nm\n\n=\n\nD\n2\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n0\nS\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n3\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ni\nx\n\n\nl\n\n\u03b4\nx\n\n+\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n3\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ni\ny\n\n\nm\n\n\u03b4\ny\n\n\n]\n\nd\ns\n\n\n\nwhere D is the thickness of the slice in the direction of the tunnel length and S is the length of the burst boundary in the cross-sectional plane. Referring to the sketches in Fig. 6\n, \u03c3\n\nix\n and \u03c3\n\niy\n are the components of the principal stresses \u03c3\n\ni\n (\ni\n=1, 2, 3) on the burst boundary before bursting in the x- and y-axes; \u03b4\n\nx\n and \u03b4\n\ny\n are the x and y components of the boundary displacement after bursting; and l and m are the direction numbers of the normal line to the boundary element.\nAn ABAQUS 2D numerical model was constructed to simulate strain bursting of breakout failure. The circular tunnel in the model was 8\u00a0m in diameter. Only the upper half of the tunnel was simulated owing to the symmetry of the problem. The model dimensions were 40\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0m (width\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0height). The x-displacement and y-displacement were restrained on the horizontal and upper boundaries of the model, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7\n, and the y-displacement was additionally restrained on the bottom boundary of the model. The out-of-plane of the model was completely restrained, i.e., a plane-strain condition was assumed, and the normal strain was zero. With such a boundary condition applied, no external energy could enter the system. The in situ stresses applied to the model were 40\u00a0MPa horizontally and 20\u00a0MPa vertically. The breakout notch was created in the middle of the tunnel roof in every burst simulation, as shown in Fig. 6. The width of the notch was kept constant at a value of 3\u00a0m, whereas the depth varied from 0.2\u00a0m to 2.7\u00a0m in the simulations. Quadrilateral elements were used for model meshing. The burst area was densely meshed in order to enhance the calculation accuracy. Fig. 8\n shows an example of the model meshing. The model material was homogeneous, isotropic, and elastic. The properties of the material were a Young's modulus value of 70\u00a0GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.2. The modeling was performed in two steps for each burst depth. In the first step, the principal stresses along the boundary of the potential burst were calculated and the strain energy stored in the potential burst rock, W\n\nb\n, was calculated after the tunnel excavation. In the second step, the burst rock was removed to create the breakout notch and the model was then run to equilibrium. The average displacement vector of each element on the burst boundary was then registered. As an example, Fig. 9\n shows the cloud images of the major principal stress \u03c3\n1 both before and after a burst of 1.2\u00a0m depth. The work done by the surrounding rock mass along the burst boundary, W\n\nm\n, is calculated according to Eq. (2). The simulated results for the released strain energies are presented in Fig. 10\n. As shown in the diagrams, the energies released from both the burst rock and the surrounding rock mass increase with the burst depth, however, the increase in the energy from the surrounding rock mass accelerates with increasing burst depth. The released strain energy W\n\nm\n increases nonlinearly with burst depth or volume. The burst rock releases more energy than the surrounding rock mass when the burst depth is small, e.g., 0.2\u00a0m, implying that the burst magnitude is dominantly determined by the energy released from the burst rock itself in shallow burst events. In contrast, the energy released from the surrounding rock mass plays a more important role than the energy released from the burst rock when the burst depth is relatively large, such as at a depth value of 2\u00a0m. Fig. 11\n shows the ratio of W\n\nm\n to the total released energy, (W\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nm\n), versus burst depth. At a ratio of 0.5, the burst rock and the surrounding rock mass contribute identical amounts of energy to the rockburst; above 0.5, the surrounding rock mass contributes more energy. In the calculated example, a ratio of 0.5 corresponds to a burst depth of approximately 0.76\u00a0m.\n\n\n6\nAnalytical verification\nThe relationship between the energy ratio and the burst depth (or volume) as verified by the numerical simulations is also valid in all underground excavations, that is, the energy released from the surrounding rock mass as a proportion of the total amount of released energy increases with increasing excavation volume. This statement is also verified in this section through an analytical study of the energy release involved in the process of enlarging the diameter of a circular tunnel. It is assumed that a circular tunnel is excavated in an infinitely large, homogeneous, and isotropic rock mass that is subjected to a far-field hydrostatic stress p\no in the cross-section plane. The elastic strain energy density at radius r in the rock mass is expressed by:\n\n(3)\n\n\ne\n=\n\n\n1\n+\n\u03bd\n\nE\n\n\np\no\n2\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n+\n\n\na\n4\n\n\nr\n4\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere a represents the initial tunnel radius, E is the Young's modulus of the rock mass, and \u03bd is the Poisson's ratio. We assume that the tunnel is enlarged from radius a to b, as shown in Fig. 12\n. The elastic strain energy stored in the excavated portion of the rock from a to b, denoted by W\n\nb\n, is released after the radius enlargement and its amount is obtained by integrating Eq. (3) over the region a to b:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nW\nb\n\n=\n\n\n1\n+\n\u03bd\n\nE\n\n\u03c0\n\np\no\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\u2212\n\na\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n+\n\n\na\n2\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe radial stress in the rock at radius b before the radius enlargement, according to the Kirsch equations, is given by:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\nb\n\n\n=\n\np\no\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\na\n2\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\np\no\n\n\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\u2212\n\na\n2\n\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increment of the elastic radial displacement at radius b after the radius enlargement is:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\u0394\n\nu\nb\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n+\n\u03bd\n\nE\n\n\np\no\n\n\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\u2212\n\na\n2\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between \u03c3\n\nrb\n and the radial displacement increment \u0394u\n\nb\n is expressed as:\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\nb\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nK\n\nr\nb\n\n\n\u0394\n\nu\nb\n\n\n\n\nwhere K\n\nrb\n is the radial stiffness of the tunnel after the radius is enlarged to b, which is expressed as:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\nK\n\nr\nb\n\n\n=\n\nE\n\nb\n\n(\n\n1\n+\n\u03bd\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe radial stress drops linearly to zero after a radial displacement of \u0394u\n\nb\n occurs after the radius enlargement. The energy released from the surrounding rock mass, W\n\nm\n, can be calculated from \u03c3\nrb and \u0394u\nb. This quantity is given by:\n\n(8)\n\n\n\nW\nm\n\n=\n\n\n1\n+\n\u03bd\n\nE\n\n\u03c0\n\np\no\n2\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\u2212\n\na\n2\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ratio of W\n\nm\n to the total strain energy released from both the excavated rock and from the surrounding rock mass, (W\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nm\n), is obtained from Eqs. (4) and (8) and is expressed as:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\nW\nm\n\n\n\nW\nb\n\n+\n\nW\nm\n\n\n\n=\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\na\n2\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe influence of the radius enlargement on the radial stiffness and energy release of the surrounding rock mass is demonstrated in the following calculation example. Assume that the initial radius of the tunnel is a\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0m, the Young's modulus of the medium E\u00a0=\u00a070\u00a0GPa, the Poisson's ratio \u03bd\u00a0=\u00a00.2, and the far-field hydrostatic stress p\n\no\n\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0MPa. The ratio of the energy released from the surrounding medium to the total released strain energy, i.e., W\n\nm\n\/(W\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nm\n), expressed by Eq. (9), is plotted with the back line in Fig. 13\n versus the increment in the tunnel radius. The energy released from the surrounding medium is only approximately 13% of the total released strain energy when the enlargement depth is 0.5\u00a0m; however, it increases to 42% when the depth is 3\u00a0m. Therefore, the surrounding medium releases more energy when the enlargement depth is greater.\nThe analytical solution expressed by Eq. (9) was further verified using FLAC3D numerical models. The numerical model size in each case was 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.125\u00a0m (length\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0width\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0depth). Constant stress and constant strain conditions were applied to the boundaries of the models. Constant stresses of 30\u00a0MPa were applied at the boundaries of one model and zero displacement was applied to the other model, i.e., fixed boundaries. The out-of-plane of the models was fixed to be in a zero-strain condition. In both models, the tunnel diameter was 8\u00a0m. For the model with fixed boundary condition, the model was first run to equilibrium under the applied in situ stresses p\n\no\n\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0MPa; the boundaries were then fixed in the x, y, and z directions, and the 8\u00a0m tunnel was then excavated.\nThe input data of the relevant parameters are the same as those used in the analytical analysis. The radius of the tunnel a\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0m; the tunnel radius increases to a value of b = (4\u00a0+\u00a0d) after enlargement, where d is the radius increment. The first step of the modeling was to excavate the 8\u00a0m tunnel and determine the radial stress \u03c3\n\nrb\n and the radial displacement u\n1 in the position of radius b. The material in the ring from a to b was then removed and the radial displacement at b, i.e., u\n2, was found.\nThe numerical simulation results of the energy ratio W\n\nm\n\/(W\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0W\n\nm\n) are also presented in Fig. 13 versus the increment in the tunnel radius for the sake of comparison with the analytical solution of Eq. (9). The numerical results slightly deviate from the analytical solution, however, their variation trends are the same as the analytical solution. Note that the deviations of the numerical results from the analytical solution are caused by the boundary conditions of the models. It is logically correct that the analytical solution is located between the numerical results under the two boundary conditions since the rock is subjected to neither constant stresses nor zero displacement in the position of the model boundaries in the analytical solution.\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nTwo conceptual models were proposed to examine in detail the energy sources and their conversions involved in rockburst events. The prerequisite for a rockburst is that there must be excess kinetic energy after rock failure. The total kinetic energy W\n\nk\n in a rockburst event is generally composed of three portions: one converted from the strain energy stored in the burst rock (W\n\nbk\n), one from the strain energy released from the surrounding rock mass (W\n\nmk\n), and one from the seismic energy (W\n\nsk\n). For a self-initiated strain burst, the kinetic energy is only composed of the W\n\nbk\n and W\n\nmk\n terms. The portion of the kinetic energy from the burst rock, W\n\nbk\n, i.e. the intrinsic burst energy, is a constant per unit volume for a given lithology, but the portion from the surrounding rock mass, W\n\nmk\n, increases with burst volume and depth. The magnitude of a shallow strain burst is mainly determined by the intrinsic burst energy of the burst rock itself, whereas, the strain energy released from the surrounding rock mass plays a more important role in rock ejection when the burst involves a large volume of rock. The relative role of the strain energy released from the surrounding rock mass was verified numerically and analytically in this study.\nThe key significance of the study is that it proves that the magnitude of a shallow strain burst is mainly determined by the intrinsic burst energy of the burst rock, whereas, the kinetic energy of a powerful deep and large-scale strain burst is mainly contributed by the surrounding rock mass. The proportion of the kinetic energy from the surrounding rock mass increases nonlinearly with the burst volume and depth. The implication of this study for engineering applications is that the attention of rockburst support design should be paid to the strain energy stored in the potential burst rock when it is estimated that light strain bursts are to occur, whereas the support design must take into account the contribution of the energy released from the surrounding rock mass.\n\n","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"","64":"","65":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nCoalbeds are often recognised as energy resources and storage reservoirs for geological sequestration of greenhouse gases, such as, carbon dioxide (CO2). Due to its extensive volume, the global coal deposits have significant potential to reduce the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere.\n1\n Over the years, a number of field demonstration projects have been conducted across the world to store CO2 in coal seams.\n2\n\n,\n\n3\n The pilot trials regularly reported the swelling-induced loss of gas injectivity and struggled to achieve a sustained rate of gas injection into the seams.\n4\u20137\n CO2 adsorption in coal results in swelling of the coal matrix and reduce the permeability at the vicinity of the injection well.\n8\n\n,\n\n9\n This leaves the bulk of the coal seam unused and questions the feasibility and practicality of the technologies pertinent to carbon sequestration in coal. Therefore, to address the gas injection and storage issues, comprehensive understanding of coal swelling and permeability behaviours are of paramount importance.\nCoalbeds are naturally fractured sedimentary rocks, and are generally characterised by i) a well-defined and nearly uniform distributed network of natural fractures, known as cleats, and ii) by multiscale porous blocks that reside between the fractures, known as coal matrix.\n10\n Coal contains two distinct types of cleats, e.g., face cleat and butt cleat. The face cleats are well-developed, widely spaced, nearly parallel fissures that run continuously throughout a coal seam. Butt cleats are perpendicular to the face cleats and poorly-developed fractures of limited length, and often terminate at the face cleats. Both type of cleats are nominally vertical, and perpendicular to the bedding planes.\n11\n\n,\n\n12\n Cleat system provides the primary conduits for fluid flow in coalbeds,\n12\n and the permeability of coal is predominantly dependent on the properties of the cleat networks. The distribution of cleats in coalbeds leads to anisotropic permeability where the greatest permeability occurs in the direction of the face cleats. This has been observed in both field observations and laboratory measurements and, therefore, questions the notion of isotropic material behaviour that is often considered in theoretical and numerical modelling studies. For example, Koenig and Stubbs\n13\n reported that from the field tests in the Rock Creek coalbeds of the Warrior Basin in the USA, the permeability of coal in the direction parallel to the bedding plane is 17 times higher than that of the direction vertical to the bedding plane. Massarotto et al.\n14\n investigated the permeability anisotropy of coals using a unique true tri-axial test in laboratory coal samples, and they reported that the permeability of coal was significantly directional. Another important, anisotropic property of coal is the directional swelling. Many laboratory experiments have confirmed the anisotropy of coal swelling. Day et al.\n15\n measured the CO2 adsorption-induced swelling of three Australian bituminous coals at pressures up to 15\u00a0MPa with an optical method, and observed that the swelling in the plane perpendicular to the bedding plane was always significantly higher than that of the parallel plane. Similar results have been reported by Pan and Connell\n16\n and Liu et al.\n17\n The consequence of adsorption-induced coal deformations is that the in-situ stress field becomes disturbed,\n7\n and it can further change the permeability behaviour. Therefore, accurate representation of the anisotropic coal swelling together with anisotropic permeability is essential.\nPermeability change in coal is generally attributed to the net impacts of both effective stress and adsorption\/desorption induced swelling\/shrinkage stress or strains.\n9\n Based on this concept, many permeability models have been developed to study the permeability behaviour of coals. A comprehensive review of these models is available in Liu et al.\n18\n and Pan and Connell.\n9\n Majority of these models assumed isotropy of coal properties and swelling behaviour. The permeability evolution is generally linked to the change in coal porosity using a cubic relationship between permeability, porosity, and different stress\u2013strain relationships. Undoubtedly, these previous studies have enriched our understanding of coal permeability evolution, nevertheless, the anisotropy of the material and its behaviour have been often neglected. Gu and Chalaturnyk\n19\n suggested that the change of permeability is anisotropic (due to the difference between butt cleats and face cleats) even though the initial permeability is assumed to be isotropic. The results presented by Liu et al.\n20\n indicated that the application of isotropic deformation in permeability model could overestimate the permeability loss compared to the anisotropic deformation. Thus, anisotropic deformation should be considered to predict the coal permeability behaviour.\nIn recent years, a few anisotropic permeability models have been proposed to study the directional permeability behaviour of coal. Wang et al.\n21\n developed an anisotropic permeability model by incorporating anisotropy of structural and mechanical deformation. Liu et al.\n22\n derived a cleat aperture-dependent anisotropic permeability model, in which, a modulus reduction ratio is used to link the anisotropic deformation to the evolution of directional permeabilities. Pan and Connell\n16\n presented an anisotropic permeability model by extending the swelling model of Pan and Connell.\n23\n Like most of the isotropic permeability models, the aforementioned models assumed that the impacts of effective stress and shrinkage\/swelling on coal permeability are independent. Pure stress or strain superposition was used to obtain the total changes in stress or strain, which was resulted from the pressure change and the shrinkage\/swelling of the coal matrix. Actually, changes of strain or stress caused by pressure and shrinkage\/swelling of coal are inter-related, especially under in situ conditions.\n24\n The coupled anisotropic permeability model developed by Gu and Chalaturnyk\n19\n shows some advantages in the analysis of anisotropic permeability, which considers discontinuous coal mass (containing cleats and matrix) to be an equivalent elastic continuum taking into account the cleat structure and characteristics of cleat deformation. However, the aperture changes in different directions are still quantified with the principle of strain superposition. The deformation of cleat aperture is closely related to cleat compressibility.\n25\n Recent studies show that coal-gas interaction can alter the cleat compressibility,\n26\n this important coupled effect has been ignored in the previous permeability models.\nThe purpose of this work is to present a comprehensive model that accounts for both anisotropic swelling and permeability behaviour in a practical and rigorous manner. Adsorption of gases on pores of coal matrices can alter the surfaces stress, influencing its effective stress. Firstly, an effective stress model for an anisotropic fractured porous media with dual porosity is derived using the surface stress approach. It is then used to describe anisotropic macroscopic coal swelling with anisotropic mechanical properties. Compared to the exiting anisotropic swelling model, the number of required parameters is reduced in the proposed model. An anisotropic, stress-dependent coal permeability model is then derived, in which directional fracture compressibilities are introduced. Stress or strain superposition is avoided compered to existing permeability models. More importantly, the impact of coal-gas interaction on cleat compressibility is considered in the proposed model. These new features of model could advance the understandings of coal permeability evolution. The accuracy and reliability of the developed models are examined by comparing the model results with relevant experimental data. Finally, the impacts of anisotropic swelling on coal permeability are investigated for different boundary conditions. The model can be used to study the mechanisms that control deformation and anisotropic permeability evolutions of coal, which are important for better predictions and analysis of subsurface carbon sequestration and coalbed methane recovery techniques.\n\n\n2\nThe model\n\n2.1\nTheoretical development of anisotropic deformation\nAssuming that the deformation behaviour of a fractured coal is linear and elastic, the stress-strain relationship can be expressed in an incremental form as:\n27\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\nd\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\ni\nj\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\nC\n\ni\nj\nk\nl\n\n\nd\n\n\u03b5\n\nk\nl\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n(2)\n\n\nd\n\n\u03b5\n\ni\nj\n\n\n=\n\nD\n\ni\nj\nk\nl\n\n\nd\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nk\nl\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\ni\nj\n\n\u2032\n\n\n or \n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nk\nl\n\n\u2032\n\n\n is a component of second-order stress tensor, \n\n\n\u03b5\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n or \n\n\n\u03b5\n\nk\nl\n\n\n\n is a component of second-order strain tensor. \n\n\nC\n\ni\nj\nk\nl\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nD\n\ni\nj\nk\nl\n\n\n\n are respectively fourth order elastic stiffness and elastic compliance tensors, and \n\nD\n=\n\nC\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n.\nConsidering a multi-phase system that includes solid aggregates, bulk fluids in fractures and in porous matrix, as well as adsorbed fluids at the interface between the solid and the bulk fluid (see Fig. 1\n), the effective stress (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\ni\nj\n\n\u2032\n\n\n) for the bulk coals can be expressed as (see Appendix for the detailed derivation):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\ni\nj\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\ni\nj\n\n\n+\n\np\nf\ns\n\n\n\u03b4\n\ni\nj\n\n\n+\n\nb\n\nm\ni\nj\n\n\n\n(\n\n\np\nm\n\n\u2212\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\n)\n\n+\n\nb\n\nf\ni\nj\n\n\n\n(\n\n\np\nf\n\n\u2212\n\np\nf\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c3\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n is the total stress, \n\n\np\nm\n\n\n is fluid pressure in matrix pores, \n\n\np\nf\n\n\n is fluid pressure in fracturs. \n\n\nb\n\nm\ni\nj\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nb\n\nf\ni\nj\n\n\n\n are effective stress coefficients associated with fluid pressures in matrices and fractures, respectively.

Fracture opening, intensity, tortuosity, and connectivity can affect the permeation of fluid through the cross-section. Generally, fluid flow through parallel straight fracture can be captured by cubic law.\n32\n Considering the effects of fracture intensity, tortuosity, and connectivity, the coal permeability can be expressed as:\n33\n\n\n\n(12)\n\n\nk\n=\n\n\nR\nc\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nD\nf\n\n\n\na\n3\n\n12\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03c4\n\n is fracture tortuosity, \n\n\nR\nc\n\n\n is fracture connectivity, \n\n\nD\nf\n\n\n is fracture intensity and \n\na\n\n is the averaged fracture aperture.\nThe fracture porosity, \n\n\nn\nf\n\n\n, can be estimated as:\n\n(13)\n\n\n\nn\nf\n\n=\na\nA\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nA\n\n is the specific surface area of fractures, defined as the area of total fracture surface per unit volume of coals.\nSubstituting equation (13) into equation (12) yields:\n\n(14)\n\n\nk\n=\n\n\nR\nc\n\n\u03c4\n\n\n\nD\nf\n\n\nA\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn\nf\n\n3\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation (14) can be extended for the ith directional permeability as:\n\n(15)\n\n\n\nk\ni\n\n=\n\n\n\nR\nc\n\ni\n\n\n\u03c4\ni\n\n\n\n\nD\n\nf\ni\n\n\n\nA\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\nf\ni\n\n\n3\n\n12\n\n,\n\ni\n=\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be seen from equation (15) that the fracture permeability in coal is mainly dependent on three factors: fracture distribution characteristics (tortuosity and connectivity), intensity, and size (\n\n\nn\n\nf\ni\n\n\n\n). It is generally assumed that the fracture distribution characteristics and the fracture intensity coefficients remain constant during fluid flow.\n33\n However, the fracture porosity varies with the flow.\n33\n Following work, it is assumed that the fracture porosity is mainly due to change in fracture aperture. On the other hand, fracture closure or opening is associated with variation of stress normal to surface stress.\n34\n Under true triaxial stress conditions, as shown in Fig. 2, permeability is affected by the variation of each principal stresses\n35\n\n,\n\n36\n acting on the coals.

In addition to the effective stresses, gas adsorption can alter fracture compressibility. Laboratory experiments on gas adsorption in coal revealed that coal-gas interaction can lead to enhancement the coal compressibility.\n26\n\n,\n\n37\n McKee et al.\n38\n presented a stress dependent fracture compressibility relationship, which has been extended here to describe the anisotropic fracture:\n\n(20)\n\n\n\nC\n\nf\ni\nj\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nC\n\nf\ni\nj\n0\n\n\n\nf\n\na\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nj\nj\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\nj\nj\n0\n\n\u2032\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n1\n\u2212\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03b1\ni\n\nj\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nj\nj\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\nj\nj\n0\n\n\u2032\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nC\n\nf\ni\nj\n0\n\n\n\n is the initial fracture compressibility, \n\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n is the fracture compressibility change rate, and the \n\n\nf\n\na\ni\n\n\n\n is a factor representing the adsorption-induced change in compressibility of coal in the ith direction.\nExperimental observations provide persuasive evidence that the coal-gas interaction causes severe mechanical degradations in coal, e.g.,\n39\n\n,\n\n40\n and this interaction induced mechanical alterations depends on the coal type, adsorbed gases, interaction duration and confining stress.\n41\n It is believed that gas adsorption can cause fracture walls to be weakened,\n41\n the reciprocal of fracture compressibility can be assumed to be negatively related to gas adsorption. To consider the dependence of fracture compressibility on factors mentioned above, the following Langmuir-type relationship is proposed to describe the effect of coal-gas interaction on fracture compressibility in this work:\n\n(21)\n\n\n1\n\nf\n\na\ni\n\n\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nm\n=\n1\n\n\nn\ng\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\nm\ni\n\n\n\nb\n\nL\nm\n\n\n\nx\nm\n\n\np\nm\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\u2211\n\nm\n=\n1\n\n\nn\ng\n\n\n\nb\n\nL\nm\n\n\n\nx\nm\n\n\np\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03b3\n\nm\ni\n\n\n\n is a constant accounting for maximum variation of fracture compressibility due to adsorption-induced weakening effect of mth gas component.\nFrom equation (19) it is evident that the directional permeability can be affected by the change of principal stresses in any direction. This provides a tool to quantify the effects of stresses in all directions on coal permeability. For isotropic conditions, the fracture compressibility is identical in all three directions, which results into a permeability model similar to that of Seidle et al.\n42\n and Cui and Bustin.\n43\n In that case, mean stress is used in equation (18). On the other hand, when the effect of only horizontal stress is considered, the model is analogous to the permeability model of Shi and Durucan.\n44\n However, in their permeability models, the effect of adsorption-induced deformation on permeability is neglected. With respect to CBM extraction, carbon storage and underground coal mining activities, the in-situ stress is generally anisotropic, and a coal seam is likely to be under true triaxial stress conditions.\nPlease note that the developed anisotropic permeability model requires nine cleat compressibility factors, which can be easily determined from laboratory experiments. The estimation procedure of the nine direction-dependent fracture compressibility will be provided in Section 3.2.2.\n\n\n\n3\nModel validation\nThis section presents a series of validation tests to analyse the reliability of proposed models for interpreting anisotropic swelling and permeability behaviour of coals. Relevant experimental data published in the works\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n\n,\n\n35\n\n,\n\n45\n are used as a benchmark.\n\n3.1\nAnisotropic coal swelling\nDay et al.\n15\n used an optical method to directly measure CO2-induced swelling in three Australian bituminous coals obtained from the Hunter Valley, Illawarra region, and Bowen Basin. The test temperatures varied between 25 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C, and pressures up to 15\u00a0MPa in an incremental manner. Day et al.\n15\n presented the linear expansion results of Sample 1 from the Hunter Valley, conducted at 40\u00a0\u00b0C, and reported that the results of the other two samples were identical.\nDirectional swelling strains of a bituminous coal sample from the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia, were measured by Pan and Connell\n16\n in a triaxial permeability cell. They measured gas adsorption and permeability under hydrostatic conditions. The radial and axial displacements were measured at each adsorption step to obtain the swelling strain. They measured the directional deformations for different gas species (CO2, CH4, N2). Following Pan and Connell,\n16\n gas adsorption behaviour is captured by Langmuir isotherm.\nHere, the directions parallel to the bedding are set as x- and y-axis, and the direction perpendicular to the bedding is z-axis. The experimental results revealed that the swelling strains in the two directions parallel to the bedding plane are almost the same. Therefore, the mechanical parameter, Young's modulus is assumed to be constant and equal in the x and y directions. In other words, the coal is considered as transversely isotropic. The coal swelling strains were recorded at the equilibrium state; thus, the fluid pressure in coal matrices and fractures are considered to be identical, i.e. \n\n\np\nm\n\n=\n\np\nf\n\n=\np\n\n. Due to lack of information, it is assumed that the effective stress coefficients in three directions are same, i.e. \n\n\nb\n\nm\ni\ni\n\n\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n\n, \n\n\nb\n\nf\ni\ni\n\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a0\n\n\nb\nf\n\n\n (no summation on repeated index here). Since gas adsorption occurs largely in the coal matrix, surface of coal pores mainly depends on coal matrix porosity, thus, \n\n\n\n\u03be\nf\n\n=\n0\n\n.\n8\n\n,\n\n28\n Under an unjacketed experimental condition (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ni\ni\n\n\n=\n\u2212\np\n\n). Therefore, the effectives stresses in the three axis directions are reduced to:\n\n(22)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\ni\ni\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n(\n\nb\n\u2212\n1\n\n)\n\np\n+\n\u03a8\nR\nT\nln\n\n(\n\n1\n+\np\n\nb\nL\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nb\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n+\n\nb\nf\n\n\n, \n\n\u03a8\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n\n\u03be\nm\n\n\n\u0393\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n. Equation (22), in combination with equation (10) are solved analytically to calculate swelling strains of the coal samples. The model parameters obtained from the validation exercises are listed in Table 1\n. Pan and Connell\n16\n developed an anisotropic coal swelling model (P\u2013C model) to match these experimental data. And it is shown that the estimated values of Young moduli and Poison's ratio in all directions are very closed to those obtained by Pan and Connell\n16\n for both Day et al.\u2019s data and Pan and Connell's data.\nThe model predicted swelling strains are compared against the results of Day et al.\n15\n and Pan and Connell\n16\n in Fig. 3\n and Fig. 4\n, respectively. The predicted results agree well with both experimental measurements indicating that the proposed swelling model can describe adsorption-induced anisotropic coal deformation behaviour both quantitatively and qualitatively. In all cases, expansion in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane is greater than that in the parallel plane. For example, in Fig. 3, at 10\u00a0MPa CO2 pressure, swelling strain in the direction parallel to the bedding plane is approx. 0.52%. Whereas in the perpendicular direction it is 0.82%, an increase of 57.6% in swelling strain.\nAdsorption-induced swelling strain behaviour of coal is gas species dependent, as illustrated in Fig. 4. More CO2 generally adsorbs in coal than CH4 or N2. From equation (6), it can be shown that the reduction of surface stress due to the adsorption of CO2 is more significant than CH4 or N2. This is why coal exhibits larger swelling strain in contact with CO2 than CH4 and N2.\nIn order to evaluate the performance of developed anisotropic model, the presented swelling model and the P\u2013C model are tested against experimental results and are presented in Fig. 5\n. The experimental data by Pan and Connell\n16\n for CO2 are used as the benchmark. The parameters for P\u2013C model are listed in Table 2\n. Compared to P\u2013C model, the number of required parameters for the proposed model is reduced. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that both models underestimate swelling strain when pressure is lower and overestimate for higher pressure. A possible cause for these differences is that estimated surface stress constant for proposed model and Langmuir volume constant for P\u2013C model are an average over the whole pressure range, the values for higher pressure may be overestimated because compression of coal due to higher pressure could reduce gas adsorption.\n46\n In comparison, P\u2013C model show slightly better fitting when pressure ranges from 2 to 6\u00a0MPa. However, when pressure is higher, the deviation of P\u2013C model from experimental results is significantly more than that of the proposed model in this study.\n\n\n3.2\nAnisotropic and isotropic permeability\n\n3.2.1\nRobertson's permeability data (isotropic)\nIn this work, a weakening coefficient is introduced in the permeability model, for the first time, to explain the effect of change in mechanical properties of fractures due to gas adsorption and permeability evolution. Its rationality can be examined via experimental measurements of coal permeability under stress controlled conditions. Most the laboratory tests on coal permeability evolution for varied pressures or varied confining stresses were conducted in one direction, e.g.\n37\n\n,\n\n45\n\n,\n\n47\n Robertson\n45\n performed two sets of experimental tests on coal permeability to investigate, firstly, the effect of confining stress on coal permeability by keeping gas pressure constant but varying confining stress (same confining pressure to all surfaces of the cores); and secondly, the effect of gas pressure on coal permeability by keeping confining pressure constant and by varying gas pressure. The details are available in Robertson.\n45\n The experimental results for one coal sample, Anderson 01, are used as benchmark for this validation test. When confining pressure varies but holding gas pressure remains constant, the permeability model is reduced to the following form:\n\n(23)\n\n\n\nk\nx\n\n=\n\nk\n\nx\n0\n\n\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n[\n\n\n(\n\n\nC\n\nf\nx\nx\n\n\n+\n\nC\n\nf\nx\ny\n\n\n+\n\nC\n\nf\nx\nz\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\nc\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\nc\n0\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when the confining pressure is constant, the permeability model for varying gas pressure can be expressed as:\n\n(24)\n\n\n\nk\nx\n\n=\n\nk\n\nx\n0\n\n\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n[\n\n\n(\n\n\nC\n\nf\nx\nx\n\n\n+\n\nC\n\nf\nx\ny\n\n\n+\n\nC\n\nf\nx\nz\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nc\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n\nb\nf\n\np\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \n\n\n\u03c3\nc\n\n\n is confining pressure.\nThe parameters used in this analytical validation test are listed in Table 3\n. The coal sample is assumed to be isotropic, i.e. \n\n\n\nC\n\nf\nx\nx\n\n\n=\n\nC\n\nf\nx\ny\n\n\n=\n\nC\n\nf\nx\nz\n\n\n=\n\nC\nf\n\n\n. The permeability results obtained from the experimental tests with varying confining stress are used to estimate the initial fracture compressibility and fracture compressibility change rate. Following that the experimental data of different gases (CO2, CH4, and N2) are used to estimate the weakening coefficient. Langmuir pressure constants for different gases are chosen from Chen et al..\n8\n The validation results are presented in Fig. 6\n. To keep consistent with experimental results presented by Robertson,\n45\n when considering the effect of confining stress on coal permeability, the permeability tested at net stress of 900 psi is selected as a basis to show the variation of permeability, as shown in Fig. 6(a). When considering the effect of gas pressure on coal permeability, the permeability of coal at gas pressure 100 psi are selected as a basis for CO2, N2 and CO2\/N2 mixture, as shown in Fig. 6 (b, d, e), while the permeability of coal tested at gas pressure 72 psi are selected as a basis for CH4, as shown in Fig. 6 (c). The accuracy of the proposed model results is compared to the fitting results of both Shi-Durucan model (S-D model) and the Palmer-Mansoori model (P-M model) in Fig. 6.\nCompared to predictions of both S-D model and P-M model, there is a better agreement between the experimental measurements and predictions of the permeability model proposed in this work (see Fig. 6). More importantly, the proposed model can describe the coal permeability evolution induced by different gas species and gas mixture using a common set of coal properties. It is shown that the coal permeability decreases as the confining stress increases. At constant confining stress, the coal permeability decreases with gas pressure, reaches to a minimum, and thereafter, starts to rebound. This is because with increasing effective stress the fracture compressibility reduces, which is shown in Fig. 7\n for various gases. It is observed that the change in compressibility is species dependent. The fracture compressibility undergoes a nearly linear increase with gas pressure due to combined effects of effective stress decrease and gas adsorption induced structural alteration. For example, it was shown when gas pressure increases from 0.67\u00a0MPa (100 psi) to 5.5\u00a0MPa (800 psi), the fracture compressibility for CO2 increases from 0.073\u00a0MPa\u22121 (0.0005 psi\u22121) to 0.20\u00a0MPa\u22121 (0.00138 psi\u22121). Similar findings were also reported in Pan et al.\n37\n and Peng et al.\n26\n For example, Pan et al.\n37\n reported that the fracture compressibility of coals for CO2 increased from 0.05\u00a0MPa\u22121 to 0.125\u00a0MPa\u22121 with pressure. It can be seen that compressibility increases for CO2 are comparable to those presented in Pan et al.\n37\n\n\nThis finding can be used to explain why coal permeability continue to decrease although the net stress for fractures decreases. At lower gas pressures, although the net stress acting on fractures is reduced, the fracture compressibility increases due to gas adsorption induced coal structure change, and the fractures can be compressed at this stage. However, with an increase in gas pressure, the impact of gas pressure becomes dominant and the fractures re-open, resulting in an increase of coal permeability, as shown in Fig. 5. This can explain why coal permeability continue to decrease although the net stress for fractures decreases.\n\n\n3.2.2\nDuan et al.\u2019s permeability data (anisotropic)\nExperimental data of Duan et al.\n35\n are used to examine the accuracy of the presented anisotropic permeability model. Duan et al.\n35\n investigated the influence of anisotropy of coal structure and stress state on permeability evolution using a multifunctional true triaxial geophysical apparatus. They carried out mechanical and seepage experiments on cubic coal samples of 100\u00a0mm \n\n\u00d7\n\n 100\u00a0mm \n\n\u00d7\n\n 100\u00a0mm dimensions. Permeability of the coal samples in three directions under true triaxial stress conditions was tested. Nine different experimental conditions were designed to consider different stress conditions and flow directions, as shown in Fig. 8\n. There are three kinds of loading path: 1) minimum principal stress is perpendicular to bedding, 2) intermediate principal stress is perpendicular to bedding and 3) maximum principal stress is perpendicular to bedding. For each loading path, the maximum stress of 50\u00a0MPa and minimum stress of 10\u00a0MPa were kept constant, and the intermediate stress was increased from 10 to 50\u00a0MPa step by step. Flow in each direction was tested with three different loading paths. In following, the designed flow in x direction with three loading paths are defined as L1F1, L2F1, L3F1, flow along the direction y as L1F2, L2F2, L3F2 and flow along direction z as L1F3, L2F3, L3F3.\nEquation (19) is used to predict the coal permeability variation in each direction. The model parameters are estimated by fitting the experimental results. Fig. 9\n shows the estimated material parameters including initial permeability in three directions and anisotropic compressibility. The permeability was tested with a low, constant gas pressure of 1\u00a0MPa. Change in loading is the only factor that affects the evolution of permeability. Due to the low permeability of the coal samples, the compressibility is assumed to be constant. In this validation test, the permeability data for L1F1, L2F1 and L3F1 are used for estimation of the initial permeability in the x-direction, and compressibility C\n\nfxx\n, C\n\nfxy\n, C\n\nfxz\n. The permeability data for L1F2, L2F2, L3F2 for the initial permeability in the y-direction, and compressibility C\n\nfyx\n, C\n\nfyy\n, C\n\nfyz\n. The permeability data under L1F3, L2F3, L3F3 for initial permeability in the z-direction, and compressibility C\n\nfzx\n, C\n\nfzy\n, C\n\nfzz\n. The estimated initial permeability in all directions is the permeability at unstressed conditions.\nThe same coal sample was used for all tests under different flow indirection and stress condition, loading and unloading for each test could cause the slight loss of permeability due to irreversible permeability. Thus, the estimated parameters may deviate slightly from their actual value From Fig. 9(a), the estimated initial permeability in the x-direction is between 1.16 and 2.38 times greater than in y- and z-directions in this experiment. Fig. 9(b) shows that the estimated compressibility values related to stress applied perpendicularly to the bedding, are larger than the flow parallel to the bedding. This implies that the permeability parallel to the bedding is more sensitive to change in stress perpendicular to the bedding. In addition, it can be observed that when the flow direction is identical to the applied stress direction, the compressibility is lower, especially in the direction parallel to the bedding, while it is higher for stress vertical to flow direction. For example, when flow is along the x-cleat direction, the compressibility C\n\nfxx\n is 0.001\u00a0MPa\u22121 but C\n\nfx\n\n\ny\n is 0.0052\u00a0MPa\u22121\n. None of the compressibility parameters is estimated to be zero indicating that the permeability is affected by the stress in all directions.\n\nFig. 10\n compares the predicted responses with the experimental data of coal permeability from Duan et al.\n35\n It can be seen from Fig. 10 that the permeability evolution predicted by the model achieved a good agreement with the observations from the experimental test. Which is indicative of the reliability and effectiveness of the model. Duan et al.\n35\n presented an anisotropic permeability model to match their experimental results. The matching results of Duan et al.\u2019s model and the proposed model in this study are compared, as shown in Fig. 11\n. The experimental data for L1F1, L2F1 and L3F1 are used for benchmark. As expected, Fig. 11 shows that the Duan et al.\u2019s model overestimates coal permeability, in contrast, the proposed model shows a better match.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults and discussions\nBoundary conditions can significantly influence coal permeability behaviour. In this section, the presented model has been applied to investigate the effect of anisotropic deformation on coal permeability under various boundary conditions including constant volume conditions, uniaxial strain condition, and plane strain condition. The estimated mechanic properties from validation tests with experimental results of Pan and Connell\n16\n and Duan et al.\n35\n as a benchmark are used in these cases, as listed in Table 4\n and Fig. 9. The permeability ratio is used to evaluate the change in permeability with pressure at equilibrium state, i.e. \n\n\np\nm\n\n=\n\np\nf\n\n=\np\n\n.\n\nCase 1: Constant volume condition\n\n\n\nUnder constant volume conditions, the vertical and horizontal strains are equal to zero, i.e.\n\n(25)\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\nx\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\ny\ny\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\nz\nz\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstituting equation (25) into equation (10) yields the effective stresses for bulk coal due to volume constrain, and it is expressed as:\n\n(26)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nx\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\ny\ny\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nz\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nInserting equation (26) into equation (3) and combing with equation (18), the changes in effective stresses only acting on fractures can be given as:\n\n(27)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nx\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\ny\ny\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nz\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining equation (27) with equation (19) and equation (8), the coal permeability with pressure is obtained. Equation (27) indicates the change in coal permeability is not related to the coal mechanical properties but only to pressure, the anisotropic coal swelling cannot affect the anisotropic coal permeability. The response curves of coal permeability for pure gas and gas mixture are shown in Fig. 12\n and Fig. 13\n.\n\nFig. 12 shows that coal permeability in all directions undergoes a significant decrease at a lower pressure when coal is completely constrained. For example, the permeability drops by about 83% in x-direction, 80% in y-direction and 63% in z-direction when pressure reaches 4\u00a0MPa. However, with increase of pressure, the permeability decease slows down. This is because the coal swelling increases quickly with pressure when it is lower, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. When the pressure is higher, the increase of coal swelling is marginal. When the gas mixture is used as interacted gases, although the coal permeability shows a decrease, this decrease is lessened compared to the variation of coal permeability with pure gas, as illustrated in Fig. 13. The higher the fractionation of N2 in the gas mixture, the lesser the decrease of coal permeability. When N2 takes up 80% of the gas mixture, the coal permeability drops by approximately 50% in x- and y-directions and 33% in the z-direction. The CO2 adsorption-induced coal swelling is greatly larger than that of N2 in coal. An increase in the fraction of N2 in the gas mixture will lead to a decrease in coal swelling. This is why the permeability of coal with gas mixture shows a relatively less reduction of its value.\nTo examine the predicted coal permeability with gas pressure, the laboratory tests were collected for comparison. Due to the fact that most of the experiments on coal permeability with gas pressure were conducted under constant confining pressure, or constant pressure difference between confining pressure and gas pressure, and permeability in only one direction were tested. In comparison, the permeability data tested under constant pressure difference conditions may be used to approximate the evolution of permeability under constant volume conditions. We collected the experimental data from literatures,\n48\u201355\n as shown in Fig. 14\n. The permeability ratio is defined as the ratio of permeability at the resting pressure to that at the initial pressure. As seen in Fig. 14, permeability of coal in all experiment tests experiences a significant drop with pressure, especially when pressure is lower. Model predicted permeability evolution above are similar to experimental tests and fall within the range of tested permeability ratio, which indicates the capacity of the permeability model for the predictive purpose.\n\nCase 2: Uniaxial strain condition\n\n\n\nThe uniaxial strain condition is widely used for reservoir boundary conditions where the zero lateral or horizontal strains are assumed everywhere in the domain, i.e.\n\n(28)\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\nx\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\ny\ny\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitution of equation (28) into equation (10) and solving equation (10) yields effective stress:\n\n(29)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nx\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\nE\nx\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\nz\nx\n\n\n+\n\nv\n\nz\ny\n\n\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nz\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(30)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\ny\ny\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\nE\ny\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nv\n\nz\ny\n\n\n+\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\nv\n\nz\nx\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nz\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining equations (29) and (30) with equations (3) and (18), the changes in effective stresses acting on fractures can be given as\n\n(31)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nx\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\nE\nx\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\nz\nx\n\n\n+\n\nv\n\nz\ny\n\n\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nz\nz\n\n\n+\nb\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(32)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\ny\ny\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\nE\ny\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nv\n\nz\ny\n\n\n+\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\nv\n\nz\nx\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nz\nz\n\n\n+\nb\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is further assumed that the overburden stress remains unchanged in reservoirs, i.e. \n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nz\nz\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\nz\nz\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\nz\nz\n0\n\n\n=\n0\n\n, equations (31) and (32) are written as:\n\n(33)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nx\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\nE\nx\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nv\n\nz\nx\n\n\n+\n\nv\n\nz\ny\n\n\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nb\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(34)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\ny\ny\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\nE\ny\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nv\n\nz\ny\n\n\n+\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\nv\n\nz\nx\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nv\n\ny\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nb\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n(35)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nz\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nb\nf\n\n\u0394\np\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitution of equations (33)\u2013(35) into equation (19) can generate permeability with pressure. Existing permeability models in literature for uniaxial strain conditions, consider that fluid pressure can changes stresses only in the vertical direction, and neglect the effects of vertical coal swelling.\n43\n\n,\n\n44\n\n,\n\n56\n However, in the presented model, the vertical swelling is considered via equations (33)\u2013(35). It can be seen from the equations that under uniaxial strain conditions, stress change is not only associated with coal-gas interaction but also with the mechanical properties of coal. To investigate the impacts of mechanical properties, e.g. Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio that are determined by fitting anisotropic swelling data of Pan and Connell\n16\n and Day et al.\n15\n in the previous section, are used to calculate the permeability ratio, and the results are shown in Fig. 15\n and Fig. 16\n. It can be observed that the permeability increases with pressure using the data of Pan and Connell.\n16\n However, when the mechanical properties data of Day et al.\n15\n is applied, the coal permeability experiences an initial drop with the pressure, reaches to a minimum, and then start to increase with pressure. The observed rebound behaviour in the data of Day et al.\n15\n is not present in that of the Pan and Connell.\n16\n Due to larger Poisson's ratio and role of vertical swelling in the data of Pan and Connell,\n16\n the increase of compressive stress in x- and y-directions is smaller. Also, the compressive stress in the vertical direction is reduced by gas pressure and vertical swelling, resulting in a negligible decrease in coal permeability. In contrast, the Poisson's ratio of coal from the data of Day et al.\n15\n is relatively smaller. The compressive stress in x- and y-direction initially experiences a larger increase with pressure, and therefore, the coal permeability decreases. As the pressure increases, the increase of stress slows down and the fracture pressure elevates and reopen the fracture. This leads to a recovery of the coal permeability.\nThe permeability data tested under constant confining stress were collected to calibrate the model predictions since these experiments involve constant stress boundary. These data were collected from works\n45\n\n,\n\n47\n\n,\n\n57\u201360\n and plotted in Fig. 17\n. It can be seen although the experimental permeability ratios may increase or decrease with pressure, they fall within a lower bound and an upper one. The permeability evolution trends of coals predicted by the proposed model (Figs. 15 and 16) are consistent with experimental measurements, indicating the reliability of the proposed model.\n\nCase 3 Plane strain condition\n\n\n\nCoal seams are usually horizontal or sub-horizontal, and are confined by much harder and thicker rock strata on the top and on the floor. Thus, the predominant deformation occurs in the horizonal direction. The vertical deformation, therefore, can be constrained, i.e.\n\n(36)\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\nz\nz\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nInserting equation (36) into equation (10) gives:\n\n(37)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nz\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\nv\n\nx\nz\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\nx\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\nE\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\nv\n\ny\nz\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ne\ny\ny\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\nE\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy assuming that the external stresses in x- and y-direction are constant, the changes in effective stress acting on fractures can be expressed as:\n\n(38)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nx\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\ny\ny\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nb\nf\n\n\u0394\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(39)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3\n\nz\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\nv\n\nx\nz\n\n\n\n\nE\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nE\nz\n\n\nv\n\ny\nz\n\n\n\n\nE\ny\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\nb\n\u0394\np\n\u2212\n\nb\nm\n\n\u0394\n\np\nm\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoal permeability can be obtained by substitution of equations (38) and (39) into equation (19). Similar to uniaxial conditions, the coal permeability evolution is also influenced by mechanical properties of coal. Because the Young's modulus in the vertical direction is generally smaller than that in the horizonal direction and the Poisson's ratio cannot surpass 0.5. Therefore, gas pressure and adsorption-induced swelling could result in an increase of compression stress in the vertical direction.\n\nFig. 18\n shows the varied trend of coal permeability in all directions as pressure increases, the mechanical properties of coal from Pan and Connell\n16\n are used in calculation of coal permeability. Compared to the continuous increase of permeability shown in Fig. 15, the permeability in the plane strain model decreases initially with pressure, due to displacement constrain in vertical stress. However, the swelling is slow when gas pressure is larger, and the increased pressure can reopen the fracture, which leads to the rebound of coal permeability. Compared to the experimental results shown in Fig. 17, the predicted permeability evolution is similar to experiment results.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, an adsorption-induced anisotropic coal swelling and permeability model is presented. The model is developed by combining gas adsorption thermodynamics with anisotropic material properties. A stress-dependent directional permeability model is proposed to represent the anisotropy of coal permeability, in which a direction-related fracture compressibility factor is incorporated. A weakening coefficient is introduced to estimate the impact of gas adsorption on fracture compressibility. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed model are examined via a series of validation exercises against laboratory coal swelling and permeability data along with comparisons between presented and existing models. In all cases, the model predictions exhibit good agreement with the experimental data. The major findings are summarized as follows:\n\n(1)\nGas adsorption induced coal swelling in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane is greater than that in the parallel plane. Fracture compressibility may increase due to coal-gas interaction and CO2 can cause a larger increase in fracture compressibility compared to CH4 and N2.\n\n\n(2)\nAlthough coal permeability in any direction can be influenced by the stress changes in all directions, permeability parallel to the bedding plane is more sensitive to stress changes than that of the perpendicular to the bedding plane, especially change in stress perpendicular to the bedding plane.\n\n\n(3)\nUnder constant volume condition, coal permeability drops significantly and no rebound was observed, however, coal permeability may rebound with pressure increase under uniaxial strain condition and plane strain condition. Anisotropic swelling and mechanical properties of coal can affect coal permeability anisotropy.\n\n\n(4)\nThe decrease of coal permeability in direction parallel bedding plane is more significant than that in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane.\n\n\n\n\n","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"","73":"","74":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nChalk is characterised by soft plastic and brittle properties and the exploitation of chalk reservoirs results in wellbore instability, reservoir and overburden deformation, and seafloor subsidence.\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n The field-scale deformations have important economic and societal impacts leading to, for instance, the temporary cessation and the drastic reduction of hydrocarbon production in the Tyra field for platform rebuild and in the Groningen field for safety reasons, respectively. Geomechanical models for chalk reservoirs were developed during the last three decades in order to predict rock deformation along wells and at the field scale so that suitable field development plans can be implemented to minimize risks.\n3\u201310\n Besides, chalk deformation associated with pressure depletion modifies the rock physics and stress state, which in turn alter the travel times of seismic waves measured in subsurface including the overburden and reservoir.\n11\u201314\n Quantitative insights on the mechanical response of chalk under different in situ conditions are thus of primary importance for accurate field monitoring such as 4D seismic survey.\nCapturing the mechanical behaviour of chalk for building reliable geomechanical models requires the constitutive models to be calibrated against experimental data. Most of the experimental studies are indirectly or directly related to clean (i.e. mainly composed of calcite) chalk from the Upper Tor Fm. of Maastrichtian age that represents the main reservoir unit in the North Sea.\n15\n Firstly, the mechanical properties of analogue outcrop chalk from Europe and USA were assessed due to a limited access to reservoir core material.\n16\u201320\n The outcomes of these studies in terms of elastic moduli, and yield and shear failure stresses were considered relevant to describe the deformation behaviour of Maastrichtian chalk from different hydrocarbon fields.\n21\n Secondly, to a less extent, triaxial tests were reported on core specimens from, for instance, the Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Hod, Valhall, Tyra and South Arne fields. A dataset was built over the years to quantify the geomechanical properties of Maastrichtian chalk for a wide range of porosity and to reconstruct, in a mean-deviatoric stress (\n\n\np\nm\n,\n\n\n \u2212\n\nq\n\n) plot, its yield surface that is composed of the shear failure line and the end cap.\n22\n\n,\n\n23\n Whereas the shear failure line separates the elastic and brittle regime, the end cap defines the stress conditions at the onset of plastic deformation. In comparison, the relationships between the geomechanical, petrophysical and lithological properties of Danian chalk deposits from the Ekofisk Fm. that contain a higher insoluble residue content (quartz and clay) than the overlying Tor Fm. are rather scarce.\n24\n A part of the oil-bearing chalk interval in the North Sea fields is however located in the Ekofisk Fm., and its characterisation in terms of reservoir properties is thus relevant for engineers. At the scale of the Danish North Sea, the average thickness of this formation represents a third of that of the Tor Fm.,\n25\n and, although less than in the Tor Fm., the Ekofisk Fm. contains a significant amount of hydrocarbon reserves within major hydrocarbon fields such as the Tyra, Dan, Halfdan, Gorm, and Kraka fields.\n26\n\n,\n\n27\n\n\nA unified chalk model was built by combining results from uniaxial compaction, hydrostatic compaction and shear failure tests collected on Danian and Maastrichtian rock in an attempt to fill the knowledge gap in Danian chalk and to average the deformation behaviour of both stratigraphic formations.\n10\n However, the mineralogical composition and the abundance of discontinuities, such as stylolites and fractures, can vary significantly between the sediments from the two stratigraphic formations.\n28\u201332\n On the one hand, Danian deposits are characterised by a significant insoluble residue content that increases as porosity declines. On the other hand, chalk of Maastrichtian age can display abundant stylolites and stylolite-associated fractures. Such differences in the lithology and integrity of the rock have fundamental impacts on geomechanics. Whereas a high silica content strengthens the deformation response of the rock, a softening trend is reported for chalk containing discontinuities.\n17\n\n,\n\n33\n\n,\n\n34\n Knowledge acquired from tests on Maastrichtian chalk may therefore not be directly transferable to Danian rock. Experimental studies focused specifically on Danian chalk are necessary to study its mechanical properties and, ultimately, quantify its contribution to total reservoir compaction. A key question to address here is whether or not the constitutive relations established for Maastrichtian chalk can be used for Danian chalk.\nIn this context, our study aims at assessing the mechanical behaviour of Danian chalk with various amount of quartz in its rock fabric thanks to an extensive experimental dataset from the Joint Chalk Research library (JCR). Using hydrostatic compaction, shear failure, and unconfined compressive strength tests on oil-saturated specimens, the yield stresses, i.e., the stress at which plastic deformation is initiated, and the Mohr-Coulomb criteria (friction angle \u03c6 and rock cohesion \n\nC\n\n) are quantified across a 30\u201345% porosity range. A comparison between the mechanical properties of Danian chalk reported in the present study and those previously documented on Maastrichtian rock is carried out and the factors controlling the observed differences are discussed.\n\n\n2\nBackground knowledge\nContrary to the Maastrichtian chalk, the deposits from the Ekofisk Fm. in the Danish North Sea contain a non-negligible insoluble residue content, especially towards the base of the formation.\n30\n The clay assemblage consists of smectite, illite, kaolinite and chlorite. Whereas chlorite is a product of diagenesis, and smectite and illite are likely detrital in origin, petrographic analysis shows that kaolinite can be both diagenetic and detrital in origin.\n29,31,35\n On the other hand, quartz mainly consists of spheres ca. 50\u00a0nm in diameter that form larger aggregates of micro-quartz present in pore space.\n29\n The micro-quartz formed during diagenesis by the dissolution and precipitation of siliceous organisms that were deposited on the seafloor together with calcareous organisms such as coccolithophores. Thus, the quartz\/calcite ratio can in theory reflect variations in the proportion of siliceous and calcareous organisms deposited on the seafloor, while the amount of clay that is both diagenetic and depositional in origin, should record a rather ambiguous signal. The mineralogical analyses of chalk from two Danish North Sea reservoirs (Kraka and South Arne fields) showing a linear relationship between calcite and quartz content, and a data scattering when plotting calcite vs clay content support this hypothesis.\n28\n Furthermore, Fig. 1\na shows the correlation between the amount of quartz and calcite for Danian chalk samples with a low clay content (below 4%) and collected within various North Sea fields. The clay-free chalk from the Ekofisk Fm. displays a clear linear correlation suggesting that the measured amount of quartz in the clay-free lithology is directly proportional to the ratio between the amount of siliceous vs calcareous organisms accumulated on the seafloor during time of deposition. Besides, micro-quartz reduces porosity by precipitating in pores and this porosity deterioration is observed in Fig. 1b. The porosity decline of clay-free chalk comes along with an increase in quartz content. This latter trend is associated with a scattering of the datapoints caused primarily by the change in the degree of calcite cementation between two clay-free Danian chalk samples with a similar quartz content.\n28\n To conclude, the decline in the porosity of clay-free chalk from the Ekofisk Fm. appears inherently linked to a progressive rise in quartz content.\n\n\n3\nData set and methodology\n\n3.1\nMaterials and test procedures\nA total of 20 triaxial tests carried out on Danian chalk are reviewed in the present study. This database was collected and archived by the JCR group (http:\/\/jointchalkresearch.org\/) between 1971 and 2005 with most of the tests carried out after 1991 (Table 1\n). Performed at room temperature, the experiments assessed the yield stresses and shear properties of reservoir chalk specimens with a porosity ranging between 30% and 45%. The visual inspection of the specimens indicate that the core material is representative of flawless pelagic sediments. Test results collected on specimens with defects (stylolites, fractures, extraclasts, intraclasts) were rejected during the data screening process. The mineralogical composition is estimated by X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 2\n). The tested samples are mainly composed of calcite and quartz with a minor clay content below 4% except for the specimen labelled 336 that contains 15.7% clay (Table 1). The tested specimens are classified in two categories, clean (<3% quartz content) and impure (>4% quartz content) chalk (Fig. 2). Importantly, the quartz content of the impure lithology declines progressively with increasing porosity and above 40% porosity, its quartz content does not exceed 4% as observed in Danish North Sea fields (Fig. 1b). Besides, the selected core samples belong to four hydrocarbon reservoirs from the Danish and Norwegian sector of the North Sea, the Dan, South Arne, Ekofisk and Tor fields. All tested specimens were not cleaned and fully saturated with crude oil or light laboratory oil such as Exxol-D60 and Isopar-L. Previous experimental results from \n22\n were also integrated in the present study to fill the gap in the dataset on the shear properties. A friction angle and rock cohesion value of 0.48\u00a0rad and 1.4\u00a0MPa on the one hand and 0.85 and 4.6\u00a0MPa on the other hand were assigned to Danian chalk with a 45% and 34% porosity, respectively.\nThe selected laboratory tests are referred to as short-term experiments (few hours long) during which the two radial stresses (\u03c3\n\n2\n and \u03c3\n\n3\n) are kept equal. The maximum principal stress is noted \u03c3\n\n1\n. The sign convention for stress is positive for compression. Three categories of tests can be identified. Firstly, hydrostatic compaction tests characterised by effective isotropic stress (\u03c3\n\n1\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3\n\n2\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3\n\n3\n) document the stress values at the pore collapse (Fig. 3\na). Some of these tests were interrupted prior to reach a linear plastic trend and thus only the stress at the onset of pore collapse could be quantified. Secondly, the shear failure stresses are measured during two-step triaxial tests that consist of an initial hydrostatic or uniaxial loading\/unloading in the elastic domain of the tested specimens (Fig. 3b). During the second step, \u03c3\n\n1\n is increased while maintaining \u03c3\n\n2\n and \u03c3\n\n3\n constant. The radial stresses range between 1.8\u00a0MPa and 13.2\u00a0MPa amongst the shear failure tests. Unconfined compressive strength tests are characterised by the absence of applied radial stress (\u03c3\n\n2\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3\n\n3\n\u00a0=\u00a00) during loading along \u03c3\n\n1\n. The axial and radial strains were measured during experiments by a linear variable displacement transducer and two strain gauges, respectively. Strain rate are similar among experiments.\nTo estimate the yield stresses of both clean and impure Danian chalk, the stress-strain curves were plotted and the initial (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n), and final effective yield stresses (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n) were obtained by measuring the stress, at which the assumed linear elastic and plastic trends diverge from the stress-strain curve, as shown in Fig. 3a. The representative effective yield stress (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\ny\n.\nr\ne\np\n.\n\n\n\n) corresponds to the perpendicular projection to the tangent of the stress-strain curve from the intersection point of the elastic and plastic trends. Under hydrostatic conditions, the effective yield stresses are noted \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nr\ne\np\n.\n\n\n\n, and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n. Furthermore, the shear failure of impure chalk was identified by a drop in stresses sustained by the specimen along the stress-strain curve during loading (Fig. 3b). The stress condition at the onset of stress drop is referred to as the shear failure stress. The shear failure tests listed in Table 1 are grouped into three porosity classes (30%\u201332.5%, 35%\u201337.5% and 37.5%\u201340% porosity class) to reconstruct the Mohr-Coulomb failure line of impure Danian chalk in a \n\n\np\nm\n,\n\n\n-\n\nq\n\n plot (Fig. 3c). A linear fitting curve is applied to the data set to estimate the \u03c6 and \n\nC\n\n values as follow:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c6\n=\n\nsin\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n3\n\nM\n\n\n6\n+\nM\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nC\n=\n\n\nb\n\n\n(\n\n3\n\u2212\nsin\n\n\u03c6\n\n)\n\n\n\n6\n\ncos\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nb\n\n is the intersection between the shear failure line and the \n\nq\n\n-axis, \n\nM\n\n determines the slope of the shear failure line in \n\n\np\nm\n,\n\n\n-\n\nq\n\n plots, \n\nC\n\n represents the rock cohesion, and \u03c6 is the angle of internal friction.\nThe uncertainty associated with the data fitting carried out in the present study were also quantified. To this purpose, a 95% confidence interval was estimated for each reported trend between porosity and yield stresses, \u03c6, and \n\nC\n\n. Finally, the plastic and shear properties of Maastrichtian chalk used for comparison purposes were extracted from .\n23\n They have applied a similar methodology to calculate the yield stresses, \u03c6 and \n\nC\n\n, and have studied experimental data collected under similar laboratory conditions in terms of temperature, saturating fluid, and strain rate, thereby allowing accurate comparisons.\n\n\n3.2\nModelling the yield surface\nThe experimental results collected on the plastic and shear properties of oil-saturated impure Danian chalk enable the reconstruction of the initial yield surface for a 30\u201345% porosity range prior to any irreversible deformation. The yield surface is composed of the shear failure line and end cap, which define the stress conditions at the onset of brittle and plastic deformation, respectively. The authors have used a modified Mohr-Coulomb yield function \n\nF\n\n(\n\n\np\nm\n\u2032\n\n,\n\nJ\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n developed by \n46\n that captures simultaneously the shear failure line determined by the angle of friction angle and the tensile strength and the end cap thanks to the hydrostatic yield stress and the \n\nm\n\n parameter.

The experimental data on clean chalk shows that the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n ranges from 39.5\u00a0MPa for the less porous specimens to 16.8\u00a0MPa for the highly porous counterparts, while the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n spans from 51.6\u00a0MPa down to 24.2\u00a0MPa. Despite the relatively scattering of points as indicated by the 95% confidence interval, the coefficients of determination (R\n\n2\n) equal to 0.98 and indicate that the fitting functions represent a good approximation of the laboratory data for the initial, representative and final yield stresses. Besides, the results constrain the transition zone between the elastic and plastic domain that is delimitated by the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n. The stress interval at the transition zone equals 7\u00a0MPa for the most porous chalk and increases to 12\u00a0MPa for specimens with a 34% porosity. In addition, impure chalk lithology displays an overall stronger plastic behaviour than their counterparts with a lower amount of quartz. The \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n reaches 43.8\u00a0MPa at a 35.5% porosity. This represents a 20% increase in the stress at the onset of pore collapse compared with clean chalk. As porosity increases above 38%, the plastic behaviour of both groups of chalk becomes similar despite a difference in quartz content as observed between 38% and 40% porosity (Fig. 4).\n\n\n4.2\nMohr-Coulomb criteria (Danian chalk)\nThe Mohr-Coulomb criteria are only estimated based on impure specimens with a high quartz content due to a lack of experimental data on clean chalk (Fig. 5\n). Below 40% porosity, one single specimen contains a low quartz content equal to 2%. The angle of friction is plotted versus porosity and an inverse correlation is observed (Fig. 5). For oil-saturated specimens, \u03c6 decreases from ca. 0. 8\u00a0rad (46\u00b0) to 0.45\u00a0rad (26\u00b0) as porosity increases from 30% to 45%. Despite the relatively large interval covered by the 95% confidence interval, the data set displays a coherent trend with a R\n\n2\n value equal to 0.6. Similarly, \n\nC\n\n values rise as porosity declines. According to the correlation function, for 31.25% porosity chalk, \n\nC\n\n equal to 7.5\u00a0MPa and falls to 1.4\u00a0MPa at the highest porosity, thereby indicating a softening trend. The data points are coherent between each other as shown by the high R\n\n2\n value equal to 0.78. Thus, the results on the two Mohr-Coulomb criteria of impure Danian chalk are similar pointing out a stronger behaviour of low porosity rock subject to shear failure. The functions between the Mohr-Coulomb criteria and porosity follow an exponential trend as for \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\n\n\n\n (Eq. (4)). The constants A and B are listed in Table 3\n.\n\n\n4.3\nComparison between Danian and Maastrichtian chalk\n\n4.3.1\nPore collapse\n\nFig. 6\na shows the porosity-dependency of the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n for clean Danian and Maastrichtian chalk saturated with oil at room temperature. Firstly, for the stresses at the onset of pore collapse (i.e., \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n), it is observed that highly porous (>40% porosity), Danian and Maastrichtian specimens display a similar plastic behaviour. The \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n rises from ca. 12.5\u00a0MPa\u201320\u00a0MPa as porosity declines. However, towards lower porosity values, the onset of pore collapse of Danian chalk occurs at higher stress conditions than for the Maastrichtian counterparts. For instance, at 34% porosity, the specimens from the Tor Fm. start deforming plastically at 34\u00a0MPa hydrostatic stress, which is 8\u00a0MPa lower than the estimated \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n for clean chalk from the Ekofisk Fm. corresponding to a 20% reduction in pore collapse stress. For \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n, Danian chalk also displays the stiffest mechanical behaviour and the difference in the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n values grows towards low porosities (Fig. 6a). The maximum difference in the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n values between clean Maastrichtian and Danian chalk reaches 11.5\u00a0MPa at 32% porosity (Fig. 6a). Thus, the plastic behaviour of Danian chalk with a low quartz content progressively differs from that of the clean Maastrichtian counterpart as porosity decreases. The porosity trend of the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n is also reconstructed for impure Danian chalk that appears as the strongest lithology (Fig. 6b). The contrast in plastic behaviour is initiated at 38\u201340% porosity and rises steadily as porosity declines. For instance, at 35% porosity, the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n increases from 37.4\u00a0MPa to 46.5\u00a0MPa when the quartz content of Danian chalk shifts from 1.3% to 24.5% (Figs. 4b and 6b). Furthermore, it is noticed that the stress range of the elastic to plastic transition zone for both clean Danian and Maastrichtian rocks and delimitated by \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\nf\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n widens with decreasing porosity (Fig. 6a). This widening is more pronounced for specimens from the Tor Fm. In more details, the stress range separating the elastic and plastic regime of Maastrichtian chalk rises from 2\u00a0MPa to 12\u00a0MPa across the 32\u201344% porosity range studied, whereas that of the clean Danian chalk spans from 6.6\u00a0MPa to 14\u00a0MPa. Note that, different at high porosity values, the width of the elastic to plastic transition zone becomes similar (12\u201314\u00a0MPa) between both clean chalk types towards the less porous specimens.\n\n\n4.3.2\nMohr-Coulomb criteria\nThe values of the Mohr-Coulomb criteria measured in impure Danian chalk and clean Maastrichtian chalk with a low quartz content are here compared (Fig. 7\n). Firstly, the \u03c6 values for both Danian and Maastrichtian chalk display an exponential trend with porosity. As porosity increases from 30% to 45%, the angle of friction decreases from ca. 0.8\u00a0rad (46\u00b0) to 0.45\u00a0rad (26\u00b0) for the Danian specimens, whereas for the Maastrichtian rock, it ranges between 0.73\u00a0rad (42\u00b0) and 0.5\u00a0rad (28.6\u00b0). Both trends intersect at 38% porosity, at which the contrast in strength between Danian and Maastrichtian chalk reverses. The \n\nC\n\n values also display an exponential trend with porosity for both types of chalk. For the Maastrichtian chalk, \n\nC\n\n ranges from 3.3\u00a0MPa at low porosity to 1\u00a0MPa as porosity reaches 45%. The \n\nC\n\n values of Danian chalk are similar to that of the Maastrichtian specimens at high porosity above 40%. Nevertheless, a difference in the Mohr-Coulomb criterion is observed towards less porous specimens. In more details, at 30% porosity, the \n\nC\n\n values of Danian chalk are twice that of the Maastrichtian counterparts, reaching 7.5\u00a0MPa. Importantly, the 95% confidence intervals of the two Mohr-Coulomb criteria overlap each other as shown in Fig. 7. Thus, care is needed when reporting differences in the shear properties of chalk from the Tor and Ekofisk Fm. as the confidence intervals indicate that the \u03c6 and \n\nC\n\n values of both chalk types are statistically similar. However, two recurrent contrasts between Maastrichtian and Danian chalk can be observed. Firstly, the slopes of the porosity trends for \u03c6 and \n\nC\n\n of impure Danian chalk are systematically steeper than for the Maastrichtian samples. Secondly, the shear properties of Danian chalk seem to be consistently higher than that of the Maastrichtian samples towards low porosity specimens. Thus, the test results tend to indicate that i) impure chalk from the Ekofisk Fm. is stiffer than that of the Tor Fm., especially for porosity below 38\u201340% and ii) the porosity-dependent strengthening of \u03c6 and \n\nC\n\n is more pronounced for Danian specimens.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nRecrystallisation and cementation\nThe assessment of the plastic and shear properties of subsurface chalk indicates a mechanical contrast between clean specimens from the Ekofisk and Tor formations. Danian chalk appears stronger than the Maastrichtian counterparts during hydrostatic tests and this difference increases slightly as porosity declines (Fig. 6a). The rock lithification and the resulting strengthening of the rock fabric of clean chalk that can explain this contrast consists of two diagenetic processes, calcite recrystallisation and cementation.\n36\n The recrystallisation involves a local redistribution of calcite during burial from less stable surfaces such as grain-to-grain contacts to more stable adjacent surfaces resulting in the formation of contact cement that strengthens the pore walls.\n37\n The result of recrystallisation is smoother calcite grains and, thus, measurements of the specific surface that represents the area of the particle-pore interface in a given volume of rock were used as a proxy to assess the degree of recrystallisation between samples with a similar porosity.\n35\n\n,\n\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n These studies systematically show a higher specific surface values in the Danian specimens than in the Maastrichtian specimens. According to this observation, chalk from the Ekofisk Fm. should have undergone a less pronounced recrystallisation of its rock fabric and thus, should display the softest mechanical properties, thereby contradicting the present results. Nevertheless, the laboratory data on the specific surface were collected on impure Danian chalk (<90% of calcite) and on clean Maastrichtian specimens (>94% calcite). Knowing that the quartz and clay minerals (5\u201360\u00a0m2\/g) have a higher specific surface than calcite (0.5\u20133.5\u00a0m2\/g),\n40\n the reported difference in the particle-pore surface areas between both chalks is influenced by the mineralogical contrast between the studied specimens. Therefore, there is a lack of direct observations demonstrating a contrast in the degree of recrystallisation between clean chalk from the Ekofisk and Tor Fms at a given porosity in the North Sea. The cementation is another chemical process that can strengthen the rock fabric by precipitation of calcite cement in pores and around pre-existing grains. Exhaustive image analysis studies of >100 thin-sections of reservoir samples from the North Sea (Ekofisk, Valhall, South Arne, Dan and Tyra fields) have demonstrated that rocks from the Ekofisk Fm. display a higher amount of large grains (>316\u00a0\u03bcm2) than its counterpart from the Tor Fm.\n41\n\n,\n\n42\n These large grains are microfossils containing intraparticle porosity that are partially to fully cemented by calcite. This additional amount of calcite cement within Danian chalk can explain its stronger mechanical behaviour under hydrostatic loading.\n\n\n5.2\nMineralogy\nThe experimental results display a consistent trend in the mechanical response of clean and impure Danian chalk during hydrostatic compaction tests (Figs. 4b and 6b). Similar for highly porous specimens (>40% porosity), the values of \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n suggest a strengthening of chalk containing quartz towards low porosity. In more details, at 35% porosity, the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n increases from 37.4\u00a0MPa to 46.5\u00a0MPa between clean and impure chalk. These observations is likely caused by the contrast in the mineralogical composition of the tested specimens. The specimens collected from the impure chalk lithology display a quartz content up to 24.5% at 35% porosity (Fig. 4b). Contrary, the quartz content of clean Danian specimens does not exceed 2.6%. More importantly, the difference in the mineralogical composition becomes significant below 38\u201340% porosity, which corresponds to the porosity threshold below which the porosity-trend of the yield stress of clean and impure chalk diverges. In the rock matrix, the quartz consists of \u03bcm-sized aggregates of nano-spheres mainly located in intergranular and intercrystalline porosity. These aggregates form during early burial by the dissolution, and later precipitation, of siliceous skeletons of radiolarians, diatoms, and sponges.\n43\n Importantly, the micro-quartz bridges individual calcite grains, thereby strengthening the bulk rock and explaining the reported results.\n33\n Note that towards high porosity above 40%, the quartz as well as the clay content of Danian chalk from the North Sea is commonly low (Fig. 1b).\n28,30,35\n The mineralogy between both impure and clean chalk lithologies becomes similar and mainly composed of calcite. This is why the dataset for impure and clean chalk contains the same clean specimen with a 42.3% porosity and labelled File Nb. 426 (Table 1).\nThe plastic and shear properties of clean Maastrichtian and impure Danian chalk are also compared (Figs. 6b and 7). Despite the different porosity range investigated for the yield stress (32%\u201344%) and Mohr-Coulomb criteria (30%\u201345%), a consistent trend is observed in their mechanical responses during hydrostatic compaction and shear failure tests. Relatively similar for highly porous specimens (>40% porosity), the values of \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n and of the angle of friction and the effective rock cohesion suggest a stronger mechanical behaviour of impure Danian chalk compared with clean Maastrichtian specimens towards low porosity. Whereas the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n of Danian chalk with a 34% porosity is ca. 60% higher than that of the Maastrichtian chalk, the \u03c6 and \n\nC\n\n values of specimens with a 30% porosity are 25% and 50% higher than that of the specimens from the Tor Fm., respectively. The divergence in the deformation behaviour between both chalk types occurs at ca. 38\u201340% porosity, which corresponds to the porosity threshold below which the quartz content of impure chalk typically exceeds 4.4% (up to 57% at 31% porosity) while that of the Maastrichtian barely exceeds 2.6%. This observation indicates that despite the difference in the mechanical properties between these two chalk lithologies being a combination of calcite cementation and mineralogy, the quartz content appears as the primary factor explaining the mechanical contrasts between reservoir chalk from the Ekofisk and Tor Fms.\nFurthermore, previous studies have shown that the change in the mineralogical composition between the Ekofisk and Tor Fm. reported in the present study represents a regional trend at the scale of the North Sea\n15\n\n,\n\n30\n (Fig. 1). Whereas Maastrichtian deposits are characterised by a low quartz content rarely exceeding 5%,\n44\n\n,\n\n45\n the Ekofisk Fm. displays a high lithological heterogeneity. The mineralogical analyses of Danian chalk from North Sea fields with a ca. 30% porosity shown that the quartz content spans between 5% and 67% with the bulk of the data ranging between 5% and 20% \n28\n\n,\n\n29\n\n,\n\n31\n\n,\n\n35\n (Fig. 1b). In the present study, the amount of quartz in the tested specimens with a ca. 30% porosity equal to 56\u201357% (Fig. 2), thereby belonging to the upper end of the quartz content measured in Danian chalk. Recalling that quartz contributes to strengthen the rock matrix, the magnitude of the shear and plastic strengthening observed from clean Maastrichtian to impure Danian chalk (Figs. 6b and 7) likely represents the maximum difference that can be observed between both chalk types. Considering typical Danian chalk with a 30% porosity and an up to 20% quartz content, the authors believe that this rock strengthening, although observable, may be less pronounced than reported in the present study.\n\n\n5.3\nThe yield surface\nThe reconstructed yield surface of the impure Danian chalk is compared with that of the clean Maastrichtian chalk (Fig. 8\n). The input functions for \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n and \u03c6 of chalk from the Ekofisk and Tor Fms are extracted from Figs. 6 and 7, and inserted in the yield function (Eq. (3)). Besides, an exhaustive database from Brazil tests on reservoir chalk from the North Sea is used to estimate the tensile strength of the rocks in Eq. (3).\n47\n The porosity (\n\n\u03a6\n\n) dependent input functions for the tensile strength (\n\n\nP\nt\n\n\n) are \n\n\nP\nt\n\n=\n13.9\n\ne\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n5.1\n\n\u03a6\n\n)\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nP\nt\n\n=\n7.5\n\ne\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n5.3\n\n\u03a6\n\n)\n\n\n\n for the Danian and Maastrichtian rocks, respectively. Between 42.5% and 45% porosity, the locus of the shear failure line and the end cap in the \n\n\np\nm\n\u2032\n\n\n-\n\nq\n\n plot is similar between the specimens collected in the Ekofisk and Tor Fms. (Fig. 8). The maximum value of the deviatoric stress along the surfaces is ca. 8.6\u00a0MPa and the maximum mean stress equals 15.3\u00a0MPa for the Danian chalk and is slightly reduced to 13.6\u00a0MPa for the Maastrichtian counterparts. Towards lower porosities, the reported contrast in the porosity trends of the \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nh\ny\n.\ni\nn\n.\n\n\n\n and \u03c6 between both types of chalk (Figs. 6b and 7) leads to a larger area covered by the yield surface of chalk from the Ekofisk Fm. and, thus, a stronger deformation behaviour compared with that of the Maastrichtian rock. For instance, the mechanical properties of the impure Danian specimens with a 40% and 37.5% porosity are similar to that of the clean Maastrichtian chalk with a 37.5% and 35% porosity, respectively (Fig. 8). In most of the chalk reservoirs from the North Sea, hydrocarbon accumulation is located in both the Tor and Ekofisk Fms.\n15\n\n,\n\n30\n The outcomes of this work can thus assist engineers and geologists in developing simulators that capture the specific mechanical behaviour of Danian rocks and improve prediction on the contribution of the Ekofisk Fm. to the total strain occurring in oil and gas fields from the North Sea.\nBesides, as part of the green energy transition, the economic viability of thermal energy and CO2 storage in onshore and offshore Denmark has been confirmed by feasibility studies.\n48\u201351\n These sectors of industry involve periodic injection\/production of fluids with various chemical composition and temperature in subsurface chalk of Maastrichtian and Danian age. The geomechanical alteration of chalk is expected to occur due to calcite and quartz dissolution by acidified carbonate water and by Mg-bearing fluids at high temperature (>90\u00a0\u00b0C).\n52\n\n,\n\n53\n Thus, among others, the quartz content plays a role in the alteration of chalk properties by controlling the fluid-calcite surface area available for chemo-mechanical interactions and by promoting rock compaction at high temperature. In the present study, the differences in the mechanical behaviour between Danian and Maastrichtian chalk with a high and low quartz content, respectively, are of significance changing the shear and plastic properties by a factor of 20%\u201360%. Further quantitative studies on the influence of quartz content on the geomechanical properties of chalk are thus required to provide a solid knowledge base, from which experimental and simulation studies can be carried out on the short- and long-term effects of CO2 and thermal energy storage on reservoir integrity.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThis study aims at quantitatively assessing and interpreting the contrast in the plastic and shear behaviour of reservoir chalk deposited in the Ekofisk and Tor Fms from the North Sea. To this purpose, a total of 20 triaxial tests, including hydrostatic compaction, shear failure and unconfined compression tests collected from the JCR database and carried out at room temperature on oil-saturated Danian chalk are investigated and compared with published data on Maastrichtian chalk. The studied specimens span from 30% to 45% porosity to cover the full spectrum of Danian chalk that is likely to deform plastically in a depleted field.\nThe main outcome of this study is that the constitutive relations established for Maastrichtian chalk and based on experimental studies cannot be used for Danian chalk. Firstly, the data obtained on the stress values at pore collapse show a systematic stronger mechanical behaviour of the clean and impure Danian chalk compared with the clean Maastrichtian counterparts for specimens with a porosity below 38\u201340%. Above this porosity threshold, the three chalk types tend to display similar stress conditions at the onset of plastic deformation. The strengthening of chalk from the Ekofisk Fm. below 38% porosity is more pronounced when specimens contain more than 4% quartz, thereby emphasizing the role of mineralogy on chalk geomechanics. Secondly, the friction angle and rock cohesion values are also higher for the Danian chalk containing >4% quartz than for the clean Maastrichtian specimens, especially towards low porosity below 38\u201340%. Porosity-dependent functions are extrapolated from these observed trends and proposed to estimate the hydrostatic yield stress and Mohr-Coulomb criteria of the impure and clean Danian chalk. Furthermore, the yield surface of chalk from the Ekofisk Fm. with a 30%\u201345% porosity range is reconstructed in a \n\n\np\nm\n\u2032\n\n\n-\n\nq\n\n-porosity graph and compared with that of the Maastrichtian chalk. This comparison indicates for instance that the yield surface and, thus, the mechanical properties of the impure Danian specimens with a 40% and 37.5% porosity are similar to that of Maastrichtian chalk with a 37.5% and 35% porosity, respectively. These differences in the shear and plastic behaviour are of significance during geomechanical simulation, modifying the onset and amount of deformation taking place in the Ekofisk and Tor Fms. of depleted reservoirs. The greater amount of quartz measured in the specimens from the Ekofisk Fm. is thought to primary control the observed mechanical contrast between Danian and Maastrichtian deposits. Cementation is also considered as a secondary parameter influencing this mechanical contrast.\nImportantly, the impure Danian specimens studied here contain up to 56% quartz, a value that is higher than the average 5\u201320% quartz content commonly reported in Danian chalk from the North Sea. Recalling that quartz contributes to strengthen the rock matrix, this study likely reports the maximum difference in the shear and plastic properties between impure and clean chalk from the Ekofisk and Tor Fms, respectively. The outcomes of this work can be integrated in constitutive models and assist engineers and geologists in developing geomechanical simulators that capture the specific mechanical behaviour of Danian and Maastrichtian rocks in the context of hydrocarbon exploitation as well as CO2 and energy storage.\n\n\nData availability statement\nAll geomechanics data used in this study are compiled in the JCR database and can be accessible upon registration from http:\/\/jointchalkresearch.org\/using the file numbers compiled in Table 1.\n\n\nCompeting interest statement\nNo potential competing interest is reported by the authors.\n\n","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":"","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nRock spalling is a type of stress-induced failure that occurs around deep excavation boundaries, in the absence of confining pressure. It often appears as rock splitting and flaky exfoliation in hard rocks, but can also manifest itself through shearing in weaker rocks.\n1\n Fairhurst and Cook\n2\n first described spalling failure as the development of extension fractures (Mode I) under compressive loading. A number of early field studies\n3\n\n,\n\n4\n have concluded that the direction in which spalling failure propagates is generally along that of the minimum compressive stress, and the final breakout can have different shapes such as \u201cdog ear\u201d or \u201ccusp\u201d,\n5\n as shown in Fig.\u00a01.\n\nOver the past few decades, spalling type failure leading to the development of V-shaped breakouts has been observed to occur at the centimetre scale in field studies involving deep underground experimental tunnels and boreholes, such as the Mine-by experiment tunnel run by the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) Underground Research Laboratory\n7\n and the \u00c4sp\u00f6 Pillar Stability Experiment (APSE) conducted in the Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) in Sweden.\n8\n Several failure mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of the spalled zone. Santarelli and Brown\n9\n and Haimson and Song\n10\n proposed that the failure mechanisms by which breakouts occur are different depending on the rock rheology. In hard rocks, spalling results from tensile fractures that initiate parallel to the borehole wall, while in weaker rocks it initiates at the borehole boundary and develops through shearing. Shen and Barton\n11\n emphasise that spalling may be the starting point of a breakout, but tensile failure is restricted to the immediate vicinity of an underground free surface, where extensional strain regime exists. Spalling has also been observed to occur in drilling experiments on centimetre scale cores for different rock types, including granites, limestones, and sandstones.\n12\n\n\n\n1.1\nReview of existing numerical models\nNumerical methods for simulating rock fracturing can be divided into three main categories: continuum, discontinuum, and hybrid methods. Several spalling models have been implemented using continuum numerical methods and conventional plasticity theory. \n1\n Hajiabdolmajid et al.\n13\n\n,\n\n14\n concluded that conventional constitutive laws such as elastic perfectly-plastic or elastic brittle\u2013plastic cannot replicate the shape and depth of the spalled zone in strong rocks. The reason proposed for this is that in the conventional Mohr\u2013Coulomb and Hoek\u2013Brown criteria, the strength components (cohesion and friction angle) are assumed to be mobilised simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, Hajiabdolmajid et al.\n13\n proposed modified versions of the Mohr\u2013Coulomb and Hoek\u2013Brown criteria, in which the cohesive and frictional strength components are functions of the accumulated plastic strain. Similarly, Diederichs\n15\n used a cohesion-weakening frictional strengthening model with modified Hoek\u2013Brown parameters to develop the Damage Initiation Spalling Limit (DISL) criterion.\nTherefore, when implementing continuum approaches to model rock spalling, a modified constitutive criterion is usually required to capture the brittle rock response.\n13\u201316\n While the cohesion weakening friction strengthening (CWFS) criterion used in continuum approaches generates results in agreement with the field observations, it requires an\u00a0a priori estimation of the plastic strain limits at which the cohesion component reaches its residual value and the frictional component becomes fully mobilised. Martin\n17\n also highlights that the existing numerical studies using continuum methods can only provide an approximation of the fracturing process, which is inherently discrete. Another set of methods suitable for modelling borehole failure are the discontinuum numerical methods. Cundall\n18\n provided a detailed account of discrete element methods (DEM) and their implementations, alongside their applicability in modeling discrete fracture initiation and growth.\nAn advantage of the discrete element method is that it does not depend on the previously mentioned constitutive criteria to define the fracturing process. Instead, particle contact \n19\n is used to replicate brittle failure. The domain is discretised, each particle contact given a local, micro\u2013strength and when the tensile or shear strength at the contact is overcome, it breaks. The progressive micro\u2013failure process continues with subsequent bonds breaking, which then results in a stress redistribution around the domain and eventual macro\u2013failure. A disadvantage of this method is that the given particle contact strengths, as well as particle shapes, sizes and clustering are not geomechanically informed, and so the accuracy of the fracture process cannot be verified.\nNumerical studies using discontinuum methods showed that micro-scale heterogeneity \n20\n, grain interlocking \n21\n, and grain clustering \n22\n are important factors involved in tensile failure in hard, brittle rocks such as granites. Lan et al.\n20\n introduced the effect of small scale heterogeneities in a grain-based model, using the discrete element method (DEM). Polygonal grains of variable sizes were bonded together through contacts that accounted for the micro heterogeneity, but also allowed simulation of intra-element fracturing. Using a heterogeneous approach, Lan et al.\n23\n and Elmo and Stead\n24\n reproduced the depth and shape of spalling around the APSE pillar, and pillar strength, emphasising the importance of both grain-scale and large-scale heterogeneity in modeling borehole spalling.\nThe suitability of using a combined finite\/discrete element method (FDEM) in order to simulate brittle fracturing has been investigated in several studies.\n25\u201329\n This method is based on modelling fracture and damage processes explicitly, in order to simulate the transition from a continuous to a discontinuous domain, and hence replicate the fracture initiation and propagation more accurately. Vlachopoulos and Vazaios \n25\n recently simulated spalling damage using a combined finite\u2013discrete element method (FDEM) in their model, and compared their results with the continuum DISL approach. Using the FDEM method, they were capable of simulating fracture initiation, coalescence, and propagation in two dimensions, as progressively larger stresses were applied to the borehole. Whereas discrete and hybrid methods have been shown to predict the spalled zone accurately to some extent, fracture growth is restricted to occur only along pre-existing element boundaries, where contact strength is initially assigned. In contrast, when fractures grow in geological media, their development influences the stress field in the vicinity of the crack, thereby affecting the fracture growth trajectories and the final fracture patterns, which end up being different from the predicted path.\nThe present study differs from those described above, as it investigates spalling in three dimensions, and applies a first-principle geometric fracture growth approach to model spalling\/failure patterns. Fractures are modelled as distinct and explicit entities, and the volumetric discretisation of the rock domain is updated at every growth step to accommodate the evolving fracture geometry. Section\u00a02 provides a comprehensive description of the methodology used.\n\n\n1.2\nThe nuclear waste context\nDeep underground disposal is widely considered one of the safer options for long-term disposal of nuclear waste. This type of disposal is based on a \u201cmultiple barrier concept\u201d,\n30\n which introduces several protective layers between the disused fuel and the environment\/society. There are several on-going projects, at different completion stages, which investigate the engineered (e.g.\u00a0type of canister, composition of the buffer, shape of the borehole), and the natural barriers (e.g.\u00a0suitability of different host rock types, such as evaporites, crystalline rocks, argillaceous rocks, etc.), to determine their long-term behaviour and optimal configurations for safe repository design.\nThe Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) has been undertaking site characterisation at Forsmark, where the Swedish deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel is planned to be emplaced. The site is described extensively in SKB Technical Report SKB TR-08-05,\n31\n which presents the integrated understanding of the bedrock geology, hydrogeology, rock mechanical and thermal properties, in situ stresses, and existing fracture domains and deformation zones.\nThe construction of a deep nuclear waste repository will involve excavating and drilling a range of underground structures of different geometries and sizes, such as access tunnels, deposition tunnels and deposition boreholes.\n32\n One of the key issues that remains under investigation at Forsmark is the stability of the underground openings, and more specifically, the impact of stress-induced fractures on the deposition tunnels and boreholes, as well as their effect on the properties of the immediately-surrounding host rock. Understanding how over-stressed rock will behave following the creation of these voids will ensure an effective repository design and its long-term stability and maintenance.\nSeveral telescopic boreholes drilled as part of the Forsmark site investigation work\n33\n\n,\n\n34\n presented typical breakout patterns (Fig.\u00a01), with widths and depths in the range of 40\u2013180\n\u00b0\n and 0.2\u201367.5\u00a0mm respectively. These boreholes were percussion drilled with a diameter of cca. 200\u2013250\u00a0mm in the first 100\u00a0m, and core drilled with a diameter of cca. 77\u00a0mm in the following 1000\u00a0m. Their dimensions and excavation methods are different from those of the future deposition boreholes,\n35\n which will accommodate the spent fuel, but the occurrence of spalling patterns in the investigation boreholes indicates possible stress-induced fracture growth impact on the deposition boreholes as well.\nThe main goals of this study are: (1) determine the effectiveness of the geometric fracture growth method in reproducing fracture mechanisms associated with mechanical spalling, and (2) model fracture initiation and growth following the excavation stage of underground openings in brittle rock formations. The Forsmark candidate area is chosen to investigate the impact of in situ stresses, deposition tunnel orientation, borehole geometry and spacing on the predicted breakout patterns. Since no deposition boreholes have yet been drilled at Forsmark, this paper also presents the first numerical predictions of fracture growth leading to spalling at the planned repository site.\n\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nThe present work models stress-induced spalling fractures geometrically, in an isotropic, homogeneous, and linear elastic brittle rock domain. Fractures are represented discretely using smooth parametric surfaces and their growth is evaluated at each fracture tip, where three modal stress intensity factors (SIFs) are calculated, capturing both tension and shear. SIFs represent the energy necessary to deform the fracture, and they determine the extent and orientation of growth vectors at every fracture tip.\nThe volumetric discretisation of the domain conforms to the evolving fracture geometry and is updated at each growth step to follow the new internal geometry. Fracture extension is thus not constrained by the mesh. Multiple fractures of different sizes and evolving shapes grow in response to the local stress state at their tips, with growth being influenced by the stress distribution within the domain, accounting for in situ stresses, fracture interaction, and variations in material properties due to ensuing damage.\nThis method has been applied in three dimensions in other studies, including fracture interaction,\n36\n hydraulic fracturing,\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n and THM fracture growth in the context of geothermal energy.\n39\n In particular, the present work presents extensions to the method that describe the nucleation of new fractures and the pervasive use of lofting to update geometric descriptions of fractures during growth. During the simulation, fracture geometry is always stored independently from the mesh,\n40\n and a new optimised mesh is created at every iteration at minimal computational cost using a fully parallel octree-based volumetric algorithm. The finite element method is used to compute the deformation in the system, taking into account the physical properties of both the rock domain and the fracture surfaces.\n\n2.1\nDisplacement, stress and strain\nInitial deformation of the intact rock domain is computed in response to the applied boundary stresses, as linear elastic deformation.\n41\n For a homogeneous and isotropic rock matrix, the linear elastic stress\u2013strain equation is \n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c3\n=\nD\n\n(\n\u025b\n\u2212\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\u03c3\n and \n\u025b\n are the stress and strain tensors, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n0\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n0\n\n\n represent the initial stress and strain, and D is the linear elastic stiffness matrix, which accounts for the rock mechanical properties. Infinitesimal strain theory is then used to compute the strain corresponding to a given displacement gradient.\n42\n In three dimensions, this can be written as \n\n(2)\n\n\n\u025b\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2207u\n+\n\n\n\n(\n\u2207u\n)\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, Eqs.\u00a0(1) and (2) are incorporated into an equilibrium equation that relates the forces and moment applied to the numerical domain, to the stresses that develop inside the domain: \n\n(3)\n\n\n\u2202\u03c3\n+\nF\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nFriction\nFractures are represented by a set of curve edges, which contains all the fracture tips, and two three-dimensional surfaces joined by the fracture edges. Fractures can either be open, with a varying aperture distribution, partially closed, or fully closed. The contact between the two fracture surfaces is resolved using a gap-based Augmented Lagrangian method with Uzawa algorithm adapted to fracture contact, that captures both stick and slip regimes across the fracture surface.\n43\n\n\nIn the simulations presented in this paper, modelling of contact between fractures walls assumes friction \n\n\u03bc\n=\n0\n.\n45\n\n, and utilises three internal, and three external Uzawa iterations, a total of nine iterations per cycle to resolve the effect of the friction and contact on the stress state. The friction coefficient was estimated by SKB from tilt tests at Forsmark,\n32\n designed for fracture parameter determination according to Barton and Bandis.\n44\n\n\n\n\n2.3\nDamage and fracture nucleation\nFracture nucleation is implemented based on a continuum damage model.\n45\n Damage mechanics is suitable to model spalling initiation, since this process occurs at micro-scale, where the rock is loaded beyond its elastic limit. After creating a borehole in a previously intact rock, the resulting stress concentration around the borehole creates a region of local degradation of the material, where fractures nucleate. This will generate a more realistic model of stress-induced brittle fracturing and a better representation of failure kinematics.\n24\n\n\nFractures nucleate in the regions or elements with the largest damage, i.e. where the rock stiffness has been most degraded due to the stress redistribution around the borehole. The damage model of Mazars\n45\n is used, as this has been shown to predict quasi-brittle behaviour accurately. This is different from the linear-elastic equations above, as a damage parameter d is introduced to scale the stiffness matrix.\nEq.\u00a0(1) now becomes: \n\n(4)\n\n\n\u03c3\n=\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nd\n)\n\nD\n\u025b\n\n\n\n\n\nThe damage parameter is found by calculating the equivalent strain, \n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u0303\n\n\n, which is the L2 norm of the positive part of the strain tensor: \n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u0303\n\n\n=\n\u2016\n\u3008\u025b\u3009\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the equivalent strain \n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u0303\n\n\n is compared with a critical strain threshold, \n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u0303\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n, which is the ratio of the rock tensile strength and the undamaged Young\u2019s Modulus, to decide if and where the fractures can nucleate: \n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u0303\n\n\n\u2265\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\u0303\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1\nInitial disk size\nThe initial flaw sizes are normally distributed and scaled with the amount of damage present at the nucleation location. Fig.\u00a02 shows an example of nucleating 100 initial fracture disks around a circular borehole, where (A) all of them have uniform initial radii of 50\u00a0cm, (B) the initial sizes follow a normal distribution, with 50\u00a0cm mean radius and 20% of the mean radius as standard deviation and (C) the initial sizes are normally distributed as in the previous case, but also scaled according to the damage distribution.\nThe largest disk size, corresponding to the highest damage present in the rock, is set to 50\u00a0cm and decreases as shown in Fig.\u00a02C, taking as a maximum value the size of the element in which damage is computed. Before nucleation, the area surrounding the borehole walls was refined to enforce a minimum element length of 0.5\u00a0m, which reduces as fractures are created and their tips are refined. During nucleation, fractures of radius consistent with the size of their corresponding nucleating elements are created. This translates to initial fractures of 0.5\u00a0m maximum radius, reducing element size to \n\n2\n\u00d7\n\u03c0\n\u00d7\n0\n.\n5\n\/\n12\n=\n0\n.\n26\n\n m, for 12 tips per fracture, and subsequently reducing as fractures get inserted with a minimum radius of 0.01\u00a0m.\nThus, for a damaged element in which a fracture is being nucleated, the maximum diameter of the fracture will be given by the maximum length of the element in the plane defined by the fracture normal. This can be adjusted to be made to always be contained by the element, and can be adjusted to be a pure material property. A fixed fracture length, consistent with changing element sizes, is implemented throughout the presented simulations, as it better captures spalling fractures that nucleate closest to the borehole wall, while also capturing smaller fractures that nucleate away from the borehole in zones of lower damage, that may not be directly involved in spalling or splitting of the borehole wall (Fig.\u00a02C).\n\n\n2.3.2\nNumber of initial disks\nThe number of initial seeds is the maximum number of fractures that can nucleate during a simulation. When the damage criterion is not satisfied, additional fractures will not nucleate, regardless of whether the maximum number of fractures has been reached or not. Fig.\u00a02 shows an example of nucleating 100 initial fracture disks, with the different sizing strategies explained above. The present approach does not aim to numerically model growth of every individual fracture that occurs at the borehole wall. Instead, flaws are geometrically modelled in locations where the damage is the highest.\n\nThe initial fracture disks are prevented from nucleating on the surface of the borehole wall, but there is no artificial restriction on growth, as the fractures are allowed to evolve following fracture mechanics principles (see Section\u00a02.4). The nucleation process is in line with the earliest two stages of spalling observed by Haimson\n12\n on cm-scale Westerly granite cores, who described spalling initiation as a three-stage process: (a) growth of tensile micro-cracks (Mode I), subparallel to \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n1\n\n\n, and along \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n3\n\n\n; (b) interaction and coalescence of these micro-cracks into clusters, delineating rock slabs, and (c) intersection with the free borehole surface and buckling of the slabs.\nThe nucleation method used in this paper captures the sequential nature of the breakout development partially. There are no micro-fractures forming at the borehole wall that coalesce and buckle in a progressive manner. Instead, a damage model is used to determine the loci of fracture initiation. The final shapes and depths of failure are suitably reproduced (Section\u00a04), after growth and interaction of the macro-fractures is completed. Since fracture growth is determined by the energy at the fracture tip, each nucleated fracture disk will extend to accommodate the damage around it until it either intersects a free surface, or ends up in the stress shadow zone of another fracture, which had already accounted for the damage present in its respective neighbourhood.\nIntersections between fractures and the free borehole surface are handled using 3D Boolean operations. When a fracture reaches the borehole wall, the fracture is split by the borehole wall and the parts that reside inside the borehole are discarded. Further growth into the borehole is handled by defining a high \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nC\n\n\n for the borehole material, which prohibits tip growth inside the borehole.\n\n\n2.3.3\nDamage of the rock domain\nThe Young\u2019s Modulus in the model is modified based on the concept of strain equivalence of Lemaitre,\n46\n who proposed that the damage state may be described through an elastic modulus change of the material: \n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n\u0303\n\n\n=\nE\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nd\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nd\n is the damage variable from\u00a0Eq.\u00a0(4), and \n\n\nE\n\n\n\u0303\n\n\n is the damaged Young\u2019s Modulus. In the numerical simulations, Young\u2019s Modulus is stored as a constraint point variable, with one value computed per integration point of the element. This captures variation of the properties within the volumetric element, and ensures a continuous loss of rock strength across the element. Therefore, the variation of the material properties occurs at a finer level than the actual dimension of the mesh. For visualisation purposes, throughout this paper, Young\u2019s Modulus is extrapolated to the element to simplify its graphical representation.\nTo ensure the numerical stability of the simulations, the minimum value of Young\u2019s modulus is capped at a small non-zero value (for most simulations herein, 10 Pa), which effectively corresponds to a substantial reduction of the elasticity modulus, meaning that the rock has completely lost its integrity. The damage variable \nd\n is calculated using the Mazars\n45\n damage model. For a general stress state, the damage parameter is defined as a linear combination of damage under tension and under compression: \n\n(8)\n\n\nd\n=\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nt\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nt\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nc\n\n\n account for tensile and compressive stress states, respectively.

Although the main repository host rock at Forsmark is a granodiorite, the pegmatite approximation should be sufficient. This can be confirmed in future analysis when relevant data from experimental tests on granodiorite becomes available. Souissi et al.\n49\n showed that three different rocks (a granite, a limestone, and a sandstone) may have identical Mazars damage parameters, since the brittle stress\u2013strain response of the three rocks in the post-failure stage is similar.\n\n\n\n2.4\nFracture growth\nBased on the knowledge of the stress and displacement fields, fractures are set to nucleate when the damage exceeds the critical strain threshold. In order for these to grow, in addition to the stresses and displacements, stress intensity factors (SIFs)\n50\n are calculated at the fracture tips for the three principal deformation modes (\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n, \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\n\n\n, and \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n).\nNumerically, SIFs are calculated using the J-integral, evaluated at each fracture tip using the virtual integration disk method.\n51\n\n,\n\n52\n This method computes the \nI\n-integral numerically over a two-dimensional virtual disk domain, providing the strain energy release rate, \nG\n, from which the values of \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n, \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\n\n\n, and \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n are extracted.\n53\n Alternatively, if the fractures are too close to one another, SIFs can be calculated from the displacement field, using the displacement correlation and the quarter point technique\n54\n\n,\n\n55\n to increase displacement accuracy around the fractures tips.\nComputed SIFs are incorporated into a 3D mixed-mode criterion\n56\n that evaluates the projected stress intensity factor (\n\n\nK\n\n\nv\n\n\n) onto the local coordinate system of the fracture. This criterion enables fracture growth when \n\n\nK\n\n\nv\n\n\n exceeds the material toughness: \n\n(12)\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nv\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n4\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n4\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2265\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nC\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nC\n\n\n is the critical stress intensity factor for Mode I fractures, or material toughness, and \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n1\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n2\n\n\n represent the material toughness ratios of mode I to mode II (\n\n1\n\/\n1\n.\n3268\n\n) and mode I to mode III respectively (\n\n1\n\/\n0\n.\n6297\n\n). These values have been determined by Chang et al.\n57\n and Aliha et al.\n58\n for different materials. Fracture tips that have met the failure criterion will extend by a certain length, and in a certain direction. Extension length is calculated using a formulation of the Paris-type extension criterion proposed by Thomas et al.\n59\n: \n\n(13)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nG\n\n\nf\n\n\n is the fracture energy release rate, corresponding to the largest value of \n\n\nG\n\n\nn\n\n\n on fracture \nf\n; \n\n\nG\n\n\nn\n\n\n is fracture tip energy release rate, calculated at each fracture tip node; \n\n\nG\n\n\nv\n\n\n is the largest value of \n\n\nG\n\n\nf\n\n\n in the fracture domain; \n\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n is maximum extension length per growth step from all fractures in the domain and \n\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n is maximum individual fracture extension. The second extension length is calculated once per fracture tip \nn\n: \n\n(14)\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n is the extension of a local tip and \n\n\nG\n\n\nn\n\n\n is the energy release rate at tip \nn\n. \n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nf\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nn\n\n\n correspond to fracture and tip growth rate exponents respectively. Since different \n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nf\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nn\n\n\n values influence how individual tips and interacting fractures grow with respect to each other, several cases were tested to determine which values of the growth exponents generate representative spalled zones geometries in both radial and axial directions. Throughout this paper \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n25\n\n, \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n75\n\n and \n\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n 0.4\u00a0m.\nAt each fracture tip location, an angle criterion\n56\n is applied to determine the direction in which the crack will extend. This criterion employs the three SIFs as follows: \n\n(15)\n\n\n\u03d5\n=\n\u00b1\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n+\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\n\n\n+\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n\n\n+\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\n\n\n+\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\n\n\n+\n\n\nK\n\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nA\n=\n140\n\u00b0\n\n and \n\nB\n=\n\u2212\n70\n\u00b0\n\n. The angle criterion has been validated by Richard et al.,\n60\n who compared the numerical predictions with experimental data for a number of materials and boundary conditions, and concluded that they can be applied to predict fracture growth accurately.\nImplemented growth criteria allow the numerical model to capture deformation on each of the tips along the fracture front, so these can grow in different directions and magnitudes in response to the local stresses.\n\n\n2.5\nFracture geometry, NURBS, and lofting\nThe fracture geometry consists of an ensemble of points, curves and surfaces, and it evolves as a function of deformation. Fractures are represented through non-uniform B-splines (NURBS) curves and surfaces. NURBS have been increasingly used in representing fracture domains,\n61\n because they can accurately describe a wide range of shapes: from simple 2D lines and curves, to more complex 3D free-form surfaces and volumes. Piegl and Tiller\n62\n give a general overview of NURBS and Paluszny et al.\n63\n show the advantages of using NURBS in the context of fracture mechanics with explicit geometric representation of fracture shapes.\n\nFig.\u00a03A shows an example of fracture growth under uniaxial tension from an initial smooth disk, for a total of five growth steps. In this case, the fracture surface is constructed by connecting the old (prior to growth) and new (after growth) sets of fracture tips through triangles.\n\nDuring the first growth step, the initial smooth crack boundary becomes a set of polylines, connected at the fracture tips. This process causes a high density mesh (Fig.\u00a03C) to be generated around the fracture, to conform with the evolving fracture geometry. An improved construction of the geometry of the fracture surface is through lofting (Fig.\u00a03B), which results in a coarser mesh of high quality that provides a smooth representation of the geometry, while maintaining fidelity to the fracture geometry.\nThe lofting process is illustrated in Fig.\u00a04. At each growth step, a smooth NURBS curve, representing the fracture front, is constructed through the newly computed fracture tips. A NURBS curve of degree \np\n is a piece-wise polynomial curve, that can be represented in the parametric \n\nu\n\u2212\nv\n\n space as: \n\n(16)\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nk\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n0\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\ni\n,\np\n\n\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n\nP\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\nP\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\nw\n\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\n,\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\n,\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\n\n\nz\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\n,\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n,\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n are the weighted control points of the curve and \n\n\n\nN\n\n\ni\n,\np\n\n\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n are the basis functions of the curve.

The successive NURBS curves representing the fracture front at every growth step represent the section curves of the fracture surface. The lofting technique consists of mathematically blending the section curves together to form a smooth surface.\n64\n Similar to the definition of a NURBS curve, a NURBS surface of degree \n\np\n\u00d7\nq\n\n in the \n\nu\n\u2212\nv\n\n parametric space is commonly defined as: \n\n(17)\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n(\nu\n,\nv\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n=\n0\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n0\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\ni\n,\np\n\n\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n\nN\n\n\ni\n,\nq\n\n\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\nP\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\nP\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\nw\n\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n,\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n,\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\nz\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n,\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n)\n\n\n are the control points of the surface, and \n\n\n\nN\n\n\ni\n,\np\n\n\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n and \n\n\n\nN\n\n\ni\n,\nq\n\n\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n are the basis functions of the surface. The two sets of surface basis functions are defined over their corresponding knot vectors.\nThe geometric process of lofting consists of performing curve interpolations across the control points of the section curves, resulting in the control net of the surface. Control points do not necessarily always lie on the physical location of those of the curves, but rather describe their domain through a series of recursive operations that translate a local reference space into a curve or surface that exists in physical space.\nThe newly constructed surface is called a lofted surface, as it lofts or approximates the region between a pair of two curves, each described by a set of control points of equal size. These cross-sectional curves become isoparametric curves of the lofted surface as shown in Fig.\u00a04. The final surface shape will depend on the number, shape and positioning of the section curves, and will evolve as in the natural system by adding new surfaces to the existing surface object. Piegl and Tiller\n62\n provide an in-depth description of NURBS geometries and relevant operations.\n\nIn the context of modelling fracture growth in nuclear waste repositories, NURBS representations of fractures are advantageous for several reasons: they capture details at many scales, since they are not limited by a specific resolution; they do not require large storage memory, which would be problematic if hundreds of fractures are generated; they are consistent with emerging isogeometric methods. The gains from representing complex geometries using parametric surfaces, such as NURBS, are substantial, allowing for substantially higher quality meshes to be generated in an efficient manner for their use in both mechanics and flow numerical experiments.\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nExperimental setup\nThe borehole and tunnel geometries used in this paper are those currently planned for the final repository\n66\n that will be constructed at the Forsmark site. The in situ stresses and rock properties are also representative of those encountered at Forsmark,\n31\n\n,\n\n35\n with the exception of Mode\u00a0I fracture toughness, which corresponds to the \u00c4sp\u00f6 diorite.\n8\n There are currently no measurements of fracture toughness available at Forsmark, but SKB is conducting tests to estimate it. The influence of the new values will be analysed when the new data becomes available.\n\nSeveral cases are considered:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nBorehole model (Fig.\u00a05A): a 20\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 20\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 20\u00a0m block model, containing a 1.75\u00a0m diameter circular vertical borehole, subjected to a far-field anisotropic triaxial stress. Far-field stresses \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n are applied on the top, left and front domain surfaces respectively, and displacements are fixed, for numerical convergence, on the faces and edges symmetrically opposite to the faces and edges where the stresses are applied. Roller boundaries (circle symbols) show the direction in which outer nodes can move freely. The corner node where three constrained boundaries intersect one another is constrained in all three directions (triangle symbol). Inner nodes belonging to the borehole surface are not constrained. This scenario was altered for the validation case (Section\u00a04), where \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n were flipped, to simulate the spalling in the roof and the floor of a horizontal tunnel.\n\n\n\u2022\nBorehole and tunnel model (Fig.\u00a05B): Similar to the simple borehole model, but the borehole is attached to a \u201cfree\u201d boundary simulating the effect of the deposition tunnel. The \u201ctop\u201d domain boundary is split into three surfaces and no vertical forces (\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n=\n 0 MPa) are applied on the nodes belonging to the tunnel floor. The \u201cfree\u201d surface is illustrated as a 4.2\u00a0m wide red-coloured \u201cstripe\u201d, which corresponds to the width of the deposition tunnel floor. The rest of the \u201ctop\u201d boundary is subjected to vertical stress, as triaxial stress conditions return away from the tunnel floor. This was shown to model the effect of the deposition tunnel on the stress distribution, without requiring to model the tunnel explicitly in subsequent simulations, resulting in faster runtimes.\n67\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nMultiple borehole model (Fig.\u00a05C): The same as the borehole and tunnel model, with additional boreholes on either side of the central borehole, aligned along the tunnel axial direction. Several borehole spacings are tested, on a 3-borehole model, as well as the effect of increasing the number of boreholes in the model to five and seven.\n\n\n\u2022\nModified borehole model (Fig.\u00a05D): The 1.75\u00a0m diameter circular borehole is enlarged at the top, in a cone shape and a wedge shape, respectively. Modified borehole geometry would facilitate the emplacement of the spent nuclear fuel canister.\n32\n\n,\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nValidation\nIn this work, mechanical spalling is simulated in three dimensions using the Imperial College Geomechanics Toolkit (ICGT), a finite-element-based discrete fracture growth simulator written in C++. The ICGT has been extensively validated for fracture growth\n59\n\n,\n\n69\n and fracture interaction\n36\n\n,\n\n59\n in three-dimensions, as well as for friction and contact\n43\n and flow and permeability.\n70\n In this section, the present fracture growth methodology implemented in ICGT is validated against the URL Mine-By Experiment, for mechanical spalling.\n\n\nThe Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) carried out the Mine-by tunnel experiment\n6\n in order to characterise spalling around a circular borehole under high stresses. The experiment consisted of drilling a 3.5\u00a0m diameter circular tunnel in a relatively unfractured granitic rock. The tunnel was excavated subparallel to the intermediate principal stress direction \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n, in order to maximise the difference between the minimum and maximum compressive stresses acting on the tunnel boundary. Spalling became apparent in both the roof and the floor of the tunnel (diametrically opposite) after the borehole was cleaned and the spalled flakes removed through scaling (Fig.\u00a06A). The maximum depth of the spalled zone was approximately 50\u00a0cm, with variations along the tunnel length, and the rock mass remained intact beyond this point.\nThe numerical model pertaining to the validation case was set up using the rock properties of the Lac du Bonnet granite, and far-field stresses corresponding to the in situ conditions at the 420 Level: \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n=\n 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 MPa, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n=\n 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 MPa, and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n=\n 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 MPa.\n72\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a06B and C show the final fractured zone geometry, after the spalling process has stabilised and fracture growth has arrested, in radial and axial view respectively. Each macro-fracture that interacts with the borehole wall can be regarded as a \u201cfractured zone\u201d. When compared with other numerical studies, which model the progressive splitting of the borehole wall through coalescence of smaller fractures,\n3\n\n,\n\n5\n or through propagation of active damage planes,\n73\n the fractures shown in this paper represent the final stage of failure and they inherently encompass all the intermediate stages.\nSpalling extent is given by the fractured region around the borehole. For each fracture surface, the \u201cspalling depth\u201d is the maximum distance measured between fracture tip nodes and the borehole wall, and the \u201cspalling width\u201d is the maximum arc length of that fracture around the borehole, as seen from an observation point at the top of the borehole. The maximum measured depths and widths of the two fracture arrays forming the diametrically-opposite notches (Fig.\u00a06B) are consistent with those observed in the field (Fig.\u00a06A). Although a relatively small number of fracture disks are initiated, i.e.,\u00a010, they are allowed to grow freely, based on the energy in the system, eventually covering the entire length of the borehole and accommodating the whole range of damage that develops in the near-borehole region after the borehole drilling stage.\nRock buckling and collapse into the borehole are not explicitly modelled, but the loss of integrity of the borehole is accounted for through damage. This is illustrated in Fig.\u00a07, where the elastic modulus of the host rock is degraded (Eq.\u00a0(7)) in the vicinity of the borehole, amounting to a 60% reduction in the intact rock elastic modulus (Fig.\u00a07A). Once fractures nucleate, Young\u2019s Modulus is reduced completely in the elements neighbouring the newly spawned fracture surfaces (Fig.\u00a07B). Further degradation of the rock mass occurs as fractures grow (Fig.\u00a07C), covering the whole length of the tunnel. As opposed to the field experiment where the two diametrically opposite spalled zones were asymmetrical, the fractured zones in the numerical model tend to be symmetrical, due to the prescribed homogeneity and isotropy of the numerical domain.\nTo achieve the fracture patterns shown in Fig.\u00a06, several parameters were calibrated for nucleation and growth: number of initial disks \n=\n 10; initial disk size \n=\n 30\u00a0cm, following a normal distribution and scaled with damage, cf. Fig.\u00a02 C; minimum fracture spacing \n\n=\n1\n.\n5\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00a0initial disk size; maximum extension length \n\n\u0394\n\n\nl\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n 40\u00a0cm per growth step; \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n25\n\n; \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n75\n\n. These parameters are used throughout the paper, in the subsequent simulations of spalling at the Forsmark site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nEffect of the deposition tunnel\nThe deposition tunnel is expected to affect fracture nucleation and growth patterns, through changing the stress state at the top of the deposition boreholes, where it acts as a free surface. Saceanu et al.\n67\n showed that the same tunnel effect can be modelled in two ways: (a) by explicitly modelling the deposition tunnel as an individual body in a larger domain, or (b) using modified boundary conditions on the top surface of the domain and creating a \u201cfree\u201d boundary where the deposition borehole is attached. This change has a minimal effect on the simulated fracture geometries, but is computationally more efficient, since it employs a simplified domain, with a reduced number of nodes and elements. The resulting stress fields around the borehole were shown to be nearly identical in the two models where either the whole tunnel, or the tunnel floor, was simulated.\n67\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a08 shows the damage (Eq.\u00a0(8)) distribution in a full borehole and tunnel model, following the nucleation of the initial fracture disks. The tunnel is excavated in one step and the displacements, strains and stresses are computed in the model containing only the tunnel. Subsequently, the borehole is drilled in one step, and the stresses are re-computed in the full borehole and tunnel model. Fig.\u00a08 A\u2013C shows separate instances of preferred nucleation loci in the full model containing 10, 50 and 100 initial disks respectively. The highest damage concentrations occur at the intersection of the tunnel floor and its sidewalls and at the intersection of the deposition borehole wall and the wedge-shaped access ramp. These results are in line with experimental observations where fractures nucleate preferentially around sharp-edged boundaries.\n74\n\n\nNumerically, first fractures to nucleate are those at the edges of the tunnel floor (Fig.\u00a08A), followed by spalling of the borehole top\/access ramp (Fig.\u00a08B), and finally spalling of the lower curvature surfaces such as the tunnel roof and the rest of the borehole wall (Fig.\u00a08C). This is also an example of the complexity of a full borehole and tunnel model, which requires hundreds of fractures to capture the complete state of the damage present around both cavities. In this paper, only the fractures directly involved in the development of the borehole breakouts\/borehole spalling are further analysed. Consequently, the single-step borehole excavation is considered to be representative of the subsurface behaviour, given that observed fractures take significantly longer time (4\u20138 months\n7\n) to develop the v-shaped notches in the field, compared to 30\u2013105\u00a0h\n75\n required to complete a typical deposition borehole.\n\nFig.\u00a09 shows the minimum principal stress distribution in the 20\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 20\u00a0m \n\u00d7\n 20\u00a0m single-borehole model, with (A) and without (C) tunnel effect, after the borehole drilling stage. In the close vicinity of the tunnel floor, the triaxial compressive conditions become biaxial, due to the removal of the vertical stress. Borehole geometry and initial fractures disks that ensue after nucleation are superimposed, showing fractures nucleating preferentially parallel to the tunnel floor in the first 2\u00a0m below it, and changing their nucleation orientation further down the borehole. As \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n3\n\n\n increases further away from the tunnel floor and triaxial conditions return, fractures align themselves perpendicular to the minimum compressive stress direction, and hence parallel to the borehole wall.\n\n\nFig.\u00a09B and D show the final fracture geometries after growth has arrested, in the two cases. In the case where the tunnel floor is considered, the top fractures grow to a lesser extent in the borehole axial direction, and there is overall less interaction with the borehole wall and between the fractures themselves. Instead, fractures tend to propagate in the plane of the tunnel floor, appearing to increase spalling depth. However, since there is little growth along the borehole wall, the actual fractured surface area is smaller than in the case where the tunnel floor is not considered.\n\nFig.\u00a09B and D also shows fracture tip nodes at all growth steps, coloured according to their dominant failure mode. In both cases, most tips appear to fail under tension in the early stages of the breakout development, but further fracture propagation is mixed mode, and mainly determined by either Mode II or Mode III tip failure. As expected, in the case where the deposition tunnel is considered, more tips fail in tension, since decreasing confining stress promotes tensile fracture conditions.\n\n5.1\nEffect of tunnel orientation\nSeveral cases were investigated, in which the tunnel floor was orientated axially parallel to the direction of the maximum horizontal far-field stress, and then rotated in 15 degree increments, until it became perpendicular. Fig.\u00a010B illustrates simulated fracture patterns in three different cases, in which the deposition tunnel makes an angle of 0\n\u00b0\n, 30\n\u00b0\n and 45\n\u00b0\n respectively with \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n. The computed displacement and stress field around the borehole change in direction, at fixed stress magnitudes. Results show that tunnel orientation influences the loci where the fractures involved in borehole spalling nucleate, relative to the tunnel floor, but does not influence the depth of the final fractured areas significantly.\nThe spalling depth, spalling width, and total fracture surface area in each case are listed in Table\u00a02. These remain consistent at different tunnel orientations, because the tunnel floor edges are sufficiently far away from the borehole wall to prevent unstable fracture growth and interaction with tunnel floor\/sidewalls. Given the in situ conditions at Forsmark, spalling is not predicted to occur in the tunnel axial direction, unless the tunnel is drilled perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress (Fig.\u00a010A). Section\u00a08 shows further examples, deliberately probing this worst-case tunnel orientation scenario, to understand the behaviour for cases where fracture growth and interaction between neighbouring boreholes is modelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nEffect of in situ stress state\nThree in situ stress scenarios are investigated. In the base case, the three principal far-field stresses are assigned their mean expected values at 500\u00a0m depth at Forsmark (Table\u00a01). In the two other cases, the stress magnitudes are chosen such that, within their given uncertainty range, stress anisotropy is minimised and maximised, respectively. Previous studies have shown that fracture growth is promoted by higher stress differentials at the borehole wall.\n76\n\n,\n\n77\n Thus, the other two limiting stress scenarios correspond to (1) \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n=\nm\na\nx\n\n., \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n=\nm\na\nx\n\n. and (2) \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n=\nm\ni\nn\n\n., \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n=\nm\ni\nn\n\n.\n\nFig.\u00a011A shows the maximum principal stress at the borehole wall, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n1\n\n\n, corresponding to the base case and the two limiting\u00a0in situ stress conditions at Forsmark. Assuming there are no fluids in the borehole, the tangential stress varies in a sinusoidal fashion as a function of angular distance, matching the analytical solution for a circular hole in a rock mass with prescribed far-field principal stresses.\n42\n In all cases, the tangential stress exceeds (0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05) \n\u00d7\n UCS, or the \u201cspalling strength\u201d the rock mass.\n15\n\nFig.\u00a011 B and C show how several far-field stress scenarios within the limiting cases affect the borehole tangential stress magnitude. For constant far-field maximum stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n, variations of the far-field intermediate stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n cause borehole Hoop stress changes within \n\u00b1\n5% of its base case value at 90\n\u00b0\n and 270\n\u00b0\n, where spalling is expected to occur. Conversely, varying the far-field maximum stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n causes large \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n1\n\n\n changes at the borehole wall, covering the entire range between the two limiting stress scenarios. This shows that variations of the intermediate\u00a0in situ stress alone are less important in affecting the maximum borehole stress at Forsmark than variations of the maximum\u00a0in situ stress. Since all cases fall within the minimum (red line) and maximum (blue line) stress differential scenarios, subsequent fracturing behaviour was analysed in these limiting cases.\n\n\nFig.\u00a010A shows the simulated fracture patterns for the three different stress magnitude scenarios (Fig.\u00a011 A), at perpendicular orientation of the deposition tunnel relative to the direction of the maximum compressive stress. Fractures nucleate and grow diametrically opposite around the circular borehole in the direction of the least compressive horizontal stress, as observed in numerous occasions in the field.\n72\n\n,\n\n78\n\n,\n\n79\n Fracture growth is influenced by the relative magnitudes of the stresses applied, with more damage and growth occurring under conditions of higher horizontal stress differential. Fracture growth is quantified in terms of the maximum spalled zone depth, spalled zone angle (width), and total fracture surface area (Table\u00a02).\nThe maximum depths of the fractured zones are comparable with predictions from Martin et al.\u2019s\n80\n empirical equation, which relates the ratio of maximum spalling depth and borehole radius to the ratio of maximum tangential stress at the excavation wall and the uniaxial compressive strength of the rock. Given the\u00a0in situ stresses and borehole geometry at Forsmark, Martin et al.\u2019s\n80\n empirical relationship predicts spalling depths ranging from a few centimetres in the case of lowest stress differential, up to around 15\u00a0cm in the case of highest stress differential. The simulated numerical results in this paper are in better agreement with Martin\u2019s empirical relationship in the case where the deposition tunnel is not considered (Table\u00a02), and also in the case where the tunnel is considered, for those the fractured zones residing in the lower half of the borehole (Fig.\u00a09). However, fracture nucleation and growth at the top of the borehole is affected by the deposition tunnel, causing a larger apparent maximum spalling depth than the one predicted by Martin\n17\n for the Forsmark site specifically. Another reason for the additional fracture growth might be that Martin\n17\n looks exclusively at tensile fractures, whereas in this study, spalling fractures initiate in tension, but macro-failure is multi-modal, and generally dominated by shear in the later growth stages.\nSince the depths and widths of breakouts in vertical boreholes depend on the relative magnitudes of the major and minor horizontal\u00a0in situ stresses,\n1\n fracture patterns and final breakout metrics are shown in Fig.\u00a010 only for the base-case and limiting stress scenarios, assuming that any other stress state that falls between the limiting cases will also cause fracturing severity to fall in the expected range.\n\n\n7\nEffect of the borehole geometry\nThis section investigates the effect of borehole geometry on the predicted spalling around a typical deposition borehole. The cylindrical borehole is modified at the junction with the tunnel floor to provide an access ramp for the spent fuel canisters. This is a potentially practical modification that could provide additional space to operate the machines that will lower the spent fuel canisters into the borehole, effectively reducing the requirement of a \u2018tall\u2019 deposition tunnel.\n68\n Three cases were investigated, where the borehole top is cylindrical, conical, and wedge-shaped (Fig.\u00a05D).\n\nNumerical results show that spalling occurs in all cases, and the modified geometries affect fracture nucleation and growth patterns (Fig.\u00a012). Fractures nucleate uniformly on either side of the circular borehole (Fig.\u00a012A), but concentrate at the borehole top in the other two simulated cases (Fig.\u00a012B, C). The enlargement of the borehole top induces higher stress concentrations at the borehole\u2013tunnel junction, increasing the depth of failure in the top metre of the borehole. Fracture growth is quantified in terms of maximum spalling depths and total fractured surface areas, showing increasing severity from circular, to cone to wedge (Table\u00a02). Although the maximum absolute spalling depth is the largest in the wedge-shaped borehole case, this only occurs when the tunnel floor is orientated perpendicular to the maximum compressive stress direction. The fractured areas responsible for increased spalling depth on the ramp side are, as shown in Fig.\u00a012C, involved in the spalling of the ramp itself. However, if the tunnel is orientated parallel to the direction of the maximum compressive stress, the stress conditions required for ramp spalling would not be fulfilled and fractures would nucleate 90\n\u00b0\n away from the ramp, and grow as in the case of a simple circular borehole. For this reason, the symmetrical cone top is not recommended, as it would increase failure severity in all stress and\/or tunnel orientation scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nEffect of nearby boreholes\nIn all cases presented previously, fracturing processes were localised in the near-borehole region, and the maximum depth of the fractured zones, although variable from case to case, did not exceed one borehole radius. In this section, additional boreholes are added, as shown in Fig.\u00a05C, at an equal inter-borehole distance, on either side of the central circular borehole. The inter-borehole distance is then gradually decreased, to examine the changes in the displacement and stress fields, and their effects on fracture growth.\n\n8.1\nEffect of borehole spacing\nThe inter-borehole spacing is an important parameter affecting repository design, since it determines the minimum length of the deposition tunnel necessary to accommodate the required number of deposition boreholes. Ideally, this distance would be small enough that as many deposition boreholes as possible would fit along the same deposition tunnel, but large enough to preserve the structural integrity of the repository. The current site-descriptive model from Forsmark recommends a distance of either 6\u00a0m (in rock domain RFM029) or 6.8\u00a0m (in RFM045) between adjacent boreholes, in the case where thermal effects are also considered.\n31\n In this study, the inter-borehole distance, s, is measured between borehole centres, hence the effective pillar width is given by \n\ns\n\u2212\n2\nR\n\n, where \nR\n is the borehole radius.\n\nFig.\u00a013 shows the normalised maximum principal stress at the borehole wall that arises when two boreholes are subjected to transverse, longitudinal and biaxial tension respectively. For validation purposes, the maximum circumferential stress was plotted against the closed-form solutions derived for these cases by Ling,\n81\n showing a good match.\n\n\nFig.\u00a014 shows the elastic modulus distribution in the meshed rock domain, alongside corresponding fracture patterns in a three-borehole model. The boreholes are evenly spaced, at \n\ns\n=\n2\n.\n5\n\n (A), 3.0 (B), 3.5 (C) and 4.0 (D) metres apart, resulting in the formation of two over-stressed pillars of equal widths, \n\n\n\nP\n\n\nw\n\n\n=\n0\n.\n75\n\n (A), 1.25 (B), 1.75 (C) and 2.25 (D), respectively. For a borehole spacing of 2.5\u00a0m, the two pillars are completely damaged, as shown by the reduction in Young\u2019s Modulus. As the inter-borehole distance increases, the damage and corresponding reduction in Young\u2019s modulus decreases and becomes more localised to the walls of the boreholes. In the case of a 4.0\u00a0m spacing (Fig.\u00a014D), the centre of each pillar shows a 15% reduction of the original, undamaged Young\u2019s modulus, and areas of high damage are localised in the vicinity of the borehole wall, where the fractured regions reside. In this case, the three boreholes are not interconnected by a fractured zone and the region between them is largely undamaged.\nIn all cases, Young\u2019s Modulus remains unchanged from about one metre away from the peripheral boreholes, implying that beyond this point the host rock is undisturbed. Table\u00a02 presents the quantified interaction of the three boreholes spaced at 3, 4, 5, and 6\u00a0m, noting the maximum observed failure depth, width, and the total fractured surface area in each case.\n\n\n8.2\nEffect of total number of boreholes\n\nFig.\u00a015 shows maximum, intermediate and minimum principal stress distributions around a three- (A) and a five-borehole (B) array, spaced 4\u00a0m and 6\u00a0m apart, respectively. The three\/five aligned boreholes are created simultaneously, and their locations are varied in order to investigate the effect of borehole spacing, as well as the impact of total number of boreholes within an array, on borehole and pillar stress. The applied horizontal stresses are in all cases are \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n=\n 41 MPa and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n=\n 23.2 MPa, the vertical stress is \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n=\n 13.2 MPa. Fig.\u00a015C shows the maximum principal stress magnitude variation along the two pillars, in four different pillar widths scenarios. Comparison of the resulting stress magnitudes in the two pillars shows a 31% pillar stress increase when the inter-borehole distance decreases from 4.0\u00a0m to 2.5\u00a0m. While borehole spacing is shown to influence stress concentrations in the pillars (C), the number of boreholes in the model (D) does not influence stress distribution.\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a015D shows the maximum principal stress magnitude lateral variation in a three-, five- and seven-borehole model, respectively. In all three simulation models, the borehole spacing is six metres, and the domain was adjusted such as the distance between the outermost boreholes and the domain boundaries remains constant, in order to avoid boundary effects. The purpose of this exercise was to investigate whether increasing the number of neighbouring boreholes has an effect on stress state and fracture patterns around the innermost central borehole(s). It is apparent that regardless of the number of simulated boreholes, provided that the inter-borehole distance remains unchanged and sufficiently large, and the numerical domain is adjusted accordingly, there is no major change in the stress state around the central and outer boreholes.\nThis determines all boreholes to be equally damaged and hence fracture growth amounts to similar fractured area per borehole as well (Table\u00a02). This result agrees qualitatively with those obtained by Horii and Nemat-Nasser\n82\n and Wang et al.\n83\n for larger numbers of collinear circular openings under uniaxial tension. Their numerical studies also showed that interaction between central and non-central boreholes can be neglected as long as the borehole spacing is large enough to prevent interactions.\nThis is a useful result, supporting the validity of three-borehole simulation cases extrapolated to the repository scale. The alternative of simulating cm-scale, concurrent fracturing processes around dozens of deposition boreholes per deposition tunnel would not be computationally efficient yet. For example, in the single borehole case, there are initially 31,911 nodes, which, after the nucleation of ten fractures, increase to 75,704 nodes. For three boreholes, the number of nodes increases from 69,068 in the intact rock domain to 173,942 after the nucleation of thirty fractures, and finally, for five boreholes it increases from 106,920 to 282,170 after the nucleation of fifty fractures. The number of nodes keeps increasing as the fractures continue to grow, adding detailed discretisation to regions of the mesh that were previously coarser.\n\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nGeometric fracture growth simulations, based on the finite element method, are used to investigate stress-induced fracturing processes leading to spalling around deposition boreholes under different underground conditions. Several scenarios are considered, in which the in situ stresses, borehole geometries and spacing are varied to assess the impact on final fracture patterns and damage extent.\nIn the case of a single circular borehole excavated in a homogeneous and isotropic rock domain, results indicate that spalling failure initiates in areas of high damage close to the borehole wall and continues to develop in the direction of the least compressive stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n3\n\n\n, in agreement with experimental observations from laboratory and field studies.\nWhen the deposition tunnel floor was incorporated as a free surface, fractures at the intersection between the borehole and the tunnel nucleated preferentially parallel to the tunnel floor, and perpendicular to the borehole wall. This results in larger apparent spalled zones widths, but lower fractured surface area. Fractures in that case grow more horizontally, in the direction of the tunnel floor, instead of vertically, along the borehole itself. They also show less interaction with the borehole wall in the borehole axial direction. The tunnel is then rotated at different angles to the maximum horizontal stress, in order to assess the impact of stress orientation on fracture growth. Since the relative stress magnitudes were kept constant regardless of the tunnel orientation, the extent of the fractured zone remained consistent in all orientation cases, for a circular borehole.\nAnother scenario that was examined was the influence of varying in situ stress magnitudes. Results showed that damage exceeds the threshold required for nucleation in the near-borehole region, for the expected subsurface conditions at Forsmark. In the case of higher far-field stress differential, the fractures involved in spalling extended deeper into the host rock domain, while lower stress anisotropy caused the fracturing process to stabilise more locally.\nFinally, the effect of neighbouring boreholes and inter-borehole distance was investigated. Numerical results determined that the maximum stress concentration around flanked boreholes does not change significantly, regardless of the total number of boreholes in the model, provided that the domain boundaries and number of initial disks are adjusted accordingly, and the inter-borehole distance remains constant. The three-, five- and seven-borehole models were fundamentally identical in terms of fracturing behaviour around flanked (inner) borehole(s), and flanking (outer) boreholes. On the other hand, inter-borehole spacing plays an important role in pillar stability. Under the given conditions at Forsmark, circular boreholes need to be spaced at least 4\u00a0m apart to maintain pillar integrity under mechanical loading. In the case where access ramps are drilled, the spacing should be increased to at least 6\u00a0m, so that stability of the top of the borehole is ensured.\nThe present approach to model spalling failure and general fracturing around boreholes provides useful and quick information for designing a safe repository for nuclear waste storage. The modelled fracture patterns are consistent with previous studies and field observations, and the computational cost to generate them is low. The extent of the fractured areas around boreholes depends on a number of repository design parameters, some of which can be adjusted to minimise spalling severity and eventually reduce the risk for leaking radionuclides in this highly fractured zone.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nM.

Red bed soft rocks, which are widely distributed in Southern China, could affect many infrastructure projects, such as high-rise buildings and subways.\n11\n\n,\n\n12\n The physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the soft rocks change significantly when they contact water.\n12\u201315\n Therefore, the synthesis of red mudstone\u2013like materials becomes necessary for studying the physical and mechanical properties of red mudstone soft rocks.\nMany previous studies on synthetic rock (soil) materials used cement as a cement agent. For example, sand, kaolinite and silica fume with cement were synthesised to study the mechanical properties of sandstone or mudstone.\n6\n\n,\n\n16\n Consoli et al. synthesised cemented silty soil by mixing cement, water and soil for unconfined compressive testing with the aim of pavement base construction, channel lining and earth dam slope protection.\n8\n Fedrizzi et al. studied the petrophysical properties of carbonate rocks by using cement to bond calcite and quartz instead of expensive natural cores.\n4\n Arora et al. synthesised mudstone by mixing clay, cement and water, and compared the physical and mechanical properties with natural rock samples to address the challenges of obtaining natural, uniform and undisturbed samples.\n5\n Mondol et al. synthesised mudstone-like materials by mixing water, kaolinite and montmorillonite and by using mechanical compression (different vertical stress) to study their physical properties.\n7\n Nooraiepour et al. synthesised mudstone from water, quartz, kaolinite and montmorillonite by mechanical compression (different vertical stress) to study the permeability and physical properties of rocks.\n9\n\n\nAccording to previous research results, the study of rock-like materials generally only involves mechanical properties or physical properties; in the study of mechanical properties, cement is often used as a cement agent. Due to the brittleness of cement, the previous synthesis methods are mostly suitable for high-strength brittle, hard rock. For ductile and low-strength soft rock, such as red mudstone, it is difficult to obtain reasonable peak strength and post peak curve. In addition, cement changes the mineral composition of rock-like materials (which react to form tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, tetracalcium aluminate and calcium hydroxide), making rock-like materials very different from natural rocks. Some studies used sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) as a cement agent to solve this problem (water and silica are produced after sodium silicate decomposition).\n17\n\n,\n\n18\n\n\nThe diagenetic process of sedimentary rocks is generally the result of the joint action of cementation and compaction.\n19\n\n,\n\n20\n In previous research, similarity simulation experiments were mostly conducted from one aspect of diagenesis, and the synthesis of rock-like materials in relation to more than one factor has not been studied. For this reason, rock-like materials are similar to natural rocks in only one aspect: physical or mechanical properties.\nThe main purpose of this study is to provide a method to accurately synthesise and replace natural red mudstone in a certain range. In this study, red mudstone\u2013like materials were synthesised by the similarity simulation experiment method (1) to study the physical and mechanical properties of the rocks through diagenesis of sedimentary rocks. First, red mudstone\u2013like materials were synthesised according to the effects of sodium silicate content (c\n\nss\n), compression time (t) and vertical stress (\u03c3\n\nv\n). Second, the dry density (\u03c1), wave velocity (v), uniaxial compressive strength (peak stress, \u03c3\n\nc\n), deviatoric stress (\u03c3\n1\u2013\u03c3\n3), peak strain (\u03b5\n\nc\n), elastic modulus (E), internal friction angle (\u03c6) and cohesion (c) of red mudstone samples were obtained by conducting physical and mechanical (uniaxial and triaxial compression tests) tests. Third, the synthesis method was validated by comparing the properties of red mudstone\u2013like materials and natural red mudstone, and the relationship between the physical and mechanical properties of red mudstone\u2013like materials and synthesis parameters was established.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nMaterials\nIn this study, red mudstone-like materials were synthesised by the method of completely similar mineral composition and proportion to natural rock samples. The mineral composition of mudstone mainly includes clay minerals, quartz, feldspar and fine mica. There are also some small components such as calcite. The chemical composition of mudstone is mainly SiO2 and Al2O3 and some other oxides such as K2O, MgO, and Na2O. Red mudstone also contains some hematite (Fe2O3), which is the main reason for its red color. The classification of most identified fine-grained rocks is based on the relative abundance of silt and clay grains in these rocks. The relative abundance of silt and clay grains in mudstone ranges from 25% to 50% and from 50% to 75%, respectively.\n21\n The total mass of components needed to synthesise a mudstone sample is 500\u00a0g, as shown in Table 1\n. Quartz particle size is less than 0.075\u00a0mm.\nSodium silicate was selected as the cement agent to bind various mineral components in the sample preparation. It is a kind of inorganic material, different from Portland cement, it has a certain ductility, and also has a certain solubility after meeting water, which is suitable for the synthesis of soft rock such as red mudstone.\n18\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nSynthesis of red mudstone\u2013like materials\nMineral components were weighed out as per the quantities in Table 1 and mixed thoroughly. To prepare the cement agent, mixtures comprising various percentages of sodium silicate in water were prepared (Table 2\n). The samples and cement agent were then mixed thoroughly and placed into a cylindrical mold for mechanical compression (Fig. 1\na). The mold is composed of two semi cylinders, two circular sleeves and a base (Fig. 1b). After the mold is assembled (Fig. 1c), the mixture of mineral and cement agent can be loaded.\nThe mechanical compression times t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n applied to the samples are shown in Table 2. Samples were then ground flat at both ends and processed into cylindrical samples, each with a diameter of 50\u00a0mm and a height of 100\u00a0mm (Fig. 1d). The samples were put into a drying box and dried to a constant weight for subsequent tests.\n\n\n2.3\nPhysical and mechanical tests\nThe physical tests included dry density \u03c1 and wave velocity v (P-wave). Wave velocity v was detected by the C61 Non-Metallic Ultrasonic Detector in the Guangdong Key Infrastructure Safety Engineering Technology Research Center. C61 Non-Metallic Ultrasonic Detector can generate 5\u00a0Hz-500 kHz sound wave, and then use the sound wave transmission method to detect the properties of non-metallic materials such as rocks, and can record the dynamic waveform and wave velocity v in real time. Both ends of each sample were coated evenly with petroleum jelly, then two transducers were used to get close to both ends of the sample and collect the compressional wave velocity v. The microstructure of each sample was elucidated by the Zeiss EVO Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in the Instrumental Analysis and Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University. Zeiss Evo Scanning Electron Microscope is an analytical microscope with the ability to process various materials. It can be used for the analysis and identification of particle morphology and chemical composition.\nMechanical tests were conducted using a high spatiotemporal resolution 3D visualisation test system for multifield coupling damage of rock in the Guangdong Key Infrastructure Safety Engineering Technology Research Center. The experimental system can be loaded with a maximum axial force of 1000\u00a0kN and a conventional confining pressure of 20\u00a0MPa. In the uniaxial compression tests, the sample is first placed on the equipment, and then the axial stress is applied in the strain control mode until the sample is destroyed. In the triaxial compression tests, firstly, the sample needs to be wrapped with rubber film and the sample is placed on the equipment, then the confining pressure is increased to the target value by using the stress control mode, and finally the axial stress is applied by using the strain control mode until the sample is damaged. The axial loading speed for the uniaxial test and triaxial test was 0.2\u00a0mm\/min, and the confining pressure loading speed for the triaxial test was 0.1\u00a0MPa\/min. The confining pressures for the triaxial compression test were 0, 1, 2 and 3\u00a0MPa, respectively. Each group of samples in uniaxial compression test should be tested for 3 times, and each group of samples in triaxial compression test should be tested for 4 times according to different confining pressure.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nPhysical test results\n\n3.1.1\nDry density and wave velocity\nStudies on the physical properties of red mudstone\u2013like materials mainly involve density \u03c1 and wave velocity v (P-wave). The effects of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, compression time t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n on the density \u03c1 and wave velocity v of red mudstone\u2013like materials during sample preparation are shown in Fig. 2\n (In the figure, R2 is the correction decisive coefficient. The larger the value, the better the fitting degree.). In general, the density \u03c1 of red mudstone\u2013like materials was 1.88\u20132.02\u00a0g\/cm3 and the wave velocity v was 1227\u20131945 m\/s. Sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, compression time t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n showed a good linear relationship with density \u03c1 and wave velocity v. Sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n had a great influence on density \u03c1 and wave velocity v, while compression time t had almost no influence on wave velocity v. The greater the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, the greater the samples density \u03c1 and wave velocity v; the greater the vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n, the greater the sample density \u03c1 and wave velocity v. This indicates that increasing the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n is conducive to increasing the compactness of samples.\n\n\n3.1.2\nMicrostructure\nThe microstructure of the cracks in samples after uniaxial compression testing is shown in Fig. 3\n. As seen in Fig. 3a\u2013e, the higher the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, the larger the particles at the microscopic level and the smaller the pores between the particles, and the greater the likelihood of a compact structure. When the compression time t is short (3\u00a0h; Fig. 3f) the particles are small and the interparticle pores are large. When the compression time t is increased (6\u00a0h; Fig. 3c), the particles increase and form a whole, with a good cementation effect. When the compression time t increases even more (9\u00a0h; Fig. 3g), the particles embed into each other under the action of the external force and form new pores. When the pressure is smaller (40\u00a0MPa; Fig. 3h), the particles are loose and the micropores are larger. When the pressure increases (80\u00a0MPa; Fig. 3c), the particles are embedded together under the action of pressure to form larger particles. When the pressure increases even more (120\u00a0MPa; Fig. 3i), the particles become more fragmented.\nIn order to quantify the cementation of samples under the influence of different variables, the microstructures of SEM samples at magnifications of 500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0, 1000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0, 2000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0and 5000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0were elucidated by greyscale and binarisation. As can be seen from the results in Table 3\n, the higher the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, the smaller the pore ratio of each scale of the sample. When the compression time t is shorter and longer, the pores of the sample are larger, while when the compression time t is appropriate (6\u00a0h), the pores are smaller. The greater the pressure, the smaller the pore ratio. In addition, the larger the magnification of the sample, the larger the observed pore ratio.\n\n\n\n3.2\nUniaxial compression test results\n\n3.2.1\nStress\u2013strain curves\nThe uniaxial compression stress\u2013strain curves of red mudstone\u2013like materials are shown in Fig. 4\n. The stress\u2013strain curves for all tests can be roughly divided into the compaction stage, linear deformation stage, non-linear deformation stage, yield stage, and post-peak failure and strain-softening stage. These five stages correspond to the concave section (O\u2013A), straight section (A\u2013B), slightly convex section (B\u2013C section), convex section (C\u2013D) and post-peak section (D\u2013E) of the 125\u00a0g sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n experimental curve.\nThe sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n has a great influence on the stress\u2013strain curve. With the increase of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, peak stress \u03c3\n\nc\n increases and peak strain \u03b5\n\nc\n (the strain corresponding to the peak stress) decreases, and the slope of the elastic phase of the curve increases. Compression time t has very little influence on the stress\u2013strain curve. The peak stress \u03c3\n\nc\n, peak strain \u03b5\n\nc\n and slope of stress\u2013strain curves corresponding to different compression times t are almost the same. The influence of vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n on the stress\u2013strain curve is different from that of the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n and compression time t. With the increase of vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n, the greater the peak stress \u03c3\n\nc\n and the greater the peak strain \u03b5\n\nc\n; the slope of the elastic phase of the curve basically remains unchanged.\n\n\n3.2.2\nMechanical properties\nUniaxial compression strength and deformation parameters of the sample were obtained by analysing the stress\u2013strain curve, as shown in Fig. 5\n. The higher the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, the greater the uniaxial compressive strength \u03c3\n\nc\n, the smaller the strain corresponding to peak strength, and the greater the elastic modulus E. Compression time t had no significant influence on peak stress \u03c3\n\nc\n, peak strain \u03b5\n\nc\n and elastic modulus E in the uniaxial compressive test, which is consistent with the effect of compression time t on the stress\u2013strain curve shown in Fig. 4. The influence of vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n on the strength and deformation parameters is partly consistent with the influence of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n on the strength and deformation parameters of the rock, but there are also differences. One is that the content of the sodium silicate has greater influence on the parameters than the vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n; the other is that peak strain \u03b5\n\nc\n decreases with the increase of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, while the effect of vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n is opposite. This also indicates that the influences of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n on rock brittleness are opposite.\n\n\n\n3.3\nTriaxial compression test results\n\n3.3.1\nDeviatoric stress\u2013strain curves\nIn Fig. 6\n, the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n has the greatest influence on the curve. This is different from the results shown in Fig. 4, where the curves of compression time t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n are opposite. With an increase in sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, peak stress \u03c3\n\nc\n increases and peak strain \u03b5\n\nc\n decreases, which is consistent with the effect of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n on the uniaxial compression curve. With an increase in compression time t, peak stress \u03c3\n\nc\n decreases and peak strain \u03b5\n\nc\n remains unchanged. With the increase of vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n, both peak stress \u03c3\n\nc\n and peak strain \u03b5\n\nc\n increase, which is consistent with the effect of vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n on the uniaxial compression curve.\n\n\n3.3.2\nMechanical properties\nAs shown in Fig. 7\n, the internal friction angle \u03c6 and cohesion c of red mudstone\u2013like materials increase gradually with the increase of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n. With the increase in compression time t, the internal friction angle \u03c6 and cohesion c remain unchanged. With the increase in vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n, the internal friction angle \u03c6 and cohesion c also increase, but the increase is less than that caused by the increased sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n. The research results here are only applicable to the case where the confining pressure range is 0\u20133\u00a0MPa.\n\n\n\n3.4\nFailure mode of red mudstone\u2013like material\n\n3.4.1\nFailure mode in uniaxial compression tests\n\nFig. 8\n shows the failure mode of red mudstone\u2013like material in the uniaxial compression test. The main failure mode of the red mudstone\u2013like material with low sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n is the splitting failure nearly parallel to the axial direction, which is tensile failure inside the rock sample. With the increase of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, the failure mode appears as the coexistence mode of longitudinal splitting and shear failure. When the mass of sodium silicate increases to 125\u00a0g, the failure mode of the red mudstone\u2013like material is mainly a shear failure through the rock sample. The failure modes of samples with different compression time t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n are similar to those of sample with medium sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n (75\u00a0g). They all have the failure mode of multiple shear cracks and tensile cracks.\n\n\n3.4.2\nFailure mode in triaxial compression tests\n\nFig. 9\n shows the fracture mode of red bed\u2013like material (taking the material with sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n of 75\u00a0g, compression time t of 6\u00a0h and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n of 80\u00a0MPa as an example) after the triaxial compression test. When the confining pressure is small, the failure mode of red bed\u2013like materials is generally the coexistence of splitting failure and shear failure, and the shear failure is the main failure mode. With the increase of confining pressure, the main failure mode of red bed\u2013like material is shear failure. When the confining pressure increases to 3\u00a0MPa, the failure mode of the red bed\u2013like material is a single shear crack through the whole rock sample.\n\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nComparison of red mudstone\u2013like materials with natural rocks\nRed mudstone\u2013like materials and natural rocks were compared in this study in terms of rock mineral composition, physical properties, and mechanical properties.\nThe sample used in this study was a red mudstone\u2013like material. Its mineral composition was the same as that of natural red mudstone, and the synthesis process was a mechanical compression method that does not cause chemical changes in the sample. Moreover, the added cement agent will not change the mineral composition of red mudstone like materials. This proves that the red mudstone like material synthesised in this study is a kind of mudstone in terms of mineral composition.\nBy comparing physical property indicators (dry density \u03c1 and wave velocity v) obtained in this study (Fig. 10\na and b), it can be seen that the dry density \u03c1 and wave velocity v of the red mudstone\u2013like materials are within the range of natural mudstone\u2013related properties (Ref.-1).\n22\n The dry density \u03c1 of mudstone in Ref.-1 are between 1.32 and 2.60\u00a0g\/cm3, and the dry density \u03c1 of red mudstone like material synthesised in this study are between 1.88 and 2.02\u00a0g\/cm3. The wave velocity v of mudstone in Ref.-1 are 1008.95\u20135008.13\u00a0m\/s, and the wave velocity v of red mudstone like material synthesised in this study are 1225.03\u20131945.31\u00a0m\/s. Moreover, the dry density \u03c1 of the red mudstone\u2013like materials is in the middle of the range of that of natural mudstone, and the wave velocity v of the red mudstone\u2013like materials is in the smaller part of the range of that of natural mudstone. This proves that the red mudstone\u2013like material synthesised in this study is a kind of mudstone in terms of physical properties.\nThe uniaxial compressive strength \u03c3\n\nc\n of the red mudstone\u2013like materials (Fig. 10c) is also in line with the classification of rock based on uniaxial compressive strength \u03c3\n\nc\n of the International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM), the International Engineering Geology and Environment Association (IAEG), the British Standards Institution (BS),\n23\n and with previous results from the Ref.-2 23. According to different classification standards, the red mudstone\u2013like materials synthesised in this study belong to the classification of very weak, weak and moderate\u2013weak rocks, with most of them belonging to the classification of weak rocks, which have greater uniaxial compressive strength \u03c3\n\nc\n than that of clay. Moreover, the uniaxial compressive strength \u03c3\n\nc\n of soft rock in Ref.-2 are between 5.61 and 34.22\u00a0MPa, and the uniaxial compressive strength \u03c3\n\nc\n of red mudstone like materials synthesised in this study are between 6.26 and 13.41\u00a0MPa except that the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n is 25g. It is proof that the red mudstone\u2013like material synthesised in this study is a kind of weak mudstone in terms of mechanical properties.\nThe comparison of cohesion c and internal friction angle \u03c6 obtained by triaxial compression tests in this study with those of natural red mudstone\n24\u201326\n is shown in Fig. 10d and e. Among them, the cohesion c of red mudstone in Ref.-3 and Ref.-4 are 0.87\u20133.04\u00a0MPa, and the cohesion c of red mudstone like material synthesised in this study are 0.93\u20132.89\u00a0MPa. The internal friction angle \u03c6 of red mudstone in Ref.-3, Ref.-4, and Ref.-5 are 7.01\u201347.83\u00b0, and the internal friction angle \u03c6 of red mudstone like material synthesised in this study are 28.76\u201345.31\u00b0. The cohesion c of red mudstone\u2013like materials is relatively small, and the internal friction angle \u03c6 is relatively large. According to the dispersion of the distribution of test results, the influence of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n on cohesion c and internal friction angle \u03c6 is greater than that of compression time t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n. It is proof that the red mudstone\u2013like material synthesised in this study is a kind of red mudstone with weak strength in terms of mechanical properties.\nIn summary, the red mudstone\u2013like materials in this study are consistent with the natural rocks in terms of mineral composition, dry density \u03c1, wave velocity v, uniaxial compression strength \u03c3\n\nc\n, cohesion c and internal fraction angle \u03c6. This proves that the synthetic method of this kind of red mudstone\u2013like materials is reasonable. The limitation of this method is that it can only synthesise red mudstone within a certain range of physical and mechanical properties. As shown in Fig. 10a, b, and c, the range of dry density \u03c1, wave velocity v and uniaxial compressive strength \u03c3\n\nc\n of red mudstone\u2013like materials is smaller than that of natural red mudstone.\n\n\n4.2\nQuantitative analysis of synthesis method\nHere, the quantitative analysis of the influence of sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, compression time t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n on the physical and mechanical properties of red mudstone\u2013like materials will be discussed, as well as the influence of three different factors on the properties of red mudstone\u2013like materials. The different diagenetic effects achieved by changing different factors will also be described.\nEquations (1)\u2013(7) show the relationship between sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, compression time t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n, and the physical and mechanical properties of red mudstone\u2013like materials established by multiple linear regression (In Equations (1)\u2013(7), R\n2 is the decisive coefficient of correction.). To compare the degree of influence of the three factors, the three independent variables are normalized. In this study, in order to obtain Equations (1)\u2013(7), the normalization process is to transform the dimensionless independent variables in Equations (1)\u2013(7) into dimensionless independent variables and become scalars; Equation (8).\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c1\n=\n0.35\n\nc\n\ns\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n\n1.89\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\nt\n+\n0.32\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n+\n1.78\n\n(\n\nR\n2\n\n=\n0.883\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nv\n=\n2671.93\n\nc\n\ns\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n201.49\nt\n+\n414.02\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n+\n1017.21\n\n(\n\nR\n2\n\n=\n0.914\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nc\n\n=\n32.88\n\nc\n\ns\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n0.84\nt\n+\n3.69\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n+\n0.44\n\n(\n\nR\n2\n\n=\n0.865\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03b5\nc\n\n=\n\u2212\n7.84\n\nc\n\ns\ns\n\n\n+\n0.53\nt\n+\n1.58\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n+\n3.52\n\n(\n\nR\n2\n\n=\n0.854\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nE\n=\n3113.89\n\nc\n\ns\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n94.67\nt\n+\n215.83\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\u2212\n92.72\n\n(\n\nR\n2\n\n=\n0.827\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\u03c6\n=\n50.12\n\nc\n\ns\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n7.07\nt\n+\n10.54\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n+\n22.34\n\n(\n\nR\n2\n\n=\n0.645\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\nc\n=\n6.90\n\nc\n\ns\ns\n\n\n+\n0.28\nt\n+\n1.74\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\u2212\n0.08\n\n(\n\nR\n2\n\n=\n0.882\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n\nX\nn\n\n=\n\n\n\nX\nr\n\n\u2212\n\nX\nmin\n\n\n\n\nX\nmax\n\n\u2212\n\nX\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere, X\n\nn\n is the normalized independent variables, X\n\nr\n is the independent variables before the normalization, X\nmax is the maximum independent variable before the normalization, X\nmin is the minimum independent variable before the normalization.\nTo test the reliability of the above equations, the theoretical calculation values under four special conditions in Table 2 (test NO. 1, 5, 6, and 9) are compared with the experimental values (Fig. 11\n). It can be seen that, except for case I, the relative error of elastic modulus E is larger; the other theoretical values are very close to the experimental values. It shows that red mudstone with different physical and mechanical properties can be obtained by changing the independent variables in Equations (1)\u2013(7).\nBy normalising the coefficients of independent variables in Equations (1)\u2013(7) using Equation (8), the degree of influence of independent variables on dependent variables can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 12\n. The sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n has the greatest influence on the physical and mechanical properties of red mudstone\u2013like materials, and then the vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n and compression time t. This is consistent with the qualitative analysis of the test results. Note that all the above results are only applicable to the diagenetic method shown in this study when the sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n is 25\u2013125\u00a0g, the compression time t is 3\u20139\u00a0h, the vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n is 40\u2013120\u00a0MPa, and the confining pressure in triaxial tests is 0\u20133\u00a0MPa. If the research results need to be applied to a wider field, further tests are needed to verify the reliability of the above results.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, red mudstone\u2013like materials were synthesised based on sodium silicate content c\n\nss\n, compression time t and vertical stress \u03c3\n\nv\n with the aim of studying the physical and mechanical properties of soft rocks. The following are some major findings.\nThe synthetic red mudstone\u2013like materials have similar physical and mechanical properties to those of natural red mudstone.\nSodium silicate content c\n\nss\n is one of the most important factors governing mechanical properties, such as internal friction angle \u03c6, of the synthetic red mudstone\u2013like materials.\nThe developed synthesis method could potentially be widely implemented in rock mechanics research.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 41977230),

The methane (CH4) concentration in under\u2013ice surface water before and during the storm event was 8\u201312\u00a0nmol\u00a0L\u22121, which resulted in a potential sea\u2013to\u2013air CH4 flux ranging from +0.2 to +2.1\u00a0mg CH4 m\u22122 d\u22121 in open leads. CH4 ventilation between seawater and atmosphere occurred when both open water fraction and wind speed increased. Over the nine days after the storm, sea ice grew 27\u00a0cm thick. Initially, CH4 concentrations in the sea ice brine were above the equilibrium with the atmosphere. As the ice grew thicker, most of the CH4 was lost from upper layers of sea ice into the atmosphere, implying continued CH4 evasion after the leads were ice\u2013covered. This suggests that wintertime CH4 emissions need to be better constrained.\n               ","1":"\n                  Study of sediment sources and transport pathways in the Chukchi and East Siberian Seas is vital for understanding the interaction of fluvial, ocean, and sea-ice dynamics. In this study, 42 samples were analyzed for heavy minerals and 23 were analyzed for garnet geochemistry. These analyses suggest that the surface sediment is mainly sourced from the surrounding rivers. There are distinctive performances between the heavy minerals and garnet geochemistry of sediments in the Chukchi Sea and the East Siberian Sea. The content of hypersthene increased significantly on the outer shelf of the Chukchi Sea. The garnet was derived from volcanic rocks of the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic province and transported from the Gulf of Anadyr by the Pacific inflow. Coastal erosion materials dominated in the inner shelf of the Chukchi Sea. A significant amount of river input occurred in the western, middle, and eastern parts of the East Siberian Sea. The inputs from the Indigirka River and Kolyma River tend to be distributed eastward. The garnet geochemistry shows that there was a mixed sedimentary zone located south of Wrangel Island. The sediments in the outer shelf of the East Siberian Sea show a stable mixed sedimentary environment.\n               ","2":"\n                  Ripening berries are one of nature's important contributions to people in the Russian Far East. We examined the spatiotemporal variability of people's interests in 12 types of berries and their attributes by accessing Yandex statistics (Yandex) and Google Trends (GT) about these topics in the Russian Far East. On Yandex, time-series data for people's interests in many berries for all target regions showed clear seasonal changes, with an annual peak that occurs at the time of ripening. Interest in berries was observed in many cities and regions in the far east of Russia, where indigenous peoples and Sakha traditionally utilize berries for subsistence. The attributes of accessed terms were closely related to terms about berry varieties and edible berries, berry purchases, photographs, and recipes. These results supported the usability of Yandex and GT data to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of people's interests in berries. Despite systematic biases, such as in the Internet environment and user characteristics as well as limitations of spatial resolution and access period, the integrated use of Yandex and GT should be developed to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of people's interests in berries, especially in areas that are difficult to access.\n               ","3":"\n                  A comparison study on underwater noise at the Chukchi plateau with and without ice cover helps to understand the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean, especially in the context of global warming. Underwater noise recorded at a receiving depth of 519.5\u202fm, from September 9, 2017 to March 8, 2018, on the Chukchi Plateau had been investigated. When the sea surface was ice-free, underwater noise on the Chukchi Plateau was dominated by wind-generated noise for high wind speed and there was no significant shipping in this sea area. When the sea surface was ice-covered, underwater noise was dominated by ice-generated noise. Under open-water conditions, the noise spectrum means and percentiles were greater than those under ice-covered conditions. The differences of mean and median levels between open-water and ice-covered conditions were all almost less than 3\u202fdB in the range 20\u2013100\u202fHz; whereas, they were greater than 3\u202fdB in the 100 Hz\u20132 kHz band and increased with increasing frequency. Although the transient signals generated by sea ice activities would cause the noise spectrum level to increase suddenly under ice-covered conditions, the underwater noise was still shown relatively quiet compared with that under open-water conditions.\n               ","4":"\n                  The Hudson Bay exerts a strong advective influence on the surface energy balance of the adjacent Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of Canada. The onshore winds are relatively cold and moist compared to the warmer and drier offshore winds. The contrasting thermal and humidity properties of these two air masses affect the partitioning of net radiation between the various heat fluxes over the HBL. We show that global warming has been accompanied by significant changes in the mesoscale wind regimes and the advective role of the Hudson Bay on the surface energy balance over the HBL. On average, we found a significant increasing trend in onshore wind frequency during the growing season of about 7% over the past 40 years. The most pronounced increase in onshore winds of 17% occurred in June during which ice cover on Hudson Bay has remained highly persistent over the past 40 years. The resulting shift from offshore to onshore winds dominance over the region has resulted in an enhancement of convective heat transfer to the atmosphere and a reduction of conductive heat transfer into the ground.\n               ","5":"\n                  Loss of stratospheric ozone has occurred over the last half a century due to catalytic destruction by halogen-containing anthropogenic compounds. Saturated ozone loss events, when the ozone concentrations decreased to less than or equal to 1\u00a0mPa (>95% ozone loss), were studied across nine stations in Antarctica using the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument onboard the satellite Aura. The satellite observations were corrected using in situ ozonesonde observations to quantify the saturated ozone loss between 2004 and 2020. The analysis shows that at some stations the original MLS observations underestimated the number of loss events by 5\u201310%, however, at other stations they were overestimated by the same margin. A couple of stations showed a very good match between the original and corrected MLS data. Irrespective of the bias, the number of loss events decreased gradually from 2004 to 2013 suggesting a recovering trend. After 2013, no significant trend is visible, with large variation seen for especially between 2015 and 2019. The interannual variation was strongly coupled to the temperature, highlighting the key role that polar stratospheric clouds play in causing saturated ozone loss.\n               ","6":"\n                  Russian High Arctic archipelagos still lack knowledge on the freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity.

Freshwater lakes and streams along with associated coastal habitats were examined for hydrochemistry, elemental composition of sediments, microbiota, macrozoobenthos, flora and vegetation as well as ornithofauna. Despite the harsh climate conditions and ephemeral character of the freshwater bodies, there were a diverse microflora and macrozoobenthos. Macrozoobenthos consisted primarily of chironomid larvae (with highest abundances at 6644.4 specimens\/m2 and wet biomass hereinafter referred biomass 3.1\u00a0g\/m2) and enchytraeids (abundances up to 922.2 specimens\/m2, biomass up to 0.2\u00a0g\/m2); additionally, numerous mermitides were found in two sites; and tardigrades were found in a single water body. Grass-moss and moss communities in coastal habitats were described. We propose to include freshwater bodies of Franz Josef Land in the CBMP network, which at the moment lacks any monitoring sites in the Russian High Arctic, and has the only site at comparable latitudes in the Arctic Canada.

Informations of present forest variables i.e., stem diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), and detailed tree-ring data obtained from selected sampled trees were used. Development of forests structure in the past, and their annual changes were reconstructed (i.e., aboveground biomass, annual biomass growth, and stand density). Reconstructed aboveground biomass showed that the beta-type distribution function of individual tree size in the forests has been maintained throughout the years in the past. Several fluctuations in biomass growth over time were also observed. Reconstruction showed that stand density generally decreased overtime in P. sylvestris, which is a typical pattern for overcrowded population, but keeps increasing in P. mariana. Long-term reconstruction of stand structure can provide important baseline information for forest ecology and any management or restoration activities in the point of view of climate change.

By bioanalyzing the air mass at an altitude of 1000\u00a0m, the air mass near the ground, puddle water, and sand near the sampling point, microorganisms in the class of Bacilli and Chloroplast were found to have been transported over a long range from western Antarctica over Syowa Station in eastern Antarctica.\n               ","15":"\n                  Recent fingerprints of Alaskan Arctic climate change include new weather patterns whose impacts propagate through the Alaskan marine ecosystem. Multiple lines of observational evidence draw attention to the last five years (2017\u20132021) as a remarkable period of change. Bering Sea winter and spring ice coverage was remarkably low in 2018 and 2019 associated with a shifted Aleutian Low (AL) into the western Bering Sea, and ridging of the overlying polar jet stream (PJS) that supported southerly winds and reduced ice growth. The climatological Beaufort High and associated Beaufort Gyre saw multiple winter-long collapses (2017 and 2020), the only two such events of the modern reanalysis era. In contrast, from 2012 to 2016 the AL and PJS were located southeastward across the Gulf of Alaska, which supported sea ice growth. The recent collocation of the exposed ocean surface and atmospheric anomalies supports the emergence of a regional atmospheric circulation response to sea-ice loss.

The diet of the species has previously been described as being highly flexible, but whether this flexibility is a constant trait through time, or merely reflects fast temporal changes in abundance among prey taxa, has so far been poorly resolved. Using molecular analyses of arctic fox scats from Northeast Greenland, we first examined the temporal dynamics of arctic fox diets during the short snow-free season, and then examined whether local food availability at different sites affected arctic fox dependence on lemmings. Arctic fox diets included most terrestrial vertebrate species found in the region, and exhibited substantial temporal changes, generally reflecting the dynamic changes in prey availability from late winter through autumn. This dietary flexibility was also reflected geographically, with arctic foxes consuming a variety of local prey (mainly waterfowl and lemmings) in summer. Moreover, the dietary response of arctic foxes to changes in lemming abundance depended on access to non-lemming prey. Based on these findings, we discuss whether varying degrees of lemming-dependency, combined with geographical differences in winter food availability, may explain previously published differences in arctic fox breeding patterns in high arctic Greenland.\n               ","17":"\n                  The Antarctic Peninsula is a region of the world where drastic impacts of climate change have been observed over the past few years, leading the communities inhabiting this area to adapt to new conditions.

The community was represented by three groups: small-sized copepods such as Oithona similis and Ctenocalanus citer, salps such as Salpa thompsoni, and the Euphausiacea. Euphausiacea showed an important decrease in composition and abundance and was only represented by Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura. An increase in the abundance and distribution of S. thompsoni was observed over the entire study area, as well as positive SST anomalies, which possibly favored the increase in the S. thompsoni population, as well as the decrease and displacement of Euphausiacea adults and juveniles.

To examine the joint effects of these major, regional-scale hydrological freshening events on oceanographic processes, we compared physical (CTD, tides and currents) and biological (zooplankton) data measured in 2004 and 2013 in Academy Bay, Sea of Okhotsk. Our results indicate that the difference in sea water temperature between the two years played a primary role in shaping zooplankton variability. Data collected in 2013 showed that water temperature was colder and that the upper layer was substantially fresher (\u223c4\u20135 ps\u03bc) than in 2004. This decrease in water temperature and salinity reduction was accompanied by a significant decrease in the abundance of some key zooplankton species including Calanus glacialis, Pseudocalanus spp. and Sagitta elegans and a corresponding increase in the abundance of Limacina helicina. Delayed melting of sea ice in 2013 potentially triggered a mismatch in pelagic production that may have impacted the recruitment of calanoid copepods.

Average bacterial density was estimated as 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells\/mL but the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was essentially lower - (3.2\u20139.2)x103\u00a0cells\/mL. Totally, 83 stable strains were isolated and identified using phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequences and phenotypic traits. Main groups were the Gram-negative Pseudomonas and Duganella species as well as Gram-positive Arthrobacter spp. Besides, eubacteria Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium, Clavibacter, Aquaspirillum, Polaromonas, Actinibacterium, Shewanella, Kocuria and families Comamonadacea, Actinobacteridae were found. Genetic diversity of the bacteria was elevated with plasmids of different lengths in 33 strains but no correlation between the plasmids content and antibiotic resistance was found. Among cold-adapted enzymes antioxidant catalases (91.5%), peroxidases (57.5%), alkaline phosphatases (42.2%) prevailed; unspecific exonucleases were revealed in 16.9% strains and restriction endonucleases of type II - in 8.4% strains only. Lypases were detected in 24 strains (28.9%) and could facilitate membrane fluidity at low temperatures.

Using a probability density function and examining the mean and standard deviation of SIE distributions as a function of seasonality. Results show that the whole Southern Ocean presented both mean and standard deviation growth in all seasons. The largest SIE distribution difference for Southern Ocean between 1982\u20131993 and 2006\u20132017 periods was observed in July, August and September (JAS), during which all individual Sea sectors presented growth of the SIE mean. Not only different Sea sectors showed different variations, but the SIE data distributions from the same Sea sector yielded different changes with differing seasons. January, February and March (JFM) together with April, May and June were the seasons with the largest SIE decadal variability for Weddell, Indian, Amundsen and West Pacific Sea Sectors, while the Ross Sea showed greater SIE variability during JAS and October November, December.

Another purpose was to evaluate the responses of hyphal growth to temperature and the profiles of substrate utilization of fungal isolates under pure culture conditions. A total of 46 fungal isolates were obtained and grouped into eight taxa, with Phoma herbarum being the most frequent taxon, the occurrence of which was closely related to the nitrogen level of the substrata. The colony diameter growth rates of most fungal isolates under pure culture conditions increased linearly with temperature to reach the maximum at 20\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating that these fungi were mesophilic. Moreover, fungal isolates exhibited diversity and redundancy in their utilization of 71 carbon sources, having potentials to utilize an array of substrates including sugars, sugar alcohols, hexose-phosphates, amino acids, hexose acids, and carboxylic acids.\n               ","36":"\n                  First-year ice ridge has been examined with respect to geometry and morphology at the Barneo ice camp in April 2013.

Significant fragment in the keel of ice ridge is fully consolidated, its draft reaches to 5.8\u00a0m but the fragment's upper boundary is located at the sea level. This indicates the presence of hydrostatic unbalance. Away from the point of maximum keel draft on the cross-section, the average porosity of the unconsolidated part of the keel tends to increase, but again decreases at the periphery of the keel.

The Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) geochronology of lateral, recessional and ground moraines has provided proper evidence of episodic deglaciation and corresponding landform evolution of the region. The field disposition ground moraines exhibit the existence of a vast glacier system before 52 ka and successive different stages of its recession in the Late Quaternary time.

The initial ice-structure interaction process is commonly idealized as a bending failure of semi-infinite ice sheets. Existing theoretical models either assume a breaking pattern of radial-before-circumferential cracking, or that of a circumferential-before-radial cracking. However, field observations indicate that the breaking pattern depends on various factors. For generic applications of real-time simulators, the determination of breaking patterns is thus an essential first step towards reasonable ice load predictions. This paper addresses the current research gap by considering a normalized formulation of the ice sheet bending failure. The locations and orientations of the maximum principal stresses at the upper and bottom surfaces of a semi-infinite ice sheet are obtained, from which the criterion for breaking pattern determinations is determined. It is found that factors such as large structure waterline curvature radii, small ice thicknesses, large ice flexural strengths, and small ice compressive strengths induce a breaking pattern of circumferential-before-radial cracking. Conversely, small structure waterline curvature radii, large ice thicknesses, small ice flexural strengths, and large ice compressive strengths result in a breaking pattern of radial-before-circumferential cracking.\n               ","43":"\n                  Out of 4530 glaciers covering \u223c4770\u00a0km2 in the Upper Indus Basin, viz., Chenab, Zanaskar and Suru sub-basins, we selected topographically and morphologically homogeneous set of 98 glaciers; 56 debris-covered and 42 clean to assess the impact of debris-cover on glacier melting.

Meteorological data was analysed (daily temporal and diurnal variation) for 2018, and the water balance components were estimated for January\u2013February of 2018. The present work revealed the status of meteorological parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and snowfall) at Schirmacher Oasis compared to long-term historical trends at the east and west regions of Antarctica.

The Atlantic water prominent in the fjords showed strong inter-annual variability. The Atlantic water and summer freshwater volume (FWV) were more in the Kongsfjorden, with the FWV being 1.4\u20132.0 times more than 0.08\u20130.71\u00a0km3 in the Krossfjorden. The Krossfjorden had a two-layer structure with warm less-saline surface waters above cold high-saline waters in early summer. The fjord transformed to a three-layer system with warm high-saline waters between cold less-saline surface and cold high-saline deep waters in peak summer and fall. The Krossfjorden temperature showed east-west variability, with a warmer eastern side. Numerical simulations show that the warm Atlantic water from the West Spitsbergen current enters the Krossfjorden through its eastern side, supplying heat to the inner fjord. An outflow is also observed along the western Krossfjorden.

The fundamental ice flow laws are used to estimate the ice outflux or discharge for selected ice stream drainage basins of cDML at fluxgate locations. The ice stream basin has been delineated using combination of elevation, slope and continental scale velocity maps. The ice influx for study area is estimated using ECMWF fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5) and Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) v2.3 model outputs.

The temperature variations along the year are periodic, and hence attempts are made to express the seasonal variations with a combination of periodic function (Fourier components); which are used as boundary conditions to reach the analytical solutions. The temperature measurements from surface to about 10 metre of depths at the Baydaratskaya Bay, Kara Sea are available. We adopted a data-driven model based on simplified analytical closed-form solution derived from the boundary conditions.

The study region is divided into grids that results into unique nodes, which are studied for sea ice parameters and wind velocity. Resistances caused due to ice and wind are considered to calculate expected ship velocity between nodes. The calculated ship velocities are then used to estimate durations to cover distances from a node to all the neighboring nodes. It forms a mathematical route from source to destination through various nodes with time as weight that is then optimized through Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain optimal route.

Several protective and ecological functions such as cryoprotection, anti-desiccation, buffering against high salinity and pH, trace metal uptake and binding, sequestration of dissolved organic matter and nutrients, aggregate formation and biofilm production have been attributed to microbial EPSs. They also contribute to production of dissolved and particulate organic matter and hence can influence biogeochemical cycling of elements, especially carbon and iron. Further, they aid in aggregation of dust particles on the glacier surface, substantially reducing the albedo of the ice and thereby accelerate melting of glaciers. This study provides an overview of role of EPSs in Antarctic ecosystems, its ecological significance and chemical functionalities, and discusses the approach for a better understanding of relevance of EPSs in biogeochemistry of Antarctic environments.\n               ","74":"\n                  The Arctic climate system is very sensitive to external perturbations, which results in more rapid surface air temperature (SAT) changes in the Arctic compared to lower latitudes. This study aims at assessing the performance of global climate models from the phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) in reproducing the periods of Arctic warming and cooling known from the observations. Two experiments are considered for 9 CMIP5 models, and one experiment is used for the 108 ensemble members from 32 CMIP6 models. The ensemble mean of unforced Arctic amplification variability in the CMIP5 pre-industrial control experiment suggests a crucial role of external forcings in the present Arctic amplification. The ensemble mean of the same models in the historical experiment shows a century-long upward trend and clearly reproduces the present-day Arctic amplification. However, there is no consistent response of increasing Arctic amplification in the early twentieth century warming period during the 1920s\u20131940s in the CMIP5 models. This indicates the 1920s\u20131940s Arctic warming was unlikely to happen due to external forcings. Using the large CMIP6 ensemble in the historical experiment we show that the multi-model ensemble mean in the new generation of high-resolution CMIP6 models does not reproduce that warming either, thus posing questions how well the models capture internal climate variability and distinguish it from natural and anthropogenic forcings. This issue ultimately affects the reliability of future Arctic climate projections.\n               ","75":"\n                  The role of antennas in the detection of atmospheric conduction current has been discussed since the beginning of the 20th century. Propriety of the antenna design needs to be reviewed from time to time as the measurements experience different problems on various terrains. The present work deals with such issues and brings out a suitable antenna design to detect the conduction current observed at the Indian Scientific Research Station at Maitri (70.8\u00b0S 11.7\u00b0E), Antarctica. Two long wire antennas and two plate antennas are simultaneously used to monitor the air-Earth current in the open space at this station. The experiments reveal that the currents recorded by the long-wire antenna and plate antenna display similar characteristics but differ in the magnitude and the response to the varying current. On a fair-weather day the mean current density obtained by 41\u00a0m long-wire antenna is ~0.4\u00a0pA\u00a0m\u22122, 10\u00a0m long-wire antenna is 2.5\u00a0pA\u00a0m\u22122, 0.25\u00a0m2 plate antenna is 3.5\u00a0pA\u00a0m\u22122, and 1\u00a0m2 plate antenna is 4.2\u00a0pA\u00a0m\u22122. The current sensed by 1\u00a0s and 1000\u00a0s R\u2013C time constant do not show any significant difference in the hourly mean diurnal variation as well as in the magnitude. The study reveals that a plate antenna is a better option for the long term monitoring of air-Earth current. The simultaneously monitored potential gradient at this station and Vostok (78.4\u00b0 S, 106.8\u00b0 E) are used to identify the local and global electric signals.\n               ","76":"\n                  Understanding of the coastal waters of Antarctica is crucial in determining the ocean-ice system response to climate change. In this study, using hydrography data we have provided the observational evidence of anomalous warming (>1\u00a0\u00b0C) in the Prydz Bay during austral summer. Even though the warming was centred at 68\u00b0S, 74\u00b0E, the presence of warmer waters were also noticed close to the Amery Ice Shelf. The study further explored the causes and impact of this anomalous warming using satellite and re-analysis data. It was suggested that the advection of warmer waters towards the shelf region of the Prydz Bay between 72\u00b0E and 75\u00b0E was the main driver for the mixed layer warming. The surface heat flux played a weak role in the observed warming. The warm water advection and surface circulation during the observation period were anomalous compared to the normal pattern. The analysis further confirmed that warming caused a drastic reduction in sea-ice and chlorophyll in the Prydz Bay region.

The vertical profile of BC shows two peaks in winter, one at 1 km and the other strong peak at higher altitude of 12.5 km associated with long-range transport from mid-latitude and tropical regions, while in summer one peak at lower altitude is found.

Examination of mafic granulites from Sostrene Islands - Larsemann Hills - Brattstrand Bluffs terrain indicate multiple sources for their protolith. The ensemble of mafic rocks intimately associated with sedimentary protoliths are sourced from older mafic crust as well as syn-sedimentary intrusives, prior to multiple stages of deformation and high-grade metamorphism, often including felsic melt generation. High-grade metamorphism (peak conditions of ~900\u00a0\u00b0C and 11\u00a0kbar) followed by two stages of decompression, which are indicated by the presence of symplectitic growth of orthopyroxene over garnet and in cracks in garnetiferous mafic granulite. Pseudosection modelling confirms that the mafic granulites underwent a near isothermal decompression of ~2\u20133\u00a0kbar, indicating a clockwise PT path. Chemical dating of monazites from associated paragneisses show three growth zones viz. a Grenvillian aged core (884\u2013940\u00a0Ma) followed by a thin Upper Tonian- Cryogenian aged middle rim (689\u2013754\u00a0Ma) and a typical Pan African aged outer rim (523\u00a0Ma).

SAT in February in central Asia has decreased by more than 7\u00a0\u00b0C compared to that in normal years. Analysis indicates that cold events over central Asia are related to the weakening of the polar vortex, which is indicated by the increase in polar cap height (PCH) and weaker zonal-mean zonal winds. The increase in PCH begins in January in the stratosphere and propagates down to the troposphere in February; it is well reflected in the weakening of zonal-mean zonal winds in the stratosphere in January, which extends to the troposphere in February. The January increase in PCH anomaly is associated with surface conditions in the Arctic region, especially the Barents\u2013Kara seas, where sea level pressure increases substantially in January; high pressure then expands to the southeastern (downstream) branch of the Siberian high in February, bringing cold eastern Siberian air to central Asia.\n               ","80":"\n                  We compare the sediment magnetic properties of two lakes in Schirmacher Oasis, East Antarctica and discuss the intensity of pedogenesis during the Late Quaternary.

The magnetic grains of Lake L-49 are much smaller in size compared to Lake Sandy's (low ratio values of IRM20mT\/ARM and S20 ). The iron oxide minerals in Lake Sandy's sediments are coarse stable single domain (SSD) and multi-domain (MD) grains with the SSD concentration increasing during the Holocene. Percentage frequency-dependent susceptibility, a marker for pedogenic iron oxide minerals shows a similar trend for Lake Sandy, with the values remaining low during the Last Glacial Stage (LGS) and increasing towards the Holocene. Such a pattern is not observed in the sediments of Lake L-49. Principal Component Analysis reveals a relatively stronger intensity of pedogenesis in the Lake Sandy catchment during the deglaciation. From the data, we observe that even though pedogenesis is active, the intensity is not strong enough to form superparamagnetic (SP) grains.

The importance of winter CH4 oxidation to the soils in these regions has previously been recognized; in this study, concentrations of CH4 and 222Rn were observed in the snowpack and underlying cold temperate soils during the winters of 1995\/96 and 1996\/97. These observations were carried out in order to 1) validate the 222Rn tracer as a proxy for variations in CH4 diffusivity within a snowpack containing many seasonal ice lenses, and to 2) estimate winter CH4 oxidation through the snowpack to the soils. Winter CH4 oxidations estimated by snow density (method 1); using the 222Rn tracer under steady (method 2) and non-steady (method 3) conditions; and using a static chamber (method 4) during the winter of 1996\/97 yielded 16.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3; 8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9; 9.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4; and 4.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0mg CH4\u2013C m\u22122, respectively. These results suggest that contributions from average CH4 oxidation represent 23.3% (range: 12.7\u201335.1%) of the annual CH4 oxidation into cold temperate soils. Wintertime CH4 oxidation significantly reflects temporal variation in the snowpack, demonstrating that soil temperature depends on snow cover, and that a threshold snow depth of 40\u00a0cm does not prevent, but rather promotes, atmospheric CH4 oxidation through snowpack to the soils. These findings demonstrate that the 222Rn tracer was useful for estimating winter CH4 diffusivity and oxidation, using a one-dimensional vertical diffusion box model in cold temperate soils in Japan during multiple snow-covered seasons.\n               ","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"\n                  This article proposes the mapping of the concentration of sea ice in the oceanic region of the western Antarctic Peninsula using backscatter coefficients and textural features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) C-band, horizontal single polarization (HH) images obtained by the Sentinel 1\u00a0A satellite sensor.

According to our calculations, the total value of buildings and structures in the Russian Arctic permafrost zone will be about US$133.5 billion by the second half of the 21st century.

SR-XCT and TEM observations revealed that both FGM and FGR contain abundant amorphous silicate embedding nano-inclusions (most are Fe\u2013Ni sulfide). Although the amorphous silicate is more or less hydrated based on the analysis of the X-ray linear attenuation coefficients in SR-XCT, there are no areas filled by abundant phyllosilicate even in three dimensions.

Our findings demonstrate that stem respiration is a significant component in the scale-up of the regional carbon budget in a black spruce forest of interior Alaska.\n               ","103":"\n                  This study aims at examining the following research questions: What has been the record of Russia's Arctic Council membership by the present-day moment? How has Russia's role evolved? What have been some of the main issues, agreements, disagreements, challenges and problems? What is Moscow's agenda during the Russian Council chairmanship in 2021\u20132023? The author identifies the following priorities for Russia's Arctic Council presidential agenda: climate change action; sustainable socioeconomic and environmental development; social cohesiveness and connectivity in the region; indigenous peoples; conservation of biodiversity; science diplomacy; Council's partial institutional reform. Moscow will probably try to make the Arctic Council's budget, including specific project budgets, more transparent and systemized. The Russian presidency aims to make the role of permanent participants and observers in the Council's activities more visible. At the same time, Moscow will avoid its former claims to transform the Council from an intergovernmental forum to a full-fledged international organization and bring military security problematique to the Council's agenda. Russia's chairmanship will try to strengthen the Arctic Council's role in asserting regional stewardship by responding to the challenges of a rapidly changing Arctic and the increasingly more integrated policy frameworks from local to global scales.\n               ","104":"\n                  The trajectory of land surface wetness is one of the most consequential unknowns in the Arctic climate system. The present analysis is intended to (1) document seasonal and interannual variations of surface moisture fluxes, (2) clarify the drivers of P-ET variations among Arctic vegetative types, and (3) evaluate the effects of wildfire disturbance on ET. The analysis is based on field measurements from sites in boreal forest and tundra ecosystems of Alaska. The surface moisture budget at boreal forest sites in permafrost areas generally shows a moisture deficit in late spring and early summer, followed by a moisture surplus from late summer into autumn. The annual net P-ET is generally positive but can vary interannually by more than an order of magnitude. The primary drivers of variations in evapotranspiration over weekly to monthly timescales are radiative fluxes, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. Overall, the ET at forest sites shows a stronger dependence on relative humidity and wind speed, while ET at tundra sites shows the stronger dependence on air temperature. These differences imply that tundra sites are more temperature-limited and forest sites are more humidity-dependent. Relative to a nearby unburned site, a burned forest site in interior Alaska shows an increase in ET for nearly a decade following the fire, while the recovery time for ET at a burned tundra site is only about three years.\n               ","105":"\n                  We conducted gravity observations in Antarctica at Jang Bogo Station (JBS) during the 2019\u20132020 Austral summer season using an FG5-210 absolute gravimeter (AG) and a LaCoste & Romberg (LCR) Model D-58 relative gravimeter. Absolute gravity measurements were successfully made at reference gravity point JBSAG1 and newly established gravity point JBSAG2, yielding about 19,000 and 14,400 drops of data, respectively, with measurement precisions better than 0.4 \u03bcGal (1 \u03bcGal\u00a0=\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22122). In addition, relative gravity measurements were conducted at 10 other newly established gravity points, with accuracies better than 10 \u03bcGal, to supplement the absolute gravity data. Superconducting gravimeter (SG) observation with an iGrav-021 instrument has been underway at JBS since 2016. Since an SG is a relative gravimeter, the calibration of the scale factor is essential for long-term gravity monitoring. In addition, the D-58 instrument was required for scale factor calibration. To calibrate the scale factors of these gravimeters, we first estimated a value for the iGrav-021 using parallel observations with the FG5-210 instrument. The D-58 scale factor was then estimated indirectly from parallel observations with the iGrav-021. These calibrations should ensure accurate gravity monitoring in future work.\n               ","106":"\n                  The glacimarine processes in the Western Antarctic Peninsula have been intensified since the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d. These have been recorded in the distribution and shape of glacial submarine landforms and glacial sub-bottom stratigraphy. In this study, the dominant factors of the past ice flow behaviour and glacimarine sedimentary processes in B\u00f6rgen Bay, Anvers Island, are identified and analyzed. The results indicate that the outer bay linear features are associable to the past ice flow during the Last Glacial Maximum. After that, a general deglaciation period occurred, with some readvances and short stillstand, interpreted by the presence of moraines and small transverse ridges. The presence of \u201cpinning points\u201d on the coast, could affect the glacier movements and favour the generation of moraines. Differences in the ice flow behaviour between the bay arms, are due to factors such as bathymetry, and the size of the drainage basin and glacier front. Main sedimentary processes are ice-rafting and subglacial flows, marked by chaotic seismic facies, and gravity flows identified by monticulated and transparent seismic facies, and also sediment plumes contribution, creating laminated facies in the proximal area basins. Those sedimentary mechanisms and landforms agree with a wet polar climate, but some of them would indicate a warmer climate shifting, that is necessary to prove with systematic future measurements.\n               ","107":"\n                  Antarctica is one of the most effective sites to measure the impact of human isolation, sleep deprivation, light-dark period and harsh environmental conditions. In the present study we address several aspects of the activation and regulation of the complement system. Alterations in the body systems mainly related to immunology, physiology and psychology, during expeditions to the Antarctica, leads to various complexities. In the present study the research findings are based on two group members from 34th Indian Scientific Expedition to the Antarctic. The first group-included members from \u201csummer\u201d expedition, while the second group-included members subjected to the Antarctic environment for the \u201cwinter\u201d expedition. Blood samples were collected from both the groups and evaluated for various activation and regulatory complement protein. Serum levels of C3, C4 & C5a were analysed. Anaphylatoxin C3a was up regulated significantly in both the teams. However, C5a, another anaphylatoxin was also increased in both teams though not significantly during winter expedition. Complement regulatory proteins C1- Inhibitor, Factor D, Factor H were unregulated significantly during summer and winter exposures. However, Factor D levels increased significantly only in the month of April (W2) of summer exposure. Thus, this indicates that harsh Antarctic conditions could be detrimental factor for activation of complement system in both the teams. However, the effect of activated complement system during the expedition was regulated in positive manner and could not be correlated with clinical manifestations due to the multiple stressors and small population size during Antarctic expedition.\n               ","108":"\n                  An in situ measurement system was developed for continuous observations of the mole fractions of atmospheric oxygen (defined as \u03b4(O2\/N2)) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and the continuous observation was conducted onboard the research vessel SHIRASE 5003 during its voyage between Australia and Syowa Station, Antarctica, in 2017\u20132018. The CO2 variation was low with respect to that of \u03b4(O2\/N2) in the Southern Ocean, suggesting that the land biospheric and fossil-fuel derived CO2 and O2 emissions negligibly influenced the observations. Therefore, the observed significant variations in the atmospheric O2\/N2 can be attributed to the atmosphere-ocean gas exchange. During the southbound voyage in December 2017, we observed large spatial variations in \u03b4(O2\/N2) due to marine biological production on the western side of the cruise track. Oceanic O2 fluxes based on a simple model and atmospheric \u03b4(O2\/N2) variability were consistent with past oceanic observations. No clear longitudinal gradient in \u03b4(O2\/N2) was observed at latitudes toward south of 60\u00b0 S in December 2017 and February\u2013March 2018. However, local \u03b4(O2\/N2) maxima were observed in regions with active marine biological production in December 2017. These observations indicate that local O2 fluxes can also modify the spatial distribution of atmospheric \u03b4(O2\/N2) in the Southern Ocean.\n               ","109":"\n                  The Sakha Republic is the largest region of the Russian Federation by territory. At the same time, it is also considered one of the most sparsely populated regions. Because of the Republic's size and relatively small population, the Russian government included the Republic in the Far-Eastern Hectare Law (FEHL) in 2016 in order to repopulate and render productive the region. According to this law, any Russian citizen can apply for and receive a 1-ha land plot in the Sakha Republic for free. Expectedly, the Far Eastern Hectare Law caused mass discontent amongst Sakha residents and has led to ongoing protests. This article examines the contested understandings of land and property in the text of the FEHL and the daily practices of Sakha residents, as well as the demands and rhetoric of Sakha's protesters. Turning land into property through FEHL is a form of land and territorial dispossession (Harvey, 2004; Coulthard, 2014). This article argues that the FEHL violates the rights of the Sakha people to use their native lands. The land conflict between the federal government and the inhabitants of the Sakha Republic resulted in the emergence of a new concept in the social and political space of the Republic: ancestral lands. In turn, this new concept has led to a reexamination of the definition of Indigenous peoples in the Sakha Republic.\n               ","110":"\n                  Green spaces have recently received wide acknowledgement for urban sustainability benefits and are mentioned in the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs Target 11.7.

Different indicators implemented by international organizations for assessment of green spaces are compared with indicators used in Russia. Utilizing very high-resolution WorldView-3 satellite image and open source data, the quantity and quality of green spaces are estimated with high accuracy. In addition to traditionally used indicators of share of green space per capita, share of public spaces for common use within walking distance to assess availability and accessibility of green spaces, the paper suggests importance of taking into account governance, distribution, and composition using analysis of historic legacies, municipal budget allocation for green space maintenance, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values.

Associated with warming are changes in snow, sea ice and hydroclimate, all which have significant impacts on environments and society. However, due to short observational records, it is difficult to set the current climate in a long-term context. Arctic driftwood (DW), available throughout the Holocene, is a paleoclimate resource that may shed information on past sea-ice, ocean current and atmospheric conditions because it is transported by sea ice across the Arctic. Moreover, DW tree-ring data can be used to interpret climate in the boreal forests where the trees grew. Here we present a study of 380 DW samples collected on eastern and south-western Svalbard. Combining species identification and dendrochronology, it was found that the DW mainly consisted of Pinus sylvestris, Picea sp. and Larix sp. (87% of all samples), mainly originating from northern Russia. In total, 60% of the DW could be dated and their provenance determined, and four tree-ring width chronologies representing Yenisei and Dvina-Pechora were constructed, facilitating extension and improvement of the existing chronologies representing those regions. Moreover, DW from relict beaches that can be subjected to dendrochronological analyses, provides possibilities to extend pan-Arctic tree-ring data even further back in time. Because there are several processes governing the temporal patterns of wood deposition in the Arctic, using DW as an indicator of sea-ice variations needs further investigation.\n               ","112":"\n                  High-resolution data on spatial variations in the productivity of bryophytes and the mass of the organic layer are important components in geochemical models for northern forests.

The forest floor on the 600\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0600\u00a0m slope was classified into four types, i.e., Classes I\u2013IV, characterized mainly by the dominance of leaf litter, H. splendens, Pleurozium schreberi, and Sphagnum spp., respectively. Spatial autocorrelation analyses showed clustering patterns for some tree and forest floor variables, which were associated with the distribution of the four classes on the slope. Mean growth (length) rates of H. splendens were high in Class II, while growth rates by weight were high in Class I due to a high weight-to-length ratio of shoots. The thickness of the organic layer in bryophyte patches ranged from 6.0 to 40.7\u00a0cm and was also controlled by slope orientation.

In this study, we screen seven major open-data GNSS networks to identify the sites which are suitable for using GNSS-IR to study the permafrost areas in the Arctic. We identify 23 usable sites and obtain their surface elevation changes. As for the unusable sites in the permafrost areas, 68% and 25% of them are due to undulated reflecting surface and obstructions (e.g., buildings and trees), respectively. And 7% of the unsuitable sites are due to insufficient usable observations, though open and relatively smooth areas can be found in their surroundings. This study provides usable sites in the Arctic permafrost areas, which can fill some spatial gaps of the existing permafrost monitoring programs and provide complementary measurements to active layer thickness and permafrost temperature.

This method estimates the relatively slowly changing landscape component and the rapidly changing climate component of the discomfort. Transitional natural zones represent an open system for the impact of climatic changes. A positive trend in the number of active temperatures and a negative precipitation trend was observed in these regions. At present, the climate conditions of some areas in the tundra, forest-tundra, and northern taiga correspond to the more southerly landscape zones. This situation is conducive to changes in the landscape vegetation and could lead to a shift in the transitional landscape zone borders towards higher latitudes. The relevancy of the study results is that they help to establish the potential consequences of climate change for landscape structures, as well as for the environment and the population of the Northern and Arctic areas.

At the time of writing, over 8000 marine species currently considered valid have been recorded from the Southern Ocean (De Broyer et al., 2021). However, benthic sampling has been largely restricted to the shallower continental area, while less is known about the deep-sea fauna (e.g. abyssal plain; Griffiths, 2010).\nThe R\/V Hakuho Maru of the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute (AORI), The University of Tokyo and Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) is a Japanese research vessel capable of operating various biological and geological survey equipment in the deep sea. She has conducted many scientific research cruises worldwide since 1989. From November 2019 to March 2020, an around-the-world cruise of R\/V Hakuho Maru was carried out to mark her 30th anniversary, during which geological and benthic biological surveys were conducted in and around the Southern Ocean (leg 4 of cruise KH19-06 and leg 1 of cruise KH20-01), with a particular focus on sampling the West Antarctica region.\nHere, we present occurrence records and taxonomic accounts of Annelida, Mollusca, Ostracoda, Decapoda, and Echinodermata based on benthic samples collected by geological dredges and multiple corers. Although the benthic diversity of West Antarctica is among the most heavily sampled (Griffiths, 2010), our results include potential undescribed species and extensions of distribution ranges and improve our understanding of the benthic fauna in the Antarctic and high latitude regions approximately south of 45\u00b0S \u2013 key areas for the ongoing cataloging of global marine biodiversity.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\nThe samples were collected during two research cruises of R\/V Hakuho Maru, leg 4 of KH19-06 and leg 1 of KH20-01 (Figs. 1 and 2A\n\n). Specimens of benthic fauna were obtained from depths of 1367\u20136277\u00a0m by geological dredge, multiple corer, and baited trap (attached to a geological dredge) from the deep seafloor in and around the Southern Ocean. Three types of geological dredges were used on-board R\/V Hakuho Maru: the \u201cBarrel type\u201d (BD) with a 0.6\u00a0m aperture and a 2\u00a0m long steel chain collecting bag (Fig. 2D), the \u201cSatsuki type\u201d (SAD) with an aperture size of 0.8\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0m and a 1.2\u00a0m long steel collecting box (Fig. 2E), and the \u201cSquare type\u201d (SQD) with an aperture size of 0.8\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0m and a 3\u00a0m long steel-chain collecting bag (Fig. 2F). A total of 20 dredge stations were selected between 1619 and 5835\u00a0m depth offshore of the South Orkney Islands and off the west of the Bullard Fracture Zone during leg 4 of cruise KH19-06, and between 1367 and 2740\u00a0m deep off the south side of Marion Islands and offshore of the Amery Shelf during leg 1 of cruise KH20-01 (Fig. 1). Plankton nets with a mesh size of 300\u00a0\u03bcm were laid inside the steel collecting bags in all dredges. A bait trap, attached on the frame of SAD (Figs. 1 and 2B), was carried out between 6272 and 6277\u00a0m deep off the east side of Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands. For the multiple corer (Fig. 2C; with eight cores 8.2\u00a0cm in diameter and 60\u00a0cm in length), 14 sampling stations were set between 1062 and 6271\u00a0m offshore of the South Shetland Islands in the northwestern Weddell Sea, Agulhas Ridge area during leg 4 of cruise KH19-06 (Fig. 1).\nSamples collected were spread out in large plastic boxes, and large organisms were picked out immediately. The boxes were then filled with seawater and minute suspended animals were screened by a fine net with a mesh size of 0.3\u00a0mm. The remaining samples were screened using 16\u00a0mm, 4\u00a0mm, 2\u00a0mm, and 1\u00a0mm mesh sieves. The samples were sorted again under a binocular or naked eye in the laboratory on-board. Samples were photographed where possible, and then preserved 80% or 99% ethanol or fixed in 8\u201310% neutralized seawater formalin or frozen in \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C with seawater.\nPreserved animal specimens were morphologically identified at laboratories in Japan by taxonomists according to their specialties: Annelida by NJ, Mollusca by CC, Ostracoda by SFH, Decapoda by HK, Crinoidea by GAP, Asteroidea by IK, Ophiuroidea by MO, Echinoidea by HT, and Holothuroidea by AO. Specimens collected in this survey were deposited in the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tsukuba (NSMT) and Invertebrate Collection of the Hokkaido University Museum (ICHUM). In addition to those taxa with taxonomic expertise in the present study, the animals sampled also include specimens of unidentified Porifera, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, Bryozoa, Brachiopoda, Nematoda, Pycnogonida, Lepadomorpha, Tanaidacea, Isopoda, Euphausiacea, and Notothenioidei. These are to be published elsewhere in future studies.\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\nA total of 180 benthic species were recognized from the sampling efforts in the present study in the groups we had expertise in, including: 66 species of Annelida, 23 species of Mollusca, 31 species of Ostracoda, 1 species of Decapoda, 3 species of Crinoidea, 11 species of Asteroidea, 26 species of Ophiuroidea, 3 species of Echinoidea, and 17 species of Holothuroidea (Tables 3\u201311). The list of sampling sites in this study is shown in Table 1\n, and the numbers of benthos species collected are summarized in Table 2\n. The most species-rich station was St. D07 (west off the South Orkney Islands, 3565\u20133979\u00a0m in depth), where 47 species were identified (Table 2). Species lists of taxonomic groups investigated in this study are provided in Tables 3\u201311, and photographs of representative specimens of each species are displayed in Figs. 3\u201310. The identification results in this study are summarized as follows, with remarks on specific taxa of interest. One annelid species, Flabelligena hakuhoae\nJimi et al. (2020), has already been described using part of the materials used herein (Jimi et al., 2020). Further analyses and observations for other potentially new species are still ongoing. Our results shows that small-sized macrobenthos such as Annellida and Ostracoda contains a considerable number of undescribed species, and the taxonomic diversity of these taxa in West Antarctica is still underestimated.\nOur study, though limited in scale, showed that unknown species diversity is still very much evident in deep-sea habitats of the Southern Ocean, even in the West Antarctic region where sampling has been more extensive than in other regions (Griffiths, 2010). This implies that much more awaits our discovery in the less-studied regions, such as East Antarctica. Future research on the Antarctic biodiversity warrants focusing on deep-sea systems.\n\n3.1\nTaxonomic accounts\n\nPhylum Annelida\n\nSee Fig. 3\n, Table 3\n.\n\nRemarks. A total of 66 annelid species were found in the examined specimens, including 34 families. All specimens examined in the present study were in families conventionally considered to be polychaetes. Recent faunal analysis by Neal et al. (2020) showed that over 230 annelid species are known from around the Falkland Islands. All annelid specimens studied herein were collected by dredging during leg 4 of the cruise KH19-06. Based on these specimens, Flabelligena hakuhoae\nJimi et al. (2020) was described, and was the first record of Flabelligena from the Southern Ocean (Jimi et al., 2020). Although the genus Pelagobia is a pelagic group, Pelagobia sp. was collected by dredging and suggests that this species may be benthopelagic. Orbiniella sp. is similar to O. annulata described from the Southern Ocean by Hartman (1967), but some minor differences in prostomium and segment morphology require further study. The flabelligerid genus Diplocirrus is distributed all over the world. Only one species, Diplocirrus sp. n. Antarctica sensu\nSalazar-Vallejo and Buzhinskaja (2011), has been known from the Southern Ocean. In the present study, we found three species of Diplocirrus and all specimens are not identical with Diplocirrus sp. n. Antarctica sensu\nSalazar-Vallejo and Buzhinskaja (2011). Further morphological observations are needed for the specimens in order to understand the biodiversity of flabelligerids in the Southern Ocean.\n\nPhylum Mollusca\n\nSee Fig. 4\n, Table 4\n.\n\nRemarks. A total of 23 molluscan species were found in the examined specimens, including 10 species of bivalves, 12 species of gastropods, and one species of scaphopod. No other molluscan classes were found in the materials examined in the present study. Among these, one bivalve species, three gastropod species, and a single scaphopod species were taken in subantarctic waters during leg 1 of cruise KH20-01, while the rest were collected in the Southern Ocean during leg 4 of cruise KH19-06. Our record of Acesta sp. fragments (Fig. 4A) from subantarctic waters of 51\u00b048\u2032S is among the most southern records for this genus of large limid bivalves, for which only a single verifiable record exists from the Southern Ocean (Piazza et al., 2016). The trochoid snail Antimargarita smithiana was known almost exclusively from East Antarctica between 95\u00b0 and 114\u00b0 (Engl, 2012), with only a single record from West Antarctica in the Bellingshausen Sea (Aldea and Troncoso, 2008); our record of this species from 20\u00b041\u2032W is a first from the Weddell Sea. This greatly extends its known distribution range and suggest it may be circumpolar in distribution. However, it should be noted that the specimen examined (Fig. 4R) was broken and would benefit from confirmation by further, future sampling from this area. We also provide a surprising record of the seguenzioid snail Calliotropis antarctica from subantarctic waters (51\u00b048\u2032S 39\u00b058\u2032E, 1524\u00a0m deep; Fig. 4P), this species has previously only been collected from the Southern Ocean (Engl, 2012).\n\nPhylum Arthropoda\n\n\nClass Ostracoda\n\nSee Fig. 5B\u2013E\n, Table 5\n.\n\nRemarks. A total of 31 ostracod species were found in the examined specimens, from 11 families. All specimens were collected by dredging during leg 4 of cruise KH19-06. Ostracods are known to occur from the surface to the deep sea in all oceans, and exhibit diverse morphologies. Kornicker (1975) listed 122 species in 25 genera from the Southern Ocean up to 35\u00b0S. Some species have been studied using phylogeographic methods to reveal their distribution in the Southern Ocean (Brand\u00e3o et al., 2010). However, the total ostracod fauna in the Southern Ocean, includes many undescribed species, and much still remains to be learned. Among the species belonging to Halocyprida, mostly were of the swimming type and species of the genus Conchoecia were abundant with at least 12 individuals of three species found. Four species of the benthic genus Macroscapha, including Macroscapha opaca Maddocks, 1990 and Macroscapha aff. walterae Brand\u00e3o et al., 2010, were found. Due to their small body size, many ostracods are often missed by the standard dredge equipment. Some of them were collected using plankton nets laid inside dredge equipment in the present study, including small species of Krithidae and Bythocytheridae. The high species number of ostracods indicate a high diversity in the region. However, based on this collection, it seems that optimization of sampling gear would enhance collection of small and pelagic species which have likely been underestimated.\n\nClass Malacostraca\n\n\nOrder Decapoda\n\nSee Fig. 5A, Table 6\n.\n\nRemarks. Only one decapod species, Nematocarcinus lanceopes Bate, 1888 (Nematocarcinidae) (Fig. 5A), was found in the crustacean collection made by leg 4 of cruise KH-19-6. Previously, eleven deep-sea decapod species including an unidentified Nematocarcinus species recorded by Zarenkov (1968), have been recorded from the Southern Ocean southward to the Antarctic Convergence (Komai et al., 1996). Nematocarcinus lanceopes is common and widely distributed around Antarctica. It has a wide vertical distribution from the Antarctic continental slope down to the abyssal plains of the Southern Ocean at 4,000\u00a0m deep (Thatje et al., 2005).\n\nPhylum Echinodermata\n\n\nClass Crinoidea\n\nSee Fig. 6\n, Table 7\n.\n\nRemarks. Three crinoid species were recognized from the examined specimens (n\u00a0=\u00a03): 2 species were collected from two dredge stations in leg 4 of cruise KH-19-06 and another species was collected from one dredge station in leg 1 of cruise KH20-01. At present, 44 species, including two species not identified to species level, have been recorded from the Southern Ocean (El\u00e9aume et al., 2014). Two families are recognized from the examined specimens: Thalassometridae (1 species) and Antedonidae (2 species). The thalassometrid specimen collected has a close affinity to the tropical genus Parametra but requires further study to confirm. The bathymetric range of one antedonid species, Eometra weddelli John in Vaney and John (1939), is extended to 5835\u00a0m, making it the deepest known depth record among Antarctic comatulids.\n\nClass Asteroidea\n\nSee Fig. 7\n, Table 8\n.\n\nRemarks.\nMoreau et al. (2018) summarized collection events from the years 1872\u20132016, totaling 28 families, 118 genera and 299 species of Asteroidea from Antarctic and subantarctic waters south of 45\u00b0 latitude. We recognized 11 species from 17 specimens collected at five dredge stations during leg 4 of the cruise KH19-06 and leg 1 of cruise KH20-01. In particular, the five korethrasterids specimens (NSMT E-13816, Fig. 6H) were obtained from 60\u00b029.73\u2032 S, 43\u00b07.43\u2032 W, 3184\u00a0m deep to 60\u00b030.55\u2032 S, 43\u00b06.96\u2032 W, 2328\u00a0m deep, which were identified to the genus Peribolaster Sladen, 1889 based on having cruciform abactinal plates with abactinal spines exhibiting conical or spatulate tips. However, our five specimens have morphological characteristics different from any of the four valid congeners and require further taxonomic study.\n\nClass Ophiuroidea\n\nSee Fig. 8\n, Table 9\n.\n\nRemarks. In total, 184 individuals were collected in leg 4 of cruise KH19-06 (n\u00a0=\u00a0170) and leg 1 of cruise KH20-01 (n\u00a0=\u00a014), containing at least 26 species. Of these, 17 were identified to species-level (including Ophiacantha cf. setona, Ophiocten cf. ludwigi, Ophiura cf. flagellate, Ophiura cf. imprudens and Ophiura cf. mimaria), 4 to genus-level, and the remaining 3 to family-level. For the other 4, since the specimens were either fragmented (NSMT E-13778) or juveniles (NSMT E-13776, 13777, and 13779), taxonomic characters for identification lower than the class-level were unavailable. Previously, 220 species of ophiuroids have been recorded by multiple surveys since the nineteenth century from the Antarctic and subantarctic settings (Mart\u00edn-Ledo and L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2014; Okanishi and Mah, 2020). Among these, 106 species are believed to be restricted to subantarctic regions, and the Ophiuroidea is considered to be an important group in the subantarctic benthic settings in terms of diversity and biomass (Mart\u00edn-Ledo and L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2014).\nOf the species identified in this study, Amphiophiura covexa, Ophiacantha cuspidata Ophiacantha opulenta, Ophiacantha simulans are recorded as newly occurring species from Antarctic waters. Additionally, although the exact identification still remains uncertain, Ophiacantha cf. setona and Ophiura cf. imprudens should be added to the list of recorded species from this region. One specimen preliminarily identified as the genus Neoplax (NSMT E-13786) has not previously been recorded from Antarctic waters. However, we here refrain from adding this genus to the fauna of the Antarctic waters, since the examined specimen lacked sufficient characters for a positive determination of Neoplax. Further detailed morphological observations of the ossicles, such as lateral arm plates and\/or DNA analysis are required to clarify the identifications of those specimens, and to update our knowledge of the fauna of brittle stars in the Southern Ocean.\n\nClass Echinoidea\n\nSee Fig. 9\n, Table 10\n.\n\nRemarks. A total of three species of echinoids, Aporocidaris milleri (A. Agassiz, 1898), Sterechinus sp., and Urechinus naresianus A. Agassiz, 1879, were found in this study.\nAntarctic echinoids are relatively well studied and there is a database based on records from 1872 to 2015 for the Southern Ocean, including the Antarctica and subantarctica (Fabri-Ruiz et al., 2017). Three species\/genus sampled in this study were common in records from the extensive previous sampling conducted in the same area.\n\nClass Holothuroidea\n\nSee Fig. 10\n, Table 11\n.\n\nRemarks. At present, 163 described holothurian species (plus at least 14 undescribed species) from 55 genera have been recorded from the Southern Ocean (Bonn and Hess, 2014; Davey and Whitfield, 2013; Mackenzie et al., 2021; O\u2019Loughlin and VandenSpiegel, 2010; O'Loughlin and Whitfield, 2010; O'Loughlin et al., 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015a, 2015b). Seventeen species were recognized from about 25 examined specimens (several specimens were damaged and fragmented during sampling and therefore the number of actual individuals examined is only an approximation) collected from four dredge stations sampled during leg 4 of cruise KH19-06. These records extend the bathymetric ranges of two species including Sigmodota contorta (Ludwig, 1875) and Cucumaria dudexa O\u2019Loughlin & Manj\u00f3n-Cabeza, 2009, and the latter is also the first record from the Atlantic part of the Southern Ocean. Although not identified to species level, Psolus sp. represents the deepest record for the genus. The genus Ypsilicucumis is reported here from the Southern Ocean for the first time, represented by two species. Previously, Ypsilocucumis have only been described from low-latitude areas in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The present specimens therefore greatly extend the geographic distribution of the genus; these newly collected specimens warrant further studies with regards to their relationships to the described species.\n\n\n\n4\nConclusion\nWe carried out taxonomic identification of Annelida, Mollusca, Ostracoda, Decapoda, and Echinodermata retrieved from 20 geological dredges, 14 multiple corers, and a bait trap survey on-board two cruises of the R\/V Hakuho Maru, focusing primarily on West Antarctica. We identified a total of 180 species, with detailed sampling localities for each \u2013 including a number of potentially undescribed species and extending the bathymetric or geographic distribution ranges of several species. Smaller-sized macrofauna groups such as Annelida and Ostracoda were found to contain more likely undescribed species, suggesting smaller-bodied taxa require more concentrated efforts and improved sampling methods. There are also other taxa collected in our samples such as sponges, corals, bryozoans, pycnogonids, isopods that still require detailed identification. Thorough taxonomic and distributional information of all deep benthos groups collected by the R\/V Hakuho Maru cruises is warranted in the future to compare with existing West Antarctic biodiversity collections, in order to provide an overview of how these new collections add to our knowledge of Southern Ocean deep-sea biodiversity and to elucidate areas to focus in future sampling cruises.\n\n","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is the only endemic terrestrial predator in the Arctic (Fuglei and Ims, 2008). Holding a central position in the terrestrial trophic interactions on the tundra (Ehrich et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2017), the arctic fox is regarded as a flagship species by the IUCN, and has been identified as an indicator of climate-induced changes in biotic interactions in arctic and alpine regions (Sillero-Zubiri and Angerbj\u00f6rn, 2009). The species is therefore a focal species of many long-term research and monitoring efforts across the circumarctic region (Berteaux et al., 2017). Throughout their distributional range, arctic foxes are regarded as opportunistic generalist predators, feeding on a variety of prey species (Angerbj\u00f6rn et al., 1999; Giroux et al., 2012; Samelius et al., 2007), which has also been reported from high arctic Greenland (Dalerum and Angerbj\u00f6rn, 2000; Gilg et al., 2006). Arctic fox diets vary markedly geographically, and in some areas, such as Scandinavia and some sites in Greenland, lemmings constitute the major part of arctic fox diets (Elmhagen et al., 2000; Gilg et al., 2006). In areas where lemmings are absent, carcasses of large mammals and avian prey may dominate their diets (Eide et al., 2005), and where several alternative prey species occur, these species may form the largest proportions of arctic fox diets (Bantle and Alisauskas, 1998; Tarroux et al., 2012).\nTraditionally, the diet of the arctic fox has been inferred from hard part analyses (Dalerum and Angerbj\u00f6rn, 2000; Eide et al., 2005; Gilg et al., 2006). More recently, these estimates have been supplemented by analyses of stable isotopes of arctic fox tissues (Carbonell Ellgutter et al., 2020; Ehrich et al., 2015; Giroux et al., 2012). While such methods provide valuable information about fox diets, the taxonomic resolution is often low. Additionally, larger prey which is not consumed whole may leave no identifiable hard parts.\nDuring the last few decades, molecular methods have been introduced as efficient tools for overcoming taxonomic issues (Monterroso et al., 2019). As a potential drawback, they provide less quantitative or biased dietary information (Clare, 2014). Recent studies, however, suggest that the general diet composition can be inferred from the relative read abundances of the various taxa consumed, recovered from for instance scat samples (Deagle et al., 2019).\nIn this study we use molecular analysis of arctic fox scats collected in high arctic Greenland to document the diet of arctic foxes. First we ask whether the previously reported dietary flexibility of the arctic fox also reflects the rapidly changing prey availabilities during the short snow-free season in the high Arctic. During the snow season, we expect arctic foxes to rely mainly on resident vertebrate prey, and in particular on muskox (Ovibos moschatus) carcasses (Schmidt et al., 2008), as well as cached prey (Fay and Stephenson, 1989; Samelius et al., 2007). During the snow-free season, we expect lemmings and migratory birds to provide the main diet (Reneerkens et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2008). We then ask whether regional variation in both lemming prey and alternative food sources across high arctic Greenland is directly reflected into different arctic fox diets. To this aim, we compare arctic fox diet composition at three sites in Northeast Greenland with contrasting prey compositions and availabilities. Finally, we discuss how geographical differences in lemming and non-lemming prey availability might translate into arctic fox breeding patterns in Greenland.\n\n\n2\nMethods and data\n\n2.1\nField sampling\nFor examining the seasonal patterns in arctic fox diet, we collected arctic fox scats at Zackenberg in high arctic Greenland (74\u00b028\u2032N, 20\u00b034\u2032W) from the months April through October. The study area consists of a broad valley close to a fjord, and covered with a mosaic of typical tundra vegetation types, mainly heaths and graminoid-dominated vegetation (Elberling et al., 2008). The vertebrate food web is centred around the lemming, the only rodent in Greenland. In addition to arctic fox, the lemming-predator guild consists of mainly long-tailed skua (Stercorarius longicaudus), snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) and stoat (Mustela erminea) (Schmidt et al., 2012). The availability of non-lemming prey is given in Table 1\n. Upon arrival to the area in late winter, we cleared the seven known arctic fox breeding dens at Zackenberg for scats. Hereafter we collected fresh scats on the dens at weekly visits. Fresh scats encountered by chance away from dens were also collected. In the summer months, only scats from adult foxes were collected (based on scat size). Scats were placed in individual tubes and either stored frozen or in ethanol until processing. Most scats were collected in the 2012 season, but to increase our sample size we also included scats from other years (see below). During the years 2010\u20132015, fresh scats from the summer months (June through August) were collected at Zackenberg to allow for inter-site comparisons of arctic fox diets.\nTo assess differences in diets between sites in Northeast Greenland, we collected arctic fox scats at two additional sites, Hochstetter Forland (75\u00b015\u2032N, 19\u00b070\u2032W) and Karupelv (72\u00b050\u2032N, 24\u00b000\u2032W) (Fig. 1\n), characterized by contrasting prey availability in summer and winter (Table 1). Hochstetter Forland is a large lowland, dominated by graminoid-dominated vegetation types (Meltofte et al., 1981), while Karupelv is a broad valley close to a fjord, covered with mainly heath vegetation types (B\u00fcntgen et al., 2018). As at Zackenberg, the lemming is key for the vertebrate predator-prey dynamics and dominated by the same predators, though snowy owls are more frequent at Karupelv (Schmidt et al., 2012). Non-lemming prey is also available at both sites, but mainly at Hochstetter Forland (Table 1). At both sites fresh scats from adult foxes were collected opportunistically at known breeding dens (six dens at Hochstetter Forland and five at Karupelv) and when encountered in the field during the summer months (June through August) during the years 2010\u20132015. Scats from first visits to the dens were disregarded. At Karupelv and Hochstetter Forland, samples were air-dried and stored dry until processing. Unfortunately, small sample sizes prevented us from examining the inter-annual variability in diets at these sites. We therefore divided the years into lemming \u201chigh\u201d years (more than 2 lemmings per hectare) or lemming \u201clow\u201d years at each site (Gilg et al., 2003; Therrien et al., 2014). We calculated the density of lemmings in spring based on counts of winter nests following Gilg et al. (2019, 2009). Lemming high years for Karupelv were 2011 and 2012, 2012 for Zackenberg, and 2013 for Hochstetter Forland. At all three sites we also classified the relative availability of non-lemming prey in the area into three categories based on field observations: low (limited availability, rare occurrence), intermediate (intermediate availability, occasional occurrence) or high (high availability, frequent occurrence).\n\n\n2.2\nMolecular analyses\nWe excluded scats collected at fox dens at first visit to the dens as these could not be adequately assigned to a month, and ended up extracting DNA from 380 arctic fox scats. For each scat, we retained only information concerning the target prey taxa: Birds, mammals, and fish. We removed all reads assigned to Canidae (i.e. arctic fox, potentially wolf Canis lupus) as we do not know whether these stem from cannibalism, grooming or from sloughed cells. Our final dataset thus consisted of 3,361,848 prey reads assigned to prey taxa. We were able to retrieve meaningful prey data from 319 out of the original 380 (84%) scat samples. The rest of the samples only contained bacterial or other non-target reads. Hence, for the examination of temporal changes in diet, a total of 139 scat samples were included (April: n\u00a0=\u00a014, May: n\u00a0=\u00a014, June: n\u00a0=\u00a031, July: n\u00a0=\u00a019, August: n\u00a0=\u00a029, September: n\u00a0=\u00a023, October: n\u00a0=\u00a09). Ca. 80% of these scats were from 2012. For the inter-site comparison of arctic fox summer diets, a total of 225 scats collected in June through August were included (Karupelv: n\u00a0=\u00a053; Hochstetter Forland: n\u00a0=\u00a047, and Zackenberg: n\u00a0=\u00a0125).\nDetails on the extraction and PCR methodologies and library preparation can be found in Appendix A, but a short summary is included here. DNA was extracted from 380 (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a095) Arctic fox scat samples plus four negative controls (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01) using ZR 96 Kits (cat nr D6011, Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) following kit manual. The purified DNA was then amplified using three different primer pairs, as follows. First primer was meant to amplify mammalian mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), and we used a blocking primer in the reaction to prevent fox DNA to be co-amplified. A blocking primer is a specific oligo, that binds to the non-wanted DNA, here fox DNA, and is modified so that amplification in the PCR is not possible or is significantly reduced. Another primer pair was targeting bird mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (CytB), and no blocking primer was used in this reaction. The third primer pair was designed based on all Greenland animal sequences, targeting vertebrate mtDNA COI gene, and a new blocking primer was designed against fox DNA amplification. After thorough testing, our final PCR and library preparation followed Vesterinen et al. (2018), with primer-specific PCR conditions. For each primer pair, the first PCR phase amplified the desired locus, and the subsequent second PCR stage was used to attach Illumina specific adapters and sample-specific index combinations. All the indexed samples were pooled per primer pair and purified using magnetic SPRI beads (Vesterinen et al., 2016). Sequencing was performed on two distinct runs. The first run included Fox-Mam\u00a0+\u00a0Fox-Bird pool (together with another library from an insect study) and was sequenced at the facilities of Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea) on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq4000 flow cell using 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150bp run. The second run included the COI-Prey pool on Illumina NextSeq500 platform at the Functional Genomics Unit of the University of Helsinki, Finland, using Mid Output with 300 cycles and 2 \u00d7 150 bp paired-end read length.\n\n\n2.3\nBioinformatics\nThe raw sequence output was uploaded to CSC servers (IT Center for Science, www.csc.fi) for trimming and further analysis. The platform-specific steps varied between primer pair outputs, and the details of each step have been collected into the supplements. In short, we identified 306 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for Fox-Mam, 526 OTUs for Fox-Bird, and 6392 ZOTUs for COI-Prey. ZOTUs (zero-radius OTUs) do not practically differ from traditional clustering of OTUs (which are based on pre-set percentage threshold), but the UNOISE algorithm performs better in (i) removing chimeras, (ii) PhiX sequences and (iii) Illumina artefacts according to Edgar and Flyvbjerg (2015). The OTUs from COI region were assigned to taxa based on two different resources: 1) the Barcode of Life Data systems API engine (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007), which we accessed using custom-made scripts (see Vesterinen et al., 2020), and 2) the GenBank nt database, against which we BLASTed (Altschul et al., 1990) our sequences before importing the results to software Megan for lowest common ancestor (LCA) analysis (Huson et al., 2007). CytB reads were assigned solely by BLAST followed by the LCA approach. The final dataset consisted of 500,644 reads in the Fox-Mam OTU table, 8,419,225 reads for Fox-Bird OTU table, and 11,955,842 reads for COI-Prey.\n\n\n2.4\nData treatment\nWe used the number of taxa-specific DNA reads as indicator of the relative contribution of each taxon to arctic fox diets. To account for varying number of reads per scat, we first normalized the number of reads of prey types within each scat (i.e. number of reads per prey taxon divided by total number of reads in the scat). This metric has been reported to yield an adequate representation of diet composition (Deagle et al., 2019). To characterize general temporal (monthly) variation in arctic fox diet at Zackenberg, we normalized the number of reads from each prey type within each month. Similarly, to examine diets in high lemming and low lemming years at the three sites, we calculated the normalized read fraction for each prey taxon within each site and lemming density (lemming high or low years). Following Angerbj\u00f6rn et al. (1999), dietary fractions were converted into \u201cwhole scat equivalents\u201d (WSE), which take into account the relative contributions from the various prey items whilst having the number of scats as sample sizes as in ordinary frequency of occurrence analyses. We then compared statistically the dietary composition between months, sites and between high and low lemming density years at the three sites using Likelihood Ratio Tests (G-test). Taxa with low WSE numbers were lumped together to meet the requirements of the test.\nFinally, we calculated the dietary niche breadth for each month and for each site in the two lemming densities using Levin's measure (B) (Krebs, 1998):\n\n\n\nB\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\u2211\n\nP\nj\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere P\n\nj\n is the proportion (based on the normalized reads in the scats) of prey taxa j in each month or site. Levin's measure ranges from 1 (only one prey taxa consumed) to the maximum number of prey taxa consumed (i.e. all prey taxa consumed in equal amounts).\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nThe three sites examined here varied markedly with respect to the relative availability of both lemming prey and alternative food sources (Table 1). Mean lemming spring density was highest at Karupelv, intermediate at Hochstetter Forland and lowest at Zackenberg. Moreover, Hochstetter Forland and Zackenberg had similar amplitude in lemming fluctuations, whereas Karupelv lemmings exhibited an amplitude 5\u20136 times higher than the two other sites (Table 1).\nWe grouped prey taxa encountered into nine prey groups based on taxonomy or, in the case of \u201cOthers\u201d, their low frequencies in scats (Table 2\n). Most scats held between 1 and 3 prey taxa (n\u00a0=\u00a0255), but up to nine prey taxa were found (n\u00a0=\u00a01).\nAt Zackenberg, the temporal changes in arctic fox diet from late winter (April) to late autumn (October) were considerable (Fig. 2\n). Not all monthly diet compositions differed significantly, but generally diets in the months April through August were more similar, whereas diets in the months September and October were more similar to each other (Appendix A\nTable S1). Hence, in late winter diet consisted mainly of muskox, but waterfowl, ptarmigans, lemmings and fish were also consumed. In the following months, muskox was still consumed but were less frequent, and diets were dominated by waterfowl, fish and lemmings. Hares and small passerines also constituted substantial fractions of diet during the snow-free season, whereas remaining prey taxa were only consumed in small amounts. In September, muskox, waders and fish constituted the main parts of diet. In October, muskox and fish made up the major fraction of the diet, but waterfowl were still relatively important (Fig. 2). The dietary niche breadth (Levin's (B)) varied markedly between months (Fig. 2). Niche breadth was highest in late winter\/spring (May\u2013June), after which it decreased steadily as waterfowl became increasingly important as prey during summer. In early autumn (September), niche breadth increased sharply again, likely because most waterfowl have migrated South and foxes thus have to rely on other prey species. Thereafter, niche breadth declined again as muskox carcasses became the dominant prey in winter (Fig. 2).\nAlthough arctic foxes consumed a variety of prey taxa in summer at all three sites examined, the general composition of summer diets differed significantly between sites (Fig. 3\n; G between 19.971 and 29.309, df\u00a0=\u00a08, and p between 0.000 and 0.010). Hence, arctic foxes mainly consumed waterfowl at Hochstetter Forland, lemmings at Karupelv, while at Zackenberg they consumed a broader variety of taxa dominated by waterfowl, muskoxen and lemmings. The impact of lemming abundance on arctic fox diet was most pronounced at Karupelv (i.e. where alternative prey is lowest in summer; Table 1), and the dietary composition in high versus low lemming years differed significantly (G\u00a0=\u00a018.887, df\u00a0=\u00a04, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Hence, arctic foxes responded to low availability of lemmings by consuming fewer lemmings and more small passerines as compared to years with high lemming abundance (Fig. 3). At Hochstetter Forland, lemmings were less important than at Karupelv. Nonetheless, arctic foxes still responded to changes in lemming abundance, and less waterfowl were consumed in lemming high years as compared to lemming low years. Nonetheless, dietary composition in lemming high and low years did not differ significantly (G\u00a0=\u00a04.625, df\u00a0=\u00a04, p\u00a0=\u00a00.328). At Zackenberg, the contributions of waterfowl and lemmings were similar in lemming high and lemming low years (Fig. 3). Small passerines were consumed more in lemming low years, whereas muskox was recovered only from scats in lemming high years. Remaining prey groups did not differ notably between lemming low and lemming high years at Zackenberg. The significantly different dietary composition between lemming high and low years at Zackenberg (G\u00a0=\u00a023.838, df\u00a0=\u00a06, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) thus appears mainly attributable to differences in consumption of muskox. The site-specific dietary responses to lemming abundance were also reflected in the dietary niche breadth (Fig. 3). Hence, at Hochstetter Forland arctic fox diets was broader in lemming high years, whereas the diet in lemming low years was dominated by waterfowl. At Karupelv, dietary width was slightly increased in lemming low years, mainly due to a more equal contribution of lemmings, small passerines and waterfowl. At Zackenberg, the dietary width remained stable despite the fluctuations in lemming abundance (Fig. 3).\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThe diets of arctic foxes in Northeast Greenland included most terrestrial vertebrate species found in high arctic Greenland. This observation confirms previous findings from other techniques suggesting that the species relies on a broad diet (Angerbj\u00f6rn et al., 1999; Dalerum and Angerbj\u00f6rn, 2000; Fay and Stephenson, 1989; Garrott et al., 1983; Gilg et al., 2006; Giroux et al., 2012; Samelius et al., 2007; Tarroux et al., 2012). Yet, arctic fox dietary composition changed markedly during the course of the year. In late winter, the main resources for arctic foxes are either cached food or carcasses when available. Finally, we speculate whether the observed geographical differences in arctic fox diets reflecting the local food availability may have repercussions for arctic fox breeding patterns. Below, we will discuss each finding in turn.\n\n4.1\nSeasonal changes in arctic fox diet\nIn addition to arctic foxes, only few other terrestrial vertebrate species remain in the high arctic year-round. In Northeast Greenland these include muskoxen, Northern collared lemmings, arctic hares, stoat and rock ptarmigans (Schmidt et al., 2012, 2018). When winter comes to an end, migratory birds such as small passerines (mainly snow buntings), multiple species of waders and waterfowl start arriving at their breeding grounds at Zackenberg. After the breeding season, most migratory birds start migrating south in late summer (August). These marked, temporal changes in the prey base of the resident arctic foxes were clearly reflected in their diet, and we found large dietary changes from late winter and into the autumn.\nIn late winter (April) arctic fox diet at Zackenberg mainly consisted of resident prey, in particular muskox (carcasses), but lemmings, ptarmigans and hares were also consumed. Remains of these prey species are also often found on arctic fox dens in the area in spring. Interestingly, migratory waterfowl and waders constituted a substantial proportion of the diet in late winter; a time of year before most birds have start arriving at their high arctic breeding grounds. Hence, in addition to early-arriving migratory birds, arctic foxes at Zackenberg may rely on prey depots of birds and\/or eggs cached the year before. Caching-behaviour by arctic foxes is well-documented in other arctic regions, allowing them to feed on migratory birds even in winter (Fay and Stephenson, 1989) or to rely on cached eggs when collared lemmings are scarce (Samelius et al., 2007).\nWhen the snow starts to melt, lemmings moving from their protected sub-nivean winter habitat to their summer habitat may be easy prey for predators (Schmidt et al., 2002). This is supported by our observation that lemmings formed an increasing part of the diet from late winter until the snow had disappeared. Hereafter their importance declined, likely as a consequence of predation-induced declining abundances as observed previously at Zackenberg (Schmidt et al., 2008) and Karupelv (Gilg, 2002). In part, this likely also reflected the arrival of migratory prey taxa, and in particular waterfowl. After snow melt, such birds became the dominant prey base for arctic foxes at Zackenberg and remained so until their southbound migration in autumn. While actual predation on waterfowl is rarely observed at Zackenberg, Meltofte (2006) reported that predation pressure on for instance goslings appears to be high, testifying to the importance of waterfowl as arctic fox prey.\nThe lack of waders in arctic fox diets in June and July was surprising, given that arctic fox predation appears to be the main cause of wader breeding failure at Zackenberg (Reneerkens et al., 2016). The perceived low importance of waders at Zackenberg may perhaps be attributable to the consumption of eggs in particular. Early in the incubation period, the egg will contain only limited amounts of DNA, as it contains only few cells and thus few nuclei. As a result, the proportion of eggs in the foxes\u2019 diet may be underestimated by DNA-based techniques. The higher contribution of waders to arctic fox diet in other months may then stem from consumption of young (especially in august before they fledge) and adult waders, rich in DNA. Nonetheless, breeding densities of waders in high arctic Greenland are low compared to other arctic sites in for instance arctic Alaska, Canada, and Siberia, which may contribute to the observed low importance of waders for arctic foxes at Zackenberg. At Zackenberg, arctic foxes thus appear important for wader breeding success, whereas waders on their part seem to contribute only little to fox diets.\nTowards the end of the snow-free season (September), many taxa still contributed to arctic fox diet, including waders, waterfowl and muskox. Some, predominantly juvenile, migratory birds are still found in the area in early September, but usually only the snow buntings stay in the area until October. Waterfowl and waders found in scats in September and October therefore likely stem from prey cached earlier in the season. Interestingly, fish constituted substantial parts of diets early and late in the season. Zackenberg is located close to the coast, and arctic foxes are often observed foraging along the coast in the ice-free season. In late winter, however, ice still covers the fjords, and fish in the diet at that time likely stem from cached fish. Alternatively, fish in arctic fox diet in late winter may reflect consumption of stomach content from seal carcasses left behind by polar bears on the sea ice. However, as no seal (Phoca sp.) DNA was recovered from the arctic fox scats, this seems unlikely. Additionally, the Zackenberg river holds many arctic char (Schmidt et al., 2008), constituting a food source for arctic foxes there. We also found other vertebrate predators (long-tailed skua, gulls; Table 2) in the scats of arctic foxes. While we do not know whether these were actually preyed or scavenged upon, we do know that intra-guild predation occurs (Gilg et al., 2006), and that at Zackenberg, arctic foxes prey heavily on long-tailed skua nests and young (Schmidt et al., 2008).\n\n\n4.2\nRegional variation in arctic fox diet\nThe large plasticity in arctic fox diet observed at Zackenberg over the course of the season was also reflected in diets of arctic foxes between the three sites examined. Hence, waterfowl dominated at Hochstetter Forland, lemmings at Karupelv, while arctic foxes at Zackenberg had broader diets consisting mainly of waterfowl and lemmings. However, both the number of dens, and thus arctic fox families, and the number of scats examined from Zackenberg was higher than for Hochstetter Forland and Karupelv, which may have contributed to the broader dietary niche observed. Similarly, air drying of scat samples at Hochstetter Forland and Karupelv may have resulted in lower prey recovery as compared to Zackenberg, where samples were either stored frozen or in ethanol until processing.\nThe splitting of samples into lemming high versus lemming low years also allowed us to assess the importance of the abundance of lemming prey at the three sites. As expected, the response to lemming density was most pronounced at Karupelv, where the lemming population fluctuates the most and where the availability of alternative prey is low. When lemmings were scarce there, arctic foxes mainly switched to small passerines. At Hochstetter Forland, the lemming fluctuations are less pronounced and at the same time pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus; both breeding birds and moulting flocks) constitute a large, rather stable alternative prey base for the arctic foxes in summer. Compared to Karupelv, fox diet at Hochstetter Forland included a smaller fraction of lemmings, but the dietary response of arctic fox to fluctuations in lemming densities were still similar: in lemming low years, less lemmings and more waterfowl were consumed than in lemming high years (ca. 3-fold difference in lemming reads between high and low years; Table S2). Nonetheless, the dietary composition was not significantly different between lemming high and lemming low years, possibly attributable to the limited number of scat samples from lemming high years. At Zackenberg, where the diet of the arctic fox was broadest, a shift towards more small passerines being consumed in lemming low years was the most pronounced dietary change in the significant dietary response to changes in lemming density. The substantial consumption of muskox during high lemming abundance at Zackenberg likely reflects a high availability of muskox carcasses (Schmidt et al., 2015) in the particular year included as the lemming high year, and the significant change in arctic fox dietary composition found between lemming high and low years should thus be taken with some caution. Still, these site-specific dietary responses to changes in lemming abundance stress that, when available, lemmings are important components of arctic fox diets in high arctic Greenland. However, they also show that the strength of the trophic link between arctic foxes and lemmings differs between sites.\n\n\n4.3\nLemmings, alternative food sources and arctic fox breeding\nThe observed site-specific dietary compositions and responses to lemming density, combined with the site-specific availability and stability of alternative food source, point to marked geographical differences in the importance of lemmings as food source for arctic foxes. We are tempted to speculate that these differences may explain the marked differences in arctic fox breeding patterns previously observed for two of the sites (Schmidt et al., 2012). At Karupelv where lemmings constitute the main prey base for arctic foxes, the production of fox cubs is closely linked to lemming density, and thus highly variable between years (Gilg et al., 2006; Schmidt et al., 2012). At Zackenberg on the other hand, arctic foxes have broader diets and are less dependent on lemmings. As a likely result, cub production at Zackenberg is not so tightly linked to lemming density as at Karupelv (Schmidt et al., 2012). Also, the density of breeding foxes is generally higher and more stable at Zackenberg as compared to Karupelv (Schmidt et al., 2012). Our knowledge about the arctic fox population at Hochstetter Forland is more limited, but our surveys this far suggest that breeding densities there are low but cub production rather stable and high (O. Gilg, unpubl. data). The latter is likely due to the easy access to waterfowl in summer, as also observed under similar prey conditions in other parts of the Arctic (Giroux et al., 2012; Pokrovsky et al., 2015).\nWhile the differences in arctic fox cub production appear linked to availabilities of both lemming and non-lemming prey during the snow-free season at the three sites, the differences in arctic fox breeding densities are likely to be found in site-specific differences in the availability of winter food. As observed in this study, arctic foxes may rely on muskox carcasses for their overwinter survival, supplemented with cached prey. The three sites examined here differ markedly with respect to availability of muskox carcasses and thus of winter food. This may be an important parameter determining the overwinter survival of resident adult arctic foxes (Gilg et al., 2009), and thus a major determinant of the geographical differences in arctic fox breeding densities. The situation in Northeast Greenland appears to be somewhat different from the situation in Svalbard, where it is the predictable access to migratory geese in summer and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) carcasses in winter that determines arctic fox abundance and population dynamics (Eide et al., 2012). Given the generally high density of muskoxen at Zackenberg, new muskox carcasses appear in the valley every year (Schmidt et al., 2015). Here, muskox carcasses may constitute a relatively stable, albeit not necessarily spatially predictable, food source in winter. Judging from the differences in breeding densities of arctic foxes among the three sites examined here, such carcasses may also provide a better resource than cached waterfowl or lemmings for winter survival.\n\n\n\n5\nMethodological considerations\nWhile faecal DNA approaches have been identified as an underutilised tool for carnivore diet analysis (Monterroso et al., 2019), the current study is, to our knowledge, the first one to apply molecular tools to directly quantify the diet of the arctic fox (but see Dudenhoeffer et al., 2021). Here, a few methodological caveats may be in place. It is well established that every method used for analysing scats comes with biases (Gosselin et al., 2017; Klare et al., 2011), and the molecular approach is no exception (e.g. Alberdi et al., 2019). Scat analyses are explicitly aimed at reconstructing the original diet contents after the carnivore has done its best to digest the prey. This results in uncertainties intrinsic to the process of reverse inference from what is left of food items passing through a complex digestive system. Though our approach resolves a wealth of dietary items from fox scats collected in high arctic Greenland, the dietary fractions presented are still associated with substantial uncertainties. Thus, while we were able to identify prey taxa in substantial detail using existing reference libraries, any inference regarding their relative importance in the diet of arctic foxes hinges on a link between the sequence reads in the scat and the quantitative composition of the original diet. Though normalized read numbers have been shown to provide good proxies of actual consumption (Deagle et al., 2019), the correlation is of course less than perfect. Hence, while we are confident that we have mapped out the various prey taxa adequately, their actual dietary contributions may be biased. Studies specifically examining the link between arctic fox consumption (and in particular eggs) and DNA reads recovered from scats are needed, and so are studies comparing various methods to estimate arctic fox diets, thereby uncovering the potential biases attached to each methodology. As the next step, we suggest well-controlled feeding trials using arctic fox individuals bred at fur farms or zoological gardens, and analyses of resulting scats subject to different environmental conditions. Such additional data may refine our quantification of links between diet consumed and scat contents observed. At the same time, we stress that they are unlikely to upset the ecological inference here reported. Our conclusions are built on relative differences, not absolute values, and we see no reason why comparisons between e.g. regions or years of different lemming densities should be biased.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThough lemming prey constituted an important component of arctic fox diets in high arctic Greenland, their dietary compositions also reflected the dynamic changes in prey availability from late winter to autumn. Across sites, local variation in availability of lemmings and alternative prey resulted in geographical differences in arctic fox diets, and to different dietary responses to changes in lemming density depending on the availability of alternative prey. With the environmental changes already observed in the Arctic (Box et al., 2019), the living conditions faced by arctic animals are changing. Extreme climatic events may add to this variation, by impacting the entire ecosystem simultaneously (Schmidt et al., 2019). However, the outcome of environmental change hinges on the structure of the trophic system (Schmidt et al., 2017). Our findings suggest that the availability of both key prey (lemming) and alternative prey in summer interact with the availability of winter food (cached or carcasses) to determine not only current patterns in arctic fox breeding but also how arctic fox populations will respond to altered environmental conditions.\n\n\nData statement\nData will be made available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.\n\n","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nPermafrost is an integral part of the cold-region eco-climate system, connecting various components and phenomena, such as the surface and subsurface hydrology, vegetation, micro-topographical changes, and sedimentation and nutrient outwash through fluvial and riverine channels (AMAP 2011, 2017). For example, permafrost is also known to store a large quantity of carbon in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. With climate change, permafrost degradation would lead to severe consequences in various parts of the terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric domains.\nDirect observations of subsurface thermal regime are required to determine the presence of permafrost; however, this is difficult in both time and space especially in remote regions. An indirect assessment of permafrost zonation could aid in estimating the probable extent of permafrost and providing an understanding of its variability. Different studies have proposed different methodologies where some studies is based on temperature-derived indices (e.g., the freezing and thawing indices from Harris (1981, 1982) and Saito et al. (2016); frost numbers from Nelson and Outcult (1987)) while others use modeled relationships with surface information, such as the elevation, micro topography, and soil types (Gruber 2012; Obu et al., 2019). Large-scale climate model outputs have also been investigated for direct (i.e., the calculation of the ground temperature: Koven et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2020) and indirect (i.e., estimations from the air temperature: Saito et al., 2009) measurements, depending on the required spatial resolutions and\/or temporal coverage. In this study, we modified an indirect assessment method using climatic indices proposed by Saito et al. (2016) and evaluated it against an observation-based dataset taken from the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost for climatic assessments.\nModeling the evolution of frozen ground (i.e., permafrost and seasonally frozen ground) for recent relevant climatic periods (e.g., since the Last Interglacial [LIG]) is an integral component for understanding the present-day conditions of the topo-eco-climate system in cold-regions, as well as to project future changes with smaller uncertainties (Osterkamp and Gosink 1991; Velichko and Nechaev, 2005; French 2007). However, there is limited understanding regarding the evolution of frozen ground, except for limited areas and periods. Geomorphological and stratigraphical investigations have revealed the occurrences and extent of periglacial (freeze-thaw) activities in different areas, such as North America (Froese et al., 2008, French and Miller 2014), western Europe (Bertran et al., 2014; Andrieux et al., 2016), and eastern Eurasia (Velichko and Nechaev 1992; Vandenberghe et al., 2019), most of which are relatively recent. However, variations from the Cenozoic to late Pleistocene periods have also been reported (Velichko 1984; Velichko and Nechaev 2005; Huijzer and Vandenberghe 1998). In recent decades, investigations of speleothem growth have revealed the possible favorable conditions for permafrost persistence during previous cold periods after Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (ca. 400 ka) or earlier in Eurasia and North America (e.g., Harmon et al., 1977; Lauriol et al., 1997; Dreybrodt 1999; Vaks et al., 2013; Wilcox et al., 2019; Batchelor et al., 2019, Biller-Celander et al. 2021). Some studies have also attempted to integrate local and regional information with the mapping of continental-scale frozen ground distribution based on field observations of the evidence of the last glaciation (Frenzel et al., 1992; Vandenberghe et al., 2014; Lindgren et al., 2016). Numerical climate models have also been used as direct (Saito et al., 2013b) or indirect methods (Saito et al. 2014, 2016; Liu and Jiang 2018) to obtain snapshots of specific periods in the late Quaternary. Willeit and Ganopolski (2015) reported on the interglacial-glacial evolution based on area and volumes of permafrost via transient simulations. On one hand, field-based reconstruction is advantageous because it provides direct evidence, but it is less conducive for spatial extrapolation. On the other hand, Numerical simulations can provide physically consistent mapping, but the validation of the results requires additional elaboration. The preparation and integration of detailed numerical models (in terms of the mechanism, as well as the spatiotemporal resolution) require data and expertise. In this paper, we attempted to assess the climatic changes and sensitivity of areas underlain by different frozen ground types (i.e., permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, and no freezing ground) by applying an improved classification method to interglacial-glacial environments since the Last Interglacial period (Kukla et al., 2002; Cronin et al., 2019). As a first step, we constructed 122 kyr time series of circum-Arctic climate maps from the Greenland ice core data, present-day reanalysis climate data, and a glacial isostatic adjustment model. We limited our target domain to the region north of 50\n\n\u00b0\n\nN based on the following factors: 1) it is one of the common borders for Arctic terrestrial environment research, 2) the climate in this domain largely correlate to those recorded in the Greenland ice cores; hence enabling the applicability of temperature changes provided from the cores, and 3) the application of products of this study (i.e., changes in permafrost distribution) to calculate the evolution of soil organic carbon and ground ice, which are mostly confined to the areas of interest (Saito et al. 2020a, 2020b).\nSection 2 provides a reexamination of the permafrost classification methods and validation under the present-day climate. Section 3 discusses the preparation and the application of these methods to data from the last 122 kyr. Section 4 examines the climatic sensitivity of permafrost zonation to climate variabilities. Finally, section 5 provides a summary and conclusion.\n\n\n2\nClassification of frozen ground zonation\n\n2.1\nMethods and data\nIn 2009, we introduced a climatological model to classify frozen ground zonation (e.g., permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, no frozen ground) using only the freezing and thawing indices of surface air temperature applied to large-scale climate model outputs (Saito et al., 2009). Subsequently, we improved the methodology incrementally for application to smaller-scale different regions and products (Saito et al. 2013a, 2014, 2016, 2020b). The methodology is mainly targeted at paleoenvironmental applications, where, in many cases, the available probable information is limited to temperature (either in absolute values or relative to a reference period, e.g., the present day). Nevertheless, the distribution of frozen ground also depends on other factors, such as snow cover, surface vegetation, soil wetness, soil characteristics, and micro- and landscape topography (Harris 1981, 1982; Nelson and Outcult 1987; Shur and Jorgenson 2007; Gruber 2012; Saito et al., 2013b; Obu et al., 2019). Despite its simplicity, the classification methodology produced reasonable results for northeastern Asia (Saito et al., 2014), South America (Saito et al., 2016), and Beringia (unpublished), as compared to observation-based paleo-environmental evidence. However, its applicability was limited under mountainous and\/or arid conditions and in areas with thin or negligible vegetation or snow cover (Andrieux et al., 2016; Vandenberghe et al., 2019, Pascal Bertran, personal communication).\nWe reevaluated the methodology to achieve further improvement using the following additional datasets. First, a new set of global observational measurements and attributional data (i.e., latitude, longitude, elevation) were acquired from the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P; http:\/\/gtnpdatabase.org\/) for different types of frozen ground (i.e., continuous, discontinuous, sporadic, isolated patches, and mountain permafrost; no permafrost, and unknown). The geographical location and type of permafrost are plotted in Fig. 1\n for the analyzed 1274 sites. Second, climate data for temperature were taken from ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach et al., 2020) covering the period 1979\u20132016\u00a0at 0.25\u00b0 grid points. Lastly, daily snow water equivalent (SWE) at 1\u00b0 grid points in the Northern Hemisphere for the period 1981\u20132010 was obtained from the Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE) data, which comprise satellite observations and reanalysis data (Mudryk et al., 2015; Snauffer et al., 2016; Mudryk and Derksen 2017).\n\nFig. 2\n shows the results of the classifications constructed based on GTN-P data. The borders between adjacent frozen ground types comprise two lines, as defined in previous studies (e.g., Saito et al., 2016). One intersects the permafrost areas into two sections; one section indicates that permafrost can be formed and aggregated under the given climate conditions, while the other implies that permafrost can be maintained under favorable environmental conditions, such as above-ground vegetation canopy, thick insulation layers by floor biomass, and necromass (including dead moss layers and peats), north-facing slope (in case of the Northern Hemisphere), and fine and wet sediments. The former is termed as climate-driven (CP) permafrost, roughly corresponding to continuous permafrost in the IPA glossary (van Everdingen, 2005), and the while other the latter as is environmentally conditioned (EP) permafrost, roughly corresponding to discontinuous, including sporadic and isolated, patches. Although the climate (temperature) is the primary factor in either case, it is implied that permafrost aggradation is likely occurs in large areas in the former zones while permafrost can be sustained in some areas by the favorable environmental conditions in the latter. (cf. concept of \u201cecosystem-driven\u201d and \u201cclimate-driven, ecosystem-protected\u201d by Shur and Jorgenson 2007). The other line divides the permafrost and seasonally frozen ground (Sf).\nIn this study, we constructed the new classification (hereafter, S21) in two steps (Fig. 2a). First, we used a multinomial logistic regression analysis based on the odds for categories of \u2018continuous permafrost\u2019, \u2018discontinuous permafrost\u2019 and another category aggregating other permafrost types (i.e., \u2018sporadic\u2019, \u2018isolated patches\u2019, and \u2018mountain permafrost\u2019) against \u201cno permafrost,\u201d employing the \u2018mlogit\u2019 package in the R (https:\/\/cran.r-project.org). The computed probabilities from the logit model are denoted by thin solid contours, while the areas of classified categories (i.e., the category that provides the highest probability of the four) are illustrated by hatches of the corresponding colors (e.g., blue for CP, white for EP, and orange for \u201cno permafrost\u201d). The lines are objectively drawn alongside the trough between CP and EP (thick blue line; S21 for CP\/EP), and that between EP and \u201cno permafrost\u201d (thick red line; pre-S21 for EP\/\u201cno permafrost\u201d). We further examined the physical competence of the results, to adjust the permafrost\/no-permafrost boundary (thick green solid lines; S21 for EP\/\u201cno permafrost\u201d). The details of the process are given in Section 2.2. The resulting new classification examined in this study can be expressed as follows:\n\n(1a)\n\n\nBorder\u00a0between\u00a0CP\u00a0and\u00a0EP:\n\n\nI\nt\n\n=\n0.6\n\n\nI\nf\n\n\u2212\n450\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1b)\n\n\nBorder\u00a0between\u00a0permafrost\u00a0and\u00a0Sf\u00a0\n\n\nI\nt\n\n=\n1.05\n\n\nI\nf\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nI\nt\n\n\n and \n\n\nI\nf\n\n\n respectively denote the thawing and freezing indices (in \n\n\u00b0C\n\n\u22c5\nd\na\ny\n\n), which are defined as the cumulative temperature days above and below the freezing temperature (\n\n0\n\n\u00b0C\n\n), respectively.\nThe conventional classification (shown by dashed lines in Fig. 2, hereafter S16) can be expressed as follows:\n\n(2a)\n\n\nBorder\u00a0between\u00a0CP\u00a0and\u00a0EP:\n\n\nI\nt\n\n=\n0.91\n\nI\nf\n\n\u2212\n2300\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2b)\n\n\nBorder\u00a0between\u00a0permafrost\u00a0and\u00a0Sf\u00a0\n\n\nI\nt\n\n=\n2.4\n\n\nI\nf\n\n\u2212\n3300\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of intermittently frozen ground, Im (\n\n0\n<\n\nI\nf\n\n<\n30\n\n)\u2014ground that freezes for a short duration (i.e., less than 2 weeks)\u2014and \u2018no freezing\u2019 ground, Nf (\n\n\nI\nf\n\n=\n0\n\n), which follow the formulation by Saito et al. (2014), are common for both methods.\nThe above statistical model for the frozen ground zonation is only applicable to exposed land; hence, neither subsea (or submarine, Nicolsky et al., 2012; Overduin et al., 2019) nor subglacial (Sugden 1977; Waller et al., 2012) frozen ground were considered for the construction. Therefore, only areas underlain by frozen ground on exposed land could be produced at each time slice (cf. Dobi\u0144ski 2020). However, to assess the zonation at different periods over the last 122 kyr (see section 3.1), we conducted a posteriori analysis using a series of snapshots to diagnose the zonation for subsea and subglacial permafrost at each time step. Section 3.3 presents and discusses the method and results.\n\n\n2.2\nEvaluation for present-day frozen ground zonation\nThe zonation of frozen ground in the Northern Hemisphere determined using different methodologies are compared in Fig. 3\n. Two independent maps of permafrost are used for reference. One is a map of 1\u00b0 resolution incorporated by Brown et al. (1998) under the auspices of IPA, hereafter referred to as the IPA map (Fig. 3a). This map was produced through cartographic interpolation and geomorphological inferences from observational evidence available at the time of compilation, categorized by areal permafrost occupancy: continuous (90\u2013100%), discontinuous (50\u201390%), sporadic (10\u201350%), and isolated (0\u201310%). The IPA map has been a de facto standard. The other map was derived by Obu et al. (2019), hereafter referred to as the Obu19 map (Fig. 3b). The map was produced using the TTOP approach (Smith and Riseborough 1996, 2002) conditioned by climate variables from various sources (e.g., reanalysis and satellite-derived data), and provided in terms of mean annual ground temperature (i.e., temperature at the top of permafrost; TTOP) and permafrost probability. In this study, we re-categorized permafrost zones of the Obu19 map by converting permafrost probability into the IPA zonation of horizontal occupancy.\nThe results of the two classification models are shown for S16 (Fig. 3c) and S21 (Fig. 3d), respectively. Because the category levels are different among the methodologies, a coloring scheme was provided for easy visualization of the corresponding categories qualitatively. Note that isolated patches are shown in greenish color (i.e., same as that for seasonally frozen ground) because most of the area experiences a nonfreezing period (or cases) by definition. Fig. 3e illustrates a physical adjustment process in constructing the S21 model, following the statistical procedure by the multinomial logistic regression. The frozen ground zonation classified by the pre-adjusted border line between permafrost and no permafrost zones (pre-S21; shown in red solid line in Fig. 2a. The gradient was 1.20) diagnosed the southern boundary of permafrost in west Siberia (ca. 60 to 90\n\n\u00b0\n\nE, 55\u201358\n\n\u00b0\n\nN) too southerly from the IPA map, while continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones were sufficiently well-classified. We examined the different values for the gradient of Eq. (1b) to find the gradient of 1.05 produces the border most consistent with the IPA map, while virtually unchanging those in other regions.\nThe S21 results showed improvement over S16 in delineating continuous permafrost areas for the border with EP in Siberia (from 60\u00b0 E to 120\u00b0 E), and arguably the Canadian Shield area. The difference in the borders between areas predominantly underlain by permafrost and areas of seasonal frozen ground (although it may still contain sporadic permafrost or patches) was subtle, but significantly improved for S21 relative to S16 in mountainous permafrost areas, such as the Scandinavian highlands from 8 (S16) to 206 (S21), as compared to 261 (IPA) and 305 (Obu19) [103\u00a0km2]; the European Alps from 0 (S16) to 12 (S21), as compared to 79 (IPA) and 67 (Obu19) [103\u00a0km2]; a part of the Tibetan Plateau from 1.93 (S16) to 2.48 (S21), as compared to 2.06 (IPA) and 4.60 (Obu19) [106\u00a0km2]; and the Rocky Mountains from 28 (S16) to 127 (S21), as compared to 308 (IPA) and 407 (Obu19) [103\u00a0km2].\n\nTable 1\n summarizes the areas of permafrost zonation for continuous and other types of permafrost for the entire Northern Hemisphere, and for two latitude bands: 20\u00b0N\u201350\u00b0N, and north of 50\u00b0N. The overall permafrost zone to the north of 50\u00b0N ranged from 16.9 (Obu19) to 20.0 (S21) in 106\u00a0km2, largely comparable to each other among the methods with varying relative distribution between continuous and the other types. As for the subtropical band, the variations are greater from 2.6 (S16) to 6.6 (Obu19) in 106\u00a0km2, with a wider difference in relative occupancy between continuous and other types than in the high latitudes. The large discrepancy is partly due to difficulties in determining the altitudinal permafrost type or zonation in the mid latitudes, as discussed below.\n\nTable 2\n shows a comparison of permafrost types for the individual 1274 sites in the GTN-P dataset diagnosed using different methodologies. For the map products (i.e., IPA and Obu19 maps), the value was taken from the grid point that included the examined GTN-P site. In all permafrost types, except for mountain permafrost, the map products largely showed reasonable correspondences between the same type of permafrost (e.g., continuous permafrost of the GTN-P sites to that in the IPA map). Nevertheless, the results of IPA tended to be more discrete than those of Obu19, which showed higher distinction for sporadic and isolated permafrost sites. In relative comparison to these map products, the S21 method showed reasonable skills for distinguishing the types of permafrost, proving high sensitivity to continuous permafrost, and no permafrost (\u201cNo Pf\u201d). Note that \u201cNo Pf\u201d, denoting no permafrost (but inherently including seasonally frozen ground \u201cSf\u201d), is different from no freezing \u201cNf\u201d, which principally excludes seasonally frozen ground. The classification of mountain permafrost remains challenging for all methodologies, partially because individual sites are specific and less generalizable, whereas observers tend to seek untypical cases found in the environment. Nevertheless, S21 showed a slight improvement in classifying EP at some sites.\n\n\n2.3\nImpact of snow in frozen ground classification\nSnow cover significantly affects the subsurface thermal regime (Harris 1981; Goodrich 1982; Krinner et al., 2018, Park et al., 2015). The concerned classification methodology was intentionally constructed without explicitly including snow in the formulation since paleoclimatic proxies do not usually provide information on past snow conditions. Nevertheless, evaluating the sensitivity of the improved classification methodology to snow cover is of significance. SWE at each GTN-P site was estimated via bi-linear interpolation of the 1\u00b0 CanSISE data. Fig. 4\n shows the results for the classifications stratified into three cases based on the long-term average of the maximum SWE of the snowpack: < 60\u00a0mm (thin; Fig. 4a), between 60 and 120\u00a0mm (medium; Fig. 4c), and >120\u00a0mm (thick; Fig. 4e). The effect of snow insulation, manifested as a deviation from the classification borders, was more apparent for thin to medium snowpack coverage (Fig. 4a and c), as compared to thick snowpack cases (Fig. 4e), which showed better results. This implies that the derived borders (S16 and S21) more likely represent the snow-insulated cases; thus, they are prone to yield larger deviations for mountainous or dry areas, as noted in section 2.1. Here, we attempted to examine the effect of snowpack in the classification. The effect of winter snow is often formulated by a multiplying factor, \n\n\nn\nf\n\n\n (with a value between 0 and 1) with the freezing index, i.e., \n\nI\n\n'\nf\n\n=\n\nn\nf\n\n\nI\nf\n\n\n (Nelson and Outcult 1987; Smith and Riseborough 1996, 2002; Gisn\u00e5s et al., 2016).\nAssuming that the density of the snowpack is 150\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123, which is within a typical range for mature high-latitude snowpack, the SWE values of 60 and 120\u00a0mm correspond to snow depths of 0.4 and 0.8\u00a0m, respectively. We assigned the typical values of snow depth in each category as 0.2\u00a0m (thin), 0.6\u00a0m (medium), and 1.0\u00a0m (thick), and computed the winter snow factor, \n\n\nn\nf\n\n\n, via the derivation provided in Gisn\u00e5s et al. (2016), which was obtained from observations of \u201chigh-latitude alpine\u201d snow (Liston 2004) collected at mountainous sites in Norway (Fig. 3 in Gisn\u00e5s et al., 2016). The calculated values of \n\n\nn\nf\n\n\n for thin, medium, and thick snow depth are 0.524, 0.337, and 0.250, respectively. The adjusted classification results improved classification (Fig. 4b and 4d; Table 2), demonstrating the possibility to classify permafrost zones more skillfully by accounting for the snow effect in shallow snowpack cases when the typical snow depth (or SWE) information is available.\n\n\n\n3\nApplication to paleo-permafrost under the glacial-interglacial environment\n\n3.1\nConstruction of paleo climatic and topographical data\nThe driving and boundary data used to reconstruct the changes in circum-Arctic temperature distribution have been described in our previous papers (Saito et al. 2020a, 2020b).\nThe temporal variation in temperature was based on SeaRISE (Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution; Bindshadler et al., 2013) project data, reconstructed from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) for the continuous period over the last 125 kyr to the present day (i.e., from the Last Interglacial to 1950). The Greenland ice core has been widely used as an indicator of global-scale climate variations, especially, the sequences and timings of Greenland stadial and interstadial periods (Lisiecki and Raymo 2005; Rasmussen et al., 2014; Lisiecki and Stern 2016). Changes in the climate in the target domain north of 50\n\n\u00b0\n\nN, as well as regions in the middle to low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, largely correlated with and corresponded to the records in the Greenland ice cores (e.g., regional evaluation for SW Ireland by Frankhauser et al., 2016; western Balkans by Sinopoli et al., 2019; southwestern Alaska by Wilcox et al., 2019).\nThe GRIP product has an advantage over more recent Greenland ice cores which are more fragmental. For example, the NGRIP (North Greenland Ice core Project; Kindler et al., 2014) ice core provides data only the period 123\u201310 ka (shown in gray in Fig. 5\na). The quality of temporal changes reconstructed from the GRIP ice core is arguable, especially for the period before 110-ka considering glacier tectonics (Alley et al., 1997) and surface melting (Kukla et al., 2002). In particular, the GRIP and NGRIP timeseries show apparent differences in the amplitude and timing of the changes during the abovementioned period. The resulting reconstructed permafrost maps using a snapshot value from the Last Interglacial will provide informative results in terms of the circum-Arctic extent of frozen ground in a warm world (Kukla et al., 2002; Cronin et al., 2019), because the warmest values are compatible between the GRIP and NGRIP (comparing the 115.4 and 119.2 ka values of SeaRISE and the 123 ka value of NGRIP in Fig. 5a) despite discrepancies in timings.\nThe topographic boundary data was based on the ICE-6G_C ice sheets data (Argus et al., 2014; Peltier et al., 2015) to derive the elevation, the ice sheets distribution and their thickness, and the coastal lines. The dataset spans from 122 ka to the present at the 1\u00b0 horizontal resolution. The past frozen ground zonation assessment was done primarily synchronous to the ICE-6G_C product (at a 500\u00a0yr interval from 0 to 21 ka, at a 1,000\u00a0yr interval to 32 ka, and a 2,000\u00a0yr interval to 122 ka.). Here we explain how we treated the three relevant ICE-6G_C variables in this study (Fig. 5b), i.e., topo, orog, and stgit, where stgit denotes the thickness of the ice sheet, orog denotes the height of the top of the terrestrial body (ice sheet or bedrock) above the concurrent sea level, and topo denotes the grounding line. This relationship is straightforward for an exposed land grid (left-hand side of Fig. 5b), but it requires special attention for a submerged bedrock. The right-hand side of Fig. 5b shows a schematic of the relationships in cases of submerged bedrocks with different ice sheet positions (from left to right, an ice sheet overlying a submerged bedrock, an ice sheet floating over a bedrock, and ice-free condition).\nThe freezing and thawing indices of location \n\n\nx\n\nE\nT\nO\nP\nO\n1\n\n\n\n at time \n\nt\n\n was determined by the following sets of equations.\n\n(3)\n\n\nM\nA\nS\nT\n\n(\n\nt\n,\n\n\nx\n\nE\nT\nO\nP\nO\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\nM\nS\nL\nT\n\n(\n\nt\n,\n\n\nx\n\nE\nT\nO\nP\nO\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n+\nL\n\nR\n\na\nt\nm\n\n\n\u2217\n\ne\nl\ne\nv\n\n(\n\nt\n,\n\n\nx\n\nE\nT\nO\nP\nO\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nT\n\na\nm\np\n\n\n\n(\n\nt\n,\n\n\nx\n\nE\nT\nO\nP\nO\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\nf\n\n(\n\nM\nA\nS\nT\n\n(\n\nt\n,\n\n\nx\n\nE\nT\nO\nP\nO\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\nl\no\nn\ng\ni\nt\nu\nd\ne\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nM\nA\nS\nT\n\n(\n\nt\n,\n\n\nx\n\nE\nT\nO\nP\nO\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\na\nm\np\n\n\n\n(\n\nt\n,\n\n\nx\n\nE\nT\nO\nP\nO\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n are surface air temperature and the annual amplitude.

Despite the unrealistically phase-locked geographical distribution to the present-day climatology, the produced maps showed reasonable correspondence in magnitude and overall continental features.\n\n\n3.2\nFrozen ground zonation maps in recent 122 kyr\nThe series of maps of the reconstructed frozen ground zonation and the terrestrial topography north of 50\u00b0N during the selected eras of interest (Fig. 6\n) for five typical periods in the recent 122 kyr: the mid-Holocene climate optimum (6 ka; Fig. 6a\u2013c), Younger Dryas Stadial (12.5 ka; Fig. 6d\u2013f), B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d Interstadial (13.5 ka; Fig. 6g\u2013i), Last Glacial Maximum (22 ka, LGM; Fig. 6j-l), and Last Interglacial (119.2 ka, LIG; Fig. 6m\u2013o). The years (shown in parentheses) were taken from the SeaRISE timeseries, and do not necessarily correlate to the general paleoclimatic events and chronology.\nOf the five eras displayed in Fig. 6, the mid-Holocene and LIG represent an interglacial period (i.e., warm world), while LGM represents a glacial period (i.e., cold world). The mid-Holocene climate was virtually similar to or slightly warmer than the present-day states, and the produced maps (Fig. 6b and c) were close to the present day in terms of permafrost distribution, but with a distinctive difference in the lower western part of both Eurasian and North American continents, which showed extensive areas of seasonally frozen ground not found in the present-day maps produced from the global reanalysis temperature map (Fig. 3c and d). This indicates an issue of regionality of the reconstructed (paleo)climate, a weakness of the single-sourced reconstruction of temperature distribution in the domain that it failed to incorporate the local and regional variabilities that are not in phase with the reference timeseries produced by the ice core.\nThe LGM period was the coldest among the simulated years. The S16 map shows an area underlain by discontinuous permafrost (EP) at the western edge of the Eurasian continent. In contrast, the S21 map showed that the entire exposed land, including western Europe, was underlain by continuous permafrost (CP), which is closer to the observation-based knowledge on regional scale (Bertran et al., 2014; Andrieux et al., 2016) and continental scale (Vandenberghe et al., 2014; Lindgren et al., 2016), suggesting an improvement regarding the abovementioned issue of regionality.\nFor an LIG example, the absolute year (119.2 ka) of SeaRISE is not necessarily synchronized with the chronology of ice sheet distribution of ICE-6G_C or other reconstructions, as stated in sections 3.1 and 3.2. Nevertheless, the high positive temperature anomaly shown at this time can provide the probable distribution of frozen ground under warm interglacial conditions. The produced map shows an expansion of no frozen areas in western Europe, where pollen analyses indicate a similar or even substantially cooler climate during LIG (Casper et al. 2002; Kukla et al., 2002). This possible discrepancy may also depend on the difference in seasonality between the current and last interglacial conditions. The seasonality calculation applied in this study (Saito et al., 2020b) was constructed based on present-day climatology. Changes in seasonality among different climate eras, as well as regionality, are issues that need further consideration and incorporation into the calculation of forcing data in future studies (Supplementary Fig. 1b, Cleator et al., 2020).\nThe Younger Dryas (cool) and the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d (warm) periods represent stadial-interstadial alterations in the thousand-year time scale. The corresponding maps show the intermediate states between the glacial (Fig. 6k-l) and interglacial (Fig. 6b and c) extremes, with a common tendency of S21 to produce larger areas of continuous permafrost (CP) and smaller areas of discontinuous permafrost (EP). It should be noted that the frozen ground classifications described in section 2.1 were constructed from the present-day states of frozen ground, loosely corresponding to a snapshot for the recent 30 years of observations, which is neither in equilibrium nor under abrupt transitions. Therefore, the diagnosed frozen ground types should not be interpreted as equilibrated under the examined thermal conditions at the time. Similarly, the frozen ground states realized in the course of history at the time were not in equilibrium in the strictest sense.\nIt is arguable that the thousand-year interval is not adequate for comparison and application of a statistical modeling without dynamic processes. Assuming a sinusoidal forcing at the surface with the time scale in the order of 103 years, the theoretical calculation of subsurface thermal conduction provides an e-folding attenuation depth of a couple to several meters with a typical range of soil thermal property, namely, soil thermal diffusivity of \n\n3\n\u223c\n10\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n7\n\n\n\n m2 s\u22122 (assuming averaged ranges of thermal conductivity of 1.0\u20132.0\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22121 K\u22121 for vegetative to mineral soils and heat capacity of 2.0\u20133.0\u00a0MJ\u00a0m\u22123 K\u22121 for dry and wet conditions). This implies that changes in the subsurface thermal regime in the upper several meters can catch up with atmospheric changes during the temporal interval of one thousand years between the two periods.\n\n\n3.3\nAreal extent of paleo-permafrost\nFor the examined period of the recent 122 kyr, the reconstructed temperature varied between \u221220.8\n\n\u00b0C\n\n (LGM) and 7.44\n\n\u00b0C\n\n (LIG), and consequently, the areal occupancy of permafrost largely varied. The series of the areal extent of frozen ground occupancies illustrates the temporal features of glacial-interglacial changes in the circum-Arctic frozen ground zonation since LIG (Fig. 7\n). Changes in the extent of the total exposed land (sum of areas from CP to Nf; from blue, to green, to orange shades) and glacial land ice bodies (LI, yellow shades) are shown in Fig. 7 for the entire 122 kyr (Fig. 7a and c) and, for details, after 26 ka (LGM to the post-glaciation period to the Holocene; Fig. 7b and d). In general, S21 showed a higher CP to EP ratio at any time than S16 as it was so designated. Overall range of variation was between 9.79 and 26.7 \n\n\u00d7\n\n106\u00a0km2 for S16 (Figs. 7a), 9.11 and 26.7 \n\n\u00d7\n\n106\u00a0km2 for S21 (Fig. 7c).\nDuring the glacial period (ca. 110\u201314 ka), exposed land was largely occupied by permafrost, of which CP gradually advanced and EP decreased until the LGM. Both models did not show any marked difference in long-term trends but slight increase of CP around 20 million km2. This is markedly contrasted to an apparent linear trend simulated by Willeit and Ganopolski (2015) increasing gradually from 12 million km2 (LIG) to some 20 million km2 (LGM) through the glacial period. This may result from the 3-dimensional, transient nature of the CLIMBER-2 simulation, insufficient construction of temperature in terms of regionality of this study's construction, or neglect of other climate variables such as snow.\nDuring the post-glaciation periods (15\u20139 ka), areal degradation of permafrost proceeded more rapidly than the expansion of exposed land facilitated by the retreat of large ice sheets (although partly canceled by the advancement of coastlines). During LIG, the areas of seasonal to no frost expanded, and the permafrost extent diminished despite the expansion of exposed land areas. In the SeaRISE timeseries, areas of no freezing (Nf) were identified only at the warmest period around 115 ka and 119 ka.\nStratigraphic observations and speleothem analyses provide evidence for regional or local presence and\/or absence of permafrost in the paleo-environment. Stratigraphic observations reported in Reyes et al. (2010) in northwestern North America showed the survival of pre-LIG ground ice permafrost at the study sites, indicating that deep permafrost remained not only under a cold climate (glaciation), but also under a warm climate (LIG), except for limited thaw of shallow permafrost, which is speculated to be widespread in the region [Ch'ijee Bluff in northern Yukon (Fig. 8\na), the Palisades on the Yukon River in Alaska (Fig. 8b), and Thistle Creek in west-central Yukon (Fig. 8c)]. The assessed series of permafrost zonation histories show a consistent result that the areas were underlain by CP during the glacial period (ca. 110 to 14 ka). These results agree with the previous understanding obtained from speleothem studies (Fig. 8d\u2013k). Speleothem growth can be attributed to various factors, such as the available liquid water, CO2 and calcite levels, and temperature above the freezing point. Therefore, the lack of a growth layer (or prevention of growth) is not exclusive, but rather indicative of permafrost (e.g., Harmon et al., 1977; Lauriol et al., 1997; Dreybrodt 1999; Vaks et al., 2013; Batchelor et al., 2019, Biller-Celander et al. 2021). Biller-Calender et al. (2021) reinvestigated speleothems in northwestern Canada (corresponding to Fig. 8d and i), reporting that permafrost was stable during the interglacial periods after 400 ka in the region (and likely Arctic-wide). Vaks et al. (2013, 2020) found no calcite deposition after MIS11 in central eastern Siberia (present-day zone of discontinuous permafrost; Fig. 8e), whereas growth was detected north of Lake Baikal (present-day zone of sporadic to isolated patches; Fig. 8g and j) in the interglacial period (i.e., LIG and the Holocene). This is similar to cases in southwestern Alaska (Fig. 8f; Wilcox et al., 2019) and the western slope of the Ural Mountains (Fig. 8h; Dublyansky et al., 2018), whereas deposits were synchronous to the Greenland interstadials in southwestern Ireland (Fig. 8k; Frankhauser et al., 2016).\nAlthough subsea (or submarine; Nicolsky et al., 2012; Overduin et al., 2019) and subglacial (Sugden 1977; Waller et al., 2012) permafrost occupies a non-negligible extent in the present-day permafrost distribution, it is sometimes unduly omitted from consideration (Dobi\u0144ski 2020). The classification examined in this study can only manage areas underlain by frozen ground on exposed land for each time slice. Nevertheless, we diagnosed possible zonation in the subsea and subglacial permafrost extent based on a posteriori analysis using a series of snapshots with the following criteria:\n\nA)\nIf a grid underlain by permafrost is submerged after the previous time step, it continues to be subsea permafrost until it re-emerges (i.e., no relaxation to thawing is considered).\n\n\nB)\nIf a grid is overlain by an ice sheet whose height is between certain threshold values, it is underlain by subglacial permafrost.\n\n\n\nIn this study, we set the lower and upper boundaries for subglacial permafrost to 1,500 and 3,000\u00a0m, respectively, after examining the results for the basal thermal state and ice thickness for the maximum Laurentide ice sheet, as reported in Sugden (1977; see his Fig. 3 for ice thickness and Fig. 4 for zones of basal thermal regime). Fig. 7e\u2013h and Table 3\n present the areal occupancy changes and summary of the areas including the subsea and subglacial permafrost, respectively, obtained from these analyses. Subglacial permafrost developed (up to 7.7 million km2) during the glacial period that declined during deglaciation to \u223c0.5 million km2 in the present. Subsea permafrost developed during the deglaciation period and amounts to 2.8 million km2 in the present-day case. However, it is impossible to identify the LIG and early glaciation subsea permafrost because the initial state at 122 ka was unknown.\n\n\n\n4\nSensitivity examinations\n\n4.1\nPermafrost areas to global mean annual temperature\n\nFig. 9\n summarizes changes in the areas of frozen ground as well as the exposed and ice-covered land, as a function of SeaRISE temperature anomalies (\n\nT\n\n) and the classification methods. Note that the exposed land (Fig. 9a), ice sheets (Fig. 9b), intermittently frozen ground (Im; Fig. 9i), and no freezing (Nf) areas (Fig. 9j) are not affected by the classification methods.\nThe following general tendencies were found for the total land areas and occupancies of frozen ground. The areas of exposed land increased with increasing temperature owing to the canceling effects of the retreat of land ice bodies\u2014consequent expansion of land areas (Fig. 9b), and coastline retreat by increased ocean water mass\u2014consequent shrinkage of land areas. CP areas decreased monotonically under a warming environment (Fig. 9c and d). EP increased with increasing temperature when it was colder than around \u22122\n\n\u00b0C\n\n, and then persisted or decreased (Fig. 9e and f). Seasonally frozen ground increased with a small gradient in the colder range (up to \u22123\n\n\u00b0C\n\n); it further increased in a warmer range (between \u22123\n\n\u00b0C\n\n and 7\n\n\u00b0C\n\n), followed by a decrease (Fig. 9g and h). If appeared north of 50\u00b0N when the temperature exceeded 2.2\n\n\u00b0C\n\n, and similarly, Nf likely appeared at above 5.4\n\n\u00b0C\n\n. For each of the frozen ground categories (CP\u2013Sf; Fig. 9c\u2013h), a bending point was found at approximately \u221210\n\n\u00b0C\n\n for CP and around \u22123\n\n\u00b0C\n\n for EP and Sf. These bends likely resulted from the following factors: 1) coastline retreat, and 2) northward advance of the boundaries between CP and EP, and permafrost and seasonally frozen ground, in addition to the confinement of the domain to the north of 50\u00b0N.\nThe abscissa of Fig. 9 (the temperature anomaly relative to the present-day value) is shown for the case in Greenland. A conversion to the global mean annual temperature (GMAT) was attempted in the following manner. The decadal trend of GMAT based on the Global Surface Temperature Anomalies data (Smith et al., 2008) provided by NOAA\/NCDC (https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/monitoring-references\/faq\/anomalies.php. Accessed on September 14, 2020) is 0.2216\n\n\u00b0C\n\n for the period 1990\u20132005, and 0.1586\n\n\u00b0C\n\n for the period 1990\u20132014. For the same periods, Reeves Eyre and Zeng (2017) showed that the respective counterparts of Greenland surface air temperature were 1.739\n\n\u00b0C\n\n and 0.696\n\n\u00b0C\n\n according to the MERRA2 (Molod et al., 2015) dataset, and 1.358\n\n\u00b0C\n\n and 0.559\n\n\u00b0C\n\n according to the MAR-ERA (Fettweis et al., 2017) dataset (Table 4\n in Reeves Eyre and Zeng, 2017), which showed the smallest mean absolute errors among 15 examined climate datasets (Table 3 in Reeves Eyre and Zeng, 2017). The resulting ratios of temperature amplitude in Greenland to that of the global value are 7.85 (=1.739\/0.2216) and 6.13 (=1.358\/0.2216) for 1990\u20132005, and 4.39 (=0.696\/0.1586) and 3.52 (=0.559\/0.1586) for 1990\u20132014. From a different perspective, the global temperature was estimated to be cooler during the LGM by 5.3\n\n\u00b0C\n\n (Cao et al., 2019) or 4.0\n\n\u00b0C\n\n (Annan and Hargreaves, 2013) on average. The SeaRISE temperature anomaly showed a cooling of \u221220.8\n\n\u00b0C\n\n\u00a0at the LGM, showing ratios of 3.93 (=20.8\/5.3) and 5.21 (=20.8\/4.0), respectively. Based on the range of these figures, we assume the overall ratio to be roughly four in this discussion. Thus, the previously discussed threshold values in terms of temperature variations in Greenland can be translated to GMT by dividing the values with 4.\nThe sensitivity of permafrost areas to temperature changes [\n\n\n10\n6\n\n\nk\n\nm\n2\n\n\n\n\u00b0C\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n] under conditions similar to the present-day climate condition was inferred from the linear fitting of scatter plots (Fig. 9c\u2013f). In terms of Greenland temperature, the inferred values were \u22121.04 (\n\n=\n\u2212\n1.04\n\u2212\n0.00\n\n) for S16 and -1.07 (\n\n=\n\u2212\n1.01\n\u2212\n0.06\n\n) for S21, which correspond to 4.2 and 4.3 \n\n\n10\n6\n\n\nk\n\nm\n2\n\n\n\n\u00b0C\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n, respectively, in terms of the global mean annual temperature. Although the conversion ratio was roughly estimated and different methods were used for calculating permafrost area, the results are comparable to recent estimates of 3.3\u20134.1 \n\n\n10\n6\n\nk\n\nm\n2\n\n\n\n\u00b0C\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n by Burke et al.

(2020) using numerical land surface simulations.\n\n\n4.2\nLatitudinal and longitudinal variability: regionality\nIn this study, the forcing temperature for all the 1-arc-minute grid points north of 50\u00b0N were derived from a single source of a Greenland ice core. In reality, latitudinal and longitudinal heterogeneities, or regionality, exist as a function of various factors such as insolation, general circulation, topographical configuration, and continentality, which affect both the spatial distribution of the averaged state (e.g., mean annual surface air temperature) and temporal variation (e.g., seasonal, inter-annual, decadal, centennial, millennial to glacial-interglacial variabilities). The mean annual temperature climatology derived from the ERA reanalysis data partly accounts for the regionality of the mean states. Seasonality was also included, to some extent, for the warm (interglacial) and cold (glacial) periods in the present-day reanalysis data and LGM simulation results from global climate models, respectively (detailed explanation in Saito et al., 2020b). Seasonality is a decisive factor for calculating thawing (\n\n\nI\nt\n\n\n) and freezing (\n\n\nI\nf\n\n\n) indices, which directly determine the type of frozen ground (Eqs. (1) and (2)). Compare present-day frozen ground maps generated on the basis of indices calculated from monthly reanalysis climatology (Fig. 3c and d), with those produced by the mean-seasonality calculations for geographical distribution (an interglacial example shown in Fig. 6b and c) and the present-day occupied areas shown at the right-most limit in Fig. 7. The comparison revealed that the map based on mean-seasonality calculations overestimated frozen ground in western Europe (west of 30\u00b0E), irrespective of the classification methods. This indicates that seasonality was overestimated for the region strongly affected by the Gulf Stream, which should be improved in the next step.\nIn terms of latitudinal variabilities, a latitudinal gradient of glacial\u2013interglacial amplitude of 2.5 \n\n\u00b0C\n\/\n10\n\u00b0\n\n was implemented to account for the polar amplification effect as mentioned in section 3.1, based on outputs from a number of global paleoclimate models (details provided in Saito et al., 2020b). We examined three different values of the gradient, namely 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 \n\n\u00b0C\n\/\n10\n\u00b0\n\n, under the LGM condition to investigate the sensitivity of the resulting frozen ground areas to the value of the gradient. The steeper gradient indicates that the long-term temperature amplitude is smaller at the 50\u00b0N latitude circle relative to that of the original SeaRISE timeseries. Table 4 summarizes the results for the two eras. For the mid-Holocene, with increasing gradient (i.e., smaller degree of warming in the lower latitudes), the areas of CP and EP increased and those of Sf and Im decreased (southern borders of permafrost shift southward), whereas the total areas of CP, EP, and Sf remained unchanged. It is noteworthy that no areas of Nf could be observed in either case. Thus, the reasonable range of the amplification effect will not solve the issue of overestimation of frozen ground in western Europe. As for the LGM case, Im and Nf showed no discernible differences, mostly because the climate condition was too cold for these categories. The areas of CP decreased with increasing latitudinal gradient, whereas those of EP and Sf increased with increased amplification. Although individual CP and EP showed sensitivity with slightly different values between the classification methods and gradient values, the total permafrost areas (CP\u00a0+\u00a0EP) at the LGM showed only very weak sensitivity due to confinement of the domain to the north of 50\u00b0N.\n\n\n\n5\nSummary and implications\nA previously developed classification for permafrost zonation using thawing and freezing indices was reexamined with a new set of present-day observations. The new classification model for permafrost zonation was validated against separate observation-derived datasets, including those used in previous studies, which showed improvement for the overall discrimination between continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, as well as permafrost at high altitudes. The models were then applied to circum-Arctic domains (north of 50\u00b0 N) at a 1-arc minute resolution for different eras over the last 122 kyr, ranging from the Last Interglacial to the present-day, to assess the climatic impacts and sensitivity of permafrost zonation under different climate conditions and settings. The produced maps of the paleoclimate and frozen ground were reasonably comparable to the previous understanding of the LGM period while they were qualitatively comparable to other eras with insufficient observational evidence for spatial comparison. The climatic assessment of the changes in permafrost zonation showed a variation range of 9.11 million km2 for interglacial and 26.7 million km2 for glacial periods; the maximum extent of subsea and subglacial permafrost was 7.7 and 0.5 million km2, respectively. The sensitivity of the meridional temperature gradient in the polar amplification showed smaller increases, i.e., by 0.2 million km2 [\n\n\u00b0C\n\/\n10\n\u00b0\n\n]\u22121, when the climate becomes warmer and decrease in permafrost zones by 4.3 million km2 for each 1\n\n\u00b0C\n\n increase in the global mean annual temperature.\nThe methodology tested in this study showed potential for climatology studies by providing a series of frozen ground maps at a large spatial scale for the geological past despite insufficient observational data covering the entire domain and numerical gridded models (such as Earth System Models, even with a reduced version) are too expensive. For example, one possible application is to use the product to determine the boundary conditions for a numerical model to compute the evolution of soil organic carbon and ground ice in the simulation domain (Saito et al., 2020b), which can produce contemporary maps that can be used to assess their amount and distribution (Saito et al., 2020a). Moreover, these data can be used to project additional greenhouse gas release due to the thawing of vulnerable permafrost (Yokohata et al., 2020). However, several issues must be further investigated or improved, including the expansion of the domain south of 50\u00b0 N, elaboration to account for the regionality of the forcing temperature data, and the consideration of snowpack and vegetation in the classification.\n\n","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nBaleen whales, like the Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) perform annual migrations between productive high latitudes in the summer to feed and warm lower latitudes in winter to breed (Bannster, 2018). These whales feed less during the breeding season, especially during the lactation period (Oftedal, 1993). The Antarctic minke whales exhibited the same migration patterns. They forage in the Antarctic Ocean during the summer (Tamura and Konishi, 2009), and move to lower latitudes to breed in the winter (Kasamatsu et al., 1995). Stomach content analyses revealed that Antarctic minke whales mainly feed on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in summer (Ichii and Kato, 1991; Kawamura, 1980), but they also consume Antarctic coastal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) (Tamura and Konishi, 2009). The diet composition of Antarctic minke whales differs according to the feeding location. For example, the percentage of stomach contents of Antarctic krill in whales in International Whaling Commission Management Areas III and IV of the Antarctic Ocean was more than 95%, while that in Area V was 85% (Fig. 1\n). In contrast, the occurrence of Antarctic coastal krill was greater in Area V (11.5%) than in Areas III and IV (0.1\u20132.7%) (Tamura and Konishi, 2009), possibly suggesting differences in prey abundance among the regions. During the winter period, Antarctic minke whales apparently cease to feed as the stomachs of whaling samples were generally empty (Williamson, 1975).\nDespite this typical migration pattern, multiple lines of evidences suggest that some Antarctic minke whales stay in the Antarctic Ocean during winter. Aguayo-Lobo (1994) encountered a number of Antarctic minke whales off the Antarctic Peninsula in the austral winter, and passive acoustic data have revealed their presence in these waters year-round (Dominello and \u0160irovi\u0107, 2016; Filun et al., 2020). This evidence indicates that some whales likely remain in the Antarctic Ocean all year.\nThe \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values in the baleen plates can be used to identify long-term changes in the environment and potential prey for whales. Oscillations in stable isotopic ratios are observed in the baleen plates as the plates grow (Best and Schell, 1996; Hobson et al., 2004). The \u03b4\n13C values can be used to identify latitudinal variations (Rau et al., 1982; Sackett et al., 1965) while \u03b4\n15N values are an indicator of trophic levels (Minagawa and Wada, 1984). The \u03b4\n13C values of particulate organic matter decrease at higher latitudes in Antarctic waters (Goericke and Fry, 1994). \u03b4\n15N values were used to estimate the dietary history of baleen whales. The \u03b4\n15N signature of baleen plates of southern hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangleae) showed that they mainly feed on Antarctic krill (Eisenmann et al., 2016). By comparing baleen plate isotopic signatures to those of their prey, Eisenmann et al. (2016) determined that some whales feed on Australian krill and fish.\nOscillations of \u03b4\n15N values in baleen plates also indicate the foraging ecology of baleen whales (Best and Schell, 1996; Schell et al., 1989). Hobson and Schell (1998) suggested that the values of \u03b4\n15N and not \u03b4\n13C in baleen plates fluctuate, possibly because either baleen whales moved annually, shifted their diet, or fasted seasonally. During the fasting period, the \u03b4\n15N values of animals increase, likely due to nitrogen excretion, while \u03b4\n13C values can either increase or decrease (Doi et al., 2017). Some studies also suggest that \u03b4\n15N enrichment in baleen plates can be a result of fasting (Hobson and Schell, 1998; Lee et al., 2005). Moreover, in blue whales (Balaenoptera masculus), oscillations of \u03b415N values in baleen plates reveal annual migration patterns (Busquets-Vass et al., 2017). If Antarctic minke whales cease to feed during the breeding season, as reported by Williamson (1975), \u03b4\n15N values of baleen plates would likely increase during this period, whereas if the whales overwinter and keep feeding at higher latitudes, \u03b4\n15N values would presumably remain constant.\nPreviously, the migration patterns and prey preferences of pregnant Antarctic minke whales have been studied using the isotope signatures of baleen plates. Uchida et al. (2021) showed that pregnant whales mostly feed on Antarctic krill in the Antarctic Ocean, which is consistent with the stomach contents identified in Antarctic minke whales (Ichii and Kato, 1991). Although they migrated to lower latitudes during the breeding season (Kasamatsu et al., 1995), they were unlikely to feed enough in these regions (Williamson, 1975); therefore, the \u03b4\n13C values remained relatively constant (Uchida et al., 2021). In contrast to females, the long-term foraging history of male Antarctic minke whales is unknown, and may differ among sampling locations. Understanding the foraging history of male Antarctic minke whales will help to determine the annual life cycle of this species.\nThus, the purpose of this study was to examine the foraging habits of male Antarctic minke whales using the stable isotope ratios in baleen plates. We hypothesized that the isotopic signatures of the baleen plates would differ between sampling locations. We also predicted that the isotopic signatures of males would remain constant when the males remained in the Southern Ocean. Lastly, we anticipated that the isotopic signature of baleen plates in males resembles that of females.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nStudy location and animals\nBaleen plates from nine mature male Antarctic minke whales were used. These whales were collected in Area V of the Antarctic Ocean from December 2015 to February 2016 (2015\/16) and in Areas III and IV from December 2016 to February 2017 (2016\/17) (Fig. 1) with the permission of the New Scientific Whale Research Program in the Antarctic Ocean (NEWREP-A). The study area is defined by the International Whaling Commission. The biometric data of these whales were collected by the Institute of Cetacean Research (Table 1\n), and their maturity was determined by histological examination of the testes. Males with seminiferous tubules over 100\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter and spermatids or open lumen in the tubules were considered sexually mature. Baleen plates of these whales were stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C until analysis.\n\n\n2.2\nSample preparation\nThe baleen plates were thawed at room temperature, the gum was removed from the plates, and they were washed with distilled water. We cut a 10\u00a0mm strip along the outer edge of the plate, which was further cut into a 5\u00a0mm wide segment. Each segment was numbered from the base and stored in a 5-mL vial. A 2:1 chloroform: methanol solution was added to the vials, and the samples were stored for 24\u00a0h to extract the lipids (Mitani et al., 2006; Uchida et al., 2021) for comparison of the isotopic values to those of females, reported by Uchida et al. (2021). Lipid-extracted samples were dried at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for more than 48\u00a0h (DKM600, Yamato Scientific Co., Ltd. Japan). Dried samples were pulverized using a Dremel grinder (Dremel Micro, Bosch Power Tools B.V., USA).\n\n\n2.3\nStable isotope analysis\nStable isotope analysis was used to measure the \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values of every second sample from the base. We weighed powdered samples (approximately 0.6\u00a0mg) in tin capsules (SA76981101, S\u00c4NTIS analytical AG, Teufen, Switzerland). An elemental analyzer (vario MICRO cube, Elementar Ltd., Langenselbold, Germany) coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IsoPrime100, IsoPrime Ltd., Stockport, UK) was used. Stable isotope analyses were conducted at the Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan. All results are expressed as delta (\u03b4) values per mill (\u2030) relative to the international standard, as follows:\n\n(1)\n\u03b4X\u00a0=\u00a0[(R\nsample\/R\nstandard)\u00a0\u2212\u00a01]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01000\n\nwhere X is either 13C or 15N, and R is the mass ratio of either 13C\/12C or 15N\/14N of the sample and international standards, respectively. These standards are Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB) calcium carbonate for 13C and atmospheric nitrogen for 15N. The standard deviations for \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N averaged 0.028\u2030 and 0.19\u2030, respectively.\n\n\n2.4\nStatistical analysis\nStable isotope ratios are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation in this study. To compare the stable isotopes of samples and potential diet of male Antarctic minke whales, \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N biplots using base \u03b4\n15N values and corresponding \u03b4\n13C values were created to compare isotope signatures of baleen plates and potential prey using stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR) (Parnell et al., 2010). We used three species found in the stomachs of Antarctic minke whales as the prey: Antarctic krill, Antarctic coastal krill, and Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum). The stable isotope ratios of these prey species were analyzed by the Japan Chemical Analysis Center (ordered by the Institute of Cetacean Research). Lipid extraction procedures were performed during these isotopic analyses of prey. Stable isotopes of fresh prey removed from the stomachs of 97 Antarctic minke whales collected during the same study periods were analyzed (Antarctic krill (n\u00a0=\u00a086 whales), coastal krill (n\u00a0=\u00a09 whales), and silver fish (n\u00a0=\u00a02 whales)), and the results are summarized in Table 2\n. In addition, we used stable isotope ratios of Australian krill spp. and pelagic fish spp., based on previous studies (Davenport and Bax, 2002; Eisenmann et al., 2016; Harris et al., 2014), since they are potential prey of Antarctic minke whales during the breeding season. These ratios are listed in Table 2. The trophic enrichment factors of \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values in baleen plates were set as 2.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\u2030 and 2.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u2030, respectively, from a previous study on fin whales (Borrell et al., 2012). These values were used to compare the isotopic signatures of female Antarctic minke whales to those of Uchida et al. (2021) who used these enrichment factors in their female study. Potential prey species and their contribution rates were estimated using a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model in the SIAR.\nOscillations of stable isotope signatures were determined following the main protocols of Uchida et al. (2021). Briefly, a distance of more than 50\u00a0mm between the two minimum values of \u03b4\n15N was considered as the annual growth extent since one cycle of \u03b4\n15N in females was at least 50\u00a0mm. The lowest values of the first and last periods of the baleen plates were not considered as minimum values of these oscillations, as isotope signatures could further decrease. When at least two or more values decreased, we considered the lowest point as the minimum value. A whale was considered to have overwintered in the Antarctic Ocean when only one minimum value of \u03b4\n15N was found (i.e., no oscillation). We determined the overwintering period as the distance between one \u03b4\n15N minimum value and the tip of a baleen plate using the annual growth rate. For \u03b4\n13C, we used a distance of more than 30\u00a0mm, as reported by Uchida et al. (2021). All statistical analyses were conducted in R 3.5.0 (R Core Team, 2019).\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nThe average \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values at the base of all plates were \u221224.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62\u2030 and 6.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.60\u2030, respectively (Fig. 2\n), and the averages across all the plates were \u221224.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.50\u2030 and 6.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u2030, respectively. The mean \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values for each plate are shown in Table 1. According to the output of the SIAR model, the contribution rates of prey were greatest for Antarctic krill in both 2015\/16 and 2016\/17, which was determined by the minimum and maximum \u03b4\n15N values. Using minimum values, 95% credible intervals of Antarctic krill in 2015\/16 were 15\u201393% (Fig. 3\na), while those in 2016\/17 were 57\u201396% (Fig. 3b). With maximum \u03b4\n15N values, the contribution rates of Antarctic krill were the highest among prey species in both study periods. The 95% credible intervals of Antarctic krill in 2015\/16 were 31\u201391% (Fig. 3c), while those in 2016\/17 were 50\u201388% (Fig. 3d). The 95% credible intervals of the contribution rates of Antarctic coastal krill were greater in 2015\/16 (0\u201346%, Fig. 3a) than in 2016\/17 (0\u201330%, Fig. 3b) using minimum \u03b4\n15N values. The maximum \u03b4\n15N values returned 95% credible intervals of Antarctic coastal krill of 0\u201342% and 0\u201338% in 2015\/16 and 2016\/17, respectively (Fig. 3c and d). Using minimum \u03b4\n15N values, the 95% credible intervals of the contribution rates of silver fish, Australian krill, and pelagic fish were 0\u201332%, 0\u201328%, and 0\u201322% in 2015\/16, respectively (Fig. 3a); however, the rates of all three prey species were low in 2016\/17 (Fig. 3b). The 95% credible intervals of Australian krill fish (0\u201316%) and pelagic fish (0\u20131%) were low in both study periods using maximum \u03b4\n15N values (Fig. 3c and d).\nPeriodic cycles were observed for both \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values (Fig. 4\n). The mean number of oscillations in \u03b4\n13C values was 1.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53, while that of \u03b4\n15N was 1.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71. The length of one cycle in \u03b4\n13C values ranged from 50 to 190\u00a0mm (101.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a043.9\u00a0mm), while that of \u03b4\n15N ranged from 60 to 100\u00a0mm (81.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.3\u00a0mm). One 10-mm baleen sample represented approximately 1.5 months based on the mean \u03b4\n15N oscillation of 81.3\u00a0mm. In whale AM246, no oscillations in \u03b4\n15N values (Fig. 4 for 15\/16AM246) were observed. The \u03b4\n15N values were minimally variable from the sample at 60\u00a0mm to the tip (180\u00a0mm in length). The amplitude between the maximum and minimum isotope ratios of all males was 1.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51\u2030 for \u03b4\n13C and 1.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u2030 for \u03b4\n15N. The amplitude in the whale AM246 was 0.69\u2030 for \u03b4\n13C and 0.86\u2030 for \u03b4\n15N. These two values were lower than those of the other whales.\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nIn this study, the SIAR model showed that the contribution rates of Antarctic krill were the highest among the prey species of male Antarctic minke whales. Antarctic krill are the most important prey of these whales in foraging grounds (Ichii and Kato, 1991; Kawamura, 1980), comprising 85% of stomach contents (Tamura and Konishi, 2009). In this study, the stomach contents of males were mainly Antarctic krill, corroborating the results of the SIAR model. Both the \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values of the baleen plates were within the range of isotopic signatures of Antarctic krill. In contrast, the contribution rates of Australian krill and pelagic fish were low, which was consistent using both minimum and maximum \u03b4\n15N values in both study years. In a previous study, the stomachs of Antarctic minke whales in breeding grounds were generally empty, and their blubber thickness decreased from winter to spring (Williamson, 1975). These results indicate that males rarely feed on Australian krill and pelagic fish in breeding grounds.\nContributions of Antarctic coastal krill were greater in Area V in 2015\/16 than in Areas III and IV in 2016\/17, which was found using minimum \u03b4\n15N values. Tamura and Konishi (2009) reported that Antarctic coastal krill in the stomach contents of Antarctic minke whales in Area V were greater than those in other areas. This may be related to the distribution of this prey species, which is found above continental shelves, where the water depth is less than 1000\u00a0m (Thomas and Green, 1988). The depth of the water around the Ross Sea in Area V is 1000\u00a0m or shallower (Tamura, 2010), and although the locations of whales caught in Area V were mainly outside of the Ross Sea, whales may have been foraging at higher latitudes where Antarctic coastal krill was available. In contrast, in Areas III and IV, whales were observed in areas greater than 1000\u00a0m in depth (Fig. 1), and this agrees with the horizontal distribution of Antarctic krill reported by Siegel and Watkins (2016). Thus, the contribution rates of Antarctic coastal krill were high in Area V in 2015\/16. Although our results showed that the main diet of Antarctic minke whales was Antarctic krill, a proportion of 40% of Antarctic coastal krill obtained from the model indicates that prey may be chosen based on their abundance in foraging areas.\nOscillations of \u03b4\n15N and \u03b4\n13C values were observed with most whales. Oscillations of \u03b4\n15N values within the range of isotopic signatures of Antarctic krill could indicate that these whales mainly feed on Antarctic krill. Although there is no evidence to support Antarctic minke whales fasting during the breeding season, those who moved to lower latitudes during the breeding season showed little or no stomach contents (Williamson, 1975). In addition, the blubber thickness of males gradually decreased from winter to spring (Williamson, 1975). During fasting periods, animals rely on internal recycling and reserves of N (Gannes et al., 1997), so \u03b4\n15N values increase. Moreover, the contribution rates of the prey species in the lower latitudes were very low. Thus, the increase in \u03b4\n15N values suggests a fasting period of male Antarctic minke whales. For \u03b4\n13C, Doi et al. (2017) demonstrated that \u03b4\n13C values during fasting periods had both a decrease and an increase in \u03b4\n13C values that oscillated for most of the whales. In southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) that feed north of or at the Subtropical Convergence, \u03b4\n13C values can increase more than \u221223\u2030 (Best and Schell, 1996), which we did not observe here. Furthermore, in southern right whales during fasting periods, their baleen plates only incorporated \u03b4\n13C values of high-latitude plankton (Best and Schell, 1996). The \u03b4\n13C values of males fell within the range of isotopic signatures of Antarctic krill, indicating that males did not predominately feed on other prey species.\n\n\u03b4\n15N values showed oscillations in males, except for the whale AM246. The \u03b4\n15N enrichment of baleen plates represents changes in diet or fasting period (Hobson et al., 1993). Since the minimum \u03b4\n15N values showed greater contributions of not only Antarctic krill, but also Antarctic coastal krill in Area V, these values likely represent whales spending time in the Southern Ocean. Moreover, because most males had \u03b4\n15N values that were high at the base, and a 10-mm baleen sample likely represents approximately 1.5 months of foraging record, these whales were likely present outside of foraging grounds during the time of isotopic incorporation into plates. This is supported by the results of previous studies. The number of Antarctic minke whales in breeding grounds peaks in September and decreases in December (Williamson, 1975), and the whales gradually move from 0\u00b0 S in October to 30\u00b0 S in December (Kasamatsu et al., 1995). This indicates that Antarctic minke whales are in northern waters in December; therefore, they were not in the range of Antarctic krill distribution, which is south of 60\u00b0 S (Siegel and Watkins, 2016). No oscillation in the \u03b4\n15N signature was observed in the whale AM246. The amplitudes of \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values of this whale were low compared to those of the other whales, which may indicate that AM246 overwintered and continued feeding on prey in the Antarctic Ocean. Based on the length of constant \u03b4\n15N values of the baleen plate (180\u00a0mm) and the annual growth rate (81.3\u00a0mm) of \u03b4\n15N values in our study, the whale may have remained in the foraging ground for at least 2.2 years.\nThe changes in \u03b4\n13C values of whales AM246 and AM075 show a similar trend, and these values were within the range of isotopic values of Antarctic krill. However, \u03b4\n13C values cannot be used as an indicator of fasting, since \u03b4\n13C values can either increase or decrease during fasting periods (Doi et al., 2017). Furthermore, vocalizations of Antarctic minke whales during the breeding season in Antarctic waters have been documented (Dominello and \u0160irovi\u0107, 2016; Filun et al., 2020). Since male baleen whales are more often vocal during the breeding season (Clapham, 1996; Croll et al., 2002), males could have been present and overwintering in the Antarctic Ocean.\nFinally, it was evident through the use of baleen plate \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values that male and female Antarctic minke whales have similar foraging habits and migration patterns. The main diet of female Antarctic minke whales was identified as Antarctic krill using stable isotope signatures (Uchida et al., 2021), and the amplitude of \u03b4\n13C values was similar between the male and female whales. The number of oscillations of \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values in males (0\u20132 cycles) was less than that of females (1\u20134 cycles) (Uchida et al., 2021). This is possibly because pregnant females are more inclined to migrate annually to breeding grounds at lower latitudes. Our results suggest multiple migration patterns of male Antarctic minke whales compared to female whales.\nIn summary, we have presented the foraging habits of male Antarctic minke whales using the \u03b4\n13C and \u03b4\n15N values of baleen plates. The diet of male minke whales was predominantly Antarctic krill, and isotopic signatures of prey species in Australian waters were rarely incorporated into the baleen plates. By comparing with the study of female Antarctic minke whales, both sexes of this species showed the same preference for diet. However, the foraging ecology of male Antarctic minke whales using stable isotope signatures indicates that one individual might have remained in the foraging ground year-round. Therefore, our study revealed that stable isotope signatures of baleen plates can be an important indicator of annual life history strategies, especially for male whales whose life history has not been clearly determined.\n\n\nFunding sources\nFinancial support to Mayuko Otsuki and Yoko Mitani was provided by the Institute of Cetacean Research.

These factors determine the ability of local communities to react positively or negatively to climate changes. Whether they benefit from, mitigate or suffer from these changes will vary depending on the adaptability of the populations.\nOne essential element of adaptation, adaptation planning, aims to reduce human vulnerability to the current and future negative impacts of climate change by designing policies, programs and plans for adaptation (da Cunha and Lioubimtseva, In press). However, it remains unclear how to address social and environmental inequity and to what extent the residents of urban and rural settlements have something to contribute and how their opinions could influence the adaptation measures adopted (Anguelovski et al., 2016; Lioubimtseva and da Cunha, In press; Thomas et al., 2019).\nAre vulnerable populations interested in climate change, have they identified its effects, and lastly, how willing are they to adapt? These issues are becoming increasingly significant in different geographical contexts and circumstances (Anguelovski et al., 2016; Baztan et al., 2020; Cameron, 2012; Huntington et al., 2019; Olazabal et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2019). Vulnerability assessment and response strategies to natural climate variability provide a good starting point for the study of adaptation needs (Smit et al., 1999; Smit and Wandel, 2006).\nClimate change exacerbates existing threats and risks and generates new ones in the lives of the Indigenous people of the Arctic regions. It exerts pressure on the environment as well as on social, economic and cultural dimensions. (AMAP, 2017; Doloisio and Vanderlinden, 2020; Huntington et al., 2019; Nuttall, 2018). Huntington et al. (2019) It has been established that \u201cmany studies still retain a central focus on climate even as they consider multiple factors that affect people; they can thus overlook or minimize the principal concerns, knowledge, politics, livelihoods, experiences, and priorities of people themselves as research agendas driven by outsiders focus on climate change rather than on the people themselves\u201d. It is important to consider climate change issues, but also the other issues it raises. It is important to identify stories of adaptability and resilience in the past and present (Cameron, 2012; Ford et al., 2015) and to highlight the adaptive capacities of the Arctic people for the future. These adaptive capacities are multi-factorial and will be influenced by political, economic or social dimensions that may be more or less deeply embedded (Ford et al., 2015).\nThe focus of this paper is on Tiksi (\u0422\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0438\n) and its interdependent hinterland, the Bulunsky District, taking into account its history and governance processes, as well as its heavy reliance on natural resources. It is located in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) which covers an area of over 3\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0km2. The Arctic zone represents about 52% of the territory of the republic (Doloisio and Vanderlinden, 2020).\nStarting from a predominantly autochthonous occupation of the territory, the planned economy during the Soviet period changed the socio-economic structures of the region. In 1932, the Soviet Union undertook the first northeastern passage without wintering: the Sibiryakov expedition was the first icebreaker to sail from Arkhangelsk to the Bering Strait. After the Second World War, the Northeast Passage allowed ships to navigate between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans while remaining out of the control of the United States. Although it concerned only a few dozen boats a year, it was considered to be strategic by the USSR so it built a dozen ports, accessible only two or three months per year, in sheltered bays and Arctic Ocean estuaries: Tiksi on the Lena, Nordvik on the Gulf of Khatanga, etc.(Van Grunderbeek, 2013).\nFounded in 1933, Tiksi is located in a border zone where special access rules apply. \u201cA sea frozen for ten months of the year and its endless tundra [..] Tiksi recounts its own piece of Soviet history\u201d (translated from (Vitkine, 2012)). This city was an important strategic military and scientific base endowed with an airport infrastructure essential for its accessibility. A wave of immigration from all over the USSR brought people attracted by work, high wages and\/or a romantic vision of the Far North which allowed Tiksi to reach its peak of 11\u00a0649 inhabitants in 1989 (1989 Soviet Census).\nThe collapse of the USSR and the rapid transition to a market economy led to the liberalization of societies and a significant reduction in freight flows. This, along with the long winters, has resulted in the suspension of the shipping line terminus to the west and a strong shift in migration from moderate immigration to the North in the 1980s to large scale emigration in the post-Soviet period (Milanovic, 1998). Moreover, the decline of the military base and the airport produced a sharp increase in unemployment. Since 1990, many families have left the Bulunsky District and moved to larger cities in Siberia (Laruelle, 2016; Prokhorova, 2013, p. 35\u201336). The population of Tiksi has fallen to 5063 inhabitants (2010 Russian Census), with more than half of its population leaving the district between 1990 and 2014. The populations of both are still decreasing.\nThe Russian government has implemented an active state policy for the Arctic over the past few years. There is an \u201cadjustment\u201d (or rather \u201creconfiguration\u201d) of the modern system of state regulation of the development of the Arctic zone. It aims to increase the economic development of the territories of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation and to improve the quality of life of the population of the Russian Arctic.\nIn 2020, a whole set of strategic documents stating the policy of Russia in the Arctic was adopted (Table 1\n), including the \u201cFundamentals of the state policy of the Russian Federation in the Arctic for the period up to 2035 and beyond\u201d and the \u201cStrategy for the development of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation and ensuring national security for the period up to 2035\u201d. The latter defines an implementation plan for the integrated social and economic development of the Arctic territories in terms of science and technology; information and telecommunication infrastructure; environmental protection; international cooperation; and defense and national border control (Kudryashova et al., 2019, Buchanan, 2020). Significant changes were also made in Russian legislation, including the introduction of various preferences and tax incentives. At the regional level, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) implemented a comprehensive socio-economic development program for the Arctic districts up to 2020 (Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation, 2014; Public Chamber of the Republic of Sakha, 2016).\nThe aim of these development programs is to narrow the development gap between the Arctic districts and the rest of the Republic, as they are currently constrained by a number of economic social, organizational and managerial problems (Borisov et al., 2015; Federation Council, 2019, 2020; Larchenko and Kolesnikov, 2017; Nikulkina, 2018; Nikulkina and Filimonova, 2019; Peshina and Zakharov, 2017; Selin, 2013; Tatarkina, 2014). At the same time, these policies seek to control access to this strategic territory. We can question, as underlined in Ford et al. (2015), the position of authorities with regard to climate change, as they tend to consider it as an opportunity to be dealt with through adaptation rather than a threat.\nThe purpose of this article is to understand if people living in Tiksi and its hinterland are aware of the impacts of climate change and global warming and if they consider these to be important, but also to identify other issues they face. We also aim to identify their actions and strategies for adaptation to climate change. The paper consists of five sections, including introduction, methods and data, findings on local issues and adaptation strategies, discussion, and conclusions.\n\n\n2\nMethods and data\nThis article presents the data from a field trip in November 2014, piloted by the ARTisticc project (Adaptation Research a Trans-disciplinary Transnational Community and Policy Centred Approach) and conducted jointly with a Russian research team from North-Eastern Federal University (NEFU) with a general understanding of the Bulunsky District case study and specific disciplinary knowledge of Northern Yakutia (anthropology, biology, physics etc.) and social scientists from the University of Versailles (UVSQ). This formed the basis for an exploratory case study of the town of Tiksi and its hinterland to study its strategies for adaptation to climate change. We conducted qualitative and quantitative surveys based on conceptual and interview frameworks established by the ARTisticc project while remaining open to new knowledge and hypotheses.\nThe purpose of the qualitative interview was to gather an understanding of environmental changes and adaptive capacities. Semi-structured interviews were designed from pre-identified themes which aimed to identify and describe adaptation initiatives to global challenges with a special focus on climate change, specifically, identification of changes in places and activities; measures\/actions implemented in order to cope with these changes; adaptation processes in the past and potential ones for the future. We contacted a sample of local stakeholders, representative of social diversity of Tiksi and its hinterland. Thus, 15 interviews of representatives from six stakeholder categories (federal authorities, state authorities, municipal authorities, Indigenous people, scientists and business) and one focus group (FG) produced a lot of dense qualitative data (see Appendix A).\nAnalysis was done based on grounded theory, a methodology for generating theories from field data using inductive reasoning. It aims to group the data into categories and then to deduce theories and extract meaning from a situation so that the various elements can be linked (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Paill\u00e9, 1994). The semi-structured interviews were transcribed and treated using the qualitative data analysis software, Atlas.ti. In this process, text quotes were classified according to a set of codes, defined from pre-identified themes and complemented using inductive reasoning as relevant elements arose from the transcripts themselves. The quotes cited in this article are anonymous and have been translated by a native Russian speaker from Russian to English, and then English proofread (Appendix B). There may be some inaccuracies due to the difficulties inherent to any translation, the different grammar rules and the individual ways of expressing oneself in a culture. Thus, they should not be considered as exact quotations.\nThe quantitative survey was conducted in the Bulunsky District with 122 respondents (Appendix C). The 16 multiple-choice questions aimed to study public opinion on climate change, its impact on everyday life and the practical implementation of measures against global warming (Appendix D). The survey also asked questions about their everyday concerns, their intention\/desire to move from Tiksi, the way they imagine the future, and some socio-demographic questions (Sukneva and Nikulkina, 2017).\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nThe changing climate, an issue among others\nThe future of Tiksi is of strategic importance due to its geographical location and the opening of the Northeast Passage due to climate change is regarded as an opportunity (L'\u00e9quipe, 2010; Martin, 2014; Thorez, 2008; Van Grunderbeek, 2013). In 2014, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that Russia would build or restore six military towns, with living and service conditions of a high standard, in their Arctic region, including Tiksi, to reinforce its role as a \u201cmaritime rescue subcenter\u201d (Bennett, 2014; Busch, 2017; Lalonde, 2017; Melino et al., 2020). There is also a plan to renovate the Tiksi airport infrastructure (The Moscow Times, 2014). It has been recently approved for medium-size aircrafts and air companies are now considering the establishment of regular flights to Moscow. As part of the federal Development Strategy for the Arctic Zone, the North Yakutia Support Zone will include reconstruction of the Tiksi seaport. In addition, new ships for river-sea shipping are to be built and a regional shipyard developed (Staalesen, 2017). Other projects for local power supply are emerging (Staalesen, 2018).\nIn fact, this comprehensive program for the socio-economic development of the Arctic was not fully financed by the federal and regional budgets. Therefore, the goals and objectives for the planned activities of the state program were not fully achieved and fulfilled. The real needs of the Arctic zone are not being fully met and the goals of sustainable socio-economic development and a reliable level of subsistence for the population are not being achieved (Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation, 2014; Federation Council, 2019, 2020; Nikulkina, 2018). Furthermore, Russia appears to be significantly behind in its plans for Tiksi, or is unable to send permanent equipment as other Arctic bases are of higher priority (Melino et al., 2020).\nTherefore, Tiksi is evolving in a highly uncertain context, with a mix of environmental pressures like climate change and economic, political and social uncertainties. Our surveys focus on climate change and its impacts on everyday life, but also investigate other challenges and concerns. During the quantitative survey, respondents were asked to select five answers from the options provided in response to the following question \u201cWhich everyday problems worry you most?\u201d (see occurrences of choices in Fig. 1\n). We extracted the most relevant mentions from the qualitative survey to confirm or mediate the results on this question about everyday problems. All quotes are presented in Appendix B.\nThe issues highlighted by the respondents are closely linked to circumpolar conditions and insularity and are mostly shared with other Arctic communities (Cameron, 2012; Council of Canadian Academies, 2014; Forbes and Stammler, 2009; Huntington et al., 2019). Climate change may exacerbate other problems, particularly the central issue of Tiksi's accessibility with other towns of the Sakha republic and its hinterland.\nThe most frequently highlighted problems are: High prices (14.3%); Alcoholism and heavy drinking (13.4%); Low wages and pensions (9.1%); Work by the public services (8.3%); Lack of attention by federal authorities to the problems of the northern territory (6.9%); Unemployment (6.7%). Similarly, during qualitative interviews, respondents mostly highlighted social problems: alcoholism, high prices, low salaries and unemployment (Quotes # 1 to 4). Participants also mention difficulties associated with climate conditions, mostly linked to living conditions, food and medicine supply and transportation. In connection with these concerns, people blame the state and federal authorities for not sufficiently taking responsibility for these issues (Quotes # 5, 6).\nChild neglect (3.1%) and Problems of school education (2.1%) were low on the scale of worries in the quantitative survey, but are of major concern in the qualitative survey for education stakeholders who were also preoccupied with the lack of sunlight and vitamins as well as teenage suicides (Quotes # 7, 8). These worries should be analyzed against another interesting category from the quantitative survey: a state of anomie and deterioration of relationships between people (6%), which featured as a backdrop in many interviews.\nEnvironmental pollution (6.7%) is also emphasized as a concern in qualitative interviews but is considered to be of secondary importance, as solving environmental problems will not improve people's lives as much as sorting out social concerns. People highlight seawater pollution and pollution caused by forest fires as these affect fish quality and the migration paths of reindeer (Quotes # 9, 10).\n\nRespondents also highlight the need for compensation for mining pollution (Quote # 11). Climate warming in the Arctic is expected to increase the accessibility of mineral deposits, creating more favorable conditions for industrial mining. Exploitation of coal and alluvial diamond deposits and oil and gas exploration in the continental shelf of the Laptev Sea has already started in the region.\nHowever, these activities can exert additional pressure on traditional livelihoods and the well-being of local communities (Behrends and Schareika, 2010; Yakovleva, 2014). Ford et al. (2010) points out that industry representatives are consulted in relation to the impacts of climate change on mining but community members are not. Moreover, it is very possible that Indigenous peoples will not benefit from the activities of large-scale extraction projects. These industries create jobs in the mines but these positions are rarely given to Indigenous people, mainly due to a lack of skills, training or standardized education (Quote # 12). Likewise, Nadasdy (1999, p4) notes that scientists emphasize the traditional dimensions of Indigenous knowledge and disregard the possibility that aboriginal people might have distinct cultural perspectives on modern industrial activities such as logging or mining.\nFinally, another concern is pollution. Participants suggested some actions to reduce it (Quotes # 13, 14). For instance, boats should be banned from throwing fuel into the rivers and sea. Regulation and depollution actions are necessary and the waste recycling plant should be re-opened.\nThe problem of \u201cClimate change\u201d only receives 1.9% of mentions in the quantitative survey. Although 84.7% of the respondents say they feel changes in climate (question 4), these changes seem not to be judged as important. Some respondents do not detect any changes (Quote # 15). Others observe changes in terms of fauna (wild reindeer), and flora (mushroom, berries, bushes, type of flowers), in particular, an earlier maturation of berries. Not surprisingly, climate change is deemed a matter of concern for the local population when it affects their lives negatively on a daily basis. The tenability of the airport as well as the opening of roads in winter is of primary importance for Tiksi as a reduced transport service hinders delivery of medicines, foods, fuel and other essential goods and reduces contact with the outside world (Quotes # 16).\nRespondents also identify an increasing risk of flooding in Nayba (\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0431\u0430), in Kyusyur (\u041a\u044e\u0441\u044e\u0440) (Quotes # 17), as well as rapid coastal erosion (Quote # 18), issues that raise the question of shutting down or transferring settlements. Moreover, thawing permafrost is leading to flooding and a loss of pastures (Quote # 19). Coastal erosion, due to permafrost thaw, poses a particular problem for Bykovskyi, nibbling at its old cemetery. On the other hand, coastal erosion and permafrost thaw facilitates the finding of ivory fossils collected from defrosting mammoths (Quote # 20).\nAnother manifestation of climate change is an increase in unpredictability. For local populations, natural phenomena have become more difficult to predict as indicators are modified by climate change. For instance, the timing of the arrival of fish is changing due to the temperature of the water. Movements of the shoals of fish also change but the inhabitants cannot understand why (Quote # 21). Another predictability issue is linked to weather phenomena (polar night, blizzard, frost, etc.). Participants explain that it is becoming more difficult to know what weather is coming and find that variability, even within a day, is higher. The reindeer breeders depend on predictability and become disoriented as a consequence of changes in climate (Quote # 22). These changes lead to an increase in the number of accidents, especially related to late freezing-over, frazil, early floods and low snow cover (Alexander et al., 2011).\nRespondents are pessimistic about these issues and about the ability of funding and programs to resolve them. They complain about the lack of funding and planning, and remote decision-making. They also highlight that they have almost reached a critical population threshold and have lost economic activities (market gardening, waste treatment plant, metal processing operations) that strike at adaptive capabilities.\n\n\n3.2\nLocal adaptive strategies in Tiksi and its hinterland\nEnvironmental changes and other issues generally push Arctic people to adapt and innovate using their knowledge and resources (Huntington et al., 2019; Pearce et al., 2015). The capacity of the people to adapt to these changes is embedded in their everyday habits. For example, Evenki, Yakuts, Yamal-Nenets, Khanty, and other reindeer herders in Siberia use mobile technologies and thus have new ways of being mobile. They have added ethno-tourism, sales of traditional arts and crafts and other activities to their usual livelihoods (Stammler, 2013).\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the process of adaptation can take three different forms: 1. Autonomous adaptation (adaptation in response to climate and climatic effects experienced, without explicit planning or a conscious focus on addressing climate change), 2. Incremental adaptation (adaptation actions where the central aim is to maintain the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale), and 3. Transformational adaptation (adaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a system in response to climate and its effects) (IPCC, 2014). In the Arctic zone, adaptation is often associated with 1) changes in daily life and\/or 2) the need for investments or funding to tackle the various impacts of climate change on northern lives and livelihoods.\nDespite the pessimism, there is some local adaptive capacity and there is potential for action, more so within rural settlements than in urban Tiksi. We display below five types of adaptive strategies, also classified according to the above definitions in Table 2\n.\nOne important form of local adaptation planning is a mandatory flood prevention plan that is produced every year (Quote # 23). In Nayba, they are working on a plan for the evacuation of people in the case of flooding, relocating them to Tiksi or elsewhere on the Lena River (Quote # 24). The universal fear of losing their home and land caused people to resist moving. Due to the changing climate, environments are being fundamentally altered or disrupted and to an increasing extent, this is challenging individuals' attachment to place (Doloisio and Vanderlinden, 2020; Quinn et al., 2015).\nIn addition, people are developing diverse adaptation strategies to cope with coastal and bank erosion. A member of the State Natural Reserve \u201cUst-Lensky\u201d (Quote # 25) and the Head of the Bulunsky region have become aware of coastline erosion and have requested scientific data on this topic to help to implement strategies to stabilize the banks. In Kyusyur, authorities plan to abandon a school that is currently affected by the erosion processes and build a new one (Quote # 26).\nTransportation is a big concern for the Tiksi hinterland. Climate change influences decision-making on the opening of roads in winter, and some respondents in rural settlements have become afraid to use them because of previous accidents (Quote # 27). The official opening of winter roads is being adjusted every year (beginning later and closing earlier) and some never open (Quote # 28). Transportation of school groups on winter roads is forbidden since 2011, with consequences for school transportation and cultural events that have not yet been resolved (Quote # 29). Traditional activities have also had to adapt their methods of transportation due to climate change. Fishermen have begun using snowshoes and skis which allow them to walk on thin ice for ice fishing. Hunters have begun practicing for the trips on the rivers before they freeze up in winter so that they can arrive in their hunting areas on time.\nTransportation has also deteriorated with the closure of the military base, as the military unit used to help with the delivery of synthetic vitamins to schools by helicopter. Nevertheless, this lack of access to the vitamins has led to local adaptation measures such as farming by schools in Siktyakh (\u0421\u0438\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0445) and Kyusyur, harvesting of berries, and mushrooms in Naiba and Siktyakh schools. The schools themselves prepare berries, mushrooms, and vegetables in summertime in order to compensate for the lack of vitamins in winter (Quote # 30). In Siktyakh, greenhouse domestic farming is in a development phase.\nIf we focus on the adaptive capacity of the Indigenous people, access to natural resources is closely related to the security of working conditions that their traditional knowledge offers them (Doloisio and Vanderlinden, 2020). The ongoing climate changes are transforming real life: the migration of reindeer is delayed in winter; reindeer breeders struggle with disease management when the summers are too hot (Quote # 31), and the thaw of permafrost is leading to flooding and loss of pasture area. Herds are slowly being moved from lowlands to mountainous areas (Quote # 17). Indigenous peoples are increasingly finding themselves in situations where their practices, experience and knowledge can no longer help them. As a result, the economic conditions for the production of the traditional crafts of the Indigenous peoples are deteriorating and adaptations strategies are appearing.\nReindeer breeders\u2019 ways of working and their experiences are a mix of ancestral know-how on reindeer herd management and more modern practices from recent history since the Soviet period. Nowadays, they manage to maintain their livelihood and avoid big losses by reintegrating the knowledge and experience of older herders. For instance, reindeer-herding brigades that include herders-teachers with many years of working experience produce better results. Under conditions of thick crust, they choose migration routes near the river banks on slopes where it is easier to access the lichen (Alexander et al., 2011) and they use snowmobiles ahead of the herd in order to break up the solid top crust. During hotter summers, the herds are led to mountainous areas. In addition, they seek outside help, such as asking for more accurate weather forecasts as they depend on predictability (Quote # 22) and scientific research on the wild reindeer population (Quote # 32).\nIn parallel, reindeer herders make economic adaptations by developing multi-activity income and there is a clear demand to increase subsidies for reindeer herders (Quote # 33). Higher subsidies would allow them to live better, in more modern living conditions, and thus attract young people. These combined factors are driving a trend toward more a more sedentary lifestyle and a loss of cultural traditions (Quote # 34).\n\nAnother concern for reindeer herders is controlling wolf predators, which represent a direct threat to reindeer. Local administrations allocate funds to organize wolf hunts but this is not enough (Quote # 35). An efficient solution needs to be found to cope with the problem of wolf attacks on reindeer herds. Respondents consider that wolf hunting, by its nature, is too difficult without external federal help, which previously took the form of hunting from helicopters (Quote # 36). Herders feel that the possibilities for action by them are limited and, in discussion they express the need to invest in controlling the population of wolves to maintain the integrity of their system. On the other hand, one respondent highlights another more local adaptive action: wolves are necessary to cull the weakest animals in the herds. Consequently, it is better to regulate the wolf packs from the inside instead of killing entire packs so that the fragile tundra ecosystem is respected (Quote # 37).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussions\nIt is essential to pay particular attention to the historical processes and the adaptive capacity of the Bulunsky district in order to cope with climatic, political, social and economic changes. The current mode of governance is still influenced by the Soviet planning of the past, causing people to expect decision-making at the federal level. Regarding measures against global warming (question 9), 37.6% of the respondents to the quantitative survey affirm that solutions should come from the federal government, 16.9% from regional authorities and 14.6% from local authorities. Only 7.3% of the respondents expect that actions will come from inhabitants themselves. Even when there is potential for local autonomous adaptive measures, based on change in daily live, the reflex of most of the Arctic population is to turn to the federal government for funding and planning (Ford et al., 2015).\nThis link with the federal government is not passive however and clearly formulated requests to ensure the future of the district and its activities are submitted to it by local authorities and others administration members. Although the hinterland looks better positioned to propose local adaptation strategies, Tiksi plays the role of administrative center and is more proactive in its relationship with the federal government than other settlements in the Bulunsky District. Local authorities develop and propose changes in the current legislation, in the regulations or new incentive policies at the republic and federal levels.\nTheir expectations focus on public programs and policies to protect and develop the district. For example, respondents refer to federal level development policies as investment incentives which aim to attract companies and encourage local entrepreneurship. Also, the Bulunsky district makes requests to include Nayba's coastal erosion issues in federal and regional programs. Respondents highlight the role that local administrations can play in ensuring the effective implementation of these policies and programs.\nMoreover, legislative changes to help Tiksi and the Bulunsky District to enhance the quality of life of their inhabitants were suggested in the qualitative survey: change of the district status to mountain-taiga zone; use of the index of climate severity as a way of financing northern regions; and a change of status for reindeer herders (transition from subsidized activities to public servants). These changes can only be made at the federal level and require an allocated budget.\nThis reliance on the federal level can be analyzed from two different perspectives. The first is linked to the funding of programs for local initiatives and legislative changes, as well as subsidies for economic activities. Local decision-makers estimate that funding must come from the regional and federal levels as the district does not have sufficient financial resources.\nThe second perspective refers to the special place of Tiksi and its hinterland in Russia. Tiksi is the only urban settlement in the Bulunsky district and has become a focal point in the life of the area. Different Indigenous groups have traditionally occupied the Russian Arctic territory leading to a current multi-ethnicity (Doloisio and Vanderlinden, 2020). In Tiksi, residents are mainly Russians and Ukrainians, while in rural settlements, Indigenous people are predominant: Evenks, Yakuts and Evens (Federal State Statistic Service, 2014).\nSovietization has brought about a deep reorganization and transformation of Indigenous economies (Takakura, 2012): reindeer herders have gone from a plurality of activities to specialization (reindeer meat for export during the emergence of the sovkhozs) and a policy of immobilization led Indigenous people to move from small mobile villages to wooden houses in settlements. Nowadays, Indigenous people are returning to diversification (the community's subsistence shifted from reindeer herding to reindeer hunting), as they have more needs than before (permanent housing, television, computers, and clothing) that are difficult to meet with the low income from breeding alone.\nThis plurality of activities encourages Indigenous people to come to Tiksi for employment which adds to its attractiveness as the administrative center of the Bulunsky district (Statistical yearbook of Yakoutia, 2018): the rural population comes here to access banking facilities, to deal with administrative requests, and to receive health care. Tiksi acts as a Russian relay for this isolated territory, leading Tiksi and its hinterland to be interdependent. Indigenous people need Tiksi for their everyday life endeavors, and the existence of Tiksi is partly justified by the maintenance of minimal activities in the Bulunsky district, made necessary by its strategic geographical location.\nThus, some problems need to be managed at the federal level as they require strategic federal interest and large amounts of funding. The role of Tiksi in strategic decisions linked to the northern sea route of Tiksi cannot be decided at the local level (e.g. reopening the military base, rehabilitation of the port, renovation of roads, improvement of the communication network). This situation effectively places local decision-makers in a situation of strong dependence on federal decision-making. Local authorities make requests to federal authorities but respondents in the 2014 survey doubt that the federal government is concerned about the Bulunsky district.\nThe abovementioned statements date from 2014. They allow us to compare the demands with recent development strategies and Federal Law. In 2008, the \u2018Foundations of State Policy of the Russian Federation for the Arctic up to 2020 and Beyond\u2019 was published and the region has been established as an independent object of state policy (Kudryashova et al., 2019). A system of strategic planning documents for social and economic development of the Arctic region and national security protection has been established. Budgetary regulation of the development of the Arctic territories of Russia is carried out through the implementation of state programs. Nowadays, there are more than 20 publicly declared and published federal state programs, highlighting the Arctic zone as a special development territory (Portal of State Programs of the Russian Federation, 2021).\nIt should be noted that strategic planning documents are not legal acts. These are documents in the sphere of development of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation, but there is no single legislative act regulating the activities in the Arctic Zone. As example, the Federal Law\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0On state support of entrepreneurial activity in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0create favorable conditions for entrepreneurial activity in the Arctic Zone and the Federal Law \u201cOn Amendments to Part Two of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation in connection with the adoption of the Federal Law\u201d provide tax preferences to entrepreneurs in the Arctic to stimulate economic activities.\nPredictably, specific legislation changes for district or reindeer herders status are not an issue of strategic documents. The above strategies and Federal Laws could have been a response to the respondents demand for investment incentives. Unfortunately, the continuing shortage of financial resources in the Bulunsky district can be explained by uneven distribution, with almost all investments going to regions with significant volumes of hydrocarbon production and major projects for the development of new oil and gas fields. The purpose of most of the tax incentives is also to create favorable conditions for hydrocarbon production activities (Nikulkina, 2018).\nAnother significant problem with state programs that hinders the development of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation is insufficient funding of programs, despite the significant growth of the planned indicators of allocated funds. The progress report on the implementation of the program at the end of 2016 shows that 84% of the planned funds were allocated in 2014, 94% in 2015, and 93% in 2016 (Public Chamber of the Republic of Sakha, 2016). In 2019, the largest number of defaults in absolute values are in extra-budgetary funds and the federal budget, while regional budgets allocated more than 36% more funds than originally planned (Table 3\n). The Accounts Chamber of Russia explained the decrease in the cash execution indicators of some programs by the lack of a comprehensive approach in their formation. It is noted that the planning of specific activities for the development of the Arctic and their financial support seems inconsistent in the absence of an established system of strategic planning documents (Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation, 2020).\nThus, the Arctic regions are not equally stimulated and suffer insufficient financial support as well as unevenness and instability in this financial support. The goals of socio-economic development of the Arctic Zone and support for the stability of life in the Arctic are not achieved. This inequality in the distribution of investment support is not only a problem in itself, but it generates uneven development of the Arctic regions, which, in turn, raises doubts about the effectiveness of the development programs.\nConsequently, the current development conditions of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation require new, adequate and timely fiscal mechanisms for the implementation of state policy. At the regional level, the formation of a new financial institution, the Regional Arctic Fund, is proposed for the development of the Arctic territories of Russia to provide financial support to stimulate investment activities and to support the development of traditional economies (Nikulkina, 2018). The establishment of regional funds for the development of the Arctic territories of Russian regions will foster horizontal inter-budgetary relationships in the macro region. Also, it will permit the formation of a system of targeted ongoing financing of regional \u201cArctic\u201d projects: infrastructure investment projects; projects for the development of the production sector; energy and communal infrastructural development; air travel; projects aimed at improving quality of life in the Arctic regions, including projects addressing the use of natural resources in the Arctic territories.\nTo return to the need for adaptation to climate change, adaptation is not specifically referred to as a target in these strategic planning documents. Environmental issues are mostly linked to reduction of pollution. Nevertheless, the multiplicity of plans indicates an awareness of the need to act and it responds to local stakeholders\u2019 requests to maintain the essence and integrity of the socio-economic system (without explicit planning for climate change). In this way, they contribute to adaptation and these development-oriented policies represent a concrete formal space where different aspects of adaptation can be introduced and addressed.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nEven if vulnerable populations are the first to suffer from the effects of climate change, especially since they live in places extremely sensitive to change, we realize that climate issues have little importance for them. This observation is not unique to Arctic areas but is also true for developing countries and for vulnerable populations in economically strong areas (Anguelovski et al., 2016; Baztan et al., 2020; Filho et al., 2019; Smucker et al., 2015; Thomas and Twyman, 2005).\nLike much of the Arctic region, Tiksi is not a traditional urban settlement as it is of strategic interest for the Russian government. It is particularly vulnerable to climate change and the socio-ecosystem is barely viable as life there is difficult. The future of Tiksi's local population depends on the will of decision-makers in the federal government and climate changes issues are not a high priority for them. People struggle with many issues and uncertainty about the future does not stimulate them to project themselves into the future. What future is possible, desirable and desired?\nThe interdependence between Tiksi, the regional center, and its hinterland, coupled with important uncertainties about the future lead to a sense of inadaptability. Uncertainty about the future has not been explicitly expressed (no occurrences) but this is an underlying factor in almost all interviews. The population of Tiksi lives in a chaotic world under constant social, economic and environmental stress caused by the decline in economic activity, emigration of the youth to attend university (mainly in Yakutsk), the decline in traditional crafts which are unattractive to young people, strong dependence on the federal government for subsistence and environmental transformations due to climate change.\nHow can you find the strength to adapt when you depend on subsidies and federal strategic programs? How can adaptation capabilities be maintained and developed when all of the qualified young people leave? Even if the people of the Bulunsky district keep their adaptive capacities developed by their tradition of living in extreme environments, uncertainty about the future and dependence on the regional and federal authorities call into question the ability of the Bulunsky district to manage adaptation planning in the long term and to implement large-scale projects.\nClimate change needs to be given priority and adaptation actions need to be integral to mainstream political policies (Casado-Asensio et al., 2016; Khailani and Perera, 2013; Smit and Wandel, 2006). How can public policies respond to the demands of the Bulunsky district and its social challenges, while implementing measures to adapt to climate change? In these conditions, how can their autonomous adaptive capacities be improved?\nAdaptation is not specifically addressed within official development documents as conceived in Western countries\/science, but it still represents a concrete concept where multiple key elements (directly and indirectly associated with adaptation) such as development, quality of life of northern inhabitants, conservation of traditional lifestyles, among others, are addressed. More efforts are still required to create new communication channels and spaces between different authorities and stakeholders in order to guarantee that formal policies fit the local urgent necessities. Within this context, it is possible to affirm that they can undoubtedly be useful policy tools that can promote the dialogue between the different stakeholders at federal, regional and local scales in order to find solutions to the main climate and environmental challenges that local residents from settlements like Tiksi or Bykovsky are currently facing.\nCertain policies such as protection against floods or erosion are in response to societal issues and are adaptation measures, but other actions leaning towards empowerment of these populations could be better financed. Making people aware of the climate issue can only be done by considering the other challenges they face with a view to reducing their overall vulnerabilities (Huntington et al., 2019). In terms of adaptation, the socio-economic development programs should integrate the adaptation actions put in place and support and improve them. The need for higher levels of support for the local reindeer herders, hunters and fishermen is consistently highlighted in interviews and would sustain the Indigenous people who are vulnerable in the Bulunsky district and so improve the relationship between the government and the Indigenous people. It would also reinforce the role of Tiksi as a regional service center, and so help to keep the territory under control.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by (a) the ARTisticc project (Adaptation Research a Trans-disciplinary Transnational Community and Policy Centred Approach) funded by the Belmont Forum International Opportunities Fund [Coastal 2012 call], with contributions from Agence Nationale de la Recherche, France; National Science Foundation, USA; Ministry of Earth Science, India; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Russia; and Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Canada and (b) the Nunataryuk project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [grant agreement no. 773421].\n\n","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAssessing the mechanisms behind the Arctic amplification and the nature of forcings and feedbacks is fundamental due to their impact on global climate system (Yamanouchi and Takata, 2020; AMAP, 2021). According to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2021): \u2018Feedbacks from the loss of summer sea ice and spring snow cover on land have contributed to amplified warming in the Arctic (high confidence), where surface air temperature has likely increased by more than double the global average over the last two decades\u2019 (IPCC, 2021, \u00a71). The concern about this scenario, which is expected to continue throughout the 21st century (IPCC, 2021, \u00a7TS.4.3.2.8), is linked to the debate about the possible linkage between the Arctic amplification and the extreme climate anomalies detected at global level, for mid-latitudes (Francis and Vavrus, 2012; Ye et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2014, 2020) or at local level, for the Siberia region. In this last case, different extreme events have been observed such as the recent heat wave in 2020 (Overland and Wang, 2020) or a \u2018Warm Arctic-Cold Siberia (WACS)' pattern (Wegmann et al., 2018; Tyrlis et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021), although this expression could be misleading (Koenigk and Fuentes-Franco, 2019). In fact, Siberia exhibits the highest climatic variability of the entire Northern Hemisphere (NH), that is, 1.39\u00a0\u00b0C\/100 years versus 0.77\u00a0\u00b0C\/100 years in NH (Groisman et al., 2013a, p.72), so could be also considered as a valuable precursor of global climate changes. However, there are few studies focused on Siberia surface air temperature (SAT) trends, and even fewer, from the perspective of long-range dependence (LRD). In fact, we have not found a single study on Siberian temperatures using the methodology of fractional integration used in the present work.\nThis paper investigates the time trend coefficients in the monthly temperatures of 40 Siberian stations over the period 1937\u20132020. However, instead of using classical approaches that first remove the deterministic terms and then model the noise term, we use a more efficient approach based on fractional integration, that allows for long memory, a feature widely observed in climatological time series data (Bloomfield, 1992; Percival et al., 2001; Caballero et al., 2002; Franzke, 2010, 2012a; Gil-Alana, 2006, 2012; Rea et al., 2011; Bunde and Ludescher, 2017; Li et al., 2021). According to Franzke (2012a, p.22): \u2018There is increasing evidence that surface temperatures are long-range dependent\u2019. In fact, \u2018long-range dependence has the property that spatially coherent anomalies persist for a long time\u2019 (Franzke et al., 2020, p.3). Some examples based on this approach and referring to high-latitudes, can be found in Franzke (2012b), Gil-Alana (2012), L\u00f8vsletten and Rypdal (2016) or Myrvoll-Nilsen et al. (2019), showing all of them clear evidence of warming in this area. The novelty of this work is precisely the econometric specification used to analyze the Siberian data, incorporating in a single framework statistical features such as non-zero means, time trends, seasonality and long range dependence.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 summarizes the main empirical evidence about this topic. Section 3 describes the methodology applied in the paper. Section 4 presents the data and source used. Section 5 analyses the empirical results obtained, while Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\n\n2\nLiterature review\nResearch on climate variability in the Arctic (poleward of 60\u00b0 N) warns of a significant and accelerated warming trend in Arctic SAT since the beginning of the 20th century, particularly in the last decades, that exceeds the average trends observed in the Hemisphere North or on a global scale (Bekryaev et al., 2010; Johannessen et al., 2016; Davy et al., 2018; Przybylak and Wyszy\u0144ski, 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Cohen et al., 2020; IPCC-AR6, 2021, p.3562). This phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA) has been widely debated for decades as it is a key issue for understanding the global climate system (Screen and Simmonds, 2010; Serreze and Barry, 2011; Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014; Franzke et al., 2017; Davy et al., 2018; Yamanouchi and Takata, 2020; Walsh, 2021). Different phases of warming and cooling have been identified during the AA process (see, for example, Fyfe et al., 2013; Johannessen et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2020). Following Xiao et al. (2020) we distinguish a first phase of warming over the period 1920\u20131938, known in the literature as the Early Twentieth Century Warming (ETCW) and characterized by very strong positive trends; a subsequent cooling phase (1939\u20131976); and again, a warming phase from 1977, which exhibits positive trends higher than those registered in the ETCW period (+0.54\u00a0\u00b0C decade\u22121 for 1977\u20132018 versus +0.45\u00a0\u00b0C decade\u22121 for 1920\u20131938). However, in the mid-1990s, an apparent regime change is detected that highlights the rapid warming of the Arctic region (Przybylak, 2007; Bekryaev et al., 2010; Johannessen et al., 2016; Przybylak and Wyszy\u0144ski, 2020). In particular, Przybylak and Wyszy\u0144ski (2020) analyze the sub-periods 1976\u20132015 and 1996\u20132015, finding positive trends of +0.68\u00a0\u00b0C decade\u22121 and\u00a0+\u00a00.86\u00a0\u00b0C decade\u22121, respectively. These results suggest that, from 1996, warming trends in the Arctic become faster and more uniform than those observed in the ECTW period, which is named by Przybylak and Wyszy\u0144ski (2020) as \u201crecent rapid Arctic warming\u201d (RRAW).\nDespite these results, there is no clear consensus on the time evolution of Arctic SAT trends due to the disparity of methodologies, models and datasets used. Focusing on the methodology that concerns us, -the study of the LRD-, the references are even more scarce. For example, we can cite the study by Franzke (2012b) referring to the Eurasian Arctic region (>60\u00b0N). The author uses daily mean temperatures from 109 stations and applies three different null models \u2013AR (1) as an SRD model; ARFIMA (0, d, 0) as an LRD model (Robinson, 2003); and the phase scrambling method (Theiler et al., 1992), as a non-parametric model\u2013, to introduce different degrees of significance. His results show warming trends in all the stations analyzed. Among them, 16 stations located in the North Atlantic, Scandinavia and Northeast Russia show moderate or weak evidence of these models and only one station located in Iceland shows strong evidence against the 3 null models. For Siberia, the author finds positive but non-significant trends of approximately 0.2\u20130.3\u00a0\u00b0C decade\u20131, which would be within the range of natural climatic fluctuations. In addition, the work of Gil-Alana (2012) based on the Robinson (1994) methodology and applied to the monthly mean temperatures of 19 stations in Alaska, also reveals significant warming trends during the last 50 years for this region. In L\u00f8vsletten and Rypdal (2016) the regional linear trends in the 5\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00b0, 2\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00b0 grid areas are evaluated for the period 1900\u20132013 under the null hypothesis of LRD for internal climate variability. Their results show significant warming trends for 80% of the grid cells analyzed, reflecting the observed global warming at a regional level. These results are consistent with Myrvoll-Nilsen et al. (2019). The authors, applying Bayesian inference and assuming LRD noise, find positive trends in much of the land surface (more than 84% of the grid points analyzed), but especially in the Arctic, which is related to the AA phenomenon.\nOther related papers to the present one are Yaya and Akintande (2019), Gil-Alana et al. (2019) and Yaya and Vihn (2020). In Yaya and Akintande (2019) the authors investigate global and regional sea surface (SS) and land air surface (LS) temperature series from 1880 to 2016 using fractional integration with the possibility of structural breaks. Nonlinear trends and long memory are found in the two complete series as well as in the numerous subsamples. In Gil-Alana et al. (2019) they look at temperature and rainfall data in several regions in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using I(d) models, they find evidence of anti-persistence (d\u00a0<\u00a00) and short memory (d\u00a0=\u00a00) behaviour for the rainfall data but long memory (d\u00a0>\u00a00) for the temperatures. In Yaya and Vihn (2020) the authors examine average rainfall and temperature readings of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam, for the time period from 1901 to 2016. They also use fractional integration and found evidence of anti-persistence for the rainfall series of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam while long memory is found in the rainfall series of the remaining countries and also in the temperatures.\n\n\n3\nTime trends, seasonality and persistence\nSeveral issues will be examined in the monthly temperatures in Siberia. Firstly, we want to determine if long memory or long-range dependence is present in the data, and, for this purpose, we will make use of a parametric model based on fractional integration, that means that the number of differences required in the series to render it stationary I(0) may be a fractional value. In other words, an integrated of order d process may be specified as:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nB\n)\n\nd\n\n\nx\nt\n\n=\n\nu\nt\n\n,\n\nt\n=\n1,2\n,\n...\n,\n\n\n\nwhere B refers to the backshift operator, i.e, Bkxt\u00a0=\u00a0xt-k, and ut is an integrated of order 0 or I(0) process. Long range dependence or long memory takes place when d is positive, implying a large degree of association between the observations even if they are far apart. If d\u00a0=\u00a00, the process is short memory and if d is negative, it shows \u201canti-persistence\u201d implying that the series reverts to its original trend more often than expected in a pure random series. In addition, we also want to determine if time trends are present in the data and for this purpose we impose a linear time trend model of the form:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\ny\nt\n\n=\n\u03b1\n+\n\u03b2\nt\n+\n\nx\nt\n\n,\n\nt\n=\n1,2\n,\n...\n,\n\n\n\nwhere yt indicates the observed data, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 refers respectively to a constant and a linear time trend. In this context, a significant positive value of \u03b2 indicates support of warming temperatures across time.\nFinally, and based on the monthly nature of the data, we also include a seasonal component, that we model throughout a simple autoregressive AR(1) model of the following form.\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nu\nt\n\n=\n\u03c6\n\nu\n\nt\n\u2212\n12\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\nt\n\n,\n\nt\n=\n1,2\n,\n...\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b5t is a white noise process.\nThen, the model specification is the one based on equations (1)\u2013(3), i.e.,\n\n(4)\n\n\n\ny\nt\n\n=\n\u03b1\n+\n\u03b2\nt\n+\n\nx\nt\n\n,\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nB\n)\n\nd\n\n\nx\nt\n\n=\n\nu\nt\n\n,\n\n\nu\nt\n\n=\n\u03c6\n\nu\n\nt\n\u2212\n12\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\nt\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere yt is the time series we observe, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are unknown coefficients for the intercept and the linear trend; the regression errors xt are I(d), and ut is a seasonal (monthly) AR(1) process of the form as in Eq. (3) where \u03c6 is the AR coefficient and \u03b5t is a white noise process.\n\n\n4\nData\nThe time series used in this paper are taken from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M, version 4) temperature dataset which collects the monthly mean temperature of more than 25,000 stations around the world (https:\/\/www.ncTdc.noaa.gov\/ghcn-monthly). For our paper, we have selected 40 Siberian stations for the period 1937m01\u20132020m12 -which implies 1008 registers for each time series, which is large enough to justify fractional integration methods-, covering latitudes spanning from 50\u00b0N (Kosch-Agach) to 80\u00b0N (Ostrov-Oshakova). The choice of the stations is based on data availability. The names of the stations and their location in terms of longitude and latitude are displayed in Table 1\n. Fig. 1\n shows the latitudinal position of Siberia and Fig. 2\n displays the geographical location of each of the stations across the region.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, this paper focuses on the Federal District Siberia, one's of largest district of the Russia Federation which extends along northern Asia. This region borders to the north by the Arctic Ocean; on the south by Kazakhstan, China, and Mongolia; on the west by the Ural Mountains and on the east, by the Pacific Ocean. In particular, \u2018Siberia is comprised of the entire area of Russian Federation east of the Ural Mountains except for the monsoon climatic areas of the Russian Far East and Beringia\u2019 (Groisman et al., 2013b, p.2). Its vast territory occupies almost 30% of Russia's territory, being its major geographical zones the Central Siberian Plateau and West Siberian Plain. Siberia is also characterized by low population density, severe climate variability, enormous forest area, and a rich diversity of natural resources, which makes it a strategic area to consider (See Portnov, 2006; Na\u00famov and Collins, 2006; Groisman et al., 2013b; Mueller et al., 2015; Knaub and Ignateva, 2021; Kalikhman and Enkh-Amgalan, 2022).\n\n\n5\nEmpirical results\nOur first specification is the one based on equation (4). Table 2\n displays the estimates of d under the three standard assumptions of i) no deterministic terms, i.e., imposing \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00 in the first equality in (4); ii) with an intercept (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00) and iii) with an intercept and a linear time trend. We mark in bold in the table the most adequate specification for each case. The first thing we observe in the table is that the time trend is not required in any single case; the intercept in 16 stations, while no terms are required in the remaining ones. Table 3\n displays the estimated coefficients for the selected model of each station.\nIf we focus now on the estimated values of d, in Table 3, the first thing we notice is that all values are significantly positive, thus showing a long memory pattern. The lowest estimate corresponds to Verhnjaja_Gutara (d\u00a0=\u00a00.12) followed by Pudino, Minusinsk, Hamar Daban and Ust Koksa (with d\u00a0=\u00a00.14), while the highest values refer to Nizhneangarsk (d\u00a0=\u00a00.26) and Orlinga (0.30). We notice that the estimates of d are in all cases significantly below 0.5 implying that stationarity holds in all the series examined at least in relation with the zero or long run frequency. However, another interesting feature observed in these results is the one displayed in the last column of the table, showing the estimates of the seasonal AR(1) coefficient, \u03c6, in equation (4). We see that the value is very close to 1 in all cases, ranging between 0.912 (Dikson) and 0.970 (Nizhneangarsk). Based on these large values, we conduct seasonal unit root tests on the series, following the classical approaches developed in Dickey, Hasza and Fuller (DHF, 1984) and in Beaulieau and Miron (Beaulieu and Miron, 1993) for monthly time series data. The results, though not reported, support the hypothesis of nonstationary unit roots in all series. Thus, in what follows we work with the first monthly differenced series.\n\nTable 4\n displays the estimates of d for each station now in the model given by\n\n(5)\n\n\n\ny\nt\n\n=\n\u03b3\n+\n\u03b4\nt\n+\n\nx\nt\n\n,\n\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nB\n)\n\nd\n\n\nx\nt\n\n=\n\nu\nt\n\n,\n\n\n\nthough the coefficients for \u03b3 and \u03b4 were found to be insignificant in all cases. Thus, we only report the estimates of d under the assumption that \u03b3\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b4\u00a0=\u00a00. The second column in the table refers to the case where ut in (5) is a white noise process, while in column 3 we report the results under the assumption of weak autocorrelation, using a non-parametric approach due to Bloomfield (1973). This latter method approximates highly parameterized AR structures with very few parameters and accommodates very well in the context of fractional integration. Starting with the results based on white noise errors, we observe that the estimates of d are significantly positive in all cases, thus, supporting once more the hypothesis of long memory. The lowest estimates are obtained at Verhnjaja Gutara (0.09) and Pudino, Minusinsk, Hamar Daban and Ust Koksa (0.11) while the highest ones correspond to Nizhneangarsk (0.23) and Orlinga (0.27), i.e., the same stations as those reported in Table 3.\nHowever, if autocorrelation is permitted, a very different picture emerges and the long memory feature observed in the previous column has now disappeared, observing a substantial reduction in the degree of integration of the series. Thus, the estimates of d move now from \u22120.14 (Achinsk) to 0 (Sernoe) and the only positive value of d is found in the case of Nizhneangarsk (d\u00a0=\u00a00.13). Nevertheless, the null hypothesis of short memory behavior (i.e., d\u00a0=\u00a00) cannot be rejected in any single case. This reduction in the degree of dependence observed when autocorrelation is permitted might be simply a consequence of the competition between the two structures (i.e., the fractional one, measured by d, and the one caused by the Bloomfield model, 1973) in describing the time dependence. However, since Bloomfield (1973) uses a non-parametric method to describe the autocorrelation, no direct comparison is possible between the two structures. Further research should be conducted to investigate this relevant issue.\nAs a final issue we investigate if the results presented are stable across time. Based on the three subsamples proposed in Xiao et al. (2020), we re-estimate d for the first monthly differences in the model given by equation (5) for the two last subsamples, i.e., 1939m1 \u2013 1976m12, and 1977m1 \u2013 2020m12. (Note that for the first subsample only 24 observations are observable). The results for the case of white noise errors are displayed across Table 5\n, while those based on AR errors are displayed in Table 6\n.\nIn general, as in the previous results, lower values of d are observed under autocorrelation. Starting with the case of white noise errors, we observe a reduction in the value of d in the second subsample (in 23 out of the 40 cases), and if ut is autocorrelation, the reduction in d takes place in 26 cases. However, the differences are almost insignificant. Thus, with white noise errors, there are only three stations with a significant difference in the estimate of d across the subsamples: Turuhansk and Tura, with a significant reduction in d, from 0.24 to 0.07 in the former station, and from 0.27 to 0.11 in the latter one. On the contrary, for Orlinga, there is an increase from 0.08 to 0.39.\nIf ut is autocorrelated, using the model of Bloomfield (1973), Table 6, the I(0) hypothesis of short memory cannot be rejected in almost any station (the only two exceptions being Turahansk in the second subsample, and Hamar_Daban in the first subsample, and more importantnly, there are no significant differences across the two subsamples.\nAs a final issue, and taking into account the results in Przybylak and Wyszy\u0144ski (2020) that suggest a warming trend from 1996, we also examine the original data starting at 1996m01, no observing substantial differences with the results reported in this work.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this paper we have examined the monthly mean temperatures in 40 selected Siberian stations in order to determine if long memory is present in the data. Along with this, other important features in the data have been examined such as the potential presence of trends and seasonality issues. Our preliminary results support the hypothesis of long memory in all stations with significant positive values of the differencing parameter, though at the same time the seasonal coefficient was found to be very close to 1 in all cases examined. Due to this, seasonal unit root tests were conducted, supporting the hypothesis of nonstationary seasonality. Taking first seasonal differences, the results differ depending on the assumption made on the error term; thus, if the errors follow a white noise process, long memory is still present in the data, however, if autocorrelation is permitted, this evidence disappears in favor of a short memory pattern.\nFurther results should be conducted on these data to provide definite conclusions about their behavior. Thus, for example, semiparametric methods to identify long memory can be conducted to avoid the need of specification for the error term. In addition, non-linear structures can also be taken into account to determine if the issue of long memory is simply a spurious phenomenon caused by the presence of nonlinearities in the data. In this line, the linear trend can be replaced by Chebyshev polynomials in time, Fourier functions or neural networks in the fractionally integrated model as it has been proposed respectively in Cuestas and Gil-Alana (2016), Gil-Alana and Yaya (2021) and Yaya et al. (2021). Work in these directions is now in progress.\n\n","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe erosion of the Arctic coasts reflects the complex interaction between climate, coastal morphology and geology in which the unique environmental conditions related to permafrost are subject to thermal and mechanical instability (Are, 1988). Field observations identified various erosion mechanisms such as a bluff failure by niche erosion (thermoabrasion), bluff face thaw (thermodenudation), retrogressive slumping processes in the Arctic coasts, either separately or in combinations\u00a0(Vijay et al., 2018). The models by Nairn et al. (1998), Kobayashi et al. (1999), Leont\u2019yev (2003, 2004), Hoque and Pollard (2009), Ravens et al. (2012) and Barnhart et al. (2014) describe the Arctic coastal erosion as an effect of the hydrodynamic and thermal driving forces on standardised one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) coastal profiles to simulate coastal erosion because of the thermoabrasion process. Thermal energy transfer based on air\u2013water\u2013soil temperature profiles, thawing of permafrost and the degradation of the mechanical strength of the soil are ignored in most of the existing conceptual models (Lantuit and Pollard, 2008). Comprehensive models of coastal erosion, including the effects of the thermodenudation process, have not yet been developed\u00a0(Vijay et al., 2018). Meanwhile, observations from the various Arctic coasts suggest that the ongoing and foreseen thermokarst activities lead to considerable erosion by thermodenudation. For example, we expect the thawing of permafrost to increase unprecedentedly in connection with the effects of climate warming\u00a0(Lewkowicz, 1991). Temperature increase within permafrost will lead to an increased rate of thawing of soil ice and may speed up Arctic coastal erosion\u00a0(Bernstein et al., 2008).\nThe permafrost is linked with the surrounding atmosphere by an active layer, vegetation and snow covers which may vary enormously with time and location\u00a0(Romanovsky and Osterkamp, 1997). The active layer thickness (or the depth of the seasonal thawing) is usually estimated from satellite images, from in-situ measurements or using some semi-analytical formula. The semi-analytical formulas are based on a functional relationship between thawing depth, air temperatures and the soil\u2019s thermal properties\u00a0(Lantuit and Pollard, 2008). The Stefan-type equations (\n\nx\n=\nm\n\u22c5\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\ni\nn\nd\ne\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\nT\n\n\ni\nn\nd\ne\nx\n\n\n is the thawing index, \nm\n is related to thermal properties of soil, and \nx\n is the thawing depth) are widely used to predict the depth of permafrost thawing or to estimate the thermodenudation rate\u00a0(Romanovsky and Osterkamp, 1997). Similar simplified analytical solutions or empirical relations between the thawing depth and temperature measurements are also applied\u00a0(Gu\u00e9gan, 2015; Romanovsky and Osterkamp, 1997). Limitations of all the above formulas are: (a) unable to model temporal and spatial variation of the soil temperatures, (b) the models are forced to use spatial- and temporal-averaged values of temperature and (c) restricted to assume constant thawing\/freezing temperatures regardless of the variations in the soil properties (e.g.\u00a0effect of the salinity, organic matter on the freezing temperature cannot be assessed)\u00a0(Gu\u00e9gan, 2015). Only continuous and high resolution (both temporal and spatial) soil temperature profiles can solve the aforementioned limitations. Unlike other environmental parameters, we rarely measure the soil temperature on a regular basis\u00a0(Holmes et al., 2008).\nIn this study, we adopt analytical closed-form solution to describe the temporal variation of the soil temperatures at various depths (we focus on the active layer and the shallow permafrost from 0.5 m to 10 m). We base the solution on the classical 1D heat convection\u2013diffusion equation to describe the heat transfer in the soil with boundary conditions assuming temporal temperature variation at the air\u2013soil interface to be periodic. The temperature variation at the soil surface expressed as a harmonic function is a suitable boundary condition to depict the seasonal variations. The combinations of the multiple harmonic functions can capture variations with higher accuracy and prediction errors are smaller. We proceed by calibrating and validating the solution against various consecutive years (from 2014 to 2018) of continuous full-scale data of soil temperatures (from 0\u00a0metre to 9.9 m depths) at five different locations representing different geological and meteorological conditions at Baydaratskaya Bay, Kara sea, Russia. For the calibration, we use the first 80% of the data and apply machine learning algorithms to estimate parameters like temperature wave-amplitude reduction rate, temperature wave-phase lag, soil thermal diffusivity and liquid water flux density. The remaining observations are used for the validation of calibrated solutions. The calibrated and validated solutions for the Arctic coasts presented in this paper may be used to (1) hindcast, and forecast soil temperatures at various depths of the soil on the basis of temperature measurement at or near the surface, (2) estimate the thawing depth and thawing rates during the summer and refreezing during the winter; taken into account the variation of the freezing\/thawing temperatures with the soil properties, and (3) improve the understanding of the thermodenudation initiation process and hence improve the capabilities of Arctic coastal erosion models.\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nSeasonal variation of temperature in the Arctic coasts\nIn this section, we use full-scale observations to establish an understanding of the problem. A comprehensive description of the full-scale data is provided in Section\u00a03.3. Here, we present one temperature profile (see Fig.\u00a01) only as a sample of the measurements.\n\nFig.\u00a01 shows temperature measurements at three different depths, i.e.,\u00a0at 0.4 m, 2.15 m, and 4.4 m. The three temperature measurements are about 880 days, which means each time series consists of at least two summers and two winters. Each of the three chosen observations represents a certain layer of the soil in the Arctic. Typically, the active layer on which some vegetation can be seen is 0.5 m to 1\u00a0metre deep. The layer below the active organic layer is the transitional active layer. It is low on organic material; but subject to annual freezing and unfreezing, i.e.\u00a0during summer, the soil is free of ice. The layer at 4.4 m is permafrost. The temperature at the permafrost layer never rises more than zero degrees, i.e.\u00a0during summer, the layer stays frozen.\nA sine-wave is fitted on each of the observations (red line). Attempts are made to represent the seasonal temperature variations with a single harmonic function. One of the earliest model is the sine-wave model, where the periodical temperature changes are described using a single harmonic function (a sine function with time period of 365 days).\u00a0Van\u00a0Wijk and De\u00a0Vries (1963) and\u00a0Andersland et al. (2003), proposed the following equation to express the temperature variation at any depth in the soil: \n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n(\nz\n,\nt\n)\n\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n+\n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n\u22c5\ns\ni\nn\n\n(\n2\n\u03c0\nt\nf\n+\n\u03d5\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nT\n\n\nm\n\n\n is the mean temperature, \n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n is the amplitude of the harmonic sine wave, \nf\n is the frequency of the wave, \nf\n interchangeable with \n\u03c9\n\n (\n\n=\n2\n\u03c0\nf\n\n) -the angular frequency, \n\u03d5\n is the phase of the wave. As shown in the Fig.\u00a01, the amplitude, \n\n\nT\n\n\na\n\n\n and the phase, \n\u03d5\n are different at two depths but the frequency, \nf\n remains the same. When Eq.\u00a0(1) is applied to Arctic coasts temperature measurements (as shown in Fig.\u00a01) where temperature variations also follow a periodical cycle, some deviations are noticed. The errors of fitting a sine-waves are prominent close to the peaks, which are again greater at a depth of 2.15 m when compared with 0.4 m and 4.4 m of depth. According to our understanding, the significant cause of such deviations is due to the requirement of latent heat of phase-change. The effect of phase change on the deviations are (1) delay in reaching the peak and (2) sometimes slightly lower amplitude at the peaks.\nTo model the above observations, one can in principle solve the heat balance equation in porous medium as shown in Eq.\u00a0(2) with boundary and initial conditions\u00a0(Plaxis, 2021). \n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n\n\nn\nS\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nw\n\n\n+\nn\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nS\n)\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nv\n\n\n+\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\nn\n)\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\u2207\n\u22c5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\u0332\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\u0332\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nQ\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\ne\n\n\nw\n\n\n, \n\n\ne\n\n\nv\n\n\n and \n\n\ne\n\n\ns\n\n\n are the internal energy in the water, vapour and solid phases, \n\n\nQ\n\n\nT\n\n\n is the heat source term, \n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\u0332\n\n\n\nw\n\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\u0332\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n are the advective internal energy flux in water, vapour and soil (porous medium), \nn\n is porosity of the soil, \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nw\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nv\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\ns\n\n\n are the density of the water, vapour and soil.\nIt is possible to solve Eq.\u00a0(2) numerically, but one has to pay special attention to the phase change and enforce the right conditions at the moving boundary. We use the software Plaxis to solve Eq.\u00a0(2). Plaxis is a commercial finite element software developed to model geotechnical problems. The software features 2D deformation and stability analysis. It also includes a module that offers to simulate geothermal effects, heat flow within the soil, temperature distributions and phase change. The software can simulate temperature-dependent water properties which enables it to simulate permafrost in the Arctic coasts\u00a0(Plaxis, 2021).\nAs a boundary condition, the temperature measurements at 0.4 and 4.4 m are used and analyses are performed to simulate the temperature profile at 2.15 m. The numerical model is based on the porous medium\u2019s heat balance equation, including the major thermal processes such as conduction, convection by water and mass balance with phase changes, non-isothermal deformation, soil freezing, and unfreezing. Two different approaches are used, (1) considering the latent heat of phase change with measured parameters and (2) considering the depth-averaged equivalent thermal conductivity but ignoring the phase change. It is observed that the model, when not considering the heat loss and gain during a phase change, has almost the same level of error when compared with a model that considers the latent heats (Fig.\u00a02). When a whole cycle is considered, the energy required to melt the ice within the soil\u2019s pores at the active layers returns during the freezing phase if yearly averaged water content remains constant. At a yearly averaged value, the net effect of the heat flow changes due to latent heat of ice melting is cancelled out by the release of heat during the freezing. The figure also shows that neglecting the phase change can still be a good approximation if equivalent (calibrated) soil parameters are used. From this observation, we come to one of our main hypotheses in this study, i.e.,\u00a0the temperature variation in the permafrost can be modelled using a data-driven approach by solving 1D one-phase heat balance equitation with calibrated soil parameters, i.e.\u00a0solution to Eq.\u00a0(2).\n\nBased on this observation, a data-driven model is developed using the simplified conduction\u2013convection equation and the analytical solution. The solution of the equation is used to train the numerical model to find out the patterns and correlations between the time series of the temperatures at various depths. The analytical solution is the guiding principle for the algorithm to seek out the correlation and establish a localised custom relation between some basic parameters to predict the temperature at various depths. In the next sections, we describe the analytical solution used which is the basis of the pattern-seeking of the machine learning algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1\nSimplified thermal model\nA typical Arctic coastal profile is shown in Fig.\u00a03. A cliff stands at the end of a narrow beach. During the winter, the beach, bluff face and the cliff are covered with snow while the sea is covered with ice. Coastal erosion due to thermodenudation occurs during the summer after the snow is melted away. The direction of the heat transfer is downward during the summer when the air temperature is warmer than the soil temperature. The direction changes during winter as the air temperature near the surface becomes colder than the permafrost temperature. Our domain of interest is the Arctic coastal cliff and the narrow beach where thermodenudation occurs. In this study, we want to find a reliable method to estimate the temperature profiles inside the cliff and the beach, estimating the temperature on a large scale. This will allow an accurate estimate of the permafrost thawing depth and improve modelling of Arctic coastal erosion due to thermodenudation.\n\n2.1.1\nConduction\u2013convection heat equation\nTo estimate the temporal variations of the soil temperature at any depth, we idealise the problem as a one-dimensional (1D) heat transfer problem. Let us assume that points A and B are two points at different depths inside the cliff shown in Fig.\u00a03. The distance between these two points and the coordinate system used is shown in Fig.\u00a03. The axes \nx\n and \ny\n are assumed to be along the cross-shore and alongshore direction, respectively, the positive \nz\n-axis points to the downward direction.\n\n\n\n2.2\nGoverning equation to establish a data-driven model\nThe 1D heat convection\u2013diffusion equation can be used to describe the heat transfer in the soil between point A and point B. Based on the conservation of the energy, the Fourier thermal conduction and convection equation for the 1D case is expressed as:\u00a0(Stallman, 1965; Gao et al., 2003, 2008), \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n(\nz\n,\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\n2\n\n\nk\n\n(\nz\n)\n\nT\n\n(\nz\n,\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nz\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\nW\n\n(\nz\n)\n\nT\n\n(\nz\n,\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nk\n is the thermal diffusivity (unit = m2s\u22121) and \n\nk\n=\n\u03bb\n\/\nC\ng\n\n where \n\u03bb\n is the thermal conductivity (unit = Wm\u22121C\u22121) and \n\n\nC\n\n\ng\n\n\n is the volumetric heat capacity of the soil (unit = Jm\u22123C\u22121), \nW\n is the liquid water flux density. \n\nW\n=\n\u2202\nk\n\/\n\u2202\n\n\nC\n\n\nw\n\n\n\/\n\n\nC\n\n\ng\n\n\nw\n\u03b7\nz\n\n, \n\n\u2202\nk\n\/\n\u2202\nz\n\n is the gradient of the soil thermal diffusivity in z direction, \n\n\nC\n\n\nw\n\n\n is the heat capacity of the water (J\u00b0C\u22121m\u22123), \nw\n is the liquid water velocity(m\/s), \n\u03b7\n is the volumetric water content of the soil (unit-less).\nEq.\u00a0(3) is used as the governing equation of the problem; the equation is valid for every point regardless of the temperature profiles. However, the equation does not count for the heat sink or source at the melting phase due to the phase change of water. As we have seen in Section\u00a02, the effect of the phase change is the deformation of the sine wave and lag of the peak positive temperature.\n\n2.2.1\nBoundary conditions\nThe form of the fundamental solution of the Eq.\u00a0(3) depends on the boundary conditions. For \n\nz\n=\n\u221e\n\n or at sufficient deep soil, the solution of the equation reaches a steady state, i.e.\u00a0the effect of the surface-boundary conditions cannot be seen anymore. A time series of the temperature measurements can be applied as a boundary condition at point \nA\n. One of the properties of the heat equation is that it retains the initial shape of the boundary condition (detail example is provided in Appendix C). The time series at point \nA\n can be expressed as a known form of the function to reach the analytical solution. We considered the temperature measurements at point A (\n\nz\n=\n\n\nz\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n) as a function of time but a combination of harmonic functions with different amplitudes and time periods. Application of the boundary condition can lead to the respective solutions of Eq.\u00a0(3); presented in the next section.\n\n\n2.2.2\nAnalytical solution: a combination of harmonic functions as boundary condition\nApplying Eq.\u00a0(4) as a surface boundary condition to Eq.\u00a0(3) (as temperature profile at point A at a depth \nz\n), a solution to soil temperature \n\n\nT\n\n\nz\n\n\n can be expressed as shown in Eq.\u00a0(5) (see\u00a0Verhoef et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2016): \n\n(4)\n\n\nT\n\n(\nz\n=\n0\n,\nt\n)\n\n=\n\n\nT\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n+\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nn\n=\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\nf\n\n\nn\n\n\nt\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\nn\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\u2026\n,\nN\n\n\n\nThe effect of the phase changes is captured by the Fourier decomposition which a single sine wave model fails to do. The effect of change in the shape and the lag of the peak are accounted for when the time series is decomposed. Theoretically, the Fourier decomposition can be decomposed to N\/2+1 number of components where N is the number of observations.

The solutions are independent of the frequencies; the frequencies do not change over depth\u00a0(Van\u00a0Wijk and De\u00a0Vries, 1963). Field observations can help to calibrate the parameters of the solution. In this paper, we use the soil temperature observations of five different locations as boundary conditions to calibrate the parameters of the Eq.\u00a0(5). We used the temperatures from 0 to 9.9 m depths to calibrate the parameters: amplitude reduction rate, \n\nR\nR\n\n and phase lag, \n\nP\nL\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n3\nField measurements\nThe soil temperature has been measured at the coast of Baydaratskaya Bay in the Kara Sea. The field investigations are completed each year, started from 2012 under the leadership of the Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU) with support from the Centre for Research-based Innovation (CRI): Sustainable Arctic Marine and Coastal Technology (SAMCoT).\n\n3.1\nGeo-morphological description of the study area\nThe study area is a coast named Baydaratskaya Bay, a shallow gulf at the western side of the Kara Sea (Fig.\u00a04). The region is inside the Arctic circle, sparsely populated and with minimal access. Although many alluvial patches, lacustrine and deposits of boggy materials are found on the coast, mostly the Pleistocene marine and Glacial sediments created the area between the Yamal Peninsula and Yugra Peninsula. We believe the area was altered by the Pleistocene ice sheets, unlike the eastern Russian coasts. Massive ice beds are present in the study area. Visible Ice wedges polygons are found along the cliffs standing at the end of the beaches and contribute to the large collapses of blocks by thermoabrasion\u00a0(Ogorodov et al., 2020). The depression formed by the massive ice glaciers during the Pleistocene era developed the shallow gulf, and during the Holocene period, seawater submerged the area. The permafrost underneath the active layer is mostly continuous and reaches 30\u201370 m thickness. The gasoline pipe of Bovanenkovo-Uhta that transports gas to Europe passes the study area by 0.1 km in the SE direction\u00a0(Isaev et al., 2019). The total length of the study area is 8 km. The river Ngoyuyaha divides the area into two almost equal parts. The Baydaratskaya bay is not the only depression along the coast of the Kara Sea; there exist many similar depressions. Some active faults bound the basin at the west side. The north part of the bay is formed during the Pleistocene and Holocene. The clay and bottom mud found in the deeper part of the bay are well-sorted, fine sands along Ural shoreface and silty sand along Yamal coast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1\nZonal division based on cliff height: S#1 and S#2\nThe study area is divided into two distinct zones, marked S#1 and S#2, as shown in Fig.\u00a05[a]. The low marine terrace with bluff heights around 4\u20136 m is termed zone S#1. Zone S#2 has bluff heights of 10\u201317 m. The S#1 and S#2 sites are about 3.5 km in the N-W direction from the cofferdam of the Bovanenkovo-Uhta gas pipeline. The study area is spread from North West (68.867459N, 66.741529E) to East South (68.842112N, 66.984593E). The zone S#1 is a low marine terrace with a length of about 4 km, starts directly from the gas pipeline (the most south-eastern point). The low terrace surface (up to 6 m) is smoothly sloping. The top surface of the cliffs is grassy with minor swamped hollows; some shallow thermokarst lakes are present, ice-wedge polygons are visible on the soil surface, we find many erosion trenches along the coastline. The bluff-heights of the S#1, from the northwest, gradually lowers and transforms into a laida of 1.5\u20132 m height with the Ngouyaha river valley. A laida is a low lying land in the Arctic coasts flooded during the high tides, an Arctic counterpart of the marshland found in the warmer climate. The laida shoreline is almost 1.2 km long. The laida consists of depressions with frost-thaw lakes. Some of them are drained because of the retreat of the coastline. Lake occupancy on some of the high laida areas exceeds 50%. The lower sections of the laida are followed by the S#2 zone, a more elevated terrace of 10-17\u00a0m. This S#2 zone is 4.65\u00a0km along the coastline. Deep trenches more frequently cut the surface of the S#2 with dry thermokarst lake basins (hasyrey) and younger thermokarst lakes, polygonal-shaped frost clefts and weathering spots on the sandy soil. The cliffs mostly consist of fine sediments. Unlike the sandy dune systems of the warmer climate beaches, there is no active restoration mechanism to restore the cliffs. The soil profiles of the cliffs are depicted in Fig.\u00a06.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nSoil temperature measurements\nVarious boreholes are constructed in the study area to measure the temperatures (list of the boreholes provided in Table\u00a01). Initially, two boreholes were drilled, and temperature sensors were placed during field measurements of June 2013 (bh4, 6 m deep) and June 2014 (bh6, 3.5 m deep). Bh4 borehole was dug in the low terrace (S#1), and bh6 was on the high terrace (S#2). Boreholes were dug using handheld Augers, and M_log5\u00a0W (GeoPrecision GmbH) thermistors were placed inside them. A plastic pipe protects the boreholes to avoid internal collapse. The sensors of the thermistors are typically kept 0.3 m to 0.5 m apart. But near the surface, sensors are placed at 0 m and 0.1 m to capture the surface temperature. The time interval to record the data was set to be 12\u00a0h.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1\nIn situ thermal conductivity measurements\nLab tests of in-situ and post-work were performed to find the mechanical and thermal properties of the permafrost\/cliff during the field investigation (the summary of the thermal properties are in Table\u00a02). The experiment was performed on the cliff faces; due to the limitation of the equipment, the investigation was completed only till 1.64\u00a0m. Thermal conductivity was measured to be quite low on top of the organic active layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nField observations\nWe choose five sets of time series data for analysis where measurements are continuous and consistent. These observations are made throughout the year on the cliff and the beach of the Baydaratskaya. The earliest date of the measurements is 9 June 2014. The maximum length of the time series is 881 days (2.41\u00a0years; continuous), two periodical temperature variations are captured with the time series. The sensors measure the temperature at 12\u00a0h intervals. We lost some sensors to erosion. Moreover, temperature measurements at the deeper part of some boreholes were not appropriately captured because of some unknown sensor errors. As a result, data from all the nodes cannot be considered. The summary of the observations as time series is given in Table\u00a03. Observations from both the high and low cliff areas (S#1 and S#2) are available. The data are re-sampled for the daily averages since the time resolution of the data is 12\u00a0h, not small enough to capture the daily temperature variation of the site. The maximum depth of the sensor was 9.9 m in both S#1 and S#2 zones. However, some anomalies are observed within the measurement due to reasons of (1) interference by local people, some strings were lost, (2) reallocation of borehole due to erosion and (3) measurement errors. To avoid the unexplained and unwanted behaviours of the measured data, parts of some time series are omitted. However, the unprocessed measurements are added in the Appendix A for references. Fig.\u00a07 shows the time series of bh2; the rest of the time series are provided in the Appendix A.\n\n\n\n4\nCalibration of the parameters from field observation\nIn this study, we split the time series into two groups: training and testing data, adopting the machine learning approach. The training data set is used to calibrate the parameters of the solutions as mentioned in Table\u00a04,i.e.\u00a0the solution is fitted to the training data set to determine the parameters (\n\nR\nR\n\n and \n\nP\nL\n\n). Thereafter, the calibrated solutions are used to numerically reproduce the remaining data, i.e.\u00a0the testing data set. The calibration accuracy is determined by comparing the numerical prediction with the measurements, and the decision is made whether to accept the calibration or to re-calibrate the parameters. If the error is within the limit, the calibrated equation can be used as the governing equations to hindcast or forecast soil temperatures for the specific local area. The workflow of the methodology is shown in Fig.\u00a08.\n\n4.1\nPre-processing of the raw data\nThe field measurements contain some values which are clearly an error in the sensor. Before proceeding, these values were identified and cleared. Unusual values can greatly affect the quality of curve fitting. A trend within the time series may be observed. Since a trend is not considered when we sought the analytical solution, the trend must be removed before the calibrations.\n\n4.1.1\nRemoval of outliers\nAny observation over three times the median absolute deviations (MAD) away from the median is considered a measurement error and termed as an outlier. The outliers are replaced with the value generated by the piecewise cubic spline interpolation.\n\n\n4.1.2\nRemoval of trend\nThe observations from the field typically have an upward or downward trend of the mean temperature. A first-order \u2018detrend model is used to remove the trend from the observation. \n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\np\n,\nq\n\n\n=\n\n\nO\n\n\np\n,\nq\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\nq\n,\n1\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\nO\n\n\np\n,\nq\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the \np\n is the number of nodes along depth, \nq\n is the number of nodes in time-series, \n\n\nO\n\n\np\n,\nq\n\n\n is the matrix of the training data set and \n\n\nT\n\n\nq\n,\n1\n\n\n is the matrix of the de-trending parameters and \n\n\nY\n\n\np\n,\nq\n\n\n is the refined observations. When the calibrated solutions are used to make predictions, the trend values are required to be included.

The observations are divided into two groups: training and testing data-sets, as shown in the Fig.\u00a09 and detailed in Table\u00a04. The purpose of the testing data-set is to compare the output after calibration. For this study, we used 80% of the time-length of the observations as training data-set and the remaining 20% for testing data-set. The maximum days of the testing data-set is 178 days for bh2, and the minimum is 80 days for bh6, which we believe is enough to compare and estimate the errors. We could even use a higher percentage of the data-set to train the model since our problem poses no probability of a common error in machine learning: over-training. The training data-sets are used to calibrate the parameters of the Eq.\u00a0(5). Then only one observation at the topmost node for the time series is used to predict the temperatures at various depths, thus obtaining the predicted data-set. An error estimate is made comparing the observation in the testing data-set with the predicted data-set.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2\nCalibration using training data-set\nFor every time series, there are 5 to 20 measurements at the nodes at different depths (detailed in Table\u00a03). We retrieve the time series of the measurements at a 12-hour interval. Since the daily temperature variations cannot be captured when measured at 12-hour intervals, we convert the measurements to daily averages assuming that the average of the two 12-hour interval measurements represents the daily average temperature. The calibration starts with the Fast Fourier Transformation(FFT) analysis of the training data set. The output of FFT analysis on the bh2 time series is shown in Fig.\u00a010 as an example. The amplitude distribution shows that peak amplitude (n = 1) are always at the lower frequencies. The amplitude reduces exponentially along with the depth. The smaller amplitudes are found at the higher frequencies representing the smaller daily variations of the temperature. A summary of the amplitude and frequency distributions for all the time series are shown in the Fig.\u00a011. We notice that the peak frequencies of each series do not change along with the depth; it remains almost constant. However, the peak frequencies are not related to 365 days; rather, the time period ranges from 373 to 442 days. When a single sine-wave was fitted, the time period was always found to be 365 days. But when the time series is decomposed with FFT, the peak time periods are always found to be greater than 365 days. An amplitude and frequency distribution along the depth is drawn (Fig.\u00a012). The related parameters are described in Tables\u00a05 and 6. The amplitudes (\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n:\nn\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n.\n.\n.\n\n.) decays exponentially over the depth. An exponential curve \n\na\n\u22c5\n\n\ne\n\n\n\u2212\nb\nz\n\n\n\n with two parameters a and b fits the amplitudes distributions over the depth (see the distribution of the peak frequency in Fig.\u00a012). The results for the top three peak amplitudes are summarised in Table\u00a06. We notice that for n = 1, the highest peaks, the curve fittings have better \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n values, however, not all the curve fitting has a high \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n value, a value of 0.623 is also observed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1\nPhase-lags estimated from Cross Power Spectrum Density (CPSD) analysis\nCross Power Spectral Density (CPSD) was used to determine the true phase-lags between the signals at different depths. For a time series, CPSD between the top layer and that time series provides the cross power spectral density (CPSD) of the two signals, using Welch\u2019s averaged, modified periodogram method\u00a0(Welch, 1967) of spectral estimation. The phase difference is estimated as multiples of the \n\u03c0\n, which is converted to days as the maximum phase lag \n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n is equivalent to 365 days; shown in Fig.\u00a013. As the analytical solution suggests, the phase lag increases over depth. A linear equation: \n\na\n+\nm\n\u22c5\nz\n\n is fitted for each time series. The estimated values of the parameters are given in Table\u00a06. The \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n values suggest the relationship is well described by a linear equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2\nDiscussion on the calibration of the parameters\nThe following observations are made:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nFor a particular frequency, the amplitude decreases exponentially over the depth (see Figs.\u00a010 and 12). The dominant amplitudes reside at the lower frequencies. For most cases, the first few peaks are significantly higher than the rest (see Fig.\u00a011a). As expected, the longer the original signal, the stronger the peaks at the higher frequency (noticeable for bh5-1), indicating the model will be prone to errors if the higher frequencies are ignored.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe frequency of the peak amplitude remains constant along the depths (see Fig.\u00a011a). However, the peak frequencies are not the same for all boreholes. The observation suggests that the time period or seasonal variability has certain intervals and does not change within a short time.\n\n\n\u2022\nIt is also observed that the highest amplitudes are found in the first peaks (see Fig.\u00a011a). In other words, the peak with the highest time period also has the highest amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\nValidation of calibrated parameters and the solution using testing data-set\nAfter calibrated using the training data sets, the parameters are used to predict the remaining 20% of the testing data set. In this section, we discuss the predictions and assess the errors. The Fourier components are determined from the training data set. The amplitude distributions are found from the Fourier components over the depth for each frequency. An exponential curve is fitted to relate the amplitude reduction over the depth for each frequency. Once the parameters are estimated, a prediction of the testing data set can be made. One example of the prediction is shown in Fig.\u00a014. Along the \nx\n-axis, predicted temperatures and along the \ny\n-axis observed temperature are drawn. For a perfect prediction, the dots will be placed along the blue line which is drawn at a \n\n45\n\u00b0\n\n. Any deviation from the line indicates an error in the estimation. Only the bh2 time series is shown in the Fig.\u00a014. The rest of the time series can be found in Appendix E. The errors of the estimations are drawn along the depth in the sub-figures.\nThe following observations are made:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe models has quite a high error at the top layers. The high RMSE errors indicate the predictions model breaks down at the organic active layer.\n\n\n\u2022\nWhen single sine-waves were fitted along with the time series, it was found that sine-wave deviates from the observations at the summer peak temperatures; the observations were lagged and smaller in amplitude. In contrast to the single sine-waves, when a combination of the harmonic wave functions is used, the errors are more prominent at the lower peaks. i.e.\u00a0during winter. In other words, the summer temperatures are underestimated, whereas the winter temperatures are overestimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nSoil temperature measurements are available at the Arctic coasts in the Kara Sea, Russia. The beach consists of continuous permafrost. The study area has two distinct zones, S#1 with low 5 m high cliffs and S#2 with 12\u201315 m high cliffs. Boreholes are constructed and thermal strings are placed inside them to measure the temperature until the depth of 9.9\u00a0m. The seasonal temperature variations are observed to be periodic. The time series of the temperature measurements are modelled with the boundary conditions as a combination of the harmonic waves. In this study, we calibrated the parameters of the solutions and validated the analytical solutions.\nThe salient outcome of the analysis can be summarised as follows:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nThe seasonal variation of the temperature in the soil can be represented by the sine wave or combination of sine waves. The amplitude of such sine waves decreases exponentially. After 5 m of depth, the seasonal variations are small (less than one degree Celsius); we can neglect the variation.\n\n\n\u2022\nAt the core of the pattern-seeking algorithm of the data-driven model is the analytical solution of the conduction\u2013convection heat transfer equation. For the analysis, we calibrated the parameters only considering the depth-averaged values. But we notice that the errors created with such assumption are within the acceptable limit. The solution can be used to model a large area of the coast.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe local variations of the solution\u2019s parameters are captured within one single parameter, \n\nR\nR\n\n in Eq.\u00a0(6) for each frequency, i.e.\u00a0for each observation at a certain location, the value of \n\nR\nR\n\n is different. The smaller frequencies capture the effect of the heat sink or sources, such as latent heat of phase changes.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe phase-lag between the time series near the surface and the deeper part in the soil is considerable. The low thermal conductivity at the organic-active layer is one of the significant factors for the phenomenon. The summer high temperature of the soil at a depth of 5 m is almost 100 days behind that of surface temperature (see Fig.\u00a013). The analytical model suggests the phase-lag should have a linear relation with depth. The observations from the field confirm the linear relation. The phase lag is estimated to be around 20 to 25 days per metre of depth.\n\n\n\u2022\nZone S#2 has higher \n\nR\nR\n\n values and a lower water table, indicating very low to negligible heat transfer via convection. The error of the solutions is quite high in the shallow layers where surface run-off and precipitation during the summer is significant.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe deviations from the observed values are most prominent at the positive temperatures, i.e.\u00a0during summer. The solutions fail to capture the peak temperatures of the summer accurately.\n\n\n\nThe model did not consider the temperature profiles near the end of the cliffs, where the effect of the exposed bluff face on the temperature profile can be captured. Unlike the soil inside the cliffs, the crest and bluff-face are exposed to air on two planes. The temperature profiles will require corrections when the heat flows in two dimensions (2D). The precipitation and surface runoff from the flow of water of the thawing lakes were not considered. A separate model may be required to model the vegetation cover on the surfaces.

They are thought to derive from Antarctica or volcanic islands in the Southern Ocean, based on their mineral species. For example, Teitler et al. (2010) interpreted garnet grains in a sediment core from the Southern Ocean as ice-rafted debris (IRD) originating from a garnet-biotite gneiss, which was exposed in East Antarctica. Nielsen et al. (2007) proposed that tephra layers in sediment cores from the Southern Ocean originated from volcanic islands (the South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet Island). They were deposited as air-fall on sea ice and then rafted by the sea ice.\nHowever, in situ granitic and metamorphic rocks originating from Gondwana have also been recognized in the Southern Ocean, particularly in the Indian sector. For example, Ingle et al. (2002) reported conglomerates containing felsic igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks in drill cores obtained from the Elan Bank of the Kerguelen Plateau. In addition, Torsvik et al. (2013) reported Precambrian-aged zircon grains from young Mauritius lavas and suggested that Mauritius overlies a Precambrian microcontinent. Therefore, it is highly plausible that the granitic, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks recovered from the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean represent remnants of the breakup of Gondwana in this area.\nAngular rock clasts, including plutonic and sedimentary rocks, were recovered by dredging from the off-ridge portion of the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) during the KH-09-5 cruise of the Research Vessel Hakuho\nMaru. We examined the petrology, geochemistry, and geochronology of plutonic rocks from the SWIR. These data were then correlated with rocks from around the Southern Ocean to reveal a source of our SWIR rocks and to propose a process by which they became located there. The provenance and transportation mechanism of the plutonic rocks recovered from the middle latitude (around 45\u00b0 S) in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean have important implications for understanding distribution of IRD and dropstones in the Southern Ocean.\n\n\n2\nMethods and data\n\n2.1\nSamples\nThe SWIR is one of the slowest-spreading mid-ocean ridges in the world with a spreading rate of approximately 14\u201316\u00a0mm\/yr. A survey was conducted during cruise KH-09-5 of Research Vessel Hakuho\nMaru of a first-order segment of the SWIR between the Marion and Eric Simpson fracture zones at 34\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 E, where the spreading rate and direction were estimated to be 14\u00a0mm\/year and N15\u00b0E, respectively, from the NUVEL-1A model (DeMets et al., 1994). Sato et al. (2013) used detailed geophysical mapping to divide the first-order segment between 34\u00b0 E and 38\u00b0 E into four sub-segments, namely PE-1 to PE-4 from west to east. These subsegments were connected to non-transform discontinuities. Plutonic and sedimentary rocks were recovered by dredging from the seafloor of site KH-09-5DR06 (37\u00b000.02\u02b9 E, 44\u00b049.73\u02b9 S, 2165\u00a0m deep; Fig. 1\n).\nThe plutonic and sedimentary rocks from this site (sample ID KH-09-5DR06-01 to -06) were Mn-coated, pebble-sized clasts with angular to sub-angular shapes. Their petrographic characteristics are summarized in Table 1\n. Petrological, mineralogical, and geochemical studies, including radiogenic isotope analysis and 40Ar\/39Ar dating, were performed on two plutonic rocks with sample IDs of KH-09-5DR06-04 and -06 (Fig. 2\n). Sample KH-09-5DR06-04 contained fine-to medium-grained plagioclase, quartz, K-feldspar, and biotite with trace amounts of muscovite and opaque minerals. Although its texture appeared to be granoblastic, this sample is thought to be of igneous origin because of the scarcity of metamorphic and deformation textures, such as planar fabrics and recrystallization. Sample KH-09-5DR06-06 contained fine-to medium-grained plagioclase, quartz, K-feldspar, and biotite with trace amounts of opaque minerals, apatite, and zircon. Because the texture appeared to be granoblastic and the alignment of biotite formed weak foliation, it likely underwent weak metamorphism. A thin alteration zone (<1\u00a0cm thick) was observed as a pinkish band in the hand specimen. In the alteration zone, most plagioclase and biotite were altered, and muscovite was observed.\n\n\n2.2\nAnalytical methods\nThe major element compositions of the bulk rock samples were determined using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF, Supermini; Rigaku Corp.) spectrometer at Senshu University. Sample preparation and calibrations between intensity and concentration were conducted using the methods reported by Sato (2010).\nThe compositions of silicates and oxides were analyzed using an electron microprobe analyzer (EPMA, Superprobe 8900R; JEOL Ltd.) at the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo. The intensity was determined using a focused beam (<1\u00a0\u03bcm), an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV, and a beam current of 12\u00a0nA.\nWhole-rock trace element analyses were conducted using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, 7500c; Agilent Inc.) at the Department of Systems Innovation, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, following the procedures described by Machida et al. (2008, 2015). Detailed calibration methods are described in Machida et al. (2008), except for the calibration of the standard solution. Spectral overlaps from oxides and hydroxides were corrected using the correction method described by Aries et al. (2000). Analyses were generally within 2% of the accepted values for reference material JB-2, issued by the Geological Survey of Japan (GSJ), and the reproducibility of replicate analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a05) was typically <3% RSD.\nThe Zr contents of the plutonic samples differed substantially, depending on whether they were determined by XRF or ICP-MS. This discrepancy was perhaps caused by the presence of insoluble zircon grains. We therefore remeasured the Zr, Hf, and rare-earth element (REE) contents of our samples using ICP-MS on solutions prepared with an alkali fusion method. The method proposed by Awaji et al. (2006) was revised as follows: a mixture of 0.1000\u00a0g of powdered rock sample and 1.0000\u00a0g of pure flux (Li2B4O7) was fused in a Pt crucible at 1190\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u201320\u00a0min in a bead sampler. Each glass bead (0.0200\u00a0g) was digested completely with 50\u00a0mL of 2% HNO3\u2013HCl\u2013HF (20:5:1) mixed acid in a 50\u00a0mL\u00a0PP bottle and placed in an ultrasonic bath for up to 1\u00a0h. The solution was diluted to 1:25000 (mass ratio) using a matrix-matched solution (blank glass bead digested with 2% HNO3\u2013HCl\u2013HF mixed acid). The detailed procedure for the calibration and corrections to interference, except for that of the matrix-matched solution, were the same as for the acid decomposition method described above. The differences between our data and the accepted values for the GSJ standard JB-2 (basalt from the Oshima Volcano) and JB-3 (basalt from the Fuji Volcano) (Lu et al., 2007; Makishima et al., 2002; Makishima and Nakamura, 2006) were typically <5%.\nThe rock powder used in major and trace element analysis was also used for bulk rock Sr and Nd isotopic analysis. Sr and Nd isotope analyses were performed using thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS, TRITON Plus; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) with 9\u00a0F collectors at the National Museum of Nature and Science, Japan, following the procedures described by Machida et al. (2009, 2015). The total procedural blanks for Sr and Nd were less than 100\u00a0pg. The measured isotope ratios were normalized to 86Sr\/88Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.1194 and 146Nd\/144Nd\u00a0=\u00a00.7219. The NIST SRM-987 Sr standard had an average value of 0.710253\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000009, while the JNdi-1 Nd standard of GSJ had an average value of 0.512101\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000003.\nFresh and minimally weathered crystals, especially biotite, are suitable for single-grain stepwise laser fusion 40Ar-39Ar dating (Hyodo et al., 1999; Hyodo, 2008). Fresh biotite was selected from the samples for dating. The samples were crushed and sieved to a size of 200\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm and altered grains were then removed by handpicking and rinsed with pure water in an ultrasonic bath.\nSeparated biotite grains were irradiated in aluminum trays using a 5\u00a0MW Kyoto University Research Reactor with a uniform fast neutron flux density of 3.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013\u00a0cm\u22122\u00a0s\u22121 (Hyodo et al., 1999). The typical J-value for the Hb3gr hornblende standard (Roddick, 1983) was (2.531\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.040)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124, and correction factors for interfering isotopes were 40K\/39\u00a0K\u00a0=\u00a00.256\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.040 for potassium, and 36Ca\/37Ca = (3.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.82)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124, 39Ca\/37Ca = (1.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 for calcium. The following constants were used for age calculation: \u03bbe\u00a0=\u00a00.581\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\/year, 40K\u00a0=\u00a04.962\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\/year, and 40K\u00a0=\u00a00.1167 atom% (Steiger and J\u00e4ger, 1977).\nThe laser gas extraction and mass spectrometry procedures are described in Hyodo (2008) and references therein. Typical blanks for argon isotopes in the extraction system were 6.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214, 8.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214, 3.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214, 5.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214 and 2.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212 in cm3 for 36Ar, 37Ar, 38Ar, 39Ar and 40Ar, respectively. All analytical uncertainties are shown in Table 4 as the 2\u03c3 values.\nThe argon isotope ratios were corrected for mass discrimination, background, and blank values and for interfering neutron reactions on Ca and K. The age data obtained by stepwise heating were evaluated against the age spectra, obtained from plots of cumulative 39Ar vs. apparent ages and errors, using the following two criteria. First, the age spectrum forms a plateau that includes three or more consecutive steps, comprising >50% of the 39Ar released and with ages overlapping within 2\u03c3 errors. Second, the plateau ages are consistent within the error of the weighted mean of the step ages forming the plateaus. The statistical robustness of plateaus and plateau ages were tested by calculating the MSWD (mean square weighted deviation; should be \u226a3) and p (probability of fit; should be\u00a0>\u00a00.05) at 2\u03c3\/95% confidence levels (Baksi, 1999; Isoplot 4.15: Ludwig, 2012).\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nThe major element composition (Table 2\n) of the two plutonic rocks were characterized by intermediate SiO2 contents (63.9\u00a0wt% for KH-09-5DR06-04 and 61.2\u00a0wt% for KH-09-5DR06-06) and high total-alkali (Na2O\u00a0+\u00a0K2O) contents.\nBased on modal compositions, determined by point counting, and mineral chemistry, determined by EPMA (Table 3\n\n), sample KH-09-5DR06-4 contained 23 modal % quartz, 60% plagioclase (An17~32Ab65~81Or0.7~2), 6% K-feldspar (A\u00f10.2Ab5~10Or89~95), and 11% biotite (Mg# 42\u201344) with trace amounts of muscovite Mg# from 40 to 45) and opaques (1.3 modal %). The fresh part of sample KH-09-5DR06-6 consisted of 35 modal % quartz, 48% plagioclase (An24~27Ab71~74Or1~2), 4% K-feldspar (A\u00f10.1Ab7~10Or89~93), and 11% biotite (Mg# 46) with trace amounts of opaque minerals. Therefore, both samples were classified as tonalite. Sample KH-09-5DR06-06 was partly altered (degree of alteration ca. 20%). Muscovite was observed in the altered part.\nIn the N-MORB-normalized trace element patterns (shown in Fig. 3\n), both samples KH-09-5DR06-04 and KH-09-5DR06-06 show significant depletion in Nb, Ta, Sr, and Ti. Sample KH-09-5DR06-04 shows depletion in Zr, Hf, and Eu, relative to rare earth elements with similar incompatibility. Sample KH-09-5DR06-04 shows a strong downward pattern for heavy REEs, while sample KH-09-5DR06-06 exhibits a flat REE pattern for heavy REEs.\nWhole-rock Sr and Nd isotope data for samples KH-09-5DR06-04 and \u221206 are listed in Table 2. Initial ratios were calculated based on 490\u00a0Ma for KH-09-5DR06-04 and 475\u00a0Ma for KH-09-5DR06-06, following Ar\u2013Ar age determination. The 87Rb\/86Sr and 147Sm\/144Nd ratios were calculated based on the trace element compositions, and decay constants for 87Rb and 147Sm were 1.42\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211\/yr and 6.54\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212\/yr, respectively.\nThe age spectrum of biotite grains in sample KH-09-5DR06-04 displays a well-defined age plateau at 481.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8, 491.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9, and 488.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma for 99.8%, 100%, and 96.4% of 39Ar released, respectively (Fig. 4\n). Biotite in sample KH-09-5DR06-06 yielded integrated ages of 478.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5, 475.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4, and 476.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma for 100%, 93.4%, and 99.7% of 39Ar, respectively (Fig. 4).\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nOrigin of plutonic rocks from SWIR\nPlagioclase-rich leucocratic rocks, so-called \u201coceanic plagiogranite,\u201d have been identified in mid-ocean ridges and ophiolite complexes (e.g., Coleman and Donato, 1979). According to Coleman and Donato (1979), the chemical composition of oceanic plagiogranite is characterized by lower K2O content (usually less than 1%). Because our samples contain large amounts of K2O (Table 2), the plutonic rocks from the SWIR cannot be classified as oceanic plagiogranite.\nFragments of continental crust, including granitic and metamorphic rocks, are widely distributed in the Indian Ocean. For example, exposures of granitic and metamorphic rocks have been identified at Elan Bank on the Kerguelen Plateau (Ingle et al., 2002). Ingle et al. (2002) reported a fluvial conglomerate from Elan Bank containing clasts of volcanic rocks (alkali basalt, rhyolite, and trachyte), granitoid, and gneiss. They claimed that the gneiss clasts exhibited an affinity with continental crustal rocks from the Eastern Ghats Belt, India, and its possible East Antarctic corollary, the Rayner Complex. B\u00e9nard et al. (2010) compiled geological, petrological, and geophysical data and proposed the existence of remnant stretched continental crust, formed during the Gondwana breakup, beneath the Kerguelen Plateau.\nFurthermore, Torsvik et al. (2013) reported zircon xenocrysts with Paleoproterozoic (>1971\u00a0Ma) and Neoproterozoic (between 660 and 840\u00a0Ma) ages within young Mauritius lavas, and claimed that they might have been derived from an ancient fragment of continental lithosphere beneath Mauritius. They showed that thick crust(>25\u201330\u00a0km) extends southwards from the Seychelles to Mauritius. Ashwal et al. (2002) reported that granitic rocks formed during the Neoproterozoic (~750\u00a0Ma) are now exposed in the Seychelles.\nHowever, it is difficult to imagine that the plutonic rocks from the SWIR were derived from in situ exposure of remnant continental crust in the Indian Ocean because they were obtained in proximity to the present spreading center, and a magnetic anomaly was observed within ocean floor around the dredge site (Sato et al., 2013).\nAr\u2013Ar dating of biotite crystals in plutonic rocks from the SWIR gives ages of approximately 475\u2013490\u00a0Ma. Therefore, rocks related to the younger Mesozoic-Cenozoic orogeny at the Gondwana margin, such as those derived from the Antarctic Peninsula, can be excluded as candidates for the provenance of our plutonic rocks. Because sample KH-09-5DR06-06 was weakly metamorphosed, the Ar ages may represent the cooling age. Thus, the plutonic samples from the SWIR are interpreted as either weakly metamorphosed rocks affected by an orogeny around 500\u00a0Ma, or as plutonic rocks that formed during the orogeny.\nGondwana accreted during the Pan-African orogeny, from the late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic (e.g., Kr\u00f6ner and Stern, 2005). Dronning Maud Land (DML) in East Antarctica (Fig. 1), was part of this orogeny (e.g., S\u00f8r Rondane, eastern DML: Arakawa et al., 1994; Elburg et al., 2016; Kamei et al., 2013; Li et al., 2003; Owada et al., 2013, 2006; Ruppel et al., 2021; Tainosho et al., 1992; central and western DML: Grantham et al., 2011; Jacobs et al., 2015). Osanai et al. (2013) and Ruppel et al. (2021) interpreted Ar\u2013Ar ages ranging between ca. 600\u2013400\u00a0Ma as the cooling age of a long-lasting orogeny. In contrast, the Antarctic Ross and Australian Delamerian orogenies were active from 550 to 480\u00a0Ma over much of the Gondwana supercontinent, including Africa, South America, Australia, and East Antarctica (e.g., Allibone and Wysoczanski, 2002; Fitzsimons, 2000; Foden et al., 2006; 2002; Goodge, 2007; Goodge et al., 2004; Rocchi et al., 2009). Rocks related to the Ross orogeny are exposed along the Transantarctic Mountain in Antarctica (e.g., Palmer, 1987; Rocchi et al., 2009).\nThe overall N-MORB-normalized trace element patterns (Fig. 3) of the plutonic rocks from the SWIR are indistinguishable from those of rocks from DML, the S\u00f8r Rondane Mountains, and Transantarctic Mountains (Victoria Land). Sample KH-09-5DR06-04 is more enriched in Th and depleted in Hf, Zr, and heavy REEs compared to samples from DML, the S\u00f8r Rondane Mountains, and Victoria Land. KH-09-5DR06-06 has a similar normalized pattern to that of rocks from Victoria Land.\nThe two samples from the SWIR have enriched isotope compositions, characterized by low \u03b5Nd values (\u221214 to \u221220 for the present ratio). Although the \u03b5Nd values depend on ages for calculation, the estimated initial \u03b5 values are low (\u22128 to \u221213) (Table 2; Fig. 5\n). Granitic rocks from the Transantarctic Mountains have \u03b5Nd values of approximately \u22125 (Rocchi et al., 2009), and Paulsson and Austrheim (2003) and Grantham et al. (2011) reported even lower initial \u03b5Nd values (less than \u221210) for rocks from western DML. On the other hand, rocks from the S\u00f8r Rondane Mountains and central DML have higher \u03b5Nd values (more than \u22123: Tainosho et al., 1992; Arakawa et al., 1994; Kamei et al., 2013; Jacobs et al., 2015).\nTherefore, the Ar\u2013Ar ages, trace element compositions, and isotope ratios indicate that the plutonic rocks from the SWIR are similar to rocks from the Transantarctic Mountains or western DML.\nPatagonia, in South America, was also a part of Gondwana. The granitic and metamorphic rocks from this area were affected by the Ross orogeny, such as the formation of the Transantarctic Mountains (Ramos and Naipauer, 2014). They have similar geochemical characteristics to rocks from Victoria Land (e.g., Pankhurst et al., 2014, Fig. 3). Pankhurst et al. (2003) reported Rb\u2013Sr and U\u2013Pb zircon dating of pre-Permian rocks, most of which are exposed in the Deseado Massif, southern Argentina (Fig. 1). They reported that well-rounded felsic and granitic cobbles in the Dos Hermanos area include zircon grains with U\u2013Pb ages of 476\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma and 472\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma. According to Herv\u00e9 et al. (2008), plutonic and metamorphic rocks of ca. 500 Ma are exposed on Deseado Massif and Fuego Island. Therefore, the possibility of a South American origin for our rocks should be considered.\n\n\n4.2\nTransportation of plutonic rocks to SWIR\nThe plutonic rocks from the SWIR examined in this study have geochemical and isotopic characteristics similar to those of early Paleozoic continental-crust rocks from Gondwana. However, they are unlikely to be remnants of continental crust within the Indian Ocean, considering the location where they were recovered (as mentioned in section 4.1). Therefore, they were likely derived from somewhere surrounding the Indian Ocean and deposited on the SWIR as dropstones. Bennett et al. (1996) summarized the transportation of dropstones as occurring via 4 main methods: biological rafting, ice-rafting, floatation, and projectiles. Floatation and projectiles can be excluded because these processes usually involve volcanic rocks or fine-grained sedimentary clasts. Biological rafting methods\u2014gastroliths of marine mammals, stones in tree roots, and ship ballast\u2014are candidates for transportation. The plutonic rocks from SWIR are angular in shape, which is inconsistent with the rounded shape of gastroliths. It is possible that the plutonic rocks from the SWIR were transported from elsewhere as stones in drift-tree roots or ship ballast. However, we have no scientific lines of evidence to either confirm or reject those possibilities.\nAnother transport mechanism for dropstones is ice rafting. It is worth discussing this mechanism because the plutonic rocks from SWIR may have originated from Antarctica or South America, based on their petrology, geochemistry, and isotopes. Furthermore, smaller clasts\u2014including volcanic rocks and felsic minerals\u2014recovered in the Southern Ocean were thought to have been transported from Antarctica or adjacent areas by icebergs or sea ice (e.g., Manoj et al., 2013; Nielsen et al., 2007; Teitler et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2014).\nIRD has been recognized in sediment cores recovered from the Southern Ocean, including the Indian sector (Fig. 1). Nielsen et al. (2007) described the tephra-rich IRD in piston core TN057-14 from the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and concluded that it was derived from the South Sandwich Island volcanic arc. Teitler et al. (2010) also described IRD and dropstones in sedimentary core TN057-6-PC4 and concluded that they originated from East Antarctica, judging from the garnet grains present. Manoj et al. (2013) found tephra and volcanic fragments in sedimentary cores (SK200\/22a and SK200\/27) south of the SWIR. They concluded that the volcanic fragments were derived from the South Sandwich Island volcanic arc and transported via sea ice, whereas quartz grains were derived from Antarctica and transported on icebergs. IRD in the sediment core indicates the geological record, but our samples reflect a recent event because they were recovered by dredging from the seafloor surface (as mentioned in section 2.1). Therefore\u2014based on our results and conclusions of these previous studies\u2014IRD, dropstones of felsic rocks\/minerals, or garnet grains may have been derived from Antarctica.\n\nRomanov et al. (2017) reported the concentration of icebergs in the Southern Ocean from ship-based observations since the end of the 1940s. They revealed that the northern boundary of iceberg occurrence mostly coincides with the oceanic polar front (Orsi et al., 1995). They also pointed out that iceberg occurrence extends northward and reaches 44\u00b0\u201346\u00b0 S at 0\u00b0\u201330\u00b0 E. The samples examined in this study were recovered just east of this region. Although our dredge site is north of the polar front, as shown in Fig. 1, icebergs can sometimes travel beyond the polar front. Historically, icebergs were observed at middle latitudes beyond the polar front (e.g., Horsburgh, 1830: Fig. 6\n). Therefore, it is plausible that the sample location is the northeastern terminal of the iceberg array from the Weddel Sea (Weber et al., 2014). Because our plutonic rocks from the SWIR are considered to originate from the Transantarctic Mountains or western DML, two distinct delivery processes were considered (Fig. 6).\nThe first plausible process is that the rocks originated in western DML, were entrapped in an ice sheet and entered the Southern Ocean just off Antarctica, and then rafted by counterclockwise flow within the Antarctic Coastal Current to the Weddel Sea (Weber et al., 2014). Alternatively, as rocks that formed during the Ross orogeny were exposed along the Transantarctic Mountains, located upstream of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf and Ross Ice Shelf, they may have become entrapped in the ice sheet at the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf and entered the Weddel Sea, or in the ice sheet at the Ross Ice Shelf and entered the Ross Sea, and then rafted by counterclockwise flow within the Antarctic Coastal Current to the Weddel Sea (Weber et al., 2014).\nThe high-altitude area of South America was covered with an ice sheet during the last glacial maximum (e.g., Hulton et al., 1994). However, these areas do not overlap those where the early Paleozoic rocks are exposed. Therefore, the transportation of these exposed rocks by ice-rafting has not been possible since the last glacial maximum.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe recovered sedimentary rocks and plutonic dropstones from the off-ridge portion of the Southwest Indian Ridge. Two plutonic dropstones were analyzed in terms of petrography, petrology, geochronology, and geochemistry. The following are the results of this study:\n\n(1)\nBiotite shows an early Paleozoic (approximately 475 and 490\u00a0Ma) Ar\u2013Ar age. Although these dates may represent cooling ages, they indicate that the plutonic rocks likely originated in East Antarctica.\n\n\n(2)\nThe whole-rock trace element compositions of the samples are similar to those of rocks from the DML, S\u00f8r Rondane Mountains, and Transantarctic Mountain (Victoria Land). However, sample KH-09-5DR06-4 is enriched in Th and depleted in Hf, Zr, and heavy REEs, compared to rocks from DML, S\u00f8r Rondane Mountains, and Victoria Land. KH-09-5DR06-06 has a normalized pattern similar to samples from Victoria Land.\n\n\n(3)\nThe plutonic samples are characterized by low \u03b5Nd values (\u221214 to \u221220 for the present ratio and \u22128 to \u221213 for the estimated initial ratio). These values are similar to those of rocks from DML and the Transantarctic Mountains.\n\n\n\nBased on these similarities, we think it is more likely that these plutonic rocks obtained from the off-ridge portion of the SWIR were derived from DML or the Transantarctic Mountains in Antarctica, and were transported to their present location by icebergs. Small fractions of IRD and tephra have been found in sedimentary cores from the Arctic Ocean, but our plutonic dropstones are much larger than most known IRD. If our hypothesis is correct, the sample location must be close to the northern limit of the Antarctic iceberg trajectory. Thus, the presence of larger dropstones is key to understanding the iceberg movement in the Southern Ocean.\n\n","99":"","100":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSea ice reduction in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean has intensified over past decades, and is associated with the Pacific-origin water inflow from the Bering Strait (Shimada et al., 2006; Woodgate et al., 2010). Northward volume transport through the Bering Strait is intensified between May and October, and the annual mean transport increased from 0.7 Sv (2001) to 1.1 Sv (2011) (Woodgate et al., 2005, 2012). Heat flux through the Bering Strait has also increased. The trend in annual heat flux from 2002 to 2015 was 0.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01020\u00a0J\u00a0yr\u22121 (Woodgate, 2018). Water temperature is further increased by solar heating in the Chukchi Sea (Tsukada et al., 2018). The Pacific-origin water is steered into three routes (Fig. 1\na) following bottom topography in the Chukchi Sea (Weingartner et al., 2005). Most of the water reaches Barrow Canyon in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (Gong and Pickart, 2015; Itoh et al., 2013; Pickart et al., 2016).\nThe Pacific-origin water flowing into the Chukchi Sea in summer is traditionally referred to as the Pacific Summer Water (PSW). The PSW is mainly composed of the water transported along the Alaskan coast and that originates from the Gulf of Anadyr and the central Bering Sea shelf.\nHydrographic properties of the Pacific-origin water in the Canada Basin vary on a decadal timescale. The PSW in the basin showed a warming trend between 1997\u20132002 and 2007\u20132008 (Bourgain and Gascard, 2012). Its subsurface layer thickness increased between the late 2000s and early 2010s (Timmermans et al., 2014). Timmermans et al. (2018) proposed that PSW changes could be the cause of overlying sea ice loss.\nMany studies have focused on the transport of the Pacific-origin waters into the basin. After passing through Barrow Canyon, the Pacific-origin waters are transported directly into the interior of the Canada Basin or to the Chukchi\/Beaufort Sea shelf slope. For example, Nikolopoulos et al. (2009) indicated that the water exported from Barrow Canyon was transported eastward onto the Beaufort Sea shelf. Recent observations showed that the water was also transported westward and\/or flowed straight toward the Canada Basin (Brugler et al., 2014). The westward flow along the Chukchi Sea northern slope is called the Chukchi Slope Current (CSC) (Fig. 1a) (Corlett and Pickart, 2017; Spall et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Boury et al., 2020). Corlett and Pickart (2017) estimated the volume, heat, and freshwater transport of the Pacific-origin water using shipboard hydrographic and velocity data collected across the northern slope between 2002 and 2014 and found the CSC intensification in fall. According to the mooring observation across the northern slope from October 2013 to September 2014, the CSC flows near the surface in summer and fall (Li et al., 2019). In winter and spring, it weakens and moves shoreward and to the subsurface (Li et al., 2019). Satellite-tracked drifter observation in 2012 showed the CSC reaching Herald Canyon in the northwestern Chukchi Sea (Stabeno et al., 2018). The CSC has also been identified in a model experiment, which showed it transporting the PSW westward from Barrow Canyon to the subsurface layer in the western Chukchi Borderland (Watanabe et al., 2017).\nThe formation mechanism of the CSC has also been discussed in previous studies. The CSC is considered to be part of the Beaufort Gyre and intensifies as a function of gyre extent (Watanabe et al., 2017; Spall et al., 2018; Stabeno and McCabe, 2020). On the short timescale of approximately 1\u20135 days, the CSC is influenced by wind stress curl in the northeastern Chukchi shelf (Li et al., 2019). However, the CSC variations could not be explained by local wind (Spall et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019).\nSince the exact pathway and advection time of the PSW remains unknown, detailed understanding of PSW property changes along the CSC route would contribute to quantification of heat transport into the basin. In this study, we examined PSW properties using the mooring data obtained at Stations HSN\/NHC in 2003\u20132005 (Period 1) and 2015\u20132019 (Period 2) (Fig. 1a). We also investigated PSW modification along the CSC route between Barrow Canyon and Stations HSN\/NHC. Details of mooring, shipborne, and reanalysis data are provided in Section 2. Water properties observed on our mooring sites for Period 1 and 2 are described in Section 3. Comparison between temperature variability on the Chukchi Sea northern slope and that in Barrow Canyon is presented in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the factors for changes in PSW properties between the two regions. The findings are summarized in Section 6.\n\n\n2\nData\n\n2.1\nMooring\nIn this study, we analyzed hydrographic and velocity data obtained by moorings in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (Table 1\n). On the Chukchi Sea northern slope, moorings were located at 73\u00b0N, 160\u00b0\u2013161\u00b0W (Stations HSN\/NHC). The distance between the two moorings were approximately 20\u00a0km. The potential biases caused by this location difference was discussed in Section 5.4. The mooring at Station HSN was deployed from August 2003 to October 2005. Moorings at Station NHC collected the data from September 2015 to August 2019. Mooring data obtained at Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E in Barrow Canyon were also analyzed and compared with hydrographic properties on the northern slope. Moorings in Barrow Canyon were deployed from October 2003 to August 2019. Period 1 refers to 2003\u20132005, and Period 2 refers to 2015\u20132019. Mooring data using in this study are available from Arctic Data archive System in National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) (https:\/\/ads.nipr.ac.jp\/dataset\/A20210421-001). Moorings were equipped with conductivity\u2013temperature (CT) sensors and upward-looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) (Table 1). The CT sensors were calibrated before and after observation. The maximum drifts during each mooring period were \u00b10.001\u00a0\u00b0C for temperature and \u00b10.01 for salinity. We calculated daily mean temperature and salinity from hourly in-situ data to examine hydrographic properties. The 14-days running mean data calculated from hourly or every other hourly in-situ data were used to examine the temperature and salinity time series. Northward and eastward velocities were derived from ADCP data, which were recorded every other hour and at depth intervals of 4 or 8\u00a0m. Daily mean velocity data were vertically interpolated to intervals of 1\u00a0m, and their time series were examined.\n\n\n2.2\nShipborne conductivity\u2013temperature\u2013depth (CTD) data\nWe calculated the ocean heat content and the stratification index using hydrographic data obtained by the R\/V Mirai in the region of 72\u00b0\u201373\u00b0N, 155\u00b0\u2013160\u00b0W along the isobaths of 100\u20131000\u00a0m for 1999\u20132017 (Fig. 1b). Details of salinity calibration and performance of the CTD system that we used are described in Nishino et al. (2008). The number of shipborne CTD profiles is shown in Fig. 1c. The detail information of data collected by the CTD system can be found in the R\/V Mirai cruise report available at the JAMSTEC website (http:\/\/www.jamstec.go.jp\/iace\/e\/report\/).\n\n\n2.3\nWind data\nWe used the monthly 10-m wind dataset of the following reanalysis products: National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) (NCEP\u2013CFSR, Saha et al., 2010) and CFS Version 2 (NCEP\u2013CFSv2, Saha et al., 2014). These datasets were obtained from the Research Data Archive of National Center for Atmospheric Research (https:\/\/rda.ucar.edu\/). Spatial resolution of the data is 0.312\u00b0\u00d70.312\u00b0 (NCEP\u2013CFSR) and 0.205\u00b0\u00d70.204\u00b0 (NCEP\u2013CFSv2). Regional mean wind speeds in the northeastern Chukchi Sea between September and November in 2003, 2004, 2016, 2017, and 2018 were calculated (See details in Section 5.1). The wind stress curl in these years were calculated using the monthly momentum flux dataset of the same analysis products.\n\n\n\n3\nCharacteristics of the PSW on the Chukchi Sea northern slope\n\n3.1\nWater properties\nThe PSW was present at both Station HSN during Period 1 and Station NHC during Period 2. We constructed Temperature\u2013Salinity (T\u2013S) diagrams, and identified the PSW from the mooring data collected at Stations HSN\/NHC (Fig. 2\n). Since the PSW is a provider of ocean heat and a potential factor for sea ice melting in the Canada Basin, the temperature difference from the freezing point was adopted for definition. We referred to the water mass definition suggested by the previous studies (Corlett and Pickart., 2017; Li et al., 2019), and modified the lowest temperature based on the freezing point. Here, the water mass warmer than the freezing point +1\u00a0\u00b0C was defined as the PSW. The salinity range of the PSW followed the previous definition (i.e., 30.0\u201333.6). The PSW, defined above, in the water column of 10\u00a0m thickness has the ocean heat content (OHC) referenced to the freezing point, given by eq. (1), of >42.9\u00a0MJ\u00a0m\u22122, which has a potential to melt sea ice by\u00a0>\u00a014\u00a0cm. The OHC was calculated as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\nO\nH\nC\n\n(\nh\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\n\u2212\nh\n\n0\n\n\u03c1\n\n(\nz\n)\n\nC\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n\n{\n\nT\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n\u2212\n\nT\nf\n\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n\n}\n\nd\nz\n\n\n\nwhere h is the water depth. \u03c1 and C are the seawater density and the specific heat, respectively, which were calculated from the in-situ temperature, salinity, and pressure. T is the in-situ temperature, and T\n\nf\n is the freezing point. The PSW was warmer in Period 2 than in Period 1. For the salinity range of 31\u201333, the highest recorded temperature was 1.9\u00a0\u00b0C in Period 1, and 5.3\u00a0\u00b0C in Period 2 (i.e., 3.4\u00a0\u00b0C higher in Period 2 than in Period 1).\nThe vertical profiles of in-situ temperature and salinity from sea surface to 150\u00a0m are shown in Fig. 3\na. This shipborne hydrographic data were obtained by the R\/V Mirai cruises (See details in Section 2.2). We confirmed that the defined PSW existed mainly for the depth of 20\u201370\u00a0m (bold lines in Fig. 3a and b). The vertical profile of OHC ratio is shown in Fig. 3b. The value was calculated as follows:\n\n(2)\n\n\nO\nH\nC\n\nr\na\nt\ni\no\n\n\n(\n%\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\nO\nH\nC\n\n(\nh\n)\n\n\n\nO\nH\nC\n\n(\n150\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere h is the water depth. This ratio reached 50% until the depth of 30\u00a0m. However, the warm water in shallower than 30\u00a0m contained the Near Surface Temperature Maximum (NSTM), which was produced by summertime solar heating (Jackson et al., 2010). This warm NSTM water could be immediately cooled in late fall and early winter. In addition, the warm water below 150\u00a0m would have captured the warm saline Atlantic Water (AW) existing in the deeper layer in this region (Corlett and Pickart, 2017). Therefore, we focused on the PSW for the depth of 30\u2013150\u00a0m. In this study, the PSW was analyzed in the four layers based on the OHC ratio. We defined Layer 1 (30\u201360\u00a0m) as the PSW-core layer, which covers the ratio range of 50\u201370%. Layer 2 (Layer 3) was defined by the depth of 60\u201380\u00a0m (80\u2013100\u00a0m), which corresponds to the ratio range of 70\u201380% (80\u201385%). Layer 3 can be regarded as the deepest PSW layer, because Layer 4 defined by 100\u2013150\u00a0m is plausibly influenced by the warm saline Atlantic Water (AW).\nWater temperature at Stations HSN\/NHC varied on seasonal and interannual timescales (Fig. 4\na and b). We calculated the 14-day running mean from hourly or every other hourly in-situ mooring data to examine variability on timescales that are longer than one month. During both Periods 1 and 2, temperature reached maximum in fall\/winter every year (Fig. 4a and b). Colored sections of the lines in Fig. 4a\u2013d indicate the presence of the PSW at Stations HSN or NHC on the Chukchi Sea northern slope. The period covered by a colored section is referred to as the PSW-term in this study.\nThe PSW was present at Stations HSN\/NHC between July and March (Fig. 4). The highest temperature was recorded between September and December in Layers 1\u20132 (shallow layer) and between October and January in Layers 3\u20134 (deep layer). With the exception of 2017, temperature maximum appeared in the deep layer after it had appeared in the shallow layer. For example, onset of the PSW-term was earlier in Layers 1\u20132 than in Layer 3, with the exception of 2017 when onset was in July for all layers. Mooring data from between April and June showed temperatures near freezing, indicating presence of the cold MW and WW.\nAnalyses of salinity and CT sensor depth suggest that AW is unlikely to be the origin of the temperature maximum observed in fall. The first evidence is that salinity decreased around the time temperature peaked (Fig. 4c and d). For example, during the PSW-term in 2003, salinity decreased rapidly at the same time as rapid increase in temperature, suggesting that the temperature maximum in fall did not come from the warm and saline AW in the deep layer. In addition, the CT sensor maintained mostly constant depth, and strong currents rarely caused its depth to increase (Fig. 4e and f). This constant sensor depth and salinity decrease indicate that the temperature maximum was not caused by the AW.\nWe averaged temperature and salinity over the PSW-term (TPSW and SPSW, hereafter), and quantified the yearly change of the PSW properties on the Chukchi Sea northern slope (Fig. 5\n). TPSW and SPSW were calculated from the data obtained between April and March of the following year. For example, TPSW and SPSW in Year 04 (Fig. 5) were calculated from temperature and salinity data collected between April 2004 and March 2005. During Periods 1 and 2, TPSW was the lowest in Year 04 in Layers 1 and 3 and the highest in Year 17, while SPSW was the highest in Year 04. Although the mean CT sensor depth during the PSW-term was slightly different between the analysis periods (Table 2\n), this depth differences could not deny that the colder and saline PSW came to Station HSN in Year 04, and that the warmest water came to Station NHC in Year 17 (Fig. 4). Temperature and salinity time series in Fig. 4 indicate that the PSW was warmer and fresher in the shallow layer than in the deep layer at Stations HSN\/NHC. However, the lowest TPSW and highest SPSW of both Periods 1 and 2 were recorded in Year 04 despite the relatively shallower mean CT sensor depth, indicating that the PSW in Year 04 was cold and saline. In Year 17, although mean CT sensor depth was relatively deeper, TPSW was the highest of both Periods 1 and 2, indicating a high TPSW in Year 17. Comparisons between Periods 1 and 2 indicate that the PSW in the shallow layer was warmer and fresher during Period 2. For example, the PSW in Layer 1 was at 0.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0\u00b0C and 31.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 in Period 1, and 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00b0C and 31.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 in Period 2 on average. In Layer 2, the PSW was at \u22120.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0\u00b0C and 31.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 in Period 1, and 0.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0\u00b0C and 31.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 in Period 2 on average. The PSW in Layer 2 was warmer by 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C in Period 2 than in Period 1.\n\n\n3.2\nTime series of ocean velocity\nPrevious studies have suggested a northwestward flow on the Chukchi Sea northern slope (Corlett and Pickart, 2017; Watanabe et al., 2017). Using ADCP data from Periods 1 and 2 for the depth range of 30\u2013120\u00a0m, we estimated current direction at Stations HSN\/NHC to be 323\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00b0T and 308\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00b0T, respectively. These directions are almost the same as the orientation of the 90-m isobath (299.6\u00b0T) used in Corlett and Pickart (2017). In Fig. 6\n, positive velocity indicates flow in the direction of 299.6\u00b0T. A strong northwestward flow exceeding 30\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 appeared more frequently in Period 2 than in Period 1, implying that the CSC at Stations HSN\/NHC was stronger during Period 2.\nA southeastward flow was also recorded at Stations HSN\/NHC, and it appeared more frequently in Period 1 than in Period 2. This could be partially attributed to differences in ADCP depth and mooring location; the ADCP was at greater depth in Period 1 than in Period 2, and Station HSN in Period 1 was located on the inner shelf than Station NHC by approximately 20\u00a0km (Table 1). Therefore, the southeastward flow detected during Period 1 would have captured the bottom-intensified shelf-break jet, which has been observed on the shallower part of the slope (Spall et al., 2008; Corlett and Pickart, 2017).\nWe estimated current direction and speed during the PSW-term and Full-term (defined below) in each layer to address the pathway for the PSW coming to Stations HSN\/NHC. Direction and speed during the PSW-term were calculated using the ADCP data enclosed within the black rectangles in Fig. 6. Direction and speed during the Full-term were calculated using the ADCP data in each layer for each Period (1 or 2). Results show that current direction during the PSW-term and the Full-term was northwestward in all layers during both Periods 1 and 2 (Fig. 7\n). Current direction during the PSW-term (303\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023\u00b0T\u2013338\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058\u00b0T) was almost the same as that of the Full-term (306\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028\u00b0T\u2013325\u00a0\u00b1\u00a049\u00b0T).\nCurrent speed, which is represented by vector length in Fig. 7, was mostly low in the deep layer during both the PSW-term and the Full-term. For example, current speed during the PSW-term in Period 2 decreased from 20.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.9\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 in Layer 1 to 14.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.1\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 in Layer 3 (Fig. 7). Speed during the PSW-term was higher than that during the Full-term. For example, in Layer 1 and Period 1, the PSW-term (Full-term) speed was 15.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.0\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 (9.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121). Speeds during the PSW-term in Layers 2 in Period 1 were also higher than those in the Full-term. In Layer 1, current speed during the PSW-term was higher than that during the Full-term by 6.1\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 (Period 1) and 5.1\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 (Period 2). These results show that the northward flow at Stations HSN\/NHC was intensified in the shallow layer and during the PSW-term. Moreover, the northwestward flow was strong in Period 2. Current speed during the Full-term was 4.4\u20136.5\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 higher in Period 2 than in Period 1, while that during the PSW-term was also 2.5\u20136.3\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 higher in Period 2. The difference of the velocity statistically indicated.\n\n\n\n4\nRelationship between the PSW properties on the Chukchi Sea northern slope and in Barrow Canyon\nCurrent direction on the Chukchi Sea northern slope was mainly northwestward; therefore, we hypothesized that the PSW on the northern slope originated from Barrow Canyon or the southern edge of the Beaufort Gyre in the Canada Basin. To test this hypothesis, we compared hydrographic properties of the PSW in Barrow Canyon with properties of the PSW on the Chukchi Sea northern slope in the following subsections.\n\n4.1\nTime series in Barrow Canyon\nTime series of temperature, salinity, and depth were recorded at Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E in Barrow Canyon (Figs. 8\u201310\n\n\n). Frequent deepening in CT sensor depth occurred only at Station BC-C, probably as a result of the deep seafloor (cf. Table 1) and strong current at this location (Itoh et al., 2013). In Layer 1, the PSW passed through Barrow Canyon between June and December. Compared with Stations HSN\/NHC, PSW-term onset was a month earlier in Barrow Canyon (Fig. 8a\u2013d, 9a\u2013d, and 10a\u2013d), indicating that the PSW on the northern slope could have been transported from Barrow Canyon. Therefore, we conducted a lag correlation analysis to examine the origin of the PSW observed at Stations HSN\/NHC.\n\n\n4.2\nLag correlation analysis\nA lag correlation analysis was applied between the temperature time series at Stations HSN\/NHC and those at Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E. The time series at the Barrow Canyon stations was shifted for the range of \u221250\u2013100 days. Table 3\n shows the lag (in days) corresponding to maxima in correlation coefficients. For example, in Period 1 and Layer 1, temperature peak at Station HSN was delayed by 11 days from the timing of the temperature peak at Station BC-W, and the correlation coefficient was 0.86 (Table 3). Lags in Year 03 were calculated using 6-months record because of limited data availability while lags in all other years were calculated using one year record. In Layer 1, correlation coefficients for Station BC-W were 0.84\u20130.97 (Table 3). There is little difference between the correlation coefficients of the three stations in Barrow Canyon. This highly positive correlation supports the hypothesis that the PSW on the northern slope originates from Barrow Canyon. Lags corresponding to maxima in correlation coefficients were 7\u201361 days in Layer 1, and varied between stations. Lag at Station BC-E was the longest. For example, in Period 2 and Layer 1, whereas lags at Stations BC-W\/BC-C were 14 and 17 days, respectively, the lag at Station BC-E was 32 days. Previous studies have revealed that a substantial part of the Pacific-origin water flows eastward along the Alaskan coast and turns westward on the Beaufort shelf (Corlett and Pickart, 2017; Watanabe et al., 2017; Stabeno et al., 2018). The long lags at Station BC-E suggest that the PSW passing through eastern Barrow Canyon could take this route. Temperature time series in Layer 3 were also positively correlated with coefficients of 0.39\u20130.92 (Table 3). The long lag at Station BC-E was repeated in Layer 3. Lags in Layer 3 were longer than those in Layer 1. In Year 16 and Layer 1, the temperature peaks at Stations BC-W\/BC-C lagged behind that at Station NHC (i.e., negative lag days). This unique feature will be discussed in Section 5.2.\nVelocity of PSW transport was calculated on the basis of the lag correlation analysis and the distance between the Barrow Canyon stations (Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E) and the Chukchi Sea northern slope stations (Stations HSN\/NHC), which was 240\u00a0km. The velocity was 4.6\u201339.7\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 in Layer 1 and 3.2\u201334.7\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121 in Layer 3. These values are comparable with the CSC velocities reported in previous studies (Li et al., 2019; Watanabe et al., 2017), and is in the same order as ADCP velocities observed at Stations HSN\/NHC (Section 3.2).\n\n\n4.3\nChanges in PSW properties\nTo quantify changes in the properties of the PSW during transport from Barrow Canyon to Stations HSN\/NHC, we compared the TPSW and SPSW values between the Barrow Canyon stations and the Chukchi Sea northern slope stations. At Stations BC-W\/BC-C, the yearly variation of TPSW was similar to that at Stations HSN\/NHC (Figs. 5 and 11\n). TPSW was low in Year 04 and high in Year 17 (Fig. 11a, c). TPSW at Station BC-E was higher than that at Station BC-W and that at Station BC-C by 0.2\u20132.0\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 11a, c, e). SPSW was high in Year 04 in Layer 1 (Fig. 11b, d, f). We analyzed changes in PSW properties in Layers 1 and 3 during transport from Barrow Canyon to the northern slope for each analysis period, and found that TPSW and SPSW mostly decreased between Barrow Canyon and the northern slope. Negative values in Fig. 12\n indicate that TPSW and SPSW decreased from Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E to Stations HSN\/NHC. In Layer 1, the temperature change (\u0394TPSW) was mostly negative. Positive \u0394TPSW in Year 03 is probably a result of overestimation. In this year, it is plausible that we could not capture the temperature peak in Barrow Canyon before mooring deployment. Therefore, it was suggested that the PSW temperature in Barrow Canyon in Year 03 might be much lower than the potential average, and that the \u0394Tpsw was positively overestimated. On average, \u0394TPSW was negatively higher in Period 2 than in Period 1. In Layer 3, \u0394TPSW was also mostly negative, and the highest absolute value was found in Year 17. Absolute value of \u0394TPSW at Station BC-E was higher than the absolute values of \u0394TPSW at Stations BC-W\/BC-C. The salinity change (\u0394SPSW) was also mostly negative in Layer 1. Negative \u0394SPSW in Year 03 was caused by the absence of a temperature peak which accompanied with low salinity in Barrow Canyon. Positive \u0394SPSW in Layer 1 in Year 18 was caused by high salinity on the northern slope (cf. Fig. 5). \u0394SPSW were negative in Years 16 and 17 in Period 2. In Layer 3, there was little variation in \u0394SPSW between Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E.\nHere, we present a brief summary of our analysis results. The temperature time series at Stations HSN\/NHC were strongly correlated with those at Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E (Table 3). This result supports the hypothesis that the PSW on the Chukchi Sea northern slope was transported from Barrow Canyon. The lag correlation analysis indicated that the advection timescale for this transport ranged from a week to several months. Moreover, it was found that the TPSW and SPSW mostly decreased after the transport. This temperature and salinity decreases were larger in Period 2 than Period 1 especially in Layer 1. The potential factors controlling these changes are discussed in Section 5.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussions\n\n5.1\nRelationship between TPSW and vertical mixing\nVertical mixing with surface cold water is a potential factor for TPSW decrease between Barrow Canyon and the Chukchi Sea northern slope. The mixing ratio between the PSW and sea ice meltwater was estimated using the T\u2013S diagram (Fig. 13\n). The temperature and salinity at the point where the line connecting the values at Stations HSN\/NHC (T\n\nHN\n, S\n\nHN\n) and Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E (T\n\nBC,\nS\n\nBC\n) intersected the freezing point line was regarded as the meltwater property (T\n\nMW\n, S\n\nMW\n) in this analysis. Then, we calculated the mixing ratio from the temperature as follows:\n\n(3)\n\n\nm\ni\nx\ni\nn\ng\n\nr\na\nt\ni\no\n\n\n(\n%\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nT\n\nB\nC\n\n\n\u2212\n\nT\n\nH\nN\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\nB\nC\n\n\n\u2212\n\nT\n\nM\nW\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n\n\n\n\n\nIf T\n\nHN\n is equal to T\n\nBC\n, we used salinity. The mixing ratio was mostly positive and higher than 20% in Years 16, 17, and 18. In Year 04, although the mixing ratio of \u221215.1\u00a0at Station BC-W was unrealistic, the values at Stations BC-C and BC-E were positive (i.e., 17.6 and 49.5). These results indicated that the PSW at Stations HSN\/NHC was influenced by the mixing with sea ice meltwater. Regarding in Year 03, the S\n\nMW\n was negative (not shown) when we used the temperature and salinity at Stations BC-W\/BC-C, and higher than 32 when we used the values at Station BC-E. The warmest PSW in Year 03 passed through Barrow Canyon before mooring deployment. Therefore, the TPSW in Barrow Canyon was lower than the potential average, and the unrealistic S\n\nMW\n could be produced by this calculation. If the mooring was deployed before the potential peak, the ratio in year 03 was maybe more credible because the S\n\nMW\n could be realistic.\nGenerally, mixing could be enhanced by a combination of weak stratification and strong wind. Therefore, we estimated the stratification index (SI) in September and\/or October and the wind speed for September\u2013November in the slope region. Following the method of Ladd and Stabeno (2012), SI for the depth range of 0\u201330\u00a0m was calculated as follows:\n\n(4)\n\nS\nI\n=\n\n\u2212\n\n\u222b\n\n\u2212\nh\n\n0\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\nz\n\n\u2212\n\n<\n\u03c1\n>\n\n\ng\nz\n\nd\nz\n;\n\n<\n\u03c1\n>\n\n=\n\n1\nh\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\u2212\nh\n\n0\n\n\u03c1\n\nz\n\n\nd\nz\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n is the seawater density, and \n\nh\n\n is the depth, which was set to 30\u00a0m in this study. The SI was calculated using the same shipborne CTD data as the OHC (See details in Section 2.2). Between 1999 and 2019, average SI in September and\/or October of each year was approximately 1000\u20133000\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122 (Fig. 14\na). Note that there was no R\/V Mirai cruise in 2003, and the CTD data were not obtained in this region in 2018. Therefore, the SI cannot be calculated in these years. These values are comparable to those in the eastern Bering Sea, which were reported by Ladd and Stabeno (2012) and Ueno et al. (2020). The SI varied interannually (e.g., high in 2002 and 2004 and low in 2015 and 2017) and was higher in Period 1 than in Period 2 (Fig. 14a). We confirmed that the SI did not depend on the seafloor depth (Fig. 14b). For each analysis period, the SI was related to TPSW decrease; \u0394TPSW tended to be negative during the years with weak stratification (Fig. 15\na, c). Negative \u0394TPSW with lower absolute values appear to be associated with higher SI values. The \u0394TPSW in Layer 1\u00a0at Station BC-C in 2016 and that at Station BC-E in 2004 diverge from this tendency, and may be explained by other factors. In 2016, \u0394TPSW at Station BC-C was negative; its absolute value was higher than that expected from the SI (Fig. 15a). Potential factors for this issue were addressed in Section 5.2. In 2004, the lag in Layer 1\u00a0at Station BC-E (Table 3) was extremely long (61 days), and was longer than the lags at other stations. The long transport time suggests large heat losses along the route from Station BC-E to Station HSN, resulting in the negative \u0394TPSW shown in Fig. 15a.\nWe also examined the relationship between wind speed and PSW temperature decrease on the Chukchi Sea northern slope. The CFSR\/CFSv2 wind speed data at 10\u00a0m height for September\u2013November were averaged over a rectangular region with Station NHC (73.3\u00b0N, 160.8\u00b0W) at the northwestern corner and Station BC-E (71.7\u00b0N, 155.0\u00b0W) at the southeastern corner (Fig. 1b). The mean wind speed ranged between 3.5 and 4.5\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121, and showed no clear relationship with \u0394TPSW (Fig. 15b, d). For example, although the spatially and temporarily averaged wind speed for September\u2013November was 3.7\u20133.8\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 in both 2016 and 2017, \u0394TPSW was negative in both years with its absolute value that was higher in 2017 than in 2016. Wind speed was the highest in 2004, though the absolute value of temperature decrease was not especially high in that year. This result suggests that surface wind did not account for \u0394TPSW difference in Years 16 and 17.\nWe estimated the vertical shear of ocean current. Since the ADCP data for the depth of 0\u201330\u00a0m was not available in Period 1 (Fig. 6a), the subsurface vertical shear for September\u2013November was estimated using the horizontal velocity at the depths of 35\u00a0m and 45\u00a0m. The vertical shear in Period 2 was significantly larger than in Period 1 (Table 4\n). This result might support more vertical mixing with surface cold water in Period 2 than in Period 1. This fact was consistent with negatively higher \u0394TPSW in Period 2. While the wind conditions were not consistent with the strength of the mixing between the PSW and sea ice meltwater as described above, the stratification index and the subsurface vertical shear supported strong mixing in Period 2 than Period 1.\nRegarding the vertical mixing, convection is rarely caused by surface cooling in this region because the stratification strongly depends on salinity. Although salinity is influenced by the other factors such as sea ice formation, the salinity change would not be enough to cause convection. For example, even when sea ice of 1-m thickness with its salinity of 5 formed in a seawater column of 10\u00a0m with salinity of 28, the salinity of remnant seawater increases from 28 to 30.5. This value is lower than the salinity in Layer 1 (Fig. 3).\n\n\n5.2\nThe PSW transport in year 16\nThe lag correlation analysis of the temperature time series between Station NHC and the Barrow Canyon stations of BC-W\/BC-C showed the negative lag days for the maximum correlation in Layer 1 in Year 16 (Section 4.2, Table 3). This result cannot be explained by simple transport from Barrow Canyon. We compared the temperature time series in Layer 1 between Station NHC and the Barrow Canyon stations (Fig. 16\na\u2013c). The earlier temperature peak at Station NHC than at Station BC-W did not account for the westward PSW transport between the two regions. The almost simultaneous peaks at Station NHC and BC-C also indicated other PSW pathways. On the other hand, distinct double peaks of temperature appeared at Station BC-E (Fig. 16c). The first (second) peak was detected in late August (early October). The lag between the first peak at Station BC-E and the single peak at Station NHC was 44 days, which was consistent with the result in other years (Fig. 16c). The relatively weak gradient (i.e., upward convex) of the lag correlation coefficient around 44 days was also confirmed (Fig. 16f). Therefore, it seems reasonable that the single peak at Station NHC was mainly associated with the first peak at Station BC-E in Year 16. On the other hand, the positive lag (i.e., 7 days) in Table 3 between the time series at Station BC-E and at Station NHC was attributed to the second peak at Station BC-E. While the second peak could also contribute to the appearance of the peak at Station NHC, most part of the second peak would have been transported toward another region and\/or layer. We propose two potential scenarios on this issue: 1) The PSW was transported into the Canada Basin by mesoscale eddies, or 2) the PSW shifted to the deeper layer during westward advection.\n\n5.2.1\nTransport by mesoscale eddies\n\nKimura et al. (2019) reported the distinct PSW signal at Station NBC (72.47\u00b0N, 155.41\u00b0W), which was located north of Barrow Canyon, in the winter of Year 16. Previous modeling studies also indicated that mesoscale eddies sometimes transported the PSW into the southern Canada Basin, especially under less sea ice and\/or westerly wind conditions (Watanabe and Hasumi, 2009; Watanabe, 2011). The sea ice\u2013ocean model experiment for 2001\u20132019 by a co-author (E. Watanabe) indicated that total volume of mesoscale eddies generated from Barrow Canyon was largest in Year 16 (this result will be submitted as another publication). Therefore, the PSW producing the single temperature peak at Station BC-W\/BC-C, and the second peak at Station BC-E could have been transported toward the basin by mesoscale eddies, which would have been notably active in Year 16.\n\n\n5.2.2\nPSW shift to the deeper layer\nWe examined the second scenario by conducting another lag correlation analysis, where the temperature time series at Stations HSN\/NHC in Layer 1 were replaced with those in Layer 2. The time series in Layer 2\u00a0at Stations HSN\/NHC showed high correlations with those in Layer 1\u00a0at Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E (Table 3). This result implies the downward PSW shift to Layer 2 during lateral advection from Barrow Canyon to Stations HSN\/NHC. The maxima in the correlation coefficient in Year 16 were 0.04\u20130.11 higher than those calculated between the Barrow Canyon stations and the Chukchi Sea northern slope stations in Layer 1. Therefore, the downward PSW shift to Layer 2 might be intensified especially in Year 16, though the PSW shift occurred in the other years.\nHere the Ekman pumping was estimated from the wind stress curl in the slope region defined in Fig. 1b. The Ekman downwelling of 10.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0cm day\u22121 was consistent with the PSW deepening in Year 16. On the other hand, although the Ekman upwelling of 13.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8\u00a0cm day\u22121 occurred in Year 17, the lag correlation coefficient between the temperature time series in Layer 2\u00a0at Stations HSN\/NHC and those in Layer 1\u00a0at Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E was also high in Year 17 (Table 3). These minor Ekman upwelling\/downwelling indicated that the wind stress curl did not completely support the PSW shift to the deeper layers. Therefore, the second scenario was not sufficient to explain the negative lag days in Year 16. It is more plausible that the substantial part of the PSW passing thorough the Barrow Canyon stations was directly transported to the Canada Basin by mesoscale eddies in Year 16 (i.e., the first scenario).\n\n\n\n5.3\nCT sensor depth\nIn this study, the CT sensor depth (e.g., Table 1) was used as the mean PSW depth during the PSW-term although there were slight differences in sensor depth among moorings. For example, the CT sensor depth in Layer 1 was 55\u00a0m (35\u00a0m) for the NHC15 (NHC16) mooring (Table 1). Therefore, the impact of differences in CT sensor depth on the observed temperature and salinity changes is briefly examined in this subsection. The shipborne CTD data obtained at the time of NHC16 deployment indicated average temperature and salinity values of \u22120.1\u00a0\u00b0C and 30.7 for the depth range of 30\u201340\u00a0m and of \u22120.9\u00a0\u00b0C and 31.8 for the depth range of 50\u201360\u00a0m. Between the two depth ranges, the temperature and salinity differences were 0.8\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.1, respectively. Both depth ranges lie within Layer 1, and the temperature and salinity differences between these depth ranges were larger than the temperature and salinity changes recorded between the Chukchi Sea northern slope stations and the Barrow Canyon stations. Vertical temperature and salinity differences related to the PSW thickness and depth should be taken into consideration in future studies.\n\n\n5.4\nPotential biases related to mooring locations\nThe difference in the mooring locations of Stations HSN\/NHC is considered to understand potential biases of the vertical mixing analysis. As described in Sections 2.1 and 3.2, Station HSN was located on the inner shelf than Station NHC by approximately 20\u00a0km. Since the mooring at Station HSN might not capture the main axis of the Chukchi Slope Current, compared with Station NHC (cf. Boury et al., 2020), the analyzed weaker vertical shear in Period 1 (Table 4) could be caused by the location difference in addition to interannual variability. However, the smaller mixing ratio in Period 1 than that in Period 2 was estimated by our analysis (Fig. 13). If Station HSN was located on the main axis of the slope current, the higher temperature there (Fig. 5) and less cooling (Fig. 12) would have appeared in Period 1. Those information still supported the stronger vertical mixing in Period 2 than in Period 1. The long-term comparison between Stations HSN\/NHC is needed to plainly understand the more detail differences of hydrographic properties across the shelf slope.\n\n\n\n6\nSummary\nWe investigated the PSW transport along the Chukchi Sea northern slope. Based on mooring observations, we found that the PSW was present at Stations HSN\/NHC between summer and winter (from July to March). The PSW was warmer and fresher in Period 2 (2015\u20132019) than in Period 1 (2003\u20132005). According to the lag correlation analysis of the temperature time series, temperature variations at Stations HSN\/NHC were highly correlated with those at the three stations in Barrow Canyon. This result indicates that the PSW at Stations HSN\/NHC originated from Barrow Canyon. Temperature in the layer of 30\u201360\u00a0m peaked at Stations HSN\/NHC 7\u201361 days after its peak in Barrow Canyon. The lag at Station BC-E was longer than the lags at Stations BC-W\/BC-C.\nWe also found that the temperature and salinity averaged over the PSW-term declined during the transport from the Barrow Canyon stations (Stations BC-W\/BC-C\/BC-E) to the Chukchi Sea northern slope stations (Stations HSN\/NHC). The temperature decrease was enhanced in Period 2 in Layer 1 (30\u201360\u00a0m), and the salinity decrease was enhanced in Years 16 and 17 in Layer 1. The enhanced PSW cooling would be caused by stronger vertical mixing accompanied by weak stratification. This PSW cooling implied that PSW heat loss on the Chukchi Sea northern slope was larger in Period 2 than in Period 1. The result indicates that the heat loss between the two regions is not ignorable. Therefore, quantification of the heat loss with continuous observation on the CSC route is needed to improve our understanding of the heat transport from the Chukchi shelf to the Canada Basin through PSW advection.\n\n","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"","107":"","108":"","109":"","110":"","111":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Arctic is warming faster than most of the world, and the current pace of change is unprecedented in recorded history. Rates of warming, sea ice loss, glacier and permafrost melt are higher than humans have ever observed, and some of these changes are likely irreversible (Lenton et al., 2019). The regional impacts of what is called Arctic amplification (AA, Serreze and Francis, 2006) are severe. Additionally, AA may lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of mid-latitude weather extremes through changes in atmospheric circulation patterns (Serreze and Barry 2011; Cohen et al., 2014), partly caused by a reduced equator-pole temperature gradient (Francis et al., 2017). Consequently, AA will have economic and societal impacts across much of the Northern Hemisphere. However, there is still uncertainty about the nature of the influence of AA on lower latitudes (Cohen et al., 2020), because of a lack of detailed data on long-term Arctic climate and environmental change (Bekryaev et al., 2010; Pisaric et al., 2011).\nTree rings, ice cores and laminated sediments, can extend our knowledge of climate back in time, and have played important roles in the understanding of regional to hemispheric climate variability in the past two millennia (PAGES 2k Consortium 2019; Neukom et al., 2019). Despite the emergence of several proxy-based reconstructions of Arctic temperature and hydroclimate (Overpeck et al., 1997; Kaufman et al., 2009; McKay and Kaufman 2014; Nicolle et al., 2018), and sea ice changes (Kinnard et al., 2011), over the past centuries to millennia, the distribution of proxies is heterogeneous, with many regions severely underrepresented (B\u00fcntgen et al., 2014; Linderholm et al., 2018).\nRivers in northern North America and Eurasia draining into the Arctic Ocean not only carry huge quantities of depleted organic matter (Opsahl et al., 1999), but also wood from the boreal forests (e.g. Eggertsson 1994; Hellmann et al., 2017). Driftwood (DW) originates from the boreal zone and is released into the Arctic Ocean, either through river bank erosion, mainly in spring during river breakup (Dyke et al., 1997), or from logs lost during river drives (e.g. Hellman et al., 2015; 2016a, 2017), and is frequently washed up and deposited on Arctic shores. Trees entering the Arctic Ocean cannot stay afloat long; it has been estimated that conifers can stay afloat for about 10\u201317 months (6\u201310 months for deciduous trees), where the buoyancy depends mainly on size and degree of desiccation (H\u00e4ggblom 1982). Because the passage across the Arctic Ocean takes several years, DW needs to be incorporated in sea ice in order to reach deep into the Arctic (e.g. Dyke et al., 1997).\nMorphological features and microscopic wood anatomy analyses are used to determine which genus, or even species, a DW sample belongs to (Hellman et al., 2013). This information enables a rough (e.g. continental scale) identification of where a tree originally grew. By adding dendrochronological techniques, it is possible to reconstruct when, as well as where, it grew with quite high geographical precision, often at catchment level (see Hellman et al., 2017). Moreover, a firmly dated DW sample with known origin indicates that sea ice was present to transport it sometime after its death, but it can also provide some information of the currents transporting it (Bennike 2004; Hole and Macias-Fauria 2017). Changes in driftwood, origin and\/or abundance, may therefore offer unique insights into past changes in Arctic Ocean sea ice and current dynamics (Dyke et al., 1997). Additionally, tree-ring data derived from Arctic DW contain high-resolution climate information representing the location where the trees grew (St George 2014; Hellmann et al., 2016b), and since large parts of the northern boreal region in Eurasia and North America lack long paleoclimate records (PAGES 2k Consortium 2017), increasing the number of datasets is of high importance.\nMost DW found at or close to the present Arctic shorelines, dates to the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and in most cases shows signs of logging (e.g. Hellmann et al., 2013). Older DW can be found on raised beeches, or buried in sediments above the present sea level (H\u00e4ggblom 1982; Bennike 2004; Funder et al., 2011; Hole and Macias-Fauria 2017). Previously. 14C-dated DW has been used to infer past sea-ice conditions (Bennike 2004; Moros et al., 2006; Polyak et al., 2010; Funder), changes in Arctic Ocean currents (Giddings 1952; Eggertsson 1994; Dyke et al., 1997; Dyke and Savelle 2000), and postglacial rebound (Salvigsen 1981; Salvigsen and Mangerud 1991; Bondevik et al., 1995). However, few studies have explored the potential of employing dendrochronological methods on DW tree-ring data.\nDW from Svalbard has been described and studied for more than a century. In 1869, the Swedish botanist Jacob Georg Agardh, wrote about DW collected during Swedish expeditions to Svalbard (Agardh 1869). He concluded that DW consisted of conifers, mainly larch and spruce, and that it came from northern Siberia (based partly on the general widths of the rings in the DW). Analysing DW material collected on the Swedish polar expeditions in the late 1890s, lngvarson (1903) divided the DW into two categories, those transported with the \u201cPolar current\u201d from northern Siberia, and those transported with the Gulf stream (consisting of both American and Norwegian material). The most common DW from Svalbard was Larix sibirica, but some Larix americana was found on the northernmost parts of Svalbard. Salvigsen (1981) investigated raised beaches on Svensk\u00f8ya and Kongs\u00f8ya in the eastern Svalbard archipelago, and found DW on different elevations up to 100\u00a0m a.s.l., where the oldest samples dated to the early Holocene (ca. 9\u201310 000 years BP). In addition to the old DW, consisting mainly of Larix sp. and Picea sp., where a few of the latter were identified as Picea mariana, consequently having originated from North America. Investigating shoreline displacement on Agardhbukta, eastern Spitsbergen, Salvigsen and Mangerud (1991) found a \u201clog-level\u201d, comprising Larix sp. and Picea sp., corresponding to ca. 6500 BP. One Pinus sylvestris sample was found closer to sea level, dated to ca. 800 BP. Combining DW samples from Isfjorden, western Spitsbergen, collected by Bartholin and Hjort (1987), and Widefjorden, northern Svalbard, Eggertsson (1984) presented a detailed dendrochronological study. The DW were collected from present shores, and Pinus sp. was most abundant at both sites, followed by Picea sp., while Larix was in principle only found at the northern site. Moreover, based on the ring-with patterns of the trees, which all had their end dates in the twentieth century, the provenances of the DW were inferred; Pinus came from the While Sea region and central Siberia, Picea from the While Sea region and Larix likely from eastern Siberia. Data from northwestern Svalbard were later included in a study where almost 1500 DW samples from the North Atlantic\/Arctic Ocean sector were analysed in detail (Hellman et al. 2013, 2015, 2016a, 2017), again mainly focusing on material from present-day beaches.\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the potential of using DW from hitherto unexplored locations on Svalbard, to extend existing pan-Arctic tree-ring chronologies back in time, and thus further our knowledge of regional climate variations in the past. To achieve this, DW was sampled from Kongs\u00f8ya in the easternmost part of the Svalbard archipelago and the southwestern coast of Spitsbergen. Using dendrochronological methods, we attempted to date and the provenance the collected material. Based on our results, we discussed the major sources of DW on Svalbard, issues related to its dating, as well as the potential of DW as a proxy for Arctic sea-ice variations.\n\n\n2\nMaterial and methods\n\n2.1\nDriftwood\nThe Icebound expedition sailed around Svalbard in 2014 with the aim to collect information about Arctic climate in a historical perspective. Sampling sites included Kongs\u00f8ya, in the easternmost part of the Svalbard islands, and the southwestern coast of Spitsbergen (Fig. 1\n). Kongs\u00f8ya is the main island in the Kong Karls Land group of islands. This uninhabited island belongs to the Nordaust-Svalbard nature reserve, and since 1985 landing on the island without permission is forbidden. For the dendrochronological part of the project, 380 driftwood samples were collected from seven locations along the expedition route. Samples of DW were mainly collected from material found on the present beaches, where it was most abundant, but additional material was also sampled further inland, often partially buried, and at higher elevations, such as raised beaches (Fig. 2\n). The strategy was to sample all DW found in the investigated areas, but severely decayed DW or very small tree remains with few visible annual rings was avoided, because of the difficulties when processing the annual rings. Using a chainsaw, discs were taken from each DW sample. The positions (latitude-longitude, elevation) and special characteristics (e.g. cutting marks) of each DW were noted, the discs labelled and put in plastic bags. The DW found lying on the ground are often dry and light due to long aerial exposure, and easy to handle. The DW found embedded in sediments were wet and more fragile, having to be handled with care. Details of the samples from each site are given in Table 1\n.\n\n\n2.2\nSpecies identification\nFirst, macroscopic classification of the key characteristics of the wood was made to identify if the individual samples belonged to hardwoods (deciduous) or softwoods (conifers). The surfaces of cross sections of all samples were prepared, where the dry wood (majority) was sanded and the wet (buried) wood cut with a scalpel. Contrary to conifers, large pores (vessels) and faint\/diffuse transitions between early- and latewood characterises deciduous wood. Thus, it was possible to divide the two types of wood. Given that the vast majority of the samples were conifers, macroscopic features were used to subdivide these into genera: Pinus, Picea, Larix and Abies. A detailed identification, where in some cases also the species could be determined, was then made microscopically, using the identification keys described by Hellmann et al. (2013). Radial sections were cut for all samples using a microtone and unstained thin sections were investigated under a microscope. The identification of the respective genera and species is related to some uncertainty, but with a careful combination of macro- and microscopic techniques, most samples were successfully determined.\n\n\n2.3\nTree-ring analysis\nThe widths of the annual rings were measured with a precision of 1\/100\u00a0mm on a Lintab measuring device connected to the software TSAPwin (Rinntech, Heidelberg, Germany). At least two radii were measured from each sample, and the tree-ring patterns compared against each other to ensure that all rings were accounted for, a process known as crossdating (Fritts 1967). Then the radii were averaged into a series representing each tree. Similar to earlier Svalbard DW studies (Eggertsson 1994; Hellmann et al., 2017), we focused on the most abundant species, Pinus, Picea and Larix. When all samples of a specific genus had been measured, all series were crossdated against each other building up undated (floating) chronologies of samples that showed agreement based on statistical measures, including t-test values (Baillie and Pilcher 1973)\u00a0\u2265\u00a04.0 and significant \u201cGleichl\u00e4ufigkeit\" scores (which indicates how well two samples match when overlapping). Additionally, all series agreements were visually controlled. To date and provenance the obtained DW chronologies, they were compared to a set of reference chronologies from trees growing in the watersheds of the major rivers entering the Arctic Ocean from where the DW was expected to have originated from (Table 2\n). Samples that could not be included in any chronology (e.g. because of limited overlap between samples from a region) were compared directly with the reference chronologies. The reference chronologies represented Dvina-Pechora, Yenisei, Ob and Lena in Eurasia (Hellman et al., 2015), and Yukon and Mackenzie in North America (Hellman et al., 2017). The dendro-provenancing (Bonde et al., 1997) followed the same procedure as the crossdating of the individual samples. The chronologies (see below) containing 10 or more overlapping tree ring-width series were further processed. The age trends, which most tree-ring series contain, were removed to obtain chronologies representing the common growth characteristics for a set of DW samples using the ARSTAN software (Cook and Krusic 2007).\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nComposition of the driftwood\nOf the 380 DW samples collected from Svalbard, five coniferous and four deciduous genera were identified (Table 3\n). Pinus sp. made up half of the sampled material, with a domination of Pinus sylvestris L. (PISY) whereas Picea sp. (PCSP) and Larix sp. (LASP) and Abies sp. (ABSP) roughly constitute the other half (46%). Only 12 deciduous wood samples were found, including Salix sp., Populus sp., Betula sp. and Acer sp., and together they constituted less than 4% of the total sampled material (Table 3). The genus of two samples could not be determined.\n\n\n3.2\nDating and provenance of the driftwood\nWe focused on PCSP, LASP and PISY, for which suitable reference chronologies were available. These were also by far most abundant, making up 87% of all collected DW.\n\n3.2.1\nPicea sp. (PCSP)\nThe 80 PCSP samples made up about one fifth of the total DW, and were found at all seven locations (Table 3). However, the highest percentages were found in Bellsund (Calypsobyen and Reinsletta) where PCSP made up ca 30% of all DW, and at the other sites it contributed to the total with around 10\u201320% (Fig. 3\n). The lengths of the samples spanned from 27 to 201 years, with an average of 97 rings. In total, 50 PCSP DW samples could be dated and the provenance determined, although nine were uncertain. Most PCSP started growing (based on the innermost tree ring) during the nineteenth century (24), followed by the eighteenth (15) and twentieth (5) centuries. The dating of the PCSP with first rings in the seventeenth to eleventh centuries (one for each century except the fourteenth) are quite uncertain. Almost 90% of the last rings, indicating the earliest possible death year, were dated to the twentieth (31) and nineteenth (13) centuries.\nMost PCSP DW (31) came from the Dvina-Pechora river system, 10 from Yenisei, 5 from Lena and 3 from Ob. Based on our dating and provenance criteria, five samples were found to originate from North America: three from the Yukon River region of Alaska (GHPA067: 1127\u20131205 CE, GHPA068: 1699\u20131781 CE and KA018: 1850\u20131924 CE), and two from the Mackenzie River region in Canada (CBPA007: 1510\u20131629 CE and TNPA008: 1779\u20131860 CE). Of the spruces originating from Dvina-Pechora, 26 were successfully combined into a chronology spanning 1705\u20131988 CE (Fig. 4\na). Because of the low replication, the chronology is not very reliable in its early parts. There is a clear peak around 1900 in the replication. The majority of samples making up the chronology came from Calypsobyen (Fig. 4e).\n\n\n3.2.2\nLarix sp. (LASP)\nIn total LASP made up 22% of all DW (Table 3). The majority of LASP samples were found on Kongs\u00f8ya and in Hornsund, twice as much as was found in Dunderdalen and Bellsund (Fig. 3). Of the 84 LASP samples collected, 80 samples were measured, with the number of rings spanning from 29 to 285, and an average of 137 rings. Only 27 samples could be dated and the provenance determined. Most of the dated LASP started growing in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (37% each). One tree started growing in the twelfth and one in the fourteenth century, both originating from Dvina-Pechora. Only one tree started growing in the twentieth century. Seventy four percent (20 trees) of the outermost rings dated to the twentieth century, where most (16) end years were before 1970. One tree ended in the eighteenth century and four in the nineteenth century. The outermost rings of the two oldest trees dated to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\nOf the dated samples, 19 LASP from Yenisei (the remaining 8 came from Dvina-Pechora) were compiled into a chronology spanning the period 1671 to 1988 CE (Fig. 4b). Given the low number of samples, the representation of the chronology for the Larix sp. population in the Yenisei region is quite limited, except for the mid-1800s where most trees coexisted. The chronology was mainly made up of LASP from Hornsund, especially G\u00e5shamna, with only few samples from Kongs\u00f8ya (Fig. 4e), from where a large number of samples could not be dated. The high amount of undated LASP at Kongs\u00f8ya is likely due to most DW having been collected from elevations of 20\u201330\u00a0m a.s.l., corresponding to beaches of much older dates than the reference chronologies (see further discussion below).\n\n\n3.2.3\nPinus sylvestris (PISY)\nPISY was the most commonly found DW species and found at all seven locations (Table 3). PISY made up 50\u201365% of the sampled DW at most low-level sites (G\u00e5shamna, Calypsobyen, Hansbreen and T\u00f8mmerneset beach), around 40% at Dunderdalen, but only between 8 and 15% at the higher elevation sites (Kap Andreassen, Vrakbukta and T\u00f8mmerneset) (Fig. 3). Of the 165 PISY samples collected, 151 could be dated and the provenance determined. The lengths of the samples spanned from 29 to 368 years, with an average of 138 rings. Of the dated Scots pines, 47% (71) had their innermost rings in the nineteenth century, 36% (55) in the eighteenth century, 7% each (11) in the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries, and c. 1% (2) in the fifteenth century. Only one tree started growing in the twentieth century. Seventy five percent (113) of the outermost rings dated to the twentieth century. Because the vast majority displayed signs of having been cut or sawed (only five did not), it is clear that most trees had been harvested. The majority of the twentieth century pines (81) were felled before 1960. Of the remaining trees, 16 ended in the nineteenth (all but two showing signs of cutting), 9 in the eighteenth (4 likely cut), 11 in the seventeenth (6 likely cut), and two in the sixteenth century (not cut).\nThe bulk (111) of the dated samples originated from the Yenisei river catchment. They were combined into an independent (of the reference) chronology spanning from 1477 to 1988 CE (Fig. 4c). Yenisei DW was found at all sites. High (>10 trees) replication is attained in the 1700s, making the first part quite uncertain. The 29 samples originating from the Dvina-Pechora catchment were also assembled into a chronology spanning the period 1525\u20131982 CE (Fig. 4d). Similar to the Yenisei data, the chronology was mainly made up by recent wood. Both Yenisei and Dvina-Pechora chronologies showed the highest replication between c. 1850 and 1920. The majority of the samples contributing to both chronologies were from south-western Svalbard (Fig. 4e). Additionally, eight PISY samples originated from Lena, and three from Ob.\n\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nThe origin of DW on eastern and south-western Svalbard\nMost DW from eastern and south-western Svalbard originated from northern Russia, and the majority of the dated DW on the present beaches showed signs of logging. This is in agreement with recent studies on Svalbard (H\u00e4ggblom 1982; Eggertsson 1994; Hellman et al. 2013, 2017). Almost 90% of the forested areas of the former Soviet Union were located in its northern regions (Katkoff 1940), which are drained by large rivers into the Arctic Ocean. Because limited access by railways or roads into those regions, harvested timber was transported, floated, on rivers. However, large amounts of timber were lost during the floating because of raft wreckage, spring floods and storms (Alekseyenko and Titova 1988). Thus, the relative abundance of pine, spruce and larch, and their provenance, in the modern material, reflect the logging activity at the time of their harvesting, but also the dominating forest types of the regions of their origin (Hellman et al., 2016c). Most dated LASP and PISY were derived from the Yenisei river catchment, with a clear predominance of PISY. The Yenisei is the largest river with the highest average annual discharge of the Eurasian rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean (Peterson et al., 2002), and pine and larch are common forest types in that region (Hellman et al., 2016c). Spruce was more dominant in the DW derived from north-western Russia, emerging from the Dvina and Pechora Rivers. Logging activities in the Arkhangelsk region started already in the seventeenth century, but the region became one of Russia's main forest industry regions in the 1930s\u20131940s (Pashkevich 2003). The higher abundance of PCSP in this region relative to PISY and LASP reflects the forest composition, where spruce is by far the most common tree species (Karvinen et al., 2006), and has also been indicated by DW composition in the Northern Dvina delta (Johansen 2001).\nFinding PCSP DW from North America in Svalbard is unusual, but not unique. Our results corroborate those of Salvigsen (1981) and Salvigsen and Mangerud (1991), who found a few samples of Picea mariana on Svensk\u00f8ya, located ca. 20\u00a0km southwest of Kongs\u00f8ya, and at Agardhbukta, eastern Spitsbergen. Because the Mackenzie River feeds directly into the Arctic Ocean, finding DW from that region is not surprising. Wood from the Yukon River, however, needs to be transported northwards through the Bering Strait to enter the Arctic Ocean. This is facilitated by the Alaskan Coastal Current, and a multi-decadal mean northward transport through the Bering Strait, especially during summer (Danielson et al., 2014). Although some southward sea ice transport from the Chukchi Sea into the Bering Sea may occur during winter, it is usually short lived (Babb et al., 2013). Thus, any ice bound DW entering the Arctic Ocean is likely to enter the Beaufort Gyre (BG) and eventually the Transpolar Drift (TPD) rather than returning to the Pacific Ocean. However, it is likely that most DW originating from North America, especially from the Yukon River, ends up closer to their sources.\nHaving entered the Arctic Ocean, DW must to be frozen into sea ice to reach deep into the Arctic. The sea ice drift is controlled by the BG and the TPD, the latter being a strong current reaching from the Siberian coast to the Fram Strait west of Svalbard (Olason and Notz 2014), where the drift speed is related to wind forcing (Hakkinen et al., 2008). Sea ice from most Russian rivers drift towards and then become transported by the TPD, and it has been estimated that ice-rafted material from the northern Russian coast drifts towards Fram Strait with an average speed of 7\u00a0km per day (Krumpen et al., 2019), resulting in a journey of at least 2\u20133 years (Dalaiden et al., 2018). As noted above, North American DW ending up on Svalbard will likely have experienced a passage through the Beaufort gyre, making its journey across the Arctic much longer.\nTo estimate the time it takes DW to end up on Svalbard, several factors need to be considered. As noted in section 1, there are limits to how long a tree can stay afloat (see H\u00e4gglund 1982). However, it is possible that a stranded tree (e.g. caught in a riverbank or washed up on a beach) can continue its journey several years after having been deposited if it dries out sufficiently. This likely also applies to DW, where pieces of wood can be displaced from one beach, by e.g. storms, and subsequently washed up on another beach (this has actually been observed by the authors on Greenland). Moreover, changes in the speed and placement of the TPD, linked to shifts in high latitude storm tracks and the Arctic Oscillation (Rigor et al., 2002; Hakkinen et al., 2008), can affect the transition time for DW, where in periods of a colder than present Arctic the drift is slower. Together with the possibility that parts of the trees have been eroded during the passage across the Arctic Ocean, causing a loss of the outermost rings, these factors make it difficult to get an accurate estimate of the time it takes a tree from dying\/logging until it reaches Svalbard.\n\n\n4.2\nDW dating\nThere were notable differences among the three leading genera\/species regarding the dating\/provenance success, and there are several reasons for this. Samples containing few annual rings are difficult to crossdate, where in general at least 80\u2013100 rings are required to get a reliable dating. How many rings are required depends on the growth patterns, where series from complacent trees (i.e. those showing little year-to-year growth variability) require more rings to date than those from trees more sensitive to climate and the environment. In addition, trees having grown close to the river banks may develop anomalous growth patterns if they start to tilt before falling into the water, so called reaction wood, which can cause problems when crossdating. Missing rings, commonly found in larch (see below) can also hamper dating.\nAnother reason could be that the DW dates before the reference chronologies. While the majority of the DW was collected at the present beaches, with clear signs of having been logged, part of the material was collected at elevations above the present storm beach elevation, estimated to be above ca. 6 m a.s.l. at the sampled locations (Forman et al., 2004). This applies to DW samples from Kongs\u00f8ya (Kap Andreassen and T\u00f6mmerneset), but also some of the samples from G\u00e5shamna. Other DW samples, e.g. from Dunderdalen and Reinsletta were found at long distances from the water (>100\u00a0m) or being buried, suggesting old age.\n\n\n4.3\nDW as sea-ice indicators\nThe occurrence of DW has been associated with multi-year sea ice being present at that time (H\u00e4gglund 1982; Funder). Thus, periods without DW would indicate low sea-ice concentrations or reduced perennial ice. On the other hand, sea-ice being in contact with land can hinder DW from being delivered to beaches. Fig. 5\n shows the average sea-ice extent in September, the month with least sea ice, around Svalbard. During the last four decades, neither Kongs\u00f8ya nor the coast of south-western Svalbard have been blocked by sea ice during summer, suggesting a free DW transport to (and from) the beaches. However, it is possible that during colder climates, sea-ice has been present also in the outer parts of Bellsund and Hornsund, and surrounding Kong Karls Land, restricting DW to reach the beaches. Thus, in order to interpret DW abundance in terms of sea-ice variations, knowledge of local sea ice conditions would add to the validity of the interpretations. This can be obtained from proxies such as coralline algae, which are sensitive to light conditions and produce growth bands similar to bivalves, and have been used to reconstruct sea-ice cover variations in Svalbard and the Canadian Arctic (Halfar et al., 2013; Hetzinger et al., 2019). In this respect, also temporal variations in the warm Norwegian\/West Spitsbergen Current system, which influences sea ice around Svalbard (Stein 2019), could be relevant.\nAnother factor that need to be considered when assessing DW as an indicator of sea-ice variations, are the temporal patterns of DW export from the source river basins where the tree grows. Trees falling into rivers are mainly due to bank or undercutting erosion, and maximum erosion occurs when water levels are high, e.g. during floods (Alix 2005); very large quantities of wood can be moved during extreme flood events (Mao et al., 2013). Pulses of DW export can reflect decadal to multi-decadal discharge patterns redistributing wood derived from bank erosion and channel migration (Kramer et al., 2017). Moreover, DW has been important sources for building material, fuel and artefacts for Arctic communities (Alix 2005; Mooney 2016), resulting in continuous removal of DW through time.\n\n\n4.4\nExtending pan-arctic tree-ring chronologies with DW\nOne of the main results from this study was that four independent chronologies were constructed from the Svalbard DW material. Although only two chronologies extended beyond the reference chronologies (Dvina PISY DW 1525\u20131982 vs reference 1594\u20132011 and Yenisei PISY DW 1477\u20131988 vs reference 1584\u20132010), our results show that there are good possibilities for further extensions of existing northern Russian tree-ring chronologies. The next step will be to compile all existing data from DW and living trees to update and extend the pan-Arctic tree-ring data network. By adding the DW time series to the existing regional chronologies, more robust and reliable time series will be obtained, and this will be especially beneficial in the early, less well-replicated, parts of the original chronologies. Furthermore, it is possible to increase the spatial precision of where the DW originated (see Hellman et al., 2017). Thus, using local-scale reference chronologies, it is possible to determine more precisely (compared to a vast river catchment) the growth place of a DW. In addition to adding more detailed spatial climate information from the tree rings, this could be useful when understanding river dynamics associated with the DW formation.\nThe potential of finding DW in the Arctic from most of the Holocene have been demonstrated in many studies using 14C dating of wood material (see synthesis by Hole and Macias-Fauria, 2017). However, the paleoclimatological potential of the already collected data is limited, since they were not collected with focus on dendrochronological analyses. Interestingly, the early DW studies included measuring of ring-widths to establish the growth environments of the determined species: larger rings from southerly regions and smaller rings from northerly ones (Agardh 1869; Ingvarson 1903). However, there are good potentials to extend tree-ring chronologies far beyond the present. Well-preserved DW from above the present beaches can provide old material useful for dendrochronological studies. A recent study from Nordaustlandet, northeastern Svalbard, showed that DW from elevations of ca. 10\u201330\u00a0m a.s.l., corresponding to where most of our old material was found, were between 3000 and 9000 years old (Schomacker et al., 2019). Nevertheless, to find several thousand years old DW overlapping in time, which can be used to build chronologies, is a difficult task if only data from a few locations are used. However, the chance to achieve this would increase if all DW collected over the years could be compiled and analysed together.\nBased on earlier findings from Svalbard, as well as from the present study, LASP is the species which is most abundant throughout the Holocene. Of the dated DW samples from Svalbard presented by Hole and Macias-Fauria (2017), more than 50% were LASP. Both PCSP and PISY are more rarely found preserved. Unfortunately, of these three DW species, LASP offers problems to crossdate due to frequent missing rings (up to 5\u201310% in one radius, Hantemirov and Shiyatov, 2002), making it more difficult to date and provenance. On the other hand, there exist some millennial long Larix chronologies from Russia (see Hellman et al., 2016a), which could be useful as references. If future LASP collection is focused on DW in relatively good conditions (i.e. not severely decomposed) with sufficient number of rings (>c. 150), there are good possibilities to improve and extend existing Larix chronologies well back in time. This would provide much needed climate information from a region largely devoid of accessible long-term paleoclimate data.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nOut of nearly 400 DW samples, the majority belonged to the genera\/species Picea sp., Larix sp. and Pinus sylvestris. Of the 60% that could be dated and the provenance determined using dendrochronological methods, all samples, except five originating in North America, came from northern Russia. The high dating success relates to most DW samples having been found on or close to the present beaches, corresponding in time to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, periods with high logging activity in Russia. Four partly well replicated tree-ring width chronologies, which crossdated with existing reference chronologies, were assembled representing the Dvina-Pechora and Yenisei regions, demonstrating the potential to extend regional chronologies back in time. The undated material (mainly Picea and Larix) collected from relict beaches on elevations above the present beach zones, were likely older than the reference chronologies, providing means to extend pan-Arctic tree-ring chronologies back in the Holocene. In order to utilise Arctic DW as a proxy for past sea ice conditions, efforts are needed to compile and date more, and especially older, material, and combine DW data with other sea-ice proxies, to reduce the uncertainties associated with the timing of transportation and deposition of DW in the Arctic.\n\n","112":"","113":"","114":"","115":"","116":"","117":"","118":"","119":""},"Creator":{"0":["Silyakova, Anna","Nomura, Daiki","Kotovitch, Marie","Fransson, Agneta","Delille, Bruno","Chierici, Melissa","Granskog, Mats A."],"1":["Wang, Kunshan","Shi, Xuefa","Yao, Zhengquan","Bosin, Aleksandr A.","Hu, Limin"],"2":["Shin, Nagai","Kotani, Ayumi","Maruya, Yasuyuki","Gavrilyeva, Tuyara"],"3":["Wen, Hongtao","Yang, Yanming","Zhou, Hongtao","Wei, Shiyan","Ruan, Hailin","Mo, Xuejing"],"4":["Balogun, Olalekan","Bello, Richard","Higuchi, Kaz"],"5":["Hulswar, Shrivardhan","Mohite, Prajakta","Mahajan, Anoop S."],"6":["Krasheninnikov, Andrey B.","Gavrilo, Maria V.","Elkin, Andrey A.","Moseev, Dmitry S.","Kaigorodov, Roman V.","Toropov, Leonid I."],"7":["Chizhova, Ju.N.","Babkin, E.M.","Zazovskaya, E.P.","Khomutov, A.V."],"8":["Kamara, Mouctar","Said, Said Mohamed"],"9":["Alkan, Reha Metin","Erol, Serdar","Mutlu, Bilal"],"10":["Ogawa, Akito","Jimi, Naoto","Hiruta, Shimpei F.","Chen, Chong","Kobayashi, Itaru","Pratama, Gregorius Altius","Tanaka, Hayate","Okanishi, Masanori","Komatsu, Hironori","Ikehara, Minoru"],"11":["Sinharay, Rajib Kumar"],"12":["Nikolaeva, Nadezhda Anisimovna","Salova, Tatiana Aleksandrovna","Kopyrina, Lyubov Innokentievna","Pinigin, Dmitry Dmitrievich"],"13":["Kimura, M.","Yamaguchi, A."],"14":["Kobayashi, Fumihisa"],"15":["Ballinger, Thomas J.","Overland, James E."],"16":["Schmidt, Niels Martin","Roslin, Tomas","Hansen, Lars Holst","Gilg, Olivier","Lang, Johannes","Sittler, Benoit","Hansen, Jannik","Bollache, Lo\u00efc","Vesterinen, Eero"],"17":["Criales-Hern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda Isabel","Jerez-Guerrero, Mauricio","Latandret-Solana, Sadid A.","G\u00f3mez-S\u00e1nchez, Miguel Diego"],"18":["Iliushin, Vadim A.","Kirtsideli, Irina Y.","Vlasov, Dmitry Y."],"19":["Kakareka, Sergey","Kukharchyk, Tamara","Kurman, Peter"],"20":["Chen, Xiangcai","Liu, Jianjun","Liu, Ruiyuan","Hu, Hongqiao","Zhang, Beichen","Yukimatu, Akira Sessai"],"21":["Saito, Kazuyuki","Okuno, Jun'ichi","Machiya, Hirokazu","Iwahana, Go","Ohno, Hiroshi","Yokohata, Tokuta"],"22":["Bhakta, Sukumar","Rout, Tofan Kumar","Karmakar, Dipti","Pawar, Chandrakant","Padhy, Pratap Kumar"],"23":["Garg, Vaibhav","Thakur, Praveen K.","Rajak, D.
